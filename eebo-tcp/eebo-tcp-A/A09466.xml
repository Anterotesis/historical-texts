            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, it is a thing to be considered, that a man may seeme both vnto himself and to the Church of God to bee a true professour of the Gospel, and yet indeede be none. All professours that are of this sort, are excellently described, Luke 8. vers. 13. in these words: <hi>And they which are vpon the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ground are they, which when they shall heare, receiue the word with ioy: but hauing no roote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for a time, and in the time of temptation goe awaie:</hi> where are to bee noted three thinges. First, their faith, in that they are saide to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for a season. Secondly, the fruits of that faith, in that they are said to receiue the word preached with ioy. Thirdly, their vnsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in that they are compared to stony ground, and in the time of temptation goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Concerning their faith, whereas the spirit of God saith, that they doe beleeue, these thinges are to bee considered: first, that they haue the knowledge of the word of God: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they both can and doe giue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:14870:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto the worde of God, that it is most true. Thirdly, in more speciall manner they giue assent vnto the couenant of grace made in Christ, that it is most certaine and sure: and they are perswaded in a generall and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manner, that God will verifie the same couenant in the members of his Church. I his is all their faith; which indeede proceedeth from the holie Ghost, but yet it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make them sound professours. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they doe generally beleeue Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, yet herein they deceiue themselues, that they neuer applie and appropriate the same promises to their owne soules. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this faith wee haue, Iohn 2. vers. 24. where it is said: that when our Sauior Christ came to Ierusalem at the feast of Easter, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie beleeued in his name, &amp; yet he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himselfe vnto them, because he knew them al, and what was in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come to the second thing, those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours which are indewed with thus much grace, as to beleeue in Christ in a confused manner, goe yet further: for this their faith, though it be not sufficient to saluation, yet it sheweth it selfe by certaine fruites which it bringeth forth: for as a tree, or a braunch of a tree that hath no deepe rooting, but either is couered with a few moules, or els lieth in the water, at the season of the yeare bringeth
<pb facs="tcp:14870:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forth leaues and blossomes, and some fruite too, and that for one or two, or mo yeares: so one that is an hearer of the worde, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word, and the word as seed, by this generall faith may bee somewhat rooted in his heart and setled for a season, and may bring forth some fruits in his life, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very faire in his owne and other mens eies: yet indeede neither sound nor lasting, nor substantiall. What these fruits are, it may be gathered forth of these words, where it is saide, <hi>that they receiue the word with ioy,</hi> when they heare it: for here may be gathered: First,<note place="margin">1.</note> that they doe willingly subiect themselues to the ministerie of the word: secondly, that<note place="margin">2.</note> they are as forwarde as any, and as ioyfull in frequenting Sermons: thirdly, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence<note place="margin">3.</note> the Ministers whom they so ioyfully heare: lastly, they condemne them of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">4.</note> which will not bee hearers, or bee negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearers of the word. Now, of these and such like fruites, this may bee added: though they are not sound, yet they are voide of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie. For the mindes of those professours<note place="margin">Mark, that there is a true faith, wrought by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, verie like sauing faith, yet no sauing faith.</note> are in part inlightened, and their hearts are indued with such a faith, as may bring forth these fruites for a time: and therefore herein they dissemble not that faith which they haue not: but rather shewe that which they haue. Adde hereunto, that a man being in this
<pb facs="tcp:14870:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
estate, may deceiue himselfe and the most godly in the worlde, which haue the greatest giftes of discerning, how they and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren stand before the Lorde: like as the fig tree with greene leaues deceiued our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ as hee was man: for when in his hunger hee came vnto it to haue had some fruit, he found none.</p>
            <p>If this be so, it may be then required, how these vnsounde professours differ from true professours. I answere, in this they differ, that they haue not sounde hearts to cleaue vnto Christ Iesus for euer. Which appeareth in that they are compared to stonie grounde. Now, stony groundes mingled with some earth are commonly hot, and therefore haue as it were some alacrity and hastines in them, and the corne as soone as it is cast into this ground it sprouteth out very speedily, but yet the stones wil not suffer the corne to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deepely beneath, and therefore when Summer commeth the blade of the corne wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth with roots and all. So it is with these professours: they haue in their hearts some good motions by the holy Ghost, to that which is good: they haue a kinde of zeale to Gods worde, they haue a liking to good things, and they are as forwarde as any other for a time, and they doe beleeue. But these good motions and graces are not lasting, but
<pb facs="tcp:14870:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like the flame and flashing of strawe and stubble: neither are they sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>With the true professours it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for they haue vpright and <hi>honest hearts before the Lord.</hi> Luke 8. vers. 15. <hi>And they haue faith which worketh by loue.</hi> Galath. 5. vers. 6. And that Christian man which loueth God, whatsoeuer shall befall, yea though it were a thousand deaths, yet his heart can neuer bee seuered from the Lord and from his Sauiour Christ: as the spowse speaketh vnto Christ of hir owne loue, Cant. 8. vers. 6. <hi>Set me as a seale on thy heart, and as a signet vppon thy arme: for loue is as strong as death: Iealousie is as cruell as the graue; the coales thereof are fierie coales and a vehement flame. Much water cannot quench loue, neither can the floudes drowne it: if a man should giue all the substance of his house for loue, they would greatlie contemne it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore (good Reader) seeing there is such a similitude and affinitie betweene the temporary professour of the Gospell, and the true professour of the same: it is the duetie of euery Christian to try and examine himselfe whether hee be in the faith or not. 2. Cor. 13. vers. 5. And whereas it is an harde thing for a man to search out his owne heart, we are to pray vnto God that he would giue vs his spirit to discerne betweene that which is good and euill in vs. Nowe, when a man

Gods word is like seede; which that it may bring forth fruit vnto euerlasting life, it must bee first receiued of the ground: secondly, it must be rooted: the receiuing of it, is when it pearceth to the heart, and the affections take holde of it. This rooting is of two sorts: the first is, when the word rooteth, but not with the residue of the affections.

The first kind of rooting of the word, befalleth to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, who vnderstandeth, and reioyceth in the promises of saluation, yet hee doth not put any confidence in them: he cannot rest in them, hee doth not reioice that his name is written in the booke of life, hee doth not worke out his saluation with feare &amp; tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

               <p>Thus it commeth to passe, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate falleth away from faith in the day of triall and temptation, but the elect can not be changed.</p>
               <p>By this which hath beene saide, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christian religion are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of two things. First, <note n="q" place="margin">Phil. 2. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 17 Rom. 11. 20.</note> that they vse most painefull diligence in working their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in attaining to faith, in dying to sinne, in liuing to newnes of life: and that their harts be neuer at rest, till such time as they go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde all reprobates in the profession of Christ Iesus: Seest thou howe farre a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate may goe? presse on the straite gate with maine and might: with all violence lay hold on the kingdome of heauen. Shall Herode feare and reuerence Iohn Baptist, and heare him gladly? and wilt thou neglect the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the preaching of the worde? shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14870:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pharao confesse his sinne, nay shall Sathan beleeue and tremble? and wilt not thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile and lament thy sinnes, and thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conuersation? it behoueth thee to feare and take heede, least wicked men, and the diuel himselfe rise in iudgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thy life. For if thou shalt come short of the dueties of a reprobate, and doe not goe beyonde him in the profession of the Gospell, sure it is, thou must looke for the reward of a reprobate. The second thing is, that the professor of the Gospell, <note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 11 31. Psal. 19. 12. &amp; 119. ver. 59.</note> diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly try and examine himselfe, whether hee is in the state of damnation, or in the state of grace: whether he yet beare the yoke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or is the adopted child of God. Thou wilt say, this neede not, thou professest the Gospell, and art taken for a Christian: Yet marke and consider, that this often befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth reprobates to be esteemed Christians: and they are often so like them, <note n="s" place="margin">Math. 25. 32. 33.</note> that none but Christ can discerne the sheep from the Goates, true Christians from apparent Christians. Wherefore it behoueth all men that shewe themselues to bee Christians, to lay aside all pride, and all selfeloue, and with singlenes of heart to put themselues into the ballance of Gods word, and to make iust

Iudas who (no doubt) often preached mercy and redemption by Christ in the security of his hart, when Gods hand was vpon him, and the Lorde made him see the vilenes of his treachery: hee coulde not comfort himselfe in Christ, if one woulde haue giuen him ten thousand worlds, but in an hellish horror of conscience hanged him selfe desperately; which sheweth what a wonderfull harde thing it is at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant when a man is touched for his sinnes,

               <p>In the feeling of this sorrow, three things are to be obserued. The first: all men must look that it be seriously &amp; soundly wrought in their hearts: for looke as men vse to break hard stones into many small pieces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dust: so must this feeling of Gods anger for sinne bruse the heart of a poore sinner and bring it to nothing. And that this may so be, sorrow is not to be felt for a brunt, but very often before the ende of a mans life. The Godly man <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 88 verse 15.</note> 
                  <hi>from his youth suffereth the terrors of God.</hi> Iacob wrestling with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel gets the victory of him, <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 32 verse 25.</note> but yet hee is faine to goe halting to his graue, and trale one of his loines after him continually. <note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 12. 8 Zach. 12. 10</note> The paschal Lamb was neuer eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sowre hearbes, to signifie that they which will bee free from the wrath of God by Iesus Christ, must feele continually the smart of their owne sinnes. The second: all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14870:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men must take heede, least when they are touched for their sinnes, they besnare their own consciences, for if the sorrow be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ouer sharpe, they shall see themselues euen brought to the gates of hell, and to feele the pangues of death. And when a man is in this perplexitie, he shall finde it a most hard matter to be freed from it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the maruelous power and strength of Christ Iesus, who onely is able to helpe him and comfort him: yea many when they are once plunged in this distresse, and anguish of soule shall neuer escape it, as may appear in Caine, Saul, Achitophel, Iudas, and now of late in Iohn Hoffmeister a monke, &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomus, who for the space of certaine daies neuer left crying that hee was damned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that hee had wilfully persecuted the Gospell of Christ, and so he ended his life. Therefore most worthie is Paules counsell for the moderating of this sorrow: <note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. verse 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> (saith he) <hi>vnto the incestuous man that hee was rebuked of manie, so that now contrariwise ye ought rather to forgiue him and comfort him, lest he shoulde be swallowed vp of ouermuch heauines.</hi> And further hee giueth another reason, which followeth, <hi>lest Sathan should circumuent vs: for we are not ignorant of his enterprises.</hi> And

indeed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce sheweth the same, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man is most weak, then Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most of all bestirreth himselfe to worke his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion.

After the consideration of Gods<note place="margin">2 Feeling of the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christ.</note> mercie in Christ: he commes in the second place, to see, feele, and from his heart to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himselfe to stande in neede of Christ and to stand in neede of euerie drop of his most pretious bloude. Thirdlie the<note place="margin">3 Desire.</note> Lorde stirreth vp in his heart a vehement desire and longing after Christ and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: this desire is compared to <note n="a" place="margin">Reu. 21. verse 6.

               <p>For the better vnderstanding of this that God worketh, <hi>sowing faith</hi> in the hart of man after this manner; it must bee obserued that a sinner is compared <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 4. 18 Math. 9. 11 12.</note> to a sicke man oft in the scriptures. And therefore that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a disease fitly resembleth the curing of sinne. A man that hath a disease or sore in his bodie before hee can bee cured of it, hee must see it, feele paine of it, and be in a feare lest it bring him into danger of death: after this, he shall see himselfe to stande in neede of Phisick, and he longeth till he be with the Phisitian: when he is once come to him, he desireth him of all loues to helpe him &amp; to shew the best skill he can: he will not spare for any cost: then he yeeldes himselfe into the Phisitians handes, perswading himselfe, that by Gods blessing, he both can and will helpe him: after this he comes to his former health againe. On the same manner, euerie man is wounded with the deadly wound of sinne at the very heart: and he that woulde bee saued and escape damnation, must see his sinne, bee sorrowfull for it, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dispaire of his owne strength to attaine

saluation thereby: furthermore he must see himselfe to stande in neede of Christ, the good Phisition of his soule, and long after him, and crie vnto him with deepe sighes and grones for mercie: after this Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus will temper him a plaister, of his owne heart bloud, which beeing applied, he shall finde himselfe reuiued, and shall come to the assurance of the forgiuenes of all his sinnes. So it was in Dauid, when he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his adulterie and murther. First God made him see his sinnes, for he saith, <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 51. verse 3.</note> 
                  <hi>I know mine iniquities, and my sinnes are euer before me.</hi> Secondly, he felt Gods anger for his sinnes, <note n="f" place="margin">verse 8.</note> 
                  <hi>make me</hi> (saith he) <hi>to heare ioy and gladnes, that the bones which thou hast broken may reioice.</hi> Thirdly hee vtterly dispaired of his owne strength, in that he said, <note n="g" place="margin">verse 12.</note> 
                  <hi>stablish me with thy free spirit;</hi> signifying therby, vnlesse the Lord woulde staie him with his glorious power, he should run headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Fourthly he comes to see himselfe stand in great neede of Gods fauour: <note n="h" place="margin">verse 1.</note> one mercie will not content him: hee praieth for the whole innumerable multitude of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to bee bestowed on him, to doe away his iniquities. Fiftly, his desire and his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the forgiuenes of his sin, are set down
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14870:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the whole Psalme. And in his praier hee gathereth some comfort, and assurance of Gods mercie towardes himselfe, in that he saith, <hi>the sacrifices of God are a contrite spirit:</hi>

               <p>A litle faith may more plainly be known by considering these foure points: first that it is onely in his heart, who is humbled for sinne: <note n="x" place="margin">Esai. 51. verse 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Lord dwelleth with him, that is of a contrite and humble spirite, to receiue the spirite of the humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart.</hi> Secondly, it is in a man espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the time of his conuersion, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Christ, after which hee is to growe from faith to faith. Thirdly, this faith though it <hi>be in</hi> the hart, yet it is not so much <hi>felt in</hi> the heart: this was in Dauid at some times, <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. verse 1.</note> 
                  <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> saith he. The first wordes <hi>my God, my God,</hi> are speeches of faith: yet the latter, <hi>why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> shewe that then he had no feeling of Gods mercie. A little faith then is in the heart of a man, as in the spring time the fruit is in the bud, which yet appeareth not, but only hath his nature and substance in the bud. Lastly, the beginnings and seeds of this faith are three.</p>
               <p>The first is a persuasion, that a mans own<note place="margin">1 A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that sinne is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</note> sins are pardonable: this perswasion though it bee not faith, yet it is a good preparation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14870:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to faith: For the wicked cut themselues of quite from Gods mercie, in that with Cain <note n="a" place="margin">4. Gen. 3 2 A desire of grace.</note> they say, their sinnes are greater, then that they can be forgiuen. The second is a desire of the fauor &amp; mercy of God in Christ, &amp; of the meanes to attaine to that fauour. <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 56 Luk. 1. 53. Psal. 145. 19. Psal. 10. 17. &amp; 38. 9. Num. 23. 9.</note> This desire is a speciall grace of God, and it hath the promise of blessednes; and it must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from that desire which wicked men haue: who though they desire life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as Balam did, yet they cannot desire the meanes, as faith, repentance, mortification, &amp;c. The third is, praier for nothing in this<note place="margin">3 Praier for pardon</note> world, but onely for the forgiuenes of their sins: with great sighes and grones, from the bottome of the heart, which they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expresse, as they feele them. Nowe this hearty praying and desire for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne can neuer come from the flesh but onely from the spirite, who <note n="c" place="margin">Ro. 8. 25.</note> stirreth vp these heauenly motions of longing, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, sighing after remission of sinne, and all other graces of God, which hee bestoweth vpon his children. And where the spirit of Christ dwelleth there must needs be faith, for <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17</note> Christ dwelleth in the harts of the faith full by faith. Therfore as Rebecca, <note place="margin">Ge. 25. 22</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she felt the Twins striue in hir wombe, though
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14870:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it pained hir, yet shee knewe, both that she had conceaued, and that the children were quicke in hir: so they who haue these moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; holy affections in them before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned may assure themselues, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwelleth in them, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently that they haue faith though a weake faith.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="19" type="item">
               <head>XIX.</head>
               <p>Examples of this small faith are euident in the Apostles, who though <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 16</note> they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that Christ was the sauior of the world, yet they <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 17. 23. Luke 9. 45.</note> were ignorant of his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, which are the chiefe meanes of saluation. After his resurrection they were ignorant of his ascention, &amp; of his spiritual kingdome, for they dreamed <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 1. 6.</note> of an earthly kingdome; &amp; at his death they all fled from him, and Peter fearefully denied him. They being in this estate are not saide to haue no faith, but to be of <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 8. 29</note> litle faith. Another exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we haue in Dauid, who hauing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g space in his two great sins, adultery &amp; murther, was admonished therof by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than the Prophet: being admonished he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed his sins, and strait way Nathan decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him from the Lord the forgiuenes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet afterward Dauid humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as it appeareth in the 51. Psalme, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14870:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
praieth most earnestly for the forgiuenes of those and all other his sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen as though it had not beene true, that they were forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as Nathan tolde him: The reason is: howsoeuer they were remitted before God, yet Dauid at his first repenting of them, felt none assurance in his heart of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of them, onely he had a persuasion, that they might be pardoned. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee vehemently desired and praied to the Lorde, to remitte them, and to sanctifie him anewe. This then beeing the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of faith, it must be remembred, that he who hath not attained to it, hath as yet no sauing faith at all.</p>

experience of Gods fauour at sundry times, and after sundrie manners. For before he set down this resolution, he numbred vp diuers benefites receaued of the Lord: that <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 23. 2. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>he fed him in greene pastures, &amp; led him by the refreshing waters</hi> of Gods word. That he <hi>restoreth him &amp; leadeth him</hi> in the pathes of righteousnes. That he strengthneth him in great dangers, euen of death, and preserueth him, that in despight of his enemies, hee enriched him with many benefites. By meanes of all these mercies of God bestowed on him he came to be perswaded of the continuance of the fauour of God towards him.

In sinne, there are three things which are hurtfull to man: the first is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> which commeth of sinne: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde is, the <hi>disobedience</hi> of the law in sinne: the third is, the root and fountaine of sinne, <hi>originall corruption.</hi> These are three deadly woundes, and three running sores in the hearts and consciences of all sinners. <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 1. 35 Coloss. 2. 9.

For the guilt and punishment of sinne was borne of Christ. Now therefore, if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian bee afflicted, it is no punishment: for then God shoulde punish one fault twise, once in Christ, and the seconde time vpon the Christian: which thing doth not agree with his iustice: it remaineth therefore that afflictions are only corrections in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14870:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>

First, let the beleeuing Christian examine himselfe, whether his conscience was afflicted with the sense of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pressed downe with the burden of his sinne before hee came to that quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: for then he may be in good hope, that it was the Spirit of God who brought that peace, because God hath promised <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh 7. 37.

                  <hi>That he will dwell with the humble and contrite, to reuiue and quicken them.</hi> But if hee haue alwayes had that peace from the beginning of his dayes, he maie easilie deceiue himselfe, by taking the numnesse and securitie of a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led conscience for true peace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. Secondly, let him search from whence this<note place="margin">2</note> peace of his conscience proceedeth. <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 5. 1 Heb. 9. 14.</note> For if it come from anie thing else but from the certaintie of the remission of sinne, it is no true peace: as manie, flattering themselues in sinne, and dreaming of a pardon, are therevpon quieted, and the Deuill is readie enough to put this into their mindes: but this can bee no true peace. Thirdlie, let him examine himselfe, if he haue a care to keepe a good conscience: which if hee haue, he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14870:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath also reciued from the Lord a good and a quiet conscience. <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 23. 1. &amp; 24. 16.</note> For if God bestowe vpon anie man a gift concerning his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he giueth him also a care to keepe it.</p>

Christian is thus affected, that rather then God shall loose his glorie, he is content to haue his own soule damned, As it was with Moses, who feared, least God should loose his glorie, if he did vtterlie destroy the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elits for their Idolatrie: whom he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to be his people, &amp; therefore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect praied vnto the Lord. <note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 32. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Therefore nowe if thou pardon their sinne, thy mercie shall appeare, but if thou wilt not, I pray thee, rase me out of the booke which thou hast written.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 9. 3</note> And Paul could haue wished with all his hart to bee cut off from all fellowship with Christ, and to bee giuen vp to eternal destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men the Iewes, &amp; for Gods glory speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie. Some may say this affection is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, but particular to such as are led with such an affection, as these holie men were led, &amp; which haue their harts so pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced &amp; kindled with diuine loue, and so raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the same, out of themselues, that they forget al other things, yea themselues, hauing nothing before their eyes but God, and his glorie. To this I answere that this affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al, though the measure of it be diuers, in some more, in some lesse. which appeareth in that our sauiour Christ teacheth euery one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his praier which hee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14870:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made before he craue any other thing, either concerning God, or himselfe, to pray that Gods name may be sanctified. For by this all Christians are taught that they are to ouerpasse all considerations of themselues, their owne pleasure and profit; their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or damnation: and with an heartie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to seeke after the glorie of God in all their doinges, that as Gods glorie is most deare vnto himselfe, so it may appeare also that it is most deare vnto them. If any think it strange that Moses, Paule, or any other shoulde bee content to fall into miserie, to loose their liues, and to be cast into eternall perdition, in hell fire, with reprobate and damned spirites, rather then Gods honor shoulde bee turned into dishonor and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: let them consider that wonderful is the power of true loue, <note n="c" place="margin">1.

               <p>From sanctification ariseth repentance.<note place="margin">Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> For a man cannot hate his owne sinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be sanctified: and he cannot truely repent for them before hee hate them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is when a man <note n="k" place="margin">Act 26. 20.</note> turnes to God, &amp; brings forth fruites worthie amendment of life. This turning vnto God hath two parts: The first a purpose and resolution of heart neuer to sinne any more, but to leade a new life. This was in Dauid, <note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 119. 57.</note> who fully <hi>purposed to keepe Gods commandements</hi> and <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 112 6.</note> 
                  <hi>applied his heart to fulfill his statutes vnto the end.</hi> And vnto this did Barnabas exhort the brethren at Antioch <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 11. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>that with full purpose of heart, they would cleaue vnto the Lord.</hi> The second part is an holy labour in mans life and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to purifie and cleanse himselfe from sin: of this speaketh Iohn <note n="o" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. ver. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>And euerie one that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14870:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath this hope in him, purgeth himselfe euen as hee is pure.</hi> This did Dauid practise, as may appeare in that hee saide: <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 73. 13.</note> Certainely, <hi>I haue cleansed my heart in vaine, and washed my handes in innocencie.</hi> If anie maruaile howe repentance followeth sanctification, considering it is the first thing of all, that the Prophets, Apostles, and Ministers of God preach vnto the people whome they woulde winne to Christ: I answere, that all other graces are more hidden in the heart, whereas repentance is open, and sooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to a mans owne selfe, and to the eies of the worlde. It is like the budde in the tree, which appeareth before the leafe, the blossome, the fruite: and yet in nature, it is the last, for a man must bee renewed, and come to an vtter disliking of his owne sins, before hee will turne from them, and leaue them.</p>

               <head>XLV</head>
               <p>By this it may appeare, that there is one maner of sinning in the godly, and another in the vngodly, though they fall both into one sinne. A wicked man, when he sinneth in his heart he giueth ful consent to the sin: but the godly though they fall into the same sinnes with the wicked, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14870:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
giue full consent, for they are in their minds, willes, and affections partly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and partly vnregenerate, and therefore their willes will partly abhorre that which is euill: according as saint Paule saith of himselfe <note n="q" place="margin">Ro. 7. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>I delight in the lawe of God according to the inner man, but I see an other lawe in my members rebelling against the lawe of my minde, and leading mee captiue, &amp;c.</hi> And that the godlie man neuer giueth full consent to sinne: it is euident by three tokens. First, before hee commeth to doe the sinne, hee hath no purpose nor desire to doe it: but his purpose and desire is to doe the will of God contrarie to that sinne. Secondly, in the act or doing of the sinne, his heart riseth against it, yet by the strength of temptation, and by the mightie violence of his flesh, hee is haled and pulled on to doe wickednesse. Paule saith of himselfe, that <hi>hee was solde vnder sinne,</hi> that is, hee was like a slaue, who desireth to escape out of his Maisters handes, and yet is faine in great miserie to serue him. Thirdly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee hath sinned hee is sore displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with himselfe for it, and truelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth. As <note n="r" place="margin">Math. 26. 69. 70. 71. 72.</note> Peter before the denying of his Maister, had no purpose to doe it,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14870:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but rather to die in his cause. In the act hee had a striuing with himselfe, as appeareth by this that first hee answered faintly, I knowe not what thou saist: and yet after when the assault of Sathan more preuailed, he fell to swearing, cursing and banning. After his fall he repented himselfe and wept bitterly for it. All was contrarie in Iudas, who went to betra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This good hearing of the worde is the sauing hearing that bringeth life eternall. In this action, Christians are vsually thus disposed. Before they come to heare the worde of God they make themselues readie to heare it, as the men of Berea did, <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17. 11</note> 
                  <hi>who receaued the worde with all readines.</hi> This preparation standeth in two points: First, they disburden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of all impedimentes, that like vnto runners in a race, they <hi>may</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14870:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and thirsting after the worde of God, as men doe after meate and drinke. When they are in hearing Gods worde, their minds are fixed and attentiue onely to that which is spoken, as <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> Lydias was. Thirdly, they truly beleue the word of God, &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applie it to their owne souls.

                  <hi>spirite and life</hi> to quicken and reuiue their soules that are dead in sin: And the reason of this is plaine: The word of God preached is as a cuppe of wine: the true Christian, is the Lords guest, but he hath sauce of his owne: He bringeth his suger with him, namely, his true faith, which <note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 2</note>

sealeth vp to the heart of a Christian, that he is vnited vnto Christ, and hath true fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshippe with him in being fullie iustified before God, and inwardly sanctified.

               <p>Secondlie, hee is inwardlie <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 4. 16.</note> touched with a liuelie feeling of his owne wants, but especially hee is vexed and grieued at his owne sinne and rebellion: and this sense of his miserie is as a spurre to quicken his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed heart.</p>

               <p>2 The flesh hindreth and choketh the good motions &amp; desires of the hart, as Paul saith. <note n="p" place="margin">Ro. 7. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>I see an other law in my members rebelling against the law of my mind, and leading me captiue to the law of sinne which is in my members.</hi> Again the same flesh mingleth euerie good motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and desire with some corruptions: so that the godlie mislike the best thing they doe, Esay saith of his owne &amp; the peoples righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, that it is but as a <note n="q" place="margin">Esa. 64. 6</note>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:14870:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>3 The spirit, on the contrarie, kindles in the hart good motions &amp; desires, &amp; puts a man forward to good words and deeds, as it was in Dauid. <note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 5. 24 Psal 16. 8.</note>

               </p>
               <p>4 The spirit rebuks a man for his euil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents &amp; desires, and represseth the face of them, and as it were nips them in the head. Thus Esay describeth the inward motions of the spirit, <note n="u" place="margin">Esa. 30. 21</note>

accuseth, checketh and controuleth him, &amp; he feeles it stirring in him, as if it were some liuing thing that crauled in his body, and gnawed vpon his hart, and therevpon he is verie often greeued for his sinnes, yet for all that hee liketh his sinnes verie well, and loueth them, and coulde finde in his<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Hence ariseth a notable differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, betwen the godly &amp; the wicked, in the suffering of afflictions. A reprobate the more the Lord laieth his hand on him, the more hee <note n="p" place="margin">Exod. 8.</note> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mureth &amp; rebelleth against God: it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with the true christian: None feeleth more the power &amp; rebellion of sin then he: none is more assalted by sathan then he, &amp; often times it cometh to passe that God withdraweth the signes of his fauor from him, &amp; lets him feele his wrath. And this is the greatest temptation of all other, when a man shall see the Lord to be his enimie, &amp; to his thinking to arme himself against him to his destruction. As <note n="q" place="margin">Esa. 38.</note> Ezechias did, who<note n="r" place="margin">Iob. 6. 34.</note> saith <hi>that the Lord did crash his bones like a Lion:</hi> Or as Iob saith, <hi>that the arrowes of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were in him, &amp; the venime thereof drunke vp his spirit, &amp; the terrors of god did fight against him.</hi> Yet the true Christian when the world, the flesh, &amp; the deuill, &amp; God himself too are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, doth euen then most of al rest in the Lord, &amp; by faith cleue to him <note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 13.  1.</note> Though God should destroy me, yet would I trust in him (saith Iob. <note n="s" place="margin">15 Psal. 22.</note> And Dauid saith, <hi>my God, my God why hast thou forsaken me.</hi> When he saith

that God had forsaken him, it may seeme to be the complaint of a desperate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so much as one spark of faith: yet then he saith: <hi>my God, my God:</hi> which words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a confession proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true faith: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Dauid it appeareth, that the faithful whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues forlorne, &amp; vtterly reiected of god, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sense &amp; iudg ment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh, yet by faith they can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mercy, &amp; behold it a far off in the glasse of his promise. And so they do often shew contrary affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as Dauid doth. <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 32. 28.</note> Iacob when he wrastled with the Angel for life &amp; death, neuer gaue ouer: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was foild, he wold not cease before the Lord had blessed him.

&amp; by the iudgement of the phisition is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for dead. This was the estate of Peter, who though he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed that Christ was the son of the liuing Lord <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 16. 16. 26. 70.</note> yet he denied him &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swore him at the voice of a Damsel. Thirdly he may fal againe into the same sin after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Indeed this is a dangerous fal, yet it may befal a true christian. Otherwise whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Israelits gods people had fallen away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by their sins, &amp; idolatries, he wold not stil haue offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mercie <note n="d" place="margin">Esa. 14. 18.</note> as he doth by his prophets: And <note n="e" place="margin">2.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God:</hi> who neuertheles had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bene reconciled to God. Fourthly, he may commit a sinne of presumption, which is a fearefull sinne, being done wittinglie of knowledge and willinglie, and with some wilfulnesse. Therefore Dauid prayed <note n="f" place="margin">Ps. 19. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>keepe thy seruant presumptuous sinne:</hi> and to shewe himselfe to be in danger of it, hee prayeth further, <hi>let them not haue dominion ouer mee.</hi> Lastly, hee may fall into dispaire of Gods mercie for a time, and this is a dangerous sinne. For he which dispaires, makes all the promises of God to bee false: and this sinne of all other is most contrarie to true sauing faith. In this estate was Dauid, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:14870:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being in trouble, hee said, <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 77. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>this is my death.</hi> And Paul shewes that the incestuous man might haue fallen into desperation, <note n="h" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 2.</note> when hee sayth: <hi>Comfort him, least hee bee swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of ouermuch heauinesse.</hi> And it must bee remembred that the Church of Rome erreth in this, that she teacheth des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration to bee a sinne against the holie Ghost; This sinne against the holie Ghost is a blasphemie spoken against the knowen truth of Gods worde, of a wilfull and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate malice. But desperation may arise through ignorance of a mans owne estate: through horror of conscience for sinne: through an often relapse into some sinne: through the ouerdeepe consideration of a mans owne vnworthines: Lastly by abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the truth, through compulsion &amp; feare. This befell Frances Spira, who after his Apostasie dispaired. Yet they are much ouerseene that write of him as of a damned creature. For first who can tell whether hee dispaired finally or not. Secondly in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie middest of his desperation, he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the hardnes of his heart, which made him that he could not praie: no doubt then he felt his hardnes of heart: and the feeling of corruption in the heart is by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

For he hath in him not only the sanctifying, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the strengthning power of Christ. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul praieth for the Ephesia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>that they may be strengthned in the inner ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <note n="k" place="margin">Colloss. 1. 9.</note>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14870:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a Christian in this life. Now I wil ad<note place="margin">A perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> some reasons in the way of perswasion to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but especially to worldlings, &amp; to loose professors of the Gospell, that they woulde vtterly deenie themselues <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> &amp; vse all meanes to become true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by being <hi>made new creatures in Christ,</hi> and <note n="e" place="margin">Tit. 2. 10.</note> by leading such a life as <hi>may adorne the Gospell of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My first reason is this, the man that liueth in this world nor beeing a true Christian, is farre more vile then the basest creature of all, euen the Dogge, or Toade: For first he is nothing els but a filthy dunghill of all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination and vncleannes, the <note n="f" place="margin">Ro. 8. 20.</note> stinke whereof hath infected heauen and earth, and no perfumes coulde euer delaie it in the nostrils of God, but onely the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Christ beeing <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 5. 2.</note> a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauour to God. Wee make it very daintie to come nere a lazar man that is full of botches, blaines &amp; sores; but much more are those men to bee abhorred, which haue lien many yeares starke <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>dead in sins and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes:</hi> &amp; therfore now do nothing els but rot &amp; stinke in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like vgly lothsome carrions.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, he which is no Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vnder the power of darknes hauing Sathan for his Prince <note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> and God, and giuing vnto him in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14870:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
token of homage his best partes, euen his minde and conscience <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 11. 24.</note> to bee his dwelling place: and his whole conuersation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a perperuall obedience to Sathan. If Atheists, &amp; worldlings &amp; carnal gospelers were perswaded of the truth of this (as it is most true) it would make them howle &amp; cry, though now they liue at ease without feeling any prick of conscience for sinne. And if they had but the least sense of it in the worlde, it woulde make their flintie hearts to bleede, and it woulde make them shedde riuers of teares. But how long shall they continue in this vile estate? Truely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come to Christ: awake therefore thou that sleepest, and stand vp from the dead and Christ shall giue thee light: Open thine heart to receiue Christ, and then hee will come &amp; binde the strong man Sathan, and cast him out, and dwell in thee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee which is no Christian is in danger of al the iudgements of God, so that euery moment some of them may befall him. He may perish sodainly by water with the olde world, he may bee consumed with fire and brimstone with Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha, hee may bee swallowed vp of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14870:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
earth with Core, Dathan, and Abyram, hee may hang himself with Iudas, he may haue his braines dashed against the grounde and bee eaten vp of dogs with Iesabell, he may die in the hardnes of heart with Pharao, he may dispaire with Caine and Iudas, he may be stricken with sodaine death with Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and Saphira his wife, he may be eaten of wormes with Herode, hee may bee smitten with trembling that he cannot heare Gods worde with Foelix, hee may voide his guts at the stoole with Arius, he may crie at his death that he is damned with Latomus, he may bee left vnto himselfe to mocke, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and renounce Christ with Iulian: and hee may suffer manie more fearefull iudgements, whereof the Lord hath <note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 32. 34.</note> great store and all tende to the confounding of them which will not be humbled vnder his hand. Contrariwise the true Christian is so farre out of the reach of Gods iudgements that they cannot hurt him: <note n="m" place="margin">Esal. 4. 6.</note> Christ is <hi>a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and a cloude</hi> against the heat and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of Gods iudgementes <note n="n" place="margin">Exo. 12. 22.</note> when a mans heart is sprinkled with the bloud of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lambe, all the plagues of God passe ouer him.</p>

                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ezec. 9. 4</note> righteous beare a marke in their foreheads and are saued. Therefore let him that hath regard to his owne safetie become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; the man which is no Christian is in danger of eternall death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hell fire. and they which fall into this estate it had beene ten thousand folde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them if they had neuer beene borne, <note n="p" place="margin">1. Thess. 1. 9.</note> for they are quite separated <hi>from the presence of God and from his glorie:</hi> al the company they haue is with the Diuell and his Angels. Their bodies and soules are tormented with infinite horrour and anguish arising of the feeling of the whole wrath of God, in which as into a bottomlesse sea, they are plunged.</p>
               <p>Thus they are alwaies dying, and yet are neuer deade: Furthermore the length of this torment must bee considered which greatly aggrauates the paine. If a man might be deliuered from the panges of hell when he had suffered them so many yeares as there be droppes in the sea or little sands in the whole earth, it were some comfort: but after that those yeares be expired there shall come no release, but the damned shall continue in shriking, yelling and gnashing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14870:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of teeth, enduring the consuming heate of Gods wrath without any ende for euer and euer. Yea to goe further, a wicked man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth an hell about him in this life, namely, an euill conscience, which if it bee neuer so litle touched with any of Gods anger, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall feele himselfe to haue euen the panges of hell in his heart. Nowe therefore all they that woulde escape out of this hellish and damnable estate, while they haue time let them pray for the pardon of their sinnes in Christ, and walke according to the spirite in newnes of life, and then they may assure themselues, that there is no condemnation can belong to them. And it must be alwaies remembred that he which would liue, when he is dead, must die while he is aliue, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to sinne. And againe he which would rise to eternall life in the daie of iudgement, must rise from sin before he die, vnto new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life.</p>
               <p>The fourth reason: God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto euerie man that liueth in the Church a certaine time of repentaunce, and of comming to Christ. And hee which mispendeth that time and is not made a Christian then, can neuer bee saued. This made our Sauiour Christ weepe for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14870:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hierusalem and say. <note n="q" place="margin">Luke 19. 42</note> 
                  <hi>O if thou hadst knowne at the least in this thy daie, those things which belong to thy peace, but now are they hidden from thine eies.</hi> And further signifieth the destruction of Hierusalem <note n="r" place="margin">ver. 44.</note> because she <hi>knew not the time of hir visitation.</hi> Againe, the neglecting of this time is one cause, why not one or two, but manie <note n="s" place="margin">Luke 13. ver. 24.</note> shall seek to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, and yet shall not be able. It is a maruailous thing, that they which seek to be saued should perish, but the fault is theirs which seeke when it is too late. Nowe therefore thou secure worldling, thy conscience telleth thee that thou hast not yet repented and that thou art not as yet a liuely member of Iesus Christ. And thou knowest further, that howsoeuer thou art aliue at this time, yet thou hast no lease of thy life. God may call thee foorth of this worlde the next yeare, the next weeke, the next howre: Yea he may strike thee with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine death at this very present. And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, if thou goest foorth of this world beeing no Christian, thou goest damned to hell. Wherefore delaie not one minute of an hower longer, but with all speede repent and turne vnto God, and bring forth fruites worthie of amendment of life, that all thy
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14870:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sinnes may be done away, when the day of death, or the day of iudgement shal be. And doe not thinke with thy selfe that it shall be sufficient to differre thy turning vnto God till the last ende. For late repentance is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome true repentance. And he which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth long in any sinne is in a dangerous case. If a man lie long in any disease he will scarce recouer his former health: and hee which is growen in the custome of any sin, and the sinne is become ripe in him, it is a thousand to one, he is neuer saued; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of saint Iames, <note n="t" place="margin">Iam. 1. 13</note> 
                  <hi>sinne being perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted bringeth forth death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift reason. Eternall life is a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of all men: yet none shall be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, but the true Christian, and the glorious estate of this life woulde mooue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to be a Christian. First of all, they which haue eternall life are freed from all pains, sickenesses, infirmities, hunger, thirst, cold, wearines; from all sin, as anger, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, ignorance; from hell, death, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sathan, &amp; from euery thing that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth miserie: according to that of saint Iohn, <hi>And</hi>

                  <hi>saw a pure riuer of water of life, cleere as Christal proceding out of the throne of God &amp; of the Lamb; there being by either side of it the tree of life which bare two manner of fruites, and gaue fruit euerie moneth.</hi> And whereas God is continually to be worshipped in heauen: they neede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tabernacle or temple thereunto, but God himselfe shall be their temple: as Iohn saith, <note n="d" place="margin">Reuel. 21. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>I saw no temple therein: for the Lorde God almightie and the Lambe are the temple of it.</hi> Fourthly, from this glorious communion which is betweene God and Christ as he is man, and all the saints which are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, there ariseth an vnspeakeable ioy and gladnes wherewith they are filled. Dauid saith, <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> that Gods children shall be satisfied <hi>with the fatnes of his house, and that he shall giue them drinke out of the riuers of his pleasures.</hi> This
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14870:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ioye vndoubtedlie is infinite, and the Saintes are not onelie replenished with it but they are also swallowed vp of it as with an huge and infinite sea of waters, as may appeare in Peter, who at the transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, was so rauished out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with ioy at the sight of it that he quite forgot himself, saying <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 17. 4</note> to Christ, <hi>Maister it is good being here: let vs make three tabernacles here, one for thee, one for Moses, and an other for Elias.</hi> Lastly, out of this communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth a perfect loue of God whereby the Saints loue God with all their hearts, with all their soules, and strength, and this loue sheweth it self in that they are eternally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in <note n="g" place="margin">Reuel. 8. ver. 11. 12.</note> worshipping God by singing of songes of praise and thankes giuing vnto him. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeing the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is so glorious, and none can haue it but the true Christian, let all men accompt the best thinges in this worlde <note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> as drosse and dung, so that they may obtaine Christ and his righteousnes.</p>
               <p>The last reason is the endlesse loue of Iesus Christ shewed in his death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thou art by nature the childe of wrath and vengeance. Sathan hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee with manie a deadlie wounde of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14870:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sinne: thou liest bleeding at the heart and and art like to die eternally. Thou being in this estate there is no Man on earth, no no Saint in heauen, no Angell, no creature at all is able to helpe thee; Christ onely was able; hee therefore came downe from heauen and became man, for this cause, to worke thy deliuerance. Furthermore in the curing of the wounde of sin, no hearbe, no water, no plaister, no Phisicke, can doe thee any good: onely the bodie and bloude of Christ is soueraigne for this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stieped in the wrath of GOD. Hee therefore subiected himselfe to the death, euen the death of the Crosse vpon which hee suffered the wrath of God due to the sinne of mankinde: and of his owne heart bloude hee tempered for thee a soueraigne medicine to heale all thy woundes and sores.</p>
               <p>Nowe therefore despise not this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; seeke vnto Christ, lay open all thy sores, pray him, that hee woulde vouchsafe thee if it bee but one droppe of his bloude: then he will come vnto thee by his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, he will wash and supple thy wounds in his bloud and binde them vp. He is the <note n="h" place="margin">Reuel. 22. 3.</note>

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:14870:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If thou get but one leafe of him thou art well, it will heale thee and restore thy dead soule that thou maiest liue eternallie in the kingdome of heauen. If this reason will not mooue thee to be a Christian, thy case is desperate. It is the best reason that Paule could vse to this purpose. <hi>As obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children</hi> (saith he) <hi>fashion not your selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the former lustes of your ignorance,</hi>

               <p>Thus much haue I spoken to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling who in his heart makes no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christ then of his olde shooes: and who had rather bee without Christ,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 8.</note> then be without his pigges, with the Gade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes.

               <p>For that olde acquaintance that was betweene vs, and for that you are desirous to liue a godly life in Christ Iesus, I will not conceale the good worke of my God in me: therefore I pray you marke a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle what I shall say, and I will declare vnto you the truth euen foorth of the feeling of mine owne conscience. The fall of Adam did make mee the heire of vengeance and wrath of God, and heire of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and did bring mee into captiuitie and bondage vnder the Diuell: And the Diuell was my Lorde and my ruler, my heade, my gouernor, and my prince, yea, and my god. And my will was locked &amp; knit faster vnto the will of the Diuell, then coulde an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand chaines binde a man vnto a post. Vnto the Diuels will did I consent with all my heart, with all my minde, with all my might, power, strength, will and life: so that the lawe and will of the Diuell, was written as well in my heart, as in my members, and I ran headlong after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel with full soule, and the whole swing of all the power I had: as a stone cast vp into the aire commeth downe naturally of it self with al the violent swing of his own weight. O with what deadly &amp; venemous heart did
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14870:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I hate mine enimies? with howe great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of minde inwardlie did I sley and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? With what violence and rage, yea with what seruent lust committed I adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, fornication, and such like vncleannes? With what pleasure and delectation like a glutton serued I my bellie? With what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence deceiued I? Howe busilie sought I the things of the world? whatsoeuer I did worke, imagine or speak, was abhominable in the sight of God, for I could referre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto the honour of GOD: neither was his lawe or will written in my members or in my hart, neither was there anie more power in me to followe the will of GOD then in a stone to ascend vpward of it selfe. And besides that I was a sleepe in so deepe blindnesse that I could neither see nor feele in what miserie, thraldome, and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I was, till Moses came and awaked mee and published the lawe. When I heard the lawe truelie preached how that I ought to loue and honour God with all my strength and might from the lowe bottome of the heart, because hee did create mee lord ouer it, and my neighbour, yea mine enemies as my selfe inwardlie from the ground of my heart, because God hath made them after
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14870:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the likenesse of his owne Image, and they are his sonnes as well as I, and Christ hath bought them with his bloud, and made them heires of euerlasting life as well as I: and howe I ought to doe whatsoeuer God biddeth and to abstaine from whatsoeuer God forbiddeth, with all loue and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with a feruent and burning lust from the entire of the heart. Then beganne my conscience to rage against the lawe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God. No sea, bee it neuer so great a tempest was so vnquiet, for it was not possible for mee a naturall man to consent to the lawe that it should be good, or that God should be righteous which made the lawe: in as much as it was contrarie vnto my nature, and damned mee and all that I could doe, and neuer shewed mee where to fetch helpe, nor preached any mercy <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>: but onelie set mee at variance with God, and prouoked and stirred mee to raile on God, and to blaspheme him as a cruell tyrant. And indeed it was not possible to doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, to thinke that God made me of so poisoned a nature, and gaue me an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible lawe to performe: I beeing not borne againe by the spirite, and my wit, reason, and will beeing so fast glewed, yea nailed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14870:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and cheined vnto the wil of the Diuell. This was the captiuitie and bondage whence Christ deliuered mee, redeemed and loosed me. His bloud, his death, his patience in suffering rebukes and wronges and the full wrath of God, his prayers and fastings, his meekenes &amp; fulfilling the vttermost points of the lawe, appeased the wrath of God, brought the fauour of God to mee againe, obtained that God should loue mee first, &amp; be my father, and that a mercifull father that would consider my infirmitie &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and would giue mee his spirit againe which hee had taken awaie in Adam, to rule, gouerne, and strengthen mee, and to breake the bandes of Sathan wherein I was so straight bound. When Christ was on this wise preached, and the promises rehearsed which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the booke of God, (which preaching is called the gospell or glad-tidings,) and I had deepelie considered the same: then my heart began to waxe soft &amp; melt at the bounteous mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God and kindnesse shewed of Christ. For when the gospell was preached, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God (me thought) entred into my heart, and opened my in warde eyes, and wrought a liuely faith in me, and made my

woful conscience feele and taste how sweet a thing the bitter death of Christ is, &amp; how merciful &amp; louing God is through Christs purchasing and merits, and made mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to loue againe, and to consent to the lawe of God how that it is good and ought so to bee, and that GOD is righteous that made it: lastlie it wrought in me a desire to bee whole, and to hunger and thirst after more righteousnesse and more strength to fulfil the law more perfectlie: and in all that I doe or leaue vndone to seeke Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his will with meeknesse euermore condemning the imperfectnes of my deeds by the law.</p>
               <p>Now then this good work of God to my saluation standeth in two pointes, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the law, and the working of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: the preaching of the lawe was a key that bound and damned my conscience, the preaching of the gospell was an other key that loosed me againe. These two salues (I meane the lawe &amp; the gospell) vsed God &amp; his preacher to heale and cure mee a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched sinner withall. The lawe did driue out my disease and made it appeare, and was a sharpe salue and fretting corasiue, &amp; killed the dead flesh, and losed and drewe the sore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14870:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out by the roote, and all corruption. It pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from me all trust and confidence I had in my selfe, and in mine owne workes, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, deseruings, and ceremonies, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me of all my righteousnes, &amp; made me poore. It killed me in sending me downe to hell, and bringing mee almost to vtter des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, &amp; prepared the way of the Lord, as it is written of <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> For it was not possible that Christ should come vnto mee as long as I trusted in my selfe or in any worldly thing, or had anie righteousnes of mine owne, or riches of holie workes. Then afterwarde came the Gospell a more gentle plaister, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oupled and swaged my wounds of my conscience and brought me health: It brought the spirit of God, which loosed the bandes of Sathan, and coupled me to God &amp; his wil through a strong faith &amp; ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue. Which bands were to strong for the Diuell, the world, or anie creature to loose. And I a poore &amp; wretched sinner felt so great mercie that in my selfe I was most sure that God would not forsake mee, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer withdrawe his mercie and loue from mee,.

more liuelie feeling of my weaknes, &amp; with a more bitter detestation of my sinne. By nature through the fall of Adam am I the childe of wrath, heire of the vengeance of God by birth: yea and so from my first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: And I had my fellowshippe with the damned diuels vnder the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and rule of Sathan, while I was yet in my mothers womb: and although I show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the fruites of sinne as soone as I was born nor lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after: yet was I full of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall poyson, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence all wicked deeds do spring, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but sin outwardly, as soone as I am able to work (be I neuer so yong) if occasion be giuen: for my nature is to sinne as is the nature of a serpent to sting: and as a Serpent yet young, or yet vnbrought foorth is full of poyson and cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde (when time and occasion is giuen,) but bring forth the fruites thereof. And as an Adder, a Toad, or a Snake is hated of man, not for the euill it hath done, but for the poyson that is in it, and hurt which it cannot but doe: so am I hated of God, for that naturall poyson which is concieued and borne with mee before I doe anie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde euill.

               <p>That which may doe good vnto other men I will neuer conceale though it be to my perpetuall shame. As I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued &amp; born in sin, so my Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts brought me vp in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; neuer shewed me my shame and miserie by Gods law: &amp; I liued a long time, euen as a man in a dead sleepe or trance, and in truth I liued as though there were neither heauen nor hell, neither God nor Diuel. And the Diuel himself (as now I perceiue) did often perswade my secure conscience that I was the child of God, and shoulde be saued as well as the best man in the world: and I yeelded to this perswasion, and did verilie thinke it: so that when the preacher for wickednesse and securitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Gods iudgementes and hell fire, I haue saide vnto my neighbours that I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped I should be saued, and he should goe to hell: and when I was asked whether I could keepe all the commandements of the lawe I saide that I coulde, and being asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I neuer sinned: I saide I thought that otherwhiles I did, marrie for them which were but fewe, I hoped God woulde haue mercie, and haue me excused. And all my
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14870:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neighbors were glad of my company, they spoke well of me, and I was taken for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, when as indeed, before God I was a vile beast, &amp; the childe of wrath, inspired with the spirite of the Diuell continuallie. Well; afterward I heard the law preached and I sawe and remembred manie fearefull iudgements of GOD vpon men whom I in reason thought were as good men as I, then I beganne to consider mine owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and to perceiue my sinnes, and my cursednesse, and vpon a time aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the curse of the lawe made mee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie afraide, and my flesh then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to tremble and quake: then I could not sleepe in the night season, I was afraide of euerie thing. If I were in my house, I thought the house would fall on my head; if abroade, I thought euerie crannie of the earth would open it selfe wider and swallow me. I started at euerie strawe, and at the moouing of a flie: my meate was lothsome vnto me, and I thought I was not worthie of so good a creature of God, and that God might iustlie turne it to my bane: the greefe of my heart for my life past made me shed abundance of tears: and vpon that I remembred (that I had heard read in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14870:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church, in Dauids Psalmes, that his teares were his drinke, and that hee did wette his bed with teares. And now the Deuill chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both his coate and his note, &amp; in feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner cryed in my eares, that I was a reprobate, his childe: that none of Gods children were as I am, that this griefe of my soule was the beginning of hell. And the greater was my paine, because I durst not open my minde vnto anie for feare they shoulde haue mocked mee, and haue made a iest of it. Wherefore I was fayne to go to a godlie learned Preacher: I shewed myne estate vnto him? after I had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him the space of two or three daies. I receiued comfort both by the promises of mercie, which hee shewed mee in the booke of God, and by his feruent godlie and effectuall prayers: and I thanke God euer since I haue had some assurance (in spite of the Deuill) that I doe apperteine to the kingdome of heauen, and am nowe a member of Iesus Christ, and shall so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for euer.</p>

               <speaker>Euseb.</speaker>
               <p>According as God hath giuen me to feele the same so will I shewe it you. And first of all the dealing of God towards me is a good argument to mee. In the first commandement, God hath commaunded me to take him to bee my God, and in the Lords praier he teacheth me to call him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he hath created the world generallie and euerie creature particularlie for man &amp; so for me, to serue for my commoditie, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and admonition. Also he hath made me after his owne image, hauing a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule, body, shape, where he might haue made me a Toad, a Serpent, a Swine, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, frantick. Moreouer, he hath wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie preserued me in my infancie, childhood, youth, middle age hitherto from manifold da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers &amp; perils: all which do confirm in me a perswasion of Gods fatherlie loue: &amp; that I should not doubt hereof: where I might haue beene borne of Turks, lo it was the wil of God that I should be borne of Christian Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; be brought into Gods Church by Baptisme, which is the Sacrament of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; requireth faith, as wel of the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my sins as of sanctification and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to bee wrought of God in mee by his grace and holie spirite: where I might haue
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14870:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been borne in an ignorant time and region, God would that I shoulde be borne in these daies and in this countrie where is more knowledge reuealed then euer was here or in manie places els is. Where I might haue beene of a corrupt iudgement &amp; entangled with manie errours of Papistrie, &amp; of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of loue, &amp; of that hypocritical Brown, by Gods goodnes my iudgement is refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and he hath lightened mine eies to see &amp; my heart to imbrace his sincere truth. By all which things I doe confirme my faith of this that God alwaies hath beene, is, and wil be for euer my father, &amp; at my departing forth of this world will giue me the crowne of euerlasting glorie. Secondlie when as man is euermore doubting of the promises of God be they neuer so certain, God of his infinite mercie to preuent all occasions of doubting, promiseth to giue his owne spirit as a pledge, pawne, or earnest pennie vnto his children of their adoption &amp; election to saluation. Now since it pleased God to call me from hypocrisie to bee a member of his Church, I feel that in my self which I neuer felt or heard of before. In times past, I came to praiers and to the preaching of Gods word euen as a Beare commeth to the stake,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14870:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now the word of God is meate and drinke to me, and praier is no burden vnto me, but my ordinarie exercise. If I rise in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I am not well till I haue praied and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thankes to God, if I doe any thing it commeth into my minde to pray. In my praiers I finde great ioy and comforte and the exceeding fauour of God, I neuer think I can well take my rest, or doe anie thing else except first I aske it at Gods hande in Christ. Lastlie, when my minde and heart is whollie occupied in worldlie matters, I am stirred vp, and as it were drawne to pray vnto God for the remission of my sinnes, and the assurance of my saluation, and in praier I haue had those grones which for their greatnes cannot bee expressed. Nowe from whence commeth all this? From the Diuell? No. In these actions I haue found him my enemie, and a continuall hinderer of them. For he by his craft when I haue beene heauie and weake, hath assailed to prouoke me to some sinnes whereunto my cursed nature was most giuen. and I hauing yeelded to him, haue beene so hardened and blinded by those sinnes, that for a time I haue made light account of the worde of God and praier. Well then, peraduenture
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14870:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this came from mine owne selfe? No nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This cursed nature of mine hath beene more pleased and delighted with sinne, and with the pleasures of the world, then with such exercises, from which it draweth mee &amp; presseth me down as lead. I cannot think that such a poisoning Cockatrice can laie such good egges, or that wild crabbe trees (such as all men are in Adam) can bring foorth sweete fruites according to the will of God, except God plucke them foorth of Adam, and plant them in the garden of his mercie, and stocke them, and graft the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christ in them. Wherefore these are the workes of Gods spirit, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is thereby certified that God hath giuen me the spirite of adoption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his fauour and mercie shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue towardes me for euer. For the giftes of God are without repentance, and whome God once loueth, him hee loueth for euer. Thirdlie, there bee certaine fruites of Gods children which I finde in mee, by which I am confirmed in Gods fauour. Saint Iohn in his first epistle saith, that hereby wee know that wee are translated from death to life because we loue the bretheren. Truelie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> feele in my heart a burning loue towardes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14870:80"/>
them which are good Christians though I neuer knewe them nor saw them, and I am verie desirous to doe anie good for them: and if drops of my heart bloude would doe them good they should haue them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer I hate all sinne and wickednesse with a bitter hatred, and I long to see the comming of my sauiour Christ to iudgement, I am grieued and disquieted because I cannot fulfill the law of God as I ought, all which I haue learned foorth of Gods word to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods children. And thus you see what euidence I haue to shewe that I am a true member of the Church militant and in the fauour of God.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14870:80"/>

If the spirite ouercome in tentations, then is shee stronger and the flesh weaker. But if the flesh get a custome, then is the spirit none otherwise oppressed of the flesh then as though she had a mountaine on hir backe, and as we sometime in our dreames thinke we beare heauier then a milstone on our breasts: or when we dreame nowe and then that wee would runne awaie for feare of some thing, our legges seeme heauier then leade: Euen so is the spirite oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and ouerladen of the flesh through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, that shee strugleth and striueth to gette vp and to breake loose in vaine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the God of mercie which heareth my grone through Iesus Christ come and lose hir with his power, and put something on the backe of the flesh to keepe hir downe to minish hir strength and to mortifie hir. So then no sinner I am if you regard the spirit, the profession of my heart toward the lawe of God, my repentance and sorrowe that I haue both because I haue sinned and am

yet full of sinne, &amp; looke vnto the promises of mercie in our Sauiour Christ, and vnto my faith.

And I had rather you should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande this foorth of the Scriptures, by the example of <hi>Ionas</hi> and the Apostles. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was the friende of God, and a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen seruaunt of GOD, to testifie his will vnto the worlde.

and the greatest citie of the worlde, then called <hi>Niniuie</hi> to preach that within fortie dayes they shoulde bee destroyed for their sinnes: which message the free will of Ionas had as much power to doe as the weakest hearted woman in the worlde had power, if shee were commaunded to leape into a tubbe of liuing snakes and Adders: as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelie if God had commanded Sara to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice hir sonne Isaac, as he did Abraham, she would haue disputed with God ere shee had done it, or though shee were strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Well Ionas hartned by his owne imagination, and reasoning after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; I am here a prophet vnto Gods people the Israelits: which though they haue gods worde testified vnto them daylie, yet des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise and worshippe God vnder the likenesse of Calues &amp; after all maner of fashions saue after his owne worde, and therefore are of all nations the worst and most worthie of punishment. And yet God for loue of a few that are among them, &amp; for his names sake spareth and defendeth them: how then shal God take so cruel vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on so great a multitude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his name was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preached, &amp; therefore are not the tenth part so euill as these.

preach, I shal lie &amp; shame my selfe, and God too, &amp; make them the more to despise God. Vpon this imagination hee fledde from the presence of GOD, and from the countrie where God is worshipped. When Ionas entred into the ship, he laide him downe to sleepe: for his conscience was tossed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the commandement of God which sent him to Niniuie, and his fleshlie wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which disswaded and counselled him to the contrarie, &amp; at last preuayled against the commaundement, and carried him an otherway as a shippe caught betweene two streames as the Poets faine the mother of <hi>Meleager</hi> to be betweene diuers affections? while to aduenture hir brothers death shee sought to sley hir owne sonne: wherevpon for verie payne and tediousnesse shee laye downe to sleep to put the commandement out of minde, which did so gnawe and fret hir conscience: as the nature of all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is, when they haue sinned in earnest, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

for when the lott had caught Ionas, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be sure that his sin came to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance again, &amp; that his conscience raged no lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the waters of the sea.

And then hee confessed his sinne openlie, and of verie desperation to haue liued any longer hee had cast himselfe into the Sea betimes except they woulde bee lost also, for all this God prouided a fish to swallow Ionas. When Ionas had beene in the fishes bellie a space, the rage of his conscience was somewhat quieted, and hee came to himselfe againe, and had receiued a little hope: and the qualmes and panges of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration which went ouer his heart were halfe ouercome, then hee prayed to God, and gaue thankes vnto him. When Ionas was cast vppon the lande againe then his will was free, and he had power to go whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God sent him, and to what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, his owne imagination laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: for he had ben at a new schole &amp; in a

For as far as we be blind in Adam we cannot but seeke and will our own profit, pleasure &amp; glorie: &amp; as far as we be taught in the spirit, we cannot but seeke and will the pleasure of God only. Then Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas preached to <hi>Niniuie,</hi> and they repented: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ionas shewed again his corrupt nature for all his trying in the Whales bellie.

The apostles Christ taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer to be meek &amp; to humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: yet oft they striued among themselues who should be greatest: the sons of Zebede would sit one on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand of Christ, the other on the left.

was angry and rebuked Christ, and thought earnestlie that hee had raued, and not wist what hee had said, as at another time when Christ was so feruentlie busied in healing the people, that he had no leasure to eate, they went out to holde him, supposing that hee had beene beside himselfe. And one that cast foorth Diuelles in Christes name they forbadde, because hee waited not on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so glorious were they yet. And though Christ taught alway to forgiue, yet Peter after long going to schole, asked whether men should forgiue seauen times, thinking that eight times had beene too much.

Marke this if God send thee to the sea, &amp; promise to go with thee, he wil raise vp a tempest against thee, to prooue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt abide by his word, and that thou maist feele thy faith &amp; weakenes and perceiue his goodnes: for if it were alwaies faire weather and thou neuer brought into such ieopardie, whence his mercie onlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth thee, thy faith should bee onelie a presumption, &amp; thou shouldest be euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull to God, and merciles vnto thy neighbour.

yet hee brought them foorth the space of fortie yeares into a lande where in riuers of milke and honie were, but where so much as a drop of water was not, to nurture and teach them as a father doth his sonne, and to doe them good at the latter ende, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their cankred nature, to make them strong in the spirite to vse his benefites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.

               <p>There is no bodie here but you &amp; I, and I take you to bee a Christian and a faithfull friende: therefore I will shewe a little of my exhortation. The last yeare by reason of the dearth, I and my familie were put to great pinches, and most commonly we had nothing but bread and water: here
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14870:89"/>
vpon I bethought mee howe I might get somewhat to releiue my familie: It came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my minde that in our Towne a rich man had a great flocke of sheepe, and that I might take one of them without any hurt of him. I was verie loath at the first: but because there was such great stealing of sheepe, &amp; I was in extremitie, in the night I went among his sheep and tooke a lambe, and told my familie that it was giuen me: I presently killed it, the skinne and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralles I burned on my backeside, the fleshe wee dressed by quarters, and did eate it with thanksgiuing (as my manner is) but surely verie coldlie, and mee thought my prayer was abhominable in Gods sight. After I had thus done, we fared wel for the space of two daies, but I felt my heart hardned, and my lips were almost locked vp, that I could not as I was wont praise the Lord. The third night after, I went with a quiet conscience (mee thought) to my bedde, and then I slept soundlie till three of the clocke in the morning, but I dreamed that one came to carrie me to pryson, vpon that on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den I awaked and beeing afraide looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mee and fell to consider why I should
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14870:90"/>
be afraide, and I remembred that I had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against God by robbing my neighbor: ô then my feare increased, and I thought that hell gaped to deuoure me, and the law looked vpon me with such a terrible coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, and so thundred in myne eares, that I durst not abide in my bed, but vp &amp; to goe. Then the Diuell assailed me on euerie side, to perswade that God had cast mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie: saying, they that be Gods, haue power to keepe his law, thou hast not, but brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest them: Therefore thou art a cast-awaie and a damned creature, &amp; hell gapeth and setteth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mouth to deuour thee. And I thought with my selfe that I had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a ranke hypocrite, for as the cloudes of the ayre doe couer the sunne, so that sometimes a man cannot tell by anie sense that there is anie Sun, the clouds &amp; windes hiding it from our sight: euen so my cecitie and blindnesse, and corrupt affections, and the rage of my conscience did so ouersha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the sight of Gods seed in me, and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelme his spirite as though I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and feeling, but not according to the truth, desired of God to giue him againe his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Which thing GOD neuer doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: although hee made mee to thinke so for a time: for alwaies hee holdeth his hande vnder his children in their falles, that they lie not still as other doe which are not regenerate. I being thus turmoiled and stong with the conscience of sinne and the cockatrice of my poisoned nature, hauing behelde hirselfe in the glasse of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous law of God there was no other salue or remedie but to runne to the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent Christ Iesus which shedde his blood, hanging vppon the crosse, and to his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting testament and mercifull promise, that it was shed for mee for the remission of my sinnes, therefore I got me speedilie into a close corner in my house, and there vpon my face groueling, I confessed my sinne and prayed after this manner in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Father, what an horrible monster am I? What taytor? what rascall and villaine? thy mercie is woonderfull that hell hath not deuoured me hauing deserued a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand damnations. I haue sinned, I haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against thy godly, holy &amp; righteous law
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14870:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and against my brother by robbing him, whome I ought to loue for thy sake as dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as my selfe, forgiue mee father for thy son Christ his sake according to thy most mercifull promisses and testament: forget not good Lorde thy olde mercies shewed vppon me, let them not at this time in me be quite remooued. On this manner prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I continued fiue howers, and GOD which is neere to all them that call vppon him, heard me, eased my paine, and assured mee of the remission of my sin. After pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, for the more easing of my conscience I went to my neighbour, &amp; betweene him and me vpon my knees confessed my fault with teares, desiring him to forgiue me, &amp; I woulde (as Gods lawe requireth,) restore that which I stole foure folde: he (I thanke him) was contented and toke pittie on me, and euer since hath beene by Gods mercie my good friend.

               <p>Surely I haue very great comfort by the sacrament of the Lords Supper: for whereas I am spirituallye diseased, and am prone and readye to fall, and am most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly oftentimes inuaded of the feend, the flesh, and the law, when I haue sinned: and am put to flight, and made to runne awaye from God my father: therefore hath God of all mercie and of his infinite pitty &amp; bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse compassion set vppe his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a signe vpon a hie hill, whence it may be seene on euery side far and neare to call againe them that be runne awaye. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14870:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with this sacrament he (as it were) clocketh to them, as a hen dooth for hir chickens, to gather them vnder the wings of his mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath commanded his sacrament to be had in continuall vse, to put vs in minde of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall mercy laid vp for vs in Christs blood, and to witnesse and testifie it vnto them, and to be the seale therof. For the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament dooth much more liuely print the faith, and make it sincke downe into the hart then do bare words onely. Now when the words of the testament and promises are spoken ouer the bread (this is my body that was broken for you: this is my blood that was shed for you) they confirme the faith; but much more when the sacrament is seene with the eies, and the bread broken, the wine powred out and looked on: and yet more when I taste it and smell it, As you see when a man maketh a promise vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with light words betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues &amp; so they departed, he to whom the promis is made beginneth to doubt whether the other spake earnestlye or mocked, &amp; doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth whether he will reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber his promise, to abide by it or no. But when any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with aduisement, the words are more credible: &amp; if he swear, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the thing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14870:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more and yet the more if hee strike hands, if hee giue earnest, if hee call recorde, if he giue hand-writing &amp; seale it: so is the more &amp; more beleeued, for the heart gathereth: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o, he spake with aduisement, deliberation, &amp; good sadnes, he clapped hands, called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, and put to his hande and seale: the man cannot bee so faint without the feare of God as to denie al this: shame shal make him abide his promise, though hee were such a man as I could not compel him, if he woulde denie it. And thus we dispute, God sent his sonne in our nature, and made him feele our infirmities that moue vs to sinne and named his name Iesus, that is a Sauior, because he should saue his people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their sinnes, and after his death he sent his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to preach these glad-tydings, to thrust them in at the eares of vs, and set vp a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of them to testifie them &amp; to seale them, and to thrust them in, not at the eares onely by rehearsing the promises of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament ouer it: neither at our eies onely in beholding it, but beat them in through our feeling, tasting &amp; smelling also, and to bee repeated dailie &amp; to be ministred to vs. He wold not (think we) make half so much a do with vs if he loued vs not, &amp; wold not haue

For as touching to please God there is no work better then other: God looketh not first on my works, as the world doth, or as though he had neede of them: but God looketh first on my hart what faith I haue to his word, how I beleeue him, trust him, and how I loue him, for his mercie that he hath shewed mee, hee looketh with what heart I

work, &amp; not what I work, how I accept the degree hee hath put me in, not of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree I am. Let vs take an example. You are a Minister and preach the worde, I am a kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen boy, &amp; wash my maisters dishes. Of the ministerie hark what the Apostle saith: if I preach I haue nought to reioice in, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie is put vpon mee: if I preach not the gospel, as who should saie, God hath made me so, woe is to me if I preach not. If I do it willinglie (saith he) then I haue my reward; that is, then am I sure that Gods spirite is in me, &amp; that I am elect to eternall life. If I do it against my wil, the office is committed to me, that is, if I do it not of loue to God but to get a liuing therby, &amp; for a worldlie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose &amp; had rather otherwise liue: then do I that office which God hath put vpon mee, but do not please God. So then if you prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not, or in preaching had not your hart aright you minister the office &amp; they that haue the spirit of God heare his word, yea, though it were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by an Asse, &amp; the woe belongeth to you: but &amp; if you preach wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Now I that minister in the kitchin, and am but a kitchin boy, receiue all thinges at the hand of God, knowe that God hath put me in such an office, submit my selfe to his wil, and serue my Maister, not as a man but as Christ himselfe, with a pure heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Paul teacheth me, putting my trust in God and of him seeke my reward.

               <p>But alas verie few there be that are taught &amp; feele their ingrafting into Christ, their iustification, their inwarde dying vnto sin &amp; liuing vnto righteousnes, which is the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14870:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meaning of their Baptisme. And therefore we remaine all blinde generallie, as well the great Rabbins which brag of their learning, as the poore vnlearned laie man. And the Scripture is become so darke vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they grope for the dore &amp; can find no waie in, &amp; it is become a maze vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in which they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der as in a mist or (as we saie) led by Robin goodfellow. And their darkenes can not comprehend the light of the Scriptures but they read them as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do tales of Robin hood, as riddles, or as olde priests read their Ladies mattins, which they vnderstand not. And vntil a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be taught his baptisme, that his heart feele the sweetnes of it, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are shut vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; so dark that he could not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, though Peter, Paul, or Christ himself did expound it vnto him, no more then a man starke blinde can see though thou set a candle before him, or shew him the Sun, or point with thy finger vnto that thou wouldest haue him looke vpon. As for heresie there is no danger if a man come to the Scripture with a meeke spirit seeking there to fashion himselfe like vnto Christ according to the profession and vowe of his Baptisme: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hee shall there finde the mightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of GOD to alter and chaunge him in

Again, God which commandeth me not to steale, commandeth me also to pray, and his will is, that one commandement should be as well kept as an other: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

I am perswaded that condemnation will befall me as well for the one as for the other. And that praier ought to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie euen in euerie thing a man doth, me thinketh it most agreeable to Gods will. For if I shoulde come into my neighbours house and take his goods, and vse them, not borrowing them or asking anie leaue, they would laie handes on mee, and make mee a thiefe. The world and all the thinges in the world are the Lords, not mine: so then if I shall dailie vse them, neuer seeking to the Lorde by praier for the vse of them, before God I am an vsurper, nay a ranke thief, and therfore I desire of God heartily that I may vse all his good creatures with feare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and that I may sanctifie his name in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which Paule sheweth me to be done by the worde of God and praier, the worde showing me the lawful vse of his creatures: praier obtaining at Gods hands, that I may vse them aright.

And as oft as we sin, faith only keepeth that we forsake not our profession and that loue vtterlie quench not, &amp; hope faile, &amp; onlie maketh the peace again: for a true beleeuer trusteth in Christ alone and not in his own workes nor ought else for the remission of sins. The office of loue is to powre out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the same goodnes that it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God vpon hir neighbor, to be to him as it feeleth Christ to be to it self. The office of loue is onelie to haue compassion, and to beare with hir neighbour the burden of his infirmities. 1. Pet. 4.

The office of hope is to comfort in aduersitie, and to make patient that we faint not, nor fall downe vnder the Crosse, or cast it of our backes.

               <p>No, you must vnderstand that there bee two states or regiments in the worlde: the kingdome of heauen which is the regiment of the Gospell: and the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the worlde, which is the temporall kingdome. In the first state there is neither father nor mother, neither maister, mistres, maide, nor seruant, nor husband, nor wife, nor Lord, nor subiect, nor inferior woman, but Christ is all, &amp; each to other is Christe himself, there is none better then other, but all alike good, all brethren, and Christ onlie is Lord ouer all, neither is there any other thing to doo, or other law, saue to loue one another as Christ loued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: In the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall regiment, is husband, wife, father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sonne, daughter, mistres, maide, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruant, subiect, Lord? Now euery person is a double person, and vnder two regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14870:102"/>
in the first regiment I am a person of mine owne selfe vnder Christe and his doctrine, and maye neither hate nor be angrie, and much lesse fighte or reuenge: but must after the example of Christe, humble my selfe, forsake and denie my selfe, and hate my selfe, and caste my selfe awaye, and bee meeke and patient, and let euery man goe ouer mee and treade mee vnderfoote, and doo mee wronge: and yet I am to loue them, and praye for them as Christ did for his crucifiers: for loue is all, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is not of loue, is damnable, and cast foorth of that kingdome. In the temporall regiment thou art a person in respect of an other, thou art husband, father, mother, daughter, wife, lord, subiect, and there thou must doe according to thine office. If thou be a father thou must doe the office of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and rule, or else thou damnest thy selfe: thou must bring all vnder obedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by faire meanes or by foule: thou must haue obediencc of thy wife, of thy seruants, and of thy subiects, if they will not obeye in loue, thou must chide, fight, and correct, as farre as the lawe of GOD and the lawe of the lande will suffer thee: Now to the purpose: whether a man maie
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14870:103"/>
resist violence, and defend or reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himselfe: I saie naie, in the firste state where thou art a person for thy selfe alone, and Christs disciple, there thou must loue and of loue doe, studie and enforce: yea &amp; suffer all thinges (as Christ did to make peace, that the blessing of God may come vppon thee, Which saith, blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall bee the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. If thou suffer &amp; keepe peace in thy selfe onely, thy blessing is the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of this worlde: but if thou so loue the peace of thy brother that thou leaue nothing vndoone or vnsuffered to further it, thou shalt possesse heauen. But in this worldlie state where thou art no priuate man, but a person in respect of other, thou must and art bounde vnder paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to execute thine office. Of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants thou must exact obedience, and must not suffer thy selfe to bee dispised. If thou art a ruler, thou must take, imprison, and sley to, not of malice and hate to reuenge thy selfe, but to defende thy subiectes and to maintaine thine office: the ruler must not oppresse his subiects with rentes, fines and customes, at all, neither pill them with taxes, and such like to maintaine his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14870:103"/>
owne lustes: but bee louing and kinde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as Christ was to him: for they be the price of his bloode. I will shewe my minde more plainelie by one example. You are in your fathers house among your brethren and sisters, there if one fight with another, or if anie doe you wrong, you maie not reuenge or smite, for that pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the father onelie. But if your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue you authoritie in his absence and commaunde you to smite, if they will not bee ruled but abuse you, then you are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person. Notwithstanding yet you haue not put off the first person, but are a brother still, and must euer loue and proue all thinges to rule with loue: but if loue wil not serue, then you must vse the office of an other person, or sinne against your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Euen so when you are a temporall person you put not of the spirituall: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must euer loue, but when loue will not helpe, you must with loue execute the office of the temporall person. You must loue your neighbour in your hart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is your brother in the first state, yet you must obeie your ruler who hath power ouer you, and when neede requireth at his commandement you must goe with the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14870:104"/>
constable or like officer and breake open your neighbors doore, if hee will not open it in the kings name: yea if he will not yeld in the kings name, you maie smite him to the ground till he bee subdued, and looke what harme he getteth, that be vppon his owne heade.</p>

               <p>I vnderstand you well. As I am a member of the spirituall bodie of Christ I must in all my conuersation follow him with patience, meekenes, and long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ouercomming other mens euils with weldoing: yet if the hurt be greater then I can beare, I must take a new person on me, and if I be a ruler, with loue seeke amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if a subiect, then in the feare of God, complaine to my ruler. But further I pray you soile me this doubt. If I shall be taken for a soldier, me thinks that I should then shake off all loue and meekenes, &amp; then I could not practise this Christian rule.</p>

               <p>Yes, if our Queene (God saue her grace) should send you on warfare into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other countrie, you must obeie at Gods commandement, and go and auenge your Princes quarrell, which you knowe not but that it is right. When you come thether, remember the two stats in which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14870:104"/>
you are: and knowe that in the firste state, that is, the regiment spiritual, you must loue them with whome you fight, and that they are your brethren bought with Christes blood, as well as you, and for Christes sake hate them not, yet as you are in the second state a Souldior at your Princes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, you must fight against them, and mainteine your Princes quarrell, and bring them vnder hir power: and therewithall be content with your Princes wages, neither desire your aduersaries life or goods, saue to aduantage your Prince. So then a Souldior neede not cast away meekenes, for he may fight with his enemie and slaye him, and yet loue him.</p>

                  <p>THe proposition is certaine: because, as long as any man hath his conscience to accuse him of sinne before God, hee is in state of damnation, <note n="a" place="margin">1.

                  <p>The Assumption (namely, that the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of Rome cannot pacifie the conscience) may be easily prooued on this wise.</p>

if it shall frustrate but anye one pointe of anye one commaundement, the whole commaundement, yea, the whole law ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is made in vaine. 1 The first comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement requireth, that wee haue the true <hi>Iehoua</hi> for our onely God: the church of Rome maketh other gods beside this true God: it maketh the bodie of Christ to be God, because they hold, it may be in many places, in heauen, in earth, at the same time, which thing is onely proper to God.

                  <p>Againe, the Church of Rome, maketh Marie the Mother of Iesus to be as God. In the Breuiarie reformed &amp; published at the commandement of Pius, <note n="a" place="margin">In officio par. beatae Mariae. ad matut.</note> shee is called <hi>A Goddes,</hi> in expresse words: and she is further tearmed the <hi>Queene of heauen, the Queene of the world, the gate of heauen, the mother of grace and mercie:</hi> Yea shee is farre exalted aboue Christ, and he in regarde of her is made but a poore vnderling in heauen: for Papistes in their seruice vnto her they praie on this manner saying: <hi>Shew thy selfe to bee a mother: and cause thy sonne to receiue our prayers: set free the captiues and giue light to the blinde.</hi>

the Church of Rome beside the one true God distinguished into three persons, the father, the sonne, the holy Ghost, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also manie other, and so in truthe hath repealed this first commandement.</p>
                  <p>And they haue verie plainely repealed the second commandement in that they teach it lawfull to make images of the true God, and to worship him in them. For the flat contrarie is the verie scope of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: namelie that no image must be made of the true Iehoua: nor any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be performed vnto him in an image: which appeareth thus. In Deutronomie <hi>Moyses</hi> maketh a large commentarie of this commandement, and this verie point he<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 15. 16.</note> sets downe expresselie, saying, take heed to your selues: for yee sawe no image in the day that the Lord spake vnto you in <hi>Horeb,</hi> out of the middest of the fire: that yee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt not your selues, and make you a grauen image or representation of anie figure, &amp;c. His argument I set downe thus. As God appeared in mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> so he is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and represented: but he appeared in no image in mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> onelie his voice was hard: therefore he is not to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or represented in anie image: but men
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14870:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are to bee content, if they may heare his voice. Againe, that sinne to which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israell were speciallie giuen euen that dooth the Lorde especially forbid: but to this were the people of Israell speciallie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, not so much to make Images of false Gods, as to make Images of the true God, and to worship him in them: which I proue thus.</p>
                  <p>In the booke of Iudges it is saide that<note place="margin">Iudg. 2. 11.</note> the children of Israell did wickedlye in the sight of the Lord, and serued <hi>Baalim.</hi> Now these <hi>Baalim,</hi> what are they? Surely Idoles resembling the true God, as the prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> declareth, and at that daie saith the Lord thou shalt call me <hi>Ishai,</hi> and shalt call<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 10.</note> mee no more <hi>Baali.</hi> Heere it appeareth that the Israelites meaning was not to worship a false God, but the true God in <hi>Baalim.</hi> And <hi>Aaron</hi> when he made the golden Calfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 5</note> that the next daye should be holie daie, not of anie false God but of the Lorde that brought them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esaie</hi> after that he had set foorth Gods maiestie verie worthelye, he comes in with<note place="margin">Esa. 40. 18.</note> this conclusion: To whome then will yee liken GOD? or what similitude will yee set vp of him? which declareth that the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14870:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iewes after the manner of the Gentiles, ran a whoring after Idoles, that is Images not onely of false Gods, but also of the true God. I conclude therefore as I began, that the Church of Rome, by maintaining Images, hath repealed this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Neither dooth it shewe lesse fauour to the third commaundement: which also is repealed. First in that they teach men to<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 28</note> giue the glorie which is proper to GOD, to some thing else: it is proper to GOD after the daie of Iudgement to be all in all: this they giue to Marie, saying that <hi>shee is all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is proper to Christe in respect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures to bee a light lightning all that come into the worlde, yet they praye to Marie to giue light to the blinde. It is<note place="margin">Iohn. 10. 9.</note> proper to Christe to bee the redeemer of mankinde, and this worke of redemption, is ascribed to Marie, whome Papists call their <hi>hope,</hi> their <hi>ioye,</hi> their <hi>mediatresse,</hi> a <hi>mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the diseased,</hi> a <hi>defence from the enemie,</hi> a <hi>friend in the houre of death.</hi> Againe they make Saint Martin <hi>A Priest according to the order of Melchisedecke,</hi> which is proper to Christe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:14870:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly they holde that the people is to be barred from the reading of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vnlesse it be in an vnknowne tongue, and so they mainteine ignorance and the profaning of Gods name. For the free pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the worde, and therefore also the hearing, learning, reading, searching of it, is the <hi>glorifiyng of the word,</hi> and so the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">2. Thes. 3. 1.</note> of Gods name.</p>
                  <p>The fourth commaundement is repealed in that they require that their feast daies should be kept as solemnlie as the Lords sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth<note place="margin">Con. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, c. 36. 37. Matiscan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. c. 1. 2.</note> day. For they must be kept <hi>in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and comlines:</hi> and men <hi>must rest from all their laboures, from morning to euening,</hi> as on the Sabaoth: whereas contrariwise, the Lord hath giuen permission to his seruants to labour the sixe daies, sobeit, on the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth they wil rest from the works of their callings, and do the workes of the spirit.</p>
                  <p>They repeale the fift commaundement in that they teach that their cleargie hath an immunitie, and therfore is not bound to performe obedience to Magistrates, for so<note place="margin">Matisc. Concil. ca. 7. 9. 8</note> they haue decreed, that <hi>Clarkes are to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged onely of Bishops:</hi> and that they are onely to reskue them from iniuries. Againe that the Bishop must not bee iudged of the secular
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14870:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power: and that the Pope himselfe oweth no subiection to Kings, Princes, Emperors, but hath power to make them, and to put them downe at his pleasure. But S. Paule for the maintening of the fift commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bids euery soule be subiect to the hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her powers: and therefore the pope with his cleargie (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath expounded it) must be subiect to ciuill Magistrates, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they wil exclude themselues out of the number of men, for <hi>Paul</hi> speakes to all.</p>
                  <p>Against the sixte commandement they<note place="margin">Matisc. 2. ca. 8.</note> haue decreed asyles for murderers, plainly permitting them which feare authoritie to haue safetie in the lap of their mother the Church. Thus they annihillat Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, yea and more then this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tends all that they teach but the very murthering of soules?

                     </gap>ealed diuerse waies. First in that they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14870:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
maintaine the occasions of adulterie and fornication: namelie, the vowe of single life both in men and women, when as they haue not receiued the gift from God to be continent: which gift when they want, &amp; yet are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to single life, they must needs breake out into much loosenesse. This sin<note place="margin">Elog. 5. Lib. 4. 5. 9.</note> made <hi>Mantuan, Palingenius,</hi> and <hi>Petrarch</hi> to crie out against the Church of Rome. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine some Papistes defende the tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Stewes in Rome, for the auoiding of greater euils. And in the Councell of Trent chastitie and Priestes marriage are<note place="margin">Sect. 24. c. 9</note> made opposite, so that marriage with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a filthie thing, although God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it for the auoiding of fornication in all. Furthermore that which is most abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and proues the Church of Rome to be an Antichristian Church: they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine marriages within the degrees forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den both by the law of nature, and of gods word. For in the table of consanguinitie they which are placed in the transuerse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall line cannot marrie, because they are as Parents and children: yet if they bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant foure degrees on diuers sids from the common stocke they may marrie together by the Cannon lawe. As for example,

To go further, by gods word they which are dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t 4. degrees in the transuerse equall line may marrie together, as Cosin germanes. Thus the daughters of Zelophehad were married<note place="margin">Numb. 36. 11.</note> to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They repeale the eight commandement by their spirituall Marchandize in which they sell those things which are not to bee solde, as Crosses to deade men, images, praiers, the sound of belles, remission of sinnes and the merites by which men maie come to the kingdome of heauen: their shaueling Priests will do no duetie without they be feed with monie, hence comes the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

one with an other, &amp; therefore one may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for an other. Heereby it is plaine, that the Church of Rome most of all defendeth that imputation of righteousnesse, which most of all it hath oppugned. For when one man satisfieth for an other, the worke of one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is imputed to another. But what? shall one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> satisfie for an other, &amp; shal not Christ by his righteousnes satisfie for vs? shall God accept the worke of one man for an other, &amp; not acept the righteousnes of Christ for vs: Truely there is greater fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and coniunction betweene the head and the members, than of the members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues: because they are ioyned together by meanes of the head.</p>
                  <p>3 It holdeth that the guilt &amp; fault of sin may be remitted by Christ: &amp; yet the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment of sinne be vnremitted: but these are quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, there<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus.

And this agreeth not with gods iustice, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fault is quite pardoned, and a man is guiltie of no sinne, that then anie punishment should be laide<note place="margin">August. de verb. Dom Ser. 37.</note> on him. And S. Augustine saith, that Christ by taking vpon him the punishment of sin, and not taking vpon him the fault, tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie both the punishment and the fault. Wherefore this opinion, that Christ hath taken awaie the guilt of sinne, ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth al Satisfactions &amp; Purgatorie, bicause the fault and guilt being taken away, all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinne is also taken away.</p>
                  <p>4 Transubstantiation is a monster stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on manifolde contradictions. First, it maketh Christes bodie to bee in manie places: an euident contradiction. For it is of the nature and essence of a bodie to be in one place only: which I proue thus. A bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is a magnitude, a magnitude is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued quantitie, a continued quantitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but in one place: therefore a bodie cannot be but in one place. In this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the doubt is only of the last part: which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted is most true. For it is called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued quantitie, because his parts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14870:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and knit together the one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a common terme or bond, as a line by a point, a plane and his parts by a line, a solide by a superficies or plane. Now, these points ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in no wise be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, vnles eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> keepe one only special place. For examples sake: supose the plane <hi>a, b, c, d,</hi> to be deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 3. partes, l, k, l, by two lines, e, g, f, h, which doe both deuide the three partes &amp; continue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one with the <figure/> other. Now I saie, that euerie one of the parts maie be continued with his next fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it is necessarie, that euerie one of them should haue one special and distinct place. That the first place of the plane, I, maie be continued with, k, it must be situated only there where it is, and no where els: for if it shall be situate elswhere, as in the place m, then it cannot be continued with k. Nowe then, if the partes must of necessitie haue their owne particular place onely, then the whole figure a, b, c, d, must also be onely in one place. And this is that which the prince
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14870:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Philosophers teacheth, that euerie mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude hath his partes sited in some one place, one by an other, so that a man maie<note place="margin">Arist. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teg. cap. de quant.</note> saie of them, here it is, &amp; there it is not. To conclude, therefore this must need, agree to a bodie and to the parts of it to be in one onely place alone. So that the Church of Rome when it saith that Christs bodie is in many places: in effect they say, that Christs bodie is no bodie: for if it be a body, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one place: &amp; if it be in many places, it is no bodie. They obiect that God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent. True indeede: but there bee some things, the doing of which agreth not with gods power, as to make <hi>contradicentia</hi> things contradictorie to bee both true: of which sort these are. For, that Christes bodie is a true bodie, and that it is in manie places at once, are flat contrarie: because (as hath ben shewed) it is essentiall to all magnituds to be in one place, and therefore to a bodie. And God cannot take away that which is essentiall to a thing, the essence remaining whole. 2. Again, transubstantiation maketh the Accidents of Breade and Wine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine without the substance. Here also is another contradiction as impossible as the former: for it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon saying in scholes,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14870:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Accidentis esse, est inesse.</hi> It is of the essence of an accident to be in the substance. Nowe therefore, if the accidents bee, there is also the Bread and Wine: and if there be no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Bread or Wine, neither can there be anie accidents. 3. It holdeth, that Bread is turned into the bodie of Christ, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs holde, that Christs body is made of Bakers bread, and yet it holdeth and teacheth that Christes bodie is onelie made of the seed of Mary, quite ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former Transubstantiation.</p>
                  <p>5 It teacheth, that a man must alwaies doubt of his saluation: and likwise it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in praying we are to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are things quite contrarie. For who can truely call God Father, vnlesse he haue the spirite of adoption, and be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee is the childe of God. For if a<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> man shall call God Father, and yet in his heart doubt whether hee bee his Father or not, he plaieth the dissembling hypocrite: wherefore, to doubt of saluation, and to say<note place="margin">Can.

                  <p>6 The Church of Rome maketh praier to be one of the chiefe means to satisfie for sinnes. But praier indeede is an asking of pardon for sinne: Now asking of pardon
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14870:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and satisfaction for sinne are contrary: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the iudgement of the Papists, praier which is a satisfaction is no satisfaction. And in deed, let vs consider what madnesse is conteined in this popish diuinitie: the poore begger commeth very hungry to the rich mans doore to craue his almes: and straightwaies by his begging he will merit and deserue it. The same dooth the Papist, he praieth very poorely for the thing which he wanteth, yet he looketh very proudly to merite no lesse than the kindome of heauen by it.</p>
                  <p>7 Doubting of saluation and hope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> agree together, for hope maketh a man <hi>not to be ashamed,</hi> that is, it neuer disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him of the thing which he looketh for. <hi>And therefore it is called the anchor of the soule</hi>

                  <p>8 True praier and iustification by works cannot stand together. For he which prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth truely must be touched inwardlie with a liuely feeling of his owne miserie, and of the want of that grace, whereof he stands in need. Now this cannot be in the heart of

               <p>Good Zacharie waited longer on the Lord, before he granted his request, then euer you did, Its like hee praied for a child in his yonger yeres, yet his praier was not heard before he was old. And further<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 7. 13</note> you must note, that the Lord may heare the praiers of his seruants, and yet they bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of it: For the manner that God vseth in graunting their requests is not alwaies knowen: as maie appeare in the example of our Sauiour Christ. <hi>Who in the daies of his flesh, did offer vp praiers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications with strong crying and teares, vnto him</hi>

                  <hi>that was able to saue him from death, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so heard in that which he feared.</hi> And yet wee knowe hee was not freed from that cursed death, but must needes suffer it. How then was he heard? On this manner; hee was strengthened to beare the death: he had an Angell to comfort him, hee was afterward freed from the sorrowes of death. And so
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14870:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is with the rest of Christes bodie, as it was with the head. Some being in want pray for temporall blessings: God keepes them in this want, and yet hee heares their praiers, in giuing them patience and strength to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that want. Some being in wealth and aboundance praie for the continuing of it, if it be the will of God. The Lorde dinges them into a perpetuall miserie, and yet hee heares their praiers, by giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the life to come. You praie for the encrease of faith and repentance, and such like graces: you feele no increase after long praier: yet the mercifull God hath no doubt heard your praier, in that by delaying to performe your request, he hath stirred vp in you the spirite of praier, hee hath humbled you and made you feele your owne wants, the better to depend on his mercie, for the beginning and encreasing of euerie spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace.</p>

               <p>Oh Lorde God and deere Father, what shall I saie that feele all thinges to bee (in manner) with me as in the wicked? Blind is my minde, crooked is my will, and peruerse concupiscence is in me, as a spring of stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king puddle. O howe faint is faith in mee? how little is my loue to thee or thy people? how great is my selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loue? how hard is my heart? by reason whereof I am mooued to doubt of thy goodnes towards me, whether
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14870:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou art my mercifull father, and whether I be thy childe or no, indeed worthilie might I doubt, if that the hauing of these were the cause, and not the fruit rather of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The cause why thou art my father, is thy mercifull goodnes grace and truth in Christ Iesus, which cannot but remaine for euer. In respect whereof thou hast borne mee this good will to bring mee into thy Church by Baptisme and to accept me into the number of thy children, that I might be holie, faithfull, obedient and innocent: and to call me diuers times by the ministerie of thy word into thy kingdome: besides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other benefites alwaies hitherto powred vpon me. All which thou hast done of this thy good will which thou of thine owne mercie barest to me in Christ before the world was made. The which thing as thou requirest straitlie that I shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without doubting, so wouldest thou that I in all my deedes shoulde come vnto thee as to a father, and make my mone without mistrust of being heard in thy good time, as most shall make to my comfort. Lo therefore to thee deere father I come through thy sonne our Lorde, our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Aduocate Iesus Christ, who sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

on thy right hand making intercession for mee; I praie thee of thy great goodnes and mercie in Christ to be mercifull to mee a sinner, that I maie indeede feele thy sweet mercie as thy childe: the time (oh deere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) I appoint not, but I praie thee that I maie with hope still expect and looke for thy helpe. I hope that as for a little while thou hast left me, so thou wilt come and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site me, &amp; that in thy great mercie, wherof I haue great need by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Thou art wont for a little season in thine anger, to hide thy face from them whome thou louest: but surelie (O Redeemer) in eternall mercies thou wilt shewe thy compassions. For when thou leauest vs, Oh Lord, thou doest not leaue vs very long, neither doest thou leaue vs to our losse, but to our lucre and aduantage: euen that thy holie spirite with bigger portion of thy power and vertue maie lighten and cheere vs: that the want of feeling of our sorrowe maie be recompenced plentifullie with the liuelie sent of hauing thee to our eternall ioie: and therefore thou swearest that in thine euerlasting mercie thou wilt haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on vs, Of which thing, to the ende wee might be most assured, thine oath is to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14870:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be marked, for thou saiest: as I haue sworn, that I will neuer bring anie more the waters to drowne the worlde: so haue I sworne that I will neuer more be angrie with thee, nor reproue thee. The mountaines shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue, and the hilles shall fall downe, but thy louing kindnes shal not mooue, and the bond of thy peace shall not faile thee: thus saiest thou the Lorde our mercifull Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Deere father therefore, I praie thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member euen for thine owne truth &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies sake the promise and euerlasting coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which in thy good time I praie thee to write in my heart, that I maie know thee to bee the onelie true GOD, and Iesus Christ whome thou hast sent: that I maie loue thee with all my heart for euer: that I maie loue thy people for thy sake: that I maie bee holie in thy sight through Christ: that I maie alwaies not onelie striue against sinne, but also ouercome the same dailie more and more as thy children doe: aboue all things desiring the sanctification of thy name, the comming of thy kingdome, the doing of thy will on earth as it is in heauen, &amp;c. through Iesus Christ our Redeemer, Mediatour, and Aduocate, Amen.</p>
