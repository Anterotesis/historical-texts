         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of a booke in Latine, written by a graue writer, called <hi>Emanuell Meteranus</hi>: who wrote fifteene bookes <hi>de Historia Belgica.</hi> I found ſo great profunditie in the man and matter, chieflie becauſe hee exactlie (without adulation) wrote of martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and exployts done by mightie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours and valiant ſouldiers: that not onlie attained honour in the field (ſome of them honourablie borne) but alſo wanne euerlaſting fame by their proweſſe and ſeruice.

They were no ſooner entred but the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and Noblemen welcomed (with embracings) the Leader and all his followers, promiſing great matter for their boldnes.

The Prince and great Earles before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, pitying the great ſlaughter that might follow this bold attempt, on horſebacke (as all the Nobilitie were) the Prince preſented peace to the Proteſtants: who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining his offer cried kill him, and ſo bent their pikes on him.

The enemie then amazed at that ſight (beſides regarding the priuie ſtratagem or practiſes at their backes neere the riuers ſide) began after their muſing and amaze to diſcourage themſelues, in ſo much that the Cannons they would haue ſhot off, and the ſeruice they intended was vtterly forgotten, ſo that ſuddenly they let fall their pikes, and at the Proteſtants approch then at hand, the enemies cried (to ſaue their owne liues) <hi>Viue le gueulx</hi> aloude, and in ſuch ſort that they ſuffered all their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

and Leaders to the number of ſixe ſcore to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, loſing all their Cannons and Munition, putting euery thing they had into the Leaders hands of the Proteſtants, he vſing victorie in the great aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that ſeaſon, cauſed all their Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons to be drawne with ropes from the Market place to the Méere brugge, a great ſtréete néere the Burſe, and filling euery window full of ſhot to flanke each part and corner of the ſtréetes and Burſe, he chained carts together with ſhot in them, and thereon pitched ſtraight waies a Campe full vpon the Méere-brugge, hauing then at commaund thirtie thouſand reſolute ſouldiers, for the ſpace of thrée daies and nights: all which time the Generall appointed Captaines and officers for euery companie, and all warlike orders ſet in ſtay, he thought all had been well and in ſuretie: but a vile cunning and vnchriſtian brute was raiſed, that the Caluiniſts would cut the Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts throtes: on which falſe brute, in one night the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants loſt much more than ten thouſand men, who ioyned as they might with the Papiſts: yet God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the mindes of good men, made the Proteſtants and their Generall couragiouſly to plucke vp their hearts, and the Generall with fiue hundred ſhot, match fired in cocke, marched to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his preſence, and told him that this drift of the Martiniſts going from the Proteſtants, ſmelled of two much ſuttle ſmoke, the ſmoother thereof might ſet all <hi>Antwerpe</hi> on a flaming fire, deſiring him to ſee a quicke redreſſe herein, or elſe preſently the Proteſtants would giue all the enemies a battell, to the whole ſpoyle and ouerthrow of the towne: and therewithall he departed from the Prince, and vſed his fiue hundred ſhot, to houſe and driue in all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſts into their lodgings: for as yet they had not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the enemies force, they were ſo wearie with watching before, and ſo glad of reſt, libertie, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their wiues and friends at that preſent.</p>

ſent word to the Proteſtants that they ſhould haue free acceſſe to Sermons and preachings, which they ſought, (for the which was a goodly preaching place built) and further the Prince promiſed that the Martiniſes and all other enemies ſhould lay downe their weapons and paſſe quietly euery man to his lodging, requiring that the Proteſtants would make no further ſtirre, but as quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as were poſſible to march by euery mans owne doore, and there to leaue the townes men in their dwelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they marched: which requeſt of the Prince was to Gods glorie and his honour in perfit order perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, alwaies the Proteſtants kept them ſtrong till the enemie were all lodged, and then each man went home in peace.

The matter marſhally a long while pleaded and orderly by Marſhall law diſputed, the enchaunted men were all condemned to be hanged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe againſt the law of Armes they had vſed vnchriſtian and vnlawfull meanes to murther men and ſhed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian blood. Theſe men executed the Princes armie (after a good ſumme of money paied for the raunſome of <hi>Aix</hi> the great towne) departed towards <hi>Senttro,</hi> another walled towne, which redéemed it ſelfe in like manner. All this while the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> with thirtie thouſand ſhot and foure thouſand horſe, waited on the Princes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,

ſtill ſkirmiſhing with braue ſouldiers againſt the Princes forces. But almoſt forgotten at the entring of the Princes armie, he bruted that he would paſſe thorow <hi>Liege,</hi> a marueilous mightie towne, where the Duke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed by eſpiall, attended the Prince his comming: ſuddenly without ſound of Drumme the Prince parted a contrarie way towards a foord on the Maze néere <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricke,</hi> marching all the whole darke night very faſt, (which loſt ſome men) and at breake of day came to a bare Village where the foord was, to enter into <hi>Flanders:</hi> ſo in all haſte poſſible the horſemen paſſed, bearing a croope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them each one a ſouldier: but the horſes ſo many, and their legges holding vp the water, the riuer roſe ſo hie that many footmen were drowned, and much victuall wet and loſt: yet before night all the armie left aliue were landed in as great ſafetie as could be wiſhed. But reſting thrée daies there, the Duke was in <hi>Maſtrick</hi> (not very farre off) to giue the Prince battell: ſo God ſent a moſt faire day for that cauſe, in his gracious pleaſure. The Prince ranged and ſet in battell, marched on a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plaine towards <hi>Maſtrick,</hi> and the order of the field by excellent ſouldiers ſet and ranged in the moſt princelieſt manner that might be (<hi>Churchyard</hi> at all this): The vangard, battell and reregard ſo ſhining in armour, and other awfull troupes of horſemen, which ſeemed a great wood and terror to behold, that in very deede the ſhow and fight thereof would haue delighted any man liuing to behold: for the march and order of the field was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to conſider on, and moſt fearfull to match withall and encounter. Yet the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> (a great noble ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier) determined (as it was thought) valiantly to fight with all this braue armie, ſo in ſhort time the very ſame day the Prince came within ſhot of Cannon (and at the length of Muſket) ſo néere the Duke, that he ſent a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horſemen to make a brauado, and plied it ſo faſt with ſmall ſhot out of the trenches (for he was intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) that it was thought a great ſlaughter would enſue.</p>

For ſome had falſified their faith, beſides odde trumperies they deuiſed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome poyſoned the ſtanding waters and pooles: yea and in ſome places milke and drinke was infected, Milles were all broken downe, and no corne to be grinded: by which Heathenlike &amp; foule helliſh practiſes, the Princes armie was like to periſh: yet a ſhift was found to bring the armie by little &amp; little from theſe miſeries: but forced to ſkirmiſh with <hi>Alua</hi> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Prince came cunningly to a towne called <hi>Tongre,</hi> finding there much of the Dukes prouiſion, and a number of waggons full of corne and other neceſſaries, ſuccoured and made ſomewhat in ſtrength, and in hope of good fortune: the armie meant to paſſe ouer a little riuer néere <hi>Tielmount,</hi> but by the way were ſharply encountred with the whole power of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> where in hazard the Count <hi>de Hoſtraet</hi> was ſhot in the legge, of which wound he died andn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Duke likewiſe (a politike ſouldier and great gouernour) bearded the Prince a while with hot and cruell countenance, and ſo ſent <hi>Iulian Romero</hi> to lie in ambuſh betwéene a bridge and paſſage, full in the face of the Princes Campe, marching to paſſe the water: which <hi>Romero</hi> moſt like a rare great ſouldier, in a fine warlike ſort, couched his force flat on the earth behinde the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hope, ſent from the Prince to view and make place for his armies paſſage: <hi>Romero</hi> came before as one that knew the aduantage of time, couching cloſe as flat as they might, and ſo the day conſuming, all was in reſt, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6025:14"/>
both parties in a great wood lay as cloſe as they could. The Duke maintaining ſkirmiſh, followed ſtill after the Réergard of the Prince. <hi>Romero</hi> ſuffered both the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, Vaungard and Battell to paſſe the bridge: and as the Reergard aduaunced themſelues to march ouer the paſſage, <hi>Romero</hi> deſcried his power of ſixe thouſand ſhot, and ſo put al the Forlorne hope to flight, or ſlew the moſt of them. A noble Frenchman called <hi>Monſieur de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and all his companie of foure thouſand braue ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were there defeated, with others to the number of eight thouſand men: which fight and ſlaughter endured in great and bloodie broyle till the very night approched, and compelled both the Camps to lodge within Cannon ſhot one of another, and in the night the Duke priuily ſtole away, for ſome hidden cauſe and policie: for the next morning <hi>Monſieur Ianlis</hi> and ſeuen thouſand footemen, with fiftéene hundred horſe, marched ful vpon the Dukes power in a faire plaine néere vnto <hi>Namur.</hi> The Duke dreading <hi>Ianlis</hi> boldnes (and the Princes Camp not farre off) turned him backe another way, and made his march very faſt, for feare of a blow: then <hi>Ianlis</hi> and all his noble troupe ioyned with great ioy with the Princes power. Immediatly the Prince prepared to beſiege a towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chaſteau Cambreſi,</hi> and marching thitherwards, the Duke waited at hand, but the towne was ſtrongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged: notwithſtanding the Duke (as the Prince had intelligence) minded to diſturbe him: the eſpials of the Dukes Campe were by the Prince taken, which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in what diſorder the Dukes Campe lay: whereon without ſound of Drumme (moſt ſecretly) the Prince marched to méete the Duke, and the barking of dogs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ruitters waggons, gaue warning how both the armies were almoſt mingled together (the night being dark) whereat a great alarme aroſe on both ſides: but the Dukes Campe within two houres was intrenched, and ſo a great encounter of horſemen a long time paſſed out the morning in ſkirmiſhing, with many ſlaine and hurt.

The Prince then departing from <hi>Flaunders</hi> came into <hi>France</hi> néere <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>S.

               <p>WEdneſday the 17. of Aprill 1589. they embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at <hi>Plimmouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſday the 23. of Aprill they fell with the Coaſt of <hi>Galizia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſday the 24. of Aprill they landed at a little Hermitage Eaſt ſide of the <hi>Corunna</hi> or <hi>Groyne,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 12000. ſtrong. From thence to <hi>Andyas,</hi> where they had a ſmall ſkirmiſh with no loſſe to the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The 25. of Aprill being Thurſday, our men waſted and burned in the countrey what they could with fire and ſword.</p>
               <p>Saturday the 27. of Aprill they aſſaulted the baſe Towne of the <hi>Corunna</hi> and wonne it, with ſmall loſſe to them: and the Enemie retired into the high Towne, not aboue ſeuen Enſignes ſtrong as was thought.</p>
               <p>Sunday the 28. of Aprill they ſo battered a great Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaz (wherein <hi>Ricaldo</hi> ſerued the laſt yéere 1588. as Viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admirall of that Nauie ſent into <hi>England</hi>) that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards now not able to kéepe her, diſcharged her Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, fired her, and ranne her on ground, with no hurt to vs at all.</p>
               <p>The ſame day they went from <hi>Andyas</hi> to the baſe Towne of the <hi>Corunna,</hi> where they found much Béefe, Salt, Meale, Wheate, Oyle, Fiſh and Wines as was thought to victuall 40000. men a quarter of a yéere: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Gables, Hempe, Roſen, Waxe, Pitch, Tallow, and other things for ſhipping ſtore: which was leuied for a new force to haue come into <hi>England</hi> this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But in fourtéene daies there was hardly one bit of bread, wine or other victuals to be had in any quarter of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6025:64"/>
the Towne, except by ſome priuate officer or Captaine.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Enemie lying not farre off thence, preſented a Brauado before the Towne gates: againſt whom when our men ſallied foorth, without more adoe or any encounter they fled, and twelue of them were ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Monday the 29. of Aprill our men ſummoned the high Towne, who refuſed all parley. There all the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards that our men could gather (after they had taken them) they ſlew, to the great amazing of the Enemie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ſame.</p>
               <p>That night the Spaniards deſired parley, and not long after fired certaine houſes néere their vpper towne walles.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday the firſt of May 1589. our Engliſh laid their battery vnto <hi>la Corunna</hi> the great, where through the weakenes of the Rampier betwéene our great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denance and the Enemie (which fell downe with oft ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) they were driuen from their péeces by the enemies Muſquet ſhot from the towne wall. There was ſlaine Captaine <hi>Spencer,</hi> and ſome few others, and Captaine <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſhot through the face. The ſame day (in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley time) a Spaniard ſhot at an Engliſhman, and was hanged therefore by the Enemie: In this parley the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie deſired to haue faire warres with vs.</p>
               <p>Saturday the fourth of May they made a breach in the Weſt ſide of the <hi>Corunna,</hi> foure of our men making an aſſault retired againe without hurt. The ſame day Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Young</hi> being dangerouſly ſhot died ſoone after.</p>
               <p>Sunday the fift of May they aſſaulted the breach, filled vp by the Enemie, to the hurt of ſome of our armed men. Two Captaines ſhot thorow, and Captaine <hi>Brey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> hurt, Captaine <hi>Sydenham</hi> ſlaine, and one <hi>Cuckfoot</hi> an Enſigne to Sir <hi>Francis Drake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monday the ſixt of May <hi>Iohn Kempſton</hi> Marſhall of the Ordenance was ſlaine with a ſhot from the high Tower.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:6025:65"/>Tueſday the 7. of May we marched foorth nine Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon the Enemie, which had encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at a towne called <hi>Faro,</hi> foure Engliſh miles from the <hi>Corunna,</hi> our men charged on them being eight thouſand, and tooke their bridge there. On either ſide the bridge our men entred the water, draue them away, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome Colonels, wanne their Towne, victuals and prouiſions, fired the reſt of their Villages néere, draue them to retreite, purſued them in chaſe thrée miles or more, and ſlew of them in all thrée hundred at leaſt: of vs Captaine <hi>Cooper</hi> was ſlaine, and not aboue thrée moe. There were only hurt of our chiefe Commanders Sir <hi>Edward Norice,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Hender,</hi> who recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both thereof, and Captaine <hi>Fulford</hi> who died there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Of thoſe Spaniards at <hi>Faro</hi> was chiefe <hi>Don Iuan Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checo</hi> Marques <hi>de Guaſto,</hi> and Gouernour of all <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia,</hi> who fled on horſebacke with the formoſt.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday the 8. of May our Sailers went on ſhore, ranged the countrie, burned and ſpoiled aboue fiue miles, returning with ſome victuall and pillage, without any reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The ſame night the <hi>Non per illa</hi> was fired about fiue of the clocke by negligence in the harbour of <hi>Corunna,</hi> and about twelue of the clocke that night the <hi>Merchant Royall</hi> was fired, ſixe men blowne vp with powder, and ſome few hurt beſides, without more harme, praiſed be God.</p>
               <p>Thurſday the 9. of May we raiſed our ſiege from the <hi>Corunna,</hi> fired ſome of their ſhips in the harbour, burnt and raſed the baſe towne and Mils vp to the high towne, and ſo embarked away thence that night.</p>
               <p>Friday the 10. of May we ſet ſaile from the <hi>Corunna,</hi> and that day about noone met with vs againe ſixe ſaile of our Fléete, which at our ſetting foorth parted from vs about the Coaſt of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſday the 14. of May we doubled <hi>Cape finiſter,</hi> the winde then at the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:6025:65"/>Saturday the 22. of Iune we departed from <hi>Vigo</hi> in <hi>Galizia</hi> to goe towards <hi>Peniche.</hi> From <hi>Peniche</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie came to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they ſtaied ſome two or thrée daies expecting the comming of the Fleete to <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:</hi> of which preparation and ſtay there Sir <hi>Anthony Wingfield</hi> writeth thus: It may be demaunded (ſaith Sir <hi>Anthony Wingfield,</hi> writing vpon this voyage) why a matter of ſo great moment ſhould be ſo ſlenderly regarded, as that the Generall ſhould march with ſuch an Armie againſt ſuch an Enemie, before he knew either the fulnes of his owne ſtrength, or certaine meanes how he ſhould abide the place when he ſhould come to it. Wherein (ſaith he) I pray you remember the decrées made in the Councell at <hi>Peniche,</hi> and confirmed by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like proteſtation the firſt day of our March. That our Nauie ſhould méete vs in the Riuer of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in the which was the ſtore of all our prouiſion, &amp; ſo the meane of our tariance in that place: which came not though we continued till we had no munition left to entertaine a very ſmall fight. We are alſo to conſider that the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> (whether caried away with imagination by the aduertiſements he receiued from the Portugals, or willing by any promiſe to bring ſuch an Armie into his countrey, thereby to put his fortune once more in triall) aſſured the Generall that vpon his firſt landing there would be a reuolt of his ſubiects: whereof there was ſome hope giuen at our firſt entrie to <hi>Peniche,</hi> by the manner of the yéelding of the Towne and Fort: which made the Generall thinke it moſt conuenient ſpeedely to march to the principall place, thereby to giue courage to the reſt of the Countrey. The Friers alſo and the poore people that came vnto him promiſed that within two daies the Gentlemen and others of the countrey would come plentifully in: within which two daies came many moe Prieſts &amp; ſome very few Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on horſebacke: but not till we came to <hi>Torres Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> where they that noted the courſe of things paſſed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6025:66"/>
might ſomewhat diſcouer the weakenes of that people. There they tooke two daies more, and at the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of referred him till our comming to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that ſo ſoone as our Armie ſhould be ſeene there, all the inhabitants would be for the King and fall vpon the Spaniards.</p>
               <p>After two nights tariance at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſupplie of thrée thouſand foote and ſome horſe: but all his appointments being expired euen to the laſt of a night, all his horſe could not make a Cornet of 40. nor his foote furniſh two Enſignes fully, although they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried three or foure Colours: and theſe were altogether ſuch as thought to enrich themſelues by the ruine of their neighbours: for they committed more diſorders in euery place where we came by ſpoyle, then any of our owne.</p>
               <p>So while wée ſtaied at <hi>Lisbon</hi> wée both failed of the aide which the King <hi>Don Anthony</hi> promiſed vs, and wée expected, and alſo becauſe our Engliſh Fléete came not vnto vs thither to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> wée roſe vp thence and went for <hi>Caſcayes:</hi> where méeting with our Fléete wée returned altogether into <hi>England,</hi> where ſome of vs ariued at <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> others at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and others at <hi>London</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the moneth of Iuly <hi>Anno</hi> 1589. aforeſaid.</p>

            <p>His comming was generally ioyed at by all the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, but eſpecially by the inhabitants of <hi>Morlayx,</hi> whoſe good or ill eſtate depended on his comming: for both the Caſtle (a cruell neighbour) held againſt them, and the Duke <hi>Mercoeur</hi> was at hand to reſcue the defendants, who in aſſurance of reliefe from him acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

            <p>This Caſtle thus rendred, we ſtaied there ten daies, in reſpect that the Marſhall wanted money for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his people: whereof at the laſt he was fourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by thoſe of the towne of <hi>Morlayx.</hi> Then Mounſieur <hi>de Lyſcot,</hi> a wonderfull braue man, and the Baron of <hi>Molac</hi> were ſent before with ſome Harquebuziers, to the end they might blocke vp the Fort of <hi>Croyzon</hi> by <hi>Breſt,</hi> and preſerue the quarters about, who were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſted with foure hundred men out of our ſhips by Sir <hi>Martin Fourbyſher</hi> who commaunded the Engliſh ſhippings.

            <p>Hauing now all things readie for the batterie, I will as well as I can describe vnto you the Fort.</p>
            <p>You ſhall vnderſtand that more then two parts of the Fort was defended by the water, the reſt was made ſo excéeding ſtrong, as either by arte or charge could be done.</p>
            <p>On the South front thereof on each corner were two exceeding ſtrong Baſtions; that on the Weſt ſide was ſeuentéene paces in the front, that on the Eaſt ſide tenne paces: the Curtaine betwéene both was 37. foote thicke at the top; and within theſe they had made a very large intrenchment, and the Baſtions were excéeding well flanked from the Rocke by the water ſide, planting both on the flankers and baſtion ſome great Ordenance. We lay entrenched within thrée or foure paces of their Counterſcarp: the Frenchmen on the Eaſt ſide, and wée on the Weſt ſide, the batterie lay in the midſt betweene the trenches. Theſe things thus prouidently ordered by the Marſhall and our Generall; on the 23. our Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie began to play, and continued ſome ſeuen hundred Cannonodos, but did ſo little harme by reaſon of the ſtrength of the place, as ſcarſe any ſhew of a breach ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, onely wee did beate away their parrapete and ſome of their flankers: whereupon ſome hundred men commaunded by Captaine <hi>Lyſter,</hi> were ſent to view and ſee if they could hold the Counterſcarp. Then many of our braue men and gallants thirſting after honour, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to doe ſomewhat further, hauing poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the Enemies Counterſcarp, which onely they were commaunded to attempt, vndertooke the breach,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6025:76"/>
which they performed ſo well, as that notwithſtanding the vnſatiablenes of the place, and the great reſiſtance the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie made. Yet the moſt part of them attained to the verie top thereof, which they held for a while, but were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repulſed. This enterpriſe was with wonderfull great reſolution and valour ſeconded by S. <hi>Thomas Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keruil,</hi> who likewiſe got ſo farre as the point of the breach.</p>

               <p>But on the 30. being an exceeding wet morning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our powder and match were not fit for ſeruice, the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againe found thereby oppertunitie to fall out vpon the French trenches, and killed ſo betweene twenty and thirty of them at the leaſt, among whom was Mounſier <hi>Lyſcot,</hi> a verie braue gentleman one of the Marſhals of the Campe, who was abandoned by the French and their trenches wholie poſſeſſed by the enimie, but our Engliſh men did preſentlie repoſſeſſe them of their trenches, and killed ſome of the Spaniards.

               <p>By the ſeauenth of Nouember our mine was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble well perfected,<note place="margin">

on euery part aſſailed. But the Marſhall being that daie ſicke, ſent in the morning for our Generall, and ſhewed him his letters from the Gouernour of <hi>Rennes,</hi> and from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others, by which he was advertiſed that <hi>Iohn Don Ioan de la Auquilar</hi> Generall of the Spaniards, was marching towards <hi>Croyzon</hi> with all his Spaniſh forces to reſcue the fort, &amp; was alreadie aduaunced to <hi>La-cornan</hi> a village within fiue leagues of vs, and therefore aduiſed our General to diſlodge to <hi>Croyzon,</hi> thinking it not fit to hazard any men, hauing ſo ſtrong an enimie at hand ready to ioyne battell with them. But Sir <hi>Iohn Norice</hi> hauing his courage nothing daunted with the approch of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his heart ſeruing him both to win the fort by aſſault, and to encounter his enemie in the field: ſhewing what a diſhonour and diſreputation it were to abandon the ſiege, and alſo what little cauſe the enemie ſhould haue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance himſelfe farther if the fort were gotten, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming being onelie to reſue it. He ſo much importuned the Marſhall, that he gaue him wholie the ordering of that dayes ſeruice. Immediatlie our Generall gaue order to the Cannoniers for the batterie, and cauſed the Artillerie to play. Euerie man was aſſigned his charge, ſome to the aſſault, other with ſcalados to attempt to enter, and by 12. of the clocke he cauſed fire to be ſet to the mine: which albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it did not ſo much as was looked for, yet it made the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſo eaſie vnto the French, as that a man might haue ridden vpon horſe backe: and our men, namely Captaine <hi>Latham,</hi> Captaine <hi>Smith,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Iohn Norice,</hi> with diuers other gallant gentlemen gaue vp on the other bulwarke, and continued the aſſault without loſing one pace of the height vntill halfe an houre paſt foure, and in the end firſt entered the ſame, and ſeaſed vp on three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes that were there, and put euerie man they found in the fort (ſauing one alferez) to the ſword: ſome of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards leapt from the rocke to the water, but our Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with their ſmal boats met with them and ſlew them: ſome three or foure others being taken eſcaped with their

He neuer in all theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts ſhewed himſelfe daunted, he made ſundrie ſallies, but moſt vpon the French, to his great aduantage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.

This laſt aſſault continued almoſt fiue houres without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they neuer quailed vntill he was ſlaine, which was a ſmall time before the entrie, and then the greater part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine, the reſt ouer tired and hurt, were forced by our Gallants to retire, and ſo there were ſlaine of Spaniards in this fort almoſt 400. I note another ſigne of his great reſolution, for if he found anie willing onely to ſpeake of yeelding, he would cauſe him to be bound to a ſtake or poſt, and expoſed him to the breach, leauing his armes at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to fight for his defence. I hope no man will diſlike if I commend the valour of the enimie which was conquered, for the greater is the honour of them that were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.

This their vaine reſolution might well haue ſerued their turnes, if they had not dealt with our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall who was as reſolute as they, and therein ouermacht them. For the next day, <hi>Don Ioan de l'Aquilar</hi> ſending a trumpet for the redeeming of priſoners, our Generall ſent him anſwere that their ranſomes were payed, and that hee was now as readie and at leaſure to fight with him.

But the Archrebell <hi>Tyrone</hi> hearing of the Lord Deputies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe, did purpoſe (as it was thought) to haue poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelfe of the pace before him, that lieth betwéene the <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Dundalk</hi> aforeſaid, thereby to offend him in his paſſage. Word being brought to the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hereof, and he knowing that the ſaid Archrebell pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to paſſe within foure or fiue miles of the place where the Lorde Deputie encamped: the next night
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6025:80"/>
thereupon there were Scoutes ſent out, &amp; word brought by them that they had deſcried the ſaid Archrebels army. Whereupon order was giuen, that there ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine horſe and foote made readie, to attend the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie and Sir <hi>Iohn Norice,</hi> who went forwards with thoſe men, vntill they came within ſight of the Archre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels whole armie, being then reputed foure thouſand ſtrong of horſe and foote. But whether the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were ill guided, or whether the enemie in feare to ſaue himſelfe made more haſte then the Engliſh could follow, I know not, but for that time they eſcaped. But it ſeemed that feare ſerued to ſome good purpoſe: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in our paſſage through the place we were not at all intercepted, although the Enemie might haue done it with great aduantage.</p>
            <p>Now, after leauing ſome companies at the <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Calingford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1595.</note> the Engliſh returned to <hi>Dundalke,</hi> where (after the eſtabliſhing of that Garriſon,<note place="margin">

Not fully ſo well prouided, as when the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie went himſelfe, and therefore not ſo much expected to be performed by him, as by the Deputie) although the numbers of men were left vnto himſelfe for to name: it was giuen out that the Generall ſhould goe to victuall <hi>Armah,</hi> whatſoeuer was beſides pretended: and indéede that charge was faithfully performed by him, and as much for the Queenes honour, as any thing that hath béen done ſince the Archrebell <hi>Tyrone</hi> firſt entred into his rebellion.</p>

And at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals laſt returne from <hi>Armah,</hi> the Enemie ſent thrée hundred of his beſt ſhot to lodge in a place, where our Engliſh armie ſhould paſſe thorough, to méete the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and intercept him in his paſſage.

            <p>Hereupon <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſent down of his foote 200.

               </note>Now during Sir <hi>Richard Binghams</hi> ſequeſtration, Sir <hi>Iohn Norice</hi> had abſolutelie the commaund of his ſaid Prouince, and did (during his time) verie good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: namelie, in bringing into her Maieſties obedience manie of the beſt gentlemen of the countrie, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie praying, ſpoyling, and killing of the reſt, who (being deſperatelie obſtinate) held themſelues ſtill in rebellion. This his good ſeruice ſo performed againſt thoſe perſons, was ſometimes by the gariſons, and ſometimes by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as they marched through the countrie: inſomuch, that at the Generals departure forth of the countrie, hee left it in good termes.</p>
            <p>So about December, hee was called from thence to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where (after ſome ſtay there) the State hauing notice, that the gariſon of <hi>Armah</hi> was like to be diſtreſſed

(if they were not preſenlie releeued) the Generall was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to draw an Armie into the field, for the victualling of that place: but it ſhould appeare he was authoriſed to treate with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> about the victualling of it.

               </note> and ſo the Armie diſpoſed into the gariſons againe.</p>
            <p>It ſhould ſeeme, that beſides the victualling of that place, it was appointed that the ſaid <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſhould ſpeake perſonallie with the Commiſſioners: for that after it was agreed, that he ſhould ſuffer it to be victualled, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day to ſpeake with the Commiſſioners, Sir <hi>George Bowſer</hi> being then ioyned with the others in Commiſſion. What their conference was when they met, I know not altogether: but the manner of their meeting was this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrone</hi> hauing his Armie neere vnto the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Parley, cauſed foure or fiue hundred of his ſhot, together with his beſt horſe, to lie within a mile of the ſame his Armie, who were then encamped on the ſide of a hill nere <hi>Dundalk</hi>: there was ſixe gentlemen of the Generals troupe of horſe appointed to ſtand on the one ſide of the forde of a little riuer there, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie was, and ſixe others of <hi>Tyrones</hi> to ſtand on the further ſide with him in ſight of the Commiſſioners: he ſeeing the Commiſſioners come downe from our Armie, began to come forward himſelfe, not ſuffering any other to come with him, ſo ſaluting Sir <hi>Iohn Norice,</hi> told him he was glad to ſee him, being of his old acquaintance. Sir <hi>Iohn Norice</hi> likewiſe told him, that he would be glad to ſee him become a faithfull ſubiect: withal remembring him of the great fauours that her Maieſtie had ſhewed him hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that (yet) her Highnes was mercifullie enclined to haue him receiued into grace, if there were anie hope he would forſake his trecherous courſe, and become a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedient ſubiect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:6025:83"/>He anſwered with great proteſtations, that he was ſorie for his offence, and that there was no Prince in the world, whom he did or would more honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then her Maieſtie; neuer naming her Highnes, but with his hat off:<note place="margin">

               </note> all which ſhewes of obedience in him, made many beléeue that he meant to become other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then ſince he hath proued himſelfe.

               </note> that if he could but hope, that the Rebel <hi>Tyrone</hi> would vnfainedly accept of her Maieſties grace and mercie towards him, and that he the ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn Norice</hi> might haue béen the inſtrument to haue perſwaded him to become a faithfull ſubiect, he would not haue cared what labour or paines he endured to be aſſured thereof.</p>
            <p>It was thought that the proſecuting of <hi>Feugh Mac Hugh</hi> was contrary to the Articles agreed vpon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

the Commiſſioners and the Rebell <hi>Tyrone</hi>; and it ſhould appeare that he diſliked thereof. For after his pardon was ſent him by Sir <hi>Edward Moore,</hi> and he in all things (to the ſhew of the world) readie to haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thereof: on the ſudden his pardon was brought backe, and he returned excéedingly diſcontented. After the time of this laſt treatie with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> which was in the latter end of Ianuary aforeſaid, he remained vpon the borders of the North, ſtill expecting direction how to procéed in thoſe Northerne affaires, which continued from the moneth of Ianuary aforeſaid 1596. vntill the moneth of May in the yéere 1597. following,<note place="margin">1597.</note> for the ſpace of foure moneths.<note place="margin">

            <p>It was thought at the Lord <hi>Borowes</hi> comming ouer, the old grudge would be renewed: but I think that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was carried into <hi>England,</hi> before the Lord <hi>Borowes</hi> departed thence.
