            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, &amp; fellow Souldiers, though as a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I may be plaine, and a Souldier blunt, yet (I hope) as a Chriſtian I ſhall be honeſt, and as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject loyall in the expreſſion of that duty, which by the Laws of God, of nature, of the Kingdome, of gratitude, and of humanity is due to one, who is by Soveraigne Majeſty our King, by birth our Countryman, by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation a Proteſtant, by profeſſion, and actions a moſt pious Prince, and by his gratious compliance with us confident in our loyalty; the confluence of which obligements hath made all the powers of heaven, and earth to ſtand as it were in amaze, being big with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations to ſee how well or ill we deport our ſelves in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch high concernment. Who knowes but that the divine providence hath ſent his Majeſty to us, that we might be made the happy inſtruments of a well grounded peace, and of reſtoring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to its purity, the Church to its Rights, the King to his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and Lawes to their chanell, the Nobility, and Gentry to their honours and eſtates, and the people to their Liberties: if we reſolve upon theſe things, we may crown our Nation with honour, but if unworthy thoughts poſſeſſe our ſoules, we may juſtly feare, that (although ſalvation may come ſome other way,) yet we, and our party ſhall periſh. It is true that we have an hard game to play, but having the chiefe triumph trump in our owne hands, beſides ſo many honours, we ſhall prove but ill Gameſters, if we be not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the deale, and give Religion and Juſtice their due, beſides the ſaving of our owne ſtakes: but for the effecting hereof it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to looke with our owne eyes, and not through thoſe ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or proſpectives through which others preſent matters unto

us: we have hitherto been made beleeve, that the end, and deſign of all this war was to fetch the King from his evill Councellour to his Parliament of England; his Majeſty very often, (yea even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the dignity of ſo great a Prince) deſired to comply with them, but they inſtead of accepting his Majeſty, voted him a priſoner; his Majeſty having honoured us with his Royall preſence, there are now no evill Councellours about his, there are no Armies to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his non-compliance: what is now the rock of offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beleeve it (all the circumſtances of this War conſidered) we may juſtly feare that we have been made but a ſtale to the deſignes of thoſe ſeditious Schiſmaticks, who are now the obſtacles of the Kingdomes peace, and that they (like the Ape) made uſe of the Cats foot to plucke thoſe Cheſnuts out of the fire, which themſelves had deſigned for their owne palat; It behooves us now duly to examine the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and we are bound (according to the truſt repoſed in us by his Majeſty) to vindicate his Majeſties Rights, and to ſee her reſtored to all his legall Prerogatives: but ſhall I tell you the true cauſes of this preſent difference, and that which we may upon good grounds ſuſpect to be the true occaſion of this moſt horrid, and unnaturall War? His Majeſty at his Coronation in England tooke an Oath in theſe words: I will maintaine, and preſerve to you (the Biſhops) and to the Churches committed to your charges, all Canonicall privileges, and I will be your protector, and defender to my power, by the aſſiſtance of God, as every good King in his Kingdome in right ought to defend the Biſhops, and Churches under their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: then (laying his hand on the booke on the Communion Table) He ſaith, theſe things I have before promiſed I ſhall performe and keep, ſo helpe me God, and the contents of this booke. Here is an Oath able to ſtrike terrour and amazement into the hearts of all, (the due circumſtances there of being conſidered) as well as feare and reverence in his Majeſty about the performance of the ſame: it is taken by Gods Anoynted, in Gods Houſe, at Gods Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, upon Gods Booke, tendred by Gods Miniſters, to defend Gods Rights, in the preſence of Gods people, and that with the impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods curſes, and forfeiture of Gods bleſſings; ſo that if ever any Oath could properly, by way of eminency, be called the Oath of God, this is it: His Majeſty therefore out of his Princely piety (conceiving himſelfe bound in duty to God, in honour to the Church, in Juſtice to His Subjects, and in obedience to Chriſtian
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114142:3"/>
principles to maintaine his Oath,) refuſeth to conſent to the root and branch bills againſt the Epiſcopacy: but ſome (whom I will not name) forgetfull of his Majeſties honour, and conſcience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to execute their owne deſignes in altring the government of the Church, have raiſed a Militia, and called us into their ayd, thereby to force a compliance from his Majeſty, and the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Party, with them. And now what ſoule is not aſtoniſhed? what heart doth not bleed? whoſe eares do not tingle? to heare that we (unhappy we) ſhould, under the pretence of holy Covenants, be made the inſtruments of ſuch horrid impieties? What could the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and all the fiends of hell have thought on more impious then perjury? what more obnoxious to the Church of God then Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege? what more rebellious then by force of Armes to compell the King to both? what more blaſphemous to God, and ſcandalous to Chriſtianity, then to do all theſe things under the name &amp; pretence of Religion? what, was God the God of truth when he gave us the Precept of performing all our Vows, and is he now become the God of Perjurie? did God deteſt the withholding of Tythes, and Offerings as robbery done to himſelfe, and is he now become a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Sacrilege? did he enjoyn ſubjection to Superiours as to his owne Ordinances, and that upon paine of damnation, and is he now become a Generall to Rebels, whereby to force the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Oath, and conſcience? Heare ô heavens, and hearken ô earth, if ever any ſuch thing were committed, that a great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of a Kingdome, of Chriſtians, of Proteſtants, of Subjects, of thoſe that were ſworn to defend the Kings rights, ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance tumults, connive at aſſaults upon his Majeſty, examine the circumſtances of his birth to prove Baſtardy in him, that thereby they might remove him, and his Royall Poſterity, from the Crown, raiſe a Militia againſt him, vote him that he was ſeduced by evill Counſell, that he ſought the deſtruction of the Parliament, to bring in Popery, and to rule by an arbitrary way, vote his Royall Conſort to be guilty of high Treaſon for her loyalty, murder his Nobility, deſtroy his Gentry, oppreſſe his Subjects, wincke at the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hew-and-cties of Britannicus, and vote his Majeſty to priſon, becauſe out of a pious, and princely reſolution, he is fully bent to maintaine his Oath, rather to part from his life, and Crowne, then from that Religion, and Government, both in Church <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

to maintaine. Good God! what ſhall we ſay to this? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we cauſe our ſhame to ſlye? to whom ſhall we appeale for excuſes? ſhall we aſcend up into heaven for them? Loe there we ſhall find all the Saints, and Angels of God, who continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of their heavenly Father, deteſting thoſe new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of forcing the Kings conſcience contrary to his Oath; as ſuch whereof all the Patriarches, and Prophets, and Martyrs of God were formerly ignorant. Shall we appeale unto men? behold Ireland con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, our owne Country up in Armes, the greateſt part of the Nobility, and Gentry, and all the heads of the Univerſities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the learned part of the Clergie of England, deteſting our actions with as much abomination, as ever the Egyptians hated the profeſſion of Shepherds: and if we had put the caſe at the election of the Parliament members, if the King will not, contrary to his Oath taken at his Coronation, conſent to the pulling down of Epiſcopacy, and alteration of the Church Government, whether or no it be the Subjects minds by force of Armes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him thereunto, contrary to his Oath and conſcience, all people would have been ready to ſtone us, as not thinking it poſſible that ſuch horrid impieties ſhould enter into the hearts, or thoughts of the great Councell of the kingdome; and certainly if we had ingenuouſly confeſſed the truth at firſt, without the cloake of a thorough Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or of fetching evill Councellers from the King, we ſhould never have raiſed ſo great a power: and if we look beyond the Seas, we are accounted the ſhame of Chriſtians, and the ſcorn of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, yea even all Proteſtant Churches (when they are really informed, againſt what principles we have proceeded) will hate, and deteſt our actions: ſhall we ranſacke the ſacred Scriptures? I have ſhewed you before againſt what divine precepts we have proceeded, but behold there indeed the pure fountaines of living water blundred, and abuſed for the juſtification of our cauſe; when one ſhall tell us, that we may fight againſt our King, becauſe it is written, Thou ſhalt binde their Kings in chaines, and their Nobles with linckes of Iron: Another (blaſpheming the King with horrid ſlanders) ſhall conclude that Tophet was prepared of old, yea for the King it was prepared: And a third (as though he would fore-prophecye of the Kings deſtruction) ſaith, though <hi>Jeconiah</hi> were the signet upon my right hand, yet will I plucke him from thence: Are not theſe horrid things, ſuch as would make a dumbe

man ſpeake, and a wiſe man dumbe with horrour and amazement? If (fellow Souldiers) you intend to be ruled by the Scripture, let me put you a Scripture-caſe; in <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeeking to make havocke of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> contrary to the Oath given them, you may obſerve, how this Oath was obtained by fraud, and a lye; that it was expreſly againſt the Covenant of Promiſe given to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and the people; that it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven raſhly without asking counſell of God, and to a people by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heathens, by Religion Idolaters, and by condition vaſſals, to be drawers of water and hewers of wood; that what <hi>Saul</hi> did was at the leaſt 300 yeares after the Oath given, in which time that Oath may ſeeme to ſome to be antiquated; and that he did it in zeale to the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> But what the ſucceſſe? the bloud of the men ſhed by reaſon of this perjury cryed aloud to heaven for vengeance; Gods eares were opened to their cries, he puniſheth the whole Land with Famine, and would not be paci<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Covenant? what were this, but under pretence of pulling downe Popery to ſet up Idolatry, and to lay aſide all the Lawes of God for the Covenant, and for the Votes and Orders of the Houſes? but if the Covenant be to maintaine Religion, and the Kings honour, we ſhall then truly performe the Covenant in both, when we deteſt thoſe Doctrines, and actions, that diſhonour God, and the King, by accurſed Perjury; and that were a Covenant with hell that ſhould covenant to force the King to forſweare himſelfe. But tell me, (I pray you) is it the Votes, and Orders of the Houſes, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or the Commandements of God that ſhall juſtifie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us the laſt day? ſhall we plead the Lawes of England? but (I pray you) what Lawes can be of force to mate themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lawes of God? and what Lawes of the Kingdome were ever produced to juſtifie the raiſing of a Militia, and the calling in of Forraine ayde, and joyning in Covenants, thereby to force the Kings violation of his Coronation Oath? Againe (if we beleeve them that are profeſſed in thoſe Lawes) they lay this as a maxime, that no Law, Statute, or Cuſtome, which is either againſt the Law of God, or Principles of Nature, can be of any validity, or force, but are voyd, and null in Law; they ſay further, that therefore this Oath was by the Fundamentall Lawes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Kingdome preſented to his Majeſty of purpoſe to bind his conſcience to preſerve the Eccleſiaſticall Rights, for the comfort, and encouragement of true Piety, and Learning: that as the Lawes, and Statutes of <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> and other recordes ſhould bind the hands of the ſubjects, ſo this Oath ſhould binde the conſcience of the King from violating the Churches Rights: and therefore it is expreſſed as a ſeverall Article in the Coronation-Oath, that the King ſhould never aſſent to any Act, that ſhould trench upon their Rights, and that howſoever the Kings conſcience was at liberty to conſent to the alteration of any other of the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall lawes, yet it ſhould be bound as to this by the eſpeciall and direct words of the Oath; as likewiſe his Majeſty is bound by the words of that Oath, to doe juſtice to all: and therefore by vertue of this Oath, as well as of honour and Juſtice, if the Houſes tender any Bills which his Majeſty conceives to be againſt common right, or Juſtice, his Majeſty is bound not to give his Majeſties Royall aſſent thereunto, which cannot but ſtrike amazement in all knowing men, that any ſhould be ſo impudently wicked, as againſt all the lights of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114142:6"/>
God, of Nature, and the Kingdome to trie the King with perjury, becauſe he will not conſent to the root and branch bils againſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy; and the Royall party deſires no other happineſſe then to be admitted to a full and free diſputation upon that point; and that their reaſons might be publiſhed in all Churches, and declared to all the world, for the juſtification of his Majeſties and their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in this cauſe. Againſt this ſhall we plead the pride and arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Biſhops and Clergy? but I feare this will be with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pride; ſuppoſe ſome Biſhops and Clergy exalt themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of Gods people, muſt we therefore exalt our ſelves againſt God, and Gods Anointed? becauſe ſome Biſhops are proud, muſt ye ſubjects therefore take up Armes to force the King to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and ſacrilege? let their inſolencies be puniſhed, but let Gods and the Churches Rights remaine. It is granted that ſome of the Clergy by the irregularitie of their actions, and laying clogges upon mens conſciences, gave a great ſcandall to the Church, but theſe might be legally proceeded againſt; and what innovations they had brought in contrary to law might have been reformed; but muſt therefore the function, contrary to all the principles of Religion, Law, and reaſon, be rooted out? becauſe there was a <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt the Apoſtles, did Chriſt take away the Apoſtleſhip? becauſe many Angels did rebell againſt God, did God deſtroy the whole Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy? Suppoſe ſome Biſhops ſought to ſet themſelves the one at the right hand of the King, the other at his left, as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did at Chriſts; muſt their ambition cauſe all to be deſpiſed? If God ſhould root out all mankinde, becauſe ſome are moſt refractory wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons, what would become of us? the doctrines of rooting out all for the abuſes of ſome, are agreeable neither to the precept, nor patterne of him, who will have the wheat and ta<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es grow together till the harveſt: and it hath formerly been accounted the wiſedome of Parliaments to reforme abuſes by regulating, not by extirparton. But yet what hath the righteous done? whoſe eyes are ſo ſwelled with pride, or blinded with malice, that doe not ſee how many Saints of God there were both of the Biſhops, Doctors, and other Clergy, who willingly laid downe their lives for that Cauſe, and Religion, which his Majeſty doth now maintaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for us to ſay, that if they had lived in theſe dayes, they would have ended with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114142:7"/>
us, is a ſpeech as full of arrogancie, as ignorance, and expreſly againſt all their actions; and how many are there of their ſucceſſors, who, before this unhappy difference, were men famous in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and have now none other fault but their conſtancy to their Religion, and their loyalty to their King? ſhall we then juſtice our Cauſe, for that God hath gone along with our Armies? ô poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures if we have no better then ſuch fig-leaves to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our nakedneſſe! becauſe God doth often bleſſe the adulterous ſeed, is he therefore either the cauſe, or lover of adultery? if we have nothing but the power of the ſword for the juſtification of our Cauſe, by this title, the blaſphemies of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, and the dotages of the Popiſh ſuperſtitions in the Legend may lay claime to heaven as well as we: but what if God out of the heat of his wrathfull indignation towards us, have (as he uſeth to doe to thoſe whom he gives over to a reprobate ſence) given us the victory, thereby to obdurate us in our rebellion, that through pride of heart, and vaine conceit of a juſt Cauſe, we might be made more uncapable of repentance, and pardon? It is true, that God hath had a controverſie with the Engliſh, and we for their ſinnes may be made the rod of Gods anger in puniſhing the King, and all his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all party; but we know not how ſoone for our owne ſinnes God may throw this rod into the fire. Perchance you will ſay, that the King in taking away the Churches Rights ſhould doe no more, then what he himſelfe in part, and his Royall Predeceſſors have formerly conſented unto: but who knowes not, that his Majeſty never willingly agreed to the abrogation of any of the Churches dues; and if his pious heart ſmite him for cutting off the lap of their skirts, muſt he be forced to ſtrip them as naked as the yong man that left his linnen garment behind him? and who knows not that all thoſe Kings, who have been regardleſſe of their Oathes in taking away the Churches Rights, have been purſued by the hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo that there is not ſo much as the name, or poſterity of any of them remaining? and who knowes but that thoſe acts of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie might be amongſt thoſe crowdes of ſinnes, which have cryed ſo lowd for judgement againſt theſe Kingdomes? But ſhall we ſay that this Oath is an evill Oath, and ſo evill in the taking, and worſe in the keeping? this were to caſt dirt upon the face of the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114142:7"/>
conſtitution of that Church, &amp; State of that kingdom which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the tenure of this Oath to his Majeſty. But wherin (I pray you) doth the malignity of this Oath conſiſt? ſuppoſe that there were now a Parliament of Papiſts, who would take up arms under pretence of a thorow Reformation, and of voting all Proteſtants that ſhould ſide with the King, as evill Counſellers, and of fetching the King from them to his great Councell, ſhould not we that are Proteſtants ſtand up in his Majeſties juſtification? ſhould not we abominate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of theſe lawes of God, of nature, and of the Kingdome, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of the power of the great Councell, as Jeſuiticall impoſtures? is it unlawfull for the King to breake his Oath for any Votes, Orders, or Ordinances of Popiſh Parliaments and ſhall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants now doe that which they ſo much deteſt in Papiſts? but if there be any that will plead for Baal let them ſtand up, and produce their ſtrong reaſons, let the caſe be truly ſtated to the Aſſembly of Divines, and if they have any new Directories for the regulating of the Kings conſcience againſt his Oath, as well as for thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles Creed out of the Church, let them be publiſhed to the world, that all Chriſtians may judge how Orthodoxe they are. Firſt let them reſolve whether or no the King (not withſtanding the taking of this oath) be bound to take away the Churches rights? and whether or no (like ſo many Popes) they or the Houſes have power to diſpenſe with Oaths, and to nullifie them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Secondly, if the King will not bend his conſcience to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into Perjury, by the ſcorching heat of their zeale, whether or no it be lawfull for the Subjects to raiſe a Militia, and to call us in to their aide to force the King thereunto, and whether or no it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſo to do? Thirdly, where the King is purſued becauſe he will not commit Perjury, whether or no the Subjects by that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt which they are to give to God, by the duty which they owe to the King, and by the Oaths of Allegeance which they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, be not bound to ſtand up in his Majeſties aide, for the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſties honour, and conſcience? Fourthly, where the Subjects do upon theſe grounds engage themſelves in his Majeſties ſervice, whether or no it be according to the rules of Religion, or Juſtice, to vote, or publiſh them to be enemies to God, and all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, Papiſts, popiſhly affected, Traitors to the King, enemies to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114142:8"/>
their Country, diſturbers of the Peace, and ſuch like? Fifthly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no all thoſe Clergy-men that have taken the Oathes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience, and to maintaine the diſcipline, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; all thoſe of the Laity that have taken the Oathes of Offices, of truſts and of allegeance, can juſtifie the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Oathes, to comply with the two Houſes, in forcing his Majeſty to violate this? Sixthly, whether or no all the laws of God, and man, which juſtifie, and vindicate the Kings Rights, and conſcience, are to be eſteemed as void and null in Law; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no all the bloud ſhed in this moſt horrid and unnaturall war ſhall be imputed to them, who ſeeke to vindicate his Majeſties honour, and conſcience, or to thoſe, who (under pretence of a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Reformation, and of fighting againſt evill Counſellors) give the King ſo many battells, and turne theſe Kingdomes into ſo many Acheldama's, filling them not only (as <hi>Manaſſes</hi> did <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> with bloud from one end to the other, but alſo with ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, Sacriledges, and horrid Blaſphemies? If the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines be aſhamed to own theſe accurſed impieties, why ſhould not we be aſhamed to defend thoſe things by our Swords, which they are aſhamed to juſtifie with their Pens? I thinke impiety is not yet grown to that height of impudency, that any man dare diſpute theſe queſtions, in the diſcuſſing whereof it will appear, that, if all the Precepts of Divinity were taken out of the Word of God, all the dictates of reaſon blotted out of the Book of nature, and all the maximes ſpunged out of the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome, which have been violated in the juſtification of this War againſt the King, there would be neither Scripture, Reaſon, nor Law left us how to walk as Chriſtians, Men, or Subjects: but if there be any whoſe deſperate condition hath ſold him (like <hi>Ahab)</hi> to work wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe before the Lord, and to plead for the violation of the Kings Oath, that were not only to ſharpen the Tongues and Pens of men, but even the Arrowes of Gods judgements againſt us, and our cauſe, and to make the enemies of God to blaſpheme Religion, yea to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves, our Kingdoms, our Religion, and all that we have, to the contempt and ſcorn of all nations, and Religions whatſoever. What Kingdom can with ſafety, enter into a League, or confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with our King; what forreign Nation can with ſecurity relie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114142:8"/>
upon the honeſty of our Merchants; what Religion will not feare to hold Communion with ſuch a Religion, or Nation, whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, either in Religion, or State, maintaine, that the Subjects may take up armes to force the King contrary to his Oath, yea his Coronation-Oath? how often have our Pulpits rung, that faith is to be kept with Hereticks, and ſhall now the Subjects take up arms to force the King to Perjury? Lord, what ſhall I ſay? Is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent now removed into <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths Chappell? Is the Popes Chaire at <hi>Rome</hi> changed into the Speakers Chaire at <hi>Weſtminſter?</hi> muſt our new reformed Religion be founded upon the foure corner ſtones of Blaſphemy, Perjury, Sacrilege, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? and ſhall we temper the morter thereof with the bloud; and teares of his Majeſties loyall people, of our fellow Subjects, of our Brethren, and of thoſe, who live, and dye in the ſame faith of Chriſt with our ſelves? I tremble to thinke what the event of theſe things may be though we have hitherto eſcaped the ſword, I pray God that a Serpent out of the wall doe not bite us: If it were taken ſo ill that the late Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and ſome other Counſellors of State ſhould alter the Kings Oath in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (the ſubſtance of the Oath ſtill remaining) how ill will it be taken that we ſhould riſe in armes to force the Kings conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Oath? but admitting it had been but a private Oath, nay if a wicked Oath, and his Majeſties conſcience had led him to take and defend the ſame, what Doctrine is there in the Scripture that inables the ſubjects to riſe in rebellion againſt him for it? we may now ſee the Scaene of the Churches ſtage ſtrangely altered; the Church, and true Religion formerly ſuffered perſecution by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Kings; but now Kings (yea pious Kings) ſuffer perſecution by the tyranny of Religion: theſe theſe and ſuch like arguments are thoſe rocks upon which the Royall party hath built their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who, although they be overcome by the ſword, are not yet vanquiſhed in their cauſe; for which they make their appeales to heaven, and call God and man to witneſſe their innocency, rejoycing in nothing more, then that there will be a day of Judgement, when the righteous, and impartiall Judge ſhall judge both them, and us according to the juſtice and innocency of the cauſe: in the meane time, now that God hath done with them, who knowes <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 words">

he may begin with us, and call us to an accompt? Let us therefore haſten on the peace, thereby to prevent thoſe clouds of bloud, which threaten to diſsolve themſelves upon us in fire, and haile-ſtones; let us lay the foundation thereof in heaven, by rooting out thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed doctrines of ſedition, which have watered our furrowes with ſo much bloud; let us by a generall Councell choſen out of all the Provinces within his Majeſties dominions, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and known Laws of the 3 ſeverall Kingdomes, reſtore religion to its purity of doctrine, &amp; the Church to its unity of diſcipline: but for us to thinke of a Reformation by faction and rebellion, and to talke of Religion whilſt we hold up our ſwords to force the Kings conſcience to perjury, is to blaſpheme, not to maintaine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and yet, as one abſurdity opens the doore to a thouſand more, and one ſinne makes way for another, I have heard ſome of our leven, (finding that they have done what they could by the ſword, and all to no purpoſe) thinke to cover the ſhame of this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent with a worſe; and (as <hi>David</hi> thought to cover his adultery by murder,) ſo theſe would cover their murder by adulterating the Church of God, and would cloake the forcing of the Kings conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by armes, with proceeding againſt him by Eccleſiaſticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but was ever any hereticke ſo blaſphemouſly impudent, as to talke of a <hi>tradatur Satanae</hi> againſt their King, becauſe he will not perjure himſelfe to commit ſacrilege and Apoſtacy: this were to deliver our ſelves not the King to Satan, and to burne our ſelves in hell for thus blaſpheming God, and the King, whilſt his Majeſty ſignes his Halelujahs in heaven; the curſe cauſeleſſe ſhall not come, and the arrowes that we ſhall ſhoot againſt him will fall upon our own heads: this was not it for which his Majeſty put himſelfe upon our loyalty: If the King would have been forced againſt his conſcience, hee needed not to have hazarded either his life, or Crowne, or to have committed himſelfe to our truſt, he could have forſworne himſelfe without our counſell, or compulſion; let us take heed that we make not a prey of that deere, which flyes to us for ſuccour from the Hunts-mans hounds. Let us poure balm into the wound of the three Kingdoms, by vindicating his Majeſties honour, and conſcience, and by reſtoring the King, his Royall Conſort, the Prince, the Church, and the other ſubjects to their lawfull Rights;
