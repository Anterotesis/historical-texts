         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the right reuerende Father in God, and his singuler good Lorde, Gylbert by the mercifull prouidence of God, Bishop of Bathe and Welles: Iohn Northbrooke, wisheth all health and peace, in Christe Iesu our only Sauiour.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F my power and abilitie, were</hi> aunswereable to my good will (right reuerende father) this token of myne humble dutie, which I doe now offer vnto your honour, shoulde be as greate and precious, as by reason of the contrarie, it is base and slender. VVherfore I most humblie beseche your honour in no worse parte to accepte this litle offer, then as the present of hym, that is bound of duetie to loue you, whiche would haue brought better, if his power had beene thereafter. But followyng the example of the poore widowe,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> whiche is so highly [of our Sauiour] commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Gospell. I offer vnto your honour, parte of suche fruictes, as haue growen in a poore studentes Garden. I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been assured of your L. that you will accepte that, that a man hath,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> and not that he hath not, and this Sainct Paul geueth for doctrine, whereby to encourage the godly forwardes, in the Lordes busines. For all are bydden to the buildyng of Gods house,<note place="margin">Exod. 25.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for when the Tabernacle of the lorde was made by Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, euery one brought suche as he had:<note place="margin">4</note> some brought golde and siluer:<note place="margin">5</note> other some brought precious stones: others brought clothe:<note place="margin">6</note> others skinnes and heere of Goates and weathers: others brought woodde.<note place="margin">7</note> And the poore and meanest sorte, brought somewhat also,<note place="margin">8</note> for they brought stones: and all this was put to the worke. Euen so I iudge, for the buildyng of this house of the Lorde,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.17. Ephe. 2.21. Cap. 5.26.</note> whiche is his Churche, euery one shoulde and ought to bryng suche as they haue: some more, some lesse, accordyng to the talentes whiche the Lorde of the house hath geuen them to profite withall.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.15.</note> I wil content my selfe, to bring the litle stones of the common sorte for this buildyng, and I hope that the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="tcp:21676:3"/>
of the worke, will not refuse my seruice, nor my litle stones, (although they be not hewen of the finest sorte, yet I truste they be all hewen out by the Square and rule of Gods worde) foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they may be a furtheraunce to the buildyng (as I hope they wilbe with gods helpe.) For, as many as are christians, haue geuen their faith vnto Christe in their baptisme, to forsake the deuill, the worlde, and the fleshe, and to continewe Christes faithfull souldiers and seruauntes, to fight vnder his Banner, all the dayes of their life, to the healping and mainteynyng of the warring,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The causes that made the aucthour to set foorth this booke. First cause.</hi> Matth. 3.12.</note> and striuing faith. All this well considered, three causes hath moued mee, to set foorth this litle treatise of my faith, at this tyme. The first is, for that the Lorde hath in his handes, to fanne, examine, and make cleane againe his Churche. To whom also it were verie good (in my iudgement) that the faith of euery one shoulde bee knowen, and especially, of those whiche make profession of the Gospell, to instructe others, as the Doctours, Pastours, and Ministers of the worde and Sacramentes, to the ende that the false Prophetes and Papistes, whiche nowe bowe downe their shoulders, and stretche out their eares to the false papisticall doctrine of that Antichriste of Rome, were knowen, driuen awaie, and caste out from among the godly and faithfull. For as Barnarde saieth:<note place="margin">Barnard super cant. Serm. 66.</note> 
               <hi>Plus longè nocet falsus catholicus, quàm si verus apparcat haereticus:</hi> Therefore, Christe gaue vs warnyng to be ware of them that come in Sheepes clothyng, but inwardly are rauening woolues,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.15.

Iosua. 9.3.4.</note> comming and liuyng amonges vs, as the Angels of light, but all is to beguile the innocent and simple people, to make them twise the children of hell worse then them selues are. How Iosua was deceiued by the dissemblyng Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites through their fained and cloked holines, saiyng: VVe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come from farre, for the name of the Lorde thy God, the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie declareth: So (right reuerende father) in these our daies, wee haue many, and specially of the Cleargie, that can saie nowe to our godly Bishops, how thei are come from Rome, for the name of the Lorde our God, with their moulded and wafer cake bread, olde ragged garmentes and shoes, when in deede it is but meere dissimulation that they doe, to enter into the Churche for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

preachers. And these men haue learned Arius practise, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey all their beleefe of the Romishe faith, into their secrete bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes: and yet wil with hande and penne declare by subscribing and swearyng, as though they were throughly perswaded and conuerted. They drawe nye with tongue and penne vnto vs, but their heartes are to Rome:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Papistes haue Iacobs voyce, but Esaus hart and handes.</hi> Eusebius.</note> a number of them haue gospell talke, but yet a Romishe faith, an Englishe face, but Spanishe hearts. VVe reade in Eusebius Caesariensis: that writeth how that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius, the father of Constantine, fained vppon a tyme that he woulde put out all the christians, whiche woulde abide in their faith and religion, from their honours and offices, but in deede the Godly woulde in no wise denie, but rather choosed the losse of promotions and honour: but the others denied the true faith bicause they would not loose their dignities.<note place="margin">

               </note> Vpon which triall, he excluded these dissemblers, and double faced neuters, out of his realme, saiyng: They woulde not be faithfull to hym, which had broken their faithe vnto God. So no doubt, if these men in our daies were tried, we should finde of them the lyke. Therfore, if they were called, not onely to confesse their faith, with worde and penne,<note place="margin">1. Peter. 3.15.</note> but also to geue a reason of their faith, to proue, and openly to shewe by textes of the holy Scriptures, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest reasons builded thereon, in whom thei beleue, what thei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, wherfore they beleue, and how they beleue, in open pulpit, and also in writyng, shoulde do a thousande tymes more good, then that they now doe. For they thinke nowe, that if they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, obserue the order of seruice, and weare a side gowne, a square Cap, a Cope, and a Surples, none can saie blacke is their eyes, but that they are good protestantes: yet all this while they run into hugger mugger a whispering in corners, saiyng to the simple people:<note place="margin">

               </note> beleue not this newe doctrine, it is naught, it will not long endure, although I vse order among them outwardly, my hearte and profession is from them, agreeyng with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church of Rome. No, no (saie they) we do not preache nor yet teache openly, we reade their newe deuised homilies for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to satisfie the tyme for a season.<note place="margin">

And by this meanes, thei shoulde be easely tried out, and those that are not sounde, nor yet meete, driue them out of the Church, and make them wood-cariers, and water bearers, in the common weale, as Iosua did the Gibeonites, teachyng by their example, others to beware to dissemble in their profession,<note place="margin">Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21676:13"/>
soule of Christe: but that he went, <hi>tantum spiritu,</hi> onely in his spirite. For as M. <hi>Caluin</hi> saieth: <hi>Sunt autem haec longe diuersa, animam Christi venisse, et Christum praedicasse spiritus sui potentia.</hi> These are (saith he) great differences (to say) that the soule of Christe to haue come: And (to say) Christe to haue preached by the power of his spirite. Nowe (friendly reader) here is the difficultie in these two wordes: <hi>Spiritus, &amp; carcer:</hi> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and the prison. Understande that by this worde (spirite) is not meant nor taken in this place, for the soule of Christe: but for the power of his Godhead. For it was not his soule that was able to quicken him self, but the spirite of god quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him: that is, his godly and diuine power that quickned his humanitie. <hi>Paul</hi> openeth this very plainly to the <hi>Cor.</hi> saying: Christ was crucified concernyng his infirmitie,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.</note> yet liueth he through the power of God. &amp;c. Where <hi>Peter</hi> nameth it the spirite, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the power of God. And he calleth it the operation of God, which raysed (and quickned) him from the dead.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.12.</note> And to the Romanes he shewth that the vertue of the spirite was not onely shewed in the person of Christe: but is shewed also vpon vs all, saying: If the spirite of him that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp Iesus from the dead,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</note> dwell in you: he that raysed vp Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, shall also quicken your mortall bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that his spirit dwelleth in you. By these places we may vnderstande what <hi>Peter</hi> meant by the spirite: that is, Gods diuine power and might, and not the soule of Christ.</p>
            <p>Nowe, in that <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it a prison, is not to be taken here,<note place="margin">The Greke worde signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth an high towre where watche is kept. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</note> that he vnderstandeth by it, the place of hell for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he aludeth it to that place of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where it is sayde: <hi>Non permanebit spiritus meus in homine inaeternum, quia ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro est:</hi> My spirite shall not striue with man, because he is but fleshe. So that it is a common phrase of speache in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that <hi>Peter</hi> here vseth, for the Prophete <hi>Esai</hi> hath the like saying:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 42.7.</note> 
               <hi>Vt aperires oculos caecorum, &amp; educeres de conclusione vinctum, de domo carceris sedentes in tenebris:</hi> That thou mayest open the eyes of the blinde, and bryng out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darknesse out of the prison house.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 29.9.</note> And in another place he saith: <hi>Vt dicetis his qui vincti
<pb facs="tcp:21676:13"/>
sunt, exite: &amp; his qui in tenebris, reuelamini:</hi> That thou mayest say to the prisoners,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gala.</hi> 4.3.23.</note> go foorth: and to them that are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, shewe your selues. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in a maner vseth the like phrase, saying: Before saith came, we were kept vnder the lawe, and shut vp vnto the faith, which should afterwarde be reuealed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1.</note> Our sauiour Christe vseth it often, where it is written: The spirite of the Lord is vpon me, because he hath annoynted me, that I should preache the Gospell to the poore: he hath sent me, that I shoulde heale the broken hearted, that I shoulde preache deliueraunce to the captiues, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of sight to the blinde: that I shoulde set at libertie them that are bruised. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> him selfe, in the fourth Chapter folowing,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6.</note> speaketh of this matter: but yet in other wordes, saying: For vnto this purpose was the Gospell preached also vnto the dead, that they myght be condemned accordyng to men in the fleshe: but myght lyue accordyng to God in the spirite: that is to say, the Gospell was preached (not to the dead bodyes in the graues, nor to the soules in hell) but to them of tyme past, which nowe are dead, to the entent that they might haue béen condemned, or dead vnto sinne in the fleshe, and might haue liued to God in the spirite: which two are the effect of the Gospell.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So nowe, we may perceaue by the conference of those places, what <hi>Peter</hi> meaneth by the spirites that were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that are all those whiche were in the prison of sinne and death. &amp;c. For <hi>Peters</hi> onely purpose in this place is, to set foorth the vniuersall preaching of repentaunce, which was preached in the tymes of <hi>Noe</hi>: euen with the same open and vniuersall preachyng,<note place="margin">

that were shutte vp in the prisone of wickednesse and synne, and for their synfulnesse, are worthie of death, and hell. So saieth <hi>Titleman,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The verie texte it self, plainly declareth that this expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true. For if wee marke the woordes of the texte, as they lye in order,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.19.</note> it will soone open Peters whole meanyng. The wordes are these: But was quickened in the spirit: by whiche he also went, and preached vnto the spirites that were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone (then immediately followeth what those spirites were) whiche (saieth he) were in time passed disobedient, when once the longe sufferyng of God abode.

But first and formost, it is vncertaine whether this booke, out of the which this sentence is taken, be saint <hi>Augustines,</hi> or not. For the stile and phrase of this booke, doeth nothing resemble the phrase that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth vse in those bookes that be certainely knowen to be his.<note place="margin">Augustines modestie in writing of matters of religion.</note> For, this holy doctour doeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with great modestie and sobrietie, both write &amp; speake of those thinges that do parteyne vnto the Church, &amp; vnto the saluation of men, being neuer woont to affirme anye thing rashly, without some sure grounde or foundation in Gods worde, which thing he doth not obserue in this booke.</p>
               <p>For what Scriptures doth he aleadge for to proue that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous sentence, that he doth geue against those poore infantes that dye without baptisme? And yet he saith, holde this for a suretie, and not only in this place, but also in many other, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout al the whole booke, hauing alwaies these words in his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21676:47"/>
mouth: holde for a suretie: beléeue vndoubtedly. I do here let passe many other reasons, that did moue many great learned men to doubt of the aucthour of this booke.</p>
               <p>But let vs graunt that it is Saint <hi>Augustines.</hi> Ye haue hearde already, howe he doeth trimme their newe forged <hi>Lymbe,</hi> that they do assigne vnto the poore séely infantes, that either be styll borne, or dye without baptisme. Againe, we must not thinke, that he him selfe wyll haue these wordes of his to be taken after the rigour of the letter. And therefore we must consider what occasions he might haue, to write after the same sort. For, if the necessitie and vnablenesse doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them that be of age, why shoulde young infantes be more vnexcusable, which haue yet a more reasonable excuse, then they that be of yeres can haue? For, when they dye being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, either in their mothers belly, or out of it, was it long of them that they were not baptized?</p>
               <p>Hath God conceaued a greater hatred against those poore séely infantes, which are onely infected with originall sinne, than against them which being of age, haue besides originall sinne, ten hundred thousande talentes weyght of their owne actuall sinnes? Although the baptisme of water were as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vnto saluation, as ye do make it: yet if there be some exception for the one, by what right or reason shoulde it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vnto the other, when the cause and excuses be a like?</p>
               <p>But we must weigh and marke,<note place="margin">
                     <p>What moued Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine to write as he did of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not baptized. Some make any ydol of the sacramentes.</p>
                     <p>Others make none account of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Wherein the Anabaptistes exceeded.</p>
                  </note> that in Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> time, there were many that had not the Sacramentes in such estimation and reuerence, as they ought to haue them. As in these our dayes we see, that some folke do attribute so much vnto them, that they make of the visible signes, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible clementes, a Iesu Christ, and an ydoll: and some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, do take them but for bare signes, without any vertue or efficacie, estéeming them no more then they estéeme the common badges or cognisaunces that the seruauntes or soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours doe weare, for to declare what Lordes or maisters thei doe serue.</p>
               <p>And in this thing the Anabaptistes excéeded aboue al other: not onely in this, that thei would be baptized againe, but most
<pb facs="tcp:21676:48"/>
chiefly in that, that thei doe vtterly condemne the baptisme of yong children, and will haue it to be deferred, till they come to yeres of discretion, whose doctrine is no more to bee allowed, then the doctrine and opinion of them, that doe affirme that yong infantes that dye without baptisme, are euerlastyngly banished from the kyngdome of God.</p>
               <p>For, sith that the infantes are sanctified by the holy spirite of God, beyng washed in the blood of his onely begotten sonne our Sauiour Iesu christ, and comprehended in the couenaunt that he hath made with vs and our séede,<note place="margin">

Bicause forsooth that they doe not beleeue, nor be able yet to make any profession of their faith.</p>
               <p>What if I should reason after this forte: without faith it is impossible to please GOD, but litle infantes and babes doe please God,<note place="margin">

I might then conclude that they haue faith, though they cannot yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it outwardely.

               <p>It is to be noted then, that in <hi>Augustines</hi> tyme, many were exceedyng negligent about the sacramentes,<note place="margin">What caused the fathers to magnifie the Sacraments so muche.</note> which thing, hath caused the auncient fathers, to magnifie the same so muche.

               <p>There were many among them, that had receaued the Gospell, whiche did deferre to be baptized till the very houre of their death,<note place="margin">Uaine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie men.</note> some of them doyng it by negligence, and some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, bicause that thei were perswaded, that in baptisme, all the synnes that could be in man, should be washed awaie, for this cause, thei taried as long as they coulde, that so thei might depart out of this life, cleane and pure from all synnes: yea, many (whiche thyng was worse) did take, vpon that hope, the greater boldenesse to synne.

               <p>As they then that were of age, did deferre and prolong their baptisme: so it is not to be doubted, but that thei did the like in their owne children, for the causes aboue rehearsed.

               <p>Whosoeuer was then aucthour of this booke, he had a good cause to aggrauate or set foorth to the vttermost, this naturall corruption, and to saie, that not onely they that be of age, but also the very infantes and children, are euen from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, guiltie of euerlasting damnation, when thei die without Baptisme, if he doe vnderstande by it the grace and mercie of God, and the pourgyng that we haue in the blood of our sauiour Iesu Christe, whiche by baptisme is signified and represented vnto vs, and also communicated vnto the chosen and elect of God.</p>
               <p>And verely I thinke that he did so vnderstande it. For, if he will, after the rigour of the letter, take there, baptisme for the visible signe and outwarde ceremonie, I would in no wise hold with hym, sith that he alledgeth no sufficient auctorities of the scriptures, for to proue and confirme this saiyng of his, which is both so rigorous and so repugnaunt vnto the goodnesse and
<pb facs="tcp:21676:51"/>
grace of God, as it hath been already sufficiently proued: But I doe rather iudge, that he doeth vnderstande by baptisme, the vertue and efficacie of the blood of Christe, whiche is signified and represented vnto vs, by the visible signe and outwarde ceremony: wherby, neuerthelesse is signified and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the whole vertue of the true baptisme of Christe, after the phrase and maner of speaking, that the Scripture is wont to vse.<note place="margin">The signe &amp; the figure manye tymes are taken for the thinges that they doe signifie. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Actes.</hi> 8.</note> For in it the signe and the figure, are many tymes taken for the thynges, that are signified and represented, bicause that the scripture doeth moste chiefly speake vnto the faithfull, which do not receiue the sacramentes in vaine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirituall thyng, that is represented by them: And therefore the Apostle saieth: all ye that are baptized, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, or clothed with Christe.</p>

                  <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized outwardly by Philip, and yet I doe not beleeue, that euer he had put on our sauiour Christe, and that he was apparelled with him.

               <p>As then the resurrection of Christe, whereby he did rise

As for an example: our sauiour Christ hath been conceaued by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoste, borne of the virgine Marie, he hath been crucified, and put to death, he did rise againe the thirde daie, and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen.

               <p>Now, it is vnpossible that they that be thus dead vnto the worlde, should not liue vnto God, and that the worlde shoulde not be dead vnto them.

               <p>Whiche thyng they will confesse (excepte that they will affirme with <hi>Martion</hi>) that Christe had a phantasticall bodie,<note place="margin">Martions heresie.</note> whiche appeared outwardely to be a very mans body, and yet was none.<note place="margin">Eutiches heresie.</note> Or, except thei wil saie with <hi>Eutiches,</hi> that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of christ is deified or tourned into the godhead.

what sort this body of Christe, whiche lacketh nothing to the perfection of an humaine body, shoulde be in such a small péece of bread.

               <p>But let them drinke water styll with the Swannes of <hi>Thamesis,</hi> tyll they haue proued their monstrous doctrine by the word of God, or by any aucthoritie of the auncient fathers of the true Catholike Churche, and then I warrant that they shall neuer go drunken to bed.</p>
               <p>Yea, they are not ashamed to say, that in the Sacrament, the body of Christe doth occupie no place, and yet they wyll haue there, the same selfe body that was borne of the virgin, that hong on the crosse, and that ascended vp into heauen.

               <p>Likewise in the same booke, we finde written, that when <hi>Herode</hi> would haue brought foorth <hi>Peter,</hi> for to put hym to death, the angell of the Lorde did come vnto hym, as he slept betweene twoo souldiours, bounde with two chaines, and the keepers that watched and warded the prison,<note place="margin">The angell smote Peter on the side.</note> standyng with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out before the doores.

that Christ is one in substaunce with the father.<note place="margin">

For, there they shall learne, that whereas God in times past diuersly and many wayes spake vnto the fathers by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.</note> he did in these last dayes speake vnto vs by his sonne. It is not vnknowen to them that reade the Scriptures, that the spirite of Christe was in the prophetes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> and that by him God spake vnto the fathers.</p>
               <p>Howe shall we then vnderstande this place to the Hebrues, where he saith, that God did in these last daies, spake vnto vs by his sonne, sith that he did before speake vnto the fathers by him? It is to be vnderstanded and marked, that it is sayd, that God did speake vnto the fathers by his sonne,<note place="margin">Howe the place of Paul must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded.</note> because that the spirite of Christe was in all the prophetes, by whom he spake vnto the fathers: but in these latter dayes, God did speake vnto vs by his sonne, being incarnated: that is to say, beyng made man, and hauyng taken vpon him a mortall body in the virgins wombe. As then he did speake vnto vs by his sonne, beyng made man, and hauyng taken our frayle nature vppon him: so his sonne, I meane our sauiour Christe, beyng man: that is to say, touchyng his manhoode, and not touchyng his Godheade, is the image or figure of his substaunce. For the image or figure of a thing, must be visible and apparaunt to the eye, else it can not be called an image or a figure. But the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or diuine substaunce of Christ, coulde not be séen no more than the diuine substaunce of the father: therefore, he coulde not touching his Godhead or diuine substaunce, be the image or figure of his fathers substaunce, but onely touching his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie and manhoode. As he him selfe doth testifie, saying: He that séeth me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.</note> séeth the father.</p>
               <p>And it ought to séeme no straungenesse that we say, that Christe touching his humanitie or manhoode, is the image or figure of the father. For, if the first <hi>Adam,</hi> whiche notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> the holy scriptures doe testifie of vs, that when we be regenerated or borne a newe, we are the image of God: And shal not he, by whose spirite and worde, we are begotten a newe and regenerated, be most liuely and most effectuously the image of the fathers substaunce? Thus then may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as God did in these last daies, speake vnto vs by his sonne, beyng made man, or hauyng taken vpon hym a mortall body: so his sonne beyng man, or touching his manhoode, is the image of his diuine substaunce. But no man will saie, that Christe touchyng his humanitie or manhoode is one with the father in substaunce (for that were to affirme that the father is a creature) Therefore, the argument that they make vppon this te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And though thei would maintaine still, that this place must be vnderstanded of his diuitie and Godhead, yet shoulde they winne nothyng by it.

               <p>Nowe, if the papistes wyll gather of the wordes by them recited, that there is neither bread nor wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then we may aswel gather of the wordes that folowe, that there is neither Priest, nor Christes body: For, as in the former sentence, <hi>Chrisostome</hi> saieth, that we maye not thinke that we see bread and wine: so in the seconde sentence

he saith, that we may not thinke that we receaue the body of Christ of the priestes handes.</p>
               <p>Nowe if vpon the seconde sentence (the papistes will say) it can not be truely gathered, that in the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion there is not the body of Christe ministred by the Priest: then must they confesse also, that it can not be well and truely gathered vpon the first sentence, that there is no bread nor wine.

<pb facs="tcp:21676:103"/>
we speake vnto the father: our eye, wherewith we sée the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: our right hande, whereby we offer our selues vnto the father, without whose intercession, neither we nor all the saintes, haue ought to do with God. Do they not learne by the wordes of this auncient writer and father of the Church, that if we wyll speake vnto the father, Christe must be our mouth? If we wyll see the father, he must be our eye? Or if we wil offer our selues vnto the father, he must be our right hande? It is so farre of, that he shoulde appoynt any of the saintes, to be either our mouth, our eye, or our right hande, that rather he doeth boldly affirme, that except Christe doeth make intercession, all the saintes haue nothing to do with god. For why? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saieth: That as there is but one God of all, so there is but one mediatour betwixt God and man. These be his wordes:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> For there is one God, and one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt God and man, which is that man Christ Iesus, who gaue himselfe a raunsome for all men.</p>
               <p>Here we doe both sée and learne, that as there is but one God, so there is but one mediatour betwixt God and men, which is our sauiour Iesus Christ the only begotten sonne of God,<note place="margin">Why Christe our sauiour was man.</note> who was made man, for to set God and man at one, and for to make attonement betwixt them. For, when we wyll ioyne two thinges together, which do differ, or be of contrary natures, there must be some third thing, that doth approche &amp; holde of the nature of them both: or else there can be none at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, no agréement, nor true coniunction betwixt them, specially, if the natures be repugnaunt and contrary one vnto another. But what agréement can there be betwixt God and man? looke what agréement there can be, betwene consuming fire, and thornes, betweene light and darkenesse, betweene righteousnesse and vnrighteousnesse, betwéene blessyng and cursyng,<note place="margin">

               <p>Therefore it was most necessarie, that we should haue a mediatour for to make this agreement and coniunction, which mediatour shoulde bee partaker of both the natures, but yet

Likewise, we see, that christ is called the foundation, &amp; yet notwithstanding, the Apostles are called foundations also: why should not then the virgine Marie, and the sainctes be called Aduocates, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours, and intercessours, as well as our Sauiour Christe, though, it be not after one sorte and maner? Why ought men to bee offended, if folowyng the phrase of the scriptures, wee doe attribute vnto the blessed virgine Marie, and vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sainctes, the office of mediation, and intercession?</p>
               <p>As for the first,<note place="margin">Aunswere.</note> it is to bee vnderstanded, that our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

For, our sauiour Christ is the true and natural light of the worlde: but the Apostles are the light of the worlde,<note place="margin">why the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were called light.</note> onely by the denomination, or communication, that is to saie: the Apostles were not called the light, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because that thei were lightened, and deliuered from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by the light of our sauiour Christ. And for this cause the holy Apostle doeth call the Christians, light, when he saieth: Ye were in tymes paste darkenes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.</note> but now ye are light in the Lorde. Now, our sauiour Christ lighteneth no man, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this ende, that he should shine vnto other with good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as he him self sufficiently declareth,<note place="margin">

               <p>Also, Christe doeth geue this name to his Apostles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the office that he called them vnto, whiche was the preachyng of his holy Gospell, and of the worde of God, which in the scriptures is called light.

But when god doth take awaie this office from them, he doth also take awaie the name. In like maner now, the apostles are no more light: For, they be no more in place, where thei can shine vnto men by good workes, they be no more in the office of preachyng. I would faine that these greate learned doctours shoulde shewe mee a place in all the scriptures, wherein the wisdome of the

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21676:110"/>
the eyes of the ignoraunt people. Whiche séeme at the firste to be of some importaunce and waight, but if they be duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and tried with the touchestone of Gods worde, they shalbe founde to be méere deceytes. But, or I proceede any further,<note place="margin">What is the cheefe marke that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes doe shoote at.</note> I will shewe what their intent is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the chief and principal marke that they shoote at, is, to make themselues intercessours, aduocates, and mediatours betwixt the sainctes and vs. For, if we be once brought into that beléefe, that we may not come vnto Christe, nor direct our praiers vnto hym, excepte we haue the Sainctes for our mediatours, aduocates, and intercessours: wee shall also at length suffer our selues to be perswaded, that we are not worthy to praie our selues vnto the saintes, but that we must haue Monkes, Fréers, Nonnes, and Priestes for to be mediatours betwixt them and vs. And for this cause (as we see daiely by experience) doeth the poore simple, and ignoraunt people, bryng Golde and Siluer vnto them, euen as thei that haue any thyng to doe in the Lawe, be wont to offer giftes and presentes vnto Lawyers, for to haue their matter to be discussed and heard.</p>
               <p>Whereby we may knowe and see,<note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse of priestes, is the mother of all idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> what the offpryng and originall of the inuocation of Sainctes is. And that the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes of Priestes, is the mother and Nurce of all Idolatrie and superstition. I do not denie but that we haue a commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to praie one for a nother, whiles wee are yet in this life,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> but yet we ought not to make marchaundise of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or to thynke that they can haue any effect,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</note> but only by the intercession of our Sauiour Iesu Christe, or that we muste di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to any other, but to hym onely, for to haue them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto the father. For, we haue neither commaundement nor example in all the Scriptures, that we shoulde direct our praiers vnto dead Sainctes. For, it might be, that we shoulde call vpon many, whom, we knowe not whether thei be Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes or not, or whether they be in Heauen, or in Hell. But we are sure that our Sauiour Christe is in heauen.</p>
               <p>Againe, although we were neuer so sure that they bee in Heauen,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Esai.</hi> 63.</note> For, we learne rather the contrary in the Scriptures then otherwise. But he whom we ought to direct our praiers vnto, muste haue all these properties, yea, we must be assured and certified in our consciences, that hee hath them:<note place="margin">What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties must be in him that we must pray vnto.</note> els we shall neuer be quiet in our myndes. Firste, he muste bee of power and ablenesse to helpe and ayde vs: I meane, to graunt vs our petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and request. For what should it auaile vnto vs to praie vnto one, that were not able to helpe and aide vs. Secondly, he must be willyng to helpe, aide, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> succour vs. For what profite were it vnto vs, if he were able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to helpe vs a thousande tymes: if he woulde not doe it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he must be such a one, as can heare our praiers, when so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be made. For, what shoulde benifite vs, though he were neuer so able to ayde and helpe vs: if he could not heare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our praiers? what could also, his good will helpe vs? Fourthly, hee muste be of abilitie to heare the praiers of all men in the worlde, though thei should all praie together in one instaunce, and minute of an houre. For, else he might bee letted from hearyng of our praiers by the praiers of other men: and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes we should praie in vaine, bicause that geuyng eares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to the petitions of other men, he could not heare vs. Last of al, he must be such a one as knoweth better our neede &amp; necessitie, then we our selues are able to declare. But where shall we finde any, either in heauen or in earth, that hath all these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, but God alone, and his sonne Iesus Christ our Lorde? Therefore, I maye boldly conclude, that we ought to directe our petitions and praiers onely to God, and to his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne our Lorde and sauiour, who is the onely meane and waie for to come vnto God the father.<note place="margin">

First, they do great wrong and iniurie vnto God, when they do liken him vnto an earthly prince or tyraunt of the worlde: For, the causes why wee maie not come vnto the princes, and rulers of earth, when soeuer we would, without mediatours or meanes, can not bee founde in hym, nor yet in him sonne Iesus Christe our Lorde: And therefore this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, can helpe their matter nothyng at all.</p>
               <p>The princes, and rulers of the earth, if thei bee good, and louers of equitie and iustice, thei haue many enemies that do daiely conspire their death. And therefore, is not lawfull for euery man that would, for to come bluntly vnto theim, least vnder a pretensed matter, thei should be traiterously murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and slaine.

But no suche thyng can there be founde in our heauenly kyng and lorde, For, dwellyng in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aboue, he laugheth all his enemies to scorne, and hath them all that rise against hym,<note place="margin">

               <p>But put the case thei coulde proue that the sainctes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng our necessities, doe praie for vs, yet it should not folowe, that we ought to praie to them, or to make them our interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and aduocates, sith that we haue no suche commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the scriptures, nor yet is there any example, either of the Patriarches, Prophetes, or the Apostles of our Sauiour Iesus Christe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 8.</note> The Scriptures doe certifie vs, in certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Aungels doe praie for the elect people of GOD, and that they doe also offer our praiers vnto hym: yet ought we in no wise to praie vnto them. For why? they can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng but that, that God commaundeth them to doe: yea no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng will they doe, without his commaundement.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we will haue them to ayde and assiste vs, we must direct our praiers, vnto god alone, desiring and beseching his diuine maiestie that he vouchesafe to commaunde his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels to ayde and succour vs in all our necessities &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And then the blessed Angels, hauing a commaundement or commission of God, for to doe it, wyll most gladly and most diligently assiste and helpe vs, but we may not desire God, to comaunde the dead Sainctes to doe the same: bicause that thei be not appointed and ordeined thereto, as the angels are. The dead sainctes haue performed their course. For, vnto men it is not geuen of God, to helpe one another, but onely in this life present, whiles they be yet in this transitorie worlde, whiche thyng sainct <hi>Paule</hi> doeth well declare, saiyng:</p>

For, it is written in their owne Canon lawes, <hi>Iniuriam facit Martyri, qui orat pro Martyre</hi>: That is to saie, he doth wrong vnto a Martyr that praieth for a Martyr. Secondly, we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to pray one for another, that we may be saued: that is to saie, whiles we are yet in the waie of saluation, that we maie come to our waies ende. It appeareth by this, that it is not the will of God that we shoulde praie one for another, but onely whiles we are in this worlde, that so we maie exercise the workes of charitie, whiles we haue tyme as it is saide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

Why, say thei, should <hi>Ieremiah</hi> speake so of the dead, excepte be knewe that they did make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the liuyng? I maie a greate deale better reason after this maner:<note place="margin">Aunswere.</note> Sith that neither <hi>Moyses</hi> nor <hi>Samuell</hi> did praie for the people of Israell, it appeareth that there was then no intercessour of the dead. For, who of all the Sainctes shoulde haue taken thought for the people, if <hi>Moyses</hi> did not, who in this thing did exceede and passe all men, whiles he did liue? Therefore, thus I saie, I might make my argument againste them: In the extreame necessitie of the people, <hi>Moyses</hi> did make no intercession for them. It is most likely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that none at al did make intercession for them, sith that <hi>Moyses</hi> did passe all men in humanitie, gentlenesse, and mercie.</p>
               <p>The meanyng of the Prophete then is this:<note place="margin">What was the meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete.</note> that God was so offended with the people, that he woulde not spare them, though <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Samuell,</hi> whose praiers he was want to heare aboue all other, should make intercession for them. The
<pb facs="tcp:21676:119"/>
like in a maner haue we in the Prophete <hi>Ezechiell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.</note> where the Lorde speaketh on this maner: If <hi>Noah, Daniell,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> were in the Citie, as truely as I liue, they shall deliuer ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sonnes nor daughters, but saue their owne soules in their righteousnesse. As if he should saie: though <hi>Noah, Daniell,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> were then aliue againe, thei should not deliuer their owne sonnes and daughters, but should saue onely their owne liues in their righteousnes: my wrath and indignation is so kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against that stiffenecked people.</p>
               <p>And so the afore alledged place of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded. For, the wordes are as muche, as if he should saie: Though <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Samuell</hi> were nowe aliue, and shoulde stande before me, makyng intercession for this people, as thei were wont to doe, yet would I not for their sakes withdrawe my plagues from this wicked and frowarde generation: I woulde not heare them, nor geue eare vnto their praiers, but woulde in my furie vtterly destroie this rebellious and stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked people. Reade and marke diligently the circumstaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of both places, and ye shall finde that it is the true sence and meanyng of them.</p>
               <p>As for the place that thei doe bryng out of <hi>Genesis,</hi> saiyng: that <hi>Iacob</hi> doth pray,<note place="margin">

And therefore, whensoeuer the faithfull Israelites did make their praiers vnto God, they did alwaies beseche hym, to remember his seruauntes, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> puttyng hym in remembraunce of the couenaunte wherein he had promised, that he woulde for <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacbos</hi> sake, shewe mercie &amp; fauour vnto them. But howe litle they dystruste in the merites and intercessions of their forefathers, it is easy to see, in the prophete <hi>Esay,</hi> for there the

Therefore be at one with vs againe for thy Seruauntes sake, that are of the generation of thine heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>To be shorte, whensoeuer they did name in their praiers, their forefathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> it was not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helpe that they looked to haue at their handes, but for to put God in remembraunce of the couenaunt that he had made with them, and with their posteritie for euer. But nowe that we haue our Sauiour Iesus Christe, in whose blood the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt is both established and sealed vp: In whose name should we set foorth or offer vp our praiers vnto God, but in his only? Moreouer, that same maner of phrase that <hi>Iacob</hi> did vse, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times founde in the scriptures,<note place="margin">

Uerely, sithe that fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeres afore that Isaac was borne, Abrahams faith was imputed vnto hym for righteousnesse, it was impossible that he should be iustified by the offryng of his sonne Isaac, whiche was, as I sayd before, thirtie yeres after. That that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle goeth aboute here, is onely to shewe, that the faith which Abraham was iustified by, was no idle or deade faithe, but suche a faithe as made hym obedient vnto God, as it is plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth to the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">

               <p>Therefore, if the circumstaunces bee considered, there is no repugnaunce or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie in the doctrine of the Apostles at all. For, what contrarietie or repugnaunce could there bee in their doctrine, sithe that they were bothe led by one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite? Therefore, we shall marke that the holie Apostle saincte Paule, in his Epistle to the Romaines, and to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, did dispute and reason against them which did attribute iustification to workes.<note place="margin">Note this diligently.</note> But saincte Iames did write againste them which did vtterly contempne, and despise good workes.</p>
               <p>And therefore, Paule sheweth the causes of our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Iames sheweth theffectes and fruites of the same. Paul declareth how we are iustified: Iames declareth how wee are knowen to bee iustified. Paule excludeth woorkes, as not the cause of our iustification: Iames approueth woorkes, as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes proceedyng of the same. Paul denieth that any good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,

can be in them that be not iustified: Iames affirmeth that they which be iustified, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in no wise be without good workes.</p>

               <p>So that wee maie easily see, that the offeryng vp of Isaac, is a testimonie of the faithe and righteousnesse of Abraham, he could not be iustified by it, but rather it was thereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was iustified alreadie.

               <p>But to the Romaines, he maketh the matter more plaine, when he saieth:<note place="margin">

Nam &amp; quecunque mihi sunt opera bona, abs te sunt:</hi> This onely I saie, this I praie, this I couet, despise not the workes of thine handes: Sée thyne owne woorke in me, and not myne. For, if thou seeste myne, thou doest condempne. If thou seeste thyne owne, thou crowneste. For, all the good workes that I haue, thei are of thee. And therefore it was not without a cause, that <hi>Barnarde</hi> saied, that his merite, is the mercie of the Lorde, which place we haue before alledged:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Barnard. super cant. Serm.</hi> 61.</note> Here wee maie see that God doeth onely rewarde or crowne in vs, that which is his owne: so he doth condemne all that he findeth to be our owne.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I would that men, puttyng a side all wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, would once consider with them selues, that the maiestie of GOD, hath neede of none of vs, nor of any thyng we haue: but rather doeth giue vs all thynges aboundauntly,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</note> to enioye them. What good worke then can we doe, whereby wee maie profite hym in any thyng, or doe hym any good? <hi>Bonorum meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non eges.</hi> Thou haste no neede of my gooddes (saieth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) what merite I praie you,<note place="margin">

Or rather, whereof the whole profite (if there bee any) doeth redounde vpon our selues? He that is righteous, and doeth good woorkes, he doeth it not for any commoditie that God shall haue thereby (for what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie can God haue by any thing that we can doe?) But for his owne commoditie, as he whiche is wicked, and doeth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, hurteth hymself, and not God. He that hath the health of his body,<note place="margin">A similitude.</note> and doeth by good diet, kepe and preserue it, doeth he therefore deserue any rewarde at the Phisitions handes? I thinke not. For, he dooeth it not for the Phisitions profite, but for his owne.</p>
               <p>After the same sorte, he that by the gifte of God, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the health of his soule, and by his grace doeth the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that belong to the preseruation of the same, shall we saie that he doeth deserue any rewarde at Goddes handes, because that he is made suche by his gifte, and doeth now through his helpe, aide, and assistaunce, keepe the same grace, for his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profite and commoditie, either by earnest beliefe, or by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feined loue, or by assured hope, or by well doyng, and patience
<pb facs="tcp:21676:153"/>
in aduersitie and trouble.</p>
               <p>Who needeth with a rewarde, to bee stirred vp to drinke, when he is thirstie,<note place="margin">A rewarde neuer stirreth vp the godly to seeke for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> or to eate, when he is hungerie? Neither neede men, if they hungred and thristed for righteousnesse (as thei ought to doe) a rewarde to stirre them vp to it. A mother vseth not to bee entised with rewardes, to giue sucke, to feede and care for her owne childe, that it perishe not.

               <p>Now, where all thynges ought to bee attributed vnto the grace of God, what is left for the merites of men? For, where grace is, there is no place lefte for merite, if we doe consider a right the nature, and propertie of merite (for the name of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ought to be abolished) the nature of merite is, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a iuste proportion and equall consideration,<note place="margin">What the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of merite is.</note> ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that which is giuen, and that which is taken: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the good thynges which wée looke for, and those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche we either suffer or dooe, there is no proportion, or equalitie. For so saith S. Paul, the passions, and afflictions of this life,<note place="margin">

               <p>Unto the nature of merite there is required, that that which is geuen, perteine vnto the giuer, and be not due vnto hym whiche receiueth it: but workes are not of our selues, for they are the gifte of God,<note place="margin">
