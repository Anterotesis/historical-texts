            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>THe ſullen night worn thredbare, when I lay,</l>
               <l>Expecting the approach of early day:</l>
               <l>Such Loyal thoughts did in my boſom rage,</l>
               <l>As drew my curſes on this factious Age:</l>
               <l>With tears I mourn'd our ſinking Countrey's fate,</l>
               <l>And ſhadow'd glory of the royal State.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Till ſlumbring at the laſt, a glim'ring light,</l>
               <l>Methought was ſhown to my myſterious ſight.</l>
               <l>When I deſcry'd a Treas'nous damn'd Cabal,</l>
               <l>Hells mounting Engins that would ſink us all,</l>
               <l>And riſe upon our King's and Countreys fall:</l>
               <l>Dark were their looks, and knowingly I ſaw,</l>
               <l>Villains they were, and ſuch as fled the Law;</l>
               <l>Printers, and thoſe who had abus'd the times,</l>
               <l>Religion was their Cloak to hide their Crimes.</l>
               <l>Envious as Fiends, like Hells Divan they ſate;</l>
               <l>What would Hell more? to ruin Church and State:</l>
               <l>So vile as theſe, it never could appear,</l>
               <l>Had the great Whig-land Lucifer been there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When in an abrupt voice I heard one cry,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Romes Idol-York</hi> ſhan't gorge our Liberty.</l>
               <l>Rowze up my Friends, our Ruin's more than fear'd,</l>
               <l>Their Bulls do roar ſo loud we can't be heard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With that he paus'd—then ſaid with much diſtreſs</l>
               <l>What ſhall we do? The Tyde of our Succeſs,</l>
               <l>Now ſeems to Ebb, nor can we hope for leſs:</l>
               <l>For even thoſe, will now believe no more</l>
               <l>Our Shams, who judg'd them Miracles before.</l>
               <l>Intereſt's our Hook, and Freedom is the Bait,</l>
               <l>Bondage but nam'd, you'l ſee Rebellion ſtrait.</l>
               <l>Each weak Pretence deceives the eaſie crowd;</l>
               <l>With them 'tis Law, what is by us allow'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ſhallow are our Plots to ſearching eyes,</l>
               <l>They ſee what miſchief at the bottom lies:</l>
               <l>Our Shrieffs and Jurys for their Ends-applauſe,</l>
               <l>With Ignoramus, Riots, prop our Cauſe;</l>
               <l>They doubt of Peace from thoſe that break the Laws;</l>
               <l>There our deſigns are deſp'rate, and ſo croſt,</l>
               <l>Bold the attempt muſt be to gain what's loſt:</l>
               <l>Zealous Rebellion muſt ſecure us all;</l>
               <l>We cannot fail while we pretend a Call,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With that like Fiends they Vaniſh'd and I woke,</l>

               <l>O Wretched Land! how prov'd thy curing Vain?</l>
               <l>Sine thy old Wound is breaking out again,</l>
               <l>The whole's endanger'd by th' infected part,</l>
               <l>But Heaven inſtruct our great Phyſician's art.</l>
               <l>There's one way left to heal this deſp'rate wound;</l>

               <l>Were there no cauſe for this now needful blow,</l>
               <l>Religious Peace then through the Land would flow,</l>
               <l>So <hi>Jehu Sion</hi> purg'd, and Faith did grow.</l>
               <l>But let's Unite with pious joy to ſing,</l>
               <l>Health to the Beſt—to <hi>Englands</hi> gracious King.</l>
