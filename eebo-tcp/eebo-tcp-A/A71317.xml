            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>S r. Francis Bacon Knight,</hi> His <hi>Majesties</hi> Sollicitor generall, in the Case of the POST-NATI of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> before the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> and all the Iudges of England.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>May it please Your Lord-ships,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis Case Your Lord-ships doe well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be of exceeding' great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For whether you doe measure that by place, that reacheth not onely to the Realme of England, but to the whole Iland of Great-Brytaine; or whether you measure that by time, that extendeth not onely to the present time, but much more to future generations,
<q>
                  <hi>Et natinatorum, et qui nascentur ab illis:</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore as that is to receive at the barre a full and free debate: so I doubt not but that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from your Lord-ships a sound and iust resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to law and according to truth. For my Lords, though he were thought to have said well that said that for his word, <hi>Rex fortissimus;</hi> Yet he was hought to have said better, evenin the opinion ofa King him selfe that said, <hi>Veritas fortissima et pravalet.</hi> And I doe much rejoyce to observe such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in the whole carriage of this cause, to this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:130509:8"/>
end that truth may prevaile. The case no fained, or framed case; but a true case betweene true partyes.</p>
            <p>The title handled formerly in some of the Kings Courts, and Free-hold upon it: used indeed by his Majesty, in his high wisedome to give an end to this great question, but not raysed: <hi>occasio,</hi> as the Schoole-men say, <hi>arrepta non porrecta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The case argued in the Kings Bench by <hi>M. Walter</hi> with great liberty, and yet with good approbation of the Court. The persons assigned to be of Counsell on that side, inferiour to none of their quality and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in learning; and some of them most conversant and exercised in the question.</p>
            <p>The Iudges in the Kings Bench have adjourned it to this place, for conference with the rest of their brethren. Your Lord-ship, my Lord Chancellor, though you be absolute Iudg in the Court where you sit, and might have called to you such assistance of <hi>Iudges</hi> as to you had seemed good: yet would not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run or leade in this case by any opinion there to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but have chosen rather to come your selfe to this assembly, all tending (as I sayd) to this end, whereunto I for my part doe heartily subscribe, <hi>ut vincat veritas,</hi> that truth may first appeare, and then prevaile. And I doe firmely hold and doubt not but I shall well maintaine, that this is the truth, That <hi>Calvin</hi> the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiefe is <hi>Ipso Iure</hi> by the law of England a naturall borne subject, to purchase Free-hold and to bring reall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within <hi>Eugland.</hi> In this case I must so consider the time, as I must much more consider the matter. And therefore though it may draw my speach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to further length; yet I dare not handle a case of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:130509:8"/>
nature confusedly, but purpose to observe the ancient and exact forme of pleadings, which is,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>First, to explaine or induce.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Then, to confute, or answere objections.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>And lastly, to prove, or confirme.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And first for explanation. The outward question in this case is no more, but whether a child borne in <hi>Scotland</hi> since his Majesties happy comming to the Crowne of England, be naturalized in <hi>England</hi> or no? But the inward question or State of the question e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore beginneth, where that which is confessed on both sides doth leave.</p>
            <p>It is confest, that if these two Realmes of <hi>England</hi> and Scotland were united under one Law and one Parliament, and thereby incorporated and made as one Kingdome, that the <hi>Post-natus</hi> of such an union should be naturalized.</p>
            <p>It is confessed, that both Realmes are united in the person of our Soveraigne; or (because I will gaine no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing by surreption, in the putting of the question) that one &amp; the same naturall person, is King of both Realmes.</p>
            <p>It is confessed, that the Lawes and Parliaments are severall. So then, whether this priviledge and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Naturalization be an accessory or dependancy up on that which is one and joint, or upon that which is severall, hath beene and must be the depth of this question. And therefore your Lord-ships doe see the State of this question doth evidently lead me by way of inducement to speake of three things. The King, the Law, and the priviledge of Naturalization. For
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:130509:9"/>
if you well understand the nature of the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, and againe the nature of the Accessory; Then shall you discerne, to whether Principal the Accessory doth properly referre, as a shadow to a body, or Iron to an Adamant.</p>
            <p>And there your Lord-ships will give me leave in a case of this quality, first to visit and open the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fountaines of Reason; and not to begin with the positions, and eruditions of a <hi>Municipall</hi> Law; for so was that done in the great Case of Mines; and so ought that to be done in all cases of like nature. And this doth not at all detract from the sufficiency of our lawes, as incompetent to decide their owne cases; but rather addeth a dignity unto them when their reason appearing as well as their authority, doth shew them to be as fine moneyes, which are currant not onely by the stampe because they are so received, but by the naturall metall, that is the reason and wisedome of them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Master Littleton</hi> himselfe in his whole booke doth commend but two things to the professors of the law by the name of his sonnes; the one the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and searching out the reasons of the law, and the other, the observing of the formes of pleadings. And never was there any case that came in Iudgement, that required more that <hi>Littletons</hi> advice should be followed in those two points, then doth the present case in question. And first of the King.</p>
            <p>It is evident that all other common-wealths (Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies onely excepted) doe snbsist by a law preceedent. For where authority is divided amongst many offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and they not perpetuall, but annuall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:130509:9"/>
and not to receive their authority but by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and certaine persons to have voice onely to that election, and the like: These are busie and curious frames: which of necessity doe presuppose a law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent written or unwritten to guide and direct them. But in Monarchies, especially hereditary, that is when severall families, or Ilneages of people doe submit themselves to one line, Imperiall or Royall, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is more naturall and simple, which afterwards by lawes subsequent is perfected and made more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall: but that is grounded upon nature. That this is so, it appeareth notably in two things, the one, the platformes and patternes which are found in nature of Monarchies, the original submissions, &amp; their motives and occasions. The platformes are three.</p>
            <p>The first is that of a father, or chiefe of a family: who governing over his wife by prerogative of Sexe, over his children by prerogative of age, and because he is author unto them of being; and over his servants by prerogative of vertue and providence, for he that is able of body, and improvident of mind, is <hi>Natura servus</hi>) that is a very modell of a King. So that is the opinion of <hi>Aristotle, Lib. 3. Pol. Cap. 14,</hi> where he saith: <hi>Verum autem regnum est, cum penes unum est rerum summa potestas: quod regnum procurationem familia imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Lyeurgus,</hi> when one counselled him to dissolve the kingdome and to establish another forme of estate, he answered, Sir begin to doe that which you advise first at home in your owne house noting that the chief of a family is as a King; and that those that can least endure Kings abroad; can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:130509:10"/>
to be Kings at home, &amp; this is the first platforme, which we see is meerely naturall.</p>
            <p>The second is, that of a Shepheard and his flocke; which <hi>Zenophon</hi> saith, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ever in his mouth. For shepheards are not owners of the sheepe, but their office is to feede and governe: no more are Kings, <hi>proprietaries,</hi> or owners of the people, for God is sole owner of people. The nations, as the Scripture saith, are his inheritance: But the office of Kings is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, maintaine, and protect people. And that is not without a mystery, that the first King that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God, <hi>David,</hi> (for <hi>Saul</hi> was butan untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruit) was translated from a shepheard, as you have it in the 78. <hi>Psal. Et elegit David servum suum, de gregibus ovium sustulit eum, pascere Iacob Servum suum Israel hereditatem suam.</hi> This is the second platforme, a worke likewise of nature.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>platforme</hi> is the government of God himselfe over the world, whereof lawfull <hi>Monarchies,</hi> are a shadow. And therefore both amongst the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and amongst the Christians the word (<hi>sacred</hi>) hath beene attributed unto Kings, because of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of a Monarchy, with the divine Majesty; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a Senate or people. And so you finde it twice in the Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Reports: once in the second booke, the Bishop of <hi>Winchesters</hi> case; and his first booke. <hi>Cawdries</hi> case, and more anciently in the 10. of <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fo.</hi> 18. <hi>Rex est persona mixta cam Sacerdote;</hi> an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which the senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> or a <hi>Canton of Swisses,</hi> can never challenge. So we see there be presidents, or platformes of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> both in <hi>Nature</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Nature:</hi> even from the Monarch of heaven and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:130509:10"/>
earth; to the King (if you will) in an hive of bees. And therefore other States are the creatures of the law; and this State onely subsisteth by <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the originall submissions, they are foure in number: I will briefly touch them: The first is <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> or <hi>Patriarchy,</hi> which was when a family grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so great as it could not containe it selfe within one habitation, some branches of the descendents were forced to plant themselves into new families, which second families could not by a naturall instinct, and inclination, but beare a reverence and yeeld an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyseance to the eldest line of the ancient family, from which they were derived.</p>
            <p>The second is, the admiration of vertue, or gratitude towards merit, which is likewise naturally infused into all men. Of this <hi>Aristotle</hi> putteth the case well, when it was the fortun of some one man, either to invent some Arts of excellent use towards mans life; or to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate people that dwelt scattered, into one place, where they might cohabite with more comfort; or to guide them from a more barrenland to a more fruitful, or the like: Vpon these deserts, and the admiration and recompence of them, people submitted themselves.</p>
            <p>The third, which was the most usuall of all, was Conduct in warre, which even in nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth as great an obligation, as <hi>Paternity.</hi> For as men owe their life and being to their <hi>Parents,</hi> in regard of generation: So they owe that also to <hi>Saviours</hi> in the warres, in regard of preservation. And therefore we finde in the 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the booke of <hi>Iudges, verse</hi> 22. <hi>Dixerunt omnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iri ad Cedeon Dominare nostri, tu et filij tui, quoniam servasti nos de manu Madian.</hi> And so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:130509:11"/>
we reade when it was brought to the <hi>eares</hi> of <hi>Saul that the people sung in the streets, Saul</hi> hath kild his <hi>thousand, &amp; David</hi> his <hi>ten thousand</hi> of enemies; he said straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: <hi>Quid ei superest nisi ipsum regnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> for whosoever hath the <hi>military dependance, wants little of being King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is an enforced submission, which is Conquest, whereof it seemed <hi>Nymrod</hi> was the first president, of whom it is said, <hi>Ipse caepit potens esse in terra, et erat robustus venator coram Domine.</hi> And this likewise is upon the same root, which is the saving or gift as it were of life, and being, for the Conqueror hath power of life and death over his Captives, and therefore where he giveth them themselves, he may reserve upon such a gift, what service and subjection he will. All these foure submissions are evident to be naturall and more ancient than law.</p>
            <p>To speake therefore of Law, which is the second part of that which is to be spoken of, by way of inducement. <hi>Law</hi> no doubt is the great Organ by which the soveraigne power doth move, and may be truly compared to the sinewes in a naturall body, as the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> may be compared to the spirits, for if the Sinewes be without the spirits, they are dead and without motion, If the spirits move in weake si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes it causeth trembling: so the lawes with out the <hi>Kings</hi> power, are dead; the <hi>Kings</hi> power except the lawes be corroborate, will never move constantly, but be full of staggering and trepidation. But towards the <hi>King</hi> himself, the law doth a double office or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: The first is to entitle the <hi>King,</hi> or designe him; and in that sense <hi>Bracton</hi> saith well. <hi>Lib. 1. fol. 5.</hi> and <hi>Lib. 3. fol. 107. Lex facit quod ipse sit Rex,</hi> that is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:130509:11"/>
it defines his title, as in our law, that the kingdome shall goe to the issue female: That it shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partable amongst daughters: That the halfe bloud shall not be respected, and other points differing from the rules of common inheritance. The second is (that whereof we need not feare to speake in good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py times, such as these are) to make the ordinary power of the King more definite or regular, for it was well said by a Father, <hi>plenitudo potestatis, est ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitudo tempest at is.</hi> And although the King, in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be <hi>Solutus Legibus;</hi> yet his Acts and Grants are limited by Law, and we argue them every day.</p>
            <p>But I demand, Do these offices or operations of law evacuate or frustrate the originall submission, which was naturall? or shall it be said that all allegiance is by law? No more than it can be said, that <hi>potest potest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris,</hi> the power of the Father over the Child, is by Law: and yet no doubt Lawes do diversely define of that also; the Law of some Nations having given Fathers power to put their Children to death; others, to sell them thrice, others to disinherit them by testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at pleasure, and the like. Yet no man will af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firm, that the obedience of the child is by law, though lawes in some points doe make it more positive. And even so it is of allegiance of subjects to hereditary <hi>Monarches,</hi> which is corroborate and confirmed by law, but is the worke of the law of nature. And therefore you shall finde the observation true, and almost generall in all states, that their law-givers were long after their first Kings, who governed for a time by naturall equity without law; So was <hi>Theseus</hi> long before <hi>Salo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

long before <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in <hi>Sparta.</hi> So was <hi>Romulus</hi> long before the <hi>Decemviri.</hi> And even amongst our selves, there were more ancient <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and yet the Lawes ran under the name of <hi>Edgars</hi> Lawes. And in the refounding of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> in the person of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, when the Lawes were in some confusion for a time, a man may truly say, that <hi>King Edward</hi> the first, was the first Law-giver, who enacting some Laws, and collecting others, brought the Law to some perfection. And therefore I will conclude this point with the Style which divers Acts of Parliaments do give unto the <hi>King:</hi> which terme him very effectually and truly, <hi>Our Naturall Sove, raigne Liege Lord.</hi> And as it was said by a principall Judge here present when he served in another place, and question was moved by some occasion of the title of <hi>Bulleins</hi> Lands: That he would never allow, that <hi>Queene Elizabeth.</hi> (I remember it for the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the phrase) should bee a Statute <hi>Queene,</hi> but a <hi>Common Law Queen:</hi> So surely I shall hardly consent, that the <hi>King</hi> shall be esteemed or called only, <hi>Our Rightfull Soveraigne,</hi> or <hi>Our Lawfull Soveraigne,</hi> but our Naturall Liege Soveraigne; As Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment speake: For as the common Law is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than the <hi>Statute Law:</hi> So the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> is more worthy than them both. Having spoken now of the <hi>King</hi> and the Law: it remaineth to speake of the priviledge and benefit of <hi>Naturalization</hi> it selfe, and that according to the rules of the Law of <hi>England. Naturalization</hi> is best discerned in the degrees where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Law doth mount and ascend thereunto. For it seemeth admirable unto mee, to consider with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:130509:12"/>
what a measured hand, and with how true poportions our Law doth impart and conferre the severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this benefit: The degrees are foure.</p>
            <p>The first degree of persons, (as to this purpose) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the Law takes knowledge of, is an Alien <hi>Enemy:</hi> that is such a one as is borne under the obeisance of a Prince or State that is in hostility with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> To this person the Law giveth no benefit or protection at all, but if hee come into the Realme after war proclaimed, or war in fact, he comes at his own perill, hee may be used as an enemy: For the Law accounts of him, but (as the Scripture saith) as of a <hi>Spye</hi> that comes to see the weaknesse of the land. And so it is 2. of <hi>Ric.</hi> the 3, fo. 2. Neverthelesse, this admitteth a distinction. For if he come with safe conduct, otherwise it is. For then he may not be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, either in person or goods. But yet hee must fetch his Justice at the fountaine head, for none of the Conduit pipes are open to him, he can have no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in any of the Kings Courts: but he must complain himselfe before the Kings Privy Councell: There he shall have a proceeding summary from houre to houre, the cause shall be determined by naturall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not by rules of <hi>Law,</hi> and the decree of the Councell shall be executed by ayde of the Chaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as is 13. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. An this is the first degree.</p>
            <p>The second person, is an Alien friend, that is such a one as is borne under the obeisance of such a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> as is confederate with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or at least not in war with him. To this person the Law allotteth this benefit, that as the Law accounts that the hold it hath over him, is but a tranfitory hold
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:130509:13"/>
(for he may be an <hi>Enemy</hi>) So the Law doth indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him, but with a transitory benefit, that is of moveable goods and personall actions. But for free-hold, or lease, or actions reall, or mixt: he is not inabled, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in <hi>auter droit</hi> And so it is 9, <hi>E.</hi> 4, fo. 7. 19. <hi>E.</hi> 4; fo. 6. 5. <hi>Ma.</hi> and divers other books.</p>
            <p>The third person is a <hi>Denizon,</hi> using the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; (for sometime it is confounded with a naturall borne subject.) This is one, that is but <hi>Subditus insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus,</hi> or <hi>adoptivus,</hi> and is never by birth, but only by the <hi>Kings</hi> Charter, and by no other meane; come he never so young into the Realme, or stay he never so long. Mansion or Habitation will not indenise him, no nor swearing obedience to the King in a Leete, which doth in-law the subject; but only (as I said) the <hi>Kings</hi> grace and gift. To this person the Law giveth an ability and capacity abridged, not in matter but in time. And as there was a time, when hee was not subject: So the Law doth not acknowledge him before that time. For if he purchase free-hold after his <hi>Denization,</hi> he may take it; but if he have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any before, he shall not hold it: So if hee have children after, they shall inherit, but if hee have any before, they shall not inherit: So as he is but privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>à parte post,</hi> as the Schoole-men say, and not <hi>à parte ante.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and last degree, is a <hi>Naturall</hi> borne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is evermore by birth, or by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and he is compleate and entire. For in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> there is <hi>nil ultra,</hi> there is no more subdivision or more subtile division beyond these: And therein it seemeth to mee that the wisdome of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130509:13"/>
the Law (as I said) is to be admired both ways, both because it distinguisheth so far, and because it doth not distinguish further. For I know that other Lawes do admit more curious distinction of this priviledge; For the <hi>Romanes</hi> had besides <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Civitatis,</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to <hi>Naturalization, Ius Suffragii.</hi> For although a man were naturalized to take lands and inheritance; yet he was not inabled to have a voyce at passing of Laws, or at election of Officers. And yet further they have <hi>Ius Petitionis,</hi> or <hi>Ius Honorum.</hi> For though a man had voyce, yet he was not capable of honour, and office. But these be the devises commonly of popular or free estates, which are jealous whom they take into their number, and are unfit for <hi>Monarchies:</hi> But by the Law of <hi>England</hi> the subject that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall borne, hath a capacity or ability to all benefits whatsoever; I say capacity or ability. But to reduce <hi>Potentiam in actum,</hi> is another case. For an <hi>Earle of Ireland,</hi> though he be naturalized in <hi>England,</hi> yet hath so voyce in Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> except he have either a call by Writ, or a creation by Patent, but he is capable of either. But upon this quadripartite divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ability of persons, I doe observe to your Lordships three things, being all effectually pertinent to the question in hand.</p>
            <p>The first is, that if any man conceive that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the <hi>Post-nati</hi> might serve as well for the <hi>Ante-nati;</hi> He may by the distribution which wee have made, plainly perceive his error. For the Law looketh not back, and therefore cannot by any matter <hi>ex post facto,</hi> after birth, after the state of the birth; wherein no doubt the Law hath a grave and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130509:14"/>
reason, which is this in few words, <hi>Nemo su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito fingitur; aliud est nasci, aliud fieri:</hi> Wee indeed more respect and affect thse worthy Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> whose merits and conversations we know: but the Law that proceeds upon generall reason and looks upon no mens faces, affecteth and priviledgeth those, which drew their first breath under the obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second point is, that by the former distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it appeareth that there be but two conditions by birth, either <hi>Alien</hi> or naturall borne (<hi>nam tertium peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ignor amus.</hi>) It is manifest then, that if the <hi>Post. nati</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be not naturall borne, they are alien born and in no better degree at all, than <hi>Flemmings, French, Italians, Spanish, Germans,</hi> and others; which are all at this time <hi>Alien friends,</hi> by reason his Majesty is in peace with all the World.</p>
            <p>The third point seemeth to mee very worthy the consideration, which is, that in all the distribution of persons, and the degrees of abilities or capacities, the <hi>Kings</hi> Act is all in all, without any manner of respect to Law or Parliament. For it is the <hi>King,</hi> that makes an <hi>Alien</hi> enemy, by proclaiming a war, wherewith the Law, or Parliament intermeddles not: So the <hi>King</hi> only grants Safe-conducts, wherewith Law and Parliament intermeddle not. It is the <hi>King</hi> likewise that maketh an <hi>Alien friend,</hi> by concluding a peace, wherewith Law and Parliament intermeddle not. It is the <hi>King</hi> that makes a Denizon, by his Charter abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of his prerogative and power, wherewith Law and Parliament intermedle not. And therefore it is strongly to be inferred, that as all these degrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:130509:14"/>
wholly upon the <hi>Kings</hi> act, and no wayes upon <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Parliament:</hi> So the fourth, although it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by the <hi>Kings Patent,</hi> but by operation of Law: yet that the law, in that operation, respecteth onely the <hi>Kings</hi> person, without respect of subjection to <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Parliament.</hi> And thus much by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and inducement: which being all matter in effect confessed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the strongest ground-worke to that which is contradicted or controverted.</p>
            <p>There followeth the confutation of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the contrary side.</p>
            <p>That which hath beene materially objected may be reduced to foure heads.</p>
            <p>The first is, that the priviledge of <hi>Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> followeth <hi>Allegeance,</hi> and that <hi>allegeance</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is drawne from that common ground, <hi>Cum duo jura concarrunt in una persona, aquum est, ac si essent in duobus;</hi> a rule, the words whereof are taken from the Civill Law; but the matter of it is received in all lawes; being a very line or rule of reason to avoyd confusion.</p>
            <p>The third consisteth of certaine inconveniencies conceived to ensue of this generall naturalization <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is not properly an objection, but a preoccupation of an objection or proofe on our part, by a distinction devised betweene Countries devolute by descent, and acquired by <hi>Conquest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, it is not properly to observe that those which maintaine this new opinion, whereof there is <hi>altum Silentium</hi> in our bookes of Law, are not well
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:130509:15"/>
agree in what forme to utter and expresse that: for some said that allegeance hath respect to the Law, some to the Crowne, some to the Kingdome, some to the body politique of the King, so there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of tongues amongst them, as it commonly commeth to passe in opinions, that have their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in subtilty, and imagination of mans wit, and not in the ground of nature. But to leave their words and to come to their proofes, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove this conceipt, by three manner of proofes. First by reason, then by certaine inferences out of Statutes, and lastly, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine booke-cases mentioning and reciting the formes of pleadings.</p>
            <p>The reason they bring is this; That Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization is an operation of the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and so indeed it is, that may bee the true <hi>genus</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Then they adde (that granted) that the Law of <hi>England</hi> is of force onely within the Kingdome and Dominions of <hi>England,</hi> and cannot operate, but where it is in force. But the Law is not in force in <hi>Scotland,</hi> therefore that cannot endure this benefit of Naturalization by a birth in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reason is plausible and sensible, but extreamely erronious. For the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for matters of benefit, or forfeitures in <hi>England,</hi> operateth over the World. And because it is truely said, that <hi>Respublica conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:130509:15"/>
poena, &amp; praemio.</hi> I will put a case or two of either.</p>
            <p>It is plaine that if a Subject of <hi>England</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired the death of the King in forraine parts, it was by the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> treason. How prove I that? By the Statute of 35. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. ca. 2. wherein you shall find no words at all of making any new case of treason which was not treason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but onely of ordaining a forme of triall, <hi>Ergo</hi> it was treason before. And if so, then the Law of <hi>England</hi> workes in forraine parts. So of contempts, if the King send his Privy Seale to any Subject beyond the Seas, commanding him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and hee disobey; no man will doubt, but there is a contempt, and yet the fact endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the contempt was committed in forraine parts.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Law of <hi>England,</hi> doth extend to Acts or matters done in forraine parts. So of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Priviledge or benefit wee need seeke no other instance; then the instance in question, for I will put you a case that no man shall deny, where the Law of <hi>England</hi> doth worke and conferre the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Naturalization upon a birth neither within the Dominions of the Kingdome, nor King of <hi>England.</hi> By the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. which, if you will beleeve <hi>Hussey,</hi> is but a Declaration of the Common Law, all children borne in any parts of the World, if they be of <hi>English</hi> Parents, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing at that time, as liege Subjects to the King, and having done no act to forfeit the benefit of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:130509:16"/>
their allegeance are <hi>ipso facto</hi> naturalized. Nay if a man looke narrowly into the Law in this point, he shall find a consequence, that may seeme at the first strange, but yet cannot well be avoided; which is that it divers Families of English-men and women plant themselves at <hi>Middleborough</hi> or at <hi>Roane,</hi> or at <hi>Lysoone,</hi> and have issues, and their deseendents doe intermarry, amongst themselves without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of forraine blood; such descendents are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized to all generations, for every generation is still of liege Parents, and therefore naturalized. So as you may have whole tribes, and lineages of <hi>English</hi> in forraine Countries.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is utterly untrue that the Law of <hi>England</hi> cannot operate, of conferre naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely within the bounds of the Dominions of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come now to their inferences upon Statutes. The firstis out of this Statute which J last recyted. In which Statute it is said, that in foure severall places, there are words; borne within the allegeance of <hi>England;</hi> or againe borne without the allegeance of <hi>England,</hi> which (say they) applies the allegeance to the Kingdome, and not to the person of the King. To this the answer is easie: for there is not trope of speech more familiar then to use the place of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the person. So we say commonly the lyne of <hi>Yorke,</hi> or the lyne of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> for the lynes of the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> or the Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we say the possessions of <hi>Sommerset</hi> or <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick</hi> intending the possessions of the Dukes of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset,</hi> or Earles of <hi>Warmick.</hi> So we seeEarles signe, <hi>Salisbury, Northampton,</hi> for the Earles of <hi>Salisbury</hi> or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:130509:16"/>
               <hi>Northampton.</hi> And in the very same manner, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute speakes, allegeance of <hi>England,</hi> for allegeance of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Nay more if there had been no variety in the penning of that Statute, this collect - on had had a little more force, for those words might have beene thought, to have been used of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and in propriety; but you may find in three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther severall places of the same Statute, <hi>Allegeange</hi> and <hi>obeysance</hi> of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and specially in the materiall and concluding place, that is to say, children whose Parents were at the time of their birth, at the faith and <hi>obeysance</hi> of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so that is manifest by this indifferent and indifferent use of both Phrases, the one proper, the other unproper, that no man can ground any infere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce upon these words without danger of cavillation.</p>
            <p>The second Statute out of which they inferre, is a Statute made in 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ca.</hi> touching the policy of strangers trades men within this Realme. For the <hi>Parliament</hi> finding, that they did eate the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of trade, and that they entertained no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentizes, but of their o vne Nation, did prohibite that they should receive any. Apprentize, but the Kings Subjects. In which Statute is said, that in 9. severall places, there is to be found this context of words, <hi>Aliens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the Kings obedience;</hi> which is pregnant (say they) and doth imply that there bee <hi>Aliens</hi> borne within the Kings obedience. Touching this inference I have heard it said <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> the mosse of the barke. For it is evident that the Statute meant to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:130509:17"/>
speake clearely and without equivocation, and to a common understanding. Now then there are <hi>aliens</hi> in common reputation &amp; <hi>aliens</hi> in precise constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ofLaw, The Statute then meaning not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Irish</hi>-men, or <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sie</hi>-men, or <hi>Calize</hi>-men, for explanation sake, left the word <hi>alien</hi> might be extended to them in a vulgar acceptance, added those further words, borne out of the Kings obedience? Nay, what if we should say, that those words accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the received Lawes of Speech, are no words of difference or limitation, but of declaration or description of an <hi>alien,</hi> as if it had beene said with a <hi>videlicet, aliens;</hi> that is such as are borne out of the Kings obedience: they cannot put us from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. But sure I am, if the barke make for them, the pyth makes for us, for the Priviledge or liberty which the Statute meanes to deny to <hi>Aliens</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Apprentizes is denyed to none, borne within the Kings obedience, call them <hi>Aliens</hi> or what you will. And therefore by their reason a <hi>post-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> shall by that Statute keepe what stranger Apprentizes he will, and so is put in the degree of an <hi>English.</hi> The third Statute out of which inference is made, is the Statute of 14. <hi>E. 3. ca. solo,</hi> which hath been said to be our very case, and I am of that opinion too, but directly the other way, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to open the scope and purpose of that Statute. After that the title to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> was devolute to K. <hi>E. 3.</hi> &amp; that he had changed his Stile, changed his Armes, changed his Seale, (as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie hath done) the Subject of <hi>England</hi> (saith the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) conceived a feare that the Realme of <hi>England</hi> might become subject to the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> or to the K. as K. of <hi>France.</hi> And I will give you the reasons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:130509:17"/>
of the double feare, that it should become subject to the Realme of <hi>France</hi> they had this reason of feare: <hi>Normandy</hi> had conquered <hi>England; Normandy</hi> was feudall of <hi>France,</hi> therefore because the superiour Seignery of <hi>France</hi> was now united in right with the Tenancy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that <hi>England,</hi> in regard of the conquest might be taken as a perquisite to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> they had propable reason to feare, <hi>that the Kingdome of England might be drawne to be subject to the Realme of France.</hi> The other feare that <hi>England</hi> might become subject to the K. as K. of <hi>France</hi> grew no doubt of this fore-sight, that <hi>the Kings of England might be like to make their mansion and seate of their estate in France, in regard of the Climate, wealth, and glory of that Kingdome; and thereby the Kingdome of England might be governed by the Kings mandates and precepts issuing, as from the King of France.</hi> But they will say what soever the occasion was, here you have the difference authorised of subjection to a K. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and subjection to a King, as K. of a certaine King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but to this I give an answer three-fold.</p>
            <p>First, it preffeth not the question; for doth any man say that a <hi>Post-natus</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is naturalized in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> because he is a subject of the King, as K. of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> No, but generally, because he is the K. Subject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the scope of this Law is to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between Crown, and Crown; But the scope of their argument is to make a difference betweene Crowne and person. Lastly, this Statute (as I said) is our very case retorted against them, for this is a direct Statute of separation, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth that the Common Law had made an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Crownes in some degree, by vertue of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:130509:18"/>
vnion in the Kings person <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if this statute had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> beene made to stop &amp; crosse the course of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law in that point, as if <hi>Scotland</hi> now should be suitors to the King, that an Act might passe to like effect, and upon like feare. And therefore if you will make good your distinction, in this present case; shew us a Statute for that. But I hope you can shew no Statute of separation betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And if any man say, that this was a Statute declaratory of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law, he doth not marke how that is penned: for after a kind of Historicall declaration in the Preamble, that <hi>England</hi> was never subject to <hi>France,</hi> the body of the Act is penned thus: <hi>The King doth grant and establish,</hi> which are words meerly introductive <hi>novae legis</hi> as if the King gave a Charter of <hi>Franchise,</hi> and did invest by a <hi>Donative,</hi> the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> with a new Priviledge or exemption, which by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law they had not.</p>
            <p>To come now to the booke-cases which they put: which I will couple together because they receive one joynt answere.</p>
            <p>The first is 42. of <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>fo.</hi> where the booke saith: exception was taken that the plaintife was borne in <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>Rosse,</hi> out of the allegeance of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next is 22. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fo.</hi> 38. <hi>Adrians</hi> Case, where it is pleaded that a woman was borne at <hi>Burgis,</hi> out of the allegeance of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is 13. <hi>Eliz. Dyer fo.</hi> 300 where the case begins thus: <hi>Doctor Story qui notorie dignoscitur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>esse subditus regni Angliae.</hi> In all these three (say they) that is pleaded that the party is subject of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and not of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <p>To these bookes I give this answer, that they be not the Pleas at large, but the words of the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who speakes compendiously and narrative, and not according to the solemne words of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. If you find a case put, that it is pleaded, a man was seized in Fee. simple, you will not inferre upon that, that the words of the pleading were <hi>in fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay that further forme of pleading beateth downe your opinion. That it sufficeth not to say, that he is borne out of the <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of the King, and stay there, but he must shew in the affirmative under the <hi>allegeance</hi> of what King, or state he was borne. The Reason whereof cannot be because it may appeare, whether he be a friend or an enemy, for that in a reall action is all one: not it cannot be because issue shalbe taken thereupon; for the issue must arise on the other side upon <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digena</hi> pleaded and traversed. And therefore it can have no other reason, but to apprise the court more certainly, that the countrey of the birth is none of those, that are subject to the King. As for the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it should be impossible to de tryed; I hold it not worth the answering; for the <hi>ovenire facias,</hi> shall goe either where the naturall birth is laid, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be but by fiction, or if it be laid accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth, it shalbe tryed where the action is brought, otherwise you fall upon a maine: Rock, that breaketh your <hi>Argument</hi> in pieces, for how should the birth of an <hi>Irish-man</hi> be tryed, or of 2
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130509:19"/>
               <hi>Gersie</hi> man? Nay how should the birth of a subject be tryed that is borne of <hi>English Parents</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Florence,</hi> or any part of the world? for to all these the like objection of tryall may be made, because they are within no Counties, and this receives no answer. And therefore I will now passe on to the second maine <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a rule of the Civill Law, say they, <hi>cum duo jura, &amp;c.</hi> when two rights doe meete in one person there is no confusion of them, but they remain still in eye of law distinct, as if they were in severall persons, and they bring examples of one man Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of two Seas, or one person that is Rector of two Churches. They say this unity in the Bishop, or the Rector doth not create any privity between the Parishioners or Dioceseners, more then if there were severall Bishops, or severall Parsons. This rule I allow (as was said) to be a Rule not of the Civill Law onely, but of common reason, but receiveth no forced or coyned, but a true and sound distinction, or limitation, which is, that it evermore faileth and deceiveth in cases, where there is any vigor, or <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the naturall person; for generally in <hi>copora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> the naturall body is but <hi>suffulcimentum corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris corporati,</hi> it is but as a stock to uphold and beare out the corporate body, but otherwise it is in the case of theCrown, as shall be manifestly proved in due place. But to shew that this rule receiveth this distinction, I will put but two cases. The statute of the 21. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ordaineth that a Marquesse may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sixe <hi>Chaplaines</hi> qualified, a Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> of <hi>England</hi> foure, a Privie Counsellour three.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130509:20"/>
The Lord <hi>Treasurer Paulet</hi> was Marqueffe of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> Lord Treasurer of <hi>England</hi> and privie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor all at once. Question was whether hee should qualifie 13. Chaplaines. Now by the Rule <hi>cum duo Iura,</hi> he should; but adjudged, he should not. And the Reason was because the attendance of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines concerned and respected his naturall person, he had but one soule, though he had three Offices. The other case which I will put, is the case of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, a man doth homage to his Lord for a Tenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie held of the mannor of Dale, there descendeth unto him afterwards a Tenancie held of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Sale, which mannor of Sale is likewise in the hands of the same Lord. Now by the Rule <hi>cum duo jura,</hi> he should doe homage againe, two Tenancies and two Seignories, though but one Tenant, and one Lord, <hi>aequum est ac si esset in duobus.</hi> But ruled that he should not doe homageagaine: nay in the Case of the King, hee shall not pay a second respect of Homage, as upon grave and deliberate considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was resolved, 24. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>Vsus Scaccarii;</hi> as is there said accordingly. And the Reason is no other but because when a man is sworne to his Lord, hee cannot be sworne over againe, he hath but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the Obligation of this Oatli, trencheth betweene the naturall person of the Tenant, and the naturall person of the Lord. And certainly the Case of Homage and Tenure, and of Homage Liege, which is one case, are things of a neere Nature, save that the one is much inferiour to the other, but it is good to behold these great matters of State in cases of lower Element, as the Eclipse of the Sun is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:130509:20"/>
used to be in a paile of Water.</p>
            <p>The third maine Argument conteyneth certain supposed inconveniences, which may ensue of a generall Naturalization <hi>ipso jure,</hi> of which kind three have bin specially remembred.</p>
            <p>The first is the losse of profit, to the King upon Letters of Denization, and purchases of <hi>Aliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is the concourse of <hi>Scottishmen</hi> into this Kingdome, to the infeebling of that Realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> in people, and the impoverishing of this Realme of <hi>England</hi> in wealth.</p>
            <p>The third is, that the reason of this case stayeth not within the compasse of the present case; for although it were some reason that <hi>Scottishmen</hi> were naturalized being people of the same <hi>Iland</hi> and <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> yet the reason which we urge, which is, That they are subject to the same King, may be applyed to persons every way more estranged from us then they are, as if in future time in the Kings descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, there should be a match with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Dominions of <hi>Spaine</hi> should bee united with the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> by one reason (say they) all the <hi>VVest-Indies</hi> should be naturalized; which are people not onely, <hi>alterius Soli</hi> but <hi>alterius Caeli.</hi> To these conceits of inconvenience, how easie it is to give answer, and how weake they are in themselves, I thinke no man that doth attentively ponder them can doubt; For how small revenue can arise of such <hi>Denizations,</hi> and how honourable it were for the King to take escheats of his Subjects, as if they were <hi>forreyners</hi> (for seisure of <hi>aliens</hi> Lands are in regard the King hath no hold or command of their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:130509:21"/>
persons, and services) every one may perceive. And for the confluence of <hi>Scottishmen,</hi> I thinke wee all conceive the <hi>Spring-tide</hi> is past at the Kings first comming in. And yet wee see very few families of them, throughout the Cities &amp; Boroughes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And for the naturalizing of the <hi>Indies,</hi> we can readily helpe that, when the case comes; for we can make an act of <hi>Parliament</hi> of separation if we like not their consort. But these being Reasons poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and not legall (and we are not now in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but before a Judgment Seate) I will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them, specially since I have one answer which avoids and confounds all their objections in <hi>Law,</hi> which is that the very self-same <hi>objections</hi> doe hold in Countreyes purchased by Conquest. For in Subjects obtained by Conquest, it were more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to indenizate by the Poll, in Subjects obteyned by Conquest, they may come in too fast. And if King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. had accepted the offer of <hi>Christopher Columbus,</hi> whereby the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the <hi>Indies</hi> by <hi>conquest</hi> or <hi>occupation,</hi> all the <hi>Indies</hi> had bin naturalized by the confession of the adverse part. And therfore since it is confessed, that Subjects obteyned by Conquest are naturalized, &amp; that all these objections are common and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as well to case of Conquest, as case of descent, these objections are in themselves destroyed.</p>
            <p>And therefore to proceed now to overthrow that distinction of descent and Conquest. <hi>Plato</hi> saith well, the strongest of all authorities is, if a man can alledge the authority of his adversaries against him selfe, we doe urge the Confession of the other side,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:130509:21"/>
that they confessed the <hi>Irish</hi> are <hi>naturalized,</hi> that they confesse the Subjects of the <hi>Iles of Gersie</hi> and <hi>Garnsey,</hi> and <hi>Barwick</hi> to be <hi>naturalized,</hi> and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Calice</hi> and <hi>Tourney</hi> when they were Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish were naturalized, as you may find in the 5. <hi>E.</hi> in <hi>Dyer,</hi> upon the question put to the Judges by Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon Lord Keeper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To avoid this, they flye to a difference, which is new coyned, and is (I speake not to the disadvantage of the persons that use it; for they are driven to it <hi>tanquam ad ultimum refugium,</hi> but the difference it selfe) it is I say full of <hi>ignorance and error.</hi> And therefore to take a view of the supports of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, they alledge foure Reasons.</p>
            <p>The first is, that Countreyes of Conquest, are made parcell of <hi>England;</hi> because they are acquired by the Armes and Treasure of <hi>England.</hi> To this I answer, That it were a very strange <hi>Argument,</hi> that if I waxe rich upon the <hi>Mannor of Dale,</hi> and upon the Revenue thereof purchase a close by it, that it should make that parcell of the <hi>Mannor of Dale.</hi> But I will set this new Learning on ground with a question or case put. For J oppose them that hold this opinion with this Question, if the King should conquer any Forreigne Countrey by an Army compounded of <hi>English-men</hi> and <hi>Scottish-men,</hi> as it is like whensoever Warres are, so it will be. I demand whether this Countrey conquered shall qe <hi>naturalized</hi> both in <hi>England and Scotland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was purchased by the joynt Armes of both? And if yea, whether any man will thinke it reasonable, that such Subjects bee <hi>naturalized</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:130509:22"/>
in both Kingdomes, the one Kingdome not being naturalized towards the other? <hi>These are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate consequences of Conceits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second reason they alledge, is, that Countreyes won by Conquest become subject to the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Countries Patrimoniall are not,</hi> and that the Law doth draw the <hi>Allegeance,</hi> and <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance Naturalization.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the <hi>Major proposition</hi> of that <hi>Argument,</hi> touching the dependancy of <hi>aliegeance</hi> upon Law, somewhat hath bin already spoken, and full answer shalbe given when we come to it. But in this place it shall suffice to say, that the <hi>Minor proposition</hi> is false, that is, that the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> are not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced upon any Countrey by Conquest; but that the old Lawes remaine un till the King by his <hi>Proclamation</hi> or <hi>Letters pattents</hi> declare other Lawes, and then if he will, hee may declare Lawes which be utterly repugnant, and differing from the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi> And hereof many antient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents and Records may be shewed; that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why <hi>Ireland</hi> is subject to the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> is not <hi>ipso jure</hi> upon conquest; but grew by <hi>aChar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of K. John, and that extended but to so much as was then in the Kings possession, For there areRe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in the time of King. S. 1 and 2 of divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grants to sundry Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their Heires, that they might use and observe the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Reason is, that there is a politique ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of intermixture of people in case of subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, by Conquest to remove alienations of mind, &amp;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:130509:22"/>
to securo the Stato, which holdeth not in case of descent. <hi>Here I perceive Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath read some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in matter of State, and so have I likewise, though we may both quickly lose ourselves in cause of this Nature.</hi> I find by the best opinions, that there bee two meanes to assure and retaine in obedience Countreyes conquered, both very differing, almost in extreames the one towards the other.</p>
            <p>The one is by <hi>Colonies,</hi> and intermixture of <hi>people,</hi> and <hi>transplantation</hi> of <hi>families,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> spoke off, and it was indeed the <hi>Romane manner</hi> but this is like an old relique, much reverenced and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most never used. But th'other which is the modern manner, and almost wholly in practice &amp; use, is by <hi>Garrisons and Citadelles,</hi> and <hi>Lists</hi> or <hi>Companies</hi> of men of <hi>Warre,</hi> and other like matters of <hi>terrour and bridle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first of these (which is little used) it it true that <hi>naturalization</hi> doth conduce, but to the latter it is utterly opposite, as putting too great pride, and meanes to do hurt, in those that are meant to be kept short and low. And yet in the very first case of the <hi>Romane</hi> proceeding, <hi>Naturalization</hi> did never follow by Conquest, during all the growth, of the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> but was ever conferred by <hi>Charters,</hi> or <hi>Donations,</hi> sometimes to <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>Townes,</hi> sometimes to particular persons, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Nations,</hi> untill the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> and the Law in <hi>Orbe Romano, and that Law or constitution</hi> is not referred to title of <hi>Conquest</hi> and <hi>Armes</hi> onely, but to all other titles; <hi>as by the Donation and Testament of Kings, by submission and</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:130509:23"/>
dedition of States, or the like. So as this difference was as strange to them, as to us. And certainly I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it will sound strangely in the hearing of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Nations, that the law of <hi>England</hi> should <hi>ipso sacto, naturalize subjects of Conquest,</hi> and should not naturalize Subjects, which grow unto the King by descent; that is, that it should conferre the benefit and priviledge of naturalization upon such, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the first but beare hatred and rancor to the state of <hi>England,</hi> and have had their hands in the bloud of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and should deny the like benefit to those that are conjoyned with them by a more amiable meane: And that the law of <hi>England,</hi> should conferre <hi>naturalization</hi> upon slaves and vassals (<hi>for people conquered are no better in the beginning) and should deny it to Free-men:</hi> I say it will be marvelled at abroad, of what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion the lawes of <hi>England</hi> bee made, that bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth such differences. But there is little danger of such scandals; for this is a difference, that the law of <hi>England</hi> never knew.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason of this difference is, that in case of Conquest, the territory united can never be separated againe. But in case of descent, there is a possibility, if his Majesties line should faile, the Kingdomes may severe againe to their respective heires, as in the case of 8. H. 6. where it is said, that if Land descend to a man, from the Ancestor, on the part of his Father, and a rent issuing out of it, from an <hi>Ancestor,</hi> on the part of the mother, if the party dye without issue, the Rent is revived. As to this Reason, I know well the continuance of the Kings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:130509:23"/>
line, is no lesse deare to those, that alleadge the reason, then to us that confute it. So as I doe not blame the passing of the reason; but it is answered with no great difficulty; for first the law doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver respect remote and forrein possibilities, as note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably appeared in the great case betweene Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi> and <hi>Houlford</hi> in the Exchequer, where one in the remainder, to the end to bridle tenant in tayle from suffering a common recovery, granted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the King, and because he would be sure to have it out again, without charge or trouble, when his turne was served; he limitted it to the King, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of tenant in tayle. Question grew whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this grant of remainder were good, yea or no. And it was said to be frivolous and void, because it could never by any possibility execute; for tenant in tayle cannot surrender, and if he dyed, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likewise ceased. To which it was answered, <hi>that there was a possibility, that it might execute, which was thus;</hi> Put case that tenant in tayle should enter into Religion having no issue: then the remainder should execute, and the King should hold the land during the naturall life of tenant in tayle, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his civill death. But the Court <hi>una vate</hi> exploded this reason, and said, <hi>that Monasteries were downe, and entries into Religion gone;</hi> and they must be up againe ere this could be, and that the Law did not respect such remote, and forreine possibilities, &amp; so we may hold this for the like; For I think we all hope, that neither of those days shall ever come, either for <hi>Monasteries</hi> to be restored, or for the K. line to faile, but the true answer is, that the possibility
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:130509:24"/>
subseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, remote, or not remote doth not alter the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of law for the present. For that should be, as if in case of the Rent which you put, you should say, that in regard, that the rent maybe severed, it should be said, to be in <hi>esse</hi> in the meane time, and should be grantable, which is cleerely otherwise. And so in the principall cafe, if that should be (which God of his goodnesse forbid) <hi>cessante causa, cessat effectus, the benefit of naturalization for the time to come is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</hi> But that altereth not the operation of the <hi>Law. Rebus sic stantibus.</hi> And therefore I conclude, that this difference is but a devise full of weaknesse and ignorance: and that there is one, and the same reason of <hi>naturalizing</hi> subjects by descent, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by conquest, and that is the union in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King; <hi>and therefore that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is as cleere, as that of Ireland, and they that grant the one, cannot deny the other.</hi> And so I conclude the second part, touching <hi>confutation.</hi>

               <hi>Favour of Law,</hi> what meane J by that? the Law is equall, and favoureth not: It is true, not persons: but things or matters it doth favour. Is it not a common principle, that the Law favoureth three things, <hi>Life, Liberty, &amp; Dower?</hi> And what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this favour? This, <hi>because our Law is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Law of Nature.</hi> And these three things doe flow from the Law of Nature, <hi>preservation of life Naturall, Liberty, which every Beast or Bird seeketh and affecteth naturally, the society of man and wife, whereof Dower is the reward naturall.</hi> It is well, doth the Law favour <hi>Liberty</hi> so highly, as a man shall infranchise his bondman, when hee thinketh not of it, by granting to him, <hi>Lands or Goods?</hi> And is the reason of it, <hi>quia natura omnes homines erant liberi?</hi> and that <hi>servitude</hi> or <hi>villenage,</hi> doth crosse and abridge the Law of Nature? And doth not the selfe-same reason hold in the present case; For my Lords by the Law of Nature, all men in the world are naturalized one towards another, they were all made of one lumpe of earth, of one breath of God, they had the same common Parents. Nay at the first they were, as the Scripture sheweth, <hi>unius Labii, of one Language,</hi> untill the curse, which curse (thankes be to God) our present case is exempted from. It was <hi>Ciuill and Nationall Lawes,</hi> that brought in these words, and differences of <hi>Civis</hi> and <hi>Exterus,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:130509:25"/>
Alien &amp; Native</hi> And therefore because they tend to abridge the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Law favoureth not them, but takes them strictly, even as our Law hath an excellent rule, that customes of Townes &amp; <hi>Burroughes</hi> shall be taken and construed strictly &amp; precisely, because they doe abridge and derogate from the law of the land. So by the same reason all <hi>Nationall Lawes</hi> whatsoever, are to be taken strictly and hardly in any point wherein they abridge, and derogate from the law of Nature. Whereupon I conclude that your Lordships cannot judge the law for the other side, except the case be <hi>Luce cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> And if it appeare to you but doubtfull, as I thinke no man in his right senses but will yeeld it, to be at least doubtfull, <hi>Then ought your Lordships (under your correction be it spoken) to pronounce for us because of the favour of the Law.</hi> Furthermore as the law of <hi>England</hi> must favour <hi>Naturalization,</hi> as a branch of the law of <hi>Nature:</hi> so it appeares mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, that it doth favour it accordingly. <hi>For is it not much to make a Subject Naturalized? By the law of England, it should suffice, either place or Parents,</hi> if he be born in <hi>England,</hi> it is matter no though his Parents be <hi>Spanyards,</hi> or what you will. On th'other side, if he be borne of <hi>English Parents,</hi> it skilleth not though he be borne in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or in any other place of the World. In such sort doth the <hi>Law of England</hi> open her lappe to receive in people to be <hi>Naturalized,</hi> which indeed sheweth the wisedome and excellent composition of our law. And that it is the law of a Warlike and Magnanimous <hi>Nation,</hi> sit for Empire. For looke, and you shall find that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:130509:25"/>
such kind of estates have been ever liberall in point of <hi>Naturalization:</hi> whereas <hi>Marchant-like and envious estates have bin otherwise.</hi> For the reasons of law joyned with authorities, I doe first observe to your <hi>Lordships,</hi> that our assertion or affirmation is simple and plaine: that it sufficeth to naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there be one King, and that the party be, <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad sidem Regis,</hi> agreeable to the definition of <hi>Littleton:</hi> which is. <hi>Alien</hi> is he which is born out of the allegeance of our <hi>Lord the King.</hi> They of th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side speak of respects, and <hi>quoad</hi> and <hi>quatenus,</hi> and such subtilties and distinctions. To maintaine therefore our assertion, J will use three kindes of proofes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is, that allegeance cannot be applyed to the Law or Kingdome, but to the person of the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Allegeance of the Subject is more large and spatious, and hath a greater latitude, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then the Law or the Kingdome. And therefore it cannot be a dependency of that, without the which it may of it selfe subsist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second proofe which I will use, is, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body of the King hath an operation and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into his body politique, aswell as his body politique hath upon his body Naturall, And therefore that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his body politique of King of</hi> England, <hi>and his body politique of King of</hi> Scotland <hi>be soverall and distinct: Yet neverthelesse, his Naturall person, which is one, hath an operation upon both, and createth aprivity betweene them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:130509:26"/>
            <p>And the third proofe is the binding text of five severall statutes.</p>
            <p>For the first of these I shall make it manifest, that the allegeance is of a greater extent, and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then Lawes or Kingdome, and cannot confist by the lawes meerely, because it began before laws, it continueth after Lawes, and it is in vigour where Lawes are suspended, and have not their force. That it is more antient then law, appeareth by that which was spoken in the beginning by way of inducement where I did endeavour to demonstrate, that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall age of Kingdomes was governed by <hi>naturall equity,</hi> that Kings were more antient then Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, that the first submissions were simple, and upon confidence to the person of Kings, and that the Allegeance of Subjects to hereditary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, can no more be said to consist by lawes, then the obedience of Children to Parents.</p>
            <p>That Allegeance continueth after lawes, I will onely put the case, which was remembred by two great Judges in a great Assembly, the one of them now with God, which was: <hi>that if a King of. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land should be expalsed his Kingdome, and some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular subjects should follow him in flight, or exile in forreigne parts, and any of them there should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire his death, that upon his rocoveryof his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; such a subject might by the Law of England be proceeded with; for Treason committed and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated at what time he had no Kingdome, and in place wher ethe Law did not bind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Allegeance is in vigour and force, where
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:130509:26"/>
the power of Law hath a cessation appeareth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in time of Warres, for <hi>silent leges inter arma.</hi> And yet the Soveraignty, and Imperiall power of the King, is so farre, from being then extinguished, or suspended; as contrariwsse it is raised, and made more absolute, for then he may proceed by his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authority, and Martiall Law without obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formalities of the Lawes of his Kingdome. And therefore whosoever speaketh of Lawes, and the Kings power by Lawes, and the Subjects obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or allegeance to Lawes, speake but of one halfe of the Crowne. For <hi>Bracton</hi> out of <hi>Justinian</hi> doth truly define, the Crowne to consist of Lawes and Armes, power Civill and Martiall, with the latter whereof the Law doth not intermeddle, so as where it is much spoken <hi>that the Subjects of England are under one Law, and the Subjects of Scotland are under another Law, it is true at</hi> Edenborough <hi>or</hi> Sterling, <hi>or againe in London, or Yorke; But if Englishmen and Scottishmen meet in an Army Royall before Calice.</hi> I hope then they are under one Law. So likewise not onely in time of warre, but in time of peregrination: <hi>If a King of</hi> England <hi>travaile, or passe through for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine territories; yet the allegeance of his Subjects followeth him, as appeareth in that not able case which is reported in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>For my second maine proofe; that is drawn from the true &amp; legall distinction of the Kings severall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; for they that maintaine the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe in effect destroy the whole force of the Kings naturall capacity, as if it were drowned and swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by his politique. And therefore I will first prove to your Lordships, that his two capacities are in no sort confounded; and secondly, that as his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity politique worketh so upon his naturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as it makes it differ from all other the naturall persons of his Subjects: so <hi>è converso,</hi> his naturall body worketh so upon his politique, as the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Crowne utterly differeth from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corporations within the Realme.</p>
            <p>For the first I will vouch you the very words which I find in that notable case of the Dutchie, where the question was, whether the grants of King <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> for Dutchy lands should be avoyded in points of nonage. The case, as your Lordships know well, is reported by Mr. <hi>Plowden,</hi> as the generall resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and the Kings lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Counsell, <hi>Ruswell</hi> the Solicitour, onely except, there I find the said words, <hi>Comment. fol. 215. There is in the King not a body naturall alone, nor a body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique alone, but a body naturall and politique together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

case of the Lord <hi>Barkeley</hi> set downe by the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, <hi>Comment fol. 234. Though there be in the King two bodies, and that those two bodies are conjoyned; yet are they by no meanes confounded the one by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then to see the mutuall and reciprocall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse, as I may terme it, or influence, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of qualities that these bodies have one upon the other. The body politique of the Crowne indueth the naturall person of the King with these perfections. That the King in Law shall never be said to be within age; that his blood shall never be corrupted; and that, if he were attainted before, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry assumption of the Crown purgeth it. That the K. shall not take but by matter of Record, although he take in his naturall capacity, as upon a guift in taile. That his body in Law shall be said to be as it were immortall, for there is no death of the King in Law, but a demise as it is tearmed; with many other the like Priviledges, and differences from other naturall persons too long to rehearse, the rather because the question laboureth not in that part. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, let us see what oporations the Kings na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall person hath upon his Crowne and body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique: Of which the chiefest and greatest is, that it causeth the Crowne to goe by descent, which is a thing strange, and contrary to the course of all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, which evermore take in succession, and not by descent, for no man can shew mee in all the Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> of what nature soever, vvhether they consist of one person, or of many: or whether they be Temporall or Ecclesiasticall, any one takes to him and his heires, but all to him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:130509:28"/>
and his successours; And therefore here you may see what a weake course that is, <hi>to put cases of Bishops and Parsons, and the like, and to apply them to the Crowne.</hi> For the King takes to him and his heires in the manner of a naturall body, and the word succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours is but superfluous, and where that is used that is ever duly placed after the words heires. <hi>The King, his heires and Successours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe no man can deny but <hi>vxor &amp; filius sunt nomina naturae.</hi> A Corporation can have no wife; nor a Corporation can have no sonne; how is it then, that it is treason to compasse the death of the Queene, or of the Prince. There is no part of the body politique of the Crovvne in either of them, but it is entirely in the King. So likewise we find in the case of the Lord <hi>Barkeley,</hi> the question was whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Statute of 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for that part which concerned Queene <hi>Katherine Pars</hi> joynture were a publique act or no, of which the Judges ought to take notice, not being pleaded: And judged a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Act. So the like question came before your Lordship, my Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> in Serjeant. <hi>Heales</hi> case: whether the Statute of 11. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the intayling of the Dukedome of <hi>Cornewall</hi> to the Prince vvere a publique Act or no; and ruled likewise a publique Act. Why? no man can affirme, but these be operations of Lavv, proceeding from the dignity of the naturall person of the King: for you shall never find that another Corporation vvhatsoever of a Bishop or Master of a Colledge, or Major of <hi>London,</hi> vvorketh any thing in Lavv upon the vvife, or sonne of the Bishop or the Major. And to conclude this point and vvithall to come neere to

the case in question, I will shew you where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall person of the King hath not onely an operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the case of his wife and children, but likewise in the case of his Subjects, which is the very questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hand: As for example, I put this case, can a <hi>Scottishman</hi> who is a Subject to the naturall person of the King, and not to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> can a <hi>Scottishman,</hi> I say, be an enemy by the Lavv to the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> or must he not of necessity, if he should invade <hi>England,</hi> be a Rebell, and no enemy not onely as to the King, but as to the Subject? Or can any Letters of Marte or reprisall be granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a <hi>Scottishman,</hi> that should spoyle an <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> goods at Sea, and certainly this case doth presse exceeding neere the principall case, for it prooveth plainly, that the naturall person of the King, hath such a communication of qualities with his body politique; as it makes the Subjects of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes stand in another degree of privity one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other; then they did before. And so much for the second proofe.</p>
            <p>For the five Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> which I spoke of which are concluding to this question?</p>
            <p>The first of them is, <hi>that concerning the banishment of Hugh Spencer in the time of King Ed.</hi> 2. In which act there is contained, the charge, and accusation whereupon his exile proceeded. One Article of which charge is set downe in these words. <hi>Homage and Oath of the Subject is more by reason of the crowne, then by reason of the person of the King. So that if the King doth not guide himselfe by reason in right of the Crowne, his lieges are bound by their oath to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130509:29"/>
Crowne to remoove the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which act doth plain'y appeare the perilous consequence of this distinction concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King, and the Crowne. And yet J doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Justice, and ingeruously a great difference betweene that assertion and this, which is now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: for it is one thing to make things distinct, another thing to make them separable, <hi>Aliud est di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctio, aliud separatio,</hi> and therefore J assure my selfe, that those, that now use and urge that diftincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dee as firmely hold, that the subjection to the Kings person, and to the Crowne, are inseparable, though distinct, as I doe. And it is true that the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the opinion, &amp; assertion of <hi>Spencer</hi> is like the poyson of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> more in the taile then in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For it is the inference that they make which is, that the King may be deposed or removed, that is, <hi>the treason and dislayalty of that opinion:</hi> But by you leave the body is rever a whit the more wholesome meare, for having such a tayle belonging to it: therefore we see that is <hi>Locus lubricus,</hi> an opinion from which a man may ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly slide into an absurdity. But upon this act of Parliament, I will onely note one circumstance more, and so leave it, which may adde authority unto it in the opinion of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, and that is, that these <hi>Spencers,</hi> were not ancient nobles or great Patriots that were charged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by upstarts and favourites: for then that might be said that it was but the action of some flatterers, who use to extoll the power of Monarches to be infinite, but it was contrary; a prosecution of those persons being favourites by the Nobility, so as the Nobility themselves which seldome doe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:130509:29"/>
subscribe to the opinion of an infinite power of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches. Yet even they could not endure, but their blood did rise to heare that opinion: that subjection is owing to the Crowne, rather then to the person of the King.</p>
            <p>The second Act of Parliament which determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this case, is the act of recognition in the first yeare of his Majestie, wherein you shall find, that in two severall places, the one in the Preamble, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the body of the Act, the Parliament doth recognize, <hi>that these two Realmes of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are under one Imperiall Crowne.</hi> The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not say under one Monarchie or King which mought referre to the person, but under ono Imperiall Crowne, which cannot be applyed but to the Soveraigne power of Regiment, comprehending both Kingdomes. And the third act of Parliament is the Act made in the fourth yeare of his Majesties Raigne for the abolition of hostile Lawes, wherein your Lordships shall find likewise in two places, that the Parliament doth acknowledge, that there is an union of these two Kingdomes already begun in his Majesties person. So as by the declaration of that act, they have not onely one King, but there is an union in inception in the Kingdomes, themselves.</p>
            <p>These two are Judgements in Parliament by way of declaration of Law, against which no man can speake. And certainly these are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and true Iudgements to be relyed upon; not onely for the authority of them, but for the verity of them, for to any that shall well, and deeply weigh the effects of Law upon this conjunction, it cannot
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:130509:30"/>
but appeare, that although <hi>partes integrales</hi> of the Kingdome (as the Philosophers speake) such as the Lawes, the Officers, the Parliament are not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; yet neverthelesse there is but one, and the selfe-same fountaine of soveraigne power depending upon the ancient submission, whereof I spake in the beginning, and in that sense, the Crownes and the Kingdomes are truly said to be united.</p>
            <p>And the force of this truth is such, that a grave and learned Gent. that defended the contrary opinion, did confesse thus farre: That in ancient times when Monarchies (as he said) were but heapes of people, without any exact forme of policy, that the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization and communication of Priviledges did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the person of the Monarch. But otherwise since States were reduced to a more exact forme: So as thus farre we did consent; but still I differ from him in this, <hi>that those more exact formes wrought by time, and custome, and Lawes, are neverthelesse still upon the first foundation, and doe serve onely to perfect and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the force and bond of the first submission, and in no sort to disanullor destroy it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore with these two acts doe J likewise couple the Act of 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged of the other side. For by collating of that Act with this former too, the truth of that we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme will the more evidently appeare, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rule of reason: <hi>Opposita juxta se posita magis elucescunt.</hi> That act of 14. is an act of separation. These two Acts formerly recited are Acts tending to union. This Act is an act that maketh a new Law, it is by the words of <hi>grant</hi> and <hi>establish,</hi> these
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130509:30"/>
two Acts declare the common law, as it is, being by words of <hi>Recognition</hi> and <hi>Confession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore upon the difference of these lawes you may fubstantially ground this position. That the <hi>Common-law of England</hi> upon the adjunction of any Kingdome unto the King of <hi>England,</hi> doth make some degree of union in the Crownes, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes themselves: except by a speciall Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> they be dissevered.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the 5. <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the <hi>Act</hi> made in the 42. of E. 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 10. which is expresse decision of the point in question. The words are, <hi>Item,</hi> (upon the <hi>Petition</hi> put into <hi>Parliament</hi> by the <hi>Commons,) That Infants borne beyond the Seas in the Seignories of Callice, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where within the lands and Seignories that pertain to our Soveraign Lord the King beyond the Seas, bee as able and inheritable of their heritage in England, as other Infants borne within the Realme of England, it is accorded that the Common-law and the Statute formerly made be holden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Act, J inferre thus much, first that such as the <hi>Petition</hi> mentioneth, were naturalized, the practice shewes; Then, if so, it must be either by Common-law, or Statute; for so the words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, not by Statute; for there is no other statute, but 25. of E. 3. and that extends to the case of birth out of the Kings obedience, where the Parents are <hi>English, Ergo</hi> it was by the Common-law, for that onely remaines. And so by the Declarations of this statute at the Common-law. <hi>All Infants borne within the Lands and Seignories</hi> (for I give you the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:130509:31"/>
very words againe) <hi>that pertaine to our Soveraigne Lord the King,</hi> it is not said, as are the Dominions of England, <hi>are as able and inheritable of their heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in England, as other Infants borne within the Realme of England:</hi> what can be more plaine? And so I leave Statutes, and goe to Presidents; for though the one doe bind more, yet the other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth satisfie more. For presidents in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing &amp; using of that kind of proofe, of all others it behoveth them to be faithfully vouched; for the suppressing or keeping back of a circumstance may change the case, and therefore J am determined to urge only such presidents, as are without all colour or scruple of exception, or objection, even of those objections which I have, to my thinking fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered &amp; confuted. This is now, by the Providence of God the fourth time that the line, and Kings of England have had Dominions &amp; Seignories united unto them, as Patrimonies, and by descent of bloud; foure unions I say there have bin inclusive with this last. The first was of <hi>Normandy</hi> in the person of <hi>William</hi> commonly called the <hi>Conqueror.</hi> The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. was of <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. in his person I say, though by severall titles. The 3. was of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> in the person of K. Edw. the third. And the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his Majesty. Of these I will set aside such, as by any cavillation can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted unto. First, J will set aside <hi>Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy,</hi> because it will be said, that the difference of countryes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing by conquest, from countryes annexed by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in matter of Communication of priviledges
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:130509:31"/>
holdeth both wayes, as well of the part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Kingdome, as the conquered. And therfore that although <hi>Normandy</hi> was not conquest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet <hi>England</hi> was a conquest of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and so a communication of priviledges between them. Againe, set aside France, for that it will be said, that although the King had a title in bloud, and by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yet that title was executed and recovered by Armes: So as it is a mixt title of conquest &amp; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and therefore the President not so cleare.</p>
            <p>There remaines then <hi>Gascoyne &amp; Anjou,</hi> and that president, likewise I will reduce and abridge to a time to avoid all question. For it will bee said of them also, that after they were lost and recovered in <hi>ore gladii,</hi> that the antient title of bloud was extinct &amp; that the King was in upon his new title by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, &amp; Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> had found a book case, in 13. <hi>of H. 6.</hi> abridged by Mr. <hi>Fitz-Herbert,</hi> in title of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, <hi>placito</hi> 56. where a protection was cast, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uia profecturus in Gasconiam</hi> with the Earlo of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon,</hi> and challenged because it was not a voyage royall, &amp; the Justices thereupon required the sight of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, which was brought before them, &amp; purported power to pardon Felouies, &amp; treason, power to coyn money, &amp; power to conquer them that resist, wherby M. <hi>Walter</hi> finding the word <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> collected that the Kings title at that time was reputed to bee by Conquest, wherein I may not omit to give <hi>Obiter</hi> that Answer, which Law and Truth provideth, namely that when any King obreyneth by warre a Countrey, whereunto he hath right by Birth, that hee is ever in upon his Antient Right, not upon his purchase by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:130509:32"/>
and the Reason is, that there is as well a Judgement and recovery by Warre and Armes, as by law and course of Justice; for war is a tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seat, wherein God giveth the judgment, &amp; the tryall is by battaile, or <hi>Duell,</hi> as in the case of tryall of private right, and then it followes, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commeth in by eviction, comes in his remitter: so as there will bee no difference in Countreyes whereof the right commeth by descent, whether the possession be obtained peaceably or by war, but yet neverthelesse, because I will utterly take away all manner of evasion, &amp; subterfuge, I will yet set apart that part of time in and during, the which, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Gascoyne &amp; Guyenne</hi> might bee thought to be subdued by a reconquest. And therefore I will not meddle with the <hi>Prior of Shellies</hi> case, though it be an excellent case; because it was in that time, 27. <hi>of E.</hi> 3. neither will I meddle with any cases, records, or presidents, in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 5. or King <hi>H.</hi> 6. for the same reason, but will hold my selfe to a portion of time, from the first uniting of these Provinces in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 2. untill the time of K. <hi>Iohn.</hi> At what time those Provinces were lost, and from that time againe unto the 17. yeere of the Reigne of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. at what time the Statute of <hi>proerogativa Rogis</hi> was made, which altered the law in the point in hand.</p>
            <p>That both in these times, the Subjects of <hi>Gascoyn</hi> and <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> were naturalized for inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in <hi>England</hi> by the lawes of <hi>England.</hi> I shall manifestly prove, and the proofe proceeds, as to the former time (which is our case) in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, a <hi>minore ad majus,</hi> and as we say, <hi>a multo fortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:130509:32"/>
For if this priviledge of naturalization remained unto them when the Countreyes were lost, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came subjects in possession to another King: much more did they enjoy it, as long as they continued under the Kings subjection.</p>
            <p>Therefore to open the State of this point. After these Provinces were through the perturbations of the State in the infortunate time ofK. <hi>Iohn</hi> lost, and severed, the principall persons which did adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>French</hi> were attainted of Treason, and their efcheats here in <hi>England</hi> taken and seized. But the people that could not resist the tempest, when their Heads and Leaders were revolted, continued inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to their possessions in <hi>England,</hi> and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the people of <hi>England</hi> inherited and succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their possessions in <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> and were both accounted, <hi>ad fidem utriusque Regis,</hi> untill the Statute of <hi>Proerogativa Regis,</hi> wherein the wisdome and justice of the <hi>Law of England</hi> is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be commended. For of this law, there are two grounds of reason, The one of equity, The other of policy. That of Equity was because the common people were in no fault, but as the Scripture saith in a like case, <hi>quid fecerunt oves iftoe?</hi> It was the cowardise and disloyalty of their Governours that deserved punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, butwhat had these sheep done, and therefore to have punish't them, and deprived them of their lands &amp; fortunes had bin unjust. That of policy was, because if the law had forthwith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the losse of the Countreyes by an accident of time pronounced the people for <hi>Aliens,</hi> it had been a kind of Cession of their right, and a diselaymer in them, and so a greater difficulty to recover them.

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:130509:34"/>
And therefore we see the Statute, which altered the law in this point, was made in the time of a weake king, that, as it seemed, despaired ever to recover his right, and therefore thought better to have a little present profit by escheats, then the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his claime, and the countenance of his right by the admitting of them to enjoy their inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they did before.</p>
            <p>The State therefore of this point, being thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, it resteth to prove our assertion that they were naturalized; for the clearing whereof, I shall need but to reade the authorities, they be so direct and pregnant. The first is the very text of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Praerogativa Regis. Rex habebit escaetas de terris Normannorum cujuscunque feodi fuerint, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo servitio, quod pertinet ad capitales dominos feodi illius, &amp; hoc similiter intelligendum est, si aliqua hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditus descendat alicui nato in partibus transma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinis, &amp; cujus antecefsores fuerunt ad fidem Regis Franciae, ut tempore Regis Iohannis, &amp; non ad fidem Regis Angliae, sicut contigit de Baronia Monume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Statute it appeares plainly that before the time of <hi>King Iohn,</hi> there was no colour of any Escheare, because they were the kings Subjects in possession, as <hi>Scotland</hi> now is, but onely it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Law, from that time forward.</p>
            <p>This Statute if it had in it any obscurity, it is taken away by two lights, the one placed before it, and th'other placed after it, both authors of great credit the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for antient, th'other for late times. The former is <hi>

                  </gap>, lib. 5. fol. 427.</hi> and his words are these, <hi>Est etiam &amp;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:130509:34"/>
alia exceptie quae tenenti competitex persona peten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis propter defectum Nationis, quae dilatoria est, &amp; non<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perimit actionem, ut si qnis alienigena qui fuerit ad fidem Regis Franciae, &amp; actionem instituat versus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquem qui fuerit ad fidem Regis Angliae, tali non<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>respondeatur saltem donec terrae fuerint communes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these words it appeareth, that after the losse of the Provinces beyond the Seas, the Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Subjects of those Provinces was in no sort extinguished, but onely was in suspence during time of warre and no longer; for he saith plainly, that the exception which we call plea to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Alien,</hi> was not peremptory but onely dilato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is to say, during the time of war, and untill there were peace concluded, which hee tearmes by these words, <hi>donec terrae fuerint communes,</hi> which though the phrase seeme somewhat obscure is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Bracton</hi> himselfe in his fourth booke, <hi>fol. 297.</hi> to be of peace made and concluded where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> and those Provinces might enjoy the profits and fruits of their lands in either place <hi>communiter,</hi> that is respectively, or as well the one as th'other: so as it is cleere, they were no <hi>Aliens</hi> in right, but onely interrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred of Suites in the Kings Courts in time of Warre.</p>
            <p>The authority after the Statute, is, that of Master <hi>Stamfords,</hi> the best Expositor of a statute that hath bin in our law, a man of reverend judgment, &amp; excellent order in his writings, his words are in his expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon the branch of that statute which we read before.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:130509:35"/>
               <hi>By this branch it should appeare, that at this time men of</hi> Normandy, Gascoyne, Guienne, Anjou, <hi>and</hi> Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>were inheritable within this Realme, aswell as English-men, because that they were sometimes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Kings of England and under their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, untill</hi> K. Johns <hi>time, as is aforesaid, &amp; yet after his time, those men (saving such whose lands were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away for treason) were still inheritable within this Realme, till the making of this Statute, and in the time of peace betweene the two Kings of England, and France, they were answerable within this Realme, if they had brought any action for their Lands and Tenements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as by these three authorities, every one so plainly pursuing th'other, we conclude that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Gascoyne, Guienne, Anjou,</hi> and the rest from their first union by descent, untill the making of the Statute, <hi>of praerogativa Regis,</hi> were inheritable in <hi>England,</hi> and to be answered in the Kings Courts in all actions, except it were in time of warre. Nay more (which is <hi>de abundante</hi>) that when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were lost, and disannexed, and that the King was but King <hi>de jure</hi> over them, and not <hi>de facto:</hi> Yet neverthelesse, the priviledge of naturalization continued.</p>
            <p>There resteth yet one objection, rather plausible to a popular understanding, then any waies forcible in law, or learning, which is a difference taken between the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and these Dutchies, for that the one is a Kingdome, and th'other was not so, and therefore that those Provinces being of an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:130509:35"/>
inferiour nature, did acknowledge our Lawes, and Seales, and Parliament which the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> doth not.</p>
            <p>This difference was well given over by Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> for it is plaine, that a Kingdome and absolute Dukedome, or any other Soveraigne estate doe differ <hi>honore,</hi> and not <hi>potestate;</hi> For divers Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and Countries that are now, were sometimes Kingdomes; and divers kingdomes that are now, were sometimes Dutchies, or of other inferiour Style, wherein we neede not travaile abroad since we have in our owne state so notorious an instance of the Countrey of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereof King <hi>H.</hi> 8. of late time was the first that writ himselfe King the former Style being L. of <hi>Ireland</hi> and no more, and yet Kings had the same authority before, that they have had since and the same Nation the same marks of a Soveraigne State, as their <hi>Parliaments,</hi> their <hi>Armes,</hi> their <hi>Coynes,</hi> as they now have, so as this is too superficiall an allegation labour upon.</p>
            <p>And if any doe conceive, that <hi>Gascoyne</hi> and <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> were governed by the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi> First, that cannot be in reason, for it is a true ground, that wheresoever any Princes Title unto any Countrey is by Law, he can never change the Lawes, for that they create his Title: and therefore no doubt those Dutchies retained their owne Lawes, which if they did, then they could not be subject to the Lawes of <hi>England</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:130509:36"/>
            <p>And next againe the fact or practize was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, as appeareth by all consent of <hi>Story</hi> and <hi>Record:</hi> For those Dutchies continued governed by the Civill Law, their tryalls by witresses and not by Jurie, their lands Testamentary, and the like.</p>
            <p>Now for the colours, that some have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to give, that they should have beene subordinate to the government of <hi>England,</hi> they were partly weake, and partly such as make strongly against them, for as to that, that writs of <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Seale of <hi>England</hi> have gone to <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> it is no manner of proofe, for that the Kings writs which are mendatory and not writs of ordinary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice may goe to his Subjects into any forraine parts whatsoever, and under what Seale it pleaseth him to use; and as to that, that some Acts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> have beene cited, wherein the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have taken upon them to order matters of <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> if those Statutes be well looked into, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more plainly convince the contrary, for they intermeddle with nothing but that that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth either the <hi>English</hi> Subjects personally, or the territories of England locally, and never the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> for looke upon the Statute of 27. of <hi>Ed. 3. ca. 5.</hi> there it is said, <hi>That there shall be no fore-stasting of Wines,</hi> but by whom? onely by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Merchants, not a word of the Subjects of <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne,</hi> and yet no doubt they mighr be offenders in the same kind.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:130509:36"/>
            <p>So in the sixt Chapter it is said, <hi>That all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Gascoyoes may safely bring Wines into what part it shall please them, here now are the persons of Gascoynes, but then the place whether</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> and in the 7. Chap. that erects the Ports of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and <hi>Bayonne,</hi> for the staple Townes of wine, the Statute Ordaines that if any, but who? <hi>English Marchant or his Servants shall buy or bargaine other where, his body shall be arrested by the Steward of Gascoyne, or the Constable of Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux:</hi> true, for the Officers of <hi>England</hi> could not catch him in <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> but what shall become of him, shall he be proceeded with within <hi>Gascoyne?</hi> No, but he shall be sent over into <hi>England</hi> into the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this doth notably disclose the reason of that custome, which some have sought to wrest the other way, that custome, I say, whereof a forme doth yet remaine, that in every Parliament the King doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point certaine Committees in the Upper-House to receive the Petitions of <hi>Normandy, Guyenne</hi> and the rest, which as by the former Statute doth appeare could not be for the ordering of the governments there, but for the liberties, and good usage of the Subjects of those parts, when they came hither, or <hi>via versa,</hi> for the restraining of the abuses and misdemeanors of our Subjects when they went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I am now at an end. For us to speake of the mischiefes, I hold it not fit for this place,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:130509:37"/>
left we should seeme to bend the Lawes to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and not to take them in their true and naturall sense. <hi>It is enough that every man knowes, that it is true of these two Kingdomes, which a good Father said of the Churches of Christ: Si inseparabiles insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles.</hi> Some things I may have forgot, and some things perhaps I may forget willingly; for I will not presse any opinion or declaration of late time which may prejudice the liberty of this debate, but <hi>ex dictis, &amp; ex non dictis,</hi> upon the whole matter I prove Judgement for the Plaintiffe.</p>
