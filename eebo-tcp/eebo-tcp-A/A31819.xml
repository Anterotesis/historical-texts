            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>For the declining other Counſells and the Uniting his confidence to his Parliament, his majeſty deſires both his Houſes of parliament ſeriouſly and ſadly to conſider, that it is not the name of a great or little Councel that makes the Reſults of that Counſell juſt or unjuſt: neither can the imputation upon his majeſty of not being adviſed by his Parliament (eſpecially ſines all their actions and all their Orders are expoſed to the publike view) long miſlead his good Subjects, except in truth they ſée ſome particular ſound advice neceſſary to the peace and hapineſſe of the Common-wealth diſ-oſtéemed by his Majeſty, and ſuch an influence he is moſt aſſured neither can nor ſhall be given, and that they will thinke it merit in his Majeſty from the Common-wealth to rejoin ſuch a Counſell as would perſwade him to make himſelfe none of tho three Eſtates by giving up his negative voyce to allow them a power ſuperiour to that which the Law hath given him, whenſoever it pleaſeth the major part preſent of both Houſes to ſay that he doth not diſcharge his truſt as he ought, and to ſubject his and his Subjects unqueſtionable Right and Propriety to their Uotes, without and againſt Law, upon the méer pretence of neceſſity. And his Majeſty muſt appeale to all the World, who it is that endeavours to divide the joynt duty of his Subjects, his Majeſty who requires nothing but what their owne duty, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the infallible Rule of the Law, leads them to doe, or they who by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Uotes (oppoſite and contradictory to Law, Cuſtome, preſident and reaſon) ſo confound the affections and underſtandings of his good Subjects, that they know not how to behave themſelves with honeſty and ſafety, whileſt their Conſcience will not ſuffer them to ſubmit to the one, nor their ſecurity to apply themſelves to the other. It is not the bare ſaying that his majeſties actions are againſt the Law (with which he is reproached in this Petition, as if hée depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his often Proteſtations to that purpoſe) muſt conclude him, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no one ſuch particular in that petition alleadged, of which his majeſty is in the leaſt degrée guilty: whether the ſame Reverence and eſtéeme be paid by you to the Law (except your owne Uotes be judge) néeds no other Evidence, then thoſe many, very many Orders publiſhed in print, both concerning the Church and State, thoſe long impriſonment of ſeverall perſons without hearing them upon generall information, and the great and unlimited Fees to your Office <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

            <p>His Majeſties confidence is no leſſe then he hath expreſſed (and hath great cauſe to expreſſe) in the affections of this County, an inſtance of which affections all men know his guard (which is not extraordinary) to be, and wonders that ſuch a legall Guard at his own charge for his perſon (within 20. miles of a Rebellion, and of an Army in pay againſt him ſhould be objected by thoſe, who for ſo many months, and in a place of known and confeſſed ſecurity, have without and againſt Law kept a Guard for themſelves at the charge of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and upon that ſtock of money which was given for the Relief of the miſerable and bleeding condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the payment of the great debt due to our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <p>For the reſort of Papiſts to the Court, his Majeſties great care for the prevention therof is notoriouſly known, that when he was informed 2. or 3. of his intended Guard were of that Religion he gave eſpeciall direction, with expreſſions of His diſpleaſure, that they ſhould be immediatly diſcharged, and provided that no perſon ſhould attend on him under that Relation, but ſuch as took the <hi>Oaths of Allegeance,</hi> and <hi>Supremacie;</hi> that he commanded the Sheriffe to proceed with all ſeverity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law againſt all papiſts that ſhould come within five miles of the Court, and if notwithſtanding this, there be any papiſts neer the Court, (which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> aſſures you he knows not, nor hath heard but by this Petition) He doth hereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to depart, and declares to all Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice, that they ſhall proceed ſtrictly againſt them according to the Law, and as they will anſwer the contrary at their perils.</p>
