            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat may be the Fate of
this Book, I can't Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
nor will I be soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
concerning it:
But I expect, and also <hi>claim</hi> at
thine hands so much Candour, as
that, how meanly soever thou
mayest think of it, thou wilt not
judge uncharitably of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Design in writing it. I
(that may best know it) am able
to assure thee, that it was not to
gratifie those Persons (he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he may not rather offend
them) whom he therein giveth
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:50061:3"/>
a true account of; but to serve
a more noble Interest: Nor is it
his desire, that their Adversaries
would entertain a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opinion of them, upon their
reading the following Lines, but
onely in order to their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to their <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an Age wherein plain
and open-hearted Dealing will
be by no means endured, and
must look for no better thanks
from the generality, than Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and down-right Rayling.
But I am very sure that no man
can be easily provoked by any
thing in this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> but he
that accounts Moderation a great
Crime; and is conscious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:50061:3"/>
that he is, in the way it hath
pleased him to espouse, a hot spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
and violent <hi>Zealot.</hi> For
neither <hi>Theophilus</hi> nor <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi>
have taken a course to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
any one of the contesting
Parties, but only (and much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
too) the high and fierce men
of each Party. And as for such,
they could not perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be over-careful not to
displease them; as too well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it would signifie nothing
so to be; they being a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of people whose waspish and
testy (not to add proud) Spirits,
can by no means brook a Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
scarcely in the smallest, and
most trivial matters. Whereas
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> as he passeth along,
<pb n="VI" facs="tcp:50061:4"/>
doth engage himself in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of certain Opinions, I
desire thee to take notice, that he
is, notwithstanding, so far from a
disputing or contradicting Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
that I know no man more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
than himself thereto: And
he thinks time infinitely better
spent in the serious practice of
true Piety, than in disputing or
studying Controversies: and that
there is no such life, when all is
done, as that which is chiefly
employed in mortifying Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and making our selves
more and more like to God, and
fit for the enjoyment of him.
And, indeed, if all our Professors
of Christianity did sincerely
love God; and made it their great
<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:50061:4"/>
business to keep Consciences void
of offence towards him and men;
it would be scarcely worth the
while to concern our selves much
about curing them of any of
their mistakes: For so long as they
are careful to exercise themselves
in so doing, to be sure they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be such as would so
far injure them, as to render them
uncapable of Eternal Blessedness.
But seeing there are several <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
very highly cryed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, which do apparently
make many of the Embracers of
them much worse, and have an
extreamly bad influence upon
their Lives, and therefore much
more upon their Souls, it must
needs be a work of great Charity
<pb n="VIII" facs="tcp:50061:5"/>
to endeavour to undeceive those
that hold them. And they are
such Doctrines alone, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
is assured are of very bad
consequence, that he hath <hi>much</hi>
troubled himself about, in this
<hi>Discourse.</hi> As for the last <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
that he spends any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time in endeavouring to
shew the falsity of, it was at first
his intention to take no notice of
it: But (to deal freely with thee)
he could not, upon second
thoughts, gain leave of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
to let it pass: for that told
him that he would shew but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
love to his infinitely <hi>Good
God,</hi> or concernment for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
should he not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of so fit and proper an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="IX" facs="tcp:50061:5"/>
as was then offered him to
vindicate him from the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Representation that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
giveth of him. And he
solemnly professeth that he
would have said nothing of it,
were he not constrained to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
by his Love to God,
and the Souls of Men: And by
his earnest desire to give his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against the abuse that is
thereby put upon the best of Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
&amp; also to contribute his little
Mite towards the utter silencing
of that Plea for Carelesness and
Irreligion, that very many (if
not most) men from thence make.
<hi>Whoever they be that shall take
offence at that Person for freely
speaking his own mind, because it
<pb n="X" facs="tcp:50061:6"/>
hath the ill hap not to jump with
theirs, I would fain know of them
why he may not be as much out of
humour (though he is resolved he
will not) with</hi> them <hi>again: For
surely</hi> he <hi>doth not more differ from</hi>
them, <hi>than</hi> they <hi>do from</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Reader,</hi> it is high time
to be reconciled to <hi>Moderation</hi>
and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> to lay aside our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
and (therefore) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
heats against each other:
And to labour to preserve the
Unity of the Spirit (if it be not
already quite lost) in the bond
of Peace, and throw water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those Flames that threaten our
destruction, (and but for God's
Infinite Mercy would have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it before now) instead of
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:50061:6"/>
adding more fewel to them. And
that is the <hi>great Design</hi> (as thou
wilt easily perceive) of the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, I most humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
thee to consider, that as
God was not in the <hi>Whirlwind,</hi>
but in the <hi>still Voice;</hi> So <hi>Divine
Truth</hi> is far more unlikely to be
found among men of violent and
boisterous Passions, than among
those that are <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>sedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considerative.</hi> Passion doth
cloud and darken the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
it casts a thick mist before
the eye of the Soul, and makes it
altogether unapt to discern a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt <hi>Truth,</hi> and the
<hi>error</hi> that is nearest to it; and to
distinguish it from one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
<pb n="XII" facs="tcp:50061:7"/>
which it lyeth between.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have another Request to
make to thee,</hi> viz. If thou shalt
vouchsafe to cast an eye upon this
<hi>Discourse,</hi> that thou wouldest not
only read here and there some part
of it, but take the small pains to
run it through: For by this means
thou mayest understand the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
sence in several Passages,
which otherwise thou wilt be lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be mistaken concerning:
And also to go away with a false
notion (in some Particulars) of
the Persons therein represented.
Whom, should they judge it an
over-bold attempt to give the
VVorld, without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or knowledge, a Character of
them, he knows to be Masters
<pb n="XIII" facs="tcp:50061:7"/>
of so great ingenuity as will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encline them to put up such
faults (how great soever they
may seem in themselves) as are
mitigated by the Circumstance of
well-meaning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> is aware that the
matters discoursed might have
been digested into a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Method; but yet he is not
like to <hi>apologize</hi> for it, till thou
canst convince him, that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Formalities, and curious
exactness of any kind, in <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
between Friends,</hi> is blame
worthy. Nor yet will he plead
excuse for the plainness of his
Style, till he hath reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Vulgar (whose
benefit is here principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
<pb n="XIV" facs="tcp:50061:8"/>
are capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
higher Language.</p>
            <p>I shall detain thee no longer,
than till I have told thee, that he
saith, may this trifle be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to beget in but any one a more
free, ingenuous, and amicable
Temper, he shall not think he
hath cause to repent his permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to be exposed to publick
Censure.</p>

pensiveness and deep dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath made me not a little soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
concerning the cause: nor can

that it is no ordinary Misfortune

so well-composed, and excellently

               <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
               <p>I am much obliged to you, my
best Friend, for the good opinion
you have conceived of me; which
must be imputed not in the least to
mine own merit, but wholly to your
goodness: for I assure you, my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is as obnoxious to troublesome
impressions as other mens, how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
soever you are pleas'd to think
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>None doubtless may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
so well as your self, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it: but if it be so impressible
as you say, I have known you far
better able to hide your infirmity
then I perceive you now are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I say, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> no
man can with less reason boast of
<hi>Stoicism,</hi> then my self: but were
my soul the most unconcerned of
any mortals, and as free from all
disturbing Passions, as is in this
state possible; that discomposure of
thoughts you read in my looks, you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50061:15"/>
will not at all wonder at, when you
have once understood the occasion.
But I shall defer the satisfaction of
your desire in acquainting you
therewith, till I have informed you,
that I have taken notice of as little
serenity of late, in <hi>your</hi> aspect; as
Critical as you are in observing
<hi>mine:</hi> and have several times seen
so thick a Cloud there, as made me
conclude the distemper of <hi>my</hi> minde
to be no whit greater than that of
<hi>yours.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I see then that I am no less
to seek in the Art of Dissembling
then your self; and you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
acknowledge, that of us two,
I am the more open-breasted: for
though you have kept me hitherto
in suspence, and delayed to let me
learn the ground of <hi>your</hi> trouble;
you shall not wait one minute for
the knowledge of the true cause of
<hi>mine.</hi> It is not to be attributed,
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> to any personal evil, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50061:16"/>
of a private concern; but to a very
quick sense of the most deplorable
State of this our Church. It pains
me to the heart, when I consider
to what a prodigious height, about
matters of Religion, our feuds are
grown; and how utterly averse the
too many Sects and Parties we are
crumbled into are, to entertain
thoughts of peace and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When I well weigh in my
minde, what a rare Engine the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
is, for the effecting the most
hearty agreement and friendship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men imaginable, (wherein, I
perswade my self, it fails not of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
success, where it is sincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained)
and then observe what a
Make-bate it hath notwithstanding
proved, among the generality of our
professors of it; and occasions,
through their own most wretched
folly and naughtiness, the sharpest
Contests, and most bitter and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Enmities: I finde I have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50061:16"/>
more than enough to do, to govern
my self as I am sensible I ought, and
to keep the inferiour faculties of my
soul in subordination to its superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as becomes a Man and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
in the resentment of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Had you not the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Philalethes,</hi> to be now before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with me in Friendship, and first
to unbosome your self to me; you
had by this time received the very
same account of that Melancholy
that in me you spyed.</p>

               <p>Though I could never
give credit to the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Transmigration of souls
into divers bodies, yet I could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
tempted to fancie what is more
strange, namely, that our two bodies
are at once informed by one and the
same soul.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>This is not a thing so
wonderful, as to incline me once to
dream of such an Hypothesis, were
it much less incredible than it is, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50061:17"/>
enable me to give an account of it:
for though, sure enough, our souls
are as distinct as other folks; yet they
being conjoyned by the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and interest, I can much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understand how this you so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at should be, than how it came
to pass, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twins
laugh'd and cry'd, liv'd and dy'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But, my good <hi>Philalethes,</hi>
hath it not increased the disquiet of
your minde, to think what usage
some worthy Friends of ours (whom
I know you have much heard of,
though I suppose you are not so
well acquainted with them as my
self) meet with from our hot and
contentious Christians? and how
ill they are recompensed by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
litigating and sharply-contest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parties, for their industrious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to make peace between
them?</p>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that it
hath; and to my great trouble I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50061:17"/>
have often observed, that the Fierce
men (as much at odds as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselvs) can too well agree
in heaping Calumnies on these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and in giving them the
worst of Characters: In which deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theirs with <hi>them,</hi> they have
imitated that of the Heathens with
some of the Primitive Christians;
who first dressed them in Bears skins
and then baited them. The world
is not so depraved, nor do I think e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can be, as to reproach good men
under that notion: that therefore
these persons may be cryed down
with the greater shew of zeal, and
that it may be looked upon as the
interest of Religion to cast an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
on them;<note place="margin">

not received as a Sacred Oracle, that
they are a company of men that are
prepared for the embracing of any
Religion, &amp; to renounce or subscribe
to any Doctrine, rather then incur
the hazard of Persecution; and that
they esteem him the onely Heretick
that refuseth to be of that Religion
the King or State professeth; or, at
least, this the most dangerous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that Suffering is to be preferred
before Sinning. They are chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterized

it is to temporize, &amp; transform
themselves into any Shape for their

               <p>I am not so little skill'd

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>That I can tell you from

and 'tis this short one,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Very good! It seems
then his <hi>Conscience</hi> is the Seat of his

the forementioned Lovely
Character.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It does so. And thus as
we have seen children make an ugly
picture upon a wall, &amp; then spit at it;
or dress up a Puppet, and then make
sport with it: so those, whom one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50061:19"/>
might expect should be better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
make a deformed and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen
Beast, and then worry their
own creature. But if to be highly
charged be a sufficient evidence of
Guilt, who can accuse the enemies
of the Primitive Christians of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
in their carriage towards
them? For it is well known that
the imputations they lay under, were
no better then those of Atheism, the
most beastly Incest, and bloudy
Cruelty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, how can we then blame
even our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Judges,
for pronouncing that Sentence they
did against <hi>him,</hi> seeing the Crimes
he was charged with, were of the
foulest nature, and no less then Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
Treason and Blasphemy? But
as confidently as these men are thus
highly accused, and that by those
that pretend to be of all others best
affected to that Religion, that is no
less <hi>peaceable</hi> than it is <hi>pure,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50061:20"/>
that engageth its professors not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>think,</hi> as well as not to <hi>speak</hi>
ill of any; the little knowledge that
I have of them makes me conclude,
that it is no hard matter to prove,
that their Accusers, in being <hi>so,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
themselves to have the <hi>wide

for; and that so wide, as glibly

indeed no difficulty in proving it:
For what unprejudiced person can
easily perswade himself to judge so
very hardly of these men, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders,
that there are not any that
have better than they, (I had almost
said, so well) demonstrated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
that Principle, which is the
Foundation of all Religion, <hi>viz.
That Moral good and evil are not
onely</hi> such, <hi>because God commands
the one, and forbids the other; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50061:20"/>
because the things themselves are
so essentially and unalterably. That
there is an eternal Reason, why that
which is good should be so and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and why that which is evil
should be so and forbidden; which
depends not so much on the divine</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>This is to me a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration

                     <hi>IV.</hi> That Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter due to the broachers of <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>
had they broached such Doctrine as
the <hi>Hobbists</hi> propagate, <hi>viz. That
all Moral righteousness is founded in
the law of the Civil Magistrate:
That the holy Scriptures are obliging
by vertue onely of a Civil Sanction:
That whatsoever Magistrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
their Subjects are bound to
submit to, notwithstanding contrary
to Divine Moral laws:</hi> I say, had

               <p>And so should I too; but
those accursed Principles (for I can

upon that account; because
we <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> also, that they
do not discern the natural conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences

for my own part must needs confess,
that should I think as they profess
to do in several points, I should be
in no small danger of being, in their

shall onely instance in one of those

many of these severe Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
<hi>viz. That which is opposite
to that I said those persons have so
rarely well demonstrated.</hi> You
know that not a few of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
do make the will of God
the onely measure of good and evil;
and will by no means admit that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>No, I know they will
not. I was my self once told by a

things more sober than many of
them, when I delivered that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very likely; I have
also, and that more than once, been
shent with great gravity upon the
very same account. However, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalethes,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50061:22"/>
God forbid that we should
so far imitate the weakness of the
men we blame, as to say that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the forementioned Principle,
they must all of them of necessity be
of that Dutch Gentleman <hi>Zeglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
his minde, who hath impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told the world in Print, that God
may please, out of the absolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of his will, to command all
that wickedness he hath forbidden,
and forbid all that holiness he hath
commanded. Nor dare I say, or
yet suspect, that they believe that we
can have no assurance, that God will
perform either his threatnings or
promises; and that he doth not <hi>will</hi>
to deceive his creatures in making
the one and the other; which dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
if he <hi>wills</hi> it, must needs be
good: nor that when they say that
God is of a holy nature, they mean
no more, than that he cannot abide
to be disobeyed; which is but a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
commendation: yet who seeth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50061:22"/>
not, that will but give himself leave
to think at all freely, that these are
consequences inevitably following
from that their Doctrine? which as
I said, have the men they look upon
as such Debauchies, divers of them
most excellently discovered the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of; and most convincingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the unchangeable natures, and
eternal laws and differences of good
and evil: and that it is the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Contradiction to assert, that God
can <hi>will</hi> that his creatures should
not be just and righteous, good and
holy; and, those of them that I
know, take occasion frequently, to
declare their abhorrence of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
with all that are derived
from it, or of kin to it. Now, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalethes,</hi>
what can their designe,
think you, be in thus doing? can
they manage any other than that of
convincing men of the indispensable
obligation that lieth upon them, to
love and prosecute all goodness, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50061:23"/>
to shun and abominate all sin? what
other end can they serve by this
means, besides rendering the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Christ Jesus most amiable,
and effectual as to its great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?</p>

what you said last, brings to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
another Argument that
will convince any candid person,
that it is, at least, most highly <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi>
that they are, in being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as was said, very unjustly
dealt with, <hi>viz.</hi> That none have
with more strength of reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
that the grand designe
of the Gospel is to make men good:
not to intoxicate their brains with
notions, or furnish their heads with
a systeme of opinions; but to reform
mens lives, and purifie their natures:
which noble principle together with
the former, doth utterly overthrow
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50061:23"/>
that <hi>Latitudinarianism</hi> they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of, as he must be blind, or shut
his eyes, that doth not see it: And
if it were well minded and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by our angry men, it would, no
question, turn the edge of their zeal
quite another way; and convince
them, that there are too many things
they lay a heavier stress upon, than
they can ever bear.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>This was excellently
well observed of you; and as you
say, if the designe of the Gospel
were well understood, and as well
considered by those men, they would
think their precious time may be
much more profitably spent, than in
contending about meer speculations,
or such practices as neither serve nor
disserve that designe; and have no

beyond the Seas, such as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,

declared their judgements for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I am not ignorant of it:
And me-thinks the Authority of
those men, who were our great
Champions in the Anti-Romane
Cause, should be of no small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with us all; but much less
contemned by any of us.</p>

               <p>Me-thinks it should not;
there being <hi>this</hi> moreover to say
for their being competent judges in
the case, that they were not onely
men of great Learning and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but also uninterested; and
therefore under no Temptation of
being byassed in their judgements
in this particular. So that I say, It
is a most reasonable <hi>postulatum,</hi> that
Conformity to the present enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Rites, may be by those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, acknowledged not to be so
<hi>plainly,</hi> at least, condemned, but that
very wise and good men may not
see it so to be: and therefore may
judge it not onely <hi>lawful</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
but also <hi>their duty</hi> so long as
they persist in that opinion.</p>

               <p>I think it a very clear
case, that the Conformists Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have sufficient reason to desire,
and take kindly the same favourable
thoughts of <hi>their</hi> Nonconformity;
they well knowing how obnoxious
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50061:27"/>
it hath been to an ill construction,
and hard censures: Nor can they
be ignorant what a black and odious
character is by some men given
themselvs; wherein those have paid
divers of them in their own coyn,
and measured to them with the
same measure, wherewith they have
meted, to those our Friends we are
speaking of, in an especial manner,
and more than to any other Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
persons.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>What you say is most
true; but yet I must tell you, that
these friends of ours, (and I thank
you for giving me this occasion)
though, as you said, most provoked,
are not in the number of those
Warm Gentlemen of the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme;
but, as I have often obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they express great candor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad to hear it; and
that they are so wise men, and good
Christians, as not to return censures
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50061:28"/>
for censures, and evil for evil. Nor
can I well conceive how any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously-minded
person can admit so
much as an hard <hi>thought</hi> of any,
meerly upon the account of their
not being of his minde, in matters
that have been controverted, as these
things have been, between men of
confessedly-great worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I declare for my part, and I
care not who knows it, that I love
with my heart a sober and peaceably
minded Nonconformist, as much
Conformist as I am my self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Gods blessing on your
heart for that, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> and I also
do freely declare the same, and that
I think him never the worse man
that is so, supposing I perceive him
conscientious in other matters; and
particularly that he is not of a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious,
seditious, and tumultuous
spirit; but yet such I would not
<hi>hate</hi> neither, but pitie and pray for
them. But now, do you not think
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50061:28"/>
it unaccountably strange, that those
our Friends, upon the score of their
Conformity, should not be so much
censured as erroneous and mistaken
as men of no conscience; as if it
were as plainly prohibited as Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Adultery, and the grossest
sins?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot think otherwise;
but yet 'tis not more strange then it
is true, as I my self also well know.
For I happened but the other day
upon a Book written by a Divine,
that is of a Separated party, and
looking into it, chanced to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an opposition of the Conformists
to the <hi>three children;</hi> and <hi>These</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commended for their Heroick
resolution, rather to be thrown into
the fiery furnace than to serve the
Kings Gods, and worship the Image
which he had set up; he next falls
bewailing <hi>Those,</hi> in these words:
<hi>How many in this hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are caught in this ensnaring
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50061:29"/>
tryal! What say some? Come, let
us rather conform to the Ceremonies,
than lose our Liberties; rather let us
bow at the name of Iesus, than lose
all for the sake of Iesus; it is better
to baptize with the Cross, than to
bear the cross; and to wear a Surplice,
than to pinch our carcase. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(it is to be feared) destroy their
consciences to keep their places.</hi> And
so he goes on talking after that rate.
And though he qualifieth his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with an [<hi>it is to be feared</hi>] yet
he plainly supposeth, that to use the
Ceremonies of our Church is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
sinful, as to worship
false Gods, and fall down to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
images: and therefore, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that Parenthesis, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to make his Readers <hi>conclude</hi>
rather than <hi>fear,</hi> that Conformists
destroy their Consciences, (that is,
those of them that he thinks had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any) to keep their Places. Nay,
three or four lines <hi>after,</hi> as he doth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50061:29"/>
also <hi>before,</hi> without mincing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he positively asserts as much, in
these words: <hi>Alas poor souls, how
are they fallen in the hour of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation!</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You have, I perceive, a
very happie memory: for I my self
some days since met also with the
same Book and passage; and I dare
say, you have been so faithful as to
quote it word for word. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thus to judge be consistent
with the ingenuity of a Christian; I
leave to that Gentleman and his
Brethren, in their cool bloud to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.
But I am sure if this be not
a most manifest transgression of the
law of Charity, it is no easie matter
to transgress it. But let these men
print or preach what they list, I am
shrewdly tempted much to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether they so much declare
their <hi>own</hi> thoughts, as what they
would have their <hi>people</hi> think; it
being their great interest, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50061:30"/>
should be reputed the onely
men, that have not shipwrackt faith
and a good conscience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>This sounds like such an
uncharitable Censure, as you blame
<hi>them</hi> for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I expected that reply;
but there is too good reason thus to
fear: for I profess it cannot enter
into <hi>my</hi> head, that those of them,
that are men of competent Learning
and Parts, should suffer their tongues
and pens so to lash out, if there were
not more of cunning than any thing
else in it. For they must needs
know as well as any body can tell
them, let them make their Admirers
believe what they will, that it is no
easie matter to make it good, that
the things upon the account of
which they so asperse their Brethren,
are against any Law of God: but yet
the people must be born in hand,
that they are so <hi>plainly</hi> sinful, that
he must needs shut his eyes against
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50061:30"/>
the light, that is not convinc'd they
are so: or rather, that all knowing
men, can not but <hi>suspect</hi> them at
least, so to be; but most have so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of their self-denial, and zeal for
Gods honour, as rather to yield to
them than lose their Livings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselvs to sufferings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>You have sufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
your self from uncharitable
Censuring; for surely that cannot
deserve so ill a name, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon so good a reason as you
have given.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And I thank you, my
Friend, that you gave me this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of purging my self from so foul
and unchristian a crime.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>And you have done it,
as I said, very satisfactorily: for
Prudence, no question, is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
ingredient in every virtue; nor
could I ever think blinde charity
to be more truly <hi>so,</hi> than blinde
zeal.</p>
            </sp>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50061:31"/>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But to proceed where
we brake off. Is it not greatly to
be wondered at, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> that
these men will not afford those that
differ in their practice from them, in
disputable matters, any more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Title, than that of <hi>people of
prostituted Consciences;</hi> let them
live never so exactly according to
all the notices of Gods will clearly
expressed in his Word? which, as I
said, those Friends of ours are so far
from living in contradiction to, that
I hear of no clamours against them
upon that account; which I am
confident I should with both ears, if
any thing of immorality did disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it self in their conversations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But now I think of it,
don't you believe that there are
those Conformable persons, that
have given too good cause for such
a severe Censure?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> don't think that any
have done so, by their bare Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50061:31"/>
but whereas there are those
that in all our Changes, have been
observed to be zealous still, for that
which was most countenanced by
the Authority that bare the sway;
and have been taken notice of to
leap out of one extreme into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is, from the hight of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism</hi>
to that of <hi>Conformity;</hi> these,
<hi>I</hi> confess, may thank themselvs for
the hard words that are heapt upon
them; but they did not merit them,
or gave occasion for them, by their
meer Conforming: their former
actings might have rendered their
Honesty too liable to suspicion,
though they had never Conformed;
nor may their doing what is now
enjoyned, considered as such, adde
to the suspicion; but onely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as diametrically opposite to
former actings. And now <hi>I</hi> have
this occasion, <hi>I</hi> must tell you, that <hi>I</hi>
know none of our Friends in the
number of those, that have merited
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50061:32"/>
the opprobrious name of <hi>Turncoats.</hi>
But under the late Usurpers, they
did so behave themselvs, as that
some of them were great Sufferers
for his Majestie and the Church;
and the rest of those I was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, though they were so <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
as to keep as much as they
could out of harms way, and not to
expose themselvs to needless suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and such of which there could
come no good; yet were they no
less <hi>consciencious,</hi> and had a care to
preserve themselvs unspotted from
the guilt of the then wilde extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>You have told me no more,
than I have often before heard; but
I am glad of its confirmation from
your mouth. I pray pardon my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
so many digressions from
the main business, and be pleased
now again to return to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You shall not have my
<hi>pardon,</hi> but <hi>thanks,</hi> for the digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50061:32"/>
you have occasioned; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none of them, I think, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
To go on then:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XII.</hi> Of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</note> They are
not onely not <hi>scandalous,</hi> but very
<hi>lovely</hi> also in their behaviour, and
greatly <hi>obliging.</hi> I never in any one
<hi>sort</hi> of men observed so much of
openheartedness and ingenuity,
freedom, sociableness, and affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as in <hi>these</hi> generally. They have
nothing of that Crabbed austerity,
foolish affectation, or sullen gravity
that render too many of their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
to <hi>wise men</hi> not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
But as the Pharisees
bare our Saviour a grudge, upon the
account of his being contrary to
<hi>their</hi> humour in this very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
so I have reason to believe, that
by this means, these persons do not
a little distaste divers of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
because they look so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
them, and condemn those their
follies, by a quite contrary carriage.
But with any Sarcastical smartness
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50061:33"/>
to perstringe those fooleries, which
some of them have done, is looked
on as an expression of a profane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
as if to dislike that which makes
Religion ridiculous, were to be an
enemy to Religion it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I have thought, that
there is too much cause to suspect,
that what they themselvs cannot but
acknowledge very commendable in
those our Friends, is a great motive
to them, so much the more to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them; as being jealous that
they may thereby gain with many
too great esteem. For there was one,
some time since, that took occasion
to commend a Reverend and most
worthy person that is called by the
Long name, to an eminent Pastor
of a Separated Congregation in
<hi>London,</hi> from whom he received
this answer; <hi>That Iesus Christ hath
not in this Nation a greater enemy;
and that the goodness of his life was
that which put him into a capacity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50061:33"/>
of doing so much the more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The story you have told
me, I should have looked upon as not
incredible, had a less faithworthy
person related it than your self. For
I have often observed that Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Ministers, of which there are
too many, the more is the pity
(though the number of them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by those that gladly take all
advantages to bespatter and fling
dirt in the faces of their Civil and
Ecclesiastical Governours, to be far
greater than I am verily perswaded
it is) I say, I have often observed,
that <hi>scandalous</hi> Ministers have the
good luck better to escape the
tongues of our Carping people, than
the most painful and consciencious.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Any man may, if he will,
make this observation: And truly I
have too good reason to fear, that
not a few of those men are more
sorry that all Conforming Ministers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50061:34"/>
are not persons of debauched lives,
than that any are so: for if they
hear but an ugly tale of any one of
them, they never stand to examine
whether it be true or false, but with
great greediness catch at it, and send
it flying.</p>

               <p>Would you have me, in
the next place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XIII.</hi> Of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> to inform you, how
those Divines in their <hi>Pulpits</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
themselvs; I dare affirm, that
if our Separating people would be
but perswaded to make their own
ears judges, and for some time deign
to be their Auditors, if they could
also leave all prejudice behinde
them, they would confess that they
cannot in any of their private Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
at least <hi>better</hi> spend their time.
<hi>I</hi> am sure it must be their <hi>own</hi> fault,
if their experience doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them, that there are no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
by whom they may gain more
real profit. For none can give their
hearers better instructions, or back
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50061:34"/>
them on with more cogent and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
motives and arguments than
<hi>they</hi> do. I have my self been as
constant a hearer of them (before I
betook my self to this solitary way
of living) as any man: but never
was my judgement more convinced,
my will perswaded, nor my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more powerfully wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by any Sermons than by theirs.
I found that in their Discourses ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
they handled those subjects
that are of weightiest and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
importance: I mean such as
have the greatest influence into the
reformation of mens lives, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
of their souls: Nor had I
ever so lovely an <hi>idaea</hi> of the divine
<hi>nature,</hi> which is the most powerful
incentive to obedience to the divine
<hi>will,</hi> nor so clear a sense of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Christian Religion,
the Reasonableness of its precepts,
the nobleness and generosity of its
designe, and its admirable fitness for

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Those words of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
are strangely misunderstood by
them; nor is there any thing in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50061:36"/>
them, that, with the least shew of
probability, tends to serve those
mens absurd Hypothesis. For the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth properly signifie
<hi>Animalis;</hi> and this word never sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
a <hi>Souly man</hi> in their sense,
but in the quite contrary. For an
<hi>Animal man</hi> is such a one, as gives
himself up to the government of his
inferiour Faculties; or a <hi>carnal sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
man:</hi> so that he is so far from
being a man of Reason, that he is
most irrational. 'Tis such a man as
this, that the Apostle saith, <hi>receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God;</hi>
he being drowned in sensuality, can
have no <hi>gusto</hi> of, cannot relish such
things; that is, while he remains so.
<hi>They are foolishness unto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can he know them;</hi> he can have
no right understanding, no clear
perception of them; and they sound
in his ears like very <hi>odde</hi> things also.
And it is to be imputed to <hi>this,</hi> that
he understands by his <hi>Affections</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:50061:36"/>
more than by his <hi>Reason;</hi> like the
Wolf in the Fable, that went to

letters were told him, because he
minded nothing but his belly, he
could never make any thing but
<hi>Agnus</hi> of them. <hi>He cannot know
them, because they are spiritually

higher principle than that which is
predominant in this man; who is, as
was said, a meer fleshly wretch. So
that this place is so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the use of Reason in the
matters of our Faith, that the <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
thereof in those things is rather
to be <hi>concluded</hi> from it; and that men
cannot receive the things of Gods
Spirit, till by the Assistance thereof,
their Reason hath regained its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and be able to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their bruitish affections.</p>

               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But they say, that we
must believe the Scriptures, not
because Reason tells us they are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50061:37"/>
true, but because they are Gods
Word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive you are hard
put to it, to retain your wonted gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in propounding this Objection;
but however, I will very gravely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you. If we must believe the
Scriptures because they are Gods
Word, then I trow there is a reason
on which we are to found our Faith,
and that a good one too. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
why must we believe what
God saith to be true? must we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this because we believe it?
None sure will speak so absurdly:
but whatsoever answer these men
will give to that Question, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
that this is grounded upon a
principle of <hi>Reason</hi> also, than which
there is none more evident, <hi>viz.
That God cannot lye.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I presume that they
themselvs would give that answer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Then they would give
another Reason, and so still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50061:37"/>
their own Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But they will tell you,
that all is at last resolved into Gods
meer testimony: for we must believe
that he cannot lye, because he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath said so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And what if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
said so? what they would do I
will not undertake to conjecture;
but <hi>I</hi> should not therefore have one
jot the less believed it. For Gods
saying that he cannot lye, cannot be
a sufficient argument to me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, if I did not know that to
lye is unworthy of God, and dis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
him: for how else could I
tell, but that he designed to deceive
me in that very saying that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lye? This therefore is the
reason why I doubt not of that
great truth, because the reason of
my minde tells me, that God must
be a Being absolutely perfect, or he
can't be God; and being so, it tells
me that he cannot be without any
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50061:38"/>
                  <hi>moral,</hi> no more than <hi>physical</hi> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and to <hi>lye,</hi> the same Reason
of my minde assures me, is a moral
imperfection.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>This no man can once
doubt, that hath to any purpose em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his considerative faculty.
But to personate these stiff opposers
of Reason a little farther. To what
purpose is it to go about to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Reasonableness of the
Christian precepts, when it is once
taken for granted, that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?
For nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted,
than that whatsoever God
commands, is therefore to be done,
because he commands it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>That is a truth beyond
all dispute; and, by the way, let me
tell you it is so, because nothing is
more highly reasonable, than that
God must be obeyed in all things.
But however, I would have these
men know, that to demonstrate the
Reasonableness of the duties of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50061:38"/>
Christianity, is to do excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Christian Religion: for,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XVII.</hi> One ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that is gotten by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christian duties.</note>
First, it is no small confirmation of
our Faith in the truth thereof, to
understand the Reasonableness of
what is therein enjoyned. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a good saying of <hi>Origen</hi> to
this purpose; saith he to <hi>Celsus,</hi> in
his third Book against him, <hi>See whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no the agreeableness of the
precepts of our Faith with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notions of humane nature, be
not that which hath caused them to
to be so readily entertained, by the
ingenuous hearers of them.</hi>

                     <hi>XVIII.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the goodness of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel necessary to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to prove its divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> And I
must profess to you, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> that
I lay no less weight upon the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
that my Reason apprehendeth

than upon the <hi>Miracles</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

the Miracles unaccompanied with
that other consideration, a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently-satisfying
Argument that our
Saviour was sent from God, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50061:39"/>
wonderful as they were: but
both these together most fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
to us that Proposition,
and neither singly and abstracted
from each other.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I have, in this particular,
thought as you do, ever since I well
considered the three or four first
verses of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of</hi> Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy;
<hi>where God, by</hi> Moses,
<hi>saith thus to the children of</hi> Israel:
If there arise among you a Prophet,
or a Dreamer of dreams; and giveth
thee a signe or a wonder; and the signe
or the wonder come to pass, whereof
he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go
after other gods, and let us serve
them: thou shalt not hearken unto
the words of that Prophet, or that
Dreamer of dreams; for the Lord
your God proveth you, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you love the Lord your God,
with all your heart, and with all your
soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>That place is to very
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50061:39"/>
good purpose quoted by you; and
these two things are plainly to be
gathered from it:</p>
               <p>First, That we are to consider the
Doctrine it self, before we believe
it to be of God, as well as the means
of its confirmation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That God, for certain
Reasons, may suffer wonders to be
wrought, that is, such things as no
man can give account how they
should be effected by natural means,
for the confirmation of a false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And you have from thence
rationally concluded what I now
said, <hi>viz.</hi> That the goodness of the
Doctrine is necessary to go along
with the consideration of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
whereby it was confirmed, to
make them such an Argument as we
may reasonably desire to induce us
to entertain it as coming from God,
and to receive <hi>him</hi> as Gods Son that
brings it.</p>
               <p>By the goodness of the Doctrine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50061:40"/>
I mean at least its <hi>negative</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and say, that we ought to see
that there be nothing in it, that is
plainly unworthy of God to revele,
or that containeth a manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to any of his Attributes:
but when <hi>positive</hi> goodness is also
therein observable; that is, a high
congruity and agreeableness with
the Divine perfections; such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
make Miracles a more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
strong argument, that the
Preacher of them is no Impostor, but
that he came from heaven upon
Gods Message.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But there are Learned
men, that, distinguishing betwixt
Miracles and Wonders, assert that
the <hi>former</hi> are sufficient motives of
Credibility, though not the <hi>latter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Though these two ought
to be distinguished, yet I conceive,
<hi>that</hi> distinction will signifie very
little when applyed to this matter.
For I cannot question, but that it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50061:40"/>
may lie within the compass of Evil
Spirits power, to play such Feats as
no mortal man, though they should
be but <hi>Wonders,</hi> can be sagacious
and quick-sighted enough to discern
them from real <hi>Miracles.</hi> But when
a person doth not onely perform
most marveilous <hi>works,</hi> but also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
the most excellent <hi>doctrine,</hi>
we have the greatest assurance that
can be from both together, that he
came on Gods errand, and that the
Religion he brought with him hath
the Majestie of Heaven for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
We have reason to be no less
assured of it, than that God is good:
it being utterly unconceivable, that
he should lay before us such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Temptation to believe a
Cheat and Falsity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But there are those, you
know, that seem by their discourse
to lay no weight either upon the
Miracles, or excellencie of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and are heard to cry up one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50061:41"/>
the Testimony of the Spirit, as an
Argument of the truth of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XIX.</hi> Of the testimony of the Spirit to the truth of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>There are so, <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes;</hi>
but why do they distinguish
between Miracles, and the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Spirit? They are one and
the same, without all doubt: for
were they not performed by the
power of the Holy Ghost? And
therefore they were his Testimony
or attestation to the truth of the
Gospel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But they mean an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Testimony, or a secret powerful
perswasion wrought <hi>immediately,</hi> in
the souls of men, by the Holy
Ghost.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But those that say, that
Credit cannot be given to the truth
of the Gospel without this, make
the Devils greater Unbelievers than
we are from Scripture assured they
are. And moreover, they seem to me
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50061:41"/>
to assert that Christ and his Apostles
might have spared <hi>their</hi> mighty
works: for who will deny that the
Spirits immediate testimony is alone
abundantly sufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
But besides, those that talk
thus, do apparently run in as gross a
Circle, as that we accuse the Papists
of. For as <hi>they</hi> prove the Scriptures
by their Church, and their Church
by the Scriptures; so <hi>these</hi> prove
the Scriptures by this Testimony of
the Holy Ghost, but then cannot
prove so much as that there is any
such person, but by the Scriptures.
And once more, if there be any truth
in this opinion, there is nothing to
be done for the conviction of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;
for this internal Testimony
can be an Argument to none but
those that have it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>This I once urged to a
certain Divine, who stiffly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that Conceit, and was angry
with those that went about to prove
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50061:42"/>
the Authority of the Scriptures the
other way; and he readily replied,
that he knew no means to be used
for the conviction of unbelievers,
but <hi>praying</hi> for them.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I commend that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>ingenuity</hi> in that concession;
but nothing could be said more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
to our excellent Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>

                     <hi>XX. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> his opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inward testimony of the Spirit.</note>
I will briefly tell you. I say
that the external and rational Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Credibility are as sufficient
to give unprejudiced persons an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
belief of the truth of our
Religion; as any rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are to perswade a man of the
truth of any thing, he desireth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
concerning: But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50061:42"/>
our Grand Adversary useth all
Arts to make it as much suspected as
may be, and to shake our faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and we are moreover in regard
of the Contrariety of our Religion
to our carnal and fleshly interests
very apt to be strongly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against it, (and we are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
brought fully to believe what
we would not have true) God is
ready without all question, to assist
our weakness by his grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in this as well as other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
when humbly sought to: but
we have no reason to think that he
doth this <hi>ordinarily</hi> in an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
manner, but by blessing the use
of means, <hi>i. e.</hi> the consideration of
the motives he hath given us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
And that he confirms our
Faith, by giving us to see such
strongly-convincing demonstration
in those Arguments, and by so <hi>close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
applying the evidence of them to
our understandings, as that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50061:43"/>
come to be even <hi>perfectly</hi> over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd,
and against all opposition to
have full assent, and such as hath a
powerful influence upon our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as it were, even <hi>forced</hi> from
them. But if all the external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
will not make <hi>one sufficient</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to perswade to assent, how
could they render the unbelieving
Jews inexcusable, as our Saviour se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times assured them they
would? Nay, how then could he
<hi>marvail</hi> (as we read he did) at their
unbelief?</p>

in the Scriptures true, <hi>viz.</hi> because
God that cannot lye hath reveled
it: but that he hath <hi>indeed</hi> reveled
it, the Miracles, as was said, whereby
this is confirmed, and the goodness
of the Doctrine, (to which I may
adde also, the completion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
as being of no less consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
than the Miracles) do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us. And again, that such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
as are recorded, were really
wrought for the confirmation of the
Gospel, and likewise that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
contained in our Books, is
that Gospel that was confirmed by
them; we may be convinced by as
undeniable Arguments, as any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>fact</hi> men have not seen with
their own eyes can be proved by;
and <hi>so</hi> undeniable, that he must
needs be a most unreasonable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that requires better. Nay, he
must resolve, if he will be consistent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50061:44"/>
with himself, to believe nothing he
hath not himself seen. I will adde
too, that whoever he be that is dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
as to this matter, he doth <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly</hi>
believe hundreds of
things, and thinks he should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in questioning them, that have
not the quarter part of the evidence
that this hath; nay, I may say, not
the twentieth part. If they please,
<hi>Philalethes,</hi> to call it a <hi>humane</hi> faith
to believe matters of fact upon the
account of Tradition, I will not
contend with them, but tell them
plainly, that I like it never a jot the
worse for being so; nor can I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how any <hi>wise</hi> man should.
But yet take notice too, that such a
<hi>degree</hi> of faith concerning these
matters of <hi>fact</hi> also, as hath a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
operation upon our lives and
souls, is imputed by <hi>us,</hi> no less than
by <hi>them,</hi> to the grace of God, and
his Holy Spirit; though not as ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
in us in an <hi>immediate</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50061:44"/>
as I said, <hi>ordinarily;</hi> but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the means effectual; and I hope
they will acknowledge <hi>this,</hi> in the
<hi>best</hi> of senses, a <hi>Divine</hi> faith.</p>

that my certainty of these things
can be no more than <hi>moral;</hi> yet I
do notwithstanding no more doubt
of them, than I do of those things
that are plainly objected to my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for I do not <hi>at all</hi> doubt of
them; and I should be laugh'd at as
an arrant fool, if I did; but should
I <hi>deny</hi> them, I should be thought a
mad-man by all wise people. And
yet let me tell you, that we have
from Tradition a <hi>greater</hi> certainty,
in some respect, of most of <hi>those</hi>

for it hath been the interest of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

hath it not been of <hi>any</hi> that <hi>these</hi>
should be so. But the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

not so much as attempted to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
those, nay have taken all for

and then see whether we would

not, with great thanks, leave ours
for it. But I fear me, in stead of so

                  <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi>
that say that the Scripture is
sufficiently able to convince men of
its Divine authority, by the witness
it can give to it self; or, to use their
own Metaphorical expression, by
the resplendency of its own light.
So that he doth enough in order to
his believing it to be Gods Word,
that doth but acquaint himself with
the contents thereof; which I think
follows from that opinion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>If these understand what
they say, there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>them</hi> and <hi>us:</hi> for the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and Goodness of the Doctrine,
we prove the Scriptures Authority
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50061:46"/>
by, we fetch onely out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
themselves. And therefore,
supposing we believe the matters of
fact therein written, we say as they
do, that we need no Argument to
prove them Divine, but what is
therein included. But if their
meaning be, (as by their manner of
expressing themselvs one would
think it should) that there is such a
light in Scripture, as immediately
operates upon mens mindes, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
light doth on the Optick nerves,
there can be nothing said more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately.
For mens understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
cannot discern the truth of
things by immediate intuition, but
onely in a discursive manner; that
is, by such reasons and arguments as
perswade to assent. And besides, if
that be true, not onely what you
concluded from thence is so also,
<hi>viz. that 'tis enough, in order to our
believing it, to acquaint our selvs
with the contents thereof;</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50061:47"/>
that 'tis altogether impossible,
that any man should <hi>read</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and not <hi>believe</hi> them, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
he be <hi>compos mentis,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
what he reads. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us that this is not so, I fear
there are very many sad instances, &amp;
have too good ground for my fears.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> it is time
to have done with the First Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that I told you is gotten, by
having the Reasonableness of the
precepts of the Gospel demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us, <hi>viz. That it is no small
confirmation of our faith in the truth
thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXIV.</hi> A second Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</note> Another Advantage
we get hereby is, that by this means
we learn the incomparable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of our Saviours Religion; not to
say above the Heathen Gods impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
on their worshippers, (their
Religion being, for a great part, not
onely most ridiculous, but also full
of unnatural villainy and filthiness,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50061:47"/>
such as a modest tongue would find
it difficult to utter, and chaste ears
to hear: Witness the Rites of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele,</hi>
the Feasts of <hi>Bacchus, Flora,
Venus</hi> and <hi>Priapus;</hi> and likewise
'twas full of Cruelty and bloudy
Tyranny) I say, passing by the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Heathens, as not worthy
to be named on the same day with
that of the Gospel; we do by this
means understand the incomparable
excellencie of our Saviours Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
even above <hi>that</hi> given by God
himself to his own people the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> under the <hi>Mosaical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</hi>
For, we know, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of almost innumerable Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the reason of which is not at
all obvious. We may see our way
before us, in obeying Gospel-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
<hi>they</hi> are enjoyned because
<hi>good,</hi> whereas <hi>these</hi> were <hi>good</hi> onely
because enjoyned. And though we
may guess at reasons for Gods giving
those people such a kinde of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50061:48"/>
in the general, yet we can say
nothing for most of the particular
instances of obedience, but that it
was the divine will to make choice
of them. They were in themselvs
of a perfectly-indifferent nature,
and neither good nor evil; nor had
they any thing, I say, that we know
of, to commend them, and set them
off, but the meer Legislators plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Now except we understand
the vast difference betwixt the Law
and the Gospel; and how greatly
the later, especially in this point of
<hi>Reasonableness,</hi> excels the former;
we shall be insensible of that much
larger share <hi>we</hi> have in the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, than the <hi>Iews</hi> had, and
so want a most exciting motive to
chearful obedience to him, in the
present notices of his will we are
under the obligation of.</p>

than most I know, to ask
me that Question; but yet because I
am gotten into a vein of talking, I
will satisfie you, for discourse sake,
in that demand. I mean, that they
are such, as our Reason tells us are
highly fitting, and becoming us; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what kinde of creatures we
are, and the Circumstances and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
we stand in, to God, our selvs,
and each other. Nay, they are <hi>so</hi>
becoming us, that our Reason will
also assure us, that the contrary are
no less unworthy of us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But before you proceed

you, as to desire a clear descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of Reason from you. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>I</hi> do, I can scarcely think that

               <p>If they did, I cannot

                  <hi>whereby men are enabled to
draw clear Inferences from evident
Principles.</hi> And therefore when
the Preachers we are discoursing of,
and others, demonstrate the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of the Precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
they prove that there are those
self-evident Principles, from whence
what the Gospel requires may be
inferred to be our duty, although
God had never declared his minde
concerning them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>

               <p>I will, in <hi>short,</hi> tell you
all that, I think, is necessary to be
said in this matter, in these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50061:49"/>
First, <hi>All those things, wherein
doth consist the substance of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXVII.</hi> The first Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what sence the precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: with a brief demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that they are so.</note> 
                  <hi>are good, and necessary
in themselvs to be done; and the
contrary evil, and necessary in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
to be avoided. Those</hi> are
such, as it would be a contradiction
to suppose them not our duty; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
as was said, what creatures
we are, and our several Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Relations; and so would it
be to suppose <hi>these</hi> not disbecoming
us, and unworthy of us. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
you know, sums up our whole
duty in the love of God, and our
Neighbour; the substance of which,
(as is easie to be shewn by enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
particulars) is reducible to
these two Heads; nay to the <hi>former,</hi>
namely the love of God. And there
is no Principle we do more natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assent to, than that he, <hi>in whom
we live, move, and have our being;</hi>
from whom we receive all we enjoy,
and expect all that we can hope for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50061:50"/>
of good; should be beloved by us,
nay, and made also the object of
our chief love. And an imitation
of all Gods imitable perfections, is a
necessary consequent of such a love
of God; such as his Holiness, Justice,
Goodness.<note place="margin">

of</hi> those <hi>forementioned.</hi> They are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50061:50"/>
not required for themselvs, but for
the sake of the great Essentials of
Religion. And it may be easily
made good, that there are none of
them of a meerly positive nature,
except the two Sacraments: which
yet are appointed for very great
ends and purposes; and are most
excellent helps to the attaining of
true holiness, and <hi>that</hi> wherein the

and not onely tryals of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Meditation, Prayer, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Hearing Gods Word, the
observation of the Lords day, good
Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in <hi>themselvs</hi>
helps; and Baptism, and the Lords
Supper are <hi>so,</hi> through the divine
ordination. And <hi>indeed,</hi> to speak
properly, they are no less our <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi>
than our duty; as being Seals

               <p>Yes, as soon as any thing

concluded Faith in him their

               <p>A very small pittance of
it, that is, so little as I am master of,
is sufficient to enable any one with
ease to perform this successfully.
Now then,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXX.</hi> A more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Gospel-precepts.</note> as our Saviour referreth
our whole duty to two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
the love of <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour:</hi>
so doth the Apostle to three; <hi>Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Godliness.</hi>
Now for <hi>Godliness,</hi> which contains
all our duty immediately relating to
God; all the instances thereof, which
the Gospel enjoyns, may be learnt
by improving but that one natural
Principle of Gods existence; and
that thus. There being a God, he
must necessarily be absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
He, being absolutely perfect,
is to be acknowledged the Creator,
Preserver, Benefactor, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the whole world: for it is
unreasonable to attribute our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50061:52"/>
preservation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
such a Being. And then, God
having all perfections in himself, and
being <hi>so</hi> related to us; this will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow, that we ought to
make him the object of our highest
Admiration, our greatest love; we
ought to offer up Sacrifices of
Prayer and Praises to him, to trust
in him, and depend upon him, in all
our ways to acknowledge him;
chearfully to do what he commands,
patiently to submit to his dispose,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is no duty imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
relating to God, but is in
those included; setting aside that of
doing what he commands; for that
alone takes in our whole duty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
not onely to God, but also
to our Neighbour and our Selvs.
God being such a one in himself, and
to the world, as you heard; this <hi>must</hi>
be eternally true, that it is the duty
of all Reasonable creatures, to carry
themselvs towards him as was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50061:52"/>
shewn. There is so close a conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
between <hi>those</hi> Premises, and
<hi>these</hi> Conclusions; that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe the one, and (except he
were stark mad) doubt the other.
We cannot more easily apprehend
this Argument to be necessarily
true, <hi>viz. This Figure is a Circle,
therefore all its parts are equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Center;</hi> than this, <hi>God
is our Creator, Preserver.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought so as was now said, to
behave our selves towards him.</hi>
Nay, we can hardly think of <hi>that
premiss,</hi> but <hi>this conclusion</hi> will
come into our mindes whether we
will or no.</p>
               <p>And then for <hi>Righteousness,</hi>
which implieth our duty to our
Neighbour; that Rule of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>What ye would that men should
do to you, that do ye to them;</hi> (which
<hi>Severus</hi> expresseth in Negative
terms, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alt<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50061:53"/>
Principle, as any is to be found in
Morals. And <hi>this</hi> will teach us to
be just, most severely just to every
body; and to be kinde and merciful
to those that are in need: Now these
two include all that the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in reference to one another.</p>
               <p>And then for <hi>Sobriety,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
our whole duty to our
selvs. The meer principle of Self-love
will teach a man, that he may
not be intemperate in any kinde; he
by this means abusing himself. And
the very knowledge of our selvs,
and what excellent creatures we are,
will convince us that we ought not
to set our heart upon, or place our
happiness in any earthly thing.
Therefore, this was one Rule, among
the several excellent ones in the
<hi>Pythagoraean</hi> Golden Verses;

                  </q>
There is no man but does or may
know, that his soul is too Noble a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50061:53"/>
creature to glut it self with base
Corporeal Pleasures; and that his
understanding is too sublime a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to subject it self to his brutish
appetite: And that God, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
speaks, indued him with
<hi>that,</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>A Prince and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

be the Servant, not Master of his
Minde. There is no man but <hi>feels</hi>
his soul too big for these terrestrial
things, and that they are never able
to fill its vast capacities. Now what
are we enjoyned in the Christian
Religion, as relating to our selvs,
but is to be reduced to one of these,
nay to this one head of inordinate
affection? And in short, (for I am
sensible that we have protracted our
discourse upon this Subject to too
great a length) I know no duties
enjoyned in the Gospel, besides that
of Faith in Christ, and the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
but may be found, as to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50061:54"/>
the substance of them, at least <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi>

as may be particularly shewn,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>What say you to meek
bearing, and putting up affronts;
but especially, to <hi>loving malicious

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Both these may be found
in them; if not under the notion of
indispensable duties, yet as greatly
becoming us, most highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
and significations of a <hi>brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
generous and virtuous Minde.
The instances of the former, are <hi>so</hi>
many, that you cannot be a stranger
to them; nor any that have read but
that little Book (that is worn out in
School-boys hands) <hi>Tully's Offices.</hi>
Nay, <hi>Plato</hi> brings in <hi>Socrates</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, as that to which all men
are absolutely obliged. <hi>Injury,</hi> saith
he, <hi>is to be done by no means, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50061:54"/>
by no means, nor may it be repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him that doth an injury, as the
vulgar think, for that it is to be
committed upon no pretence.</hi> And
what think you of that speech of
<hi>Cato: If an Ass kicks me, shall I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
kick him?</hi> He thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it was unworthy of him to
be revengeful; at least towards <hi>some</hi>
sort of people. And as to the later,
I remember that <hi>Origen</hi> in his eighth
Book against <hi>Celsus</hi> gives two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
instances of it: the one of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi>
and the other of <hi>Zeno.</hi> One
being delivered into the hands of
<hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that had put out one of
his eyes, he was so far from reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the injury, as very great as it
was, that he never left giving him
wholsome Counsel, till he had made
him in love with Philosophy. And
he brings in <hi>Zeno</hi> making this Reply
to his enemy, that said, <hi>Let me perish
if I do thee not a mischief;</hi> viz. <hi>And
let me perish if I do not reconcile thee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50061:55"/>
to me.</hi> Both these shew sufficiently
what those Heathens thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
good for evil.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But have you observed,
that the Heathens give Rules for
the regulation of mens thoughts
and affections, as well as words and
actions?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ask me

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And you are not to learn
that divers of them lead men to
good <hi>ends</hi> in their vertuous actions.
And that, placing mans supreme
happiness in the enjoyment of God,
they teach us to make that our great
designe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I have much observed it,
and especially in the Writings of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50061:55"/>
                  <hi>Platonists.</hi> And moreover, that in
their Moral discourses they tell us
that it is our duty to perform good
actions out of love to Goodness; and
condemn base ends, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some of them even that of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
and a great Name, as much as
some others allow of it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it too. But have you found
that any of them teach men to act
our of Love to God, and to make
his Glory their last end?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>These two you ought not
to have distinguished from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now though I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the later in any of them, as you
word it, yet the former I do. The

Piety or Love to God,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>With this every thing is pleasing
to God, but without this nothing.</hi> And
he brings in <hi>Apollo</hi> speaking thus,
to one that offered an Hecatomb to
him, but with no pious minde;
<q>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But I need not trouble you with
instances to this purpose; for there
is nothing more <hi>plainly</hi> agreeable to
Reason, than that we ought to act
principally out of love to God; our
obligations to him being beyond all
expression and conception great.
Any man may see this, that hath not
lost all sense of Gratitude; which
Principle how any should quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
out of their souls, I cannot
understand; it being, I think, not
much less deeply rooted there, than
that of self-love; and observable in
<hi>Brutes</hi> as well as <hi>men.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But yet I conceive that
to act out of love to <hi>God,</hi> and out
of love to <hi>Goodness,</hi> are much the
same.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Materially they are; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
being the very nature of God.
But 'tis certain that nothing argueth
a man to be so like to God, as doth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50061:56"/>
doing vertuously from this principle
of love to Goodness.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Nor do the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
seem to me, to make any nice
distinction between designing the
enjoyment of God as our supreme
happiness, and making his glory our
last End.</p>

               <p>No, surely, they do not;

do really think, that it is so far from
being difficult to conceive, how

those that never law the Bible should
have such conceptions; that it would
be rather so, how those of them that,

But whereas you asked, whether
to assert that there are scarcely any
duties therein enjoyned, but what
mens <hi>Reason</hi> alone, were it well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
might suggest so to be, be not
to make it a meer Natural Religion:
To that I answer, that you did not
consider, that the Gospel is not
made up altogether of <hi>agenda,</hi> or
<hi>things to be done;</hi> whereas <hi>these,</hi>
you know, are but a part of it: There
are, besides, relations of matters of
fact, and many things to be <hi>known,</hi>
and points of <hi>meer</hi> belief, which yet
have an influence upon practice too:
There are abundance of Promises as
well as Precepts; and stupendious
expressions of Gods love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
therein declared; all which
we are beholden to <hi>Revelation</hi> alone
for the knowledge of. But, in short,
I assert these two things concerning
the Gospel, which do highly tend to
the magnifying of it infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
any Religion that was ever
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50061:58"/>
embraced by the sons of men.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXIII.</hi> Wherein the Gospel excelieth all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> That it containeth all
those excellent Precepts, that are
scattered here and there very thinly
among much Trash and Rubbish in
other Books, some in one, and some
in another; and moreover, that there
is found therein whatsoever may be
discovered by Reason to be becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and worthy of Mankinde; which
are all there expressed, one where
or other, in a most plain and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
manner. And were there no
more in the Gospel than <hi>this,</hi> we
should be infinitely obliged to God
for it: in that, what the Heathens
took pains for, and by the exercise
of their discursive faculty were, or
might have been acquainted with;
we have laid before our eyes, and
the knowledge thereof need cost us
no more pains, than Reading the
Scriptures will put us to. Lest we
should either be too <hi>slothful</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the knowledge of our whole
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50061:58"/>
duty, by drawing inferences from
premises, and gathering one thing
from another; or any of us too <hi>weak
headed</hi> to do this successfully; God
hath out of his abundant kindness,
assured us thereof from his own
mouth; which we have all great
cause to esteem, as a most exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great Priviledge. But this is but
little in comparison of what is next
to be said.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Gospel gives far
greater helps to the performance of
our duty; and enforceth its precepts
with infinitely stronger, and more
perswasive Motives and Arguments,
than were ever before made known.
Such as the unconceivable love of
God in giving his onely begotten
Son to take the humane nature, and
to be an Expiatory Sacrifice for Lost
Sinners; his excellent Example here
among us; his declarations of Free
pardon to the vilest of Sinners upon
their Repentance, and Faith in his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50061:59"/>
Gospel. His proffers of grace to
assist us in well-doing, and his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to work in us by his Spirit an
inward living principle of holiness,
if we will not resist and quench it;
his promises of the most transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently-glorious
reward in the life to
come, to sincere Believers, and
threatnings of the most dismal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to those that shall persist
in impenitence and unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>You need say no more,
than you have done, to make the
<hi>Christian</hi> a most incomparable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi>
but did you not say too
much under the former Head, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that therein is contained
our whole duty, so as that we need
do no more than read the Gospel,
to come to the knowledge of it?
For there are very many Moral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherein men are forced to use
their Reason to the utmost, and also
to call in the assistance of other

               <p>Surely, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> you
could not think me so extremely
weak, as to mean by what I said,
that the Scriptures descend minutely
to determine all possible cases in
particular; for this cannot be done
in Books; they being infinite, and
varying with mens <hi>innumerable</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
But this was my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that the particular duties men
are <hi>constantly</hi> obliged to, are all
<hi>plainly</hi> there reveled, and in the
most express terms: And I adde,
that there are also general Rules laid
down, whereby all emergent cases
may be determined, and such as <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi>
occur, at least, for the <hi>most</hi>
part, with the greatest ease.</p>
               <p>But to go on:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXIV.</hi> To say that what the Gospel requireth is most sutable to Reason, is highly to commend it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> To say that there
is nothing required but what is most
sutable to our Rational faculties,
tends as much to magnifie Gods
goodness to us, and to commend the
Gospel, as any thing that can be said:
And should it consist much, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50061:60"/>
new Precepts, which the world
could never before so much as once
have dreamt of, or of any thing like
to them; and the reasonableness of
which could not be at all, or not
without great difficulty apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it would be exceedingly less
easie to believe it to be a Religion
sent from God, than now it is. This
also makes it a Religion as easie to
be practised by Mankinde as can be:
for all the Duties, wherein consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the substance of it, must have
continued to oblige us, whether
they were therein expressed or no.
From what hath been said, it is most
manifest, that while we continue to
be men, they cannot cease to be our
duty: and therefore whatsoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
precepts the Gospel might have
consisted of, they would have been
an addition to our Burthen. And
we may be hereby convinced that
Gods designe in giving us the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
is purely our own good, seeing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50061:60"/>
the impositions, wherein (as I said)
consists the substance of it, are but
just so many as obedience to which
is absolutely necessary in <hi>themselvs</hi>
considered, much more then to the
qualifying of us for the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himself in blessedness; and
the rest are enjoyned onely as helps
to enable us to obey them.</p>

there is nothing, surely, in them,

admit of it, and close with it. But

               <p>That, be you assured, is
a notorious Calumny; for they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

as are not comprehensible and adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate

that so, as we are to take
occasion from the consideration of
those Doctrines that God hath made
facile, and adapted to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
to admire his gracious
condescention; so from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of those, which we finde
surpass our reach, we may no less
adore his wisdom. But, <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>

that they assert more concerning

               <p>I thank you for helping
my Memory in <hi>this,</hi> as well as in
many other particulars: your infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50061:63"/>
is very true as to many of
the weightiest Points;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLI.</hi> An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heathens to prove the most weighty Points of Faith suitable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reason.</note> and there is
no wise man but will assert the same.
For it is well known that the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
had a notion of them: <hi>Life
and immortality</hi> are said to be
<hi>brought to light by the Gospel,</hi> i. e.
to give Mankinde full satisfaction in
that Article of Faith, is the sole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of the Gospel; our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
having given a sensible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of it, by his own Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Ascension; as well as in the
plainest terms preached it. Now
you need not be told that several of
the Learned Heathens have by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
drawn from the nature of
humane souls made that Doctrine
highly probable; and that even the
more Brutish sort of them had <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,</hi>
if not <hi>universally</hi> a sense of
a life to come. You know also that
the Doctrine of a day of Judgment
they were no strangers to. <hi>Iustin
Martyr truly</hi> tells the Greeks in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50061:63"/>
Oration to them, That <hi>not onely
the Prophets, and other Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Old Testament; but also
those that were accounted</hi> wise <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathens, both the Poets
and Philosophers, did acknowledge
a judgement to come after death.</hi>
And their Poets tell us of three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whose Office it is to judge men
in the other world; <hi>viz. Minos,
Rhadamanthus,</hi> and <hi>Aeacus.</hi> And
mens being adjudged to rewards
and punishments in the <hi>other,</hi> suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their actions in <hi>this</hi> world,
was a Doctrine that accompanied
that other, and as generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
Nor are you ignorant what
excellent Discourses divers of the
Philosophers have of the nature of
true happiness. The foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Iustin</hi> saith, That <hi>it seemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to him, that</hi> Plato <hi>had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the doctrine of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body:</hi> but I must leave him
there, because I finde that he gives
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50061:64"/>
an insufficient reason for that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>Nay, even the Doctrine of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> was, as to the substance of it,
embraced by the <hi>Pythagoraeans</hi> and
<hi>Platonists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several other instances of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be produced.</p>
               <p>And there are other Particulars I
might present you with, of notions
the Heathens had, resembling seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Doctrines reveled in the
Gospel, which are not less generally
known than the forementioned. As
they held a Doctrine somewhat like
that of the divine Conception of our
Saviour: for it was their opinion that
divers of their eminent Benefactors
were born of more than Humane
race, and that they were <hi>ex stirpe
Deorum;</hi> and accordingly gave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honour to them. Their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
of men for the attoning of
their Gods, shewed that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
what is somewhat of kin to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50061:64"/>
Doctrine of Satisfaction; or Christs
reconciling us to God, by offering
himself up as a Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
As <hi>Grotius,</hi> among others, hath
fully shewn in his Book of <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had another opinion that
beareth resemblance to our Saviours
Mediatorship; for they held the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of <hi>Daemons;</hi> of which
Mr <hi>Mede</hi> hath discoursed in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie
of the later times;</hi> and I
finde that <hi>Celsus</hi> calls our Saviour
the Christians <hi>Daemon.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>By these instances it
should seem that the Heathens did
of their own accords give credit to
as strange Doctrines as any our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
requires our belief of; and
that several of the <hi>strangest</hi> of them
are so far from sounding like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
and absurd ones, that they are
rather gratifications of the natural
propensions of Mankinde.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>That the Learned Dr.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50061:65"/>
                  <hi>More</hi> hath well observed in his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Godliness.</hi> Though, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
the Fathers did upon good
grounds conclude that the Heathens
received many Notions from the
Jews, and some from a more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Tradition; and therefore we
have no cause to judge that all the
forementioned were the products of
their own reasoning, yet that makes
not at all against the assertion that
occasioned these instances, but on
the contrary clearly proves it. For
I did not say that many of the
weightiest Points of meer belief
may be certainly concluded from
principles of Reason; or that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Revelation, men
might have been acquainted with
them; but that they are suitable to
the Reason of mens Mindes, being
reveled; and several of them very
<hi>taking</hi> too; which appeareth by the
Heathens being so tenacious of
some, and so readily catching at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50061:65"/>
others upon the first news of them.</p>

themselvs exceedingly with making
Mysteries of the easiest points of
Faith; and such Mysteries too, as
they tell us, no man, though he be
master of never so clear a Reason,
can have an insight into, without
the special illumination of the Holy

saith, <hi>Great is the mystery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>

                     <hi>XLVI.</hi> Of the perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> for evident it is, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
never made it so. He hath
made Christianity, so much, at least,
as is necessary to carry men to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
so plain, that an <hi>honest</hi> heart is
a sufficient prerequisite to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

               <p>'Tis not to be doubted,
but that he hath delivered all those
points that are absolutely necessary
to be rightly understood, in the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and most intelligible manner:
and so condescended to the weakest

               <p>I count that onely
those Doctrines, that contain the
terms of Mans Salvation, are of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity to be by all rightly
understood; and that all such are
delivered with that perspicuity and

                  <hi>S.</hi> Austin <hi>hath a good
saying to this purpose, in his Book</hi>

                  <hi>This is so true, that</hi> Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<hi>is brought in by</hi> Origen, <hi>in his
Sixth Book, finding great fault with
the Scriptures upon the account of
their plainness, and great simplicity:
To whom he returneth this answer;</hi>
That Iesus and his Apostles made
use of such a Style, as was best suited
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50061:69"/>
to the vulgar sort; and that <hi>Plato</hi>
and other of <hi>their</hi> Philosophers were
greatly to blame, for expressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in so lofty a manner as they
did; for that, by this means, none
could make use of them but <hi>Learned</hi>
men. <hi>And I remember that, in his
seventh Book, he tells</hi> Celsus, <hi>that
Plato</hi> and the other wise Greeks
were like to Physicians that took
care of persons of the better rank,
but neglected ordinary Plebeians,
and the meaner sort; whereas the
Prophets, and Disciples of Iesus,
did no less carefully apply themselvs
to the good of <hi>simple,</hi> than of <hi>wise</hi>
people.</p>

               <p>Surely Christ will never
condemn men at the last day, for
not believing those things they
could not by any means understand
to be reveled: and it is matter of
admiration to me, that any should
judge the Gospel to be obscure in
matters necessary; when the Apostle
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50061:69"/>
accounted it so sad a Judgement not
to understand it: for, saith he, <hi>If
our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them
that are lost.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
he saith, that <hi>those that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it not, have their eyes blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the God of this world. Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
prophesying of the Gospel, and
expressing it by the Metaphor of a
way, saith that it is so <hi>plain,</hi> that
<hi>wayfaring men, though</hi> fools, <hi>shall
not erre therein.</hi> 'Tis true indeed,
it is so deep a Sea, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
saith, that <hi>the</hi> Elephant <hi>may swim
there:</hi> there is that, and <hi>much</hi> of
that too, that putteth the strongest
Brains, and most searching Wits,
hard to it: but (as the same Father
addes) 'tis so shallow a brook also,
that is, as to all things <hi>necessary</hi> to
salvation, that <hi>the</hi> Lamb <hi>may wade
in it.</hi> So that all those, <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi>
that affect to make <hi>such</hi> Truths
as subtil and mysterious as they can,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50061:70"/>
do what lyeth in them to cross and
make ineffectual the designe that
our Saviour and his Apostles had in
the delivery of them; and <hi>these,</hi> and
all other Preachers that, like them,
do condemn such doings, do no less
advance it. And I will adde, that
those that affect to make any points
as obscure as they can, whether they
are necessary or not, are too injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

am likewise put in minde to tell
you, that these persons look upon no

that which worketh upon the <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
by first conquering the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and convinceth men of their
duty by solid Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and excites them thereunto
by perswasive Motives: they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which affects people so, as
they can give no account why it
should, to be so far from <hi>powerful,</hi>
that it doth not deserve to be called

do many inconsiderate people
despise them, as men of dry Reason,

a <hi>spiritual</hi> Preacher, were to be an
irrational one; and none were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of divine illuminations, but such
as have bid adieu to the guidance of

                     <hi>XLIX.</hi> A far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                  <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I would adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
you of, concerning the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these our Friends; namely,
that they are very careful so to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the Doctrine of Justifying Faith,
as not onely to make obedience to
<hi>follow</hi> it, but likewise to include a
hearty willingness to submit to all
Christs precepts in the <hi>nature</hi> of it.
And to shew the falsity and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness
of some descriptions of
Faith, that have had too general an
entertainment, and still have. This
they look upon themselvs as greatly
obliged to do, as being well aware,
of what dangerous consequence
some received notions of that grace
are; and that not a few that have
imbibed them, have so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
their true and natural inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as to be thereby encouraged to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50061:71"/>
let the Reins loose to all Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>They also so state the Doctrine
of <hi>imputed,</hi> as to shew the absolute
necessity of <hi>inhaerent</hi> Righteousness,
and that in a more intelligible way,
and less lyable to misconstruction,
than hath ordinarily been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
done. As also the Doctrine of
Gods grace, so as to reconcile it
<hi>with,</hi> and shew the indispensable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>of</hi> mens endeavours: and (as
the Apostle doth) they make Gods
readiness to work in us to <hi>will,</hi> by
his <hi>preventing</hi> grace, and to <hi>do,</hi> by
his <hi>assisting,</hi> a <hi>motive</hi> to work out
our own salvation. And I have
heard several of them do this, in a
more satisfactory and clear manner,
than most, with whose Preaching I
have been acquainted: wherein, as
in the foregoing instances, they have
done, in my opinion, very worthy
service. But some hot-headed men,
from <hi>thence</hi> also, take occasion great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50061:72"/>
to vilifie them, &amp; represent them
as men Popishly affected, and holding
Justification by <hi>works:</hi> as persons
utterly unacquainted with the great
Mystery of <hi>believing:</hi> as those that
make void the righteousness of
<hi>Faith,</hi> by establishing <hi>Moral</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
and that set themselvs to
cry up the power of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to
perswade their Hearers, that they
are able to convert themselvs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being beholden to the <hi>divine
grace.</hi> In all which, it is easie to
shew that they have performed the
parts of most notorious Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and shewed themselves, if not
too malicious (which I would not
think) yet extremely weak.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It is strange they should;
understanding Moral righteousness
for that which consisteth in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of both the <hi>outward</hi> and
<hi>inward</hi> man, according to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Laws of righteousness;
(which I must confess may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called <hi>Moral righteousness,</hi>
and is so in the <hi>most</hi> proper sence
too) for I am as certain, as that the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50061:74"/>
Gospel is true, that its onely <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
designe upon us, is to work in
us that Righteousness. Let any man
but consider the <hi>Precepts</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LIII.</hi> To work in us such a Moral righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness the designe of the Gospel.</note> and
he shall finde, I'll warrant him, that
they are all designed (either medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
or immediately) to make men
in that sence <hi>morally righteous.</hi> And
I fear not to say, that I am verily
perswaded, that if this were not the
end of the Christian Religion, it
would not be worthy of the Son of
God. Let any one read our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Sermon upon the Mount, and
then tell me whether he doth not
think, that if he were now upon
the earth, these men would not call
him a <hi>Moral preacher.</hi> He must
have a strangely piercing eye of his
own, that can therein discern any
other, than <hi>such</hi> Moral discourses.
What doth the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> tell
us, <hi>the grace of God that brings sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
teacheth us?</hi> is it not, <hi>that
denying ungodliness, and all worldly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50061:74"/>
lusts, we should live soberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and godlily?</hi> And if these
Gentlemen suppose, that <hi>living
godlily</hi> implieth something that is
not <hi>so</hi> Moral, (for I know they will
not say so concerning <hi>living soberly
and righteously</hi>) they will finde
themselvs very hard put to it to
make it out. For all Godliness, our
Saviour (as hath been said) referreth
to the <hi>love</hi> of God; and it would
be strange if <hi>that</hi> should not be a
Moral vertue. What did S. <hi>Peter</hi>
mean, when (speaking of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)
he saith, that <hi>his own self bare
our sins in his own body, on the tree;
that we, being dead to</hi> sin, <hi>might live
to</hi> righteousness? What <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
should that be, which he doth
there oppose to <hi>sin,</hi> if not such a one
as is in the number of Morals? And
yet the Apostle tells us, that our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to <hi>this</hi> was the designe of the
death of Christ. <hi>This</hi> also is the
end of the <hi>promises,</hi> as well as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50061:75"/>
of the Gospel; as the same S.
<hi>Peter</hi> assureth us. <hi>He hath given us,</hi>
saith he, <hi>exceeding great and precious
promises;</hi> for what end? is it that
we should be swollen with high
conceits of Gods special love to us,
and of our being the favourites and
darlings of heaven? Nothing less:
but it followeth, <hi>that by these we
might be partakers of the Divine
nature, having escaped the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is in the world through lust.</hi>
And what do those men think it
is to <hi>escape the corruption of the
world,</hi> if not, to be truly <hi>virtuous,</hi>
and, in the <hi>best</hi> sence, <hi>morally righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi>
Nay, what can they imagine
it is to <hi>partake of the divine,</hi> or a
divine <hi>nature,</hi> if not this? Can any
thing be understood thereby, but
participating of the divine <hi>moral</hi>
perfections, such as Justice, Mercy,
Purity? I hope they will not say
that an imitation of God in power,
knowledge, and his other <hi>Physical</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:50061:75"/>
perfections is there intended. <hi>This</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> also (as much as those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
count him their <hi>great</hi> friend, and
quote him more than any other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
makes to be the designe of

(saith he) <hi>dearly beloved, let
us cleanse our selvs from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of flesh and spirit,</hi> (all sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
malice and pride) <hi>perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness

I may adde, that there is not a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
(as meerly Speculative as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
may seem to be at first sight)
but it hath a tendencie to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of <hi>this Moral</hi> righteousness:
but that will be too long a task to
perform now. And, indeed, I may
spare my pains to do <hi>this</hi> at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time; for it will not be long,
before the world will see a Discourse
upon this Subject from a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
person, if God spare him life
and health. But enough of this:
I am ashamed to adde more in so
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50061:76"/>
plain a case; and think, indeed, that
I have said too much.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>What you have said is as
clear as the Sun at noon-day:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LIV.</hi> A righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in no sence Moral a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and
for my part I must confess, that I
know no Righteousness, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
that name, but what is, in your
sence, truly <hi>moral.</hi> And a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in no sence <hi>so,</hi> seems to my
understanding a most perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
And therefore I much
wonder what should incline those
people to inveigh against preaching
up altogether such a righteousness
as this is. They must therefore mean,
surely, something else by it, than
such a one as you have described.
Do they not (think you) mean,
however they express themselvs, a
<hi>perfect unsinning</hi> righteousness; or
the other extreme, a meer <hi>partial</hi>
and <hi>external</hi> one?</p>

loath to think that they mean either

them from the guilt of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>lying;</hi> for they have not the

those Preachers of at all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the <hi>former</hi> righteousness;
which <hi>they</hi> as little doubt as <hi>any,</hi>
that no man in this lapsed state can
attain to; and as to the <hi>later,</hi> none
more frequently shew the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness
and insufficiencie of it. But
I perceive that <hi>I</hi> am acquainted with

<hi>you</hi> are; and therefore can, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
tell you, why they are so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with those that understand the
Gospel better than themselvs, for
preaching up onely this <hi>truly moral</hi>

they hear no talks from their

               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:50061:78"/>
First,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LVIII.</hi> The first Mistake in that notion.</note> That <hi>Christs</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is properly made <hi>ours.</hi> I am
confident, that there is no <hi>Scripture</hi>
that tells us so. All that we finde
asserted in the Gospel, as to this
matter, is this; That <hi>real</hi> benefits
and advantages, which are likewise
exceedingly <hi>great</hi> &amp; <hi>excellent,</hi> do by
the righteousness of Christ accrue
to us; and those no <hi>less</hi> great and

                     <hi>LIX.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</note> The other Mistake is, that
this righteousness is made ours, upon

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You have not, I suppose,
forgotten that I informed you that
those they call the <hi>Moral Preachers</hi>
are careful to shew the falsity and
defectiveness of some Definitions of
Faith, of dangerous consequence;
and this is one of the <hi>false</hi> ones;
namely, that <hi>It is a taking hold of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50061:79"/>
Christs righteousness;</hi> or <hi>a believing
that it is made over to us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>LX.</hi> A false definition of faith they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Which
is the same, as I said, with <hi>Strongly

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>You said that they are
despised, as men unacquainted with
the great Mystery of <hi>believing;</hi> this
is a <hi>mysterious</hi> Faith indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It is so; for I count no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so mysterious, and hard to be
understood, as the thing called <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi>
which I am sure this Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, according to <hi>their sence</hi> of it,
that will not admit of any other, but
one worded after that manner: for
they understand Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in the most <hi>proper</hi> sence, and
not for the advantages redounding
to believers by it. I speak of those
that are truly <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>But why do not those friends
of ours use at all, or but seldom, the
phrase <hi>Imputed righteousness?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>What need they, so long
as they preach the Doctrine? I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50061:79"/>
mean, all that is true of it. But to
say the truth, those mens very unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
notion, hath so leavened the
heads of the Vulgar, that they can
scarcely hear of Christs imputed
righteousness, but they are ready to
make an ill use of it, by taking from
thence an occasion to entertain low
and disparaging thoughts of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
real righteousness. I have too
good reason to suspect this. So that,
to deal freely with you, I think it
would be well if it were never used,
except when there is an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of also explaining it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>What you say is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
but is it not a Scripture-phrase?
And I have heard you say,
that you could wish that points of
Faith were used to be expressed, as
they are in Scripture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It would ordinarily be
to very good purpose if they were;
and therefore these Divines preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrine of Remission of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50061:80"/>
sins through the bloud of Christ, do
preach all that is true of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christs imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in <hi>Scripture</hi>-language. For,
as a Learned Divine saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Preface to</hi> The myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, p. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>If you
prescind it from remission of sins
through the sacrifice of Christ on the
Cross, this phrase of Imputative
righteousness hath no signification
at all; and that therefore there is no
damage done to our Religion, if it be
not accounted a distinct Article from
the remission of sins in the bloud of
Christ. For it cannot afford any true
and useful sence distinct therefrom;
nay I may say, any that is not very
mischievous and dangerous, and
such as tends to that loathsome and
pestilential errour of Antinomian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</hi>
Thus far he. But take notice
moreover, that this expression,
<hi>Christs imputed righteousness,</hi> or <hi>the
imputation of Christs righteousness,</hi>
is not to be found in all the Bible.
Nor in any of the places where we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50061:80"/>
finde the word <hi>imputed</hi> relating to
<hi>righteousness,</hi> is the righteousness of
Christ at all to be understood;<note place="margin">

onely an effectual Faith which is the
very same with inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which, as I said, <hi>is that Moral</hi>
righteousness onely, that those Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>There are but two Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
in all the New Testament,
where we finde the word <hi>imputed</hi>
mentioned as relating to <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
One is the Fourth to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and the other the Second
of S. <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXII.</hi> Some verses in the fourth to the <hi>Romans</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> In the Fourth to the
<hi>Romans</hi> we have it four or five
times; and it is most evident, that
there still it is to be interpreted as I
said. For the Apostles defigne in
that Chapter is to prove against the
Jews, that the observance of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi>
Rites, whereof Circumcision
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50061:81"/>
was the chief, is not necessary to
mens justification or acceptance
with God; and this he proves by
the instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was
accepted, and also very <hi>high</hi> in the
divine favour, even while he was in
Uncircumcision. Now in several
verses, his Faith (which we know
was not <hi>idle,</hi> but very <hi>operative</hi>) is
said to be <hi>imputed unto him for
righteousness</hi> in his uncircumcised
estate; <hi>i. e.</hi> it was of the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was <hi>recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
(as in two verses it is there tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated)
or it was <hi>valued</hi> by God, at
as high a rate, as if it were complete
righteousness. And in like manner
the Apostle assureth the <hi>Romans</hi>
two or three several times, that all
that <hi>believe</hi> in Christ, (whereby we
are to understand such a Faith as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
was) <hi>their</hi> Faith shall also
be imputed for righteousness to
<hi>them,</hi> (without the addition of the
<hi>works of the Law</hi>) as <hi>his</hi> was to
<hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50061:81"/>
And then we have the phrase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Iames</hi> 2. 23.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXIII.</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> 2. 23. consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> But <hi>there</hi> is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a repetition of the same that S.
<hi>Paul</hi> had said concerning <hi>Abraham,
viz.</hi> that <hi>he believed God, and it
was imputed to him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
which is a quotation out of
<hi>Genesis</hi> 15. 6. Now this place of
S. <hi>Iames</hi> will farther explicate that
of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, vers. 21.
that <hi>Abraham was justified by works,</hi>
that is, (as appears by the next verse)
an obediential <hi>Faith,</hi> or Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
and exerting it self by good
works. And then it followeth, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
believed God, and it was
imputed to him for righteousness.</hi>
Nothing can be plainer, than that
this is the Apostle's meaning: This
working faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
or accepted by God for
righteousness. For as it was the
designe of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Chapter, to prove against the
Jews, or Judaizing Christians, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50061:82"/>
Justification was to be had without
the meer external works of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi>
dispensation; and that these
could have no influence into it: so
is it S. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, in this Chapter, to
prove, it is like against the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi>
who were <hi>Ranting Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the absolute necessity of new
obedience, in order to mens being
received into Gods favour; and that
justifying faith must be productive
of good works. Now as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
proved what he designed, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by
<hi>faith</hi> without the <hi>works</hi> of the
Law; so S. <hi>Iames</hi> proveth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
by shewing, that the faith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
was justified by was such as
discovered it self by obedience to
Gods commands; and instanceth in
the highest act of obedience too,
<hi>viz.</hi> his offering <hi>Isaac</hi> upon the
Altar.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>All this is as clear as can
be. But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> is that place
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50061:82"/>

                     <hi>LXIV. Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 3. 9. consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that he chiefly
desires to <hi>be found in Christ, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his own righteousness which is
of the Law, but that which is
through the faith of Christ, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
which is of God by faith.</hi>

               <p>There can be no other
there intended by this later righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
For we learn by the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
verses, that by <hi>his</hi> own <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which is of the Law,</hi> he
meant that which consisted in the
observance of the Jewish Law;
which he calleth his <hi>own,</hi> as being
that which before his conversion he
gloried in, or rather, as being that
which he could obtain by his own
natural power, it consisting of meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>external</hi> performances. And it
is as evident by the verse following,
that by <hi>the righteousness which is of
God by faith,</hi> which he opposeth to
his <hi>own,</hi> and that <hi>which is of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50061:83"/>
Law,</hi> he means the righteousness of
the new creature, wrought in him by
Gods holy Spirit; and is an effect or
fruit of believing Christs Gospel:
For see how he goes on: <hi>That I may
know him, and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and the fellowship of his
sufferings, being made conformable
unto his death. i. e.</hi> That I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
know <hi>him,</hi> and the
power of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> in raising
me up to newness of life; and of his
<hi>death,</hi> in killing and mortifying all
my corrupt affections.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> considering
what hath been said, is it not matter
of wonder, that any but arrant Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
should desire to have more
told them, than that God is so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the Active and Passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his Son Jesus, as that for
his sake he will reward those, that
accept of him for their Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
though they are very weak
and imperfect, as if they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50061:83"/>
spotless and sinless persons?
And is it not every jot as high a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXV.</hi> As high a favour to be dealt with as if we were perfectly righteous as to be so esteemed.</note>

notion of imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
yet now I remember me,
the defenders thereof have a way
to evade it; for they say, that <hi>though
a real inward righteousness is no
qualification required to this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christs righteousness, and
so to our</hi> justification; <hi>yet it will
follow of it self, by way of gratitude,
and therefore will be found in men,

that gratitude it self, as well as all

               <p>I am not like to help you.
To say the truth, it is a most sottish
and mischievous Doctrine; and must
needs do a world of hurt among
people that are glad of any pretence
for their carnality and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I know too many that
make use of it to patronize their
ungodly practices; and no question,
it is the grand support of <hi>most,</hi> if not
of <hi>all</hi> hypocrites. A very worthy
person, preaching some time since,
upon the words of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Restitution, where there
is ability, in case of fraud; one of
his Auditors was heard to say, as he
was going out of the Church, <hi>If the

are we beholden to Iesus Christ?</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:50061:84"/>
And multitudes, I fear, of our meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for there is no consequence more

<hi>this</hi> from <hi>those</hi> mens, <hi>viz. That

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The light at noon-day
is not clearer, than is that inference:
for if a person may have in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate

righteousness made his, and so be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
by God as perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
what should hinder but that in

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But they will tell you,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50061:85"/>
that it is expresly asserted by S. <hi>Paul,
That God justifieth the ungodly.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot conceive why
it may not be admitted,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> that the
word that signifieth <hi>to justifie,</hi> is in
divers places to be understood for
making <hi>really just,</hi> or <hi>sanctifying:</hi>
for because it is sometimes to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a forensick sence, it doth not
therefore follow that it must always
be so. But I will willingly grant,
that it is to be so understood here, if
that by <hi>the ungodly</hi> may be meant
those that were once so; that is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
not at the <hi>same time</hi> when they
were justified. For to say that God
can pronounce a person just &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
that is unjust and unrighteous,
is the greatest contradiction imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to his <hi>own</hi> justice, his <hi>own</hi>
righteousness. This makes him to
pronounce a perfectly false sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and to do that which <hi>Prov.</hi>
17. 5. he himself had declared <hi>an
abomination.</hi> Nor can we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50061:85"/>
a more unworthy thought of
the Holy God, than to conceive, that
he hath no greater antipathy against
<hi>sin,</hi> than to make <hi>him,</hi> that alloweth

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to say
the truth, I have observed that those
men make such a thing of <hi>sin,</hi> as that
it may become God well enough to
reconcile himself thereunto, as well
as to him that lives in it.<note place="margin">

make it a meer indifferent thing in

founded upon the alone <hi>will</hi> of God;

said, undermine all Religion; and
therefore the <hi>Antinomian</hi> opinion

               <p>It may with as great

<hi>God</hi> be essentially <hi>good,</hi> as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <sp>

               <p>I hope they will call it
<hi>Blasphemy</hi> to deny Gods essential

(and such as I can shew you even

stick at swallowing the Phancie of
imputed righteousness in that gross

is: but <hi>we</hi> that know how contrary

sin is to the <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Will</hi> of God, cannot question, that
no man that is in love with it can, by

be esteemed or dealt with by God
as righteous.</p>

but before I cannot; as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that wickedness is as really a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>

now I think on't, how can those that
hug, and are so fond of this ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

Christs Expiatory Sacrifice for the
forgiveness of sins; for how can

there be any sin to be pardoned,

of them that are so, are so weak as
not to understand the true conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences

honest, as, at first hearing, to abhor
them: And were led to like well of

The excellent <hi>Melancthon</hi> was
called a worse name by <hi>Luther;</hi> and
the worst hurt I wish them is, that I
could upon as good grounds return
that answer to <hi>them,</hi> that he did to
<hi>him:</hi> which was to this effect;
<hi>Though Luther calls me Devil, yet I
will call Luther a most pious servant

not now-a-days look upon our selvs

mistake me not so, as if I thought
that to be really a Heretick,
and in a Scripture-sence, were a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
and light matter: for I am far
from so thinking; being well aware,
that the Apostle reckons <hi>Heresies</hi>

               <p>There is another, that

There are those which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

that will by no means endure that
any more should be admitted into
its definition. Now these men, I
acknowledge, make inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

that which must needs follow, by

they make it, a necessary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Salvation,</hi> though not to
<hi>Iustification.</hi> But herein <hi>they</hi> also
fall into the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errour;
that they, or at least their doctrine
supposeth a man capable of Gods

               <p>These differ from the

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You say well; they do
not approve of that mad Phancie,
but make Justification to follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Believing: but then, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
they judge necessary to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they make such a scanty
thing as I now said; and will not
hear of making receiving Christ as
Lord, or being willing to obey his
precepts, a prerequisite to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of that priviledge. And so
their doctrine is too plainly liable to
the ill consequences of the other
mens.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Do they not onely say,
that good <hi>works</hi> are not necessary to

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No, that I am sure they do
not: for, as I told you, they will not
admit so much as a <hi>willingness</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them into the definition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith: And besides, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
that good works are not always
necessary to <hi>Salvation</hi> it self nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as when a person is converted
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50061:89"/>
at the point of death. Wherein
they say truly, if any are; which can
be known to none but God onely.
But then observe moreover, that

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Their pretence is, that

               <p>Conditions must take

               <p>Will they not grant then,
that the Covenant of Grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional?
if it be not, it is, sure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
no Covenant: for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not what a Covenant means,
and how it is distinguishable from a
<hi>meer</hi> or absolute promise, if it be not
conditional.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No more can any mortal.
Therefore they talk strangely in the
clouds as to this matter; so that I
confess, I can by no means under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them; I wish they understand
themselvs. For because there are
so many promises in the Gospel that
run as conditionally as words can
express them they are shie of saying,
with the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace is not conditional;</hi> but
then they tell us that all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
therein contained shall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
bestowed on those that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50061:90"/>
they are promised to; and so, in my
weak judgement, they plainly deny
all conditionality therein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
warranted thus to express
themselvs, by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 31. 33. and
the quotation of that place, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
8. 10. But to these places
we will speak anon.</p>

               <p>Well, I perceive, <hi>these</hi>
also are <hi>obscurers</hi> of <hi>plain,</hi> and I
had almost said too, <hi>spoilers</hi> of <hi>good</hi>
Divinity, as well as the other men:
for the consequences of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
will, I fear, be found to have
too untoward an influence upon the
practice of too many that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them; though they do not
shew themselvs quite so soon, as
those that follow from the former
Doctrine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I wish they could as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discern Consequences, as I see
you do: for my charity leads me to
believe that very many of them
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50061:91"/>
have so much unkindness for them;
as that they would then for their
sakes bid adieu to the beloved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses.
But, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> there are
other more moderate and wise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and many of them men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
worth, who being sensible
how greatly Protestants have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselvs to the Papists lash,<note place="margin">

that though this alone is the Faith

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But why will they not

Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>qua Saviour,</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Because they say Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is often denied to <hi>works,</hi>
and onely ascribed to <hi>faith.</hi> But
they apprehend not a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two, otherwise than by
making <hi>faith,</hi> relying on Christs
merits; and <hi>works,</hi> yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his precepts. But, therefore,
that they may reconcile Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Faith alone, with taking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
(or a willingness to obey)
into justifying Faith, (which they
are convinc'd they must do, or they
shall make mad work on't) that is,
that they may make S. <hi>Iames</hi> not to
contradict S. <hi>Paul,</hi> they say that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Faith must be a working o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential
Faith; yet <hi>as</hi> it justifieth
must be considered as distinct from
obedience. But because it is repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that to rely upon Christs merits,
is an act of obedience, or a <hi>work;</hi>
they answer, that though it be, yet
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50061:92"/>
it doth not justifie <hi>as</hi> it is a work;
and therefore with the other men,
they will not have it called a <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Justification, but the <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

this elaborate acuteness might be
well spared, by understanding works
when they are undervalued compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively

estate in regard of it, and an

to represent, not onely say
that Justifying faith includes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but also, that it justifieth <hi>as</hi> it
doth so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> that
they do. For they do not think
that the Scriptures make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the two foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
acts of faith, as to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it hath upon Justification; and
that not without cause. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. that <hi>neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
nor uncircumcision availeth
any thing;</hi> (he means especially as
to Justification, as appears by vers. 4)
<hi>but faith that worketh by love;</hi>
which takes in the whole of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and there he stops. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
troubleth not himself to give
any caution to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that
they should not understand him as if
his meaning was any more than this,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50061:94"/>
                  <hi>That justifying faith worketh by

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>There comes into my

me demonstrative,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXIII.</hi> An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth as it receivs Christ quâ Lord, as well as quâ Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> that there is to
be made no distinction between
those acts of faith in justifying:
namely, the Scriptures assure us, that
our Saviours death was intended
not onely to deliver us from <hi>wrath,</hi>
but from <hi>sin</hi> too; and it is plain that
this later was its <hi>immediate</hi> end; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from wrath being a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of deliverance from sin: And
therefore faith in Christs bloud must
needs justifie as it designs obtaining
<hi>this,</hi> as well as <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Your Argument will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prove more than that for which
you bring it, <hi>viz.</hi> That if those acts
of faith be at all to be distinguished
in the business of Justification, the
greater stress is to be laid on that,
which complieth with the principal
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50061:94"/>
end of our Saviours death. And so,
if we must be making comparisons,
Faith justifieth as it receives Christ
<hi>quâ</hi> Lord, rather than <hi>quâ</hi> Priest or
Saviour. But however, I am not
for any comparisons, they being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
needless, and nothing gotten
by them.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis most true; we have

               <p>Before you go farther, I

            <sp>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:50061:95"/>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The Scriptures are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
so curious, when they speak of
Faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXV.</hi> How faith is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and other vertues, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or Repentance, or the love,
or fear, or knowledge of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as to understand them in so restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a sence, as to abstract them from
other vertues: but sometimes they
express all by one. We finde in
multitudes of places some one of
the principal vertues put to express
the whole of practical Religion; as
each of those last mentioned; of
which I need not give you instances.
And whereas Faith and Repentance
are sometimes distinguished, it is
onely because believing the Gospel
implieth more than bare Repentance
in its strict notion. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gives this honest description of
faith in Christ: <hi>Credere ei est facere
ejus voluntatem:</hi> To believe in
Christ is to do his will. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
we shall finde that Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Remission of sins, (for the
Scripture makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50061:95"/>
those two) is sometimes ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to other vertues, as well as to
Faith: but then they are understood
either in so general a sence, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Faith, or as supposing it. For
instance, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. 'tis attributed
to conversion and repentance: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out.</hi> To forgiveness
of trespasses, <hi>Matth. 6. 14. If you
forgive men their trespasses, your
heavenly Father will also forgive
you.</hi> To shewing mercy, <hi>Mat. 5. 7.
Blessed are the merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy.</hi> To works, or
sincere obedience, <hi>Iames 2. 24. A
man is justified by works, and not by</hi>
faith <hi>onely.</hi> Where Faith is taken
in a more strict sence, and Works
suppose Faith. That is, A man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by an effectual working faith,
and not by faith without works.
And again, vers. 21. saith he, <hi>Was
not our father Abraham justified by
works?</hi> who yet, according to S.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50061:96"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> was justified by faith. But
whereas Justification is mostly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXVI.</hi> Why ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is mostly ascribed to faith.</note> the reason is, because
all other graces are vertually therein
contained; and that is the Principle
from whence they are derived.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I pray inform me next,
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> what influence it is that

Faith hath upon Justification; or
how it justifieth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I should not have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
this, though you had not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, in the least, of it: for it is of

                  </note>
Observe therefore, That
Faith sometimes signifieth in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
the Doctrine of faith, or the
Gospel: so it is to be understood,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23, 25.<note place="margin">LXXviii The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of faith va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously expressed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> and in several other
places. But it ordinarily signifieth
the vertue or duty of believing; and
so it is variously expressed; as by <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
on the Son of God, and the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50061:96"/>
record that God gave of his Son,</hi>
1 Joh. 5. 10. <hi>Believing the word or

Christ to be the Son of God,
and the Saviour of the world,</hi> Joh. 8.
24. Joh. 11. 26, 27. <hi>Receiving of
Christ,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. All which are
to be understood in a practical
sence. For as the Scriptures scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever call any other the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

the end of knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
so do they make nothing

               <p>This exposition of yours
is a very good one, most agreeable
with the analogie of Faith, and fully
answers the forementioned Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But there are very judicious
Expositors that are led by the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the verse following thus
to interpret this place, <hi>viz. This
is the Covenant that I will make in
the times of the Gospel; I will in
stead of those external and carnal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
which the house of Israel
hath for a long time been obliged to
the observance of, give them onely
such precepts as are most agreeable to
their reason and understandings, and
such as wherein they may discern es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
goodness: and by this great
expression of my grace to them,</hi> (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that which is expressed in the 12
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50061:99"/>
verse, namely, assurance of pardon
to all reforming sinners, of all past
wickednesses whatsoever, and all
present frailties and weaknesses) <hi>I
shall not onely convince them of their
duty, but also, strongly encline them
to the chearful performance of it.</hi>
And then it follows, very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this sence, in vers. 11. <hi>And they
shall not teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and every man his brother,
saying, Know the Lord: for all shall
know me, from the least to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi>
i. e. <hi>There shall be no need of such
pains, in teaching men how they must
obey the Lord, and what they are
to do, as there was under the Law
of Moses, (which consisted in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
that were onely good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
commanded, and had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
goodness in them to commend
them to the reason of men, and
which might cause it to prompt
them to them;) but the precepts now
given, shall be found written by every
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50061:99"/>
man in his own heart, so that none
need be ignorant of what is enjoyned
for the substance of it, that will but
consult the dictates of their own
natures.</hi> For a confirmation of this
sense, see <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14 vers.
<hi>Moses</hi> having in the later part of
vers. 10. put the people upon turning
to the Lord their God with all their
heart and with all their soul; and
before shewed that it was their duty
to love the Lord their God with all
their heart and soul, which you
know containeth the substance of
what is enjoyned in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and was no part of that which
was required by the Law, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a strict sence the <hi>Iewish</hi> &amp; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical,</hi>
(<hi>which,</hi> as the Apostle saith,
<hi>was added because of transgression,
till the seed should come to whom the
promises were made;</hi> not as any
new condition whereby they were
to attain to the promises, but that
they should till they were fulfilled,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50061:100"/>
be restrained and kept under a strict
outward discipline backt on by
temporal rewards and punishments)
I say, having over and above his own
Law, exhorted them to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of those duties, wherein the
substance of those commanded in
the Gospel consisteth, (and which
may be found sprinkled up and
down in the other Prophets, as well
as <hi>his</hi> writings, and doubtless were
more compleatly delivered to them
by tradition from their fathers) he
thus saith in the 11 verse, and the
three following: <hi>For this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which I command thee this day,
it is not hidden from thee, neither is
it far off: it is not in heaven, that
thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for
us to heaven, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it and do it? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it beyond the sea, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go over the
sea for us, and bring it unto us, that
we may hear it and do it? But the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50061:100"/>
word is very nigh unto thee, in thy
mouth and in thy heart, that thou
mayst do it.</hi> By the word in their
<hi>heart</hi> at least, we are certainly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
the forementioned spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and essentially good precepts:
for so is it interpreted by S. <hi>Paul,
Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8.</p>

               <p>I am hugely pleased with

               <p>But however, <hi>their</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of this place, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove from it the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionality
of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is by no means to be endured;
it being of so very ill consequence,
and also so flatly contradicting the
apparent sence of multitudes of
Scriptures as it doth; whereby we
are assured that God expects that
the working of <hi>his</hi> and our <hi>own</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
should go together, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50061:101"/>
causes co-operating one and

as those people say, to co-operate at
all with the grace of God, in the
mortification of their lusts, or the
renovation of their natures, S. <hi>Iames</hi>
did very strangely forget himself,
when he said, <hi>Cleanse your hands ye
sinners, and purifie your hearts ye
double minded.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The truth is, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
seems one while to give all to
<hi>God</hi> in the work of Regeneration
and Conversion; and another while
to make it wholly mens own act.
And as in that place to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
it may seem, at first sight, that all is
to be done by <hi>God;</hi> so doth <hi>God</hi> in
other places express himself, <hi>as if
man</hi> were to do all in this work: as,
<hi>Cast away from you all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
Make you a new heart and a
new spirit; turn your selves and live
ye. Wash you, make you clean, put
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50061:101"/>
away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes; cease to do evil,
learn to do well.</hi> And you know that
I could tire you with sayings to the
same purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
such places <hi>so,</hi> as to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them to each other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And to this end we must
go in a middle way,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXXiii</hi> A middle way to be taken in giving account of mens conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> and avoid the
extremes on both hands, or we shall
never do so. I mean, that where God
speaks as if <hi>he</hi> did all in this great
work, we are to judge, that he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
mens endeavours; and where
he speaks as if <hi>men</hi> were to do all,
that he supposeth the concurrence
and assistance of his own grace.</p>
               <p>But as I said that nothing is more
evident than that the new Covenant
is <hi>conditional:</hi> so, secondly, there is
nothing more <hi>plainly</hi> or <hi>frequently</hi>
expressed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXXiv</hi> Faith the condition of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> than that <hi>Faith</hi> is the
condition of it; and therefore I

               <p>You said that those Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

for this doctrine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXXV</hi> Of their being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going doctrine, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Gods grace.</note> as persons Popishly

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I foresaw, that in this
part of our discourse, you would put
me upon vindicating them from this
high charge; and therefore when I
had occasion given me to do it, I
chose (as you may remember) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it longer, because this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest
place for it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of this doctrine were so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
foul as those men think they are;
would it not be, notwithstanding,
very uncharitably done of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXXvi</hi> A digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning censuring men upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note> to
censure the Preachers of it so highly
upon that account?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Yes verily, <hi>Philalethes,</hi>
this would not excuse them at all
from unchristian uncharitableness:
for they ought to hope (seeing they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50061:102"/>
profess to magnifie free grace no less
than themselvs, and concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
to confute the Papists as much
as any, not to say more) that they
do not understand the evil conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of their Doctrine; and that,
if they did, they would most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and freely renounce it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>If those Preachers should
retaliate, (as I hope they are better
Christians than to do so) they might
call these their censurers worse than
Papists; I mean, <hi>Libertines</hi> and
<hi>Ranters:</hi> for they are as strongly
perswaded, that <hi>their</hi> notions about
justifying Faith, and some other,
lead to <hi>Looseness</hi> and <hi>Libertinism,</hi>
as these are, that <hi>theirs</hi> lead to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But they dare not, I
hope, so much as suspect, that those
of them that seem to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their ways, are at all aware
of the Poison that is in some of their
Opinions; but judge that their <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:50061:103"/>
is much better than their <hi>Faith.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I for my part can truly
say, that I think not at all hardly of
them for the sake of their false Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
so long as I do not observe that
they practise upon them; but I am
sometimes very shrewdly tempted
to fear, upon the account of the
Reviling and Censuring not a few
of them are guilty of, that they are
no better than meer pretenders to
Religion, as great a profession as
they make of it: For S. <hi>Iames</hi> hath
taught me, that, <hi>He that seemeth to
be religious, and bridleth not his
tongue that mans Religion is vain.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But perhaps they may
mean as honestly in the <hi>one</hi> as in the

               <p>Well, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> I will
endeavour after more of your chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
temper: If you judge too
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50061:103"/>
well of those people, it is a safe and
good extreme: <hi>Charity,</hi> I confess,
<hi>hopeth all things,</hi> and <hi>believeth

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>When we can put a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
construction upon our
brothers faults, and not offer over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great
violence to our own Reason,
we ought to do it; and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as proceeding rather from
infirmity, than from a principle of
immorality. But yet, <hi>Philalethes,</hi>
I would not have you take me to be
more charitable than I am: for
though I will not conclude those
censorious people to be all <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi>
yet I dare confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them, at best, but of the <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
fourm</hi> in Christs School; as great
attainments as they may be thought
to be arrived at, by men of greater

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You do well to minde
me of it. You expect, <hi>Philalethes,</hi>
that I should vindicate those friends
of ours, and all that are of their
minde in the point in hand, from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
free grace, and holding the
Popish doctrine of Justification by
works. They are so far from being
guilty in these particulars, that I am
amazed at their ignorance, that say
they are, upon such <hi>slight</hi> grounds,
or rather upon <hi>none</hi> at all. Nor do
I think that an easier task can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on any man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>LXXXvii</hi> A Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of faiths ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to free grace.</note> that hath but a
competent understanding of our
Saviours Gospel, than to clear the
foregoing account of Faiths justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from those hateful sequels. For,
whereas 'tis pretended, that <hi>that</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is an enemy to free grace; I
may ask those that pretend so, how
Justification is free, seeing it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to believe in <hi>their</hi> sence in
order to it: they must at least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50061:104"/>
that if not so much as
that lazie faith of theirs were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But the <hi>Antinomians</hi> will
tell you, that they make no faith at
all, nor any thing else necessary or
requisite to their Justification; and
that their faith consists in believing
that they are already justified, and
that they were so before they were
born too; nay, as was said, that their
Justification is as old as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
for he could be but from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I confess these blades are
<hi>swinging</hi> assertors of the freeness of
their Justification; and therefore
the Question I now asked is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <hi>them:</hi> but I am sure it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
something to the second sort
I told you of, and that are gotten
about one little remove from formal
<hi>Antinomians.</hi> But I say moreover,
that such a Faith as that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
is absolutely necessary in it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50061:105"/>
self, to make us capable of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
and meet objects of Gods
grace.</p>
               <p>Will they say, that the Kings
pardoning a notorious Traytor is
ever the less free, because that as far
as he could judge of his heart, he
looked on him as a person that was
resolved to become for the future a
Loyal subject? Me-thinks they
should not; and that for this reason,
because such a purpose is but neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to qualifie him for a pardon; it
being an act of greater fondness and
folly, than of grace and goodness, to
forgive an offender that obstinately
persists in his disobedience. Or
suppose his Majestie should confer
upon one of them an honourable
Office in his Court, would he say he
bought it, or that it was not freely
bestowed upon him, because his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
required that before his inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture,
and admission into it, he
should learn good Breeding, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50061:105"/>
how to behave himself in such a
Place? Surely he would not; and
that for the already-mentioned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
this he could not but know
was no more than necessary to be
enjoyned him; for otherwise he
could not be at all fit for the Office;
and the King would greatly dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his wisdom in making such a
choice. And as little cause have
any to imagine, that to assert that
God will pardon, and receive into
special favour, none but such, as so
believe, as to be heartily willing to
obey his Sons Gospel, is to derogate
from the freeness of his grace. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that glory and blessedness
which consisteth in the enjoyment
of God in the other world, which
is the consequent of Justification,
cannot be enjoyed by a wicked
man: the joys of heaven are of so
spiritual a nature, that carnal souls
are as uncapable of them, as are
beasts of the intellectual delights of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50061:106"/>
men. They are onely the pure in
heart that <hi>can,</hi> as well as that <hi>shall</hi>
see God. Heathens will teach us
this doctrine, if we are to learn it.</p>
               <p>Much less then, in the third place,
is this doctrine of a working Faiths
being the condition of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at all a lessening of the freeness
of Gods grace; when as those that
preach it do withal assert, that this
faith is Gods own gift, a grace of his
blessed Spirit. They say indeed,
and that most truly, that we are to
use the means appointed us by him
for the obtaining of it; but they tell
their hearers also, that it must come
from God, if they ever have it.
Could we work this faith in our
selvs, and stood in no need of the
divine assistance; considering what
hath been said, it would make our
Justification to be never the less
free: much less reason then is there,
that those should be charged with
making it otherwise, that preach
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50061:106"/>
that doctrine of Faiths being the
condition of Justification, when
they declare that the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we perform that condition comes
from God.</p>

               <p>Well then, we'll to their
next Cavil; namely, that to hold
this doctrine, is to maintain Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by works: which is indeed
the same in their <hi>sence</hi> with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
but it is fit it should be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken to, because S. <hi>Paul</hi> (in his
Epistles especially to the <hi>Romans</hi>
and <hi>Galatians</hi>) doth so often deny
<hi>works</hi> to have an influence into Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and is found opposing
them one while to <hi>Grace,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while to <hi>Faith</hi> as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I cannot stand to cite the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places; but the consideration
of these following things will enable
any man to reconcile them with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50061:107"/>
this Doctrine at the first sight of
them.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>the works of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lxxxviii.</hi> A vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works in <hi>S. Paul's</hi> sence.</note>
whereby the Apostle saith that men
cannot be justified, we are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to understand those of the Jewish
Law, their External Rites and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances.
And so they are to be
understood in <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> the
places in the Epistle to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
And by the understanding
of that one thing, that Epistle may
with ease be defended from patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
the <hi>Antinomian</hi> doctrine.
The chief designe of which (as is
most apparent) being to vindicate
the liberty of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Judaical Yoke, which
being by the Judaizing <hi>Galatian</hi>
Converts imposed upon the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Gentiles as absolutely and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably
necessary, was like to prove
a mighty obstacle to the progress of
the Gospel among them.</p>
               <p>2. In some other places, by <hi>works</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:50061:107"/>
are meant absolutely perfect, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
faultless ones. And we are
told, that, as the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
nor ever could justifie, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of its <hi>own</hi> weakness; so, the
Law of perfect obedience now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
by reason of <hi>ours,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. We may sometimes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>any</hi> works, of what nature so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
considered as meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Could we obey perfectly, we
cannot merit thereby the pardon of
past sins: nay, had we never sinned,
we could <hi>deserve</hi> no reward at our
Creators hands, our righteousness
being not at all profitable to him;
much less then can the imperfect
works of sinners be meritorious.</p>
               <p>4. Meer external works perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our own power in our unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
state, that is, such as proceed
not from an inward principle of life,
may in other places be understood.</p>
               <p>But we have no ground ever to
understand by <hi>works</hi> when opposed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50061:108"/>
to Grace or Faith, inherent holiness,
or new obedience to the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precepts.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lxxxix.</hi> By works when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Grace or Faith, new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience never meant.</note>
I dare promise an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
person, that, reading the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Scriptures where works are so
opposed, he will be satisfied that
they are not any where to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
understood than of one of these
four sorts.</p>
               <p>So that as <hi>works</hi> signifie sincere
obedience to Christs Gospel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XC.</hi> No crime to hold justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works in <hi>S. James</hi> his sence.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I nor those Preachers can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it any scandal to have it said
of us, that we hold Justification by
<hi>works;</hi> nor can we deserve to have
it thought that we have one bit the
more of a Pope in our bellies upon
that account. And why any man
should be more shie of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this than S. <hi>Iames</hi> was, (who
saith in plain terms, <hi>A man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by</hi> works, <hi>and not by faith onely;</hi>
and that <hi>Abraham was justified by</hi>
works) I cannot understand. Nor
need we so mince it, as to say that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50061:108"/>
                  <hi>faith</hi> justifieth our <hi>persons,</hi> and
<hi>works</hi> our <hi>faith:</hi> for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>works,</hi> I say, for a working faith,
our <hi>persons</hi> (if ever they be) must
be justified by them. I would not
that <hi>Protestants</hi> should give such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the sottish <hi>Papists,</hi> as to
be shie of using any Scripture-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and, by being so, to give
them occasion to think that we are
in the other extreme from <hi>them,</hi> and
have a slight opinion of good works.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XCI.</hi> S. <hi>Paul's</hi> language not to be preferred before S. <hi>James</hi> his.</note>
And I think it desirable that we
would cease to prefer S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
before S. <hi>Iames</hi> his; and not
more interpret S. <hi>Iames</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
than S. <hi>Paul</hi> by S. <hi>Iames,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both alike Apostles, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
alike Scripture; but that we
would be content to interpret them
by each other. And then, I dare say,
this Controversie would quickly be
at an end among us; and we should
have no adversary to contend with,
about this point, but the Papist one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

of, and to confute, are
such as either directly, or in their
evident consequences, tend to beget
in mens mindes unworthy thoughts

nature; or to encourage profaneness,
or discourage from diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry

               <p>'Tis strange to me, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi>
that any that understanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe the being of God should
entertain an unlovely notion of his
nature; for not to have the <hi>most

Godhead.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>VI. Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> his represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> He must needs be as
good, as good can be, and have all
perfections attracting love concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in him in the highest degree
possible: He must be infinitely
merciful, of perfectly unspotted
righteousness, purity, and holiness,
(which I esteem as no less lovely
qualifications, than that of mercy)
or he cannot be God. Nay, no
man, I should think, (that is not a
very Atheist) can doubt but that all
the amiable qualities that we see
in good men, are but so many efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums,
if I may so call them, or ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
from those that are in God;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50061:111"/>
and therefore must needs be, in an
unconceivably greater measure in
<hi>him,</hi> where they are originally, than
in <hi>them,</hi> where they are but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivatively.
We learn from very
Heathens that such qualities are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiations
sliding into mens souls
from God, and that they proceed
from a divine <hi>afflatus;</hi> who also tell
us, that God is not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but

                  </gap>, the <hi>best,</hi> as well as
chiefest and most supreme being.
And they give a most lovely descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of Gods essence; and make
him, you know, to be no less just
and gracious, than wise and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
as, I need not tell you, may be
shewn in a world of instances.</p>
               <p>But that any <hi>Christian</hi> should be
able to form to himself an unlovely
<hi>idaea</hi> and conception of God, is to
me matter of the greatest astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he being so excellently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in the <hi>New,</hi> and also in
the <hi>Old</hi> Testament. In the <hi>New,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:50061:111"/>
we finde his definition to be Love it
self; and that the way to be his lively
images, and like to him, is not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to be men of great power and
knowledge, but to be most holy and
righteous, loving and merciful. In
a word, the new Testament, I am
sure, gives the most amiable account
imaginable of the Divine nature:
And so doth the Old too; even when
God appeared in the most frightful
form, did he proclaim himself, <hi>The
Lord, the Lord God gracious and
merciful, pardoning iniquity, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and sin:</hi> And though it
follows, that he <hi>will in no wise clear
the guilty,</hi> i. e. the impenitent; yet
that is so far from being a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his goodness, that it is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declaration of it; for otherwise
he would not have that part thereof
that is called righteousness. He is
there represented, as a God <hi>good</hi> to
<hi>all,</hi> and whose <hi>mercies</hi> are over <hi>all</hi>
his works: As a God, whose ways
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50061:112"/>
are all just and right, and whose soul
abominates all evil. It would be a
very long work to go over all the
places where we finde such accounts
of God as these are; and it would
finde us employment, I believe, for
some <hi>days.</hi>

               <p>You could not well miss
of <hi>my</hi> meaning, nor I of <hi>yours;</hi> these
Doctrines must needs be principally
in both our thoughts: And I must
tell you, that the Divines we are
discoursing of do set themselvs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
both these in good earnest:
And they profess that they do so for
no other reason, than because they
have a most clear sense of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous

               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But do all those that
hold that God doth absolutely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine
men to eternal misery,
make him absolutely to decree mens

do not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No; there are many that

how they can. For if men

must do more than decree, barely to
<hi>permit</hi> the means: for they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily

               <p>I wonder that all should

should those that maintain that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Doctrine of Gods absolute
decreeing mens sins, be so shie as not
to acknowledge him the <hi>author</hi> also
of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I do not see that they
need be so; and therefore there are
those of them that are not; and that
tell us, that to boggle at acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
God the author of sin, is to
<hi>fear where no fear is.</hi>

               <p>I would, for my part, be
an <hi>Atheist,</hi> before I would imagine
such a monstrous thing of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And less you would
dishonour him in being so: for as
<hi>Plutarch saith, I had rather poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would say, There was never such
a one as Plutarch, than that he was
an unjust and vicious person:</hi> so
'tis more dishonourable to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely

that he is the author of sin, than to
say that there is no God at all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But that Doctrine, with
its appendant, will (in my opinion)
not onely make Him the first cause
of mens being sinners, but also to
set men the worst example to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them still in sinning: which
is so horrid, that I even quake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I guess whereabout you
are, <hi>Philalethes:</hi> Those Doctrines
make their defenders to assert, that
there are two Wills in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50061:115"/>
of one is perfectly contrary to the
other,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>X.</hi> That those do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders assert two wills in in God, and the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the others; by which means o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> his Secret and Reveled
will: And though he professeth
kindness to all men, and saith, nay
and sweareth too, that he <hi>willeth
not the death of sinners</hi> themselvs,
but had rather they would <hi>turn from
their wickedness and live;</hi> yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those Doctrines, this is
but a declaration of his <hi>Voluntas
signi;</hi> the plain English of which
phrase is this; <hi>A meer copie of his
Countenance.</hi> The like to which
should one assert concerning any
one of those that talk after this rate,
I am sure he would take it in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
disdain, and think himself not a
little reproached.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>From thence it follows
too plainly also, that God giveth
Laws to the generality, to the very
intent that they may break them,
and so aggravate their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
notwithstanding that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
even a <hi>passionate</hi> desire, that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50061:115"/>
men would observe them, and so be
made happie. And by this means,
most mens obligations to God for
the many <hi>temporal</hi> mercies they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from him are quite struck off,
and made to be no expressions of
his goodness to them, but the quite
contrary; whereas he tells us, (as
was said but now) that <hi>he is good to
all,</hi> and that <hi>his tender mercies are
over all his works;</hi> and that <hi>the
whole earth is full of the goodness
of the Lord.</hi> This is likewise from
thence a sequel too plain and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
That Jesus Christ is not onely
<hi>eventually,</hi> but also <hi>intentionally,</hi> the
greatest curse that ever befel the
world; and a far greater expression
of the Fathers <hi>hatred</hi> than of his
<hi>love,</hi> notwithstanding that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath said, that he <hi>came not to
condemn the world, but that the
world through him might be saved:</hi>
and that, <hi>So God loved the world,
that he gave his onely begotten Son,</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:50061:116"/>
&amp;c. For if the forementioned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
be true, our Saviours coming
was to aggravate the condemnation
of the generality of men (which
would be far more properly called
<hi>the world,</hi> than <hi>a very few)</hi> for not
believing in him, who never died
for them, so much as to put them
into a possibility of being saved;
though he declared that <hi>he gave
himself a ransome</hi> for the <hi>vulgus,</hi>
or multitude of the people, (for so
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>gave himself a ransome for ALL,</hi>

               <p>But what say you to that
of Gods commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> to
offer up his son <hi>Isaac?</hi> Did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he should be offered up? Sure
no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Nor did God say he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it; but onely for <hi>tryal</hi> bade
<hi>Abraham</hi> do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>So it may be said, that
God may not, as well, really intend,
that all should observe his Laws, to
whom he gives them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But he plainly and often
declares, that he gives them for that
end; and moreover hath imprinted
them in mens <hi>souls,</hi> as well as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them in his <hi>Book:</hi> and, as I said,
expresseth a <hi>desire</hi> that men would
observe them, and yeeld obedience
to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> do what lies in them
so to do. And I hope that none
will say otherwise, than that it is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ones duty to believe that God
would have him obey his Laws: but
it was not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s duty to believe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50061:118"/>
that God would have him to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his son; but onely to <hi>do</hi> it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he interposed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But it appeareth from the
story, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe
this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I grant that; but, I say,
he was not <hi>bound</hi> to believe it,
though he did: for no man can be
obliged to believe a falsity: And
besides, he could have no reason to
be confident that God did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
onely to <hi>try</hi> him by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
as the event proved he did.
But suppose it had fallen out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that would not at all have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the case; for who dares say
but that God may, if he pleaseth,
give commands to his servants, when
he doth not intend they should do
as he biddeth them, but onely to
make an experiment of their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to obey him? None sure will
deny the use of this liberty to <hi>any
earthly</hi> parents towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50061:118"/>
or masters towards their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
And therefore I say that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
had no just cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that this was not his Creators
designe in that command; though
he took it for granted, that it was
his purpose that he should do as he
bade him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>What you say is clear
enough: But did not God, by the
Prophet, tell <hi>Nineveh</hi> that in fourty
days she should be destroyed? did he
mean as he spake then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Yes doubtless that he
did; for there was a condition so
plainly implied in that threatning,
(<hi>viz. If she repented not</hi>) that the
<hi>Ninevites</hi> themselvs were inclined,
of their own accords, so to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. And it is ordinary among
men to imply conditions in both
<hi>threatnings</hi> and <hi>promises</hi> that sound
absolutely, but especially in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
and so such are usually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Nay, some conditions are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50061:119"/>
always understood by us in the most
absolute promises and threatnings
that are ever uttered by the tongues
of men; and must be so.</p>

               <p>Your Objections have as
much weight in them, I think, as any
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> affordeth: but, I
confess, some more baffling ones
may be urged from seeming <hi>Reason:</hi>
but whether we can answer them or
no, we ought not, in the least, to be
shaken by them, much less to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XII.</hi> That we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to believe nothing at all, if we may believe nothing against which we cannot answer all Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note>
For if I may not believe
any thing against which I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to answer all Objections; I must
resolve to believe nothing at all, &amp; to
set up for a perfect Sceptick. There
are Arguments invented by Wits
against the certainty of evidence
from Sense; which he must have a
good Metaphysical pate of his own,
that is able to answer; would all men
therefore that han't such heads do
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50061:119"/>
foolishly in giving undoubted cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to their own senses? I know
no man that can give a satisfactory
answer to an Argument that is
brought against the possibility of so
close an union of the particles of
matter each with other, as to make
a solid body; but will any man in
his wits therefore doubt, whether or
no there be any such thing? The
Argument that is brought for the
infinite divisibility of matter, hath
hitherto puzzled the most acute Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
and so it is like to do to
the worlds end; but yet I cannot
imagine that any one doth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
really believe it. And
from thence, all bodies may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be of a like bigness; and that
a Mountain is as small as an Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heap,
and an Ant as big as either:
And this with so great a shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as I must acknowledge I cannot
answer; but ought I therefore to
suspect whether this be not true?
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50061:120"/>
So there are some Metaphysical
Niceties that may seem to make the
Opinion (and those it is founded
on) probable, which we last expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
our selvs against: but what of
that? All we ought thence to infer
is no more than this, <hi>That Man is a

God hath imprinted in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal

constitution of humane souls,
as can be;<note place="margin">

               <p>But you know that there

               <p>Truly, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> if
our Translators had been pleased,
they might with the alteration of
but one little particle for another of
the same signification, have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the taking <hi>almost</hi> any arguments

than barely to permit them. I
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50061:121"/>
mean, if they had put [<hi>will</hi>] in a
multitude of places, where mens sins
are foretold, in stead of [<hi>shall</hi>].
The [<hi>shalls</hi>] make those places look
as if they contained declarations of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>What of that? the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50061:121"/>
of people are neither Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
nor yet wise: and I have great
cause to suspect, that the vulgar sort
have that wretched doctrine insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
instilled into them by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
reading and hearing such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
as these, <hi>viz. In the later days
perillous times [shall] come; men
[shall] be lovers of themselvs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,

be false teachers, who [shall] pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
bring in damnable heresies,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And many [shall] follow their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
ways,</hi> &amp;c. And there are
<hi>innumerable</hi> passages of this nature.
But then, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> whatever
Scriptures are brought to prove ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one or the other doctrine
by, it must needs be acknowledged,
that they are but very few, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of those that (most <hi>evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
say I, but) all will confess do
<hi>seemingly</hi> contradict them. And
which is the safest course, think you,
in reconciling seemingly-contrary
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50061:122"/>
places to each other? To interpret
a multitude of <hi>plain</hi> Scriptures by a

                     <hi>XIV.</hi> Which is the safest course in reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> or a few difficult

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>The later, without all
doubt. But it will be said that the
Scriptures that make for those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
are as plain as those that
make against them, though, as to
their number, there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
betwixt them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But I say they are more
difficult, in that, their most obvious
sence doth, (as none can deny) at
least, <hi>seemingly</hi> contradict the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
notions of our souls; which the
plainest sence of the other no less
gratifie. But however, is it not
much the better way, to understand
a <hi>few</hi> Scriptures, in their less obvious

obvious sence of a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
than to understand a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Scriptures in their <hi>least</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
sence, to reconcile them to the

               <p>I have, since I suffered my

your minde, and concluded that the
Scriptures produced on the other
side must necessarily be taken in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sence than <hi>that</hi> they fix upon;
except we will make them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the greatest part of the Bible
besides: And those that endeavour
to reconcile all other to those Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
make the Bible an extremely
more difficult Book, than I am verily
perswaded God hath made it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no sence of any Scripture true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XV. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no sence of Scripture that doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident notions.</note>
that plainly contradicts the self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
notions of Good and Evil, that
God hath put into my soul, and were
born with me: For, (as hath been
shew'd) I could have no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scriptures to be Gods word,
no, nor yet any thing I am sure God
himself saith, to be infallibly true,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50061:123"/>
were it not for those notions. And
can't you remember that 'twas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
also, that the goodness of the
Doctrine delivered is necessary to
convince us, that it is of God?
Mankinde hath a natural sense of
Moral good and evil.</p>

               <p>But those of the other

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>There is no other way

prove that: But do not those, in so
saying, plainly make nothing in it
self to be just or unjust, good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?
And so, in calling God a just
God, say just nothing of him, (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Quibble, I designed it not)
that is, no more than this, that he
wills what he wills: and I wonder
who does not. Thus you see, they
are forced to make good and evil
to depend upon arbitrary will; and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50061:123"/>
so make the Holy God a meer Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Being, and his <hi>nature</hi> perfectly
indifferent to any thing: And thence
it follows, that it is consistent enough
with the Divine nature, to forbid all
that which by being <hi>commanded</hi> is
now called <hi>Holiness,</hi> and by that
means make it wickedness; and to
command all that which by being
forbidden is now called wickedness,
and by that means make it Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But if this doth not raze and
overturn the foundation of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
no opinion in the world tends
so to do.</p>

               <p>If <hi>Abraham</hi> was of that

when he said to his Maker, <hi>Shall not
the Iudge of all the earth do</hi> right?
And whether he was of that minde
or no, if the Doctrine be true, he
was guilty of a monstrously-absurd

               <p>Nay, did not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
appeal to mens innate notions,
and so confute that doctrine, when
he said to the Rebellious Jews, <hi>Are

               <p>Well, I am clearly sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that nothing reveled by God
can possibly contradict those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that are impressed in (as I think)
<hi>indelible</hi> characters upon the souls
of men; and therefore whatsoever
places may seem to speak mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
necessitated to be either sinners,
or miserable, <hi>must</hi> be understood in
another sence: especially seeing
that God hath so often declared that
mens ruine is of themselvs, and that
their help is to be found in him; and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50061:124"/>
that he willeth not their <hi>death,</hi> but
the contrary; (and therefore much
less can he will their sins; as he hath
also, as plainly as can be, declared:)
And moreover affords them means
whereby they may obtain happiness;
(which, who will not say that all
that enjoy them are greatly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to God for?) and expresseth his
grace and good will to them all
without any exception.</p>

                  <hi>You have put me in
minde of a passage I have met with
in a Sermon of a most pious and
learned Divine now in heaven;
which, when I read it, did greatly
affect me. It is this:</hi> Consider im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
with your selvs, what an
unreasonable, horrible thing it is,
seeing there are so many several fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
expressions of Gods general
love, and gracious favour to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
inforced and strengthened with
such protestations, and solemn oaths,
that the cunningest Linguist of you
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50061:125"/>
all cannot, in your whole lives study,
conceive or frame expressions more
full and satisfactory. I say, is it
not desperate madness, for a man to
shew such hatred and abomination at
the comfortable and gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of God, that he can be content to
spend almost his whole age in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and hunting after interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
utterly contradicting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the plain apparent sence of
those Scriptures: And will be glad,
and heartily comforted, to hear ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of a new-found-out gloss, to
pervert, and rack, and torment Gods
holy Word.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Me-thinks this passage
should affect any good man. But,
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> what should induce so
many to be led by a few Scriptures
against such a torrent of others, to
cry up such strange Doctrine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You love to ask <hi>me</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
which you can answer as well
your self: You know they pretend
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50061:125"/>
that this is the onely way to advance
Gods grace in mens conversion
and salvation.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XVII.</hi> What is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the good men of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion to go that way.</note> And this, no doubt,
is the onely motive that prevaileth
with all the truly <hi>good</hi> men among
them to go that way. It sounds as
harsh in many, at least, of <hi>their</hi> ears,
as it doth in <hi>ours;</hi> as I have great
reason to be assured. And <hi>Calvin</hi>
himself, in the 608 page of his <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi>
calls Absolute Reprobation
<hi>Horribile Decretum:</hi> And the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of the Synod at <hi>Dort</hi> said it
was <hi>materia odiosa;</hi> and therefore
declared to the Remonstrants that
that Controversie should be waved,
and said that they would onely hear
their Arguments against Absolute
Election, for that was <hi>materia sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis.</hi>
As I finde in their Letters cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Epistolae Ecclesiasticae, &amp;c.</hi> I
say, it is very <hi>harsh</hi> doctrine to many
of <hi>them</hi> as well as to <hi>us;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot otherwise than by
admitting it, magnifie, as they think
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50061:126"/>
they ought, the divine grace to Gods
elect, they force themselvs to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the bitter Pill, as much as their
stomacks nauseate it; and therefore,
as those that drink down loathsome
Potions stop their <hi>noses,</hi> so do these
their <hi>ears</hi> to the clamours of their
own Reason against it; and will not
sedately advert to, but violently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the natural dictates of their
understandings. Have you not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times observed that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured

more than others of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
thoughts? I am sure I have;
and have found when I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
with them, that this doctrine
was the occasion of them. So that
whether they will or no, their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or innate sense of their Souls
(call it which you please) suggests
to them the dreadful consequences
of it, which they would fain believe
to be the devils temptations.</p>

               <p>But don't you believe,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50061:126"/>
that the men of this opinion are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

               <p>I do not think that the

that those should think, that
such Scriptures are unintelligible in
any other sence than that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them in, that know how
<hi>few,</hi> and therefore how <hi>ambiguous</hi>
the original words of the Hebrew
Tongue are, as also that there are
different sences of the same Verb in
several Conjugations; and that
there are strange Idioms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
of speech in that Language,
which are also imitated in the Greek
Testament; and lastly, that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of several passages do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
make another sence neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be imposed on them, from
that which at first sight, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I have sometimes thought,
that those need never despair of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the places they produce
to serve their <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
sence from that they are so fond
of, who can invent a Figure to make
<hi>All</hi> men, nay and <hi>every</hi> man too, to

<hi>I will not the death of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
with <hi>I desire the death of most

to be SAVED,</hi> with <hi>He will have the
generality of men to be DAMNED;</hi>
and many the like Propositions
which sound in <hi>my</hi> ears as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
one to the other, as any I have
ever heard or can invent. So that,
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> it must needs be, as you
said, their desire to magnifie Gods
grace to the Elect, that alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
with those of them that are
good-natured &amp; truly-pious people
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50061:127"/>
to go that way. But yet I wonder
that they should no more consider,
that, to magnifie Gods grace to some
few, so as to deny it to all others;
and so to advance his <hi>mercy,</hi> as to rob
him of his <hi>holiness, truth</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi>
is to take ten thousand times more
from him, than is given thereby to
him.</p>

               <p>I would advance Gods

<hi>they</hi>) desire to attribute any more
to man, in the business of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than needs must, and not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him a perfect Brute. But to
say the truth, I, and those I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with of those Divines, do
magnifie in all respects the grace of
God, as much as any of the other

which, in short, is this: That there
is such a thing as distinguishing
grace, whereby some persons are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
elected, by vertue whereof
they shall be (having potent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
means prepared for them)
irresistibly saved. But that others,
that are not in the number of those
singular and special favourites, are
not at all in a desperate condition,
but have sufficient means appointed
for them to qualifie them for greater
or less degrees of happiness, and
have sufficient grace offered to them
some way or other, and some time or
other; and are in a capacity of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
either greater or less through
the merits of Jesus Christ; and that
none of them are damned but those
that wilfully refuse to co-operate
with that grace of God, and will not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50061:128"/>
act in some moral sutableness to that
power they have received. And as
for those that have been in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner wrought upon, and
finde themselvs very powerfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
and carried to that which is
good; such at least have reason, so
long as they are also careful to walk
in all ways of holiness, to believe
themselvs in the number of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
elected. <hi>Now</hi> (as a learned
Divine saith) <hi>the Arminian need not
repine at this way, nor yet the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist:
for whatsoever good Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism
pretends to concerning all
men, is exhibited to the part not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
elected; and to the other part,
the goodness of God is greater than
is allotted by</hi> Arminius: <hi>And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
good is pretended in Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
to that part that is absolutely
elected, the same goodness is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited;
and besides, that direful

               <p>I am glad to understand
that you and they have made choice
of this way; which is not new to
me, (no more than another Middle
way, which I cannot be satisfied
with) but for some time I have been
greatly inclined to prefer this before
any other, as having by much the
fewest and least difficulties.</p>

               <p>I did not think you a
stranger to it, and believed you
could not but like well of it; nor
can I conceive why either any <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinist</hi>
or <hi>Remonstrant</hi> should mislike
it. But that we see in all professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there are those that will hardly
be brought to allow that there may
be any farther improvements made,
than those which their great Masters
had attained to. Though both <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
and <hi>Arminius</hi> were excellently-learned
and pious persons, yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
their respective greatest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50061:129"/>
should acknowledge each of
them short of infallibility, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not presume them in any thing
attained to a <hi>Nè plus ultra.</hi> Every
Age, sure enough, improveth in
knowledge, having the help still of
those foregoing: and as this is seen
in other Sciences, so especially is it
discernible in that of Divinity; as
all but ignorant, and extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
persons must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

               <p>The same person (as I
am informed by one that hath read
it) hath also written a very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50061:130"/>
he layeth down, and defendeth very

            <sp>

               <p>But indeed, if I did not

our Saviour and his Apostles, I
should not have, at all, given credit
to it.</p>

                  <hi>Id verum
quod antiquissimum,</hi> being in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

I verily believe that this way is
much more befriended by the great

than any other. But how it should,
if true, have for some Ages the <hi>few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi>

For <hi>Truth</hi> is too <hi>frequently,</hi> if not

               <p>This way,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXI.</hi> This way a great ease to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> his mind.</note> I must tell
you, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> hath, for divers
years, been a mighty ease to my
minde: And I will communicate to
you something concerning my self,
that I never, before now, had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
to tell you. The Doctrine of
Absolute Reprobation did ever since
I was of years of discretion lie very
unevenly and ruggedly in my brains;
and seemed extremely harsh to me.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50061:131"/>
And though I for some time thought
that I was bound to believe it; yet
could I not endure much to <hi>think,</hi>
or to hear others <hi>talk</hi> of it. But
after I betook my self to studie the
Controversie, I had so quick a sense
of the natural consequences of it, as
did greatly distract me: For I was
fearful of letting go the Premise, as
much as the Conclusions scar'd me.
But while I <hi>thought,</hi> or rather <hi>feared</hi>
that the Doctrine was too too true;
I was frequently disquieted with
blasphemous thoughts, and most
black apprehensions of the loveliest
of Beings; nor could I think of
God many times without consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Those thoughts I was ready
to look upon as injections from <hi>his</hi>
and <hi>Mankindes</hi> enemy: Till at
length, after I had weighed things
more impartially, (having read a
Book or two that prepared me with
some free Principles) I found that I
had wrong'd the Devil, and that my
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50061:131"/>
affrighting thoughts were the too
natural off-spring of that Principle:
And came to be convinced that till I
let go this, I was not like to be rid
of them. But then I was as much
to seek where to fix, and how to
steer my self, as to the doctrine of
Election; (for very fearful I was to
entertain any opinion that might at
all lessen Gods grace to any) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
for a while I was well pleased
with that Middle way you now gave
an intimation of; till after better
weighing it, I found but very little,
if any thing, gotten by it. Then I
fell to considering that other I have
given you an account of, and have
ever since been as well <hi>satisfied</hi>
with <hi>this,</hi> as I was with <hi>that dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi>
And so I took my leave of
the forementioned Principle, and
was thereupon, I thank God, well
rid of its troublesome attendants.
For some time I could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that those sad consequences
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50061:132"/>
were so fast tyed to that opinion,
but that they might be loosed from
each other: whereupon I set my
very <hi>teeth</hi> to the knot, and tryed all
my skill to undo it; but when I
found that it was labour in vain, I
was, as I said, chiefly encouraged by
the acquaintance I took with <hi>this</hi>
way, to send both Principle and
Conclusions packing together; and
so bade them all <hi>Goodnight.</hi>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And have you not found,
<hi>Philalethes,</hi> that since you exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Calvinistical</hi> for <hi>this</hi> way,
you love God better than before,
and can think of him with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and pleasure?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I thank God; And
whereas before I loved him chiefly
from some hopes I had that he loved
me; I can now love him for himself,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50061:132"/>
and the consideration of the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of his nature, and essential
perfections: And therefore my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to him is more constant, than
it was while it chiefly depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the apprehension I had of his
affecting me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>So it must, I should think,
needs be; although you still loved
<hi>him</hi> onely in regard of his love to
<hi>you:</hi> For though you may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
possibly, be without any great
sense of his love of <hi>complacence,</hi> yet
I dare say you now never want that
of his love of <hi>benevolence.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <l>No never.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>You have also a clearer
sense of the goodness of the divine
precepts, and of the hatefulness and
vileness of sin, han't you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, a much clearer;
which <hi>I</hi> hope hath some good influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon my life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>So your <hi>love</hi> alone must

and <hi>this</hi> together.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> what
a Catechist are you grown all of a
suddain? <hi>I</hi> pray desist from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any more Questions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Did <hi>I</hi> not so well know you,
<hi>I</hi> should have done but foolishly in
thus freely answering those you
have ask'd me: And had <hi>I</hi> of mine
own accord told you, what you have
now heard, you your self would
have accounted me too guilty of
boasting and vain-glory. But yet
though (thanks be to Gods grace) I
am somewhat better than <hi>I</hi> have
been; yet am <hi>I</hi> still sensible of so
much weakness, of such great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure
of thoughts, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derliness
of affections, as may well
keep me exceedingly low in mine
own eyes, and Antidote me from
pride and conceitedness in regard
of my attainments, (were they
greater than they are) even though
<hi>I</hi> should onely be beholden to my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50061:133"/>
own strength for them. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you are so good at Catechizing,
why may not <hi>I</hi> be so also?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>So you have been, I
think, <hi>sufficiently,</hi> since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this discourse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But why may not I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
to <hi>you</hi> your own Questions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But you have time lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
enough, at present, for other
matters: don't you see? the Sun
grows low.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, to pursue
more closely the business in hand:
Do not our Adversaries in this point
accuse those Friends of ours of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism</hi>
in asserting <hi>Free-will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXIII.</hi> Of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</note>
notwithstanding that their Middle
way?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>This way teacheth us to
assert no <hi>Free-will</hi> that is opposite
to <hi>Free-grace:</hi> And onely thus
much, that men are invested by
God with ability to do much in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to salvation; as, to abstain from
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50061:134"/>
the external acts of sin, to hear his
Word, read it and consider it, and
to <hi>endeavour</hi> to subdue all their
lusts, and perform whatsoever duties
are required of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
likewise by the infinitely-strong
motives contained in the Gospel, by
the motions of his holy Spirit, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
providences, or in one word, by
his preventing grace, may they <hi>will</hi>
so to do. But that we can, of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
turn our own wills from the
ways of sin to the ways of God, is
peremptorily denyed by us; and,
for ought that I can learn, by the
<hi>Remonstrants</hi> themselvs also; as
much as they are accused by some
for so asserting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But don't we see that the
generality of men that enjoy the
means of grace are never the better
for them, but continue in wilful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis too true, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of saddest lamentation: but
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50061:134"/>
what of that? Let us, in Gods
name, charge it wholly upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs;
and not say, they are not able
to do otherwise: if this were so, I
should think it the greatest folly in
the world to be angry with a wicked
man. Don't we see that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of an <hi>easie</hi> punishment, or the
promise of a <hi>small</hi> reward, will make
men finde a <hi>will</hi> to abstain from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sins, which they would not be
kept from by all the threatnings and
promises in the Book of God?
Therefore, surely, by the help of
these, (and especially if we take the
other helps along with them, that
were but now named) they may <hi>will</hi>
not onely to <hi>keep</hi> from some sins,
but also to <hi>endeavour</hi> to keep
from all. Mens Wills being so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
wrought upon, doth not prove
that they have no power to will thus
to do: For we see that it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same thing as to all other habits,
as well as sinful ones: there is not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50061:135"/>
one among <hi>many,</hi> scarcely, that will
be broken of such Customs as are in
themselvs very <hi>innocent,</hi> no, though
they finde them prejudicial to them;
as I need not give you instances.
But then for so few mens being
throughly converted by the means
of grace, let us much less run to
Gods absolute decreeing their non-conversion
or damnation to give a
Solution of it. Nor let us so wrong
God, as to say that it is any way long
of him, or that he hath been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them; and by this means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them. What reason have we
to imagine that they are not <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs</hi>
in all the fault? and that God
would not have given them such a
measure of grace, as would have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
converted them, had they
but acted in some sutableness to the
power he hath given them? Had
they but done what they <hi>could,</hi> and
might have <hi>willed</hi> to have done too,
but that they <hi>freely</hi> chose the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50061:135"/>
And against the checks of
their own Consciences, and all the
methods of Gods grace, with a <hi>free,</hi>
not <hi>fatal</hi> willingness, preferred the
pleasing of their senses before the
salvation of their souls. God hath
said enough to perswade us not to
imagine this; as may be largely
shewn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I could never hear the
most wicked wretch, when he is
wisest, and most himself, (I mean
when on his death-bed, or under
some smart affliction) either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of God, or curse <hi>Adam</hi> for
his neglect of the means of grace,
and unmindfulness of his precious
soul: And those of them whose
consciences are awakened do ever
lay the blame on <hi>themselvs</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
of their carelesness and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
And not at all, I say, either
on their Creator or first parents; as
if by the one or the other they were
brought into so sad a condition, as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50061:136"/>
to be under an impossibility of so
much as <hi>willing</hi> to do otherwise.
But <hi>then</hi> they are heard to <hi>befool
themselvs</hi> exceedingly, and to make
God a many fair promises how good
they will be, if he'll but please
to prolong their lives, or remove
their afflictions: which is a plain
Argument, that (whatsoever speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
shews of Reason any of them
might once have pleased themselvs
with, for their being under a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of behaving themselvs as they
did) their own experience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sense of their souls undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assures them, now that they have
leisure sedately to consult them, that
they are much freer creatures than
they were once willing to fancy
themselvs to be.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That one Argument

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>But we see, <hi>Theophilus,</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:50061:136"/>
whither too many of <hi>those</hi> are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
that deny all freedom of will
in unregenerate men, as to that
which is good: for, I think I may
say, that even <hi>all</hi> those that best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
themselvs in that way, do
also oppose this Liberty as to all the
actions of all men: wherein they are
not a little beholden to Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
as hard an opinion as too deservedly
they have of him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But the Philosophical
subtilties whereby that Gentleman
and his Brethren in this point, have
defended that opinion, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
confuted by the contrary
and confessed sense of almost all
Mankinde, and by the knowledge
we have of our own souls. For we
are able at any time to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment

in our Wills, and that they are nor
blinde powers necessarily following
the dictates of our Understandings;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50061:137"/>
(the Will being doubtless no really-distinct
faculty from the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

the Soul it self, as it simply <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands</hi>

it is called the <hi>Will</hi>). For we finde
that we are able to will to do what
we know ought not to be done, and
to omit what we are assured we
ought to do: I say, we finde this by
sad experience; and therefore when
we do thus, our Wills contradict and
disobey the dictates of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
And if this were not so,
(let those men say what they can)
there could be no such thing as a sin
against Conscience.</p>

               <p>Yes verily. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I said, that this strange opinion is
against the sense of <hi>almost</hi> all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
I think I spake too modestly,
and might have spared that [<hi>almost</hi>].
For I cannot imagine that those men
themselvs, that are the greatest Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
for the Doctrine of mens Wills
being under a fatal necessity, either
by the means of Gods Decrees, or
upon any other account; (I say, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine that) they really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it themselvs, except in some
certain Fits; as confidently as they
may talk or write (I will not say to
shew their parts, but) to manage a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation.
For they will as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool
and vex at themselvs when they
are sensible they have done amiss, as
other folk. But how a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or the reflecting of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50061:138"/>
should trouble him, so as to
make him condemn himself; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by any means understand, if he
be not at the same time conscious to
himself, that he might have done
otherwise.</p>

               <p>But we have all this
while, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> been discoursing
onely of such as enjoy the means of
grace; but what say you to the
Heathens, that never heard of Christ,
or saw one letter of the Bible? Are
not they under a fatal necessity of
being damned? And is not God
wanting to them, think you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>To say the truth, many
of them, for all their not having
heard of Christ, and their being
strangers to the Bible, have out-done
most <hi>Christians,</hi> to our great shame
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50061:139"/>
be it spoken. But, I say, that God
is not nor hath not been wanting to
them neither, as to the enabling
them to do so much, as he expects
from them; and so making them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of some lower degrees of
happiness. Hath not our Saviour
told us, that <hi>where little is given,
but little shall be required?</hi> And I
have heard of a meer Natural Fool,
that on his death-bed said, <hi>Lord,
where thou givest but little, thou
dost not expect much.</hi> God hath
given the meanest of them a sense of
good and evil in divers instances,
and that he is willing to assist them
with his grace to live accordingly;
as also that he sometimes excites
their Wills, who dares deny? Hath
not S. <hi>Paul</hi> told us, that they are
<hi>without excuse,</hi> or <hi>rendered inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable?</hi>
but how can they be so, if
they are denyed what is, at least, so
far necessary as was now said? But,
<hi>Philalethes,</hi> we need not trouble
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50061:139"/>
our selvs about them; we shall, no
question, at the great day (if we can
but have patience to wait till then)
clearly understand the infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God Almighty's proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with them; and that those of
them, that shall then have the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of condemnation past upon
them, will accuse themselvs mostly,
and not at all their Maker for it.
For my part, I will not say that they
are any of them saved; but I would
not for a world, neither, pronounce
them all damned. I know that
<hi>there is no name under heaven
whereby men can be saved, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the name of Iesus Christ;</hi> but I
am nowhere told, that those which
never heard of him cannot be saved
by him, without faith in him. If
this be so, what becomes of poor
Infants? nay, of all those, except
a Prophet or two, that lived before
the coming of our Saviour? He
shall be my great <hi>Apollo,</hi> that can
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50061:140"/>
give me sufficient reason to believe
that any under the Law, except
some few extraordinary persons, had
faith in Christs death for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their sins; whenas his own
Disciples had not, till after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
but yet eleven of them
will be acknowledged to have been
good men before his death. Nay,
it is evident, that till after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
they retained too gross a
notion of the Messiah. So that, I
say, if any of the Heathens be saved
(which if they are not, it will be
their own faults) it may be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to understand their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Christ for it, when they are
come into the other world. But
why should we <hi>Christians</hi> be less
charitable toward them, than were
the very Jews? who admitted those
that observed the seven Precepts of
<hi>Noab,</hi> and worshipt the true God,
(who were called <hi>Proselytes of the
gate</hi>) to the hope of eternal life.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50061:140"/>
And the saying of <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew
to <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> is very observable.
<hi>If thou hadst continued a Heathen
Philosopher,</hi> said he, <hi>and lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamably,
there would have been
hope of thee: but seeing thou leavest
God, to believe in a Man, what hope
can there be of thy salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if I were bound to give my
sense of the honestest of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
I would chuse to judge on the
right hand: but we have nothing to
do with them; nor can any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
drawn from the consideration
of their circumstances, establish the
doctrine against which we have so
freely expressed our selvs.</p>

that those who have been in the

<hi>this,</hi> me-thinks, should be by all

And that he may have most wise ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that seem most harsh to us;
which we cannot so much as dream

reasons of all his actings; or level his

may well be abundantly satisfied
with this, That God is perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

what the Almighty hath declared
concerning himself in the plainest
manner that words can express, from
the attempts of those, that I think in

insignificant, and to vindicate him
from those notions that most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
tend to eclipse those perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

               <p>We most heartily abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
that consequence; nor can

may sin away their day of grace,

Gods holy Spirit, and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his blessed motions, they may
cause him quite to leave them, and
give them over to the hardness of
their own hearts. And let me speak
to the man, that is hereby inclined
to be more secure, in the words of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50061:142"/>
the excellent person, a passage in
whose Sermon I before quoted, and
which presently follow it. <hi>Thou
wretched Fool! darest thou make
an advantage of Gods goodness to
assist and patronize thy security?
Hath he promised to give thee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
whensoever thou pleasest
to allow thy self leisure to seek it?
No, know, there is a time, (and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming

whom I hope are good people would
be better, I verily think, were it not
for that doctrine: But I am certain
that multitudes of wicked wretches
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50061:143"/>
are greatly hardened in their sins by
it; and will not endure to be told
that it is not true, that they may not
be deprived of the main prop of
their security. They will fleer in the
faces of their pious Ministers, when
they pathetically excite them to
work out their own salvation; and
flatter themselvs with this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere
the Preacher is pleased to say,
there is no necessity of any such
strictness and diligence, or of any at
all: for their fate is determined; and
that though holiness be necessary to
happiness, yet if they are absolutely
designed for happiness, God will
sure enough, at one time or other
make them holy; but if not, let them
do what they can, he will not. And
who can answer this? Were there
no other mischief attending the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

conclude it false. And would it not
vex one to the very soul, to be liable
to be baffled by every sorry Rascal;

I wish that no much slighter
occasions could ever make me so,
and then of all my sins, I should least
bewail that of Passion. Well, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalethes,</hi>
I am sure that our doctrine
is a mighty incentive to holiness, and
the other a no less obstacle; as many
as there are whose true goodness
doth antidote them against the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it. And this is the great Test
and Standard, whereby I examine
points of Controversie; I consider
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50061:144"/>
which of the opposites tends most
to the advancement of real holiness,

                  </note> in that
by their killing the Messiah, and
most obstinate persisting in unbelief,
they had provoked God to resolve
upon the casting off and rejecting
their Nation in general, that is, to
put them into the same circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with the rest of the world, and
in some respects into worse, <hi>viz</hi> to

deprive them of their good land,
and even to cause them to cease to
be a Nation or Body Politick, but to
be dispersed here and there up and

deprived of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

had an enjoyment of, which are

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50061:146"/>
that are of Israel;</hi> i. e. God hath
reserved to himself a liberty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
at several times, according
to his pleasure, who shall be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom
the promise belongeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may restrain it to those that
were never the seed of his loyns, but
of his faith onely. And he sheweth
next that this liberty God did use
immediately after the promise: for,
saith he in</p>
               <p>V. 7. <hi>Neither because they are the
seed of Abraham are they all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but in Isaac shall thy seed be
called:</hi> i. e. Those which came from
<hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns were not <hi>all</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
those sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> that
should have a share in the promise,
but <hi>those</hi> onely which he should
have by <hi>Isaac.</hi> And he saith in</p>
               <p>V. 8. <hi>That is, they which are the
children of the</hi> flesh, <hi>these are not the
children of God, but the children of
the</hi> promise <hi>are accounted for the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50061:147"/>
seed.</hi> i. e. They that descended from
<hi>Abraham</hi> by carnal generation were
not all heirs of the promised Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
but onely those children he
had by vertue of the promise were
accounted for the seed that should
so be. Then it followeth,</p>
               <p>V. 9. <hi>For this is the word of
promise, At this time will I come,
and Sarah shall have a son.</hi> i. e. The
birth of <hi>Isaac</hi> was a special effect of
Gods promise; he being miraculously
born of a naturally-barren woman,
and according to the ordinary course
of nature past childbearing, had she
been never so fruitful; and his father
being a very old man. Then saith he,</p>
               <p>V. 10, 11, 12. <hi>And not onely this,
but when Rebecca also had conceived
by one, even by our father Isaac (for
the children being yet unborn, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done good or evil, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God according to election
might stand not of works, but of him
that calleth) it was said unto her,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50061:147"/>
The elder shall serve the younger.</hi> i. e.
Neither did God at one time onely
declare, that he reserved to himself
liberty to distinguish between the
sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the promised inheritance,
and other extraordinary priviledges;
but he declared it again concerning
the sons of <hi>Isaac:</hi> For before the
birth of the Twins which he had by
<hi>Rebecca,</hi> and therefore when neither
had done good or evil, whereby
there should be any difference made
between them, it was reveled by
God to her, that her elder son, that
is, the people that should be born of
him, should serve the younger, or
the Nations that should descend
from him. This I say, because <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi>
in his own person did never
serve <hi>Iacob.</hi> And this appeareth
farther, in that God told <hi>Rebecca</hi> at
the same time, that <hi>two</hi> NATIONS
<hi>were in her womb.</hi> So that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that he intended
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50061:148"/>
to restrain the promise made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
to the seed of <hi>Iacob</hi> onely;
and that they alone were chosen by
him to inherit the good land, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with its appendages. And this
priviledge, he tells them here, they
had not upon the account of any
foreseen desert of theirs, but onely
of <hi>his</hi> free goodness that <hi>called</hi> or
<hi>designed</hi> them thereunto. Then
he thus proceedeth,</p>
               <p>V. 13. <hi>As it is written, Iacob
have I loved, and Esau have I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
This is a quotation out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi>
1, 2, 3. where <hi>Esau</hi>'s person
was not spoken of; but by <hi>Esau,</hi> his
posterity the <hi>Edomites</hi> are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
as you will see, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the place. Some conceive, that
whereas God saith by the Prophet
that he hated <hi>Esau</hi> or the <hi>Edomites,</hi>
he meant no more than that he less
loved them than the <hi>Israelites,</hi> or
was not so kinde to <hi>them,</hi> as he was
to <hi>these;</hi> in that whereas he gave
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50061:148"/>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> or the <hi>Israelites</hi> a land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with milk and honey, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Esau</hi> or the <hi>Edomites</hi> was
the stony and barren mountains of
<hi>Seir.</hi> And it is certain that so the
word that signifieth <hi>to hate</hi> is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places to be understood. As <hi>Gen.
29. 31. Iacob</hi> is said to <hi>hate Leah;</hi> i. e.
he loved <hi>Rachel</hi> better, as appeareth
by the foregoing verse. In <hi>Luke</hi>
14. 26. we are required to <hi>hate our
father and mother,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Iohn</hi>
12. 25. to <hi>hate our lives.</hi> But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
understands by <hi>hating</hi> these,
any more than not loving them so
well as Christ. But however, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that by <hi>hating</hi> in this chapter
of <hi>Malachi,</hi> is to be understood very
severely punishing: and indeed, the
words following make this evident.
And observe that the Apostle doth
here onely allude to these words of
the Prophet: nor doth he say, that
<hi>before the children had done either
good or evil,</hi> God said, <hi>Iacob have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50061:149"/>
I loved, and Esau have I hated;</hi> but
onely, <hi>The elder shall serve the
younger.</hi> But as for that saying, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau
have I hated,</hi> it was after their
wicked and most unnatural behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
towards their brethren the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
and also upon the account;
as you will see, if you compare this
place with the Prophecie of <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah;</hi>
where, in vers. 10. it is said,
<hi>For thy violence against thy brother
Iacob shame shall cover thee, and
thou shalt be cut off for ever:</hi> And
in the next verses, we see what the
violence they are charged with was.
I confess I do not know but that I
am singular in this Exposition; but
it is so very evident, that I should
wonder if several Expositors should
not have hit upon it. Now then
the Apostle saith,</p>
               <p>V. 14. <hi>Is there unrighteousness
with God? God forbid.</hi> i. e. Will
God be unjust in casting off the
seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:50061:149"/>
which strictly observe the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by <hi>Moses,</hi> and making
those of the Gentiles his special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
in their stead, that believe
his Revelation made by Christ and
his Apostles? No surely, we cannot
accuse him of injustice if he doth so;
for it is but agreeable to his own
words to <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. 15. <hi>For he saith to Moses, I
will have mercy on whom I will
have mercy, and I will have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on whom I will have compassion.</hi>
i. e. I will bestow my kindness
where I please, without giving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof to any one. And
therefore God may justly accept
Gentiles to his special favour, as ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
and wicked as generally they
are, (for he is not obliged to damn
all that deserve it) and cast off his
ancient people the Jews at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as strict observers as they are
of one Law, they being disobedient
to another. Then he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:50061:150"/>
V. 16. <hi>So then it is not of him
that willeth, or of him that runneth,
but of God that sheweth mercy.</hi> i. e.
From thence it is evident, that this
mercy and favour of God is not the
desert or prerogative of those that
with great zeal aspire to it, but in a
wrong way, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
performances; as the Jews do,
(this you will see is very clear by
v. 31, 32.) but to be had from the
free grace and mercy of God by
faith in Jesus Christ. Then in the
verse following the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to shew that God had reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
liberty to himself, not onely in
bestowing benefits on whom, and on
what conditions he pleaseth; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in inflicting punishments, and so
casting off the Jews, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their zeal for the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi>
for this he tells them God had given
them a plain testimony, concerning
his dealing in the like case, <hi>viz.</hi>
shewing his severity against obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50061:150"/>
sinners, as the Jews were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
Christ and his blessed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
And instanceth in that of
<hi>Pharaoh;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. 17. <hi>For the Scripture saith
unto Pharaoh, For this same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
have I raised thee up, that I
might shew my power in thee, and
that my Name might be declared
throughout all the earth.</hi> i. e. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
having long hardened his own
heart, notwithstanding the several
warnings he had by <hi>Moses,</hi> and no
fewer than six Judgements inflicted
upon him; God at length saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him, that he would harden
his heart in his just judgement, <hi>i. e.</hi>
do that which he would be farther
hardened by: and addes, that he
would presently cut him off, but
that he preserved him, and raised
him out of great dangers, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, but to make him an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his just indignation against
obdurate and stubborn Rebels, in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50061:151"/>
the more signal and illustrious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which
is translated [<hi>I have raised thee up</hi>]
is to be understood as was now said,
is apparent, in that it signifieth to
raise out of some low condition, and
often from some disease or danger,
as a very learned Critick hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Particularly, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 15. it
is used to signifie raising out of a
disease. And farther, this appears
from the Hebrew word that is used
<hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 16. which is the very place
that is here cited by the Apostle: the
word there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<hi>Stare feci, I have made thee
stand.</hi> The Vulgar Latine renders
it, <hi>Sustentavite, I have sustained
thee.</hi> The Septuagint, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Thou
wert kept,</hi> or <hi>kept alive.</hi> It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</p>
               <p>V. 18. <hi>Therefore hath he mercy
on whom he will have mercy, and
whom he will be hardeneth.</hi> i. e.
From hence I conclude, that God
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50061:151"/>
may without the least injustice, have
mercy at his pleasure, on some wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
persons that have deserved the
contrary; and harden others.</p>
               <p>By Gods hardening in Scripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXI.</hi> How God is said to harden sinners.</note>
we are not to understand any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
action of his, whereby he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
wickedness into men, or intends
and increaseth that which is already
in them; for then would he be the
author of sin; which to assert is the
highest blasphemy. Neither have
we any cause to believe that it is to
be understood of Gods withdrawing
all manner of necessary helps where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
sinners may be mollified. For
the Signes that were wrought upon
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> were in themselvs very
proper to soften him; and most of
them, while they continued, had that
effect: but Gods still removing of
them, seems to be the great cause of
his induration; as among others is
observed by <hi>Origen.</hi> And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
he saith, that it is usual for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50061:152"/>
to speak after this manner to
their disobedient children: <hi>'Tis I
have hardened you, 'tis I that have
made a Rogue of you: for had not I
been so indulgent towards you, you
would not behave your self as you do
towards me.</hi> So that by Gods hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we are to understand no more
than his doing such things to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, which are not in their own
nature, but accidentally, through
their wickedness, the occasion of
their farther hardening. And so,
and no otherwise, did he harden the
Jews; nay, <hi>chiefly</hi> were they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
by the divine <hi>forbearance</hi> to
punish them for their rebellion and
unbelief; by which means most of
them came to be, through their own
naughtiness, more and more obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
and so rendred themselvs the
more fit objects of that vengeance
that forty years after our Saviours
death, according to his prediction,
brake forth upon them. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50061:152"/>
this induration, each
particular person of them was not in
an absolutely hopeless condition as
to their eternal state, appeareth in
that many of them were converted
to the faith by the Apostles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
though it is certain, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of them, considered as a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
was inevitable; and the decree
concerning their being deprived of
those priviledges, whereby they
were for a long time distinguished
from other people, irreversible.
In the next words a reply of the
perverse Jews is brought in, to
what the Apostle had said to them
in those foregoing; which, 'tis like,
they had sometime made upon the
like occasion.</p>
               <p>V. 19. <hi>Thou wilt say then unto
me, Why doth he yet finde fault? for
who hath resisted his will?</hi> i. e. Why
doth he still accuse us for, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
us with not believing in your
Jesus; when he hath (as it seemeth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50061:153"/>
from what thou hast said) hardened
us, and is resolved to reject us? for
his counsel shall stand; who hath
ever resisted his decree? though we
should now believe the Gospel, it
will be to no purpose. Nay, now
he would not have us believe it, that
his decree concerning us may take
effect. To this he answers,</p>
               <p>V. 20. <hi>Nay but, O man, who art
thou that repliest against God? shall
the thing formed say unto him that
formed it, Why hast thou made me
thus?</hi> i. e. Nay but, O man, who
art thou, that thou darest tax the
wisdom of God, upon the account
of his so doing, as if he could do
foolishly? (And as for his dealing
in such a manner with you, as that
you become by that means more
hardned, and averse to obey his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
you may thank your selvs for
it, and therefore have no cause to
object against Gods <hi>justice</hi> neither:
and besides, 'tis onely long of your
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50061:153"/>
own wickedness that you become
more hardned by any of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences).
For you therefore to talk
after this rate, is as arrogant, as if
the thing formed should say to him
that formed it, why hast thou made
me after this fashion?</p>
               <p>V. 21. <hi>Hath not the potter power
over the clay, of the same lump to
make one vessel to honour, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to dishonour?</hi> i. e. If you
think that God hath dealt unjustly
with you, I pray answer me this
Question: Hath not the Potter
power over his clay, to make of it
what vessel he thinks good? And
when a piece thereof is marred upon
the wheel, to make a meaner vessel
of it than otherwise it might have
been? and shall not your Creator
have as much power to deal with
you as he pleaseth, and (if he thinks
good) to harden some of you, when
he converts others; seeing you have
rendered your selvs as liable to his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50061:154"/>
wrath, as is the clay to the Potters
pleasure? By <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 18. 4, 5, 6,
and the following verses, will this
Exposition be made very plain and
clear: to which place the Apostle,
in these words, doth very probably
allude; and you will by those verses
understand, that the onely use God
himself makes of this similitude, is
the very same with that which you
now heard. Then he goes on
thus:</p>
               <p>V. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23 <hi>What if God, willing
to shew his wrath, and to make his
power known, endured</hi> (or <hi>will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;</hi>
here being, 'tis like, an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of the Tense) <hi>with much long-suffering
the vessels of wrath fitted
to destruction; and that he might</hi> (or
<hi>that it may please him to) make
known the riches of his glory, on the
vessels of mercy which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prepared unto glory?</hi> i. e. What
if God doth not presently punish
you according to your desert, but
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50061:154"/>
goeth on for some time to bear with
you, and, while he doth so, findes
fault with you for your unbelief?
What if he doth not immediately
destroy those that have long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him to it, and by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Rebellions made themselves
most worthy and fit objects of his
wrath; but is pleased still, with
great gentleness and patience, to
bear with them (as he did with
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>) to chide and threaten
them (as he also did him) that
so he may the more severely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against those, that shall be
more hardned by his forbearance,
and continue refractory notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his threats, and punish
them in the more exemplary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
(as he did that wicked King)
I pray what shew of injustice is
in this? But much less can God
be taxed with unrighteousness in
having mercy on some as ill-deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jews, and even wicked Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50061:155"/>
(see the next verse) by prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them by a true and effectual
faith in Christ for eternal blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to demonstrate, in the most
signal manner, the riches of his grace
and goodness.</p>
               <p>Observe, that <hi>the vessels of wrath
fitted to destruction,</hi> are such as the
Apostle saith God <hi>endured with
much long-suffering;</hi> and therefore
they were not made so by any abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Decree of his, but made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
so by their wilful and free sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
For what <hi>long-suffering</hi> can
it be, to bear with the sins of those
that could never have possibly been
avoided?</p>

for who hath disobeyed his

&amp;c. i. e. You may be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of that sawcie and profane an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
for may not God your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
impose what Laws he pleaseth
on you? is he bound never to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Law given by <hi>Moses</hi> to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50061:156"/>
you, and to require your obedience
to no other? And then it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Hath not the potter power over
the clay?</hi> &amp;c. And therefore why
may not God, for your obstinate
disobedience to his Son Jesus, as
zealous as you are for the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> of a glorious Nation digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with extraordinary priviledges,
make a base and contemptible peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of you; and continuing in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
make your condition far
worse too in the other world; as
well as the Potter, when he findes a
piece of clay untractable, so that it
will not be made a fine vessel, doth
make a courser, and one for a mean
use, of it?</p>

               <p>This Exposition of yours
is ingenious, and for ought I know
the truest; if either there can be
found a good connexion between
the 22 verse, and those so interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
or the 22 verse be related not
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50061:157"/>
so much to these, as to the 18

               <p>But whatsoever mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostle had in some verses
of this Chapter, the oftener I read
it, the more am I convinced, that
there is not a syllable of any such
Doctrine as that you have been
disproving to be found there: and
that he saith nothing to prove ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Esau</hi> or his posterity to be
put into a desperate condition, by
Gods decrees, concerning their
eternal state; but onely that the
seed of <hi>Iacob</hi> were distinguished
from that of <hi>Esau</hi> by the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of far greater priviledges in
this world. Nor that he asserts
any other Reprobation of the Jews,
than that which their wilful reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Messiah, and his Gospel,
was the cause of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No, nor yet, as I said,
doth the Apostle say, that they
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50061:157"/>
were in a hopeless condition as to
their eternal salvation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their unbelief; but onely
that upon this account God had
passed an irreversible Decree for
the rejection of them considered
as a <hi>Nation.</hi> For the <hi>conversion</hi>
of any particular persons among
them, is not asserted to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impossible; but all that may
be proved from any of his words
is, that Gods purpose to cast them
off so far as that they should be no
more a distinct <hi>Nation</hi> or Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
was unchangeable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>I have been often told
that the most ancient Fathers were
not so Eagle-eyed as to espie that
doctrine either in this Chapter, nor
yet elsewhere.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Several, nay <hi>most</hi> of
them, most plainly, I assure you,
contradict it in their Writings in
the plainest expressions; as I am
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50061:158"/>
prepared to shew you at large,
whensoever you shall please to
desire me.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXIII.</hi> That the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to absolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with its conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants.</note> And this is so true,
that you know they are suspected
by many of that Doctrine which
was since their days called <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianism,</hi>
though without suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground; if at least the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Doctrine were what it is now
commonly represented to be; but
it is not certainly known what it
was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>This alone is <hi>almost</hi> a
<hi>demonstration</hi> to me, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
never preacht this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
For those Fathers living
so near their days, 'tis not easily
conceivable how they should so
unanimously concur in mistaking
their sence, <hi>they</hi> being in far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
circumstances to understand it,
than <hi>we</hi> that are at such a distance
from them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:50061:158"/>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>But how is it imaginable
then, that they should run so soon
from one Extreme to another, as
they must have done, if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
suspicion of some be
true. But however, I can by no
means understand how it should
come to pass, that those Fathers of
the Church that almost immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
succeeded the Apostles, should in
such a point as this, (which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be so clearly revealed) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from them. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> wrote
his Apology for the Christians but
fifty years after St <hi>Iohn</hi>'s death, as
appeareth by the Apology it self;
I mean that written to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
Senate, and People of <hi>Rome;</hi>
for therein he tells them, that it is
now one hundred and fifty years
since Christ's Nativity; and St <hi>Iohn</hi>
died according to both <hi>Eusebius</hi> and
St <hi>Hierom</hi> sixty eight years after his
Passion; and therefore a 1000 or
101 after his Birth. Now <hi>Iustin</hi> in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50061:159"/>
several of his undoubted Books ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
contradicteth that Doctrine;
and so he doth particularly in his
First Apology, <hi>viz.</hi> that to <hi>Antoninus
Pius;</hi> which the forementioned <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
and St <hi>Hierom</hi> say was the first,
though it be set in the second place.
The like also doth <hi>Athenag<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ras</hi> who
was <hi>Iustin</hi>'s Equal; and <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
frequently, who was Scholar to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarpus,</hi>
who was Scholar to St <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Evangelist. And I can give you
many more instances, as <hi>Tatianus,
Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,
&amp;c.</hi> but that this is a most plain
and confessed case.</p>

               <p>This Doctrine, as it hath

               <p>They were (as I can

largely shew you) the most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
<hi>Hereticks</hi> that ever the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church was infested with,
from its first Plantation to this very
day; as many other vile ones as
there have been: And they were as
horribly prophane <hi>Devils</hi> also, as
ever the Earth bore: And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Men's being under an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
Fate of being wicked and
miserable, or good and happy, was
their great Encouragement so to be,
as appeareth by their being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for the propagation of it.
Nor were they so meal-mouthed
as to stick at declaring the too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
sequel from it that all good
men abominate, <hi>viz. That God is the
Author of sin:</hi> As also that other
which all such must abominate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,

Vertue and Vice are made so by

things, and nothing in themselves.
Well, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> it is high time to
have done with this, we are gotten
into a large field, and scarcely know
how to get out of it. The truth is,
I did not think, when we entered
on this Discourse, to be held in it
one quarter of this time; but one
word hath insensibly drawn on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and indeed we may as
easily persist in it twice thus long.
Let us therefore bethink our selves,
and proceed to what remaineth.</p>

               <p>I shall only desire first to
mind you of a passage I have read
in the Life of the most Judicious
and Pious Mr <hi>Ioseph Mede,</hi> written
by the Learned Dr <hi>Worthington,</hi> and
affixed to his Elaborate Works;
which is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXV.</hi> Mr <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph Mede</hi> his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Point.</note> 
                  <hi>If at at any time</hi> (as
it was said of St <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens) his
Spirit was stirred in him, it was when he
observed some to contend with an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
confidence, and bitter zeal, for
the Black Doctrine of Absolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50061:161"/>
upon which occasion he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to tell some of his Friends, that it
was an Opinion he could never digest;
being herein much of Dr</hi> Jacksons <hi>mind,
that generally the Propugners of such
Tenets were men resolved in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Love and Hatred, both of
which they exercised constantly, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
and according to their own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
made a judgment of God and his
Decrees.</hi> Several more passages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the same matter, you may
(if you have not already) <hi>there</hi> also
read; which shew his judgment in
this particular; as much a <hi>Calvinist</hi>
as he was accounted.</p>

us, in Her 17 Article, To receive

to those Sons of Hers, that were
the occasion of all this Talk. And
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50061:161"/>
take notice, that as in <hi>this</hi> last, so in
divers other of those Points, about
which there hath been so great a
Contest, and which have raised such
Feuds and Animosities betwixt
Protestants, their moderation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable.<note place="margin">

(as hath been too general a practice)
Endeavoured to run as far from
their Adversaries as possibly they
could; but carefully observing
what truth may be found in their
Opinions, and heedfully separating
it from what they conceive Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
in them, they have, I say in
some more, which with too great
heat have been Controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, steered a middle Course;
which time will not admit me now
to inlarge upon, and therefore I
will not so much as instance in
them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore it is no great
wonder, that it fares with them, as
usually it doth with those that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

to part a fray, that they are

                     <hi>XXXVIII.</hi> None more disliked by them than the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers of Truth to a Party.</note> there are none they
can worse brook, than the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers
of Truth to a Party, or
those that make the judgments of
such, as they most admire, the

but God himself: They not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wisest and best of men, or

a possibility of being deceived.
They therefore look upon it as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to knock down their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
with humane Authorities,
and to deprive each other of their

               <p>And upon the same

blame those, whose practice is

it is more than she knows or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves

               <p>Very good; But where
shall we look for her Decrees?
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50061:163"/>
If it be said in the Writings of
the Apostles; we will cry up the
Churches infallibility, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
as she believeth as much
as any. But then, who shall
judge of the true sense of those
Writings, in matters dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Will they say, That

But we are like to be but sorrily

               <p>But there are few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
Points determined by
them; what then shall we do as
to all other? But besides, what
assurance have we that those
Councils ascribed Infallibility to
themselves? But suppose they
did, must we believe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
upon their own bare
word? If any will assert so, they
must prove it, except we are
bound to believe them as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as those Councils; and if
they undertake to prove this, who
shall judge whether they do it
well or no? They must say e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man's own reason, or hold
their peace; and if so, then all is
at last to be thereinto resolved.
Nor is it any mens saying that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50061:164"/>
General Councils are infallible,
that will cause considerative
men one jot the sooner to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
their Decrees, unless their
understandings be first convinced
by a proof of it. If any will say,
that those Councils proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or shall for them go about
to prove that they were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the same Question recurrs,
who shall judge whether this be
done convincingly? And so the
matter comes again to the same
Issue.</p>

               <p>I am so far from it, that
I have a great Veneration both
for the Ancient Fathers, and all
General Councils that have been
impartially Called; and whose
members have been under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
but were freely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to speak their minds, and give
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50061:165"/>
their Suffrages; but I must tell
you, that such have been at <hi>most</hi>
very <hi>rarely</hi> known. Yet I will
not ascribe more to such neither,
than I have good reason for;
much less will I believe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
against plain reasons, too
many to be now given. If I
could think any so, I should be
most inclined to believe it, of the
Great Jewish Sanhedrin, because
the Jews were expresly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to stand to their Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
but he that will say
<hi>that</hi> Council could not err, must
renounce his Christianity, and
believe that it justly Condemn'd
our Saviour.</p>

               <p>I say,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLII.</hi> What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is due to Councils.</note> that we ought
rather to suspect our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Judgments, than without ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apparent reason to conclude
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50061:165"/>
their Determinations false. And
moreover, that it is our duty in
order to the preserving of the
Churches peace, not publickly
to oppose them, whatsoever opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we have of them. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them obnoxious to errour,
yet I will grant them to have the
Authority of Courts of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
and that their Power is so
great as to bind men to outward
submission, when their errours
are not so weighty as to prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
the Churches peace. But
though we ought for peace-sake
to submit to them, in all things
that are not contrary to the great
Essentials of our Faith; yet (as
I said) there is no warrant for
our being obliged to assent to
their Decrees (<hi>quatenus</hi> so) as
infallibly true. But for all this
saying, neither I, nor those friends
of ours (who are all, I believe,
of the same Judgment in this
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50061:166"/>
point) do no less value all General
Councils then doth our Mother the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as appears by
what she saith of them in her 21 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
whose words are these;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLIII.</hi> The Church of <hi>England's</hi> sense of General Councils.</note> 
                  <hi>General
Councils may not be gathered together
without the Commandment and Will of
Princes. And when they be gathered
together, forasmuch as they be an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of men, whereof all be not governed
with the Spirit and Word of God, they
may erre, and sometime have erred, even
in things pertaining unto God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things ordained by them as necessary
to Salvation, have neither Strength nor
Authority, unless it may be declared that
they are taken out of Holy Scripture.</hi>
And it will not be amiss to mind
you also; that in her 19 Article
she declares not onely that the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but also that those
of <hi>Ierusalem, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi>
have actually erred. By these Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you will easily guess, who are
most of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50061:166"/>
Judgment in this Point; whether <hi>we</hi>
or <hi>those</hi> Persons, whose talk we but
now took notice of, and which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
this Discourse. And the like
to what was said of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
we also most heartily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
concerning our own particular
Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLIV.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our own Church not to be opposed in Matters disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That we are bound by
no means to oppose the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her Governours and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
in disputable Matters; nor do
they (as hath been shewn) require
our internal Assent to their Articles,
but enjoyn our submission to them,
as to an Instrument of Peace onely.
And what wise and good man can
think, though he should suppose
them (not only subject to error, but
likewise) to have actually erred in
some of them, that Contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them can by any means make
amends for the loss of the Churches
Peace?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is too apparent that those
which contend for an Infallible Judg
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50061:167"/>
of Controversies in Religion, are like
to do no service towards the ending
of them, but indeed so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service
as to encrease them. Seeing
there is nothing more hard to prove,
than that there is any such Judge;
and, if there be, where he is to be
found: And in the determining of
this Controversie, the Reason of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans own mind must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to, except there be another
Judge to resolve us concerning that
Judge; and again, another to satisfie
us concerning him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLV.</hi> An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended us no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Iudge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.</note> and so we shall
never have done. And I look upon
this as a most certain Argument, that
our Saviour never intended us any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
besides our own Reason, assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Blessing; for if he had,
he would, no doubt, have been so
plainly deciphered, as that there
should be no dispute about him;
much less would that which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for the Churches Peace, be an
unavoidable occasion of Contention.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I see no need
of any other Judge, for the Rule of
our Faith, the Scripture, is in all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Points so plain, that we can
not reasonably desire to have it plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
And moreover, in such Points,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLVI.</hi> Private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in the same sence that the Church Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative hath the promise of it.</note>
every private honest Christian hath a
promise of Infallibility in the same
sence, that the Church Representative
hath. <hi>If any man will do his Will,</hi> (saith
our Saviour) <hi>he shall know of the Doctrine
whether it be of God,</hi> John 7. 17. <hi>If ye
continue in my Words, then are ye my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
indeed; and ye shall know the Truth,</hi>
Joh. 8. 31, 32. &amp; several other promises
there are to the same purpose. I grant,
the Church cannot err in <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
while she continues so, for should
she, she would, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> cease so to
be; and therefore the same is to be
asserted also concerning every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Member of it. And as for <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials,</hi>
why may not men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
about them, and maintain peace
and love notwithstanding? What is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50061:168"/>
there in not thinking just alike in
doubtful Matters, that should make
people so much as angry with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLVII.</hi> Of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacity.</note>
I like not, I confess, a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious
wrangling and contradicting
Humour; I despise nothing more;
it argues those, in whom it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
to have attained to no solid
judgment or sense of things; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
there is a deal of conceitedness
and pride in it, and too much, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
of a cross-graind and ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLVIII.</hi> Of Friendly Disputes.</note>
But amicable Disputes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
meerly in order to the finding
out of Truth, can have no other than
a good effect: and moreover, they
add much to the pleasure of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLIX.</hi> The way to peace.</note>
And therefore let the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of Christianity labour for the true
spirit and temper of Christians; and
it will be as well with the Christian
World, as if we were all of the same
mind. I mean, let us not magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
impose upon one another, and
be so charitable as to believe well of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50061:168"/>
Dissenters from us that live good
lives, are of a modest and peaceable
deportment, and hold no Opinions,
that directly oppose the design of the
Christian Religion, and of making
men like to God; and then we shall
see, that there will be little reason to
desire an Infallible Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
to make us all of one Opinion.
So that by this pleading for one,<note place="margin">

Case standing as it doth) there is no
hope of having an end put to them,
but by this means (as you said well)
is there another Controversie added
to the rest; and this alone, except it
were more plainly decidable than it
is, may cause as much wrangling, as
the Church is now disturbed with.

                  <hi>Theophilus,</hi> you have
imparted to me, I thank you, very
excellent Principles. Without
doubt they would be greatly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to the cementing of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
differences, and healing our
lamentable wide Breaches, if they
were generally entertained by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and improved. What a
brave World should we have,
would we but all practise upon
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50061:173"/>
such Principles? This would be
the way to unite those in <hi>Affection,</hi>
that differ in <hi>Opinion.</hi>

               <p>And this would be the
way too, to make far fewer diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Opinion: For then would
not men be superstitiously fearful
of impartially examining those
Doctrines, the truth of which,
they now think it a sin so much as
to call in question. And by this
means, taking all those they have
been instructed in for granted,
there is little hope of ever unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them. These Principles,
being well digested, will likewise
mightily quiet mens minds, and
cure them of all tormenting
fears, of their being out of the
true way to Blessedness, while
they are not conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of living in the allowance
of any known sin, or neglect of
any such duty, that they seek
Truth impartially, and adopt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50061:173"/>
not any Opinion, in order to
the gratifying of any corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

Born to be Slaves; and think
bondage a great blessing: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how could they be so highly
displeased with the charity of those

<hi>Theophilus,</hi> that it might be upon this
account that so much Choler disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it self in a Reverend Doctor,
(whose <hi>years</hi> alone, it might be
thought, should have taught him
much more discretion) and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <p>There are those that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that 'twas envy chiefly that put
him upon taking so much vain pains

to render them odious to Gentlemen
too wise, to do other than pity him
for his labour; he finding himself
(as great as he thinks his own deserts)
less regarded, than some of those vile
persons. Moreover, <hi>Philalethes,</hi>
thence it is that some who have more
Zeal than Discretion, (and I wish I
had not cause to say more Passion
and Pride than either) do inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them as those, that are so far
from true Sons of the Church, that
they are her Enemies, and undermine
her; and more dangerous people
than the worst of Sects. And thence
it is that others too, who are of the
same temper, though of a contrary
Faction, joyn with these in accusing
them as men luke-warm in the Cause
of God, and unconcerned for the
Orthodox Religion; nay such as are
so far from contending earnestly for
the Faith once given to the Saints,
that they expose it, and endanger the
loss of it.</p>

               <p>I think in my Conscience,
they take the only course to preserve
it. But it seems those men take it
for granted, in the mean time, that
those Opinions they are pleased to
call theirs, must needs be of no less
account with God, than with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and that those they think
good to brand with the black mark

otherwise; and that there can be no

Learned Author of the Ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Britannick Church hath
shewn) as Fathers of Families were
at first both Princes and Priests, and
as by the encrease of Families, and
their enlargement into Cities and
Communities, the Oeconomick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
at length became Politick:
So it is apparant, that in the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Priesthood, <hi>Moses</hi> took
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50061:177"/>
away no part of the Supream Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from the Politick Authority;
for he, as King of <hi>Iesurun,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by God himself the Keeper, as
well of both Trumpets, as Tables.
And as <hi>Moses,</hi> not <hi>Aaron,</hi> delivered
the Ceremonial Law; so long after
<hi>Moses,</hi> King <hi>David,</hi> instituted the
Courses of Priests, and <hi>Solomon</hi> thrust
out <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High Priest. And
when Christ inaugurated his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
he furnisht them with great
powers of his own, such as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Sacraments, and the
power of the Keys; but all that he
bestowed on them, he did it Cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively,
and nought at all Privitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for he detracted nothing from
the Authority of the Civil Power;
nor gave any Commandment that
Kings, because Christians, should
have their Jurisdiction abated. But
you may find this Subject excellently,
and more fully handled, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

are of those good Subjects,
that heartily acknowledge the Kings
Majesty to be Supream Governour,
in these his Dominions, in all Causes,
as well Ecclesiastical as Civil; they
must needs likewise believe, that the
Church Government He hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
may not without the guilt
of Rebellion be violently opposed, or
of Sedition, be in any kind affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by any of his Subjects.</p>

that are not next door to Mad-men.
And these our Friends acknowledge
also, that it is in the power of the
Governours of the Church to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Forms of Prayer to be used in
Publick; and such Rites as they in
their Wisdom shall conceive most
proper for the decent, orderly and
Reverend Solemnizing of Divine
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50061:178"/>
Worship: And that it is the duty of
all under their Authority to Submit
to the use of such Forms; supposing
the matter of them be agreeable to the
Holy Scriptures, and that they are
directed onely and immediately to
God in the Name of Christ; and
that they ought to conform to those
Rites, so long as they are of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
nature, and not imposed as
necessary in themselves, or essential
parts of Worship, or to recommend
the Worshippers to God, and make
their Service accepted, or to convey
Grace, or as laying an Antecedent
Bond upon the Judgment, as well as
on the Practice; but only as things
alterable, and in their own nature
indifferent: And such they conceive
the Forms of Prayer, now enjoyned,
to be; and the other Rites of our
Church; and to be no otherwise than
as such imposed.</p>

               <p>But do they not likewise

only to make choice of such Rites as
are in their own nature indifferent;
and to impose them as such, but also

               <p>That's certain: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these Divines, though they could

that a certain duty (and such is Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

Their great exactness in
little things; such as Tything Mint,

them before the weightier matters of
the Law, Judgement, Mercy and

And moreover his forbidding to

Wee'l therefore no longer exercise
each others patience, than while we
put up our most earnest Prayer, that
at length it may please the God of
Peace to guide all our Feet into the
way of Peace: That he would give
us teachable Tempers, modest and

minds; as to create such unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
heats among us, and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Animosities; to the great
dishonour of God; the no less
Scandal and Reproach of our most
Excellent Religion, the raising of
Jealousies in our Governours, the
Exposing our Church and State to
the Common Enemies, and the
greatly endangering our Immortal
Souls. That the Profession and
Practice of Christianity may not
so rarely go hand in hand: And
that we may place our Religion in
<hi>doing,</hi> rather than in <hi>talking</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputing:</hi>
And may behave our selves
as those that understand wherein
the Life and Power of Godliness
doth indeed consist. That [<hi>Non

ours, as it was the Ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Motto, and that the old Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Spirit may now at last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
among us. That we may not
peremptorily pursue our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50061:188"/>
Humours, and the Concerns
of Parties, and prefer them before
indifferent and impartial Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
after Truth; or oppose them
to the publick Peace, Reason and
Interest. That we may hate a sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish,
private Spirit, as unworthy of
the benignity, and generosity of
the Christian Religion. And
lastly, that we may contend with
each other about nothing more,
than who shall express, in the midst
of our different Perswasions, most
Charity and most Candour. <hi>God
grant that our</hi> Jerusalem <hi>may at length
