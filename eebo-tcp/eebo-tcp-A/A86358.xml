            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hence it is in Scripture frequently compared to the moſt loathſome things. Sinners are <hi>Vipers, Swine, Dogges,</hi> yea, <hi>bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 7. Matth. 7. 6. Iſa. 1. 6. Eze. 24. 11, 12 Hebr: 6. 8. 2 Tim. 2. 17: 1 King 8. 38.</note> 
               <hi>thornes, &amp;c.</hi> Sinne is <hi>Droſſe, ſcumme, rottenneſſe,</hi> and the worſt of diſeaſes, <hi>Leproſie, Plague, &amp;c.</hi> all which doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a ſeparation. It defiles the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. It defiles the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>conſcience, Tit.</hi> 1. 15. It puts mudde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>ſpring</hi> of all your actions, which will make the <hi>ſtreames</hi> very foule. It defiles our beſt <hi>duties, Prov.</hi> 15. 8. and it defiles our <hi>ſociety,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. Whereas, the more you ſeparate from

ſinne unto God, the more the ſoule is conformed to the pure <hi>law</hi> of God, which is both our <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> and the more it will bee <hi>transformed</hi> into Chriſt, which is our <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is no poſſibility of <hi>reconciling Chriſt and ſin,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3 No reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with Chriſt, but by ſeparation from ſin.</note> therefore the Saints have great reaſon to <hi>fall out</hi> with ſinne, that ſo they may bee in ſome capacity of <hi>falling in</hi> with Chriſt. They can expect no <hi>communion with him,</hi> unleſſe there bee a <hi>ſeparation from ſinne.</hi> When once they have <hi>waſhed</hi> and made themſelves <hi>clean, put away the evill of their doings from before Gods eyes, ceaſed to do evill, Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. then they are invited to a ſweet <hi>familiarity</hi> with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Come now, let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Then, and not till then they ſhall have communion with him to <hi>ſoule-ſaving purpoſes.</hi> The ſame language <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and hee will draw nigh to you, cleanſe your hands you ſinners, and purifie your hearts you double minded.</hi> You cannot meet and injoy <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with God, but in <hi>paths</hi> of <hi>purity. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would not ingage himſelfe to ſup with any of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> till they had ſeparated from their luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmeneſſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. Here in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16. the Spirit of God makes choyce of five <hi>emphaticall words</hi> in the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and <note place="margin">

What <hi>fellowſhip?</hi> what <hi>communion?</hi> what <hi>concord?</hi> what <hi>part?</hi> what <hi>agreement</hi> have the Saints of God with uncleanneſſe. As if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid <hi>five times</hi> over, the Saints who are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them, muſt not, cannot <hi>reconcile themſelves,</hi> to any compliance with ſinne and ſinners, no more then reconcile <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Beliall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, unleſſe the Saints make a ſeparation from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe and fellowſhip with wicked men therein, as they <note place="margin">4 Inevitable danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with ſin and ſinners.</note>

               <q>If <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not ſeparated themſelves from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by the blood of the Paſchall Lambe, but had communicated with them in their Idolatry, they might have felt the ſword of the deſtroying Angell in their houſes, as well as the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
               </q> It did coſt them very deare afterwards, that they had ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with <hi>Achans</hi> offence, for his act they ſmarted, indeed becauſe <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>The children of Iſrael committed a treſpaſſe in the accurſed thing,</hi> they were not carefull to keepe themſelves

            <p>It was a ſeaſonable prayer of that man of God; <hi>Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mee from my other mens ſinnes;</hi> God knowes wee have <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall</hi> finnes enow ſtanding upon our ſcore to undoe our ſoules eternally; the greater reaſon have wee to renounce all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>other mens uncleanneſſe.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> calls upon the Saints in <hi>Epheſus, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11, <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, but reprove them rather;</hi> make them not your ſinnes, by <hi>command, counſell, conſent, connivence,</hi> nor any other way; but rather beare witneſſe againſt them, at leaſt by a checking <hi>ſilence,</hi> if not by a ſeaſonable <hi>ſpeech,</hi> by <hi>lookes,</hi> by <hi>geſtures,</hi> by ſome rebuking <hi>actions,</hi> if not by downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>reproofes;</hi> If you joyne <hi>hearts</hi> in ſinning againſt God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <note place="margin">Revel. 18. 4.</note> to goe <hi>hand in hand</hi> under puniſhments from him.</p>
