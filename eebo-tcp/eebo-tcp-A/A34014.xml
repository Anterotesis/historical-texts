         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

antipathies which I meet in others: I seem
constellated for all Countries, and could
live peaceably under any national Church,
though I would not joyn with any schism
which is made to colour over a rebellion,
while a monstrous zeal, player-like takes

            <p>Most Polemicks, while they have too
rashly charg'd the body of error, have

Antagonists Trophies of their rashnesse:
Though truth is a strong fort inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may become a traytor, and expose
it to the mercy of an enemy. Most men
are so drunk with dispute and inebriated
by their passions, that they cast at Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
heads all they can lay hold on, not
fearing a rebound, or what weapons they
administer to their own ruine: show the
weakness of their adversaries with so much
of their own, that they lend opportunities
to error: they permit the wild bore in
their Vineyards, would keep out the Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
and open a gap for the Foxes would
expell the Wild bore: they whose malice
nam'd the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> Antichrist, their
weaknesse opened a door to the Brownist,
to bring in their own orders as rivolets

and refractory, that quiet error to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

resignation of faith to a simple obedience;
to believe our own without enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

by all visible Hierarchies (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

is thundred against them, which
believe any Doctrine but theirs. It cannot
be fit to believe God inspir'd this Church
and no other, since mankind is come from
the same carnall Ancestors, and God the
common Father. Must we believe our
Priests call their Doctrine faith, or argue
controversies? if argue, how much time and
wealth must we expend? by learning lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
reading Authors, unravelling ages,
examining Fathers, conferring expositions,
and reconciling contradictions, travailing
over countries, pilgrims on earth, and
at last we may be strangers to heaven; come
as short of it, as life of examining all. To
embrace all opinions, is as impossible, as
to learn or number, since they are as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
as the sand, which hath an analogy
with their foundations. To reject all must
relish of a stranger impiety, when one

would be a folly to leave a Meridian light
to follow the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of every phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

ceremonies, rites, volumes tend to it, and
no Sacrament but finally resolves into it;
all essentialls of Religion close in our faith,

while the swimming Elephant
cramp'd with difficulties, drowns, or mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

is swallowed up in an Abysse. These indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
verities may not only prevent the
inroads of impiety and Atheism, usher in
repentance, and reduce men from aery
controversy to solid vertue; and dispose
to concord, since we agree in eternall causes,
why should we disagree in triviall? these
common truths being firmer bonds of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then any thing emergent out of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should dissolve in any, who uses not
Religion for a cloak, while profit is as the
body, for whose ease he changes it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
or as the thiefe, whose quotidian
