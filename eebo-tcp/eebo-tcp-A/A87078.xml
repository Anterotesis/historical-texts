            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of <hi>Henry Harbotle,</hi> on the behalf of himſelf and above 100 of the poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants within the Barony of <hi>Langley</hi> in the County of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners being Tenants of, and within the ſaid Barony, of right ought to hold, and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors time out of mind have held their reſpective Tenements in fee by Copy of Court-Roll of the ſaid Barony, as may appear, not onely by Records and their Copies in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be produced) but alſo by Survey taken 12. <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon the attainder of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> Lord of the ſaid Barony; upon whoſe attainder the ſaid Barony came to the Crown; under whom your Pettioners ſaid Anceſtors, quietly held and enjoyed their ſaid Eſtates, paying onely the rents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon their ſaid Copies. And were upon every Diſcent or Alienation by the Stewards of the ſaid Barony (who held by Patent from the Crown) admitted Tenants according to the Cuſtome of the ſaid Barony, until the 16 <hi>Iac.</hi> In which year one <hi>Iohn Murray</hi> Eſquire, one of the Bed-Chamber to King <hi>Iames</hi> (having before gotten the ſaid Barony ſetled upon Feoffees for his uſe, and knowing that by the Title of the Crown he could not deſtroy the Petitioners cuſtome of Copy-hold) exhibited his Bill of complaint before the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> in Chancery againſt your Petitioners ſaid Anceſtors, and therein moſt falſly declared, that he was at the time of the exhibiting his ſaid Bill, by vertue of a conveyance from the co-heirs of the ſaid Earl, ſeized of the ſaid Barony in his demeaſne as of Fee; and that the Tenants thereof were only Tenants at the Wills of the Lords of the ſaid Barony, and not by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of inheritance; upon which ſuggeſtions, and others as falſe (too long to be here inſerted) obtained a moſt unjuſt Decree againſt ſome of your Petitioners yet alive; and the Anceſtors of the reſt, for deſtroying their ſaid Copyhold of inheritance: And thereupon moſt barbarouſly and cruelly perſecuted your ſaid Petitioners and Anceſtors (by tying ſome of them neck and heels together, and throwing them naked into the ſnow, and impriſoning a great many in the Fleet here at <hi>London,</hi> and others in ſeveral priſons far remote from their friends or habitation, where they ſuffered moſt inhumane cruelties) untill ſome of them had ſubmitted to the loſs of their Cuſtomes, by accepting of Leaſes from him; which was no ſooner done, but he then waved the title of the coheirs; and deſires his Feoffees to ſurrender their right back to the Crown, which they did; and then within two months after their ſurrender he takes from King <hi>Iames</hi> an Eſtate in Feeſimple in his own name to him and his heirs for ever, making no further uſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pretended titles of the Coheirs; and afterwards diſpoſes of his title to Sir <hi>Edward Ratcliff</hi> Baronet (a man of the like cruelty; and whoſe Religion is ſuch, that he openly profeſſeth it is as lawfull to kill a Proteſtant as a Veal-Calf, or a Dog.) For whoſe Recuſancie and Delinquencie, his Eſtate was by Act of Parliament appointed to be ſold, and the ſaid Barony, being parcel of his Eſtate, was by the Truſtees in that behalf accordingly ſold to one <hi>George Hurd,</hi> a perſon intruſted by and for Sir <hi>Edward Ratcliff.</hi> Others there are of your Petitioners, who never ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſaid Decree; yet have enjoyed their Lands according to their ſaid ancient cuſtome paying onely their old Rents.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners for recovery of their juſt and ancient right made their claim within the time limited by the Act for ſale of the ſaid Lands, before the Committee for removing obſtructions; but in regard it did not appear unto them that the aforeſaid Decree was reverſed; they did conceave themſelves bound up thereby, and no way capable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of your Petitioners ſaid claim, and there upon diſmiſſed it.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners are ſo impoveriſhed by the late war, frequent plundring of the Moſs-troopers, and cruel exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Lords; that they are no way able to wage Law, or proſecute a Bill of review of the ſaid Decree, although admitted in <hi>forma pauperis:</hi> fourty of your Petitioners at leaſt, being not able to make up 5 ſhillings in ready mony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore your Petitioners moſt humbly beſeech your Honours, to take their ſad condition into your pious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in regard of their aforeſaid poverty, that they may receive from your Honors, who are the fountain of Iuſtice in this Commonwealth; ſuch Iuſtice as ſhall upon the examination of their caſe, appear to be agreeable with the ancient Laws of this Nation, and the equity of their cauſe.</hi>
