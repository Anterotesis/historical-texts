            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Neither is it my purpose to meddle with the controversie between M. <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Aldermanbury</hi>; I say, between M. <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury.</hi> For though M. <hi>Burton</hi> saith, That his quarrell is only with four men in <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> yet, if the Reader will lose so much time, as to look into his <hi>Narrative,</hi> he will finde that he cals upon all <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> to be ashamed and confounded for shutting him out of doors, as he phraseth it. But I will not make this quarrell mine. <hi>For as I was never thought worthy by M.</hi> Burton <hi>to be desired to give leave to his first admission; so also I was not at all made acquainted with his dismission, and therefore am not at all concerned in the businesse.</hi> And although I shall be willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, not only the <hi>doors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>door</hi> of my heart, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting M. <hi>Burton</hi> in a brotherly and Christian compliance; yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I shall for ever shut the <hi>door of my lips</hi> from speaking any more about t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is controversie. And the rather, because that whereas in the book to which he answers, there are these words, <hi>And that all men may be fully convinced of Aldermanburies love and good affection towards M.</hi> Burton, <hi>we doe here professe to all that read these lines, That if M.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>will be pleased to forbear preaching his Congregationall way amongst us, and preach such things, wherein both sides agree, we will re-admit him with all readinesse and cheerfulnesse, and will promise to endeavour upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to come and hear him; which offer, if M.</hi> Burton <hi>refuseth, let the worldjudge, whether M.</hi> Burton <hi>shuts himself, or be shut-out of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors of Aldermanbury.</hi> To this friendly invitement, he answers not a word; which makes me for ever despair of his brotherly corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with us in our Churches. And truly, if M. <hi>Burton</hi> will not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to take a Pastorall charge in our Congregations, but condemneth our Churches, as having <hi>inseparable corruptions in them</hi> (for so he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 13. and repeats it twice) <hi>I say inseparable, till the very frame of them be made new</hi>; wherein he sideth directly with the <hi>Brownis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be <hi>dissenting Brethren</hi> from him also) and <hi>refuseth to give us the right hand of fellowship,</hi> as it is, <hi>p.</hi> 13. and saith, <hi>That people cannot with a safe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence communicate with us,</hi> as it is, <hi>p.</hi> 23. nor <hi>acknowledge our Ministers to be their Pastours truly,</hi> as it is, <hi>p.</hi> 23. and will not forbear to preach those dangerous errours in our Churches, no wonder that any conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Presbyterian</hi> should be shie of admitting him to preach to their people.</p>

And besides; this <hi>Truth is now grown stale and threed-bare,</hi> especially to this <hi>new-truth-itching</hi> age, and by this last book is so <hi>drowned in Gall and Wormwood,</hi> as that it may well lose: it's name, and be called <hi>Gall and Wormwood,</hi> as that <hi>star</hi> is, which <hi>fell from Heaven, Revel.</hi> 8.11. and as <hi>cloathes</hi> when died receive the name of those colours into which they were died.

And besides, I am twice challenged by name to answer him, and thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole book he speaks very undervaluingly of the Reformation begun in our Churches, and laieth <hi>stumbling blocks</hi> in our peoples way, which necessity cals to remove. All which I shall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in few words endeavour to do.</p>
            <p>To begin first with his <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> of my life. I read of a <hi>Painter,</hi> that being to paint King <hi>Antigonus</hi> that wanted an eye, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93169:3"/>
that side of his face only that had an eye, that so his <hi>deformity</hi> might not appear. But M. <hi>Burton</hi> quite contrary labours to set me out in all my <hi>deformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 5. He saith, <hi>I have not under pretence of enjoying my Ministery, abased my self to the superstitious innovations of the Prelates, and thereby caused many both Ministers and people thorow my example to fall into the same snare. Let the guilty apply it. And let some of Aldermanbury remember Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsbury, I say no more, verbum sapienti.</hi> Here M. <hi>Burton</hi> sets out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all his <hi>embroidery,</hi> that so my <hi>picture</hi> might be the more <hi>ugly.</hi> But M. <hi>Burton</hi> may remember that there was a time when he did <hi>abase</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the <hi>superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as <hi>hundreds</hi> in this City can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And when he was appointed by a Prelate to satisfie the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of some that did scruple that wicked Oath, <hi>Ex officio,</hi> which he did endeavour to doe, as I am credibly informed. All which I relate to shew that that which he saith of himself is not true, and what little cause he hath to accuse others for things done 12. years agoe, that not many years before was guilty of as bad things himself.</p>
            <p>And whereas he bids <hi>some of Aldermanbury remember Edmundsbury,</hi> I would have him to know, that if it were lawfull to boast, I could tell him, That for 10. <hi>years</hi> I preached at <hi>Edmundsbury faithfully and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> thrice a week. And that there are many now in <hi>Heaven blessing God</hi> for my <hi>Ministery</hi> there; and that I can have the testimony of all the godly people and Ministery in <hi>Bury,</hi> and thereabouts, in a larger manner then is <hi>fit</hi> for me to desire; and that I refused offers of 400<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
               <hi>per annum</hi> to tarry with them; and that I have been often called to return to them, with expressions of their unhappinesse in my departure: but <hi>I am a fool in thus boasting,</hi> let the Reader pardon me, since I am <hi>constrained</hi> unto it. One thing more I will adde, That had not Bishop <hi>Wren</hi> put in his foul feet, to defile those clear waters, I should have lived and died with that people, whom I still love and bear in my heart, and am assured that if M. <hi>Burtons</hi> book come amongst them, they will abominate it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes use of <hi>Edmundsbury</hi> to make me odious to <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But M. <hi>Burton,</hi> pag. 7. <hi>Bids the Scribe put M.</hi> Calamy <hi>in minde how one at Edmundsbury or Rochford, that he might not suffer for the truth, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute his Ministery to all those superstitious and idolatrous Innovations of the Prelates in those daies, whereby he became a snare in Mispeh, both to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and people: And that for so doing, according to divine Canon, he was to be barred from his Ministery as</hi> Ezek. 44.13. <hi>And he bids him tell me the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of</hi> Origen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93169:4"/>The Reader may perceive by these words, and those that follow, pag. 7. and pag. 8. That the <hi>indictment</hi> is drawn in <hi>very high language,</hi> and that I am charged as guilty, not only of <hi>superstition,</hi> but <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> as bad as that of <hi>Origen,</hi> when he offered incense to Idol-gods; and that for so doing, I am for ever to be debarred from my Ministery: Which accusation is so high, as that I cannot but say as the <hi>Archangel</hi> faith, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to this <hi>black bill of indictment,</hi> I say, that so farre as it holds forth to the world any thing that is true, I shall be willing to own it. Of all <hi>Austins</hi> works, there are two books of his which I have ever most prized, and desire most to imitate, his book of <hi>Confessions,</hi> and his book of <hi>Retractations.</hi> Who doth not admire <hi>David</hi> in his Psalms, which we call <hi>poenitentiall,</hi> or <hi>Psalms of spirituall restitution,</hi> wherein he labours to satisfie the Church for the scandall he had given? And <hi>Solomon</hi> also for his <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> or his book of his <hi>spirituall retractations? Chrysostome</hi> observes it of <hi>Paul,</hi> as his greatest honour, that although he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon of God for his sins, yet he is not ashamed to reckon them up to the world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. And therefore, I hope, none shall shew more willingnes in confessing or retracting any thing wherein I have erred. And if I have wanted the fore-wit of innocency, I will not be wanting in the after-wit of godly sorrow and true <hi>repentance.</hi> Thus much I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in generall.</p>
            <p>But in particular to M. <hi>Burton</hi> I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whereas he cals himself, pag. 11. <hi>my elder brother</hi>; he deals in this, not as a <hi>brother,</hi> much lesse as an <hi>elder-brother,</hi> that should have lesse <hi>passion,</hi> and more <hi>discretion.</hi> And whereas he cals me, pag. 9. a <hi>Christian,</hi> he deals with me in this, not as with a <hi>Christian.</hi> For suppose I were guilty of all he writes, yet I would answer him, as <hi>Beza</hi> did the <hi>Papists</hi> (who, because they could not answer his arguments upbraided him with the vices of his youth) <hi>Hihomires invident mihi gratiam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, These men envy me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the free grace of God that hath pardoned these in me.</hi> And as <hi>Austin</hi> answered the <hi>Donatist</hi> (that separated from all the Christian Churches in the world, and affirmed, that there were no true Churches to be communicated withall but theirs, and were also divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst themselves <hi>in minutula frustula,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> saith) who not being able to confute his arguments, reproached him for his former life, when he was a <hi>Manichee, The more</hi> (faith <hi>Austin) you blazon my sins and spirituall diseases to the world, the more will I commend my Physician that hath healed them all.</hi>
            </p>

I say,

               <hi>to all,</hi> &amp;c.

I have often <hi>preached</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Innovations,</hi> and once I did it at a publike Visitation, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question for my labour, and should have been sent for to the <hi>High Commission,</hi> had not <hi>God</hi> raised up a speciall friend to prevent it. I never justified the <hi>Oath ex Officio,</hi> nor ever prosecuted any man or woman at the <hi>High Commission.</hi> I never (to my best remembrance) at any time preached for the <hi>justification</hi> of any of the <hi>Innovations.</hi> In some few things I did, I confesse, conform according to the light I then had, out of the uprightnesse of my heart, not to <hi>avoid suffering for the truth</hi> (the Lord knoweth) though M. <hi>Burton</hi> sitting as <hi>Lord</hi> over my conscience is not ashamed to <hi>judge</hi> of my <hi>intentions,</hi> as well as my <hi>actions,</hi> and to say, <hi>I did it that I might not suffer for the truth: which cannot but be a rash, if not a most unjust censure.</hi> And for those particular things wherein I yeelded, I had the consent of the godly people in <hi>Bury,</hi> who did professe unto me, that if my conscience would give me leave to yeeld to those things, they would not be offended with what I did, nor like my <hi>Ministery</hi> any whit the worser; and how then could that that I did be such a <hi>snare to Ministers and people?</hi> But how will M. <hi>Burton</hi> prove that that which I did was Idolatry, and to be parallel'd with the Idolatry to the <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish gods,</hi> like that of <hi>Origens,</hi> and of the <hi>Christian souldiers</hi> in <hi>Julians time,</hi> and for which I am to be debarred from my <hi>Ministery?</hi> Surely, when he wrote these words he consulted more with <hi>Machivil,</hi> then with his <hi>Bible:</hi> I will answer in his own words, pag. 16 <hi>Calumniate boldly, and some reproach will stick, by this time our stomack being accustomed to the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son under his tongue, hath learned to digest all.</hi> But let M. <hi>Burton</hi> ask his own conscience how far in former times he hath <hi>been guilty of that which he accuseth others.</hi> And if I should be so wicked, I could name some of his brethren of the <hi>Congregationall-Way,</hi> that have yeelded far more to the <hi>Prelates</hi> innovations then I have done.

            <p>Pag. 7. <hi>But you will say, you have repented: Would God it Were a repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance not to be repented of. For Were it so, how could the old spirit of bondage still remain, only turned into the spirit of domination? Or how could there be such an Antichristian spirit in man to oppose the Kingly Government of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ over consciences and Churches, and to persecute all those of this

Way? Or how could men be still so ignorant of the Waies of Christ, and stand out so stifly against them, had they truly bewailed their former superstitious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations? They clamour on us to shew them a Model, a patern of What We hold. We call upon them for sound repentance for their superstitious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in subjection to an Antichristian Hierarchy, according to that,</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The plain <hi>English</hi> of these words is this, That none ever repented of their conformity to <hi>Prelaticall</hi> Innovations, but <hi>Independents.</hi> And that there is a spirit of <hi>domination</hi> in all Ministers that are not of his way: and that the government which he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>intains is the <hi>Kingly</hi> office of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; and that they are all of an <hi>Antichristian</hi> spirit that oppose it: which words savour so much of that spirit of <hi>domination</hi> and <hi>Antichristianisme,</hi> which he condemns in others, as that I wonder M <hi>Burton</hi> is so blinde as not to see it. But I perceive by this very pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge, that let the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Ministers meet never so often to humble themselves by prayer and fasting for their former conformity (as they have of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en done) yet, if they will not turn <hi>Independents</hi> they must still be accounted amongst the number of those, that as M. <hi>Burton</hi> saith, pag. 7. <hi>have been vassals to Antichrist, and defiled themselves with doing the drudgeries of lording Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and Without any more adoe, when occasion is offered, With dry eyes to pretend for Christ in a Way of Reformation.</hi> Surely such kinde of <hi>language</hi> will never gain <hi>Proselytes</hi> to the <hi>Congregationall-Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own particular I crave leave to declare to all that shall read these lines what I have done to manifest my repentance, and let M. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> then judge whether it be a repentance to be repented on, or no.</p>
            <p>First, I went to <hi>Bury,</hi> and there made in a Sermon, a <hi>recantation and retractation</hi> of what I had done, in the hearing of thousands. And this I did before the times turned against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> not out of discontent, nor because I was disappointed of my expected preferment at Court.</p>
            <p>Secondly, After my comming to <hi>London</hi> at the beginning of this <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> I was one of those that did joyn in making <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> which was the first deadly blow to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of late years.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, My house was a receptacle for godly Ministers in the worst of times: here was the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> framed against the Prelates: here were all meetings. I was the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>st that openly before a <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> did defend that our <hi>Bishops</hi> were not only not an <hi>Order</hi> distinct from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but that in Scripture a <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were all one. I blush to sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

how I am provoked to it, and will pardon me. The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth I did these things to make reparation to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> for what wrong I had done Her. For my conscience was at last fully satisfied, that the bringing in of those innovations was but a shoing-horn to draw in, if not the Pope, yet Popery, and it was the grief of my soul that I had had the least hand in ushering in either the one or the other.</p>
            <p>But what is all this, as long as I turn not <hi>Independent?</hi> This will not satisfie M. <hi>Burton.</hi> And therefore he brings that plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord give him a heart seriously to consider the rashness and uncharitablenesse of this speech.</p>
            <p>But he adds, pag. 8. <hi>That such as now glory most in their new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, were they not among the very last that held up the Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Reformation, but what ends in separation. And why may we not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our new Reformation, which in some places hath as much <hi>Scripture puritie,</hi> as the best of theirs, and is joyned with unity also, which theirs want? And what is M. <hi>Burtons</hi> Church, and his new Reformation, that it must lift up it self above all other Churches, and other Reformations? If I may believe reports, there are <hi>divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> not a few among his people, and—But I must not believe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: yet notwithstanding, if M. <hi>Burton</hi> takes leave in a bitter manner to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re from <hi>truth,</hi> as it is from <hi>peace and unitie.</hi> As for the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> let M. <hi>Burton</hi> know, that at a meeting at my house, it was resolved by above a hundred Ministers, after a long debate upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers weighty considerations, that all that could in their judgements submit to the reading of some part of it, should be intreated for a while to continue so to doe. To this our dissenting Brethren, then present did agree, and one of them made a speech to manifest his concordance. This is enough to give any man satisfaction for the late laying of it down. And if M. <hi>Burton</hi> meanes that <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was among the last that held up the <hi>Service Book,</hi> he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly mistaken in this; as he is in many other things, as hundreds can witnesse for me.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavoured to answer so much of the book, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to my former life and conversation. As for my answer to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars, which amounteth to another sheet, I will condemn it to perpetuall silence; and the rather, because as <hi>Jacobs cattell by looking upon the rods, when they did conceive, brought forth cattell speckled and spotted,</hi> Gen. 30.41. So my fear is, left by conversing too much with his bitter invectives, I should also bring forth as angry a Pamphlet as his is, contrary to my <hi>genius,</hi> and naturall temper.
