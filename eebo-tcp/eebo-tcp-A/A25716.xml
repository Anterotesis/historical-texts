            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Account of the Proceedings AT THE GUILD-HALL OF THE CITY of LONDON, On Saturday, <hi>September</hi> 12. 1679.</head>
            <head>With the Subſtance of <hi>Sir Thomas Player's Speech,</hi> AND THE Lord Mayor's Anſwer Thereunto.</head>
            <p>UPon Saturday, <hi>September</hi> the Thirteenth laſt paſt, ſeveral Hundreds of the Principal Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> accompanied Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the LORD MAYOR, and the Court of Aldermen ſitting at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> in the Name of himſelf, and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this City, Addreſſed himſelf to his Lordſhip, to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>THat it was apparent, what Advantage and Encouragement the Duke of <hi>YORK</hi>'s being a PAPIST, gave to the Riſe and Progreſs of this Horrid and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable PLOT, Which the Parliament had already declared to be one of the greateſt Encouragements that the Papiſts had for the carrying of it on: And that what they have already Voted againſt the Duke, we all ought to take ſpecial notice of; for though it came not up quite to a Law, yet it came very nigh it, as being the Voice of all the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> And that Both Houſes of Parliament had Unanimouſly Declared this PLOT, to have been Contrived, and ſtill Carrying on by PAPISTS, againſt the Life of His SACRED MAJESTY, the PROTESTANT RELIGION, and the GOVERNMENT of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48504:2"/>
That therefore all PROTESTANTS are fully ſatisfied, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do ſtill deſign the Murder of His MAJESTY; but that they ſhould find the <hi>Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> would value His MAJESTIES Life at a higher Rate than ever any Princes Life in <hi>Europe</hi> has been valued at: And that for his part he was not afraid of his own Life, eſpecially upon ſo good an Account; for that he was very well aſſured, that though his Enemies ſhould kill him, they would but thereby haſten his departure to a greater Glory.</p>
            <p>That there was a <hi>Popiſh Priest</hi> lately come in, who had made a further and more clear Diſcovery of the Horrid Deſign of Murdering His MAJESTY; That the whole Contrivance was managed at <hi>ROME,</hi> and was to have been ſuddenly Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here, an Account of which he did not doubt but would be publiſhed to the World in a ſhort time;</p>
            <p>That therefore they the Citizens of <hi>LONDON,</hi> Addreſſed themſelves to his LORDSHIP, as their Head and Chief Magiſtrate in the City, and did therefore deſire his LORDSHIP, That their GUARDS might be Doubled; and that inſtead of Two Companies, Four might go Out every Night, They not coming upon DUTY, but Once in Twelve Nights, which would be very eaſie, and which Charge the Citizens were very willing to bear; eſpecially ſince they apprehend that there is as great a neceſſity to ſtrengthen our hands now, as when there went out Eight Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in a night, their preſent Danger being rather greater.</p>
            <p>He offered alſo one Politick Reaſon to his LORDSHIP, which was this, That the late Long Parliament, and alſo the Laſt Parliament, took ſo much Notice of the great Charge, Care and Diligence of the City, for the Preſervation of His MAJESTIES Perſon, and the PROTESTANT Intereſt, which had ſo much influence toward the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the whole Kingdom, that they were extremely inclined to ſhew their good Affection and Kindneſs to the City, by all ways imaginable; And that therefore the Slackning their CARE and GUARDS at ſuch a time as this, (when Danger ſeems as apparent as ever, and the Fears and Jealouſies of the People are ſo very great, as the like were hardly ever known) might poſſibly it may in ſome meaſure leſſen that Kindneſs to the City in the Next Parliament, which was ſo Remarkable in the Laſt; ſince it is no way to be doubted, but the <hi>Popiſh Faction</hi> will endeavor, by all means imaginable, to make the Councels and Advices of the Next Parliament Ineffectual;</p>
            <p>That it cannot be forgot, That Thirteen Years ago this City was a ſad Monument of the Papiſts Cruelty, being brought into a moſt Deplorable Condition, by their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Deſigns: It being now out of all Doubt, That it was they that Burnt the City; And if they had not been Diſappointed, would have Cut our Throats too at the ſame time, while we were endeavoring to ſave the ſmall Remainder of our Goods which the FIRE had left Unconſumed;</p>
            <p>That though Men may ſeem to be regardleſs of their own Lives, yet when the Lives of their Wives, Children, and their Eſtates alſo, are like to be Deſtroyed in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ruine, it calls for pity from the moſt careleſs. And that therefore it was high Time for us to ſeek the Preſervation of the Whole, by all ways in our Power; Concluding, That he would deſire his LORDSHIP to proceed in this Great and Neceſſary Affair, as GOD ſhould direct him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With ſeveral other excellent Expreſſions to this purpoſe, which we ſhould have been very glad, if it had been poſſible for us, to have repeated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the End hereof the People gave a very Great SHOUT, and his LORDSHIP deſired them to Withdraw.</p>

               <head>After a ſhort time the Citizens mere called in, and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip gave them an Anſwer to this purpoſe.</head>
               <p>THat he had conſidered of their deſires, and was very willing to gratiſie them: and thanked them for their Care and Zeal for the preſervation of the Kings life, and of the Proteſtant Religion. And then told them that he could not anſwer their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of himſelf, without calling the Lieutenancy, and therefore he would cauſe the Lieutenancy to meet on Thurſday next; that being the firſt day that would be at liberty from other buſineſs already aſſigned; or elſe they ſhould have been called ſooner, for his Lordſhip told them that he would loſe no time in it; His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alſo further aſſuring them, That as he had both a Life and an Eſtate, ſo he ſhould readily and frankly hazard the loſs of both, in defence of the Proteſtant Religion: His Lordſhip was alſo pleaſed to declare, That he was very well ſatisfied, that there was no perſon who ſerved the City of <hi>London</hi> in the Quality of an Alderman, but would be ready to ſpend his Blood for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Cauſe. His Lordſhip alſo deſired, that for the time to come, they would not be ſo numerous in their Addreſſes, ſince they might as well make known their minds by few, as by many; eſpecially having ſo worthy a perſon to ſpeak for them, as Sir <hi>Thomas Player;</hi> and therefore deſired that Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi> with half a dozen of the moſt eminent Citizens would meet the Lieutenancy on Thurſday next; for that by ſo numerous an Aſſembly as was then preſent, they might poſſibly give ſome occaſion of offence. His Lordſhip alſo told them, that he hoped before Thurſday next there might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſall cut, that might very much conduce to take away the Cauſe of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fears, for that he was very well aſſured the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was making Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for his departure on Tueſday or Wedneſday next.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THat he did not doubt but that his Lordſhip would take all the care that was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the ſecurity of this City and the Proteſtant Religion, and the ſafety and preſervation of the Kings Life in the firſt place, upon which not only the Happineſs of this City, but of the whole Nation depended; and that he took the more liberty ſo to ſpeak, becauſe it was very well known, though to the grief of all good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that there are a certain ſort of men who make it their buſineſs to leſſen the Plot, and ſome would make it no Plot at all, others ſay that it was a Plot made by the Proteſtants, and then caſt upon the Papiſts; others would have it to be altogether a Proteſtant Plot; and that this ſort of Perſons were the moſt dangerous, and had been deſervedly ſtyled PROTESTANTS IN MASQUERADE, adding, That he had rather have to do with an open profeſt Papiſt, than with one of theſe diſguiſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: for that an open Enemy was much more eligible than a falſe Friend: But he hoped that in a little time ſuch kind of perſons would be taken notice of, and receive the reward due to their merits.</p>
               <p>After this the Court adjourn'd into the Common hall, in order to the chooſing a Sheriff for the year enſuing: where ſeveral being nominated, the choice ſeemed to be between Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenks;</hi> and becauſe it appeared ſomewhat doubtful, a Poll was deſired, which being made, the choice fell upon Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was choſen accordingly.</p>
