         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Main and Principal
Study of all Perſons of
what condition ſoever is,
how to divert and paſs away
their Time with moſt Eaſe and
Satisfaction; and likewiſe how to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52615:3"/>
ſoften and leſſen that Perpetual
Stock of Miſeries which Sin and
the Devil have ſo unhappily
brought upon us. This makes
mankind in a continual trouble,
and cauſes them ſtill to exerciſe
their Parts, and ſet their Wits
upon the Rack to find out New
Arts and Tricks; and are always
hoping for New Diverſions to
gratifie their hot and eager deſire
after <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and to quiet and
pleaſe their turbulent and unruly
Paſſions; which when beſt of all,
they may be compared to peeviſh
troubleſom and Froward Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that muſt ſometimes be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
and plaid withall meerly
out of policy. And this makes
Humane Life ſo unquiet and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
ſo ſtrangely reſtleſs and
uneaſie, that nothing can ſatisfie
us but the proſpect, at leaſt, of
thoſe flattering Joys, which <hi>Hopes</hi>
throught a large Teleſcope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52615:3"/>
to our longing Eyes. It's
<hi>Hope</hi> alone that makes us wiſh to
live; and <hi>theſe</hi> are the puffing
Bladders that raiſe us up, bear
us above Water, and keep us
from plunging our ſelves into the
midſt of an Ocean of racking
Doubts and Deſpair; tho oft they
carry us over each rolling Wave,
and daſh us againſt ſome ſecret
Rocks. When a wiſe and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man comes carefully and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to reflect upon all his paſt
and former <hi>Actions,</hi> he finds little
but vain idle <hi>fooleries</hi> not worthy
the conſideration of a Man, and
ſcarce deſerving a ſerious thought;
and in truth would ſooner chooſe
almoſt any ſort of Life rather
than have 'em plaid over once
more; and the very beſt and
pleaſanteſt of 'em would be both
dull and tedious, were they known
before hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52615:4"/>
For this Reaſon it is that we
can never be at reſt, our Active
Souls being perpetually in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
like the Wide Seas, where
Swelling Billows are always work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and beating upon the Shore,
tho the Winds be ne'er ſo ſtill and
calm: ſo that we are always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
and inventing; always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
and deſiring better things
than what we already enjoy, let
our Wants and Reaſons be never
ſo ſmall and inconſiderable. And
for this it is that every Man
of what nature ſoever, ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purſues ſome ſorts of Pleaſures
and Divertiſements or others, tho
but very little and mean, if they
be ſuch as they may hope for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from. Some we find who
greedily deſire nothing but the
groſs Delights of <hi>Senſe;</hi> others
pleaſe and hug themſelves with
the ſordid hopes of <hi>Wealth</hi> and
<hi>Riches;</hi> a third ſort are for grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52615:4"/>
their Curioſity with the
more refined Pleaſures of <hi>Books</hi>
and <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and others feed
upon the Airy Charms of <hi>Honour,</hi>
and the loud Trumpets of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Fame.</hi> And ſo for all others,
who commonly follow thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Delights, which either
the Dictates of the <hi>Natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
or the common Rudiments
of their <hi>Education</hi> guides them
to.</p>
            <p>But the ſureſt and moſt certain
way to gain Quiet and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this World is, ſome ſetled
and Honeſt <hi>Imployment</hi> ſuitable to
our <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Qualities;</hi> and that
accompanied with an <hi>Unſpotted
Reputation</hi> and a <hi>Good Conſcience.</hi> I
mean ſuch a ſetled <hi>Imployment</hi> as
may keep us from being idle, and
free us in a great meaſure from
the ſenſual temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Then I don't queſtion but I
may bring in <hi>Marriage</hi> for a large
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52615:5"/>
and principal ſhare of our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
For this <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of all others,
ſeems to be moſt ſolid and durable,
and what is moſt univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon by all men: it being
a Sacred <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by <hi>God</hi> himſelf when firſt
he made the World; ingrafted by
<hi>Nature,</hi> and ſought after by moſt
men, as a State of Life capable of
affording all thoſe Pleaſures and
Delights which a Voluptuous Man
can ſeek for; all thoſe Comforts
that Vertue and Innocence can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and of ſweetning the many
bitter Portions of this Life. 'Tis
<hi>this</hi> that encreaſes the World, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
Mankind, and keep 'em
from being at an end; and by
<hi>this</hi> we ſee our ſelves renew'd, the
little Images of our ſelves ſtill
growing up as we go down. <hi>This</hi>
is a principal means to keep us
Chaſt and Honeſt, and free us
from the Heavy Clogs of <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52615:5"/>
Which always attend Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Acts. 'Tis <hi>this,</hi> like the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Cement, unites Society,
joyns our Mutual Loves, and
Blooming Joys, and makes us
Happy; for before we were but
half men, and all our Worldly
Delights but half compleat. And
as the moderate Pleaſures of it are
innocent, ſo are the Comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all theſe Bleſſings of a
<hi>Married Life,</hi> yet a <hi>Single One</hi> is
much more to be preferred and
eſteemed beyond <hi>that,</hi> by reaſon
of the many and vaſt advantages
belonging to it. But then it
muſt be ſure to be always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with that <hi>perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency</hi>
and <hi>unſpotted Chaſtity</hi> that
is ſo wonderful ſtrictly required of
all that intend to keep to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
And then indeed this State
of Life may well be termed the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52615:6"/>
beſt and happieſt of all others, it
being perfectly ſtrip'd and diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all the unhappy troubles and
cares of this World; free as the
unbounded light of the Sun,
whoſe Glorious beams do ſhine
o're all the World; and a life
that moſt reſembles that of the
Angels. But theſe indeed are
more peculiar Bleſſings, which
Heaven beſtows on a few, and
never deſign'd 'em for all; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>Single Life,</hi> in the greateſt
part of the World, is ſo far from
being good or commendable, that
it generally proves a dangerous
trap for their <hi>Virtue,</hi> and a gilded
Bait which the Devil ſets to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their <hi>Innocency.</hi> So I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
no longer thereon, nor on
thoſe Ungracious Wretches who
damn and ridicule <hi>Matrimony</hi> as
long as they can get Miſſes for
their own uſe; but ſhall look upon
<hi>Marriage</hi> as a thing not only moſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52615:6"/>
abſolutely neceſſary to keep up
and propagate the World, but
alſo to keep it honeſt.</p>
            <p>If this great and excellent Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of <hi>Matrimony</hi> be ſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
and frequently found ſo
vaſtly contrary to mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Wonder is neither great
nor ſtrange, ſince the main <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns</hi>
and principal <hi>Ends</hi> of it are
too often groſly perverted, and
horribly abuſed, as tho it was an
ordinary indifferent thing, ſcarce
worth a taking notice of. And if
ſuch a State of Life as <hi>Matrimony</hi>
begins raſhly and wickedly, 'tis
nothing ſtrange if we find it ends
fooliſhly and deſperately. When
<hi>Vertues, Mutual Love,</hi> equality in
<hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Ages,</hi> conſent of
<hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>themſelves</hi> are never, or
at leaſt but very ſlightly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the Devil always comes in
for a good part, and is certain to
have a principal ſhare in all ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52615:7"/>
               <hi>Matches.</hi> When he finds that he
can ſo well inſinuate himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Buſineſs, and can have ſo
great a hand in the chief of all
our concerns, there he finds a large
and ſpacious Field to play and
pleaſe himſelf withal; and there
he is ſure to take his full ſwing
of Pleaſure by ſo much indulging
his chief Attribute, <hi>Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then this is a State of
Life of ſuch a vaſt concern, and
upon which depends ſo large a
part of Humane Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
in this preſent World; it
will be the higheſt piece of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
and Folly imaginable,
to venture upon ſuch a ſerious and
ſolemn <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking</hi> without either
Caution or Conſideration. Want
of care is often reckoned as ill and
as dangerous as want of Vertue;
and if this will hold good in any
place, certainly it will in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch importance as this,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52615:7"/>
where all Perſons ought to be
more than ordinary thoughtful,
and to conſider that this is their
laſt and beſt Stake, which ſhould
not be thrown away upon every
ſlight and trivial Occaſion. To
ſee a man run deſperately and
raſhly to his own certain Ruine,
muſt be an unpardonable Fault,
that <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> would ever be
aſhamed of; neither would the
<hi>World</hi> ever acquit thoſe Perſons
(who marry only to pleaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
of the moſt extream mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
were it not already ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
wedded to <hi>Money,</hi> and for
that reaſon alone moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
partial to all its Friends.</p>
            <p>Now a main and principal
thing that cauſes <hi>Marriages</hi> to be
ſo unhappy, and makes this State
of Life ſo miſerable, is the <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi>
of them. This is the great
miſchief that is become ſo <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical;</hi>
and from hence ariſe moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52615:8"/>
of thoſe deadly Feuds and Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and thoſe ſad Misfortunes
and Sorrows that ſo uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a <hi>Marriage-Life,</hi> which like
peſtilential Diſeaſes infect the
whole Maſs of Blood, and put
all things out of order. It is
<hi>this</hi> alone that ſo often deprives
a Wedded Coople of that bright
and ineſtimable Jewel <hi>Content:</hi>
making all their Deſigns and
Actions unſucceſsful and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and their ends moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and miſerable. And it is this
<hi>Content</hi> which is the main and
only <hi>White</hi> to be levell'd at; <hi>it</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very Throne of all our
Happineſs, and the utmoſt height
of our Ambition. And when
<hi>this</hi> is miſſed of, the Perſon is ſo
far from being pitied, that he is
often counted <hi>an obſtinate Fool that
would not, or at beſt but an Ignorant
One, that could not attain to it.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52615:8"/>
As concerning <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi>
it will be very difficult
to determine any thing that
ſhall pleaſe all; and I don't
at all queſtion but a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſons will think themſelves
very highly affronted, when
they once come to find their
own Faults expos'd in their true
and proper colours; for every
Perſon mortally hates to ſee
his ugly Face in a true Glaſs.
There is uſually ſuch a vaſt
diſagreement between <hi>Parents</hi> and
Children in this caſe, that there
is no hopes of ever reconciling
them, for they are always ſo
very partial in their own Caſes,
and ſo madly run into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
that they at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
inſufferable; ſometimes ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
things ſo far, that they ſeem
to try who ſhould bid moſt for
the higheſt place in <hi>Bedlam.</hi> The
<hi>Old Men</hi> always hug themſelves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52615:9"/>
with the Golden Thoughts of
<hi>Intereſt</hi> and a <hi>Name;</hi> and the <hi>Young
Men</hi> with the glittering hopes
which proceed from their own
Fooliſh or Vitious Humours. So
that however the Caſe be given,
one ſide muſt of neceſſity be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded,
for to pleaſe two Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
at once, is next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But to ſhew my ſelf as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
as poſſibly I can, I ſhall
aim at the middle way, and
ſtrive to ſplit the Hair, chuſing
rather to diſpleaſe both Parties in
a juſt Caſe, than humour one in
a falſe.</p>
            <p>Now this ſame keeping exactly
in the <hi>middle way</hi> in all things, is
the great concern that has always
been admired, and ſought after
by the wiſer and more publick
heads of all Ages; a thing much
commended and talked of, but
ever little practiſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
Men are always ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52615:9"/>
much in love with themſelves,
that they believe nothing is Good
or Bad, Juſt or Unjuſt, but only
thoſe things that are for or againſt
their particular Intereſts. And if
a Perſon has a ſetled mind perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
calm and ſerene, and as free
from all Prejudice and Partiality,
'tis but at beſt like an exact and
equal Ballance which ſtands ſtill
whilſt nothing moves it, but yet
is turn'd aſide with the leaſt
breath or blaſt of Wind. So that
this way muſt needs be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to hit on; and in truth 'tis
like a Perſon forced to walk over
a deep Well upon a ſmall Cord;
if the diſtant bottom or his gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
head ſhould make him ſtep
aſide, he's loſt beyond hope; but
if he keeps upon it, he hurts his
Feet, and is ſtill in danger of the
burſting of the Cord. However
I ſhall venture my Fortune, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52615:10"/>
ſome others before me, and ſhall
endeavour to ſhew the unhappy
conſequences in both Caſes; for in
truth there are Vices not to be
ſpared or humoured; tho I have
a very unthankful ſort of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
when I am almoſt certain to
diſpleaſe all ſides.</p>
            <p>But before I come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in theſe Matters, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
thus much, that to compleat
a true and happy <hi>Marriage</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>Vertuous Inclinations, Hearty
Love,</hi> and <hi>True Liking,</hi> ſo that
they may be both of the ſame
Mind, and both have one and the
ſame Intereſt and Concern; and to
make up this, there muſt be a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
agreement in <hi>Ages, Humours</hi>
and <hi>Breeding,</hi> as well as <hi>Religion, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>
and <hi>Fortunes.</hi> Then when
the Perſons are ſo well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
joyned, they may expect to
find all that's Good and Pleaſant,
all that's Sweet and Comfortable,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52615:10"/>
and in a word all the Content
and Satisfaction that this World
will afford.</p>
            <p>But when any of theſe main
and principal <hi>Ingredients</hi> are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if <hi>God</hi> beſtows his worldly
Bleſſings upon ſuch a <hi>Match,</hi> it
will be much to be wondred at,
becauſe in every thing they will
be tempted to claſh and jar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
making their Lives in
continual trouble, like Furious
Storms and Tempeſts, which
often end with Ruine and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi>

theſe three ſorts, namely, Firſt of
<hi>Old Perſons Marrying with Young;</hi>
Secondly, of <hi>Marrying without

            <head>CHAP. II. Againſt Old Perſons Marrying with
Young.</head>
            <p>THis Chapter contains a very
odd ſort of a Subject, which
will, I am ſure, afford matter
enough for Ridicule; for to tye
Old Age and Youth together in
the Matrimonial Nooſe, is a thing
that may well be ranked among
the greater ſorts of Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and which neither <hi>Nature,
Juſtice,</hi> or the <hi>World</hi> can juſtifie
them in. As for <hi>Nature,</hi> there
can be no manner of pretence of
Incitement from <hi>thence</hi> by either
or both Parties; for what can be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52615:12"/>
more unnatural and prepoſterous
than to go about to unite brisk
and ſprightly <hi>Youth</hi> with dull and
ſenſleſs <hi>Age?</hi> They might as well
have undertaken to have joyned
<hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter, Light</hi> to <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
or any other ſuch likely piece
of Buſineſs, as to think with all
the Strength of Imagination to
couple together a young luſty
piece of Fleſh with an old frigid
Statue. Then as for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> it
will never be ſatisfied, for what
greater breach can there be of
<hi>that,</hi> than to joyn two ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Natures together, which will
almoſt certainly be the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of each other, and to entail
a ſtock of Miſery upon Perſons
for term of Life. But for the
<hi>World,</hi> to be ſure <hi>that</hi> will never
excuſe them, but I am confident
will be as forward as poſſible to
laugh at them; and in ſober
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52615:12"/>
ſadneſs ſuch <hi>Matches</hi> ſeem as if
they were deſigned for the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purpoſe. As for my part
ſcarce any thing can ſeem more
ridiculous; for ſuch <hi>Marriages</hi> look
like ſome very ſtrange extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Farce, intended only to ſet all
the Spectators into a huge fit of
laughter. And he that obſerves it
well, would think they rather
deſign'd to make mirth and ſport
for others, than to procure any
manner of ſatisfaction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
For ſome perſons are
hugely pleaſed when they can ſay
<hi>I'm glad I have made you ſport

            </p>
            <p>But to come a little cloſer to
the matter in hand; I'll ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

more unnatural, than for ſuch a
dull Walking Clod of Earth, an
Old Doting Fellow of Sixty, to
fall a Dying, Sighing, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
for a Sprightly Girl of
Sixteen? Certainly it muſt be
very comical to ſee how featly
and trim our ſweet Sir <hi>Courtly</hi>
dreſſes himſelf up for a Ball, or
a Viſit to his Miſtreſs; how
Spruce, Gay and Sparkiſh he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
with his New Tricks and
Fooleries about him; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
how antickly fine he is in all his
Accoutrements, whilſt a very <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys
Face</hi> and a <hi>Deaths Head,</hi> ſhall
brave it out and be called a <hi>Beauty,</hi>
forſooth. Nor can it be leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to ſee how Ape-like he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks
the Cuſtoms and Actions of
the Young <hi>Sparks</hi> and ſhining
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52615:14"/>
               <hi>Beaux</hi> of the Town (whom he
continually envyes and mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hates) and to ſee him how
neatly he practiſes the <hi>Bon Mien,</hi>
the <hi>Good Grace,</hi> the exact pointing
of the Sword to his right Heel,
the genteel role in the Stocken, the
<hi>Allamode</hi> combing of the Wigg,
the careleſs placing of the Hat,
and the other noble accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Town.</p>
            <p>But the beſt of all is to ſee him
addreſſing himſelf, and paying
his <hi>Devoirs</hi> to the bright Goddeſs
his Miſtreſs, where he falls down
right to ſhewing and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his Excellencies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe which he fancies may be
moſt pleaſing and grateful to the
young beautiful Sex. He tells her
<hi>He's ſtrong and luſty, tough and
ſound at heart; and that the Young
Men of this preſent Age are all piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
weak, half-gotten Milkſops, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52615:15"/>
laſting nor able to do ſervice;
and all conſumptive Puny Shrimps,
fit for nothing but to make ſauce of.</hi>
His Miſtreſs perhaps all the while
ſtands liſtning, being ſtruck dumb
with the Charming Rhetorick of
this Venerable <hi>Mumpſimus.</hi> But
ſhould Father <hi>Grey-Beard</hi> perceive
any ſort of Complacency in the
Little Creature by ſimpering,
ſmiling or the like, then he falls
on a freſh to bragging of his Great
and Mighty Feats of Activity, as
how well he can <hi>Run, Leap and
Ride,</hi> and the like. But if by
chance at any time his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
are found to be leſs than
his Pretenſions (for Old Men oft
make tryals) then he comes off
with an idle flam or excuſe, that
<hi>'tis only a Fall, a Strain, or Hurt,
or ſome other accidental Misfortune;
but that he can ſtill Drink and
Wench with the beſt of the Town.</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52615:15"/>
And thus he goes on with ſuch
extravagant Commendations of
his own deer ſelf; all the while
out-ranting a Common <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and out-hectoring a Town
<hi>Bully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Poor Young Girl who
knows little or nothing of the
weighty concerns of <hi>Matrimony</hi>
is perhaps caught at laſt, being
allured into the ſnare with the
gay expectations of being <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi>
forſooth, and with the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Honour of having a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
before ſhe has got over the
long and tedious time of her
teens; or rather (which is more
probable) with the flattering
hopes of riding in a fine gilt
Coach and Six, or with the
harmonious gingling of his <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's;</hi>
or laſtly ſhe is forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by a ſeveer and ridged
<hi>Father,</hi> or ſome baſe mercinary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52615:16"/>
               <hi>Guardian,</hi> who upon all accounts
makes his Markets on her, and
ſells her at what price he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Whilſt jolly Sir <hi>Feeble Fain-would</hi>
leaves no ſtone unturn'd,
but beſtirs himſelf on all ſides
to obtain his deſire; is as buſie
as a Bee, and as merry as the
wanton thoughts of a brisk
young Wife can make him.
But when the Wedding day is
come, then he's all in raptures,
and is tranſported beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
with delicate hopes of a
<hi>Sweet Encounter</hi> as he calls it;
Methinks this conjunction ſeems
far unlike that of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux,</hi> but rather like <hi>Mece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
tying the living and dead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe is all this
ado? Or wdat is the conſequence
of ſuch a hopeful <hi>Match,</hi> but
only the getting himſelf the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52615:16"/>
right Worſhipful Name of <hi>Fool,</hi>
or that more honourable Title
of <hi>Cuckold?</hi> And indeed theſe
dignified Names are not very
hard to be obtain'd, nor much
harder to be deſerv'd. For the
laſt of theſe he is ſure to have,
let his Wife be never ſo Chaſt
and Vertuous; except the <hi>World</hi>
be wonderous civil in this Point;
which I may venture to aſſure
him is no common Obligation.
For the Common People, as
the times go now, have got an
ugly ſcurvy trick of ſpeaking
as they think when they find
no inducement to the contrary.
But this is not all; from
<hi>Sayings</hi> they'll commonly fall
to asking of <hi>Queſtions;</hi> as <hi>What
kindneſs ſhe can have for ſuch a
Boyiſh piece of Gravity; what real
Comforts can ſhe find in the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Society of a fond jealous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52615:17"/>
who ſuſpects all that either
look at or ſpeak to her, and dreads
nothing like what he knows he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves?
And what true ſatisfaction
can ſhe have by embracing a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and being all night by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom
Neaſt of Diſeaſes, a Cold
Lump of Clay, whoſe utmoſt Power
is only to encreaſe deſires, and ſet
an Edge upon that Appetite, which
he can by no means ſatisfie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Perſons that are ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and exact in asking <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of one ſide, without doubt
won't be backwards in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
but will ſtily demand,
<hi>Where are the great Pleaſures and
ſweet Delights ſuch a Husband can
take when he finds himſelf fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a peeviſh ilnatur'd Wife that
moſt certainly hates him, and at
every turn wiſhes him hang'd, or
at the Devil; a very kind Creature!
Who inſtead of comforting and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52615:17"/>
him, plagues and torments
him? One that cares for nothing but
his Money, fears nothing more than
his preſence, and wiſhes for nothing
more than her Gallants Company,
and her Husbands End?</hi> Theſe
are only Queſtions 'tis true, but
they are good comfortable ones
however, and ſuch as would
make the <hi>Old Man's Wiſh</hi> tuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
all weathers. No doubt but
our <hi>Heroe</hi> will find a huge
deal of Pleaſure in being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
tongue wearied to death
by a ſcreaming ſhrill Voice, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than the Waters of <hi>London</hi>
Bridge, or the <hi>Chataracts</hi> of <hi>Nile;</hi>
and now and then for a pure
breathing Diverſion, to have his
Bald Pate moſt civilly ſaluted
with a good Brown Cudgel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being gently <hi>rub'd by a
cleanly young Girl;</hi> or to have a
Bucket of fine cool Water
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52615:18"/>
thrown upon him, when he
has far more need of a warm
Bed and a good Cordial to chear
up his Old Heart. It will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be a wonderful ſatisfaction to
him to have two or three bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brats got for him by ſome
good Neighbour, hanging about
him and calling <hi>Daddy, Daddy!</hi>
Perhaps this wiſe Fool of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
can hug himſelf with belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he was inſtrumental in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch bouncing Boys at this
Age, when his kind <hi>Wife</hi> and
Obliging <hi>World</hi> know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
are the common and (I
may ſay) almoſt certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of all ſuch <hi>Matches;</hi>
and whatſoever Miſeries and
Troubles the Husband meets
withal in theſe Caſes, he can't
ſo much as comfort himſelf
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52615:18"/>
with that poor and mean plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of being <hi>pitied.</hi> The World,
tho never in ſuch a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
will but laugh at all his
complaints, and abuſe him for
what he has done, ſaying, <hi>Now
he's paid for all his Old Tricks;
the Old Sot is right enough ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
who bid him play the Fool
in his Old Days?</hi> Nay more
than all this, the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Rogueries, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
pieces of Villanies ſhall be
called <hi>Acts of Juſtice</hi> forſooth.
Sometimes indeed we meet with
a very extraordinary kind ſort
of Women, who ſtily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the common and frequent
diſtempers of Old Age; and to
eaſe the dear ſweet Husbands
of their many cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of this preſent World, do
ſometimes give them a gentle
Puſh into the next: but this falls
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52615:19"/>
out as their old Friend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and they can agree.</p>
            <p>Having made a few Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
and conſider'd the Tricks
and Ways of the <hi>Old Men</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
let us face about to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, and take a ſmall
View of the <hi>Old Women,</hi> who
can't forget the pleaſures of
Youth, but muſt be ſporting
and playing ſtill, tho juſt at the
Graves Mouth. Certainly this
ſight can be no leſs ridiculous
and ſtrange than the other; to
ſee an old decay'd worn out <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
caſt by a Vail and fairly ſet
up for a <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi>
when her ſhrivel'd Skin looks
like ſo much Parchment, and
ſerves only for a courſer ſort
of Bag to carry her tatter'd
Limbs and decay'd Joynts in:
with an ugly <hi>Hags</hi> Face,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52615:19"/>
looking like the true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of <hi>Envy.</hi> And all this in
expectation of catching ſome
young Woodcock in a Fools
Trap, whom ſhe doubts not
but to out-wit ſufficiently, and
ſhew him a ſly trick for all his
deſimulation; or perhaps of
ſtriking up a Bargain with ſome
Puny Small <hi>Wit,</hi> whom ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
eaſily to bring up to her
hand, and manage him which
way ſhe pleaſes. Tho by the
way <hi>Fools</hi> for the moſt part are
worſt edg'd tools to meddle
withal, and the moſt unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable
Creatures under the
Sun.</p>
            <p>Now to obtain her Ends (that
is to ſay a <hi>Husband)</hi> 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſeem brisk and Young
again; and to run back ten
years in ſuch a caſe is but a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52615:20"/>
ſmall matter. For this reaſon
ſhe falls to uſing all the affected
Smiles, antick Tricks, and toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Actions ſhe can think of;
ſtill practiſing the Genteel Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Body, the ſtately
carrying of the Head, the neat
ſide glance of the Eye, the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
toſſing of the Fan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then
to ſhew that all her merry days
are not over yet, ſhe's chaunting,
gigling, and moving her Body
at every ſcraping tune ſhe hears.
And ſhe prates and talks the
whole Company to ſilence; (for
when the Teeth are fled, the
Tongue ſeldom lie ſtill) and all
her Diſcourſe is of <hi>Fine Balls,
Dancing Bouts, Weddings, Merry
Meetings, Gay Gallants, Miſtreſſes,
Intreagues</hi> and the like. The
defects of her Old Wrinkled
Face muſt be carefully ſupply'd
by <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Patch</hi> and <hi>Paint</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52615:20"/>
muſt be made uſe of to fill up
thoſe Furrows which <hi>Old Time</hi>
with his Iron Teeth has ſo
well and plentifully beſtowed
upon her. As for Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtrait or crooked, her Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
can beſt fit that. But theſe
indeed are diſguiſes too affected
and mean, to be of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
uſe in theſe concerns,
being in the readieſt way to
make the buſineſs more odious
and ridiculous; for all ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
things carry with them
a deformity ſo groſs, as can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be conceal'd.</p>
            <p>When ſhe finds theſe little
Tricks to fail in the intended
promotion of her purpoſe (as
one may venture to ſwear they
will) more ſubſtantial Means
are then to uſed; and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way left, is to give out <hi>ſhe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52615:21"/>
has good ſtore of Gold,</hi> as a thing
that ſeldom fails, and is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make amends for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Imperfections and Defects
whatſoever: for that, like the
glorious Sun, is never Old or
Ugly, but always Brisk and
Charming, Young and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
With theſe gay hopes ſhe

Gaming <hi>Fop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or crack'd <hi>Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee,</hi>
who when he is admitted
to the Favour of a Viſit, ſwears
to her <hi>by all that's Good, 'tis her
excellent Perſon he admires and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores
before all the Wealth and
Granduer in the World; and 'tis her
Diſcretion, Gravity, Vertue, and</hi>
(ſometimes for variety ſake)
<hi>Beauty, which he values and eſteems
infinitely beyond her Money;</hi> with
a great many of ſuch faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>pieces of Gallantry</hi> (as they
are called) which every Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52615:21"/>
that is not blind and ſenſleſs
may ſee through, and perceive
both the Knavery and Folly of.
And truly this is no great and
wonderful thing now a-days to
ſee ſuch baſe perſons as theſe ſo
ſeriouſly to ſwear and lye for
ſomething, when they do it
ſo very often for nothing at
all.</p>
            <p>This formal <hi>piece of Antiquity</hi>
(you muſt ſuppoſe imagining
ſomething extraordinary in her
ſelf) believes all he ſays, and
perhaps as much more; then
pincking up her formal Face
with a ſimpering kind of
ſmile ſhe tells him <hi>She cannot
believe but he's a meer Wag, a
very Wag all over, and only
diſſembles and flatters to wheedle
kind hearted Creatures; but yet ſhe
vows that theſe ſame Young Men
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52615:22"/>
have always a very ſtrange taking
way with them, and will never be
ſaid nay when they are once ſet on.</hi>
upon this with a Complement
and a gracious Smile on her
ſide, and a fawning Leer on
his, with the Formalities of a
ſecond or third Viſit, a Match
is clap'd up between the Old
Fool and the Young. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
expecting great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things, but he gueſſing before-hand
what he is like to meet
withal, ſeldom comes at her,
paſſes away his time merrily,
and cares but little (as long as
the Money goes briskly about)
which end goes forward; So
that at beſt he is only as a kept
Perſon in continual Fee. But
this won't do with him, for
he'll make her to know who's
Lord and Maſter, and ſince his
old <hi>Grannam of a Spouſe</hi> can't
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52615:22"/>
pleaſe him, her Mony muſt then
procure him ſuch a one as
can.</p>
            <p>But what ſays the World to
all this? O wonderous civil!
as may be gueſſed by that
obliging language which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
<hi>Oh hang her</hi> (ſays one)
<hi>for an Old Beaſt; muſt ſhe be for
riding at this time of day? She's
paſt Mans uſe now, 'tis high time
to fall to procuring. Ay</hi> (ſays a
ſecond) <hi>what ſhould ſhe do but
procure a good bit for her poor Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and help him at a dead lift? Rot
her Old Corps</hi> (ſays a third) <hi>ſhe's
good for nothing but to make mony
of.</hi> But he, for his part, ſhall
be applauded, and commended
for what he does, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for all his fine Rogueries,
and ſhe her ſelf muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to bear the brunt of all.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52615:23"/>
People are ſtrangely pleaſed to
find <hi>ſhe's met withall at laſt,</hi> and
wonderfully pleaſed at every
trick he ſerves her, if he ſhould
bring a Miſs publickly to his
Houſe, or ſome ſuch ſlighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
or if he entertains her
every day with the ſweet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
of <hi>Damn me</hi> and <hi>Rot me</hi>
Sparks. But if he chance to find
the advantage of touching her
<hi>Copy-hold;</hi> of making the dirty
Acres fly about, the old Houſes
to go to Pot, and the tall ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Oaks to rore; that's mirth
and ſport enough for a month
at leaſt.</p>
            <p>I will not inſiſt any longer
upon the ill effects and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Misfortunes of ſuch <hi>Matches</hi>
as theſe; and ſhall omit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
grateful returns theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
may expect from their
Children and other Relations,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52615:23"/>
who are very often fool'd out
of good Eſtates by theſe means,
and New Heirs ſeldom fail of
being produc'd, tho 'tis not in
every mans power to get 'em.
In my opinion the beſt Uſe and
greateſt Advantage that can be
made of ſuch <hi>Matches</hi> is <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
and <hi>Mortification.</hi> For ſuch
Old Wives and Husbands (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the many Afflictions they
cauſe) may indeed prove a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Memento Mori</hi> than any
<hi>Deaths Head;</hi> and perhaps give
perſons a more lively hint of
Mortality than a <hi>Skull</hi> can do.
Such ſort of <hi>Marriages</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be well compared to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man Neck and Heels,
and leaving him to ſhift for
himſelf, whilſt his ſtrugling
only makes him worſe. But
how great ſoever the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
are, they have always an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52615:24"/>
original ſo very ridiculous, that
they are things more to be
laugh'd at than pityed, which
have made me leſs ſerious in
this Chapter than I thought to
have been, or perhaps will be
counted agreeable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Rules of <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Modeſty;</hi>
and truly I am very much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to handle this Subject any
longer.</p>
            <p>Before I finiſh this Chapter, I
muſt deſire the Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to take notice, that in all
this Diſcourſe there is not any
thing ſpoken with the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
or intention to bring <hi>Old
Age</hi> into contempt; for I always
held <hi>that</hi> to be a thing that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
the greateſt <hi>Eſteem, Honour</hi>
and <hi>Veneration</hi> imaginable. But
let all Old Perſons take this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, that it will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be counted baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptable,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52615:24"/>
and a Curſe inſtead
of a Bleſſing, while <hi>it</hi> wants the
Ornamental Marks of <hi>Gravity,
Judgment</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> which
always ought to carefully attend
it, and be inſeparable; and that
a merry Old Fool, and a gay
apiſh Matron are things ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
that a very Ingenious
Perſon has deſervedly reckoned
them among the tamer ſort of
Monſters.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Againſt Perſons Marrying without
the Parents or Friends Conſent.</head>
            <p>THE main deſign of this
Chapter is to ſhew the great
imprudence and impiety of all
ſuch as run raſhly, or without
Friends knowledg or conſent,
upon ſuch a ſolemn thing as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony;</hi>
with the ſad and fatal
conſequences thereof; which
will be enough, I'm ſure, to
deter all Perſons of any Senſe
or Religion from ſtealing of
<hi>Matches,</hi> or ſuffer themſelves to
be ſtolen by others. This is
a great and abominable Crime
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52615:25"/>
which has grown wonderful
common in theſe late times;
and for ought we can hear
more frequent in our Nation,
than in our Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
eſpecially for the Female
Sex, becauſe they are allowed
more Liberty here, than in moſt
other <hi>Parts.</hi> Though within
theſe few Years there hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more care been taken to
prevent theſe Inconveniencies,
and <hi>Licences</hi> have been more
cautiouſly deliver'd; yet ſtill
we find frequent Examples of
this nature to the great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of the Perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſometimes to the
Ruin of their Families. And
we can't expect it will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
as long as there are ſome
at every turn ready in the
<hi>Dukes-Place,</hi> the <hi>Mint,</hi> or ſome
ſuch Priviledg'd corner of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52615:26"/>
Town, who will do this ſmall
Job of <hi>Coopling</hi> without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
formality of a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>
or the little conſideration
of the <hi>Canonical Hour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt ſpeak a word or
two concerning ſuch Men as
ſteal Perſons much above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves
in <hi>Fortune,</hi> (for I
can afford ſuch vile Practices
no better title than ſtealing.)
For though this at preſent is
reckon'd little or no fault in
the Man's part, and the moſt
ridgid and cenſorious part of
the World ſeldom lay any
thing to his charge: Yet for my
part I can moſt clearly and
plainly ſee ſomething in it that's
moſt <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>ungenerous,</hi> which
is far beneath the great and
noble Thoughts of <hi>Man.</hi> For
to pretend <hi>Love</hi> in this caſe, is
almoſt as ridiculous as the <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52615:26"/>
that very fairly fell in Love
with Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> ſo that
the Perſon can have no manner
of Colour for his <hi>Deſign in hand</hi>
but a greedy thirſting after <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
and an eager perſuing after
thoſe <hi>Riches</hi> which he hath no
ſort of Title to, and gets 'em as
unjuſtly as Pirates and Robbers
do their Booty. Beſides, to <hi>Marry</hi>
purely for <hi>Money,</hi> without any
other conſiderations, ſeldom
fails of cauſing an unhappy
Life: And common Experience
ſhews us that ſuch Perſons as
theſe have very ſeldom any
manner of real <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Kindneſs</hi>
for their <hi>Wives,</hi> though they be
never ſuch Accompliſh'd, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and Deſerving Ladies;
then to what a fine paſs have
theſe poor Creatures brought
themſelves to?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52615:27"/>
Let all your High Lookers,
and great Pretenders to large
<hi>Fortunes</hi> but ſeriouſly conſider,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> What a vaſt piece of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi>
'tis to Rob a <hi>Loving Father</hi>
of a <hi>Daughter</hi> in which he places
ſo great a part of his <hi>Delight;</hi>
to take his deereſt <hi>Jewel</hi> from
him; and violently to tear a
lovely Blooming <hi>Sprig,</hi> which
he has Nuriſhed with ſo much
care and tenderneſs: And though
the Night promiſes well, the
Horſe ſtands at the Gate, the
Doors open, the Riding-Grown's
on, the Lady ready, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
waiting, and all things
ſmile and favour the Deſign,
running very ſmothly a long;
yet in a ſhort time after they
are chain'd together, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
ceaſeth, the Inchanted
Caſtle Vaniſhes into fleeting Air;
the Tempeſt riſes, and whole
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52615:27"/>
ſhowers of Afflictions fall thick,
imbittering all their Joys, and
deſtroying all their fine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Let them all
conſider what a high piece of
<hi>Imprudence</hi> 'tis for a man ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
to venture himſelf
with a young Creature, whoſe
fickle Fancy turns like the wind,
and whoſe ungrounded Love oft
upon ſuch accounts meet with
its cold and loathing Fits, and
curdles to Hatred in a few hours
time, which by the overſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power of flattering and
and threatning Friends may
bring his Life at her Mercy.
Beſides, if he marry ſuch when
her <hi>Portion</hi> is not certain, he
commits a double Folly to no
purpoſe; and then his <hi>Love for
Mony</hi> has left him in a very
ſweet pickle indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52615:28"/>
But now to come a little
cloſer to the buſineſs of <hi>Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without Friends conſent,</hi> and
to ſhew the greatneſs of this
Offence. It always ought to be
conſidered that <hi>Nature</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Parents</hi> an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power over their <hi>Children,</hi>
making far greater diſtinctions
here than in any other Perſons
whatſoever. And as this ſort
of <hi>Government</hi> is certainly the
moſt natural of any, ſo all
other <hi>Governments</hi> ſeem rather
to have been made in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this <hi>Firſt Method;</hi> being
for the moſt part <hi>Acquired</hi> by
Uſurpation and meer Force,
and increaſed by the Strength
and Policy of more crafty heads.
As <hi>Parents</hi> Authority is great,
ſo ought <hi>Childrens</hi> Obedience to
be great too; and all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
and Satisfaction they are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52615:28"/>
ever able to make for their
<hi>bringing of them into the World,
Education, Eſtates,</hi> and the like,
is only a dutiful complyance
to all their juſt Commands,
and a hearty deſire of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their good Wiſhes. Here
it is that a Young Man ſhews
his noble temper, as well as
humble diſpoſition; and 'tis this
that <hi>Heaven</hi> promiſes ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Bleſſings to, and that the
<hi>World</hi> has ſo oft crown'd with
its juſt Applauſes.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Marriage</hi> is the greateſt
concern, and the Principal thing
in which a <hi>Parent</hi> always takes
moſt care; and to ſee them
well Matched is as much as to
ſee 'em made happy: So for a
Son or a Daughter to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to this, is the greateſt
piece of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as well as the
higheſt point of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52615:29"/>
can well be guilty of. This
indeed has made many a <hi>Father</hi>
(and that with Juſtice too)
utterly caſt off a hot-brain Son
from all his future care; and
whoſe unlucky <hi>Curſes</hi> have hit
him ſo right, and ſtuck ſo cloſe
to him ever after, as have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him to the utmoſt Miſeries
that attend Poverty and Rags.
The greatneſs of this Crime
few young Perſons conſider, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo extreamly partial and
ſelf-conceited of their own <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and <hi>Judgment</hi> in chooſing;
laughing at their own <hi>Parents</hi>
and <hi>Friends,</hi> thinking them all
very unfit Perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
withal, and not Good or
Wiſe enough to chooſe for
them; but will run madly and
furiouſly on, big with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of ſome wonderful
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52615:29"/>
               <hi>Charms</hi> and extraordinary <hi>Bliſs,</hi>
till they are ſoon foundred and
loſt, like one that rides a fiery
Steed that ſtops at nothing but
runs at Swelling Rivers, Crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Rocks and Deadly Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
till the Rider is hurl'd off
and daſhed in pieces. Theſe
are the ſurious tranſports of
Harebrain Youth, who run
mad for a <hi>Face,</hi> and ruin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for a meer <hi>trifle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all things be throughly
and carefully conſidered, ſuch
a Crime as this muſt appear
extraordinary ſoul and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and of ſuch a Baſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as can never be excuſed
by an unconcerned Stander by,
ſuch as I profeſs my ſelf to be.
To have a kind indulgent <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
whoſe ſofteſt Wiſhes, and
greateſt Joys, always attend his
<hi>Sons</hi> good Fortune; careful of him
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52615:30"/>
even to the raging Paſſion of
Jealouſie, to beſtow his utmoſt
Pains, uſe his greateſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and ſtill racking his
contriving Head both day and
night; and all with the joyful
expectation of his <hi>Sons</hi> being
great and happy after his death,
and placing the greateſt part
of his own Happineſs in his:
then to have a ſtubborn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greateful
<hi>Son</hi> to daſh and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the whole Fabrick of his
great Deſigns, and by one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Caſt, blaſt all his thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hopes at once. This is
too much for a <hi>Father</hi> to bear,
and then 'tis no wonder to ſee
a <hi>Parent</hi> (tho never ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and good Natured) decree
the utmoſt ſeveritys, and at one
blow to lop off a Monſtrous
Excreſcency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52615:30"/>
That this Offence is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Diſinheritance,</hi> there's
ſcarce any thing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
and a <hi>Father</hi> in this caſe
is very ſeldom much blamed,
or reckoned ſevere or unjuſt;
for when a <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter</hi>
have by their Diſobedience
broke their <hi>Fathers</hi> Heart, and
and have thrown him off as a
Perſon that has nothing to do
with them; he has a good and
honeſt Plea to leave them to
themſelves. Some <hi>Fathers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are often glad to find
ſuch an <hi>Excuſe</hi> when they have
a mind to put off their <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
without <hi>Portions,</hi> becauſe
they are ſure that <hi>this</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
vindicate their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the inquiring World.
So that it is moſt apparent that
this is a far greater Crime than
moſt young People take it to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52615:31"/>
be; ſo that for a man of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi>
and <hi>Generoſity</hi> to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſuch a fault, to me ſeems
very inconſiſtant Neither can
I well conceive how a man of
ſenſe can ever excuſe himſelf
from ſuch a prodigious piece
of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> ſince <hi>that</hi> of all
other Vices is juſtly eſteem'd
the baſeſt and meaneſt, and of
ſuch a Nature, that even thoſe
Perſons who have ſeemed to
make their buſineſs and deſign
to act and brag of all other
Rogueries, are yet aſhamed of
<hi>that,</hi> and are very careful to
conceal it, as a <hi>thing</hi> that can
get them no manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
or Applauſe, not ſo
much as among their rude
Companions.</p>
            <p>But let us now ſpend a thought
or two about the <hi>Female Sex.</hi>
As for <hi>thoſe, Nature</hi> has ſeem'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52615:31"/>
to take a more peculiar Care
in moulding them and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them more eaſie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant;
and of giving them a
ſofter and more flexible Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
ſinely adapted to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But to the <hi>Male</hi> it has
afforded a ſtronger and more
governing Nature, and has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them more Power and
Command. Therefore Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Compliance in the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi>
ſeems more convenient and
neceſſary, as being more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and natural. And if all
things be rightly conſidered,
they are not to expect to be
their own Carvers in all things,
nor to have ſo large a right
in chooſing as <hi>Men</hi> Their
Friends Care and Judgment is
always rationally looked upon
as far more fit and proper for
the choice of what will be for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52615:32"/>
their happineſs and Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than their own fond Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
which proceed from an
unſetled Fancy. So that their
main and principal care in
this Life ought to be how to
ſoften thoſe troubles, and how
to make that pleaſant and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
which falls to their ſhare,
if they ſhould chance to meet
with a <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Humours,</hi> not
altogether ſo well and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as might have reaſonably
been wiſhed for.</p>
            <p>The truth of all this will
eaſily appear, and become as
clear as the Sun, if we come
carefully to conſider and reflect
upon the Unſteady Nature and
Unſatisfied Diſpoſition of <hi>Youth,</hi>
and eſpecially of the <hi>Female
Sex,</hi> whoſe Reaſons are for the
moſt part byaſſed by their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and not ſtrong enough
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52615:32"/>
to diſcern and ſearch into thoſe
things which are beſt for a
<hi>Setled</hi> and <hi>Married</hi> Life. For
their Fancies are almoſt always
carrying them aloft, which
makes their Brains giddy, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
their Reaſons, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them about through by-Paths
and uncertain Places, like
an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> and at laſt
looſes them in a wild deſolate
Wilderneſs. It will be much
more apparent and viſible, if
we look upon <hi>Examples,</hi> which
frequently ſhews us how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
unfortunate many young
<hi>Women</hi> are in their choice,
when it has depended wholly
upon themſelves. And further,
it is very common to find thoſe
very Ladies that have been ſo
extreamly <hi>nice,</hi> ſo wonderfully
<hi>curious</hi> and difficult to pleaſe,
diſdaining and laughing at all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52615:33"/>
that look like the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and
ſcorning and diſpiſing all that
ſeem <hi>mean</hi> or <hi>common;</hi> ſo that
one would think, nothing leſs
could ſatisfie them than an <hi>Angel</hi>
dropt from the Clouds: Yet
(I ſay) 'tis very uſual for theſe
<hi>Mock-Criticks</hi> at laſt to throw
themſelves under the ſubjection
of Whimſical Flutring <hi>Fop,</hi> or
a meer ſtarched and joynted
Bartholomew Puppet, whoſe
Stock of Wit and Mony is as
ſmall as his Impertinence and
Impudence is large.</p>
            <p>If we do but obſerve the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the Young Ladies
of this our Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who pretend
ſo much to <hi>Modiſhneſs</hi> and the
like; we cannot but wonder to
find ſo many Inconſiſtencies,
and to ſee with what large
mixtures of <hi>Fickleneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
Vanity</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſetled Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52615:33"/>
they are made up withal.
How difficult to pleaſe, how
critical in fooliſh trifles, how
Extravagant and Finnical in
their Attire; how wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delighted with all that's gay
and glittering, how ſtrangely
ubounding in Diſcourſe, how
toyiſh and freakiſh in their
Actions; having vitiated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
that can reliſh nothing
that's Grave or Serious, or can
endure any thing that's pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or diſcreet: We may (I
ſay) when we conſider all this,
well enough conclude that that
Perſon who courts one of them,
and deſires to gain her, needs
only a gay lac'd Coat rather
than a decent one, to pleaſe
her nice Fancy; an Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Tongue (like Sir <hi>Formal
Trifles)</hi> overlaid with Fuſtian
and Bombaſt Words rather
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52615:34"/>
than ſenſe, to hold her in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe;
and a Maggotiſh Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
well ſtuffed with Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
(like Sir <hi>Poſitive at all)</hi>
to make her believe any
thing.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch ſort of Perſons
as theſe, common experience
ſhews us that <hi>Dancing-Maſters</hi>
and <hi>Singing-Maſters</hi> have chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the greateſt influence; the
one by the nimble ſhaking of
his Heels, and the other by
the cunning quavering of his
Voice, ſo melting and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poor Pool, that ſhe's
all upon the ſighing whining
Vein, till ſhe's ſtark mad to be
delivered from her old Fathers
Clutches. And this is much
more likely if Age has not
ſtrengthned her Reaſon, or
ripened her Underſtanding ſo
far as to diſtinguiſh between gay
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52615:34"/>
things and good things, and
to diſcern the fatal effects of
ſuch Baſeneſs: and this brings
her to laugh at the kind and
wholeſome advices of a <hi>Father,</hi>
and to look upon her <hi>Friends</hi>
as all peeviſh, ſilly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
Perſons that deſerve not
a ſerious thought to be thrown
away upon them. After this
indeed Years may harden her
in her wickedneſs, and help her
to a large ſtock of Impudence,
but they ſeldom teach her any
Prudence or Diſcretion, for her
ridiculous Follies and ſtubborn
Vices will yet grow ſtronger
with her Age; like gliding Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and flowing Streams, ſtill
encreaſing the further they run
from the Fountain-head. But
the poor ſelf-deceiving Creature
ſeldom looks about her, till the
manifeſt appearance of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52615:35"/>
Ruin from an inhumane
curſt Husband opens her Eyes
to ſome purpoſe, and ſhew her
that all the Wit and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhe have got are the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
things ſhe ever purchaſed
before now.</p>
            <p>Thus we find many ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this Nature, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Young Perſons who run
raſhly and without any ſort of
Conſideration to get themſelves
married, never minding any
thing that belongs to ſuch a
Condition, but thoſe vain flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Pleaſures that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
hopes preſent to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
view through a corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and falſe <hi>medium.</hi> 'Tis of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſeen that many a poor
Young Girl is trickt and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Matrimony</hi> to the great
grief of her Parents, and her
own laſting Torment; and that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52615:35"/>
too when ſhe has but a ſmall
knowledge of the troubleſome
cares and concerns of this World,
and before ſhe well underſtand
what a <hi>Husband</hi> means, or what
and where lyes the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
and Inconveniencies that
a Married Life is capable of.
And perhaps the Perſon that
did it is ſome debauched beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
Rakehel, ſome baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Fellow, whoſe <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
Paſſion</hi> will never raiſe his
drowſie Soul above the ſmell of
<hi>dirſt;</hi> and deſires nothing but
<hi>Mony,</hi> which he ſo greedily
devours and ſwallows down to
his Wives ruine, and his own
Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now the main Source from
whence theſe Paſſions (on the
mans account) do riſe, and the
chief Spring that moves ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
young mens Affections, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52615:36"/>
hurries away their Reaſons
from paying the Reſpects
due to their <hi>Parents,</hi> is <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
an Object that always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys
ſomething with it ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and Charming, as can
never be well defined or deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
And 'tis <hi>this</hi> that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times ſets Unſteady Youth
all in a raging fire, ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
toſſing his tempeſtuous Soul,
and ſo forcibly carrys him on
towards his <hi>Imaginary Bliſs,</hi> that
the loud crys of <hi>Reaſon</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be heard, but only when
it comes with a gentle ſmile,
to favour the cauſe in hand,
and plead for that ſoft Paſſion:
and this cauſes them ſometimes
to be ſo extravagant as to
make <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> of Women <hi>(An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
at leaſt) and place even
<hi>Divinity</hi> it ſelf in a poor ſilly
Mortal. Then you'l hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52615:36"/>
from him but <hi>Wiſhing,
Complaining, Sighing, Languiſhing</hi>
and <hi>Diſpairing;</hi> of <hi>Charming
Pleaſures, Gentle Flames, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Hearts, Melting Tears,</hi> and
the like; and all his Diſcourſe
ſhall be about his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> of
vindicating her to all the
World, of undertaking all deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Attempts, and Dying
for her three or four times a
Day. Theſe things tho fooliſh
enough, are true, and oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
more Pity than Laughter;
for <hi>Beauty</hi> the chief cauſe of all
this, is like a cruel <hi>Baſilisk</hi> that
often kills us at diſtance, and
before we know any thing of
it.</p>
            <p>The Old Men indeed come
bluntly to their Sons, and tell
them that <hi>Beauty will buy no
Beef;</hi> (a courſe Complement
to one up to the Ears in Love)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52615:37"/>
But the Young Men as pertly
reply, <hi>It will buy Content which
is far better;</hi> an Anſwer truly
ſufficient, and of full force we
grant, if it were as true as the
other. But this we frequently
find ſo far from procuring any
real ſatisfaction or <hi>Content,</hi> that
it has many times been the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Cauſe of the greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and Afflictions that can
befall a <hi>Marryed Life.</hi> And if
Prejudice be wholly laid aſide,
'twill eaſily be ſeen that ſcarce
ever any <hi>Marriage</hi> has been on
both ſides happy, that had no
other Foundation than what
comes from the Charms of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<hi>Beauty;</hi> which indeed is
far more fit to increaſe a Mans
Appetite, than to ſettle any
true Liking, and will ſooner
procure Fondneſs than real
Love; the fatal Effects of which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52615:37"/>
is <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> that curſed Bane to
all the Pleaſures of the <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Bed,</hi>
which makes their beſt
Delights a raging Torment,
and turns the greateſt Bleſſings
into the greateſt Plagues. So
that to have <hi>this</hi> without Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is a thing that none but
ſtupid and ſenſleſs Perſons would
endure; For then 'tis like a
hot burning Coal whoſe bright
and ſparkling looks many may
gaze on with admiration e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but none but Fools and
Madmen are willing or daring
enough to touch. For who
but ſuch a Madman would for
the gratifying of his fancy run
and throw himſelf into the
devouring Flames? Who for a
few tranſient fits of Joy would
part with all the Pleaſures of
his ſoft and ſweet Repoſe? Who
for the Honour of Embracing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52615:38"/>
a painted Cloud, would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
both his Heaven of Content
here, and his Heaven of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
hereafter, by being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
upon the rack of <hi>Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi>
and tormenting Fears, leaſt
his Beautiful <hi>Jezebel</hi> prove falſe,
and another admire that Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
Face which he himſelf
formerly doated on.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider <hi>Beauty</hi> by its
ſelf, and quite ſtript of all
thoſe Ornaments ſhe borrows
from the Arts and Tricks of
others; for her upper Decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhe gets from common
<hi>Shop keepers</hi> and <hi>Tyre-women,</hi> her
lower ones from <hi>Taylors</hi> and
<hi>Brokers,</hi> and her ſweet raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Complexion very often
from a little Stuff that comes
from a <hi>Painters</hi> Pencil, which
ſometimes dawbs her over like
a Sign Poſt. There uniting all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52615:38"/>
their Force do dreſs her up as
gay as poſſible, and are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
(if it can be) as our
unbounded Fancies. I ſay, if
we ſeriouſly reflect on all this,
we ſhould not find <hi>it</hi> ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
as to make us forget
our greateſt Bleſſings our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to enjoy <hi>it;</hi> nor yet ſo
permanent as to make us hope
for any laſting Pleaſures from <hi>it.</hi>
For when 'tis never ſo natural,
a ſmall fit of <hi>Siokneſs</hi> oft takes
away the ſuperficial part of it,
and a <hi>few years, Children,</hi> and
<hi>Ill Nature</hi> do take away all the
reſt of the varniſhed Features.
Then the hot fit of Paſſion
ſoon turns to the cold one of
loathing; and all thoſe <hi>ſoft Joys</hi>
and <hi>charming Pleaſures,</hi> which
raging and unruly Deſires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to meet withal, dull
<hi>Fruition</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> finds ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52615:39"/>
and nothing left but a
rotten decayed Veſſel, bereft of
all that's good, and emptied
of all its Delights. So that
Young Perſons are under a
very ſtrange miſtake when they
think <hi>Beauty</hi> alone can make
any <hi>Marriage</hi> happy; for this
they may be moſt certain of,
that whatſoever <hi>Love</hi> has no
ſtronger legaments than what
proceed from <hi>thence (beſides</hi>
the Racks of <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies</hi>
which ſo often attend
it) can never laſt any longer
than <hi>that</hi> will; no more than
that Love which is grounded
on <hi>Mony,</hi> can outlaſt the ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other things
beſides <hi>Beauty,</hi> which makes
many a Woman be loved and
admired, and oft cauſe Young
Perſons to tranſgreſs the Duty
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52615:39"/>
they owe to their <hi>Parents;</hi>
as <hi>Good Nature,</hi> a fine <hi>Carriage,</hi>
a <hi>quick Wit,</hi> and a <hi>ſweet Voice:</hi>
and all theſe have each their
peculiar Charms, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
by many men (and
perhaps with juſtice too) as
much as <hi>Beauty</hi> it ſelf. Yet
for all that, when every one
of theſe unite their Power
and Forces, and meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Woman (which
is certainly as ſtrong and
mighty temptation for Youth
to encounter withal) they are
many times misfortunes (when
abſtracted from vertue) rather
than Advantages, and Plagues
rather than Bleſſings, <hi>there</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all to be found in many
a common <hi>Proſtitute,</hi> and in
the very worſt of Women.
Neither indeed can theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
any manner of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52615:40"/>
or real content, when <hi>true
Love, Vertuous Inclinations,</hi> and
a <hi>Competency</hi> are wanting; the
two former being abſolutely
neceſſary to make firm their
Happineſs, and keep it ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually;
and the latter to
gain Friends conſents, and to
crown all their Joys.</p>
            <p>Now what man in his right
wits that has the leaſt grain
of conſideration in him, would
ever be ſo groſly ſilly and
ſenſleſs as to marry a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(though endowed with
all the forementioned Charms)
that he knew for certain did
not really love him, or had
not Vertue or Honour to
continue that Love? Certainly
he can have no manner of
regard to his Quiet and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in this Life, or muſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52615:40"/>
be moſt ſtrangely ignorant of
the means and way to it, who
ſhall thus fooliſhly plunge
himſelf into the midſt of an
Ocean of <hi>Doubts,</hi> which will
be a devouring Torment and
a perpetual Rack to his Mind,
if he has any thing of Life
or Soul in him. Yet he that
marries a Perſon without his
<hi>Parents</hi> conſent, (the want of
an Eſtate being ſuppoſed to
hinder their conſent) though
perhaps he is not abſolutely
certain his Miſtreſs don't love
him, yet he can never be
certain ſhe does, or that ſhe
don't love his <hi>Mony</hi> far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than himſelf, which if he
knows he's doubly mad to
marry her. For when all ſuch
Perſone firſt ſet their hearts
upon <hi>that</hi> (as it is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in this caſe) they mind
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52615:41"/>
little elſe but thoſe ill Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and ridiculous vanities,
that all mean Perſons ſo much
ſeek after; and what is more
uſual than to have <hi>Mercinary
Spirits</hi> ſoon loſe all ſenſe of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity</hi>
or Gratitude?</p>
            <p>Some Perſons are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that if they marry with
them of Inferiour Rank, they
can manage them as they
pleaſe; and do verily believe
that <hi>gratitude</hi> will always be
a ſufficient Obligation to bind
them to all <hi>Affection, Love,
Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> and by
this means they propoſe to
themſelves ſtrange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
the beſt ordered, and
the moſt ingeniouſly invented
that can be for their quiet
and content. But ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52615:41"/>
ought to be put among
the Cautious Sir <hi>Solomons</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,
and be ſure to meet
with no better luck than he;
for this is a vain and fooliſh
ſuppoſition, fit for only the
unthinking part of the World,
and contradicting all common
Experience. For that conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhews us that he that takes
his Maid for his <hi>Conſort,</hi> finds
her no leſs Proud and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
than he that marries
with one of the Higheſt Rank;
nay very oftentimes more; for
all Baſe Bron Inferiour Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(though naturally of a
Diſpoſition good enough) are
ſtrangely changed and altered
by ſuch Honours, as being
ſo much above their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
which makes them have
a vaſt conceit of their own
Worth and Merits, their Pride
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52615:42"/>
and Inſolency encreaſing to
that degree as they become
altogether inſupportable; while
better Educations are far more
noble and generous, being apter
to own Obligations.</p>
            <p>Not to inſiſt too long upon
this Head, nor to be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
on this Subject; in ſhort,
all Young Perſons whatſoever
may obſerve and take this for
a moſt certain and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Truth, that they neither
have nor can have a power
of diſpoſing of themſelves as
they pleaſe, as long as their
<hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi> intruſted
by them are alive, and they
have any manner of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon them; and let
their Inclinations and Deſires
be how they will, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter into ſuch a ſolemn
and ſacred Inſtitution as <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52615:42"/>
of their own accord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their <hi>Parents</hi> conſent; they
being ſo far part of their
Goods (and the cleareſt and
moſt valuable too) that to
give themſelves away unknown
to <hi>them,</hi> is a kind of Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or Theft, or perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worſe. This is a Crime
which they can never anſwer
to God or Good Men; for a
<hi>Marriage</hi> is not real or truly
compleat according to God's
Laws, till <hi>Parents</hi> by their
conſent make firm the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
And this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion of the chief of
our Divines, as far as I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed
Paſſions have wholly
led them away, will pretend
that the ſoft <hi>Allurements,</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52615:43"/>
ſweet <hi>Temptations</hi> of <hi>Beauty,
Good Nature, Wit</hi> and the like,
have been ſo very ſtrong and
powerful, that they have not
been able in any manner to
reſiſt them. I will not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
how Humane Nature
may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to
have power of encountring
<hi>there;</hi> but however this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
will never ſerve, ſince
the venturing to ſtand the
brunt and force of <hi>them,</hi> and
of favouring of <hi>Opportunities,</hi> is
one of their Principal Faults.
For <hi>thoſe</hi> above all things, are
ever to be moſt carefully and
cunningly avoided; and ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as the moſt dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
and like a full neſt
of inraged Hornets, diſturbed
by ſome unwary Traveller,
more to be fled from than
fought withall. Beſides <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52615:43"/>
is a poor pretence that
every common <hi>Proſtitute</hi> makes
uſe of to extenuate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
her filthy Luſts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Perjured Villain to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his Rogueries; and if
this would hold good, the
greateſt Wickedneſs in the
World might go unregarded,
and Crimes of the higheſt
and blackeſt nature go ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Therefore let Children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and dread the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Conſequences of all ſuch
<hi>Matches,</hi> as their own Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and moſt Unruly Deſires
leads them to; whoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are commonly with the
violent and hot flames of
Love, and do ſoon turn to
the ſad and cold fits of Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
By this means it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52615:44"/>
for a Man to have a
tormenting <hi>Wife</hi> that plagues
and hates him, ſtubborn and
rebellious <hi>Children</hi> that deſpiſe
and ſcorn him, an <hi>Eſtate</hi> quite
ſhattered and waſted, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Self upon the very
brink of certain <hi>Ruin,</hi> not
knowing how to avoid or
eſcape it, and all the time
perhaps the hatred and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his unreconciled <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;</hi>
which laſt will always
be as a devouring and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Worm, and a clog of
ſome weight to his diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Soul. For <hi>Diſobedience</hi> (the
Fatal cauſe of their troubles)
is an aſperſion ſo very vile
and ugly, that nothing but
Time and Repentance can
wipe off in this World. And
therefore once more let me
earneſtly deſire and adviſe all
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52615:44"/>
Young Perſons whatſoever to
have a more than ordinary
care of ſuch things, and that
their <hi>Stubborneſs</hi> and <hi>Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
do not pull down <hi>God's</hi>
juſt vengeance, and their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
curſes upon their Head.</p>

            <p>PArents I do not doubt but

with moſt of the Paſſages
of the former Chapter, ſince
that ſpeaks ſo much in behalf

<hi>Childrens Diſobedience;</hi> but
I am afraid they'l ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
this following Chapter,
nor well digeſt a buſineſs
which touches them ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for this treats of the laſt
ſort of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequal Marriages,</hi> in
which they themſelves are the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52615:45"/>
principal Actors and are moſt
guilty, namely of marrying
their Children without their
Conſents, or againſt their
Wills. We may obſerve that
every Perſon is very angry
and uneaſie when he comes
to ſee his own vile Practices
and Vices laid open to the
cenſuring World; but above
all, Old Perſons take it moſt
grievouſly, becauſe their high
conceit of their own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
leads them to believe
themſelves beyond doing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
or at leaſt of deſerving
to be cenſured.</p>
            <p>I am now arrived and juſt
entring upon a moſt ſad and
Malancholly Subject, and I
cannot but beſtow a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reflections and ſome
mournful thoughts upon it;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52615:46"/>
a Subject that many are apt
to ſtart at, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſo much as to hear it
once mentioned, having expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
found the ſad and
fatal Effects of it, either in
themſelves or their Relations.
And this is a <hi>Curſe</hi> that mean
and Inferiour Perſons are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never liable to, and
are but very rarely troubled
with the Misfotunes that ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attend it. But <hi>this</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
frequently accompanies the
Gaudy Pomps and Airy Noiſe
of <hi>Magnificence, Grandure</hi> and
<hi>Riches,</hi> ſtill aiming and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at great and lofty Places,
whilſt little ones commonly
eſcape free; like the ordinary
and common Diſeaſes which
proceed from Luxury, being
ſtarved at Cottages do always
ſhun them, and inhabit Courts
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52615:46"/>
and Palaces. So that this is a
thing that lights more upon
the heads of Great Perſons
Children than others, and that
too upon the <hi>Female Sex</hi> more
commonly than the <hi>Male.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the greatneſs of this
Injury, there's nothing more
apparent; being ſuch, that all
the pains and cares that a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
is able to take or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
for a <hi>Child</hi> in this ſad
caſe, can never make amends,
or give any reaſonable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the Misfortune being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſo large and compleat,
that it is beyond the Power
of Man to relieve, or give
eaſe to: Tho a <hi>Married Life</hi>
is very often found to be the
happieſt and moſt comfortable
of all others; yet when it
comes to begin thus diſmally,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52615:47"/>
it moſtly proves the worſt of
all conditions whatſoever, and
is very often one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Plagues that can well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
a Man, making their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
more ſad and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than the pooreſt Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
who beg bread from
door to door: and this may
be confirmed ſufficiently by
too many lamentable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Examples of this kind.
So that a Wiſe and Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man (eſpecially if he
comes to conſider the great
ſins that conſtantly attend it)
would ſooner chooſe the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
and meaneſt <hi>Imployments,</hi>
and moſt contemptible of all
<hi>callings,</hi> than endure thoſe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Tortures, that ſo neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to all ſuch Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Matches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52615:47"/>
For a <hi>Parent</hi> to bring up
his <hi>Child</hi> with all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
tenderneſs and care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
to be always ready
to inſtruct him in every good
and vertuous Exerciſe; to be
moſt exact in teaching him
all the excellent and noble
Accompliſhments which his
<hi>Condition, Eſtate</hi> and <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
ſo much deſerve; to
ſuffer him in, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him all the moderate
and Innocent Pleaſures and
Recreations that may be had;
and to indulge him and
love him as his own Soul,
is a thing tho frequently yet
very commendable, and is
ſomething that will bind a
generous Diſpoſition far ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Obligations that
proceed from <hi>Power, Fear</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52615:48"/>
conſtrained <hi>Obedience.</hi> But then
for ſuch a <hi>Parent</hi> by his over
violent zeal, and too eager
deſire after his <hi>Sons</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by an unlucky blow to
ruin him at once beyond all
relief, is a thing moſt ſtrange,
unaccountable and prodigious.
I am extreamly ſorry that I
can truly ſay, 'tis a thing that
has been often done and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed;
and that too by ſuch
<hi>Parents,</hi> whoſe good <hi>Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Gravity, Prudence</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,</hi>
would have ſpoke far
better things for them, and
(one would have thought)
might have taught them more
<hi>Vertue, Piety</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> or
at leaſt more <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
than out of a fooliſh
Humour, ſcarce worthy of
ſuch a care, to imbitter their
Childrens Happineſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52615:48"/>
Miſery upon their Fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
for ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>When I come to conſider
the ſtrange cares and troubles
that <hi>Parents</hi> have for their
<hi>Childrens</hi> ſake, 'tis then, and
only then, that I am ready
to think almoſt all <hi>Marriages</hi>
unhappy and unfortunate: but
on the other ſide when I
look upon the ſweet comforts
and pleaſant ſatisfaction they
receive from their good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and their hopes they
feed themſelves withal of their
proving well, when they ſee
nothing to the contrary; I find
thoſe are Engines ſtrong and
powerful enough to hold them
up, and to keep them from
ſinking under a load of cares
and concerns. <hi>Parents</hi> Lives are
often like thoſe of <hi>Poets</hi> and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52615:49"/>
               <hi>Gameſters,</hi> who can very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arrive to the pleaſure of
being cool and at reſt; their
buſie Souls and overwhelm'd
Deſires are continually in flame,
which never ſuffers them to
have a calm and even tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but makes them always
either in Raptures or Diſpair,
according as their good or bad
Fortune requires it. 'Tis their
overdoing of things which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ruins their Deſigns, and
breaks all their meaſures; <hi>their</hi>
exceſs of <hi>Love</hi> makes their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
bold, impudent and ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
their overmuch <hi>Care</hi> and
deſire for them, makes them
idle, careleſs and undutiful;
the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> makes them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful,
diſdainful and to
hate and ſlight their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and their <hi>Rigidneſs</hi>
cramps and deſtroys all their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52615:49"/>
generous thoughts, and corrupts
the Morals. Yet they think
many times they can mould
them as they pleaſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
their minds as they think
fit; and becauſe they ſuppoſe
their <hi>Children do not know what
is good for themſelves,</hi> their
threats muſt drive them to it,
which deſtroys the very eſſence
and nature of <hi>Good</hi> of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and when they have once
got them coupled to an <hi>Eſtate</hi>
and a few <hi>Titles,</hi> they think
they have done all; tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they have undone all,
and ruined them to all intents
and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>That no man might think
that I have ſaid any thing
out of Ill Will or Prejudice,
I do freely and ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that I have ſo good
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52615:50"/>
an Opinion of all <hi>Parents,</hi> and
particularly of theſe ſorts I am
treating of, that I cannot ſo
much as ſuppoſe any of them
to deſire, or heartily wiſh their
<hi>Children</hi> the leaſt Hurt or Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
much leſs their laſting
Miſery or Ruin; (tho we find
ſeveral upon the account of
Faults and Diſobedience, to
have put extraordinary ill things
upon their <hi>Children,</hi> and ſuch
as they themſelves muſt needs
know to be hard and cruel)
But when I go about to aquit
them of this Vice, I muſt of
neceſſity accuſe them of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
piece of Folly (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a horrible Sin which I
ſhall mention to them by and
by) when they think to make
that <hi>Match</hi> happy which begins
with hatred and loathing; and
this is a ridiculous thing which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52615:50"/>
men of their Age and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
can never be ſuppoſed
to be ignorant of. They may
as well hope to ſee the Poles
of the Heavens meet, or make
Fire and Water agree, as the
Loves, Inclinations and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of ſome Perſons. Young
Peoples Humours and Paſſions
are very often ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable,
and ſuch as are
impoſſible to unite; and <hi>Fathers</hi>
are not to imagine that their
<hi>Children</hi> are like Trees, in
which they can graft different
Humours and Inclinations, as
well as different Fruits.</p>
            <p>But ſome <hi>Parents,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to perceive and reflect
upon the miſerable and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Effects of the hard and
ſevere Uſage, their Pity flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a-pace, do ſtill flatter
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52615:51"/>
themſelves with the hopes that
<hi>time</hi> ſhould eaſe them, and
help to ſet all to rights again.
And this is the common and
threadbare Pretence that all
<hi>Parents</hi> make uſe of to excuſe
their Severity and Injuſtice;
for, ſay they, <hi>tho the Wound be
wide and troubleſom, yet the Cure
is not very hard; time and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Blood, with a little care,
will make all well again.</hi> But ſad
Experience confutes this, and
ſhews it to be altogether falſe
and frivolous; for we conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find that length of <hi>times</hi>
and <hi>days</hi> do very rarely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any ſort of cure for this
Diſtemper (as it has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hoped for) but for the
moſt part rather encreaſing the
Torment; for theſe Wounds
are like the breaches of Ships
and Veſſels which time only
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52615:51"/>
makes wider, but can never
ſtop up; which as the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and common Diſeaſes of
<hi>Old Age</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> growing
worſe and worſe, till kind
Death comes and puts an end
to all. Only ſometimes we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
of an Ingenious Pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who has got the <hi>Stoical</hi>
knack of ſlighting all troubles
and caring for nothing, and
to eaſe himſelf in this caſe will
be ſure to cauſe his Wives
<hi>Money</hi> to gingle, make havock
on her <hi>Caſh,</hi> and the Yellow
Boys fly merrily about like
dirt, in his Cups once ran
home to beſtow three or four
or half a dozen genteel curſes
upon his kind hearted <hi>Parents</hi>
by way of thanks; and briskly
and finely paſs away his time
among the honourable Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of <hi>Chimney Sweepers</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52615:52"/>
As for <hi>Emperors, Kings</hi> and
ſuch kind of Perſons as thoſe,
I ſhall not dare to preſume to
meddle withall, or concern
my ſelf in this caſe; nor will
I venture to determine any
thing in the Myſterious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State: But to all others
I muſt take the boldneſs to
tell them that this is a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Offence, and piece of
Wickedneſs, that can never
be let paſs unregarded. They
indeed may make the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
joyn their hands, but the
<hi>Marriage</hi> can never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
or lawful till their hearts
be joyned too; this being a
moſt perfect violation of their
Native <hi>Freedom,</hi> and to be
forced this way is the worſt
and moſt miſerable of all ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.
Neither can theſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:52615:52"/>
any ways acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of making their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
guilty of two mortal and
moſt abominable Sins, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> and
thoſe of the baſeſt and blackeſt
Die too. For let any man
ſeriouſly conſider and ſee if
they can find or imagine a
greater and groſſer <hi>Perjury,</hi>
than to make the moſt ſacred
and moſt ſolemn <hi>Vow</hi> that can
be thought of, in the aweful
preſence of <hi>God</hi> and the whole
<hi>Congregation,</hi> to a thing that
is abſolutely falſe? Or indeed
how can there be a baſer
piece of <hi>Treachery,</hi> than to
make ſuch a ſolemn <hi>Vow,</hi> when
they neither can or will keep
it; and in a concern upon which
ſo nearly depends all that's
good and happy in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52615:53"/>
For my part, when I come
to conſider the greatneſs of
theſe Crimes, I can but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and am amazed at the
very thoughts of ſuch Monſ;trous
Impieties as theſe; and
can but ſtrangely wonder how
either <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> dare
ſo much as appear in ſuch
a horrid Buſineſs, and are
not afraid of the <hi>Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi>
in the very Act. For
certain Experience ſhews us,
that things done with ſo much
<hi>Precaution, Conſideration</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,</hi>
always ſtrike a moſt
ſad and deep terror in mens
hearts, more than ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
practiſed, though never
ſo great and heinous. This
moſt ſacred Order of <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
is not to be plaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
paſſed ſlightly over, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52615:53"/>
made a common property for
<hi>Private Intereſt,</hi> but there ought
to be a wonderful deal of
Caution and Care in it. And
when a <hi>Match</hi> begins with
two ſuch ſhameful Crimes as
theſe; 'tis no wonder at all
if the <hi>Almighty</hi> ſends his Plagues
upon their heads, puniſhing
<hi>Parents</hi> in beholding their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens</hi>
Miſeries, and <hi>Children</hi> in
feeling the deadly effects of
their own <hi>Perjuries:</hi> nor is it
ſtrange if the Devil be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to ſow his curſed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions
among them, and
keeping them at ſuch a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that nothing can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be expected but Deſpair
and Deſolation.</p>
            <p>Now a main and Principal
Cauſe of all theſe troubles and
diſturbances, and that makes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52615:54"/>
Old Men ſo raging mad and
deſperately hot, is <hi>Mony;</hi> a
thing which always command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ruled and governed the
more degenerate and baſer part
of the World as it pleaſed,
bringing them wholly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to its own Devotion,
and making them hazard all
Troubles and Dangers, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Reputations, and
their very Bodies and Souls;
and all in hopes of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Favours from, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Bright Beauty.</hi> This
'tis that caſts ſuch a deadly
miſt, and blinds <hi>Parents</hi> Eyes,
perverts their Reaſons, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
their Underſtandings ſo
much, that all Great and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Thoughts, all Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Noble Deſigns are
clog'd, pul'd down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
ſo that by this means
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52615:54"/>
they become ſo ſordid and dull,
as they cannot diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the beſt and worſt things.
'Tis for <hi>this</hi> that many a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
toyls and torments him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
racks and diſturbs his
Plotting Brains, for a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
ungracious <hi>Son,</hi> who won't
ſo much as beſtow upon him
the ordinary Complement of
Thanks, but will ſpend and
and make it fly faſter than
ever they got it. <hi>This</hi> is ſo
ſweet and pleaſant, that the
moſt ridged <hi>Quaker,</hi> and moſt
preſiſe <hi>Puritan,</hi> who will ſcarce
permit or endure the moſt
common and innocent <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
yet they ſhall finely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
and ſolace themſelves
with <hi>this,</hi> and hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
over their full Bags,
whilſt Beggars may ſtarve in the
ſtreets for all any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52615:55"/>
               <hi>Parents</hi> do ſtrangely pleaſe
themſelves with theſe hopes,
and are continually endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to imprint their infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Notions into their <hi>Children</hi>
when they are young, telling
them what ſtrange things they
may expect from a good <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
ſo that they may make
it their chief Buſineſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; for they themſelves
believe there is no Happineſs
equal to a large <hi>Eſtate,</hi> nor
no pleaſure like the ſight of
a huge heap of <hi>Guinea's;</hi> ſo
that if they can but obtain
<hi>this</hi> for their <hi>Children,</hi> they
think their own and their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
is perfectly compleat.
But this a vain and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
conceit, which whole
Multitudes pleaſe themſelves
withall; for <hi>Riches,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the many ſlaviſh cares
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52615:55"/>
and troubles that ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attend them, are far ſhort
of that value that their gay
and glittering appearance makes
them ſeem to be. And in
truth they are but <hi>Baubles</hi> and

and a true <hi>Contented
Soul;</hi> neither will all the Gold

of real Satisfaction to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
and diſturbed Mind;
but will rather ſerve as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Clog to his dejected Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to plunge him the deeper
into a Sea of Sorrows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is a very ſtrange
and inconſiſtant thing, and
(as a very Ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
obſerves) ſeems not ſo
much a Vice as a <hi>deplorable
piece of Madneſs;</hi> ſo that I can
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52615:56"/>
reckon it nothing but a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Diſeaſe and plague
which is peculiar to ſome ſort
of Conſtitutions; and is more
Contagious and Epidemical in
Old Perſons than the Gout,
Stone, or Palſie, and very
often a far greater Torment
than any of them. In the
ſpending <hi>Mony,</hi> I grant there
may be ſeveral ſorts of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
but in the hoarding of
it up, and keeping it under
Lock and Key, (and very
often for they know not whom)
and making no uſe <hi>on't</hi> at all;
for the pleaſure of that, I own
it goes beyond my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to imagine, unleſs it be
in weighing and telling of <hi>it,</hi>
and then I reckon that pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Straws and catching of
Flys are far more noble and
innocent Recreations. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52615:56"/>
has been always obſerved,
that all ſuch Perſons who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and love it moſt of all,
and hug and graſp it cloſeſt,
do conſtantly make the leaſt
uſe of it, and find ſmalleſt
comfort and ſatisfaction by it.
As for the Pleaſures and Joys
that belong to much <hi>Riches,</hi>
they are always more imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
than real, and the <hi>Eaſe</hi>
that ſo many expect in the
enjoyment of <hi>Mony</hi> is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found to be the moſt falſe
and Chimerical of all things. And
he that eagerly perſues and
thirſts after abundance of <hi>Mony,</hi>
only with that expectation of
living a <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndiſturbed
Life,</hi> is as ridiculouſly ſilly as
he that hid himſelf in the

ſhower of Rain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:52615:57"/>
For my part whenſoever I
carefully reflect upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſad <hi>Diſquiets, Noyſes, Envys</hi>
and <hi>Genſures</hi> that ſo conſtantly
attend <hi>Grandeur</hi> and <hi>Riches;</hi> I
can but admire that they ſhould
be ſo hotly ſought after; and
alſo can but heartily pity the
ſad and mournful conditions
of many excellent Young <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
who only for the ſake
of their <hi>Quality, Greatneſs</hi> and
<hi>Fortunes,</hi> are forced and driven
by the dreadful fears of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Ruin, to do that which
is directly contrary to their
Natures, and which their Souls
moſt abhor; and that too by
baſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles</hi> and mercinary
<hi>Guardians</hi> (oftentimes the worſt
of all People) as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
themſelves. On the other
ſide I can but almoſt envy the
quiet and moſt happy ſtate of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52615:57"/>
many Inferiour Perſons, whoſe
<hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> are ſo
ſmall, as never to prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to their <hi>Eaſe,</hi> or be made
a trap to their Ruins; and can
bleſs themſelves with the ſweet
ſatisfaction of Liberty, and
with perfect Freedom of Choice,
being truly happy in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Loves and Affections, not
teas'd and troubled with thoſe
baſe and contagious Noiſe of
<hi>Sueing for Portions, Tenants Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
Creditor-Duns, Neighbours
Quarrels,</hi> &amp;c. nor plagued with
the naucious Impertinence of
a whole Covy of griping <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi>
and mercileſs <hi>Atornys,</hi> and
a Houſe full of Writings at
every Match.</p>
            <p>There is one moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
piece of <hi>Folly</hi> that I have
often obſerved in ſeveral <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:52615:58"/>
which apparently ſhews
that <hi>Mony</hi> has turned and made
their Brains ſo muddy, that
they are not <hi>right,</hi> that is, they
will never conſider of, nor
ſuffer any thing, tho never
ſo eſtimable and valuable to
ſtand in competition with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
no not ſo much as to
make the Scale even. So that
by this means none of thoſe
noble <hi>Acquiſitions,</hi> and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Accompliſhments</hi> as <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Education, Nobility, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
Vertue, Good Nature,</hi>
and the like, ſhall ever be
eſteemed of or thought of

the mean time <hi>theſe</hi>
ſhall crouch beneath its Feet,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52615:58"/>
and be content to go in Rags.
This is a piece of <hi>Folly</hi> that
one would think People of

not be guilty of, being of that
Age, as can never be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

and ſo impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cautious it ſeems ſome are,
that after their Deaths, the

the moſt <hi>Dull, Illiterate Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
the moſt <hi>Sordid Senſleſs

when at the ſame time

be caſt off, and not look'd

but that poor and pitiful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>that his Eſtate was but
half ſo large as the others.</hi> Now
let any Perſon of Common

if theſe be not pitiful Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
<hi>Follies,</hi> beneath any Man

            </p>
            <p>There is another Humour
I have obſerved in ſome <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
which has the ſtrongeſt
tincture of <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
that is, they ſhall uſe
their utmoſt Power, and be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52615:60"/>
ſtrangely careful to put off a

that has but an <hi>Eſtate</hi>
bigger in Proportion than
what ſhe's like to have, tho
it be never ſo much contrary
to his <hi>Parents</hi> conſent; and
then at laſt perhaps find ſome
fooliſh quibble and ridiculous
pretence to fob her off with
a few gay Promiſes, and give
her nothing at all, eſpecially
whilſt he is alive. It would
certainly make a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Farce but to take notice
of and obſerve the many grave
<hi>Inſtructions,</hi> cunning <hi>Ways</hi> and
ſly <hi>Tricks,</hi> ſuch a Parent makes
uſe of to obtain his ends;
how wonderfully careful and
exact he is in teaching his
Daughter her Leſſon, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
civil he is to the
young raw <hi>Gallant,</hi> and how
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52615:60"/>
large and weighty are his
Promiſes, till he once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Gudgeon well hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
then but to ſee how ſlily
the Old Fox gives them the
ſlip, leaves them both in the
lurtch, and marches off as
gravely with an idle Flam to
his <hi>Father</hi> as if he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch a Fellow as this
will never endure to hear of

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52615:61"/>
               <hi>thou look'ſt like a good honeſt

won't allow me any good Cloaths,

and how ſhall I go to work

(crys the Old Miſer) <hi>times
are very hard, and Mony is
ſtrangely ſcarce; you ſhould learn
to be a good Husband</hi> Tom; <hi>I
ſave it all for thee Boy. But
however ſince I have one in my

Boy?</hi> Upon this perhaps <hi>Tom</hi>
gets new Cloaths, and he and
his old Father fall to work
upon ſome young Creature
much above his <hi>Fortune,</hi> and
perhaps gets her and marrys
her to the great Grief of all
her Relations. But if Matters
ſhould chance to come to the
Pinch, and to the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
that may poſſibly be
in this caſe; Old <hi>Jack</hi> will
be ſure to find a trick to ſlip
his own Neck out of the Nooſe,
and leave poor <hi>Tom</hi> fairly to
hang for't.</p>
            <p>Now are not theſe and the
like things very groſs pieces
of <hi>partiality</hi> and <hi>injuſtice?</hi> Yet
We frequently find thoſe very
<hi>Parents</hi> who are ſo very hot
and violent in exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52615:62"/>
of <hi>Children</hi> that marry
without their <hi>Parents</hi> conſent;
thoſe Perſons we often find to
be moſt ready to tranſgreſs it
themſelves in the Perſons of
others (and that on the baſeſt
manner too) when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is for the advantage
of the <hi>Family.</hi> And all their
railings and bitter exclaimings
againſt this <hi>Vice,</hi> is only a right
down <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Cheat,</hi> a pure
piece of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> to ſcare
their own <hi>Children,</hi> and fright
them into Obedience. This
is the Nature and Diſpoſition
of a great many <hi>Parents</hi> (tho
not all on ſuch groſs a manner)
and (that which is more ſtrange
too) even of ſuch as have
very <hi>Prudent, Grave, Diſcreet,
Ingenious Gentlemen;</hi> and ſuch
too as have had all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of <hi>Generous</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52615:62"/>
Perſons.</hi> But how much
theſe things can agree with,
or be any ways conſiſtant
with ſuch <hi>Mean, Sordid, Baſe</hi>
and <hi>Ignoble Actions,</hi> I ſhall leave
to the Candor and Judgment
of any <hi>Impartial</hi> and Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
Man whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with a
few words of Friendly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Firſt for <hi>Old Perſons</hi> who
are on the other ſide Sixty, I
would adviſe them not to
marry at all, but rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themſelves on the thoughts
of the other World (for they
know they can have but a
ſhort time to ſtay in this) and
in inſtructing and doing good
to others; and this will be the
only ſure way to get true
Honour and ſatisfaction. But
if they muſt trouble themſelves
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52615:63"/>
with the thoughts of <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
(which upon ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
may be reaſonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
too) let them pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome Grave and Pious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi>
ſutable to their Years
and Fortunes, by which means
they may prove mutual Helps
and great Comforts to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not ſet their minds
upon young Wild <hi>Creatures,</hi>
who will be to hard for them
every way, cauſe them to be
made common Laughing-ſtocks
to the enquiring World, plague
and diſturb all their <hi>Quiet</hi> and
<hi>Eaſe,</hi> and help to ſend them to
their Graves long before their
times.</p>
            <p>Next for <hi>Children,</hi> ſince they
have not a Power of diſpoſing
of themſelves as they think
fit; and ſince ſuch ſad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52615:63"/>
Effects do often follow
from their making uſe of ſuch
a Power, let them not dare to
venture upon this Sacred Order
of <hi>Matrimony</hi> without their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
conſent; but let them have
a ſtrict and more than ordinary
care to avoid all <hi>Temptations</hi> till
they have leave, as they would
a moſt deadly Precipice. But
for the <hi>Young Perſons</hi> that have
a larger power of diſpoſing of
themſelves, 'twill be the higheſt
piece of <hi>Folly</hi> to marry one that
is much beneath them (except
there be ſome extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
beſides <hi>Beauty)</hi> for he
can never be ſure of her <hi>Love,</hi>
the very Life and Soul of all
their Hopes and Comports. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I have any Perſons
aim at thoſe that are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their <hi>Rank</hi> (a Paradox in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen
to a great many People)
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52615:64"/>
for then the mind is often ſo
horridly corrupted with baſe
and ungenerous Deſires, that
the danger and ill conſequences
are much the other way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> For <hi>Parents</hi> and the
like, let them ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great Account they muſt
give at the laſt day for many of
their <hi>Childrens</hi> Failings, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thoſe woful Misfortunes they
have brought upon them by
their own means, and with the
heynous ſins of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;</hi>
therefore let them dread
the very thoughts of all ſuch
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Matches.</hi> For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
let them not be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ambitious of marrying
their <hi>Children</hi> above their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi>
but however they ought
to take care to have them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
in time, leaſt they prove
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52615:64"/>
               <hi>Diſhoneſt, Stubborn</hi> and <hi>Irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
On the other ſide, let them
not diſdain to marry them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their <hi>Rank,</hi> nor ſtand too
much upon <hi>Smithfield Bargains</hi>
when they have a <hi>Competency</hi>
themſelves, and they find a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Vertuous Perſon,</hi> whoſe <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Ingenuity</hi> and other good
Properties will make amends for
<hi>Mony</hi> and all other inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Trifles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I quite conclude all, I
muſt adviſe every Perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
let 'em be <hi>Young</hi> or <hi>Old, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
or <hi>Children,</hi> to have a peculiar
care of Marrying to any of <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Religions;</hi> for notwithſtanding
there be <hi>Content</hi> on all ſides, <hi>Love,
Mony, Good Inclinations,</hi> &amp;c. this
one thing is enough to ruine all,
deſtroy all their Pleaſures, and
may make it the deareſt piece of
