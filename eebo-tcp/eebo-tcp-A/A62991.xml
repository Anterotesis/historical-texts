            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving perused several of our Histories of <hi>England;</hi> and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amazed to find in them, That the Alteration of Religion here hath been totally carried on by worldly Interest, I thought it would not be ungrateful to the Reader, to have those various Passages, concerning the Changes of Religion, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected together out of those Histories; for the informing him exactly, how those Changes have been made: And withal of the Beginning, and Progress of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in this Nation; and the Ground of Multiplying other Sects, which hath been the cause of all our late Confusions.</p>
            <p>I have laboured to connect these Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges together, in as good an order, as I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56964:3"/>
think, could be expected in matters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of such large volumns.</p>
            <p>Much more might have been Collected, concerning these matters, out of diverse other Histories: But I think, the chief matters are here sufficiently handled; which may satisfie the curiosity of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader.</p>
            <p>To add more Authority to what shall be here taken out of Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Reformation,</hi> (from whence the chiefest matters of these Collections are gathered) I will here Insert a Passage out of the Preface of it; by which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what diligence he hath used in composing this History. The words of the Preface are these.</p>

IN this following History you will find more to satisfie your curiosity, and inform your judgment, then can be possibly drawn up in this general view. As for my performance in this work, In the first place I am to tell you, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the raising of this Fabrick I have not borrowed my materials, only out of vulgar Authors but searched into the Records of the Convocation; consulted all such Acts of Parliament, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned my purpose; advised with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forein Writers, of great name and credit, exemplified some Records, and Charters of no common quality (many rare pieces in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) and not a few Debates and Orders of the Council-Table: which I have laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in as good a form, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it, with a trimming as agreeable, as my hands could give it.</p>

            <p>FIrst King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for writing a Book against <hi>Luther,</hi> received a Bull from the Pope, whereby he had the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given him to be <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> for him and his Successors for ever.</p>
            <p>The Relation concerning which Book and the Reception of it by the Pope, is thus set down in the History of the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> pag. 104.</p>

Hereupon the King compiles a Book; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he strenuously opposed <hi>Luther,</hi> in the point of <hi>Indulgences, Number of Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi> and other particulars, to be seen in that his work, Entitled <hi>(de Septem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentis, &amp;c.)</hi> a principal Copy whereof, richly bound, being sent to <hi>Leo,</hi> I remember my self to have seen in the <hi>Vatican Library.</hi> The manner of the delivery whereof (as I find it in our Records) was thus.</p>
                        <p>Doctor <hi>John Clark,</hi> Dean of <hi>Windsor</hi> our Kings Embassador, appearing in full <hi>Consistory;</hi> the Pope (knowing the glorious Present he brought) first gave him his cheek to kiss, and then, (receiving the Book) promised to do so much, for the Approbation thereof, as ever was done for St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> or St. <hi>Hierome's</hi> Works: Assuring him withal, that the next Consistory, he would bestow a publick Title on our King: which having been heretofore privately debated among the Cardinals; those of <hi>Protector, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensor Romanae Ecclesiae,</hi> or <hi>Sedis Apostolicae,</hi> or <hi>Rex Apostolicus,</hi> or <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> produced, they at last agreed on, <hi>Defensor Fidei:</hi> a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript of which Bull (out of an Original, <hi>sub plumbo,</hi> in our Records) I have here inserted.</p>

                              <hi>Leo,</hi> Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God, to his most dear Son, <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England, Defender of the Faith,</hi> All health and happiness.

of the whole Church, We bend all Our thoughts, to promote the Catholick Faith; (without which none can be saved) and labour by all means, (as belongs to Our duty) to make use of, and promote all such helps, as have been wisely ordained, for the preserving; the integrity of Christian Faith, amongst all; but most especially amongst Princes, and to suppress the endeavours of those who labour to corrupt it by lies, and false Doctrines. And, as other Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> our Predecessors, have been accustomed to confer special favours upon Catholick Princes, according to the exigency of Times, and Affairs: Especially, upon such, as have not only remained unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their Obedience to the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church; with an entire Faith, and servent Devotion, in the tempestuous times and raging perfidious fury of Schismaticks, and Hereticks; But likewise, as legitimate Children, and stout Champions of the same Church, have opposed themselves, both <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally</hi> and <hi>spiritually,</hi> against the mad fury of such Schismaticks and Hereticks, as have opposed it: So we also desire to extol your Majesty with condign, and immortal Praises, for your excellent, and immortal works and actions, in favour of Us, and this Holy See; (where, by Gods permission, we are establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and to grant you those things which may enable, and engage you to have a care, to

preserve our Lords Flock, from Wolves, and to cut off, with the material Sword, <hi>rotten members</hi> that seek to infect the mystical Body of Christ; confirming in the solidity of Faith, the Hearts of such as waver, or are in danger of falling,</p>

perused the same Book; and finding it to contain admirable Doctrine, and full of the Spirit of God, do give God infinite thanks (from whom proceeds <hi>every good and perfect Gift)</hi> for having thus inspir'd your mind, and enabled you by his Grace, to compose this Work for the defence of his holy Faith against this raiser up of old condemned Errors, and to the inviting of other Kings and Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to follow your example in protecting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith, and Evangelical Truth, now expos'd to great danger, and many oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                           <p>We, upon this, likewise judging it just and reasonable to confer all Honour and Praises up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such as have employ'd their pious Labours, in the defence of the said Christian Faith; do not only extol and magnifie, approve and confirm by Our Authority, what your Majesty hath (with so much solid Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) written against the same <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> but do likewise confer upon your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, such a Title of Honour, that by it, all the Faithful may understand, both now, and for all future times, how grateful and acceptable, this your Majesties Gift hath been unto Us; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially offered at this time.

this Power: Beseeching the Almighty (who said, <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes command,</hi> and in whose Hands <hi>the Hearts of all Kings are)</hi> that he will confirm you in this holy Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and encrease your Devotion, and make your Actions (for the preservation of Faith) so illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious throughout the whole World: That no Man may have occasion to judge, that this Title is confer'd upon you in vain.

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                           <p>IN what have I offended you? or what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of displeasure have I given you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thus to put me from you? I take God to be my Judge, I have been to you a true and humble Wife, ever conformable to your Will, and Pleasure; never contradicting, or gain-saying you in any thing: being always contented with all things, wherein you had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56964:8"/>
any delight, or took any pleasure, without grudge, or countenance of discontent, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. I lov'd for your sake, all them whom you lov'd, whether I had cause, or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were my Friends or my Enemies. I have been your Wife these twenty years or more, and you had by me divers Children; and when you had me at first, I take God to be my Judg, that I was a Maid: and whether it be true, or no, I put it to your own Conscience. If there be any just cause that you can alledge against me, either of dishonesty, or matter lawful to put me from you, I am content to depart, to my shame and confusion: and if there be none, then I pray you to let me have Justice at your Hands. The King, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was, in his time, of such an excellent Wit, that he was accounted amongst all men, for Wisdom, to be <hi>a second Salomon:</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> my Father <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> was accounted one of the wisest Princes, that had reign'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> for many years. It is not, therefore, to be doubted, but that they had gathered as wise Counsellors unto them, of every Realm, as to their Wisdoms they thought meet: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there were in those days, as wise and well-learned men, in both the Realms, as be now at this day: who thought the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you, and me, good and lawful. Therefore it is a wonder to me, what <hi>new inventions</hi> are now <hi>invented</hi> against me. And now to put me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56964:9"/>
to stand to the <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of this Court, seems very unreasonable. For you may condemn me for want of being able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for my self; as having no Counse, but such as you assigned me; who cannot be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent on my part, since they are your own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and such as you have taken, and chosen out of your own Council; whereunto they are privy, and dare not disclose your <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> Therefore I humbly pray you, to spare me, until I may know, what Counsel, my Friends in <hi>Spain</hi> will advise me to take: And if you will not, then your Pleasure be fulfilled.</p>
                           <p>And, with that, she rose up, and departed, never more appearing in any Court.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The King, perceiving that she was <note place="margin">[Stow, p. 543.]</note> gone, said;</p>
               <q>I <hi>Will now in her Absence declare this unto you all, That She has been unto me as True and Obedient a Wife, as I would wish, or desire. She has all the virtuous qualities, that ought to be in a Woman of her Dignity, or in any other of Mean Condition. She is also, surely, a Noble Woman born: Her Condition will well declare it.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56964:9"/>After this, the King sent the Two <note place="margin">[Stow, <hi>p.</hi> 543.]</note> Cardinals, <hi>Campeius,</hi> and <hi>Wolsey,</hi> to speak with her.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>WHen the Queen was told, that the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> were come to speak with Her, She rose up, and, with a Skein of white Thred about her neck, came into her <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi> The <hi>Cardinals</hi> said, they were sent by the King to understand her mind, concerning the business between Him and Her. <q>My Lords, <hi>(saith the Queen)</hi> I cannot answer you so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; for I was set, among my Maids, at work, little thinking of any such matter; wherein there needs a longer deliberation, and a better head, then mine, to make Answer. For I have need of Counsel in this case, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me so near: and for any Counsel, or Friends, that I can find in <hi>England,</hi> they are not for my Profit. For it is not likely, that any English man will Counsel me, or be a Friend to me against the King's Pleasure, since they are his Subjects: And for my Counsel, in which I may trust, they are in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinals returning to the King, gave him an account of what She said. Thus the case went forward, from Court to Court, till it came to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The King's Counsel at the Bar called for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56964:10"/>
Judgment: unto whom <hi>Cardinal Campeius</hi> said thus. <q>
                        <hi>I will not give Judgment, till I have made relation to the Pope of all our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whose Counsel, and Command, I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. The matter is too high for us, to give an hasty Judgment, considering the Highness of the Persons, and doubtfulness of the Case; and also whose Commissioners we be; under whose Authority we sit. It were therefore reason, that we should make our Chief Head a Counsel in the same, before we proceed to a definitive sentence. I come not to please, for Favour, Need, or Dread, of any Person alive, be he King, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. I have no such respect to the Person, that I will offend my Conscience. I will not for the Favour, or Disfavour, of any High Estate, do that thing, which shall be against the Will of God.</hi> I am an old man, (both weak and sickly) that look daily for death. I will not wade any further in this matter, until I have the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Assent of the Pope. Wherefore I will adjourn the Court for this time, according to the Order of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> from whence such Jurisdiction is deriv'd.</q> Upon this the Court was dissolv'd, and no more done.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then step'd forth the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> from the King, and uttered with an haughty Countenance, these words, <note place="margin">[Stow, p. 544.]</note>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>It was</hi> never merry in <hi>ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,</hi> since we had any Cardinals amongst us.<bibl>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56964:10"/>
                  <hi>Upon this there was a Debate held in Council, Whether it were convenient for the King to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to himself the</hi> Supremacy <hi>in</hi> Ecclesiastical Affairs? <hi>In opposition to which there was this</hi> Speech <hi>made; related in my Lord</hi> Herbert'<hi>s History,</hi> pag. 362.</p>

                           <p>YOur Highness is come to a point, which needs a strong, and firm Resolution; it being, not only the most important in its self, that can be presented; but likewise of that consequence, that it will comprehend your Kingdom, and Posterity. It is, whether in this business of your <hi>Divorce,</hi> and <hi>Second Marriage,</hi> as well as in all other Ecclesiastical Affairs, in your Dominions, you would make use of your own, or the Popes Authority. <hi rend="margQuotes">For my own part, as an <hi>Englishman,</hi> and your Highnes's Subject, I must wish all Power in your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But when I consider the Ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Kingdom, I cannot but think any Innovation dangerous. For, if in every Temporal Estate, it be necessary to come to some Supream Authority, whence all inferior Magistracy should be derived; it seems much more necessary in Religion; both, as the Body thereof seems more susceptible of a Head, than any else; and, as that Head again, must direct so many others; We should therefore, above
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56964:11"/>
all things, labour to keep an unity in the parts thereof; as being the Sacred bond, which knits and holds together, not its own alone, but all other Government. But how much, Sir, should we recede from the Dignity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if we (at once) retrenched this its chief and most eminent part? And, who ever liked that Body long, whose Head was taken away? Certainly, Sir, an Authority received for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, ought not rashly to be rejected. For, is not the Pope, <hi>Communis Pater,</hi> in the Christian World, and <hi>Arbiter</hi> of their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences? Does not he Support the Majesty of Religion, and vindicate it from neglect? Does not the holding his Authority from God, keep Men in awe, not of <hi>Temporal</hi> alone, but <hi>Eternal</hi> punishments; and therein extend his Power beyond death it self? And will it be secure, to lay aside those potent means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing People to their Duty, and trust only to the <hi>Sword</hi> of Justice, and <hi>Secular</hi> Arms? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, who shall mitigate the rigor of Laws in those Cases, which may admit exception, if the Pope be taken away? Who shall presume to give Orders, or Administer the Sacraments of the Church? Who shall be Depository of the Oaths and Leagues of Princes? Or, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate against the perjur'd Infractors of them? For my part (as Affairs now stand) I find not, how, either a general Peace amongst Princes, or any equal moderation in Humane Affairs,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56964:11"/>
can be well conserved without him. For, as his Court is a kind of Chancery, to all other Courts of Justice in the Christian World; so if you take it away, you subvert that Equity, and Conscience, which should be the Rule, and Interpreter of all Laws and Constitutions whatsoever. I will conclude, that, I wish your Highness (as my King and Sovereign), all true Greatness and Happiness; but think it not fit (in this Case) that your Subjects should either examine by what right Ecclesiastical Government is Innovated; or enquire how far they are bound thereby; since, beside that it might cause Division, and hazzard the Overthrow, both of the one and the other Authority; it would give that Offence and Scandal abroad, that Forein Princes would both reprove and disallow all our Proceedings in this kind, and upon occasion, be disposed easily to joyn against us.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This opened the first way to the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and gave encouragement to those who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto it: To which the King afforded no small countenance out of Politick Ends. But for his own part, he adhered to his Old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; severely Persecuting those that Dissented from it.

               <p>Now to give a more exact Account of the Grounds, and Progress of the Dissolution of these Monasteries; We will here insert a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, taken out of Mr. <hi>Dugdales Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Warwick-</hi>shire, Pag. 801. where he treats of the Dissolution of a particular Monastery of <hi>Nunnes,</hi> called <hi>Poles-worth;</hi> and upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Dissolution of all other <hi>Monasteries</hi> in the Kingdom. The Discourse is thus delivered.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I Find it left Recorded, by the Commissioners, that were imploy'd to take Surrender of the <hi>Monasteries</hi> in this Shire, <hi>Anno</hi> 29. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. viz. <hi>That after strict scrutiny, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the fame of the Countrey, but by Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of several Persons, they found these Nunnes, Virtuous, and Religious Women, and of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: And that in the Town, where the Monastery was, there were Fourty Four Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and but one Plough: the residue of the Inhabitants, being Artificers, who had their lively-hood by the Monastery.</hi> These implor'd the Mediation of <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> that it might not be suppress'd. Nevertheless, it was not the strict, and regular Lives of these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Ladies, nor any thing that might be said in the behalf of the <hi>Monasteries,</hi> that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ruine, then approaching: So great
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56964:17"/>
an aim had the King, to make himself thereby glorious; and many others, no less hopes, to be enrich'd, in a considerable manner.</p>
                  <p>But, to the end, that such a change should not overwhelm those that might be Active therein; in regard the People, every where, had no small esteem of these Houses, for their Devout and Daily Exercises of <hi>Prayer, Alms-deeds, Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and the like; whereby, not only the Souls of their <hi>Deceased Ancestors</hi> had much benefit, (as then was taught), but Themselves, the Poor, as also <hi>Strangers,</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims</hi> constant advantage; there wanted not the most subtil Contrivances, to effect this stupendious Work, that, I think, any Age hath beheld.</p>
                  <p>In order therefore to it, that, which <hi>Cardinal Wolsey</hi> had done, for the Founding his Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Ipswich,</hi> dissolving about Thirty <hi>Religious Houses,</hi> was made a President. Now that this business might be the better carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, Mr. <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> who had been an old Servant to the Cardinal, and not a little active in that, was the chief Person pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to assist therein.</p>
                  <p>For, I look upon this business, as not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally design'd by the King, but by some Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ambitious Men of that Age; who projected to themselves all worldly Advantages imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, through that deluge of Wealth, which was like to flow amongst them, by this hideous storm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56964:18"/>
First therefore, having insinuated to the King matter of Profit, and Honour: <hi>(Profit,</hi> by so vast an Enlargement of his Revenue; And <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> in being able to maintain mighty Armies, to recover his Right in <hi>France;</hi> as also to strengthen Himself against the Pope, whose <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> he had abolish'd; and withal to make a firmer Alliance with such Princes, as had done the like). Further, to promote this Design, they procured <hi>Cranmers</hi> Advancement to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and more of the <hi>Protestant Clergie,</hi> (as my Author terms them) to other Bishopricks, and high Places; to the end, that the rest should not be able, in a full Council, to carry any thing against their design; sending out <hi>Preachers,</hi> to perswade the People, to stand fast to the King, without fear of the Pope's Curse.</p>
                  <p>Next, that it might be the more plausibly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, care was taken so to represent the Lives of the <hi>Monks, Nunns, Canons, &amp;c.</hi> to the World, as that the less regret might be made at their ruine.</p>
                  <p>To which purpose, <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> being Constituted <hi>General Visitor,</hi> employ'd sundry Persons, who acted their parts therein accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>He likewise sent others, to whom he gave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions in Eighty Six Articles; by which they were to enquire into the Government, and Behaviour of the <hi>Religious,</hi> of both Sexes: Which Commissioners, the better to manage the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56964:18"/>
design, gave encouragement to the <hi>Monks,</hi> not only to <hi>Accuse</hi> their Governors, but to <hi>Inform</hi> against each other; compelling them also to produce their <hi>Charters,</hi> and <hi>Evidences,</hi> of their <hi>Lands;</hi> as also their <hi>Plate</hi> and <hi>Money;</hi> and to give an <hi>Inventory</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>And hereunto they added certain <hi>Injunctions,</hi> from the King, containing most <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>strict</hi> Rules; by means whereof, many being found obnoxious to their Censure, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; and others, discerning themselves not able to live free from Exception, or Advantage that might be taken against them, desired to leave their Habitations.</p>

of less value than Two hundred pounds by the year; giving them, with their <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> to the King; yet with this addition, That the Possessions belonging to such Houses, should be converted to better uses: But how well this was observ'd, we shall soon see: These specious pretences being made use of for no other purpose, than by opening this gap, to make way for the <hi>total Ruine</hi> of the <hi>Greater Houses;</hi> wherein notwithstanding, it is by the said Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweldged, that <hi>Religion was well observ'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, no sooner were the <hi>Monks</hi> turned out, and the Houses demolish'd, (that being first thought requisite, least some accidental Change might conduce to their restitution) but care was taken, to prefer such Persons to the Superiority in Government, upon any vacancy of these <hi>Great Houses,</hi> as might be Instrumental to their Surrender, by perswading with the Convent to that purpose.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that there was no omission of any endeavour, that can well be imagin'd, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish these Surrenders. For so subtlely did the Commissioners act their parts, that after ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest solicitation with all the Abbots, when they found them backwards, they tempted them with the promise of Good Pensions, during life.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the Courtiers unactive, in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on this Work: as may appear by my Lord Chancellor <hi>Audley</hi>'s employing a special A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, to treat with the Abbot of <hi>Athelney,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56964:20"/>
him a <hi>Hundred Marks</hi> a year, in case he would Surrender; and the personal endeavour that he us'd with the Abbot of <hi>Osiths</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> as by his Letter to the said <hi>Visitor,</hi> is evident: wherein is signified, that he had, with great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, prevail'd with the said Abbot: But withal, insinuated his desire, that his place of <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> being very chargeable, the King might be mov'd for an Addition of some <hi>more profitable Offices</hi> to him. Nay, I find, that this <hi>Great Man,</hi> hunting eagerly after the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of <hi>Waldon</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi> (out of the Ruines whereof, afterwards, that Magnificent Fabrick called by the Name of <hi>Audley</hi> Inn, was built) as an argument, the sooner to obtain it, did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the extenuation of its worth, alledge, that he had in this World, sustained great <hi>Damages</hi> and <hi>Infamy,</hi> in his serving the King; which the <hi>Grant</hi> of this should recompence.</p>
                  <p>Some Arguments were used by the <hi>Abbots</hi> to hinder these Suppressions; but nothing would avail. For resolv'd they were, to effect what they had begun, by one means or other: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as they procured the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to come to the Nunns of <hi>Syon,</hi> with their Confessor, to solicite them thereto: who, after many perswasions, took it upon their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they ought to submit to the King's pleasure therein, by God's Law. But what could not be effected by such Arguments, and fair Promises, was by terror and streight deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56964:21"/>
brought to pass. For under pretence of suffering Delapidations in the Buildings, or negligent administration of their Offices; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for breaking the Kings <hi>Injunctions,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd some Abbots, and then put others, that were more plyant in their rooms.</p>
                  <p>From others they took their <hi>Convent-Seals;</hi> to the end they might not, by making <hi>Leases,</hi> or <hi>Sale</hi> of their <hi>Jewels,</hi> raise Money, either for supply of their present Wants; or payment of their Debts; and so be necessitated to Surrender.</p>
                  <p>Nay, to some, as in particular to the Canons of <hi>Leicester,</hi> the Commissioners threatned, That they would charge them with <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Buggery,</hi> unless they would submit: And Dr. <hi>London</hi> told the <hi>Nunns</hi> of <hi>Godstow,</hi> That <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he found them obstinate, he would dissolve the House by vertue of the King's Commission, in spite of their Teeth.</hi> And yet all was so manag'd, that the King was solicited to accept of them, not being willing to have it thought, that they were by Terror moved thereto; and special notice was taken of those, who did give out, that their <hi>Surrenders</hi> were by <hi>Compulsion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which courses (after so many, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand corruption, had led the way) brought on others apace, as appears by their Dates, which I have observ'd from the very Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselves; insomuch as the rest stood amaz'd, not knowing which way to turn them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56964:21"/>
Some therefore thought fit to try, whether Money might save their Houses from this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fate, so near at hand. Others with great constancy refus'd to be thus <hi>accessory,</hi> in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Donations</hi> of their Pious Founders: But these tasted of no little severity. For, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Abbot of <hi>Fountains,</hi> in <hi>York-</hi>shire, I find, that being charg'd by the <hi>Commissioners</hi> for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into his hands some <hi>Jewels</hi> belonging to the <hi>Monastery,</hi> (which they call'd <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege),</hi> they pronounced him <hi>Perjur'd;</hi> and so deposing him, extorted a <hi>private Resignation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it appears, that the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-House,</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>London,</hi> were committed to <hi>Newgate;</hi> where, with hard and barbarous usage, Five of them died, and Five more lay at the point of death; as the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi> signified: But withal alledg'd, That the Suppression of <hi>that House,</hi> being of so strict a <hi>Rule,</hi> would occasion great Scandal to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for as much as it stood in the face of the World, infinite concourse, from all parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Populous City; and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it might be altered to some other use.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, that under the like pretence of <hi>rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Church,</hi> (wherewith the before specified Abbot of <hi>Fountains</hi> was charg'd) the Abbot of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> with Two of his <hi>Monks,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to death, was drawn from <hi>Wells</hi> upon a Hurdle, and then hang'd upon the Hill call'd <hi>the Tore,</hi> near <hi>Glastenbury;</hi> his Head set upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56964:22"/>
the <hi>Abbey-</hi>gate, and his <hi>Quarters</hi> dispos'd of to <hi>Wells, Bath, Ilchester,</hi> and <hi>Bridgewater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor did the Abbots of <hi>Colchester,</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> speed much better; as they that shall consult our story of that time, may see. And for further terror to the rest, some <hi>Priors,</hi> and other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons, who had spoken against the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> (a thing then somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, being so newly set up) were condemn'd as Traytors, and Executed.</p>
                  <p>And now, that all this was effected, to the end it might not be thought, that these things were done by a <hi>high Hand,</hi> a Parliament was called (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And the better to satisfie the vulgar, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to them, that by this Deluge of Wealth, the Kingdom should be strengthened with an Army of Forty Thousand men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> and that, for the future, they should never be charg'd with <hi>Subsidies, Fifteens, Loans,</hi> or <hi>Common Aides.</hi> By which means the Parliament Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying these <hi>Surrenders,</hi> the Work became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56964:22"/>
For the more firm Settling whereof, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den course was taken, to pull down, and destroy the Buildings, as had been done before, upon the Dissolution of the <hi>smaller Houses:</hi> Next, to disperse a great portion of the <hi>Lands,</hi> amongst the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. The <hi>Visitor General</hi> having told the King, That <hi>the more had interest in them, the more they would be irrevocable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And lest any Domestick stir should arise, by reason of this great, and strange Alteration, rumors were spread of great dangers from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Invasions; against which great Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made every where; which seemed so to excuse this Suppression of <hi>the Abbyes,</hi> as that the People (willing to spare their own Purses) began to suffer it easily.</p>
                  <p>But, let us look upon the Success. Wherein I find, that the said <hi>Visitor General</hi> (the grand <hi>Actor</hi> of this Tragical business) having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted upon himself an <hi>Odium</hi> from the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> by reason of his low Birth, and being raised to so high Dignities, (as likewise from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> for having thus Acted in the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Abbeys) was, (before the End of the said Parliament, wherein that was ratified, which he had, with so much Industry, brought to pass) deserted by the King; who, (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any more use of him) gave way to his Enemies Accusations. Whereupon, being Arrested by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Table,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56964:23"/>
when he least dream't of it, he was Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Condemned by the same Parliament, for <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Treason,</hi> unheard, and little pitied, and had his Head cut off on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> Nor did many of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers speed much better: For Fire and Fagot, happened to be their Portion.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>the fruit,</hi> the People reap'd, from all their hopes, built upon these specious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, it was very little: For <hi>Subsidies</hi> from the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Fifteens</hi> of all <hi>Laymens</hi> Goods, were soon after exacted. And in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, the Commons were constrained to Supply the King's wants by a new Invention; to wit, <hi>Sheep, Cloaths, Goods, Debts,</hi> &amp;c. for Three years: which Tax grew so heavy, that the year following they prayed the King for miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a little observable, that whilst the Monasteries stood, there was no Act <hi>for Relief of the Poor:</hi> so amply did those Houses give succor to them. Whereas in the next Age, to wit, the 39 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> no less then <hi>Eleven Bills</hi> were brought into the House of <hi>Commons</hi> for that purpose.</p>

                           <p>THe King's Most Royal Majesty, most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently considering, that by occasion of various Opinions, and Judgments, concerning some <hi>Articles</hi> in Religion, great discord, and variance hath arisen; as well, amongst the <hi>Clergy</hi> of this Realm, as amongst a great number of the vulgar People: And being in a full hope, and trust, that a full and perfect Resolution of the said <hi>Articles</hi> would make a perfect <hi>Concord,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> generally amongst all His Loving,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56964:25"/>
and Obedient Subjects, of His most Excellent Goodness, not only Commanded that the said <hi>Articles</hi> should Deliberately, and Advisedly, by His Archbishops, Bishops, and other Learned Men of His Clergy, be Debated, Argued, and Reasoned, and their Opinions therein to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, Declared and Known: But also most Graciously vouchsafed, in his own Princely Person, to come unto his High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Council, and there, like a wise Prince of most high Prudence, and no less Learning, opened, and declared many Things of most high Learning, and great Knowledge, touching the said Articles, Matters, and Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for an Unity to be had in the same.</p>
                           <p>Whereupon, after a great, and long, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and advised Disputation, and Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had, and made concerning the said <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> as well by the consent of the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as by the Assent of the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> and other Leaned Men of His Clergy, in their Convocations, and by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament Assembled, it was, and is, finally resolved, accorded, and Agreed, in manner, and form following; that is to say,</p>

It was now the Twenty eighth year of King <hi>Henries</hi> Reign: When there were <hi>solemn Justs</hi> at <hi>Greenwich;</hi> from whence the King suddenly departed, and came to <hi>Westminster:</hi> Whose sudden departure struck amazement into many; but to the Queen especially: And not without cause. For the next day the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> her Brother, and <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> were brought to the Tower, Prisoners: Whither also the same day, was brought Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> her self: Who at the Tower-gate fell on her knees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching God to help her, as she was innocent of that, whereof she was accused.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, she was arraigned in the Tower, and found guilty, and had Judgment pronounced. Immediately the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> her Brother, was likewise Arraigned: Who, together with <hi>Henry Norris, Mark Smeton, William Brierton,</hi> and <hi>Francis Weston,</hi> all of the King's Privy-Chamber, about matters touching the Queen, were beheaded on Tower-hill.</p>
                  <p>Within Two days, Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> her self, on a Scaffold, upon the Green within the Tower, was also beheaded.</p>
                  <p>At her death she spake these words: <hi>God save my Master, and Sovereign, the King; the most Goodliest, Noblest, and Gentlest Prince, that is; and grant him, that he may long Reign over you:</hi> (which words she spake with a smiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:) which done, she kneeled down, and the Hangman of <hi>Calais</hi> smote off her head at one stroke.</p>

For her Religion, she was an earnest Profess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and one of the first Counternancers of the Gospel. The Crimes, for which she died, were <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Incest.</hi> She had many Enemies, as being a Protestant; and perhaps, in that res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the King himself not greatly her Friend. For, though he had excluded the Pope, yet he continued a Papist still.</p>
                  <p>Her Death cast upon King <hi>Henry</hi> a dishonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Imputation: Insomuch, that whereas the <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> had resolved to chuse him for <hi>Head</hi> of their <hi>League;</hi> after they heard of this Queens Death, they utterly refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. </p>

                  <p>When he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-hill,</hi> to be executed, he spake these words,</p>

But bear me witness, That I die in the Catholick Faith of the holy Church: And I desire you to pray for me, that so long as life remains in this Flesh, I waver nothing in my Faith.

               <p>This following Relation, (although it concerns not the shedding of Blood) yet is very remarkable, as manifesting, how the King's Marriage with the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> was in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared not lawful: Which is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Howes,</hi> upon <hi>Stow,</hi> Page 578.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>AFter the Death of the Lady <hi>Jane Seymour,</hi> the King's Third Wife; He Married the Lady <hi>Anne of Cleve,</hi> in the <hi>Two and thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> year of his Reign: From which time the King, not only continued his first Misliking of her; but his hatred encreased more and more against her; not only for want of beauty, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at first he took exceptions) but also for sundry other qualities, whereof he secretly accused her: As also he said, that her body was unpleasant,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56964:29"/>
making great doubt, that she was no Virgin, when she came into <hi>England;</hi> with divers other defects, which he said, he knew, by her outward appearance, to be in her. And being thus so sore perplexed, and desperate of redress, he grew wondrous apt, and willing to call in question any thing, that might tend to the dissolving of this Marriage.</p>
                  <p>Within Eight dayes the King told his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, his further cause of grief, That she was loathsome to him in Bed, and that her Body was foul, and out of order.</p>
                  <p>The King being thus tormented in Body, and Mind, knew not how to ease himself, until he had procured a speedy <hi>Divorce:</hi> Which was thus effected.</p>
                  <p>Certain Lords came down into the <hi>Lower-House</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> expresly declaring the causes, why this Marriage was not Lawful: And, in conclusion, the matter was by <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> clearly determined, that the King might lawfully marry, where he would; and so might she.</p>
                  <p>It appears clearly in the Record, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King to this Marriage. For these are his words:</p>
                  <q>I declare, that when the first Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was had with me, about this Marriage, I was glad to hearken to it; trusting to have some assured Friend by it: I much doubting, at that time, both the <hi>Emperor, France,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>THe King was informed of the Queens diss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olute life; first, before her Marriage, with one <hi>Francis Dereham;</hi> and since her Marriage, with one <hi>Thomas Culpepper,</hi> of the King's Bed-Chamber.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Delinquents being examined, <hi>Dereham</hi> confessed, that before the King's Marriage with the Lady <hi>Catherine,</hi> there had been a pre-contract between him and her. But when once he understood of the King's good liking to her, he then waved it, and concealed it, for her preferment.</p>
                  <p>These Gentlemen were arraigned, and had Judgment to die, as in cases of Treason.</p>
                  <p>They were drawn from the Tower to <hi>Tyburn;</hi> Where <hi>Culpepper</hi> was beheaded, and <hi>Dereham</hi> hanged, and dismember'd.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56964:30"/>
Queens misdemeanour, and adjudged to forfeit all their Lands, and Goods, during life, and to remain in perpetual Prison.</p>
                  <p>The Lords and Commons in Parliament Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the King, That he would not vex him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Queens Offences; and that both she, and the Lady <hi>Rochford,</hi> might be Attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Parliament: And that to avoid protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time, he would give his Royal Assent to it, under the Great Seal, without staying for the end of the Parliament.

                  <p>After this, the Queen, and the Lady <hi>Rochford,</hi> were beheaded, on the Green within the Tower.

to hear him. Whereupon a Throne was set up in the Hall of the King's Palace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for the King to sit.

But all would not do; for he remained obstinate, the King miss'd his Honor, and the Delinquent his Pardon: Being shortly after drawn to <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and burnt.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THese horred Cruelties made the state of Religion in <hi>England</hi> in a strange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; as appears by this Relation of Sir <hi>Rich. Baker, page</hi> 408.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And now was the state of Religion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> come to a strange pass, because always in <hi>Passing,</hi> and had no Consistence. For at first, the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Pope was excluded in some cases only; a while after in all: But yet his <hi>Doctrine</hi> was wholly receiv'd. Afterwards his <hi>Doctrine</hi> came to be impugn'd; but yet in some few points only; a while after, in many: That the Fable of <hi>Proteus</hi> might be no longer a Fable; when the Religion of <hi>England</hi> might be its true Moral.</p>
                  <p>The Confusion was so great in these times, that in Parliament one called the other <hi>Heretick,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptist;</hi> and he again called him <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> and <hi>Hypocrite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this not only amongst the <hi>Temporality,</hi> but even the Clergy-men themselves preach'd, and enveigh'd, one against another. So that the Frame of Religion was extremely disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56964:33"/>
the <hi>Clergie</hi> that should set it in Frame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of frame themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Minds of the People extremely distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Nobility, that should cement them together, scarce holding themselves together. </p>

                           <p>WHat <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> is there amongst you, when one calls another <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> and he calls him again <hi>Papist, Hypocrite,</hi> and <hi>Pharisee!</hi> I must needs judge the fault, and occasion of this Discord, to be partly by negligence of you, the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>Spirituality.</hi> For I hear daily, that you of the <hi>Clergie</hi> Preach one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Teach one contrary to another, railing one against another.</p>
                           <p>Some are so stiff in their old <hi>Mumpsimus;</hi> others are so busie and furious in their new <hi>Sumpsimus,</hi> that all men almost be in Variety, and Discord; and few, or none, preach truly and sincerely the Word of God. Now, how can poor Souls live in concord, when you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56964:34"/>
                              <hi>Preachers,</hi> sow amongst them in your Sermons, Debate and Discord? Of you they look for <hi>light,</hi> and you lead them into <hi>darkness.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, although I say, that <hi>Spiritual-men</hi> be in some fault, that <hi>Charity</hi> is not kept amongst you; yet <hi>you of the Temporality,</hi> be not clear and unspotted, from malice and envy. For you rail at <hi>Bishops,</hi> speak slanderously of <hi>Priests,</hi> and rebuke and taunt <hi>Preachers.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>You must understand, that although you be permitted to read <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and to have the <hi>Word of God</hi> in your Mother-tongue; yet this Licence is given you only to inform your Conscience, and to instruct your Children, and not to dispute, and make <hi>Scripture</hi> a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a taunting-stock against <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Preachers,</hi> as many light persons do. I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sorry to hear how irreverently that most precious Jewel <hi>(the Word of God)</hi> is Disputed, Rimed, Sung, and Jangled in every Ale-house and Tavern; contrary to the true meaning and Doctrine of the same.

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56964:34"/>These Confusions, and others, are thus related by Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> in his History of Reformation. <hi>Page</hi> 17.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>THE People were generally divided into Factions and Schisms; The Treasures of the Crown were exhausted by prodigal Gifts, and the Money of the Realm so mix'd, that it could not pass for currant amongst Forein Nations, to the great dishonor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and loss of the Merchant. For although an infinite Mass of Jewels, Treasure of Plate, and ready Money, and an incredible improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Revenue, had accrued to him; by such an universal Spoil and Dissolution of Religious Houses, yet was he little or nothing the richer for it: insomuch, that in the year 1543. (being within less than Seven years after the general Suppression of <hi>Religious Houses)</hi> he was forc'd to have recourse for Moneys to his Houses of Parliament: by which he was supply'd after an extraordinary manner; the Clergy, at the same time, giving him a Subsidy of <hi>six shillings in the Pound,</hi> to be paid out of their Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions; poor Stipendiary Priests, paying each of them <hi>six shillings, eight pence,</hi> to encrease the Sum: which also was so soon consumed, that the next year he press'd his Subjects to a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence;</hi> and in the following year, he obtain'd the Grant of all Chantries, Hospitals, Colleges,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56964:35"/>
and Free-Chappels, within the Realm; though he lived not to enjoy the benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>Most true it is, that it was somewhat of the latest, before he cast his Eye on the Lands of Bishopricks: though there were some, that thought the time long, till they fell upon them. Concerning which there goes a story, That after the <hi>Court-Harpies</hi> had devoured the greatest part of the Spoyl, which came by the Suppression of <hi>Abbeys,</hi> they began to seek some other way, to satiate that greedy Appetite, which the division of the former Booty had left unsatisfied. And for the satisfying whereof, they found not any thing so necessary, as the Bishops Lands.</p>
                  <p>This to Effect, Sir <hi>Thomas Seymour</hi> is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the fittest man, being in Favor with the King, and Brother to Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> his most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and best Wife; and having opportunity of access unto him, as being one of his Privy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And he not having any good affection to Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> desired, that the <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> should be try'd on him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore took his time to inform the King, that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did nothing but fell his Woods, letting long Leases for great Fines, and making havock of the Royalties of his Arch Bishoprick, to raise thereby a Fortune to his Wife, and Children. Withal, he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King, That the Archbishop kept no Hospitality, in respect of such a large Revenue; and that in the Opinion of many wise men, it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56964:35"/>
was more convenient for the Bishops to have a sufficient <hi>yearly stipend</hi> out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> than to be so encumbred with Temporal Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; being so great a hinderance to their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Pastoral Charge; and that the Lands, and Royalties, being taken to his Majesties use, would afford him (besides the said Annual Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends) a great yearly Revenue.</p>
                  <p>The King, considering of it, could not think fit, that such a plausible Proposition, as taking to himself the Lands of Bishops, should be made in vain: only he was resolv'd to prey further off, and not to fall upon the spoyl too near the Court, for fear of having more partakers in the Booty, than might stand with his profit.</p>
                  <p>And to this end he deals with <hi>Holgate</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not long before, from <hi>Landaff,</hi> to the See of <hi>York:</hi> from whom he takes, at one time, no fewer than <hi>Seventy Mannors,</hi> and <hi>Townships,</hi> of good <hi>old Rents;</hi> giving him, in exchange, to the like yearly value, certain Impropriations, Pensions, Tythes, and Portions of Tythes, (but all of an extended <hi>Rent)</hi> which had accrued to the Crown by the Fall of Abbeys: <hi>Which Lands,</hi> he laid, by Act of Parliament, to the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> For which see 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>He dismembred also, by these Acts, certain Mannors from the See of <hi>London;</hi> and others, in like manner from the See of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but not without some reasonable Compensation for them.</p>
                  <p>

And although, by reason of his death, which followed within a short time after, there was no further Alienation made, in his time, of the Churches Patrimony; yet having open'd such a gap, and discovered this Secret, that the Sacred Patrimony might be Alienated with so little trouble, the Courtiers of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, would not be kept from breaking violently into it, and making up their own Fortune, in the spoyl of Bishopricks. So impossible a thing it is, for the ill Examples of Great Princes, not to find followers in all Ages; especially, where <hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Preferment,</hi> may be furthered by it. </p>

               <p>By this, and what hath been said in these <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> it evidently appears, that all Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both Civil, and Ecclesiastical; as likewise the Lives of all men, in the Reign of this King, depended upon the Arbitrary Government of those times.</p>
               <p>Now we must end this story, concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion in this Kings Reign, with a brief Relation of his Death, with a Summary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Wives, and the years of his Reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Relation of his Death is thus deliver'd by Dr.</hi> Heylyn, <hi>in his History of Reformation.</hi> Page <hi>14.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>THe King, having lived a voluptuous Life, and too much indulged to his Palate, was grown so corpulent, or rather so over-grown
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56964:37"/>
with an unweildy burthen of Flesh, that he was not able to go up Stairs, from one Room to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but as he was hoised up by an Engine: which filling his Body with foul and foggy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, did both wast his Spirits, and encrease his Passions. In the midst of which Distempers, it was not his least care to provide for the Succession of the Crown to his own Posterity. At such time as he married <hi>Anne Bulleign,</hi> He procur'd his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> to be declar'd <hi>Illegitimate,</hi> by Act of Parliament: The like he also did by his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when he had married <hi>Jane Seymour;</hi> settling the Crown upon his Issue by the said Queen <hi>Jane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But having no other Issue by her, but Prince <hi>Edward;</hi> and none at all by his following Wives, he thought it a point of prudence to establish the Succession by more Stayes than one. For which cause he procured an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the 35 year of his Reign, in which it is declared, <hi>That in default of Issue of the said Prince</hi> Edward, <hi>the Crown should be entail'd to the Kings Daughter, the Lady</hi> Mary, <hi>and the Heirs of her Body: And so likewise to the Lady</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and the Heirs of her Body: And for lack of such Issue, to such, as the King by his Letters Patents, or his last Will in Writing, should limit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which Act of Parliament, he, being now sick, and fearing his approaching end, made such use, in laying down the state of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56964:37"/>
to the Crown, in this Last Will, that (contrary to all Justice) he totally Excluded the whole <hi>Scottish-Line</hi> (Descended from the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> his eldest Sister) from all hopes of having their turns in it.</p>
                  <p>His Infirmity, and the weakness it brought upon him, confining him to his Bed, he had a great desire to receive the Sacrament: and being perswaded to receive it in the easiest posture (sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or raised up in his Bed) he would by no means yield unto it; but caus'd himself to be taken up, and plac'd in his Chair; in which he heard the greatest part of the Mass, till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration; and then receiv'd the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his Knees, as at other times; saying withal, (as <hi>Saunders</hi> relates the Story) <hi>That if he did not only cast himself upon the Ground, but even under it also, he could not give unto the Sacrament, the Honor that was due unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The instant of his Death approaching, none of his Servants (though thereunto desir'd by his Physicians) durst acquaint him with it: till at last Sir <hi>Anthony Denny</hi> undertook that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Office: which the King entertaining with less impatience than was looked for from him, gave order, that Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> should be presently sent for. But he being then at <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> it was so long before he came, that he found him speechless. However, applying himself to the Kings present condition, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing to Him on this Point, <hi>That Salvation</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:56964:38"/>
                     <hi>was to be obtain'd only by Faith in Christ:</hi> He desired the King, (if he understood the effect of his words, and believ'd the same) that he would signifie so much by some Sign or other: which the King did, by wringing him gently by the Hand; and shortly after died.</p>
                  <p>There is a sharp, but shrewd Character of this King; to wit, That <hi>he never sparea Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his Lust, nor Man in his Anger.</hi> Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh</hi> says of him, That <hi>if all the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of a Merciless Prince had been lost in the World, they might have been found in this King.</hi>

               <p>I will here set down some Passages out of his last Will, related by Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> pag. 23. By which it will appear, how constant he was till his death, in professing and maintaining these following Points of Catholick Doctrine; to wit, The Real Presence in the Sacrament: Invocation of Saints: and Prayer for the Dead. <hi>The words of the Will are these;</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>WE most humbly, and heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Soul to God: who, in the Person of his Son redeemed us with his most precious Body and Blood. And for our better remembrance thereof, hath left here with us, in his Church Militant, the Consecration, and Administration of his most precious Body and Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56964:38"/>
We also instantly desire, that the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> with all the Holy Company of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may continually pray for us, whilst we live in this World; and at our passing out of it; that we may the sooner attain everlasting life.</p>
                  <p>We likewise further Ordain, That there be a convenient Altar at <hi>Windsor,</hi> honorably prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with all things requisite, and necessary, for a daily Mass, there to be said perpetually, while the World should endure.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, He gave Order, That all Divine Offices accustomed for the Dead, should be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Celebrated for him.</p>
                  <p>And, that at the removal of his Body to <hi>Windsor,</hi> a Thousand Marks should be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongst the Poor, to pray for the Remission of his Sins, and the good of his Soul. </p>

                              <p>The Sixth, <hi>Catherine Parre,</hi> being an earnest Protestant, was accused to the King, to have He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Books in her Closet: and this was so ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated against her, that they prevail'd with the King to Sign a Warrant to Commit her to the Tower, with a purpose to have burnt her for Heresie. This <hi>Warrant</hi> was committed to <hi>Wriothsley,</hi> Lord Chancellor; and he, by chance letting it fall from him, it was taken up, and carried to the Queen; who having read it, went soon after to visit the King. Being come to the King, he presently fell into Talk with her, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some Points of Religion, demanding her Resolution therein.</p>
                              <p>But she knowing, that his nature was not to be cross'd, specially considering the case she was in, made him answer, <hi rend="margQuotes">That She was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, accompanied with many Imperfections; but his Majesty was Wise, and Judicious, of whom she must learn, as of her Lord, and Head.</hi>

it hath been to learn some Point of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, whereof I stood in doubt: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that with my Talk I might make you forget your present infirmity. And is it so,</hi> (says King) <hi>Then we are Friends.</hi>

                           <p>The Queen, seeing the King so angry with him, began to intreat him; to whom the King said, <hi>You little know, what it is he came about. Of my Word, Sweet-heart, he hath been a very Knave to Thee.</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>IN the Eighth year of this King's Reign, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> began to Preach against the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to bring in a Reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56964:40"/>
for repressing of whom the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was called by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p>At the same time, with <hi>Luther,</hi> there arose also, in the same Country, other <hi>Reformers</hi> of Religion, as <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon, &amp;c.</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> differing from <hi>Luther</hi> in some Points, made the difference, which is, at this day, of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi> so call'd at first at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> for making a <hi>Protestation,</hi> in defence of their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>In his Two and twentieth year, a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was set forth, That no Person should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase any thing from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> and this was the first beginning of his Deserting the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Three and twentieth year, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy submitting themselves to the King, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found guilty of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> were the first that called him <hi>Supreme Head of the Church;</hi> yet with this restriction, <hi>So far as it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto Gods Word;</hi> and not otherwise.</p>
                  <p>In his Four and twentieth year, an Act of Parliament was made, That no Person should Appeal, for any Cause, out of this Realm, to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Twenty sixth year, an Act was made, which Authoriz'd the King to be <hi>Supreme Head of the Church of</hi> England, and the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> to be abolish'd; and then also was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the King the <hi>First Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Tenths,</hi> of all <hi>Spiritual Livings:</hi> and this Year were many
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56964:40"/>
put to death: <hi>Papists</hi> for denying the <hi>Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: Protestants,</hi> for denying the <hi>Real Presence</hi> in the Sacrament: nor is it credible, what numbers suffered death, for these two Causes, in the last <hi>Ten Years</hi> of the Kings Reign: of whom, if we should make particular menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would reach a great way in the <hi>Book of Martyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Eight and twentieth Year, the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> was made <hi>Vicar General,</hi> under the King, over the <hi>Spirituality:</hi> and at least <hi>Four Hundred</hi> Monasteries were suppress'd, and all their Lands and Goods, conferred upon the King, by an Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In his One and thirtieth Year, was set forth by the Bishops, the Book of the <hi>Six Articles;</hi> and all the rest of the Monasteries were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him.</p>

               <p>THIS is a Summary Account of this King's Reign, (as to these matters of Religion) taken out of the <hi>Preface</hi> of Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s History of Reformation.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56964:41"/>
the Stage, whose Name was made use of to serve Turns withal, and his Authority abused to his own undoing.</p>
                  <p>In his First year, the <hi>Reformation</hi> was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on, but on different ends; endeavoured by some Bishops, and others of the Lower Clergy; and promoted with the like Zeal and Industry, but not with like Integrity, by some great Men about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rt: Who, under Colour of removing corruptions out of the Church, had cast their eyes upon the Spoil of Shrines and Images, (though still preserved in the greatest part of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches) and the improving their own Fortunes by the Chantry Lands: All which they most Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously divided amongst themselves, without admitting the poor King to share with them; though nothing but the filling his Coffers, by the Spoil of <hi>the one,</hi> and the Encrease of his Revenue by the fall of <hi>the other,</hi> was openly pretended in the Conduct of it.</p>
                  <p>But to speak no more of this, the work chiefly intended, was vigorously carried on by the King and his Counsellors, as appears by the Doctrinals in the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> and by the Practical part of Christian Piety.</p>
                  <p>And here the business might have rested, if <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Pragmatical Spirit had not interposed. He first began to quarrel at some passages in the Liturgy; and afterwards never left Soliciting the Lord Protector, and practising, by his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56964:42"/>
Agents, on the Court, the Country, and the Universities, till he had laid the first Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Zuinglian Faction;</hi> who laboured nothing more than Innovation, both in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline:</hi> to which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by nothing more, than some impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Indulgence, granted unto <hi>John Alasco;</hi> who bringing with him a mixed multitude of <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> obtained the Priviledge of a Church for himself, and his, distinct in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This much animated the <hi>Zuinglian Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> to practice, first upon the Church; who being Countenanced, if not Headed by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> (who then began to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Lord Protector) first quarrelled the Episcopal Habit; and afterwards enveighed against Caps, and Surplices; against Gowns and Tippets: But fell at last upon <hi>the Altars,</hi> which were left standing by the Rules of the Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>The touching upon this string made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Musick, to most of the Grandees of the Court; who had, before, cast many an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye, on those costly Hangings, that massy Plate, and other Rich and Precious things, which adorned those Altars.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>what need all this wast,</hi> said <hi>Judas,</hi> when one poor Chalice only, and perhaps not that, might have served the turn. Beside,

there was no small spoil to be made of <hi>Copes;</hi> in which the Priest Officiated at the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Some of them being made of Cloth of Tissue, Cloth of Gold and Silver, or Embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Velvet; the meanest being made of Silk, or Sattin, with some decent Trimming.</p>
                  <p>And might not these be handsomely convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto private uses, to serve as Carpets to their Tables, Coverlets to their Beds, or Cushions for their Chairs, and Windows. Hereupon some rude People are encouraged, under-hand, to beat down some Altars; which makes way for an Order of the Council-Table, to take down the rest, and set up Tables in their places; followed by a Commission, to be executed in all parts of the Kingdom, for seizing on the Premises for the King's use.</p>
                  <p>But as the Grandees of the Court intended to defraud the King of so great a booty; and the Commissioners to put a cheat upon the Court-Lords, who employed them in it: So they were both prevented, in some places, by the Lords and Gentry of the Country; who thought the Altar-cloths, together with the Copes, and Plate of their several Churches, to be as necessary for themselves, as for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>This Change drew on the Alteration of the former Liturgy, but almost as unpleasing to the <hi>Zuinglian Faction,</hi> as the former was. In which conjuncture of Affairs, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56964:43"/>
From the begining of whose Reign, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began: All that was done, in order to it, under King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, seemed but <hi>accidental</hi> only, and by the by, rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed on Private Ends, than out of any settled purpose of a Reformation; and therefore inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and resumed again, as those Ends had variance. But now the great Work was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with a constant hand; the Clergy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with the King, and the Council, for the effecting of it.</p>
                  <p>But scarce had they brought it to this pass, when King <hi>Edward</hi> died; whose Death I cannot reckon for an infelicity to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For, being ill principled in himsels, and easily enclined to embrace such Counsels, as were offered to him, it is not to be thought, but that the rest of the Bishopricks (before suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently impoverished) must have followed <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the poor Church be left as destitute of Lands, and Ornaments, as when she came into the World, in her Natural Nakedness.</p>
                  <p>Nor was it like to happen otherwise, in the following Reign of Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> if it had lasted longer than a <hi>Nine-days</hi> wonder.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Dudley,</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who then ruled the rost, and had, before, dissolved, and in hope devoured, the wealthy Bishoprick of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> might easily have possessed himself of the greatest part of the Revenues of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle.</hi> By means whereof he would have made

himself more absolute on the North-side of <hi>Trent,</hi> than the poor Titular Queen had been on the South-side of it: To carry on whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and maintain her Title, the poor remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Churches Patrimony was, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to have been shared amongst those of the Party, to make them sure unto that side. </p>

                  <p>THE Solemnities of the Coronation being passed, the Grandees of the Court began to entertain some thoughts of a <hi>Reformation.</hi> In which they found Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and some other Bishops, to be as forward as themselves; but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56964:44"/>
on different ends; endeavoured by the Bishops out of Zeal, but by the Courtiers, upon a hope of enriching themselves by the spoil of Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. To the Advancement of which Work, the Conjuncture seemed to be as proper, as they could desire. Fot first, the King being of such tender Age, and wholly governed by the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ll of the Lord Protector, who had declared himself a Friend to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party, in the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> was easie to be moulded into any form: And as the Champions of the Papacy were removed out of all Office, so it was thought expedient, for the better carrying on of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, not only to release all such, as had been committed unto Prison, but also to recal all such, as had been forced to abandon the Kingdom, for not submitting to King <hi>Henries</hi> Six Articles. But the business was of greater moment, than to expect the coming back of these Men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither to lose time, nor to press too much at once upon the People, it was thought fit, to smooth the way to the intended Reformation, by setting out some <hi>Preparatory Injunctions:</hi> and this to be done by sending out <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> into all parts of the Kingdom, armed with <hi>Instructions,</hi> to enquire into all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Concernments: Which <hi>Commissioners</hi> were <hi>accompanied</hi> with Preachers, appointed to instruct the People.</p>
                  <p>And, that they might not cool, or fall off again from what they had been taught, they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56964:44"/>
were to leave some <hi>Homilies</hi> with the Parish-Priest; (which the Archbishop had composed.)</p>
                  <p>Now, besides the Points, contained in the said <hi>Injunctions,</hi> the Preachers were to perswade them from <hi>Invocation of Saints, Praying for the Dead, Images, Use of Beads, Ashes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, Mass, Dirges,</hi> &amp;c. All which was done to this intent, That the People, being prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by little and little, might with more ease, and less opposition, admit the total Alteration in the face of the Church, which was intended, in due time, to be introduced. </p>

The Lord Protector, and his Party, were more experienced in Affairs of State, than to be told, That all great Counsels, tending to Innovation in the Publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (especially where Religion is concerned) are, either to be back'd by Arms, or otherwise prove destructive to the undertakers.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56964:45"/>

                  <p>A Parliament began, upon the Fourth of <hi>November,</hi> in which the Cards were so well pack'd by Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi> that there was no need of any further Shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, till the end of the Game: This very Parliament, without any sensible Alteration of the Members of it, being continued until the Death of the King. And though this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consisted of such Members, as disagreed amongst themselves in respect of Religion; yet they agreed well enough together, in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56964:46"/>
Principle; which was, to serve the present time, and preserve themselves: which appears plainly, by the strange mixture of the Acts, and Results thereof; some tending to the present Benefit, and Enriching of particular Persons: And some again, being devised on purpose, to prepare a way for exposing the Revenues of the Church, unto spoil, and rapine.</p>
                  <p>There was an Act made in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time: Inhibiting the reading of the Old and New Testament, in the English Tongue. But this was here abrogated, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all, and every Act, or Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, concerning Doctrine, and matters of Religion, and all and every Article, Branch, Sentence, and Matter, Pains, and Forfeitures, in the same contained. By which repeal, all Men seem to have been put into a liberty of reading Scripture, and being in a manner, their own Expositors; and of entertaining what Opinions in Religion best pleased their fancies; and promulgating such Opinions, as they entertained: So that the <hi>English</hi> enjoyed that liberty, which the <hi>Romans</hi> are affirmed, by <hi>Tacitus</hi> to have enjoyed, without control, in the times of <hi>Nerva;</hi> that is to say, <hi>A liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being of what Opinion they pleased, and of speaking freely their Opinions, wheresoever they listed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was also an Act passed, Entituled, <hi>An Act against such, as speak against the Sacrament</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56964:46"/>
                     <hi>of the Altar.</hi> And to say truth, it was but time, that some provision should be made, to suppress that Irreverence and Profaneness, with which the Blessed Sacrament, was, at that time, handled, by too many of those, who seemed most ignorantly Zealous of Reformation. For, they reproached it with such names, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the mouths of Christians, that they were never taken up by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was another Act passed, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Communion <hi>in both kinds;</hi> yet with these Provisoes notwithstanding, <hi>If ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity did not otherwise require;</hi> as in the Case of sudden Sickness, and other such like Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; in which it was not possible, that Wine could be provided for the use of that Sacrament; nor the sick Man depart in peace without it. And Secondly, That the permitting this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the People of <hi>England,</hi> should not be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as a condemning of any other Church or Churches, or their Practices, in which the contrary is observed.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56964:47"/>

By the last branch thereof, it was plain, and evident, That the intent of the Contrivers, was by degrees to weaken the Authority of the Episcopal Order, by forcing them from their strong hold of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution,</hi> and making them no other, than the King's Ministers only; his <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sheriffs,</hi> as a Man might say, to execute
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56964:48"/>
his Will, and disperse his Mandates. And of this Act such use was made, That the Bishops of those times were not in a capacity of <hi>Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Orders,</hi> but as they were thereunto impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by special Licence.

                     <p>Which being looked upon by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> not only as a dangerous Diminution of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Power, but as likewise an odious Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, She caused this Act to be Repealed in the First year of her Reign.</p>
                     <p>There was also, in the first branch, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, than did appear.

                  <p>I will take leave here, (although it be not its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place) to insert an Act of Parliament of the third year of this King's Reign, concerning the Form to be used in making of Bishops. The words of the Act are these: to wit,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>THat such form and Manner of Making, and Consecrating of Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, as by Six Prelates, and Six other Learned Men, or by the most number of them (they being appointed, and assigned by the King) shall be devised for that purpose, and set forth under the Great Seal, shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, as lawfully exercised, and Used, and no other.</p>

                  <p>From this Alteration, which was made in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in reference to the making of Bishops, and the way of Exercising their Authority, we shall find, in the Progress of this story, That there was great Havock and Spoyl made of the Bishopricks themselves. Two Examples, and Testimonies whereof here immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Related thus by Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> pag. 129.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>THe See of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> being vacant, it was kept void from <hi>August</hi> till the next <hi>June:</hi> During which interval, the Patrimony of that great and wealthy Bishoprick (one of the richest
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56964:49"/>
in the Kingdom) was so dismembred in it self, so parcelled out for a prey to others, That when the new Bishop was to be restored to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, there was none of all his Mannors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for him, but his Mannor of <hi>Bugden,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some Farms and Impropriations: The rest was to be raised out of the Profits of his Jurisdiction: Yet so, that nothing was to be abated in his Tenths and First Fruits; which were kept up according to their former value.</p>

Many such strange Donations we shall find in others: The more to be excused, because there was no other Means (as the times then were) to preserve the whole, but by advancing some part thereof, to preserve the rest. </p>

               <q>
                  <p>NO sooner was this year begun, but it was Ordered by the King, and his Privy Council, that no Candles should be born upon <hi>Candlemas-</hi>day, nor <hi>Ashes,</hi> or <hi>Palms,</hi> used any longer.</p>
                  <p>The Lords drove this business on so fast, That before this Order could be published in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the Kingdom, they followed it with another, (as little pleasing to the main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People) concerning the taking down of all Images; which in some places of the Realm, were either not taken down at all (as was required the year before, by the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions), or had been Re-edified again, as soon, as the first heats of the Visitation had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cool.</p>
                  <p>Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> in a Letter of his, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his great dislike of some proceedings had at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> in taking down the Images of Christ,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56964:50"/>
and his Saints: certifying withal, That he had not only seen these Images, standing in all the Churches of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> but that <hi>Luther</hi> himself had purposly written a Book against some men, that had defaced them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be well thought, that Covetousness spurred on this business, more than Zeal: There being none of these Images so poor, and mean, the spoyl whereof would not afford some Gold, and Silver, (if not Jewels also) besides Censers, Candlesticks, and many other rich Utensils, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to them. In which respect, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners hereto Authorized were entertained, in many places, with scorn, and railing; and the further they went from <hi>London,</hi> the worse they were handled: Insomuch, as that one of them, as he was pulling down an Image in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> was stabbed. And though the Principal Offender was hanged, (which quieted all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for a time) yet the next year the storm broke out more violently than before; not only to the endangering of the peace of those Western Counties but in a manner of all the Kingdom.</p>

There being nothing, of which People commonly are so tender, as they are of Religion; on which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56964:51"/>
their happiness depends, not only for this world, but the world to come.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it concerned them, in point of Prudence, to let the People see, that there was no intention to abolish all their ancient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. And in particular, it was held expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to give the generality of the Subjects some contentment, in a Proclamation for the strict keeping of <hi>Lent;</hi> and the Example of the Court in Pursuance of it.</p>
                  <p>For Dr. <hi>Glasier,</hi> Preaching at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, affirmed, That <hi>Lent</hi> was not Ordained of God to be Fasted; neither the eating of Flesh to be forborn: But, that the same was a Politick Ordinance of men, and therefore might be broken by men at their pleasures. Upon this, there was no scarcity of those, that cried down all the Observations of Days and Times; even to the Libelling against that ancient and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fast, in most scandalous Rhymes: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint whereof being made by Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> to the Lord Protector, a Proclamation was set out; by which all People were commanded to abstain from Flesh in the time of <hi>Lent;</hi> and the King's <hi>Lenten-dyet</hi> was set out, and served, as in former times.</p>

                  <p>But notwithstanding the setting forth of this Uniform Order of Administring the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, yer there did arise a marvellous Schism, and variety of Factions, in Celebrating the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service, and Administring of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56964:53"/>
and other Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church. For some allowed of the King's proceedings; others, dissemblingly, and patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, used some part of them; Many contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them all. Moreover, it is observed in the Register-Book of the Parish of <hi>Petworth,</hi> that many, at this time, affirmed, that the most Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrament of the Altar was of little worth: So that in many places, it was irreverently used, and cast out of the Church; and many other great Enormities committed: Which they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by oppugning the Established Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; as Holy-Water, Holy-Bread, and divers other Rites of the Seven Sacraments. And yet these were not all the mischiefs, which the time produced. For, in pursuance of this Schism, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those, that had been licensed to Preach, appeared as active in Preaching against the King's proceedings, as many of the unlicensed Preachers had been found to be. </p>

                  <p>Upon this it was advised, that a Publick Liturgy should be drawn, and confirmed by Parliament; which was accordingly done. Now, here it is to be observed, that those who had the directing of this Business, were before hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that none but English Heads and Hands should be used therein; lest otherwise it might be thought, and perhaps objected, That they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followed the Example of some other Churches, or were swayed by the Authority of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56964:53"/>
those Forein Assistants, than by the Word of God. Certain it is, that upon the very first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a Reformation here intended <hi>Calvin</hi> had offered his Assistance to Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> as himself confessed. But the Archbishop knew the man, and refused the offer. And it appears in one of Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi>'s Sermons, that there was a report, about this time, of <hi>Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi>'s coming: But it proved only a report. And though it was thought necessary, for the better seasoning of the Universities, in the Protestant Reformed Religion, that <hi>Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> should be invited to come over; yet the Archbishop's Letter of Invitation, sent to <hi>Bucer,</hi> was not written till the 12th of <hi>October;</hi> at which time, the Liturgy, then in hand (being the chief Key of the Work of Reformation) was in a very good forwardness; and must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly finished, before he could so settle, and dispose his affairs in <hi>Germany,</hi> as to come for <hi>England.</hi> And though <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> being either more at leisure, or more willing to accept of the Invitation, came many months before the other, yet neither do we find him here, till the end of <hi>November;</hi> when the Liturgy had been approved of. Nor was it likely, that they would make use of such a man, in Composing a Liturgy, wherein they were resolved to retain a great part of the ancient Ceremonies; who being made Canon of Christ's Church in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and frequently present at Divine Service in that

                  <p>In the first place, (as lying nearest) came in the Free Chappel of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> originally Founded in the Palace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Chappel-Royal of the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The whole Foundation consisted of no fewer, than Thirty eight Persons; to wit, One

Dean, Twelve Canons, Thirteen Vicars, Four Clerks, Six Choristers; besides a Verger, and one that had charge of the Chappel.</p>
                  <p>There was likewise a certain number appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the officiating of the daily Service: <hi>(Gentlemen of the Chappel</hi> they were commonly called.) As for the Chappel it self, together with a Cloyster of curious Workmanship, built by <hi>John Chambers,</hi> one of the Kings Physicians, and the last Master of the same, they are still standing as they were; the Chappel having been since fitted, and employ'd for a <hi>House of Commons,</hi> in all times of Parliament. </p>

               <q>
                  <p>At the same time also fell the College of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> scituated in the City of <hi>London,</hi> not far from <hi>Aldersgate;</hi> first founded for a Dean, and Secular Canons, in the time of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                  <p>This College was surrendred into the Hands of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; who after, gave the same to the Church of <hi>Westminster;</hi> and they, to make the best of the Kings Donation, ordered, That the Body of the Church, with the Quire, and Isles, should be Leased out for Fifty years, excepting out of the said Grant, the Bells, Lead, Stone, Timber, Glass, and Iron, to be sold, and disposed of, for the sole use, and benefit, of the said Dean and Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Which foul Transaction being made, the Church was totally pulled down, a Tavern
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56964:55"/>
built on the East-part of it; the rest of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the said Church, and College, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Precinct thereof, being built upon with several Tenements. But for this Sacriliege, the Church of <hi>Westminster</hi> was called immediately to a sober reckoning. For the Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> thinking it altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, that two Cathedrals should be Founded so near together; and conceiving, that the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> (as being of a late Foundation) might best be spared, had cast a longing Eye upon the goodly Patrimony, which remained unto it. And being then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnish'd of a House, or Palace, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to his Greatness, he doubted not to find room enough, upon the Dissolution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of so large a Fabrick, to raise a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, equal to his vast Designs. Which coming to the Ears of <hi>Benson,</hi> the last Abbot, and first Dean of that Church, he could bethink himself of no other means to preserve the whole, than by parting, for the present, with more than half the Estate, which belonged unto it.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon a Lease is made of <hi>Seventy Mannors</hi> and <hi>good Farms,</hi> lying almost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the County of <hi>Glocester,</hi> for the term of Ninety nine Years; which they presented to the Lord <hi>Thomas Seymour,</hi> to serve as an Addition to his Mannor of <hi>Sudeley;</hi> humbly beseeching him to stand their good Lord and Patron, and to preserve them in a fair esteem with the Lord <hi>Protector.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56964:55"/>
Another Present of almost as many <hi>Mannors,</hi> and <hi>Farms,</hi> lying in the Counties of <hi>Glocester, Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> was made, for the like term, to Sir <hi>John Mason,</hi> a special Confident of the Dukes; not for his own, but for the use of his <hi>Great Master:</hi> which, after the Duke, all came to Sir <hi>John Bourn,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, in the time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet this would not serve the turn, till they had put into the Scale their <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Islip,</hi> conferred upon the Church by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor; to which no fewer, than Two hundred customary Tenants owed their <hi>Soyl</hi> and <hi>Service:</hi> and being one of the best Woody things in these parts of the Realm, was to be granted also, without impeachment of <hi>Wast;</hi> as it was accordingly.</p>
                  <p>By means whereof the <hi>Deanery</hi> was preserv'd for the latter times. How it succeeded with the Bishoprick, we shall see afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Benson</hi> saved the <hi>Deanery;</hi> but he lost himself. For, calling to remembrance, that formerly he had been a means to Surrender the Abbey, and was now forc'd on the necessity of <hi>Dilapidating</hi> the Estate of the <hi>Deanery,</hi> he fell into a great disquiet of Mind, which brought him to his Death, within some Months after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The reason of selecting these two</hi> Free-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels <hi>out of all the rest, was because there was more depending on the story of them, than of any others.</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>THE Protector, intending to Erect a Magnificent Palace, was bought out of his Design of building it on the <hi>Deanery</hi> and Close of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and therefore cast his Eye upon a piece of Ground in the <hi>Strand,</hi> on which stood Three Episcopal Houses, and one Parish-Church: The Parish Church Dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> the Houses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Bishops of <hi>Worcester, Lichfield,</hi> and <hi>Landaff:</hi> All these he takes into his hands; the Owners not daring to oppose, and therefore willingly consenting to it. Having clear'd the place, and finding, that more materials would be wanting, than the demolished Churches, and Houses could afford, he resolv'd to take down the Parish-Church of St. <hi>Margarets</hi> in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56964:57"/>
                     <hi>Westminster,</hi> and to turn the Parishioners, for Celebrating all Divine Offices, into some part of the <hi>Nave,</hi> or main Body of the Abbey Church. But the Work-men had no sooner advanced their Scaffolds, when the Parishioners gathered together in great multitudes, with Bows and Arrows, Staves and Clubs, and other such Weapons; which so terrified the Work-men, that they ran away in great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and never could be brought again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Employment.</p>
                  <p>Upon this he conceiv'd it would be a safer undertaking to fall upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, the Bishop then standing on his good behavior; and the Dean and Chapter of that Church (as of all the rest) being no better, in a manner, (by reason of the last Act of Parliament) than <hi>Tenants at Will</hi> of their great Landlords. And upon this, he employs Work-men, to take down the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, on the North-side of the Church, and a piece of curious Work round about the Cloyster, with a Chappel, that stood in the midst of the Church-yard: also the Charnel-House, that stood upon the South-side of it (now a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-yard) with the Chappel, Timber, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents therein; which were all beaten down, the Bones of the Dead carried into <hi>Finsbury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> and the Stones converted to this Building, and the vacant places filled up afterwards with Dwelling-Houses. Moreover, the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> near <hi>Smith-field,</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56964:57"/>
and blown up with Gunpowder, and the Stones applied to this Spacious Building.</p>
                  <p>Likewise <hi>Barking</hi> Chappel, near the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the College-Church of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins le Grand,</hi> nigh the Shambles, and St. <hi>Ewens</hi> within <hi>Newgate;</hi> also the Parish-Church of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the Shambles, were pulled quite down. Such was the Ground, and such the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of the Dukes new Palace, called <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-House.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> concerning this Example given of pulling down of Churches.</p>
                  <p>According to this beginning all the year pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; in which there was nothing to be found, but Troubles, Commotions, and Disquiets, both in Church and State. For about this time, there started up a Sect of Men, that were nam'd <hi>Gospellers;</hi> who asserted the Blasphemous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> of <hi>Gods being the Author of Sin.</hi> And, at the same time, the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who had kept themselves unto themselves, in the late King's time, began to look abroad, and disperse their Dotages.</p>
                  <p>For the prevention of which mischief, before it grew to a Head, some of the chief of them were Convented in the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Archbishop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> who in Examining them, took up his Seat upon an Altar of our Lady.</p>
                  <p>These Men, being convicted of their Errors, some of them were dismissed only with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; others condemn'd to bear their Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots at St. <hi>Pauls-Cross. </hi>

Now the time draws on for the putting forth the new Liturgy; which differed little in the main (no not so much as in the Canon of the Mass) from the Latin Service. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Publishing, and Commanding the use of this Book, yet many did Celebrate their Private Masses, in such secret places, that it was not easie to discover them. More confidently carried in the Church of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> in many Chappels whereof, by the Bishops Sufferance, the former Masses were kept up; that is to say, Our Ladies Mass, the Apostles Mass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Latin, but disguis'd with <hi>English</hi> names, of the Apostles Communion, and our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Communion.

               <q>
                  <p>UPon the Imposition of this Book, and a new Form of Religion obtruded, many Counties took up Arms to oppose it. But yet so, that they were presently ready to lay down, if the King would grant them some few De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; whereof one was this, to wit, </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">That for as much as we constantly believe, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Priest hath spoken the words of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, being at Mass, there is very really the Body and Blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ, God and Man; And that no Substance of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56964:58"/>
Bread and Wine remains after, but the very self same Body, that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was given, upon the Cross, for our Redemption; therefore we desire to have Mass celebrated as it was in times past: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we find, that many presume unworthily to receive the same; putting no difference between our Lords Body, and other kind of Meat: Some saying, That it is Bread, both before and after Consecration: And some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain say, that it is profitable to no man, unless he receives it; with many other abused terms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we desire, that Curates may Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Baptism at all times of necessity, as well upon Week-days, as Holy-days.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Children may be Confirm'd by the Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That there may be <hi>Holy-Bread,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Water,</hi> in remembrance of Christ's precious Body and Blood.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That our Lord's Body be reserv'd in Churches.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That Priests may live unmarried.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That the <hi>Six Articles,</hi> set forth by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth may be continued; at least till the King comes to full Age.</p>
                  <p>They further made this Remonstrance, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Free-born Commonalty was oppress'd by a small number of Gentry, who glutted themselves with Pleasures, whilst poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, wasted with daily Labor, did, (like
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56964:59"/>
Pack-horses) live in extreme slavery. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That Holy Rites, establish'd by Antiquity, were abolished, and new ones Authoriz'd, with a new Form of Religion obtruded, to the subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Souls to those horrid pains, which no death could terminate. And therefore, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they declar'd, That they thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and convenient, to have new Counsellors plac'd about the King, during his Minority; with the removing of those, who Ruling as they list, confounded things Sacred and Profane, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding nothing, but the enriching themselves with the Publick Treasure, that they might riot it amongst those Publick Calamities.</p>

               <p>But these Men were soon suppressed, and the Changes went on. As appears by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation of Dr <hi>Heylyn,</hi> pag. 79.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But then there started up another Faction, as dangerous to the Church, as opposite to the Publick Liturgy, and as destructive of the Rules of Reformation, then by Law establish'd as were those of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Archbishop, and the rest of the Prelates, having so far proceeded in abolishing the Religion, and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> resolv'd, in the next place, to go forwards, with a further Reformation, in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point of Doctrine, concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In order whereunto <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s coming was expected in the year before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56964:59"/>
But he came not then; and therefore Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were directed by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop to <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <note place="margin">The bringing in of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into this Nation.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who were more addicted to the <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> than the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrines, in the Point of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martyr,</hi> coming over, was made the King's Professor of <hi>Divinity</hi> at <hi>Oxford:</hi> and about two years after, made Canon of <hi>Christ's-</hi>Church. In his first Lectures, he is said, by <hi>Saunders,</hi> (if he may be credited) to have declared himself so much a <hi>Zuinglian</hi> in the Point, as to give great offence to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the rest of the Bishops: But afterwards, upon notice of it, to have been more moderate, and to conform his judgment to the sense of the Prelates.</p>
                  <p>But however it were, it is certain, that his <hi>Readings</hi> were so much disliked by some of the University, that a publick Disputation was shortly had, betwixt him, and some of those, who disliked his doings: in which he publickly maintained these Two Propositions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Substance of the Bread and Wine was not changed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Body, and Blood of Christ, was not carnally, and bodily, in the Bread, and Wine; but united unto them Sacramentally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Disputation was ended, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the open Schools, That <hi>Martyr</hi> had the upper hand, and had sufficiently answered all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56964:60"/>
Arguments. But <hi>Chadsey,</hi> the chief of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, and the rest of those, that Disputed with him, acknowledged no such Satisfaction to be given unto them; their Party noising it abroad, that they had the Victory.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Bucer</hi> not coming over at the same time was earnestly invited by the Archbishop's Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; upon which he came, and presently writ to <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> Being now settled here, he receives Letters from <hi>Calvin;</hi> by which he was advised to take heed of his old fault, and to run a moderate course in his Reformations.</p>
                  <p>The first thing, that he did at his coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was to make himself acquainted with the <hi>English Liturgy.</hi> Of this he gives account to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and desires some Letters from him to the Lord Protector, (with whom <hi>Calvin</hi> had already began to tamper) that he migh: find the greater Favor from him.</p>
                  <p>He was sent to take a Chair at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where his first <hi>Readings</hi> gave no such distast, as to put him to the necessity of Challenging the Dissenters to a Disputation; though in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Form a Disputation was there held, at his first coming thither, concerning <hi>the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Holy Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Fallibility of the Church,</hi> and the true nature of <hi>Justification.</hi> But long he had not held the place, when he left this life.</p>
                  <p>Yet so it was, that the Account which he had given to <hi>Calvin</hi> of the English Liturgy, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56964:60"/>
his desiring of a Letter from him to the Lord Protector, proved the occasion of much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Church, and the Orders of it. For <hi>Calvin,</hi> not forgetting the repulse he found at the hands of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> when he first offered his assistance, had skrewed himself into the Favor of the Lord Protector. And thinking nothing to be well done, which either was not done by him, or by his direction, (as appears by his Letters to all Princes, that did but cast an eye, towards a Reformation) must needs be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in such matters, as belonged not to him.</p>
                  <p>He therefore writes a very long Letter to the Lord Protector; in which, approving well enough of <hi>Set Forms</hi> of Prayer, he descends more particularly to the English Liturgy; in canvasing whereof, he there excepted against <hi>Commemoration of the Dead,</hi> (which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges however to be very ancient) as also against <hi>Chrism,</hi> and <hi>Extreme Unction:</hi> the last whereof being rather allowed of, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Rules of the Book.</p>
                  <p>Which said, he makes it his advice, That all these Ceremonies should be abrogated; and that withal he should go forward, to Reform the Church without Fear, or Wit; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Peace at home, or Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency abroad; such considerations being only to be had in <hi>Civil Matters,</hi> but not in Matters of the Church; wherein nothing is to be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which is not warranted by the Word, and in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56964:61"/>
the managing whereof, there is not any thing more distastful in the eyes of God, than <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisdom,</hi> either in moderating, cutting off, or going backwards, but meerly as we are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his <hi>Revealed Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place he gives a touch upon the <hi>Book of Homilies.</hi> These, very faintly, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits for some time only; but by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of them for any long continuance, or to be looked on as a Rule of the Church, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to serve for the Instruction of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and thereby gave a hint to the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers, who ever since almost have dec aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas some Disputes had grown (by his setting on, or the pragmatical Humor of some Agents, which he had amongst us), about the Ceremonies of the Church then by Law Established; he must needs trouble the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in that business also: to whom he writes to this effect. <hi rend="margQuotes">That the <hi>Papists</hi> would grow insolenter every day, unless the Differences were composed about the Ceremonies.</hi> But how? Not by reducing the Opponents to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, but by encouraging them rather in their opposition: Which cannot but appear most plainly to be all he aimed at, by soliciting the Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi> in behalf of <hi>Hooper,</hi> who was then faln into some trouble upon that account.</p>

This <hi>Hooper,</hi> being designed Bishop of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> the Archbishop would not Consecrate him, but in such Habit, as Bishops are requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wear by the Rules of the Church; but he refused to take it upon such conditions. And repairing to his Patron, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> he obtains a Letter to the Archbishop, <hi>desiring a forbearance of those things;</hi> implying also, that it was the King's desire, as well as his, that such forbearance should be used. It was desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also, that he <hi>would not charge him with any Oath, which seemed to be burdensome to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> For the Elect Bishop as it seems, had boggled also at the Oath of paying <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to his Metropolitan. The King likewise writ to the Archbishop to the same effect. At last the business was thus composed; to wit, That <hi>Hooper</hi> should receive his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration; attired in his Episcopal Robes: but that he should be dispensed withal from wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, at ordinary times, as his daily Habit, but that he should be bound to use it, whensoever he Preached before the King. <hi>Fox</hi> reproacheshim for giving any way to wear this Popish Attire; and makes it to be a great cause of shame, and contumely to him. And possibly it might be thought so at that time, by <hi>Hooper</hi> himself, who ever after hated Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> the principal Man, that held him up so closely to such hard conditions. </p>

                  <p>Thus we have the first beginning of that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which hath continued ever since, against the Liturgy it self, the Cap, and Surplice, and other Rites, and Usages of the English Church. And these were the Effects of <hi>Calvins</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing in behalf of <hi>Hooper.</hi> For what did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon, but a continual multiplying of Disorders in all parts of this Church? The sitting at the Sacrament used, and maintain'd by <hi>John a Lasco,</hi> first caused Irreverence in the Receiving, and afterwards a Contempt, and Depraving of it. The crying down of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Vestments, and the Grave Habit of the Clergy, first occasioned a dis-esteem of the Men themselves, and by degrees a vilifying, and contempt of their Calling. Nay such a <hi>peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of Humor began then manifestly to break out, that it was Preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, by a Curate of St. <hi>Catherines Christ-Church,</hi> That it was fit, the Names of Churches should be altered, and the Names of the Days in the Week changed. That Fish-days should be kept on any other days, than <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and the <hi>Lent</hi> at any other time, except only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Shrove-tide</hi> and <hi>Easter.</hi> We are told also by <hi>John Stow,</hi> that he had seen this Curate of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> to leave the Pulpit, and Preach to the People out of an High Elm, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56964:63"/>
stood in the midst of the Church-Yard; and that being done, to return into the Church again, and leaving the High Altar, to sing the Communion-Service upon a Tomb of the Dead, with his face toward the North. Which is to be observed the rather, because this Curate hath found so many followers in these latter times.</p>
                  <p>For, as some of the Preciser sort have of late left the Church, to Preach in Woods, and Barns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in stead of the old Days, and Months, can find no other Title for them, than the First, Second, or Third Month of the Year; and so of the Days of the Week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So was it propounded, not long since, by some State Reformers, That the Fast of <hi>Lent</hi> should be kept no longer between <hi>Shrove-tide</hi> and <hi>Easter,</hi> but rather (by some Act, or Ordinance, made for that purpose) betwixt <hi>Easter,</hi> and <hi>Whitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide.</hi> To such wild Fancies do Men grow, when once they break those Bounds, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect those Rules, which wise Antiquity ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Preservation of Peace, and Order. </p>

                  <p>If it be asked, What in the mean time was become of Bishops, and why no care was taken for the Purging those peccant Humors? It may be answered, That the Wings of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had been so clipped, that it was scarce able to fly abroad: The Sentence of <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> not having been in use, since the first of this King. Whether it were, that Command
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56964:63"/>
was laid upon the Bishops, by which they were restrained from the Exercise of it; or that some other course was in agitation, for drawing the Cognizance of all Ecclesiastical causes to the Court of <hi>Westminster;</hi> or, that it was thought inconsistent with that <hi>dreadful Sentence,</hi> to be issued in the King's Name, (as it had been lately appointed by Act of Parliament) it is not casie to determine. But certain it is, that at this time it was either abolished for the present, or of no effect; not only to the cherishing of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders amongst the Ministers of the Church, but to the great encrease of viciousness in all sorts of men. <hi rend="margQuotes">Lechery <hi>(saith Bishop</hi> Latimer) is used in <hi>England,</hi> and such Lechery, as is used in no other part of the World. And it is made a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sport, a matter of nothing, a laughing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Trifle not to be regarded, not to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Peter Martyr</hi> much bemoans the miserable condition of the Church, for want of Preachers.</p>

                     <p>But the great business this year, was the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of Altars. The Principal Motive where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was the Opinion of some dislikes which had been taken by <hi>Calvin</hi> against the Liturgy; and the desire of those of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Faction to reduce this Church unto the Nakedness, and Simplicity of those Transmarine Churches, which followed the <hi>Helvetian,</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi>

                  <head>Reasons given for the taking down of Altars.</head>
                  <q>
                     <p>The Reasons, that were given for the doing of this, were these: First, To <hi>with-draw the People from the Opinion of the Mass, to the right use of the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper:</hi> The use of an Altar being to Sacrifice upon, and the use of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eat upon: And therefore a Table to be far more fit for our feeding on him; who was once only crucified, and offered for us. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That in the Book of Common-Prayer, the name of <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Board,</hi> and <hi>Table,</hi> are used indifferently, without Prescribing any thing in the form thereof. For as it is called a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56964:64"/>
                        <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Board,</hi> in reference to the Lord's Supper; so it is called an <hi>Altar</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in reference to the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving: And so, that the changing of Altars into Tables, was no way repugnant to the Rules of the Liturgy. Thirdly, That Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were erected for the Sacrifices of the Law; which being now ceased, the Form of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was to cease together with them. Fourthly, That as Christ did Institute the Sacrament of his Body and Blood at a Table, and not at an Altar; so it is not to be found, that any of the Apostles did ever use an Altar in the Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And finally, That it is declared in the Preface to the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> That if any Doubt arise in the use and practising of the said Book, that then, to appease all such diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, the matter shall be referred unto the Bishop of the Diocess; who, by his discretion shall take order for the quieting of it.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>But the taking down of Altars being Decreed, and Commanded, a question afterwards did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, about the Form of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Board,</hi> some using it in the form of a <hi>Table,</hi> and some in the form of an <hi>Altar. Ridley,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> determined it for the form of a <hi>Table,</hi> to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all memory of the Mass: And upon this, caused the Wall standing on the back-side of the Altar in the Church of St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> to be brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down, for an example to the rest. But yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56964:65"/>
there followed no universal change of Altars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tables, in all parts of the Realm, till the repealing of the first Liturgy; in which the Priest is appointed to <hi>stand before the midst of the Altar, in the Celebration,</hi> and the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Second; in which it is required, That <hi>the Priest shall stand on the North-side of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> which put an end to the Dispute.</p>

                  <p>NOthing as yet had been concluded po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively, and dogmatically, in Points, of Doctrine, but as they were to be collected from the Homilies, and the Publick Liturgy; and those but few, in reference to the many Controversies which were to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against the Sectaries of that Age: Many Disorders having grown up in this little time, in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56964:65"/>
officiating the Liturgy, the Vestures of the Church, and the Habit of Church-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Calvin,</hi> prosecuted by <hi>Hooper,</hi> and countenanced by the large Immunities granted to <hi>John a Lasco,</hi> and his Church of Strangers. And unto these, the change of Altars into Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, gave no small encrease; as well by reason of some differences, which grew amongst the Ministers themselves upon that occasion; as in regard of the irreverence which it bred in the People; to whom it made the Sacrament to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear less venerable, than before it did.</p>
                  <p>The People had been so long accustomed to receive the Sacrament upon their knees, that no Rule, nor Canon, was thought necessary to keep them to it. But the change of Altars into Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the practise of the Church of Strangers, and <hi>John a Lasco</hi>'s Book, in maintenance of Sitting at the Holy Table, made many think that posture best, which was so much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced. And what was like to follow upon such a Liberty, (the proneness of those times to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodoxies, and Profaneness considered) gave just cause to fear.</p>
                  <p>Something therefore were to be done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that mischief; and nothing could prevent it better, than to reduce the People to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Custom, by some <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Rubrick,</hi> by which they should be bound to receive it kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So for the Ministers themselves, they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be as much at a loss in their Officiating at
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56964:66"/>
the Table, as the People were in their irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to the Blessed Sacrament: Which cannot be better expressed, than in the words of some Romish Prelates, who objected it unto some of our chief Reformers. Thus <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi> charges it upon bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> saying, <hi>That when their Table was constituted, they could never be content in placing of it, now East, now North, now one way, now another, until it pleased God, of his Goodness, to place it quite out of the Church.</hi> The like was <hi>Weston</hi> (the Prolocutor of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, in the First of Queen <hi>Mary)</hi> in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation held with <hi>Latimer;</hi> telling him, with reproach and contempt, That <hi>the Protestants having turned their Table, were like a company of Apes, that knew not which way to turn their Tayls; looking one day East, and another West one this way, and another that way, as their fancies lead them.</hi> Thus finally, one <hi>Miles Hubbard,</hi> in a Book called, <hi>The Display of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> reports the business. <hi>How long</hi> (says he) <hi>were they learning to set their Tables, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Communion upon? First, they placed it aloft, where the High Altar stood: Then must it be removed from the Wall, that one might go between; the Ministers being in contention, on whether part to turn their faces, either toward the West, the North, or South. Some would stand Westward, some Northward, some Southward.</hi> To take away these Disorders, which gave great Scandal to many moderate, and well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56964:66"/>
meaning Men, a <hi>Rubrick</hi> was resolv'd on; by which the Minister that Officiated, should be pointed to a certain place; and by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> then devis'd, the North-side was thought fitter, than any other.</p>

                  <p>BUt the main matters, which were now brought into Consideration, were the Reviewing of the Liturgy, and the Composing of a Book of Articles.

To which end, as he had formerly applied himself to the Protector, so now he sets upon the King, the Council, and the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in hope to bring them to his bent. In his Letters to the King and Council (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self signified to <hi>Bullinger,</hi> on the 29th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust)</hi> he excites them to proceed to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is to say, to such a Reformation as he had projected, and without which his Followers would not be contented.</p>
                  <p>In his Letters to the King alone, he lets him know, that many things were still amiss in the State of the Kingdom, which stood in need of Reformation. And finally, in those to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> he certifies him, that in the Service of this Church, as then it stood, there remained a <hi>whole mass of Popery;</hi> which did not only <hi>darken,</hi> but <hi>destroy</hi> Gods Holy Worship. Moreover, he had his Agents in the Court, the Country, and the Universities, by whom he drives on his Design, on all parts at once. And so far he prevail'd in the first Two years, that in the Convocation, which began in the former year, the first Debate amongst the Prelates was of <hi>such Doubts,</hi> as had arisen, about some things contain'd, in the Common-Prayer-Book, and more particularly touching such Feasts, as were retain'd, and such as had been abrogated by the Rules thereof; the form of words used at the giving of the Bread, and the different manner of Administring the Holy Sacrament: which being signified to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56964:67"/>
Prolocutor, and the rest of the Clergy, (who had receiv'd somewhat in charge about it the day before,) Answer was made, that they had not yet sufficiently considered of the Points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; but that they would give their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships some account thereof in their following Session. But what account was given, doth not appear: only this is certain, that upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, there was a New Book of Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er set forth.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>for the avoiding of diversities of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and establishing consent touching true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> it was thought necessary, to Compose a Book of Articles, in which should be contain'd the <hi>Common Principles</hi> of the Christian Faith, in which all Parties did agree, together with the most Points, in which they differed. For the better performing of which Work, <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s Company, and Assistance had been long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                  <p>That he held Correspondence with the King, and Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> appears by his Epistles of the year, 1549, 1550, 1551. But, that he came not over, as was expected, must be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either to our Home-bred troubles, or the great Sickness of this year, or the Death of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> upon whom he did most rely. But though <hi>Erasmus</hi> was dead, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> absent, yet were they to be found, both alive, and present in their Writings.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56964:68"/>
the Composers of those Articles were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Cranmer</hi> had a great hand in composing of them, is not to be doubted; who therefore takes upon himself, as the <hi>Author</hi> of them, and is to be look'd upon, as the principal <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect;</hi> who contriv'd the Building, and gave, the inferior Workmen, their several Parts, and Offices, in that employment.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56964:69"/>
and the Communion-Table was plac'd in the lower part of the Quire, where the <hi>Priest sang</hi> the <hi>Daily Service.</hi> What hereupon ensued of the <hi>rich Ornaments,</hi> and <hi>Plate,</hi> wherewith eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Church</hi> was furnish'd, after its proportion, we shall see shortly, when the Kings Commissioners shall be sent abroad to seize upon them, in his Name, for their own Commodity.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in English Meeter, by <hi>John Hopkins,</hi> following the Example of <hi>Beza,</hi> who translated them, to be fitted unto several Tunes; which hereupon began to be sung in private Houses, and by degrees, to be taken up in all Churches of the <hi>French,</hi> and other Nations, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the <hi>Genevian</hi> Platform. <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition likewise, (although it was full of Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Botching), yet notwithstanding was first allowed for private Devotion, and by little and little brought into the use of the Church, allowed to be sung before, and after Morning and Evening-Prayer, and also before, and after Sermons: afterwards Printed, and bound up with the Common-Prayer-Book, and at last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the end of the Bible. But in some tract of time, as the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction grew in strength and confidence, it prevailed so far in most places, as to thrust the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and the <hi>Nunc Dimittis,</hi> quite out of the Church.</p>

                  <p>Such was the Rapacity of the Times, and the unfortunateness of the Kings conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his Minority was abused to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acts of Spoyl and Rapine, (even to the high degree of Sacrilege) to the raising of some, and enriching of others, without any manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to his own Estate. For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the great, and almost inestimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; which must needs come in, by the spoyl of so many <hi>Shrines,</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> the Sale of the <hi>Lands,</hi> belonging to <hi>Chantries, Colleges, Free-Chappels, &amp;c.</hi> and the Dilapidating of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony</hi> of so many <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> and <hi>Cathedral Churches;</hi> he was nevertheless, not only plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Debr, but the Crown-lands are much diminish'd, and empair'd, since his coming to it. Besides which spoyls, there were many
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56964:70"/>
other helps, and some great ones too, of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him before-hand, and full of Money, had they been used to his Advantage.</p>
                  <p>The Lands of divers of the Halls, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>London,</hi> were charged with Annual Pensions, for the finding of such Lights, Obits, and Chantry-Priests, as were Founded by the Donors of them. For the redeeming whereof, they were constrained to pay the Sum of Twenty thousand Pounds, to the use of the King. Other vast Sums likewise came to him upon several ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; yet notwithstanding all this, he is now found to be much over-whelmed with Debt. It must now be his care, and the endeavors of those, who plunged him into it, to find the speediest way for his getting out. In order to which, the main Engin, at this time, for the advancing Money, was the Speeding of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, into all parts of the Realm, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of selling such of the Lands, and Goods, of Chantries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that remained unfold; but, in plain truth, it was, to seize upon all Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Altar-Cloths, Fronts, Parafronts, Copes of all sorts, with all manner of Plate, Jewels, Bells, and Ornaments, which were to be found in any Cathedral, or Parochial Church: to which rapacity, the demolishing of the former Altars, and placing the Communion. Table in the middle of the Quires, or Chancels, of every Church, (as was then most used), gave a very great hint, by rendring all such Furniture, rich
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56964:70"/>
Plate, and other costly Utensils, in a manner useless. And that the business might be carried on with as much advantage to the King, as might be, he gave out certain Instructions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, by which the Commissioners were to regulate themselves in their proceedings, to the advancement of the Service.</p>
                  <p>Now we cannot doubt, but they were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and exact, in the execution: which cannot be better discerned than by that, which is reported of their doings in all parts of the Realm; and more particularly in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> more richly furnished by reason of the Pomps of Coronations, Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and such like Solemnities, than any other in the Kingdom. Unto this Church they left no more then two Cups, with covers, all gilt; one white Silver Pot, three Hearse-Cloths, twelve Cushions, one Carpet for the Table, eight Stall-Cloths for the Quire, three Pulpit-Cloths, nine little Carpets for the Dean's Stall, two Table-Cloths. The rest of all the rich Furniture, Massy Plate, and whatsoever else was of any value (which questionless must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a very great Sum) was seized on by the said Commissioners. The like was done generally in all other parts of the Realm.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this great care of the King on the one side, and the double diligence of his Commissioners on the other, the Booty did not prove so great as was expected. In all great
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56964:71"/>
Fairs and Markets there are some fore-stallers, who get the best penny-worths to themselves, and suffer not the richest, and most gainful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be openly sold. And so it was here: For there were some, who were as much before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with the Commissioners, in Embezzelling the said Plate, Jewels, and other Furniture, as the Commissioners did intend to be with the King, in keeping always most part of it unto themselves. For when the Commissioners came to execute their Powers in their several Circuits, they neither could discover All, or recover much of that, which had been made away: Some things being utterly embezzelled by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not responsible: in which case the King, as well as the Commissioners, was to lose his Right. But more was concealed by Persons not to be discovered; who had so cunningly carried on the stealth, that there was no tracing of their Foot-steps. And some there were, who being known to have such Goods in their Possession, conceived themselves to be <hi>too great</hi> to be called in question, and were connived at willingly by those, that were but their equals, and either were, or meant to be Offenders in the same kind. So that although some profit was hereby raised to the King's Exchequer, yet the far greatest part of the Prey came to other hands. Insomuch, that many private Mens Parlors were hung with Altar-cloths, their Tables and Beds cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Copes, instead of Carpets, and Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56964:71"/>
and many made Carowsing Cups of the Sacred Chalice, as once <hi>Belshazzar</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated his drunken Feasts in the Sanctified Vessels of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>It was a sorry House, not worth the naming, which had not something of this Furniture in it, though it were only a fair large Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made of a Cope, or Altar-cloth, to adorn their Windows, or to make their Chairs appear to have somewhat in them of a Chair of State.</p>
                  <p>Yet how contemptible were these Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, in comparrison of those vast Sums of Money, which were made of Jewels, Plate, and Cloth of Tissue; either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed beyond the Seas, or sold at home, and good Lands purchased with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; nothing the more blessed to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of them that bought them, for being purchased with the Consecrated Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of so many Churches.</p>

                  <p>BUt as the King was plunged in Debt, without being put to any extraordinary Charges; so was he decayed in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, without selling any part of his Crown Lands, toward the payment of it. By the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of some, and the Surrendring of other Religious Houses, the <hi>Royal Intrado</hi> was so much encreased in the late King's time, that for the better managing of it, the King Erected, first <hi>the Court of Augmentation.</hi> and afterwards, <hi>the Court of Surveyors.</hi> But in short time, by his own profuseness, and the avariciousness of this King's Ministers, it was so retrenched, that it was scarce able to find work enough for the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Exchequer.</hi> Whereupon followed the Dissolving of the said Two Courts in the last Parliament of this King: Which as it made a loud noise in the ears of the People, so did it put
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56964:72"/>
this jealousie into their minds, That if the King's Lands should be thus daily wasted without any recruit, he must at last prove burthensome to the common Subject. Some course is therefore to be thought on, which might pretend to an encrease of the King's Revenue: And none more easie to be compassed, than to begin with the Suppression of such Bishopricks, and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate Churches, as either lay farthest off, or might be best spared.</p>
                  <p>In reference whereunto, it was concluded, in a Chapter held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by the Knights of the Garter, That from thenceforth the said most Noble Order of the Garter, should be no longer entituled by the Name of St. <hi>George,</hi> but that it should be called, The <hi>Order of the Garter</hi> only; and the Feast of the said Order should be Celebrated upon <hi>Whitsun-Eve, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sun-Day,</hi> and <hi>Whitsun-Munday,</hi> and not on St. <hi>George</hi>'s-day, as before it was. And to what end was this concluded, and what else was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon this Conclusion, but the Dissolving of the Free-Chappel of St. <hi>George</hi> in the Castle of <hi>Windsor;</hi> and the transferring of the Order, to the Chappel of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in the Abbey of <hi>Westminster:</hi> Which had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly been done, and all the Lands thereof converted to some powerful Courtiers, (under pretence of laying them to the Crown) if the King's death, (which happened within Four months after) had not prevented the design, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56964:73"/>
thereby respited that ruine, which was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>The like preservation hapned, at the same time, to the Church of <hi>Durham,</hi> as liberally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed as the most, and more amply privil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eged, than the best in the King's Dominions: The Bishops thereof by Charter, and long Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enjoying and exercising, all the Rights of a County Palatine, in that large Tract of Ground, which lies between the <hi>Tees</hi> and the <hi>Tyne;</hi> the Diocess also containing all <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi> of which the Bishops, and the Priests, had the greatest shares. No sooner was Bishop <hi>Tonstal</hi> committed to the Tower, but presently an eye was cast upon his Possessions: Which questionless had followed the same fortune with the rest of the Bishopricks, if one, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the rest, had not preserved it from being parcelled out, as the others were, on a strong confidence of getting it all unto himself.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> to preserve himself, gave unto the King, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of his Inheritance; and dying without Children, not long after, left his Titles also to the King's disposing. The Lands, and Titles, being thus fallen unto the Crown, continued undisposed of till the Fall of the Duke of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset;</hi> when <hi>Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> being created Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> doubted not but he should be able to possess himself, in short time also, of all the Lands of that Family. To
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56964:73"/>
which Estate the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and all the Lands belonging to it, would make a fair Addition: upon which grounds the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Durham,</hi> being Dissolved by Act of Parliament, under pretence of patching up the King's Revenue, the greatest part of the Lands thereof were kept together, that they might serve for a Revenue to the future Palatine.</p>
                  <p>But all these Projects failed in the Death of the King, and the subsequent Death of this great Duke, in the following Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>

                  <p>THe Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> having procured the cutting off the <hi>Proctor</hi>'s Head, and being placed next the King, had now gone a great way in his Design: It
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56964:74"/>
only remaining to perswade King <hi>Edward</hi> to exclude his <hi>two Sisters</hi> from <hi>Succession</hi> in the Crown. For, that done, his Daughter-in-law, the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> would come to have <hi>Right:</hi> for, as to Pretenders out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any other, he made no great matter.</p>
                  <p>And now to work the King to this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, being in a languishing Condition, not far from Death) he inculcates to him, how much it concerned him, to have a care of Religion, that it might be preserved in Purity, not only in his own Life, but also after his Death: which would not be, if his Sister, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> should Succeed; and She could not be put by, unless the other Sister, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were put by also; seeing <hi>their Rights</hi> depended one upon another. But if he pleased to Appoint the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s eldest Daughter, and his own next Kinswoman to his Sisters, to be his <hi>Successor,</hi> he might then be sure, that the <hi>True Religion</hi> should be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to God's great Glory; and be a worthy Act of his Religious Prudence.</p>
                  <p>This was to strike upon the right string of the young King's Affections; with whom nothing was so dear, as Preservation of Religion: And thereupon his <hi>Last Will</hi> was appointed to be drawn, (contrived chiefly by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Mountague,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Cecil):</hi> By which <hi>Will,</hi> as far as in him lay, he excluded his <hi>Two Sisters</hi> from the <hi>Succession,</hi> and all others,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56964:74"/>
but the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s Daughters: And then causing it to be read before his Council, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them all <hi>to Assent</hi> unto it, and to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their Hands: which they All, both <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> did; only the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, <hi>Cranmer,</hi> refused at first; Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> a Judge of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> to the last; and with them also Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Will</hi> being thus made, he shortly after dies; conceived to have been Poysoned. It is noted by some (saith Sir <hi>Richard Baker)</hi> That he died the same Month, and the day of the Month, that his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, had put Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> to death. <hi>Thus of this Duke, and the Kings Death.</hi>

               <p>We will now give an Account of the Years when these changes were made.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>IN the First year, a Reformation was resolved on: and to prepare the way for it, <hi>Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were set out, and <hi>Commissioners</hi> sent into all parts of the Kingdom, to enquire into all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Concernments. With them also were sent Preachers; to disswade the People from their former practices in Religion. And this to prepare the way, for the total Alteration in Religion, which was intended. There was likewise a Parliament called, to promote, and confirm the same Designs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:56964:75"/>
In the Second year, Images were taken down, and many Ancient Customs abolished; and a Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> composed. All Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, Hospitals, &amp;c. were given to the King.</p>
                  <p>In the Third year, a part of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and many Churches, were pulled down, to build <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset House</hi> in the <hi>Strand.</hi> There were great Troubles and Commotions, both in Church, and State. The Book of Common-Prayer, composed in the former year, was now set out. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> came over.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth year, one <hi>John a Lasco,</hi> a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi> with his Sectaries, settled themselves here.</p>
                  <p>The great business of this year, was the taking down of Altars.</p>
                  <p>Until this following Fifth year, nothing had been Positively, and Dogmatically concluded in Points of Doctrine. Wherefore to set a stop to the great Confusions, that were at this time, there was a Book of Articles composed. And to satisfie the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> ther was a New Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> set forth.</p>
                  <p>In the Sixth year, <hi>Hopkins</hi> Psalms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be sung in Churches: And the use of the New <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> made strange Alterations; but all in order to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s designs: who had a chief hand in composing it.</p>

For the rest, I commend unto you, <hi>Mary,</hi> our Daughter, beseeching you, to be a good Father unto her; as I have heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. I must entreat you also to consider my Maids, and give them in Marriage; which is not much, they being but Three: And to grant unto all my other Servants, a years pay, besides their due; lest otherwise they should be unprovided for. Lastly, I make this Vow, <hi>That my Eyes have desired you above All Things.</hi>

                  <p>By satisfying the King, her Father, in a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage sent unto her, She gained so far upon him, that from that time forwards, he held her in the same rank, with the rest of his Children, gave Her, her Turn in the Succession of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, assigned Her a Portion of Ten thousand pounds, to be paid at her Marriage; and in the <hi>interim,</hi> Three Thousand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> for Her personal maintenance.</p>

But I am very well assured, That the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Laws were allowed, and consented to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Compulsion, by the whole Realm, both</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>and</hi> Temporal; <hi>and all the Executors Sworn upon a Book, to fulfil the same; so that it was an Authorized Law.

And what fruits daily grow by such Changes, since the death of the King, my Father, it well appears to every indifferent Person; both to the Displeasure of God, and Unquietness of the Realm.</hi>

And if any judge of me the contrary, for my Opinions sake, (as I trust none does) I doubt not in the end, with God's help, to prove my self as True a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Humble Sister, as they of the contrary Opinion, with all their devices and altering the Laws, shall prove themselves good Subjects.</hi>

                  <p>But notwithstanding this Letter, no favor was to be hoped for from these Lords: They signifying unto her, how sensible they were of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56964:79"/>
those Inconveniences, which the Example of her Inconformity to the Laws Established, was likely to produce, amongst the rest of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And hereupon the Lord Chancellor, and Secretary <hi>Peters,</hi> were sent to her; who, after some Conferences, brought her to the King at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Council declared unto her, how long the King had permitted her the use of <hi>Mass;</hi> and considering her Obstinacy, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved now no longer to permit it, unless She would put Him in hope of some Conformity in time. To which She answered, That <hi>her Soul was God's;</hi> and <hi>touching her Faith, as she could not change, so she would not dissemble it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply was made, That the King intended not to constrain her Faith, but to restrain the outward profession of it, in regard of the danger the Example might draw.</p>
                  <p>After some like enterchanges of speeches, the Lady was appointed to remain with the King: When there arrived an Embassador from the <hi>Emperor,</hi> with a threatning Message of War, in case his Cosin, <hi>the Lady Mary,</hi> should be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Free Exercise of <hi>Mass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the King presently advised with the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and with the Bishops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester:</hi> Who gave their Opinion, that to give licence to sin, was sin: But to connive at sin might be allowed, so it were not too long, nor without hope of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56964:79"/>
Then Answer was given to the Embassador, That the King would send to the Emperor within a Month or Two, and give him such Satisfaction, as should be fit.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Earnest Soliciation of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> it was declared unto her by the King, with the consent of his Council, That for his sake, and her own also, it should be suffered, and winked at if she had the private Mass used, in her own Closet, for a season, until she might be better informed: But so, that none, but some few of her own Chamber, should be present with her: And that to all the rest of her House-hold, the Service of the Church should be only used.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Mallet,</hi> and <hi>Barkeley,</hi> Two of her Chaplains, saying Mass promiscuously, in her absence, to her houshold-Servants, were seized on, and committed Prisoners: Which first occasioned an exchange of Letters betwixt her and the King; and afterwards more frequently between her, and the Council.</p>

Moreover, the declaration of the said Promise, was made to me by the Emperor's Embassador that dead is (by his Majesties order) to put my Chaplains more out of fear. When I was the last year with the King's Majesty, my Brother, that question was then moved, and could not be denied, but was affirmed by some of you, before his Majesty, to be true, now I am not so much unquieted for the trouble of my said Chaplains, as, I am, to think how this matter may be taken, the Promise to such a Person being no better regarded: and, for mine own part, I thought full little to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such unkindness at your hands, having always (God is my Judge) wished, unto the whole number of you, as to myself, and have refused to trouble you, or to crave any thing at your bands, but your good will, and friendship, which very slenderly appeareth in this matter.

I am not without some hope, that ye will stay this matter; not inforcing the rigor of the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Chaplains. The one of them was not in my House these Four Months; and Dr.</hi> Mallet, <hi>having my Licence, is either at</hi> Windsor, <hi>or at his Benefice, who, (as I have heard) was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for saying of Mass</hi> out of my House, <hi>which was not true; but indeed, the Day before my removing from</hi> Woodham-water, <hi>(my whole Houshold in effect being gone to</hi> Newhall) <hi>he said Mass there by mine Appointment.

Moreover, my Chaplain, Dr.</hi> Mallet, <hi>besides mine own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was not ignorant of the Promise made to the Emperor, which did put him out of fear.

                  <p>Much care was taken, and many endeavors used, by the King and Council, to bring her to a good conceit of the Reformation. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this could be effected. As much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable pains was taken by the Emperor's Agent, in laboring to procure for her the free Exercise of her own Religion. Whereupon, She being weary of the Court, retired to <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hereford:</hi> where
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56964:82"/>
                     <hi>Ridley,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> had recourse unto her, and at first was kindly entertained. But having staid Dinner, at her request, he made an offer of his Service to preach before her, on the Sunday following: To which she answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Doors of the Parish-Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, should be open for him, that he might Preach there, if he pleased; but that neither She, nor any of her Servants, would be there to hear him. Madam, (said he) I hope you will not refuse to hear God's Word: To which she answered, That she could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> tell what they called God's Word; it not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been accounted such in the days of her Father. After which, falling into many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent expressions, against the Religion then Established; She dismissed him thus: <hi>My Lord</hi> (said she) <hi>For your Kindness to visit me, I thank you: But for your offer to Preach before me, I thank you not.</hi> Which said, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Sir <hi>Thomas Wharton,</hi> to the place where they dined; by whom he was presented with a Cup of Wine: which having drank, and looking very sadly on it; <q>Surely, (said he) I have done amiss, in drinking in that place, where God's Word offered, was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Whereas, if I had done my duty, I ought to have departed immediately, and to have shaken the dust from off my feet, in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against this House, in which the Word of God could not find admittance.</q> Which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56964:83"/>
words he spake with such a vehemency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as made the hair of some of those who were present, to stand an end, as themselves afterwards confessed.</p>
                  <p>Of this behaviour of the Princess, the Bishop much complained, in a Sermon preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, <hi>July</hi> 16. <hi>Anno</hi> 1553. in which he was appointed by the Lords of the Council, to set forth the Title of Queen <hi>Jane:</hi> to whom the Succession of the Crown had been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by King <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of whose Death the Princess being secretly advertised, dispatched Letters to the Lords of the Council, requiring them, not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Her Just Title to the Crown, but likewise to cause Proclamation to be made in the usual Form: which was accordingly done.</p>

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (the chief Actor against Her) was, soon after this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die. In that short Interval, which past between the Sentence and the Execution, he was frequently visited by Dr. <hi>Heath,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Worcester:</hi> He having made it his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to the Lords, That some Godly, and Learned man, might be licensed by the Queen, to repair to him, for the quiet, and satisfaction of his Conscience.</p>
                  <p>When he was on the Scaffold, turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the People, he made a long Oration to them, touching the quality of his offence, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56964:84"/>
his fore-passed life: and then admonished the Spectators, <hi rend="margQuotes">To stand to the Religion of their Ancestors, rejecting that of later date; which had occasioned all the Misery of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Thirty years: and that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the future, if they desired to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Souls unspotted in the sight of God, and were truly affected to their Country, they should expel those Trumpets of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Preachers of the Reformed Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. That for himself (whatever had been otherwise pretended) he professed no other Religion than that of his Fathers: for testimony whereof he appealed to his good Friend, and Ghostly Father, the Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester:</hi> and finally, that being blinded with Ambition, he had been contented to make rack of his Conscience, by temporizing: For which he professed himself sincerely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and so acknowledged the justice of his Death.</hi>

               <p>Here follows another Relation of this Duke's Death. <hi>By</hi> Howes <hi>upon</hi> Stow, <hi>pag.</hi> 614.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>WHen he came upon the Scaffold, he said to the People, <q>Though my death be terrible to Nature, yet, I pray you judge the best in God's works; for he doth all for the best. And, as for me, I am a wretched
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56964:84"/>
sinner, and have deserved to die. I forgive all Men, and I pray God to forgive them. And if I have offended any of you here, I pray you, and the World, to forgive me. And most chiefly, I desire Forgiveness of the Queens Highness, whom I have most heinously Offended. And I pray you all to bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that I depart in perfect Love, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with all the World; and I beg, that you will assist me with your Prayers, at the hour of my Death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when he had made a Confession of his</hi> Belief, <hi>he added these words:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And here I do protest to you, unfeignedly, even from the bottom of my Heart, that this, which I have spoken, is of my self, and not moved thereto by any Man; nor for any flattery, or hope of Life: And of this I take to witness my Lord of <hi>Worcester,</hi> my old Friend, and Ghostly Father, that he found me in this mind, and opinion, when he came to me. Wherefore be assured, that I have declared this, only upon my own mind, and affection, and for the Zeal and Love that I bear to my Natural Country. I could rehearse much more, even by experience, that I have of this Evil, that hath happened to this Nation by these occasions. But you know, I have another thing to do, whereunto I must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me, for that time draws near.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56964:85"/>
After he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, saying to them that were about him, <hi>I beseech you all, to bear me witness, that I die in the true Catholick Faith.</hi> And then said the Psalms of <hi>Miserere,</hi> and <hi>De Profundis,</hi> his <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and six of the first Verses of the Psalm <hi>In Te, Domine, Speravi,</hi> ending with this Verse, <hi>Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my Spirit:</hi> and when he had thus ended his Prayers, the Executioner asked him forgiveness; to whom he said, <hi>I forgive thee with all my Heart; and do thy part without fear.</hi> And bowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Block, he said, <hi>I have deserved a thousand Deaths:</hi> and then laid his Head upon the Block; and so was Beheaded: whose Body, with the Head, was buried in the Tower, by the Body of <hi>Edward,</hi> late Duke of <hi>Sommerset.</hi> So that there lies before the High Altar in St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Church, <hi>Two Dukes</hi> between <hi>Two Queens:</hi> to wit, the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> between Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and Queen <hi>Catherine:</hi> All Four beheaded.</p>
                  <p>At the same time, and place also, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise beheaded, Sir <hi>John Gates,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John Gates</hi> being upon the Scaffold, spake these, or the like Words: <hi>My coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this day is to die; whereof I assure you all, I am well worthy, for I have lived as viciously, and wickedly, as any Man hath done in the World. I was the greatest</hi> reader <hi>of Scripture</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56964:85"/>
                     <hi>that might be of a Man of my degree, and a worse</hi> follower <hi>thereof there was not living: For I did not read to be edified thereby, nor to seek the Glory of God; but contrariwise, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly to be Seditious, and dispute thereof, and privately to interpret it after mine own brain and affection: Wherefore I exhort you all, to beware, how, and after what sort you come to read God's Holy Word. For it it is not a trifle, or playing-game, to deal with God's Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. Stand not too much in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. For, like as the Bee, of</hi> one Flower <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Hony; and the Spider Poyson of</hi> the same; <hi>Even so you, unless you humbly submit your selves to God, and Charitably read the same, to the intent to be edified thereby, it is to you as Poyson, and worse; and it were better to let it alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, after he had asked the Queens Highness forgiveness, and all the World, he desired the People, of their Charity, to Pray unto God with him, for remission of his sins; and then refusing the Kerchief, laid down his Head, which was strucken off at Three blows.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> as soon as he came to the Scaffold, took every Man by the Hand, and desired them to Pray for him; and then said these Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not unknown to you, wherefore I come hither: which I have worthily well deserved at God's Hands. For I know it to be his Divine Ordinance, by this means to call me to his mercy,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56964:86"/>
                     <hi>and to teach me to know my self,</hi> what I am, <hi>and</hi> whereunto we are all Subject. <hi>I thank his merciful Goodness: For he hath caused me to learn more, in one little dark corner in yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tower, than ever I learned by any Travel, in so many places as I have been. For there I have seen what God is, and how inscrutable his wondrous Works, and how infinite his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be. I have there</hi> seen my self throughly, <hi>and what I am: Nothing but a lump of sin, earth, dust, and of all vileness the most vile. I have there seen and known what the World is, how vain, deceitful, transitory, and short; how wicked and loathsome the works thereof are in the sight of God's Majesty; how he neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the menac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s of the proud and mighty, nor dispises the humbleness of the poor and lowly. Finally, I have there seen what Death is, how near hanging over every Mans head, and yet how uncertain the time is, and how little it is to be feared. And should I fear Death? or be sad therefore? Have I not seen two die before mine Eyes? yea, and within the hearing of my Ears? No; neither the sprinkling of the Blood, nor the shedding thereof, nor the Blood it self, shall make me afraid. And now taking my leave to the same, I pray you all to Pray for me. Come on, Good-fellow; Are you he that must do the deed? I forgive you with all my Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then kneeling down, and laying his Head upon the Block, he said, <hi>I will see how</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:56964:86"/>
                     <hi>fit the Block is for my Neck. I pray strike not yet: for I have a few Prayers to say; and that done, strike on God's Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Prayer ended; and again desiring all to Pray for him, he laid down his Head; which the Executioner took off at one stroke. </p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56964:89"/>
fit, to remove one Difficulty; which was most likely to hinder the progress of this Design.</p>
                  <p>The Difficulty was this.</p>
                  <p>There was a general fear, That if the <hi>Popes</hi> were restored to their former Power, the Church might challenge Restitution of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Possessions. Now to secure them against this Fear, they had not only the Promise of the King and Queen, but some Assurance under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand from the Cardinal Legat; who knew right well, that the Church Lands had been so chopped and changed by the Two last Kings, as not to be restored without the manifest ruine of many of the Nobility, and most of the Gentry; who were invested in the same.</p>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Thus Dr.</hi> Heylyn, <hi>concerning this Obstacle.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </q>
               <p>Which being removed, the work goes on: The Relation whereof is thus delivered by Sir <hi>Rich. Baker,</hi> Page 461.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> being sent for by the King and Queen, came over into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> as Legat <hi>à Latere.</hi> Whereupon a Parliament being called, and the King and Queen sitting there under a Cloth of State, with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal on their right hand; All the Lords, Knights, and Burgesses being present, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> Lord Chancellor, made a short Speech, signifying the Presence of the Lord Cardinal, and that he was sent from the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56964:89"/>
as his Legat <hi>à Latere,</hi> to do a work, tending to the Glory of God, and the Benefit of them all: which (says he) you may better hear from his own Mouth, </p>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Thus Sir</hi> Rich. Baker.</bibl>

                  <bibl>Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> pag. 41.</bibl>
                  <p>Then the Cardinal rose up, and made a very grave and eloquent Speech; First giving them Thanks, for being restored unto his Country: In recompence whereof he told them, That he was come to restore them to the Country, and Court of Heaven; from which, by their departure from the Church, they had been estranged. He therefore earnestly exhorts them, to acknowledge their Errors, and chearfully to receive the benefit, which Christ was ready, by his Vicar, to extend unto them.</p>
                  <p>His Speech was said to have been long, and Artificial; but it concluded to this purpose, That he had the Keys, to open them away into the Church; which they had shut against themselves, by making so many Laws, to the dishonor and reproach of the See Apostolick: On the revoking of which Laws, they should find him ready to make use of the Keys, in opening of the door of the Church unto them. <hi>It was concluded hereupon by both Houses of Parliament, That a Petition should be made, in the Name of the Kingdom;</hi> wherein should be declared, how sorry they were, That they had withdrawn their Obedience from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56964:90"/>
See, and consented to the Statutes made against it: promising to do their best endeavor hereafter, That the said Laws and Statutes should be Repealed; beseeching the King and Queen to intercede for them with his Holiness, that they might be Absolved from their Crimes and Censures which they had incurred and be received as Penitent Children into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These things being thus resolved upon, both Houses are called again to the Court, on Sr.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews-<hi>day:</hi> Where being Assembled in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King and Queen, they were ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Whether they were pleased, that Pardon should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Legat; and whether they would return to the Unity, of the Church, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Pope, Supreme Head thereof? To which they assenting, the Petition was presented to their Majesties in the Name of the Parliament: Which being publickly read, they arose with a purpose to have moved the Cardinal in it: who meeting their desires, declared his readiness in giving them that Satisfaction, which they would have cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>And having caused the Authority given him by the Pope, to be publickly read; he shewed, how acceptable the repentance of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was in the sight of God; and that the very Angels in Heaven rejoyced at the Conversion of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56964:90"/>
this Kingdom. Which said, they all kneeled upon their Knees, and imploring the Mercy of God, received Absolution for themselves, and the rest of the Kingdom: <hi>Which Absolution was pronounced in these following words,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who with his most precious Blood, hath redeemed and washed us from all our sins and iniquities, that he might purchase to himself a glorious Spouse, without spot or wrinkle, and whom the Father hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Head over all his Church, He by his Mercy Absolve you: And we by Apostolical Authority given unto us, by his Holiness Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the 3d. his Vice-gerent here on Earth, do Absolve and Free you, and every one of you, with the whole Realm, and the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, from all Heresie and Schism, and from all and every Judgment, Censures, and Pains for that cause incurred: and also we do restore you again to the Unity of our Mother the Holy Church, as in our Letters more plainly it shall appear: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which words of his being seconded by a loud</hi> Amen <hi>by such as were present,</hi> he concluded that days work with a solemn Procession to the Chappel, for rendring Prayers and Thanks to Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And because this great work was wrought on St.</hi> Andrews-<hi>day,</hi> the Cardinal procured a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56964:91"/>
Decree, or Canon, to be made in the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Bishops and Clergy, That from thenceforth the Feast of St. <hi>Andrews-</hi>day should be kept in the Church of <hi>England</hi> for a <hi>Majus Duplex</hi> (as the Rituals call it) and Celebrated with as much Solemnity as any other in the year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was thought fit also, That the Actions of that Day should be communicated, on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, at St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Cross, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and the rest of the City:</hi> According to which appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Cardinal went from <hi>Lambeth</hi> by Water, and landing at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s-wharf, from thence proceeded to the Church, with a Cross, two Pillars, and two Pole-axes of Silver, born before him: Received by the Lord Chancellor with a Solemn Procession. They tarried till the King came from <hi>Westminster.</hi> Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon whose coming, the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor went into the Pulpit, and Preached upon those words of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Brethren, ye are to know, That it is now time to rise from sleep, &amp;c.</hi> In which Sermon he declared, what had been done on the <hi>Friday</hi> before, in the Submission which was made to the Pope, by the Lords and Commons, in the Name of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the whole Kingdom; and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution granted to them by the Cardinal in the Name of the Pope. <hi>Which done, and Prayers being made for the whole Estate of the Catholick</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:56964:91"/>
                     <hi>Church; the Company was for that time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed. And on the</hi> Thursday <hi>after, the Bishops and Clergy then Assembled in their Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, presented themselves before the Cardinal at</hi> Lambeth, <hi>and kneeling reverently on their Knees, they obtained Pardon for all their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, Schisms and Heresies. Upon which a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Absolution was pronounced, That so all sorts of People might partake of the</hi> Popes Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>and thereby testifie their Obedience, and Submission to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The news whereof coming to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he caused not only many Solemn Processions to be made in <hi>Rome,</hi> and most part of <hi>Italy;</hi> but proclaimed a Jubilee to be held on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> then next coming. For the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating of which Solemnity he alledged this reason, That it became him to imitate the Father of the Prodigal Child; and having received his lost Son, not only to express a Domestical Joy, but likewise to invite all others to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>During this Parliament was held a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation also (as before was intimated;)</hi> By whom a Petition was prepared, to be presented in the Name of the Convocation, to both their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, humbly beseeching them, That they would be pleased to interceed with the Cardinal, not to insist on the restoring of Church-Lands.</p>

                  <p>MAny <hi>English Protestants</hi> forsook the Kingdom, to the number of Eight Hundred: who having put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into several Cities, partly in <hi>Germany,</hi> and partly amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and their Confederates, kept up the Face and Form of an <hi>English Church,</hi> in each of their several Congregations. Their principal retiring places amongst the last were <hi>Arow, Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va:</hi> And in the first, the Cities of <hi>Emden, Strasburgh,</hi> and <hi>Frankfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Frankfort</hi> they enjoyed the greatest privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and therefore resorted thither in greatest numbers: which made them the more apt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Schisms and Factions. At their first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place, they were permitted to have
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56964:97"/>
the use of one of their Churches; which had before been granted to such <hi>French</hi> exiles as had repaired thither on the like occasion: yet so, that the <hi>French</hi> were still to hold their Right; the <hi>English</hi> to have the use of it one day, and the <hi>French</hi> another; and on the Lord's Day, so to divide the hours between them, that the one might be no hindrance unto the other.</p>
                  <p>It hath been also said, That there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other condition imposed upon them, of being conform to the <hi>French</hi> in Doctrine and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: Which condition, if it were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and not sought by themselves, must needs be very agreeable to the temper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of their principal Leaders; who being, for the most part, of the <hi>Zuinglian Gospellers,</hi> at their going hence, became the great promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Puritan Faction</hi> at their coming home. The Names of <hi>Whittingham, Williams, Goodman, Wood,</hi> and <hi>Sutton,</hi> who appeared in the head of this Congregation, declare suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of what Principles they were, and how willing they would be to lay aside the face of an English Church, and frame themselves to any Liturgy but their own.</p>
                  <p>The noise of this new Church at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> occasioned <hi>Knox</hi> (who after proved the great Incendiary of the Realm and Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> to leave his Sanctuary in <hi>Geneva,</hi> in hope to make a better market for himself in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:56964:97"/>
These <hi>Frankfort-</hi>Schismaticks desire, That all Divine Offices might be executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of the Church of <hi>Geneva;</hi> which <hi>Knox</hi> would by no means yield to, thinking himself as able to make a <hi>Rule</hi> for his own Congregation, as any <hi>Calvin</hi> of them all.</p>
                  <p>Infinite were the Confusions which they had amongst themselves, and from hence was the beginning of the <hi>Puritan Faction,</hi> against the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church; that of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Episcopal Government;</hi> and finally, that also of the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> against the <hi>Super-intendency</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sorrow seldom goes alone; for their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the Government, Form, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> drew on an Alteration also in point of Doctrine. Such of the <hi>English</hi> as had retired to <hi>Geneva,</hi> employed themselves in setting out a New Translation of the Bible in the English-Tongue; which afterwards they published with certain Marginal Notes upon it, very He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox in point of Doctrine; some dangerous and seditious, in reference to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and some as scandalous, in respect of Episcopal Government.</p>
                  <p>From this time the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination</hi> began to be dispersed in <hi>English Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,</hi> as the only necessary, Orthodox, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truth.</p>

                  <p>BEfore She undertook this Work, She thought it necessary to Communicate her purpose unto some of the Council: and therefore calling them to Her, She is said to have spoken to them in these following words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We have willed you to be called to Us, to the intent you might hear of Me, my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the Resolution of my Mind, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lands and Possessions, as well of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, as of other Churches whatsoever, being now in my Possession.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>First, I do consider, that the said Lands were taken away from the Churches aforesaid in time of Schism; and that by unlawful means, such as are contrary both to the Law of God, and of the Church: For which cause my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth not suffer me to detain them. And therefore I here expresly refuse, either to claim, or retain those Lands for Mine: But with all my heart, freely and willingly, without all Paction, or Condition, here and before God, I do Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Relinquish the said Lands and Possessions, or Inheritances whatsoever; and renounce the same with this mind and purpose, that order and disposition thereof may be taken, as shall seem best liking to the Pope, or his Legat, to the Honor of God, and Wealth of this our Realm. And albeit you may object to Me again, That the State of my Kingdom, the Dignity thereof, and my Crown Imperial, cannot be Honorably Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and Furnished without the Possessions aforesaid: Yet notwithstanding</hi> (and so She had affirmed before, when She was bent upon the Restitution of the Tenths and First Fruits) <hi>I set more by the Salvation of my Soul, than by Ten such Kingdoms: And therefore the said Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions I utterly refuse here to hold, after that sort and Title: And give most hearty Thanks to God, who hath given me a Husband of the same mind; who hath no less good Affection in this behalf, than I my self. Wherefore I Charge and Command, That my Chancellor (with whom I have confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:56964:99"/>

And give your Attendance upon me, for the more full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the State of my Kingdom, and of the aforesaid Possessions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according as you your selves do understand the matter, and can inform him in the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this opening of Her Mind, the Lords thought it req<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>isite to direct some course, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in She might satisfie Her desires, to Her own great Honor, and yet not Alienate too much at once of the publick Patrimony.</p>
                  <p>The Abbey of <hi>Westminster</hi> had been Founded for a <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Benedictin</hi> Monks by King <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> valued at the Suppression by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, at the yearly Sum of Three thousand, Nine hundred, Seventy seven pounds in good old Rents, <hi>Anno</hi> 1539. At which time, having taken to himself the best and greatest part of the Lands thereof; he Founded with the rest a Collegiate Church, consisting of a Dean, and Secular Canons. But now the Queen put into it a Convent of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins,</hi> consisting of an Abbot, and Fourteen Monks: which with their Officers, were as many as the Lands then left upon it, would well maintain.</p>
                  <p>A Convent of <hi>Observants</hi> (being a reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Order of <hi>Franciscan Friers)</hi> had been Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh near the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56964:99"/>
of <hi>Greenwich;</hi> and was the first which felt the fury of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some open opposition made, by some of the Friars, in favour of Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> the Mother of the Queen now Reigning: Which moved Her, in a pious gratitude, to re-edifie that ruined House, and to restore as many as could be found of that Order, to their old Habitations; making up their Corporation with some new <hi>Observants</hi> to a competent number.</p>
                  <p>She gathered together also a New Convent of <hi>Dominican,</hi> or <hi>Black-Friars;</hi> for whom She provided a House in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> in the City of <hi>London;</hi> fitting the same with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, both for the Divine Office, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for other necessary Uses.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Syon,</hi> near <hi>Brentford,</hi> there had been anciently a House of Religious Women, <hi>Nunns</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> dissolved, as were all the rest, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. Such of these as remained alive, with the addition of some others, who were willing to embrace that course of Life, made up a competent number for a New Plantation: These She restored likewise to their old Habitation, repairing their House, and laying to it a sufficient Estate in Lands, for their future maintenance.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Sheen,</hi> on the other-side of the Water, there had been Anciently another Religious House not far from a Mansion of the Kings; to which they much resorted, till the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56964:100"/>
of <hi>Richmond.</hi> This House She stocked with a New Convent of <hi>Charthusians,</hi> and endowed it with a Revenue great enough to maintain that Order.</p>
                  <p>And the next year, having Closed up the West-end of the Quire, or Chancel, of the Church of St. <hi>John</hi>'s near <hi>Smithfield,</hi> (which was all the Protector <hi>Sommerset</hi> had left standing of it) She restored the same to the Hospitality of the Knights of St. <hi>John,</hi> to whom it formerly belonged, assigning a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Endowment to it for their more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Subsistance.</p>
                  <p>An Hospital had been formerly Founded in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> by her Grand-father King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> relief of such Pilgrims, as either went on their Devotions to the Shrine of St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> or any other eminent Shrine, or Saint, in these parts of the Kingdom. Now this Hospital being destroyed by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and the Means disposed of, it could no: be restored to its first condition, but by a new endowment from such other Lands belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religious Houses, which were remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Crown.</p>
                  <p>But the Queen was so resolved upon it, and withal so desirous to add some Works of <hi>Charity</hi> unto those of Piety; or else in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Her Grand-father, (whose Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on She restored at <hi>Greenwich</hi> also) the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56964:100"/>
was again Re-founded, and a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent yearly Rent allotted to the Master, and Brethren, for the Entertainment of the poor, according to the tenor and effect of the first Institution. Which Prince-like Act, so wrought upon the Maids of Honor, and other Ladies of the Court, that for the better attaining of the Queens good Grace, they furnished the same at their own costs, with new Beds, Bedding, and other necessary Furniture, in a very ample manner. In which condition it continues to this very day; the Mastership of the Hospital being looked on as a good preferment for any well deserving Man about the Court.</p>
                  <p>How far the Queens Example, Seconded by the Ladies about the Court, countenanced by the King, and earnestly insisted on by the <hi>Pope,</hi> might have prevailed on the Nobility and Gentry, for doing the like, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing their Church-Lands, or assigning some part of them to the like Foundations, it is hard to say: most probable it is, that if the Queen had lived some few years longer, either for Love to Her, or for fear of gaining the King's Displeasure, or otherwise out of an unwillingness to incur the <hi>Popes</hi> Curse, and the Churches Censures, there might have been very much done that way, though not all at once.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:56964:101"/>
That which might have much furthered this business, was the Greatness to which <hi>Philip</hi> had attained at this present time, when the Queen was most intent on these new Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. For having passed over to <hi>Calais</hi> in the Month of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1555. And the next day going to the Emperor's Court, which was then at <hi>Brussels,</hi> he found his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Resolution of Resigning to him all his Dominions and Estates, except the Empire (or the bare Title rather of it) which was to be Surrendred to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> not that he had not a Design to settle the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Dignity on his Successor in the Realm of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the better attaining of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Monarchy, which he was said to have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to, over all the West: But that he had been crossed in it by <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the Eldest Son of his Brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who Succeeded to his Father in it, and left the same Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, in a manner, to the Princes of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> of the <hi>German</hi> race.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Charles,</hi> grown weary of the World, broken with Wars, and desirous to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Divine Meditation, resolved to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himself of all Civil Employments, and spend the remainder of his life in the Monastery of St. <hi>Justus,</hi> situated amongst the Mountains of <hi>Estremadura,</hi> a Province in the Realm of <hi>Castile.</hi>

In pursuance whereof; having called before him the Principal of the Nobility, and Great Men of His several Kingdoms and Estates, He made a Resignation of All his Hereditary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions to King <hi>Philip,</hi> his Son; having then scarce attained to the Fifty fifth year of his Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

agree in a general malice against Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet they strangely disagree amongst themselves, by furious Animosities, and hatred one against another. One Example whereof is here related by Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> pag. 80. in this following short Note concerning the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> abominated nothing more than an <hi>English Protestant,</hi> because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred not with them in their Doctrine of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> tells us of a Friend of his in the Dukedom of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> that was generally hated by the rest of his Country-men, for being hospitable to some few of the <hi>English Nation.</hi> And it is further signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> in an Epistle of this year, That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> could find no other Names (but the <hi>Devils-Martyrs)</hi> for such as suffered Death in <hi>England,</hi> in defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now one ground of this their hatred was,</hi> That <hi>John à Lasco,</hi> and his Company, had been lately there, where thy spoke so reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession, and the Rites and Ceremonies of their Churches, as rendred them uncapable of any better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment than they found amongst them. And by the behaviour of these men, coming then from <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> past their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Church it self; and consequently on all those who suffered in defence thereof. Some of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had given out, on the

former ground, That the <hi>English</hi> had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly suffered the greatest Hardships, both at home, and abroad, because they Writ, and Spake, so irreverently of the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>IN the First year of this Queens Reign, All Bishops, that had been deprived in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, were restored to their Bishopricks, and the new removed.</p>
               <p>Also this year, on the Twenty seventh of <hi>August,</hi> the Service was sung in Latin in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church.

               <p>In her Third year, Eight hundred <hi>English Protestants</hi> sorsook the Kingdom; who fell into great Confusions amongst themselves, being in other Countries.</p>

In her Fourth year, Monasteries were be gun to be re-edified.</p>
               <p>In her Fifth year, great endeavors were used by Sectaries, to raise Sedition, by Seditious Books, and unlawful Meetings, or Conventicles.</p>
               <p>In her Sixth year, She built Publick Schools in the University of <hi>Oxford:</hi> Which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in tract of time, and of no beautiful Structure, when they were at the best, were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down: In place whereof (but upon a larger extent of Ground) was raised that Goodly and Magnificent Fabrick, which we now behold.</p>

               <p>BEfore we begin this Queens Reign, we will (following Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s order) first make a Relation out of him of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fortunes of her Mother, <hi>Anne Boleign;</hi> of whom thus he writes in his History of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> pag. 86.</p>

                     <hi>Anne Boleign,</hi> from her tender years, was brought up in the Court of <hi>France:</hi> Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>England,</hi> was preferred to be Maid of Honor to Queen <hi>Catherine:</hi> In whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the King falls in Love with her. But so long concealed his Affections, that there was a great League contracted betwixt her, and the young Lord <hi>Peircy,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi> But that being broken off, by the endeavors of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey;</hi> and the King laboring for a Divorce, from Queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> that he might Marry her; that also was sought to be obstructed by the Cardinal: Which being understood by Mrs. <hi>Anne Boleign</hi> she seeks all ways for his destruction; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far with the King, that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Indicted, and Attainted of a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> and not long after, by the Counsel of <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> (who had sormerly been the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Solicitor in his Legatine Court) envolves the whole Clergy in the same Crime with him. And by perswasion of this man, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the said Clergy, to acknowledge him for <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> on Earth, of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and to make no new <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> not to Execute any such, when made, by his consent. And having thus brought his own Clergy under his Command, he was the less solicitous how his matters went in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning his <hi>Divorce.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he privately Marries Mistris <hi>Anne Boleign:</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:56964:105"/>
And a long time after, to wit, Three or Four Months after the Birth of the Princess <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> began a Parliament; in which the Kings first Marriage was declared <hi>Unlawful;</hi> and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the <hi>Crown</hi> settled upon His Issue by this Second Marriage: An Oath being devised in maintenance of the said Succession; and not long after, <hi>Moor</hi> and <hi>Fisher</hi> were Executed for refusing to take that Oath.</p>
                  <p>The New Queen being thus settled; and considering, that the Pope and She had such different Interests, that they could not subsist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, She resolved to suppress his Power what she could. But finding, that the Pope was too well entrenched, to be dislodged upon a sudden, it was advised by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to begin with taking in <hi>the Outworks</hi> first; which being gained, it would be no hard matter to beat him out of his Trenches.</p>
                  <p>In order whereunto a Visitation is begun, in which a diligent Enquiry was to be made into all <hi>Abbey</hi>'s, <hi>Priories,</hi> and <hi>Nunneries</hi> within the Kingdom: (an Account of which <hi>Visitation,</hi> and the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ssolution of <hi>Abbeys,</hi> hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.)</p>
                  <p>But the New Queen (for whose sake <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> had contrived that Plot) did not live to see this Dissolution.</p>
                  <p>For such is the uncertainty of Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that when she thought her Self most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56964:106"/>
and free from Danger, She became most obnoxious to the ruine prepared for Her. It had pleased God, upon the Eighth of <hi>January,</hi> to put an end unto the Calamities of the Virtuous, but unfortunate Queen, unto whose Bed she had succeeded: The News whereof she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with such contentment, that she caused her self to be apparelled in lighter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, than was agreeable to the season, or the sad occasion. Whereas, if she had rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood her own Condition, She could not but have known, that the long Life of Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> was to be her best preservation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all changes, which the King's loose Affections, or any other Alteration in the Affairs of State, were otherwise like to draw upon her.</p>
                  <p>But this Contentment held not long. For within Three Weeks after, She fell in Travail; in which she miscarried of a Son, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme discontent of the Father: Who looked upon it, as an Argument of God's displeasure, as being much offended at this Second Marriage. He then began to think of His ill Fortune, with both His Wives; both Marriages subject to cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and the Legitimation of both His Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, likely to be called in question, in the time succeeding. He must therefore cast about for another Wife; of whose Marriage, and his Issue by Her, there could rise no controversie. His eye had carried him to a Gentlewoman in the Queens Attendance; on the enjoying of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56964:106"/>
whom he so fixed his Thoughts, that he had quite obliterated all remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Loves.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon He began to be as weary of Queen <hi>Annes</hi> Gayeties, and Secular humor, as formerly, of the Gravity, and Reservedness of Queen <hi>Katharine.</hi> And causing many eyes to observe her Actions, they brought him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of some particulars; which he conceived, might give him a sufficient ground to proceed upon.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Rochfort</hi> (her own Brother) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some Suit to obtain (by her means) of the King, was found whispering to her on her Bed, when she was in it; which was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an act of some dishonor done, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be done to the King: in the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating whereof, with all odious circumstances, none was more forward, than the Lady <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> her self.</p>
                  <p>It was observed also, That Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> Groom of the Stool to the King, had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very dear affection for her; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving himself hopes of succeeding in the King's Bed, if she chanced to survive Him: And it appeared, that she had given him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to make his Affection known, and to acquaint her with his hopes; which she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, by twitting him, in a frolick humor, with <hi>looking after dead mens shoes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56964:107"/>
                     <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Breerton,</hi> both Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, were observed also to be very diligent in their Services and Addresses to her; which were construed more to proceed from Love, than Duty.</p>
                  <p>Out of all these Premises, the King resolved to come to a conclusion of His aims and wishes.</p>
                  <p>A Solemn Tilting was maintained at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich;</hi> at which both the King and Queen were present; the Lord <hi>Rochfort,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> being principal Challengers.</p>
                  <p>Here the Queen (by chance) let fall her Handkerchief; which was taken up by one of her supposed Favourites, who stood under the Window; whom the King perceived to wipe his face with it. This taken by the King to have been done of purpose, he thereupon leaves the Queen, and all the rest, and goes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to <hi>Westminster: Rochfort</hi> and <hi>Norris,</hi> are the next day committed to the Tower; and the Queen likewise. After which <hi>Breerton</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> with <hi>Mark Smeton,</hi> one of the King's Musicians, were commited on the same occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. These persons being thus committed, and the cause made known, the next care was to find sufficient evidence for their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was objected, That the <hi>Queen,</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of hope of having any issue Male by the King, had used the company of the Lord <hi>Rochfort, Norris, Breerton, Weston,</hi> and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56964:107"/>
                     <hi>Smeton;</hi> involving her at once in no smaller crimes, than Adultery and Incest.</p>
                  <p>It appears by a Letter of Sir <hi>William King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, that he had much communication with her, when she was his Prisoner; in which her language seemed to be broken, and distressed, betwixt tears and laughter. She exclaimed against <hi>Norris,</hi> as if he had accused her. It was further signified in that Letter, that she named some others, who had obsequiously applyed themselves to her Love and Service, acknowledging such passages, as shewed, she had made use of very great liberties. The conclusion of this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was, That both the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the rest of the Prisoners were all put to death.</p>
                  <p>So died this great Lady; one of the most remarkable Mockeries and Disports of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which these last ages have produced; raised from the quality of a private Lady, to the Bed of a King; Crowned on the Throne, and Executed on the Scaffold; the Fabrick of her Power and Glory being Six years in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but cast down in an instant: The splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and magnificence of her Coronation, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have no other end, but to make her the more glorious Sacrifice, at the next Alteration.</p>
                  <p>But her death was not the chief mark the King aim'd at. If she had only lost her Head, though with the loss of her Honor, it would have been no Bar to her Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:56964:108"/>
from Succeeding her Father in the Throne. Now he must have his Bed free from all such pretensions, the better to draw on the following Marriage.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore thought necessary, that she should be separated from his Bed, by some other means than the Ax or Sword; and that He should be legally separated from her in a Court of Judicature; when the Sentence of Death had deprived Her of all means, as well as of all manner of desire to dispute the point.</p>
                  <p>It doth not appear in Record, upon what ground this Marriage was dissolved. All which occurs, in reference to it, is a Solemn Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under the Seal of the Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> by which that Marriage is declared (on good and valid Reasons) to be <hi>null,</hi> and void.</p>
                  <p>Which Sentence was pronounced at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> in the Presence of most of the great Men of that time, and approved by the Prelates and Clergy assembled in their Convocation; and lastly, confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In which Act, there also passed a Clause, which declared the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate.</hi>

                           <p>THis is the place where your glorious and noble Progenitors have paternized the Kingdom from oppression. Here is the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary where, in all Ages but this of ours, our Mother Church found still a sound Protection. I should be infinitely sorrowful, that from you, that are so lovely Branches of antiquity, and Catholick Honor, the Catholick Faith should be so deeply wounded. For God's, and your own Goodness sake, leave not to Posterity, so great a blemish, that you were the First, and only those, that give it up to ruine. Where there is Cause you nobly punish, and with Justice; but beware of infringing so long continued Priviledges, or denying the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, the parts of their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that is enjoyed by every private Subject. The <hi>Commons</hi> shoot their Arrows at our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, which are the Motives that conceit us, (or make us to be conceived) guilty. Is all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56964:109"/>
the Kingdom innocent, and we only faulty, that there is no room left for other Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions far more weighty? The Diligence, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and Liberality of your Great Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers endowed their Mother Church with fair and large Revenues, making it still their greatest care to keep her upright, able, still in freedom: And will you give consent, that like a servile Bondmaid, she now sinks lower to a naked thraldom, and, by degrees, be forced from her Mansion? If not, to what end serves the flux of these Petitions, that taint your Ears with Language far unfit the Ears of Christian Princes. These strike not at the withered Branches, but, at the Tree, on which Religion groweth. Certainly, All are not guilty. Admit that some, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force (or urge) be vicious, must it conclude, there is none good amongst us, or able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their proper vices? Will you assume a Power, till now unheard of, to give away their Rites, by new made Statutes? If you will seek and sist our Constitutions, you shall there find as strict Injunctions, as you can make, for Reformation. But, I suppose, it is not that is aimed at; pretence of Restauration, (or Reformation) tends to ruine, else such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings could not find such Favor. My Lords, consider well your actions; be advised. This Cause seems only Ours, it will be Yours, if that the Mother Church do feel Injustice
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56964:109"/>
Your turns are next to feel the like Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. When Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> begins to fail, then all must perish. Heretick, (or Heretical) Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies taint the common People, whom Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties betray, even to Perdition. Let Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations tell you your own story. <hi>Husse, Luther,</hi> and such frantick Teachers, cry out against the Church in all their Sermons, they do pretend nothing else but Reformation, when they themselves are deepest dyed in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. What follows them, (to wit, Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) we may expect in Justice. The Churches Wealth, occasioned this first moving. If that were poor, our Vices would be Vertues, and none would be so forward to Accuse us. What can we look for then but Desolation, where private ends are made a publick grievance? Our Lesser Houses are desired from us; not that their value doth deserve the Motion; but, that the Greater may succeed their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; which soon will follow, if the gap be opened. The King himself, I hope, is too too gracious, to set abroach an Action so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered: Nor, can I think, the Lower House of Commons will be so blind, to Second this loose Motion. Some giddy-brain, whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Fortunes lead him to hope to raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of our Ruins, betrays their Judgments with a shew of Justice; which seeks in truth but meerly Innovation, which must succeed, unless you do oppose it. Wherefore, My
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56964:110"/>
Lords, call back that Ancient Vertue, that so long time hath sat in these your places. Now is the time to shew your worth; the Church Implores it, the Church which you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for your Mother. If Liberty take place of Faith, farewel Religion. The <hi>Turk</hi> may then direct us how to guid in Rapine, Blood, and Murder. Foul Dissention proceeds from want of good Devotion. The lack of Faith, begets these strange Conceptions, which time will make stark dead, if we continue.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>She was Crowned according to the Order of the <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Owen Oglethorpe,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlisle;</hi> the only Man, amongst all the Bishops, who could be wrought on by her, to perform that Office: Whether it were that they saw some Alteration coming, to which they were resolved not to yield conformity, or for some other reasons, is not certainly known.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> had a particular reason for his refusing this; because he had been one of those, that were sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to render the Submission of the Kingdom, to the Pope still Living; and therefore could not now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with Honor, in any such Action, as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry with it a Repugnancy, (if not a manifest Inconsistency) with the same Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It cannot be denyed but that there were Three Bishops yet alive of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s making, all of them Zealously affected to the Reformation. And possibly it may seem stange, that the <hi>Queen</hi> received not the Crown rather
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56964:111"/>
from one of their hands, than to put her self to the hazard of so many denials, as had been given Her by the others.</p>
                     <p>But unto this it may be Answered, That the said Bishops, at that time were deprived of their Sees, and therefore not in a capacity to perform that service. Besides, there being at that time, no other Form estalished for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, than that which had much in it of the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> she was not sure, that any of the said Three Bishops would have acted in it, without such Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Omissions, in the whole course of the Order, as might have rendred the action questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable amongst captious Men.</p>
                     <p>And therefore finally she thought it more conducible to her Reputation amongst Foreign Princes, to be Crowned by the hands of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Bishop, (or one, at least, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted such) than if it had been done by any of the other Religion. </p>

                  <p>QUEEN <hi>Elizabeth</hi> knew full well, that Her Legitimation, and the Pope's Supremacy, could not stand together, and that She could not possibly maintain the one, without a discarding of the other. But in this case it concerned her to walk very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and not to unmask her self too much at once, before she had put her self into a posture of Ability to make good her Actions. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding upon a serious debate of all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, she was resolved to proceed to a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as the time should serve.</p>
                  <p>In order whereunto, She Constitutes her Privy Council; which she compounds of such Ingredients, as might neither give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any of those, who wished well to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or alienate their Affections
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56964:112"/>
from Her, whose Hearts were more inclined to the Reformation. Now, as the <hi>Papists,</hi> in the first beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> hoping thereby to obtain her Favor, began to build new Altars, and set up the Mass; So fared it now with the Zealots among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; who measuring the Queens Affections by their own, or else presuming, that their Errors would be taken for an honest Zeal, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themselves as busily in the demolishing of Altars, and defacing of Images, as if they had been Licensed, and commanded to it by some Legal Warrant.</p>
                  <p>It happened also, that some of the Ministers, who remained at home; and others, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, in great numbers, from beyond the Seas, had put themselves into the Pulpits, and bitterly enveighed against the Superstitions, and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> accused the others of Heresies, Schisms, Innovation in the Worship of God. For the Suppressing of which Disorders, the Queen Commanded, there should be no Disputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion; and that no Man, of what Perswasion soever he was, should be suffered to Preach in publick, but only such as should be Licensed. Which Command and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was so strictly observed, that no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was Preached at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, or any Publick place in <hi>London,</hi> till the <hi>Easter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:56964:112"/>
At which time, when the Preacher was to go into the Pulpit, the Door was locked, and the Key thereof not to be found: So that a Smith was sent for to break open the Door; and that being done, the like necessity was found, of cleansing, and making sweet the place; which by a long disuse had contracted so much filth and nastiness, as rendred it unfit for a present Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>By another Proclamation it was enjoyned, That no Man, of what quality or degree soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, should presume to alter any thing in the State of Religion, or innovate, in any of the Rites and Ceremonies thereunto belonging: But that all such Rites and Ceremonies, should be observed in all Parish Churches of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as were then used, and retained in her Majesties Chappel, until some further order should be taken in it. Only it was permitted, That the Litany should be said in the <hi>English Tongue;</hi> as likewise the Epistle, and Gospel, at the time of High Mass; which was accordingly done in all the Churches of <hi>London</hi> on the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after; and by degrees, in all the other Churches of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Further than this, She thought it not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to proceed at the present: Only She Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Priest, or Bishop, (for some say it was the <hi>one,</hi> and some the <hi>other)</hi> who Officiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Altar in the Chappel Royal, not to make any Elevation of the Sacrament, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56964:113"/>
to prevent the Adoration, which was given to it; which she could not suffer to be done in her sight, without a most apparent wrong to her Judgment, and Conscience: Which being made known in other places, and all other Churches being commanded to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Example of her Chappel, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was forborn also in most other places.</p>
                  <p>And though there were no further progress made, towards a Reformation, by any publick Act, or Edict; yet secretly a Reformation in the Form of Worship, and consequently in point of Doctrine, was both intended, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>

                  <p>QUeen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> intending an Alteration of Religion, would not do it all at once, and upon the sudden, but by little and little. As at first she permitted only the Epistles and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of the Day to be read at Mass in <hi>English.</hi> But in all other matters they were to follow the <hi>Roman</hi> Rite and Custom, until order could be taken for Establishing Religion by Authority of Parliament. And a severe Proclamation was set out, prohibiting all Disputations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. By which means She both put the <hi>Protestants</hi> in hope, and put not <hi>Papists</hi> out
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56964:113"/>
of hope. Yet privately, She committed the Correcting of the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> (set forth in the <hi>English Tongue,</hi> under King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth) to the care and diligence of Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>But the matter was carried on so closely, that it was not communicated to any, but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cecil.</hi> Soon after this, the use of the Lord's Supper <hi>in both kinds</hi> was by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament allowed: And (within Two or Three Months) the Sacrifice of the Mass was abolished, and the Liturgy in the <hi>English Tongue</hi> Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though (as some say) but with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Six Voices in the House of Commons.</p>
                  <p>The next Month the Oath of Supremacy was offered to the Catholick Bishops, and others; and the Month following, Images were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the Churches, broken, and burnt. By these degrees Religion in <hi>England</hi> was changed; <hi>The Supremacy confirmed to the Queen;</hi> As many of the Bishops, as refused to take the Oath, were presently deprived of their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and <hi>Protestant</hi> Bishops put in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of them.</p>

                  <p>NOw a Parliament draws on, Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly in reference to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which was therein to be established. The <hi>Queens</hi> design, in order to it could not be so closely carried, but that such Lords and Gentlemen, as had the managing of Elections in their several Counties, retained such Men for Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as they conceived most likely to comply with their intentions for a Reformation: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom, none appeared more active than the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cecil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Parliament there passed an Act, for Restoring to the Crown the <hi>Tenths,</hi> and <hi>First-Fruits.</hi> For the better drawing on of which Concession, it was pretended, that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Crown had been much dilapidated, and that it could not be Supported with such
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56964:115"/>
Honor as it ought to be, if Restitution were not made of such Rents, as were of late dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from it. Upon which ground they also passed an Act for the Dissolution of all such Monasteries, Convents, and Religious Orders, as had been Founded, and Established by the <hi>Queen</hi> deceased.</p>
                  <p>When the Act of Parliament concerning the <hi>Supremacy</hi> came to be Debated, it seemed to be a thing abhorrent, even in Nature and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, that a Woman should be declared <hi>Supream Head on Earth of the Church of England.</hi> But those of the Reformed Party meant nothing else, than to contend about words, so they might gain the Point they aimed at: Which was the stripping of the <hi>Pope</hi> of all Authority within these Dominions; and fixing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Ecclesiastical Power in the Crown Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial: And this they did, not by the Name of <hi>Supreme Head</hi> (which they perceived might be lyable to some just Exceptions) but (which comes all to one) of <hi>Supreme Governess.</hi>

                           <p>WIth all humble Submission of my whole Discourse to your Wisdoms, I purpose to speak to the Body of this <hi>Act,</hi> touching the <hi>Supremacy;</hi> that so, what this Honourable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly is now a doing, concerning the passing of this Act, may thereby be better weighed, and considered by your Wisdoms.</p>
                           <p>First, When by the Virtue of this Act of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56964:116"/>
                              <hi>Supremacy,</hi> we must forsake and fly from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be considered, what matter lieth therein; and what matter of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or inconvenience; or else, whether there be none at all.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, If the intent of this Act be to grant, or settle upon the <hi>Queens</hi> Majesty a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;</hi> it would be considered of your Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, what this <hi>Supremacy</hi> is, and whether it doth consist in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government, or <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If in <hi>Temporal;</hi> what further Authority can this House give Her, more than what She already hath by right of Inheritance? And not by our Gift, but by the Appointment of God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sovereign <hi>Lord</hi> and Lady; our <hi>King,</hi> and Queen; our <hi>Empress</hi> and Emperor: And if, further than this, we acknowledge Her to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> we ough: also to grant, that the Emperor, or any other Prince, being Catholick, and their Subjects Protestants, <hi>are to be Heads of their Church.</hi> Whereby we shall do an Act, as disagreeable to <hi>Protestants,</hi> as this seems to <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If you say, The <hi>Supremacy</hi> consists in <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> concernments.</p>
                           <p>Then, it would be considered, what the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Government</hi> is; and in what points it doth chiefly consist: Which being first agreed upon, it would be further considered of your Wisdoms, whether this House may grant it to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56964:116"/>
her Highness or not? And whether her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be an apt Person to receive the same?</p>
                           <p>So by through Examination of these parts, your Honors shall proceed in this matter ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, upon such sure knowledge, as not to be deceived by ignorance.</p>
                           <p>Now to the First Point, wherein I promised to examine, what matter of weight, danger, or inconvenience might be incurred, by this our forsaking, and flying from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if there were no further matter therein, than the with-drawing our Obedience from the <hi>Popes Person,</hi> (supposing, that he had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a very Austere and Severe Father to us) then the business were not of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; as indeed it is, as will immediately here appear.</p>
                           <p>For, by relinquishing and forsaking the Church, or See of <hi>Rome,</hi> we must forsake and fly from all General Councils.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, From all Canonical and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Laws of the Church of Christ.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, From the Judgment of all other Christian Princes.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, and Lastly, We must forsake and fly from the Holy Unity of Christ's Church; and so by leaping out of <hi>Peter's</hi> Ship, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our selves to be over-whelmed in the waves of Schism, of Sects, and Divisions.</p>
                           <p>First, Touching the General Councils, I shall name unto you these Four: The <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56964:117"/>
the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Council, the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine,</hi> and the <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> All which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all Men.</p>
                           <p>Of these same Councils, Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this wise; <hi>Sicut enim Sancti Evangelii quatuor Libros, sic haec quatuor Concilia,</hi> Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Constantinopolitanum, Ephesinum, <hi>&amp;</hi> Chalcedonense, <hi>suscipere, ac venerari me fareor:</hi> That is to say in English, <hi rend="margQuotes">I confess, I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and reverence those Four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, of <hi>Nice, Constantinople, &amp;c.</hi> even as I do the Four Holy Evangelists.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>At the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, the first of the Four, the Bishops which were there Assembled, did write there Epistles to <hi>Sylvester,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                              <hi rend="margQuotes">That their decrees then made, might be confirmed by his Authority.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>At the Council kept at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all the Bishops there, were obedient to <hi>Damasus,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> He, as chief in the Council, gave Sentence against the Hereticks, <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Sabellius,</hi> and <hi>Eunomius:</hi> Which <hi>Eunomius</hi> was both an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and the first Author of that Heresie, <hi>That only Faith doth justifie.</hi> And here (by the way) it is much to be lamented, that we, the Inhabitants of this Realm are much more inclined to raise up the Errors and Sects of Ancient condemned Hereticks, than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the True, Approved Doctrine of the most Catholick and Learned Fathers of Christ his Church.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="229" facs="tcp:56964:117"/>
At the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council <hi>Nestorius</hi> the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick was condemned by <hi>Celestine</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he being chief Judge there.</p>
                           <p>At the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council, all the Bishops there Assembled, did write their humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission unto <hi>Leo,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did acknowledge him there to be their <hi>Chief Head:</hi> Six Hundred and Thirty Bishops of them.</p>
                           <p>Therefore to deny the See Apostolick, and its Authority, were to contemn and set at nought the Authority and Decrees of those noble Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, We must forsake and fly from all Canonical and Ecclesiastical Laws of Christ his Church; whereunto we have already professed our Obedience at <hi>the Font,</hi> saying, <hi>Credo Sanctam Ecclesiam Catholicam;</hi> that is, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Holy Catholick Church:</hi> Which Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle containeth, That we must receive the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and Sacraments of the same Church, obey her Laws, and live according to the same: Which Laws do depend wholly upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>See Apostolick.</hi> And like as it is here openly professed by the Judges of the Realm, that the Laws agreed upon in the Higher and Lower Houses of this Honourable Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be of small, or none effect, before the Royal Assent of the King, or Prince be given thereunto: Even so Ecclesiastical Laws made cannot bind the Universal Church of Christ,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56964:118"/>
without the Royal Assent, and Confirmation of the <hi>See Apostolick.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, We must forsake and fly from the Judgment of all other Christian Princes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Protestant or Catholick Christians, when none of them do agree with these our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth being the first that ever took upon him the Title of <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And whereas it was of late, here in this House, said, by a Nobleman, That the Title of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is of right due to a King, for that he is a King; then it would follow, That <hi>Herod</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, should be Supreme Head of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> And <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor, Supreme Head of the Church of Christ at <hi>Rome;</hi> they being both Infidels, and therefore no members of Christ his Church.</p>
                           <p>And if our Saviour Christ, at his departure from this World, should have left the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government of his Church in the hands of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and Kings, and not to have committed the same to his Apostles, how negligently then should he have left his Church!</p>
                           <p>It shall appear right well, by calling to mind, That the Emperor <hi>Constantinus Magnus</hi> was the First <hi>Christian Emperor,</hi> and was Baptized by <hi>Sylvester,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about Three hundred years after the <hi>Ascension</hi> of <hi>Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If by your Proposition, <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first Christian Emperor was the <hi>First Head,</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
                              <pb n="231" facs="tcp:56964:118"/>
                              <hi>Governor</hi> of Christ his Church, throughout his Empire; then it followeth, That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, for the space of Three Hundred years, unto the coming of this <hi>Constantine,</hi> left his Church (which he had so dearly bought by effusion of his most precious Blood) without any Head at all.</p>
                           <p>But how untrue the saying of this Nobleman was, it shall further appear by Example of <hi>Ozia,</hi> and also of King <hi>David.</hi> For King <hi>Ozia</hi> did take the <hi>Censor</hi> to do Incense to the Altar of God. The Priest <hi>Azarias</hi> did resist him, and expelled him out of the Temple, and said unto him. <hi>Non est Officii tui,</hi> Ozia, <hi>ut adoleas In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censum Domino; sed est Sacerdotum, &amp; Filiorum</hi> Aaron: <hi>Ad hujusmodi enim Officium consecrati.</hi> That is to say, <q>It is not thy Office, <hi>Ozia,</hi> to offer Incense to the Altar of God. But it is the Priests Office, and the Sons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> for they are Consecrated, and Anointed to that Office.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now I shall most humbly demand this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; When the Priest <hi>Azarias</hi> said to the King, <hi>Non est Officii tui;</hi> whether he said Truth, or not? If you answer, that he spake the Truth, then the King was not Supreme Head of the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> If you shall say, No: Why did God plague the King with Leprosie and not the Priest?</p>
                           <p>The Priest, <hi>Azarias,</hi> in resisting the King, and thrusting him out of the Temple; in so doing, did the Priest play the faithful part of a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56964:119"/>
Subject, or no? If you answer No; why then did God spare the Priest, and not spare the King? If you answer, Yea; then it is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, <hi>Ozia,</hi> in that he was a King, could not be Supreme Head of the Church.</p>
                           <p>And as touching the Example of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in bringing home the Ark of God from the Country of the <hi>Philistians</hi> to the City of <hi>David,</hi> what Supremacy, or Government of God's Ark, did King <hi>David</hi> there take upon him? Did he place himself amongst the Priests? Or take upon him any Spiritual Function unto them appertaining? Did he approach neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ark? Or yet presume to touch the same? No doubtless. For he had seen before, <hi>Ozia</hi> strucken to death by the hand of God, for the like arrogance and presumption.</p>
                           <p>And therefore King <hi>David</hi> did go before the Ark of God with his Harp, making Melody; and placed himself amongst the Minstrels, and humbly did abase himself, (being a King) as to dance and leap before the Ark of God; like as his other Subjects did: Insomuch, as his Queen <hi>Michol,</hi> King <hi>Saul</hi>'s Daughter, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and seeing this great Humility of King <hi>David,</hi> did disdain thereat. Whereunto King <hi>David,</hi> making answer, said, <hi>Ludam, &amp; vilior fiam plùs quàm factus sum, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <q>I will dance, and abase my self, more than yet I have done; and abjecting my self in mine own eyes, I shall appear more glorious with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56964:119"/>
those Handmaids, that you talk of. I will play here before my Lord; which hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen me, rather than thy Father's House.</q> And whereas Queen <hi>Michol</hi> was therefore plagued at God's hand, with perpetual Sterility and Barrenness, King <hi>David</hi> received great praise for his Humility.</p>
                           <p>Now may it please your Honours, to consider which of both these Kings Examples, shall be most convenient for your Wisdoms, to make the Queens Majesty to follow; whether the Example of Proud <hi>Ozia;</hi> moving Her, by your perswasions and Councils, to take upon her Spiritual Government; and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing her Soul to be plagued at the hand of God, as King <hi>Ozia</hi> was: or else to follow the Example of the good King <hi>David,</hi> which, in refusal of all Spiritual Government about the Ark of God, did humble himself, as I have declared unto you.</p>
                           <p>Whereunto our Sovereign Lady, the <hi>Queens</hi> Highness, of Her own nature being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; we may assure our selves, to have of Her as Humble, as Virtuous, and as Godly a Mistress to Reign over us, as ever had <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> People here in this Realm; if that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be not by your Flattery, and Dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seduced and beguiled.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, and Lastly, We must forsake, and fly from the Holy Unity of Christ's-Church: Seeing that St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that Holy Martyr, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56964:120"/>
great Clerk, doth say, that the Unity of the Church of Christ doth depend upon <hi>Peter's Authority,</hi> and his Successors. Therefore by leaping out of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ship, we must be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the Waves of Schisms, of Sects and Divisions: Because the same Holy Martyr in his Third Epistle to <hi>Cornelius</hi> testifieth, <hi>That all Heresies, Sects, and Schisms, do spring only from hence, that Men will not be obedient to the Head-Bishop of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And how true this saying of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is, we may see it most apparent to all Men that list to see, both by the Example of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and by us, the Inhabitants of this Realm of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And by this our forsaking, and flying from the Unity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency amongst many, must consequently follow: That either we must grant the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the True Church of God, or else a malignant Church. If you Answer, that it is a True Church of God, where Jesus Christ is truly taught, and his Sacraments rightly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred; how can we disburthen our selves of our forsaking, and flying from that Church, which we do confess, and acknowledge to be of God? When with that Church, which is of God, we ought to be <hi>One,</hi> and not to admit of any <hi>Separation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If you Answer, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not of God, but a Malignant Church; then it will
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56964:120"/>
follow, that we the Inhabitants of this Realm have not as yet received any Benefit of Christ; seeing we have received no Gospel, or other Doctrine, nor no other Sacraments, but what was sent unto us from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>First, in King <hi>Lucius</hi> his days, at whose humble Epistle the Holy Martyr <hi>Elutherius,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did send into this Realm two Holy Monks, <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Damianus;</hi> by whose Doctrine and Preaching, we were first brought to the knowledge of the Faith of Jesus Chrrst of his Holy Gospel, and his most Holy Sacraments.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, and Last of all, <hi>Paulus Tertius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did send hither the Lord Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> his Grace, (by Birth a Nobleman of this Land) his Legate, to restore us unto the same Faith which the Martyr, St. <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had Planted here many years before.</p>
                           <p>If therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be not of God, but a false and Malignant Church, then have we been deceived all this while; seeing the Gospel, the Doctrine, Faith, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must be of the same nature, as that Church
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56964:121"/>
is, from whence it, and they came; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in relinquishing, and forsaking that Church, the Inhabitants of this Realm shall be forced to seek further for another Gospel of Christ, other Doctrine, other Faith and Sacraments than we have hitherto received: Which will breed such a Schism, and Error in Faith, as was never in any Christian Realm. And therefore of your Wisdoms worthy of Consideration, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely to be pondered, and be provided for, before you pass this Act of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> Thus much touching the First chief Point.</p>
                           <p>Now to the Second Deliberation, wherein I promised to move your Honors, to consider, What this <hi>Supremacy</hi> is, which we go about, by vertue of this Act, to give unto the <hi>Queen,</hi> and wherein it doth consist; whether in <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Government, or <hi>Temporal.</hi> But if <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> (as these words in the Act do import, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head of the Church of England, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and next unto God;)</hi> Then it would be considered, in what Points this <hi>Spiritual</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment doth consist? and the Points being well known, it would be considered, Whether this House hath <hi>Authority</hi> to grant them, and her Highness <hi>Ability</hi> to receive them.</p>
                           <p>And as concerning the Points, <hi>wherein Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Government doth consist,</hi> I have, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, and the whole course of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereupon (as to my Vocation belongeth) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served these Four, as chief among many others:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56964:121"/>
whereof the first is, The Power to loose and bind Sins. When our Saviour, in ordaining <hi>Peter</hi> to be Chief, and Head-Governor of his Church, said unto him, <hi>Tibi dabo Claves Regni Coelorum, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>To thee will I give the the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Now it would be considered by your Wisdoms, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whether you have sufficient Authority to grant unto her Majesty this first Point of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government; and to say unto Her, <hi>Tibi dabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.</hi> To <hi>Thee will we give the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> If you say Yea; then do we require the sight of Warrant and Commission, by the Virtue of God's Word. And if you say No: then you may be well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, and perswade your selves, that you have not sufficient Authority to make her Highness <hi>Supream Head of the Church of Christ</hi> here in this Realm.</p>
                           <p>The Second Point of <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> is gathered out of these words of our Saviour Christ, spoken to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 20th. Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, <hi>Pasce,—&amp; Pasce—&amp; Pasce,</hi> That is, <hi>Feed my Lambs, Feed my Lambs, Feed my Sheep:</hi> Now, whether your Honors have Authority by this Court of Parliament, to say unto our Sovereign Lady, <hi>Pasce, &amp; Pasce, &amp; Pasce, &amp;c.</hi> That is to say, <hi>Feed you the Flock of Christ,</hi> you must shew your Warrant and Commission for it. And further it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Her Majesty, being a Woman by
<pb facs="tcp:56964:122"/>
Birth and Nature, is not qualified by God's word, to feed the Flock of Christ, appears most plainly by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in this wise, <hi>Taceant Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieres in Ecclesiis, sicut &amp; lex dicit. Ler Women be silent in the Church:</hi> for <hi>it is not Lawful for them to speak,</hi> but <hi>to be in subjection,</hi> as <hi>the Law saith.</hi> And it followeth in the same place. <hi>Turpe est enim, Mulieres loqui in Ecclesiâ,</hi> that is, for <hi>that it is not seemly for a Woman to speak in the Church.</hi> And in his second Epistle to <hi>Timothy, Dominari in virum, sed esse silentes;</hi> that is to say, I allow not that a Woman be a Teacher, or to be above her Husband, but to keep her self in silence. Therefore it appears likewise, as your Honors have not Authority to give her Highness this second Point of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Government, to Feed the Flock of Christ: So by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, her Highness may not intermeddle her self with the same. And therefore She cannot be <hi>Supream Head of the Church, here</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Third chief Point of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is gathered out of those words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ, spoken to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 22th. Chapter of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel, <hi>Ego rogavi pro Te, ut non deficiat fides Tua; &amp; Tu aliquando conversus, confirma fratres Tuos.</hi> That is, <hi>I Prayed for Thee, that thy Faith shall not fail; and thou being converted, Confirm thy Brethren,</hi> and ratifie them in wholesome Doctrine, and Administration of the Sacraments; which are
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56964:122"/>
the Holy Instruments of God, so Instituted and Ordained for our Sanctification; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them his Grace is not to be received. But to Preach, or to administer the Sacraments, a Woman may not be admitted to do; neither may she be <hi>Supream</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Church.</p>
                           <p>The Fourth and Last chief point of <hi>Spiritual Government,</hi> which I promised to Note unto you, doth consist in the <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Punishment</hi> of all such, as shall approve themselves, not to be the Obedient Children of Christ's Church.</p>
                           <p>Of which Authority our Saviour Christ speaks in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel, in the 18th. Chapter, saying, <q>If your Brother offending will not hear your charitable admonition, whether secretly at first, or yet before one, or two Witnesses, then we must complain of him to the Church, and <hi>If he will not hear the Church, let him be taken as an Heathen or Publican.</hi>
                              </q> 
                           </p>
                           <p>So the Apostle did <hi>Excommunicate</hi> the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Fornicator,</hi> that was among the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians;</hi> and by the Authority of his Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: unto which Apostles, Christ ascending into Heaven, did leave the whole <hi>Spiritual</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church, as it appeareth by those plain words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Chap. 4th. saying, <hi>Ipse dedit Ecclesiae suae, &amp;c. He hath given to his Church, some to be Apostles, some Evangelists, some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
                              <pb n="240" facs="tcp:56964:123"/>
                              <hi>and Doctors,</hi> for <hi>consummation of the Saints,</hi> to <hi>the work of the Ministry,</hi> for <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Body of Christ.</hi> But a Woman in the degrees of the Church, is not called to be an Apostle, nor Evangelist; nor to be a Pastor (as much as to say, a Shepheard) nor a Doctor, or a Preacher. Therefore she cannot be <hi>Supream Head</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Militant</hi> Church; nor yet of any part thereof. For this High Government God hath appointed only to the Bishops, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of his People; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth in these words, in the 20th. Chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> saying, <hi>Attendite vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, &amp; universo gregi, &amp;c.</hi> And thus much I have here said, right Honorable, and my very good Lords, against this Act of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> for the discharge of my poor Conscience, and for the Love, and Fear, and Dread, that I chiefly owe unto God, to my Sovereign Lord and Lady the Queens Majesties Highness, and to your Honors All. Where otherwise, without mature consideration of all these Premises, your Honors shall never be able to shew your faces before your enemies, in this matter; being so strange a spectacle and example in Christ's Church, as in this Realm is only to be found, and in no other Christian Realm.</p>
                           <p>Thus humbly beseeching your Honors, to take in good part, this my rude and plain Speech, which here I have used, of much Zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent good will: And now I shall not trouble

your <hi>Honors</hi> any longer.</p>

                  <p>NOw for the better exercising, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Jurisdiction thus acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Crown, there was this Clause put into the Act, <q>That it should be Lawful for the Queen to give Power, to such as she thought fit, to exercise all manner of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and to visit, reform, redress, order, correct and amend all kind of Errors, Heresies, Schisms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With this <hi>Proviso</hi> notwithstanding, that nothing should from thenceforth be accounted <hi>Heresie</hi> but what was so adjudged in the Holy Scripture, or in one of the four first General Councils, or

in any other National, or Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, determining according to the word of God; or finally which should be so adjudged in the time to come, by the Court of Parliament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the first Foundation of the <hi>High Commission Court:</hi> And from hence issued that Commission, by which the Queens ministers proceeded in that visitation, in the first year of her Reign, for rectifying all such things as they found amiss.</p>
                  <p>There also passed another Act, for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and imposing the Book of Common-Prayer, and Administration of Sacraments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to such Alterations, and Corrections, as were made therein, by those that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to review it.

                  <p>In the first <hi>Liturgy</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our Lord's Body was delivered with

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56964:125"/>
of Christ's Body and Blood.</q> (This <hi>Rubrick</hi> is again lately inserted.)</p>
                  <p>And to come up closer to those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was ordered by the Queens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, That the Sacramental Bread (which the Book required only to be made of the finest Flower) should be made round, in the fashion of the Wafers, used in the time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She also Ordered, that the Lord's Table should be placed where the Altar stood; and that the accustomed Reverence should be made <hi>at the Name of Jesus:</hi> Musick retained in the Church, and all the other Festivals observed, with their several Eves.</p>
                  <p>By which compliances, and the expunging of the passages before mentioned, the Book was made more plausible: And that it might pass the better in both Houses, when it came to the Vote, it was thought requisite, That a Disputation should be held about some Points, which were most likely to be keked at.</p>
                  <p>Two Speeches were made against this Book in the House of Peers, by <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Feckenham;</hi> and one against the Queens Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, by the Archbishop of <note place="margin">This Speech you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had at large.</note> 
                     <hi>York:</hi> But they prevailed little in both Points by the Power of their Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>In the Convocation, which accompanied this present Parliament, there was little done; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56964:125"/>
they despared of doing any good to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Cause.</p>
                  <p>The chief thing they did, was a Declaration of their Judgments in some certain Points: which at that time were conceived fit to be commended to the sight of the Parliament; that is to say,</p>
                  <p>First, That in the Sacrament of the Altar, by vertue of Christ's Assistance, after the words of Consecration are duly pronounced by the Priest, the Natural Body of Christ, conceived of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is <hi>really present</hi> under the <hi>species</hi> of Bread and Wine. As also his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Blood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That after the Consecration, there remains not the Substance of Bread and Wine; nor any Substance, but the Substance of God and Man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly that the true Body of Christ, and his Blood, is offered for a Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Quick, and Dead.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Supream Power of Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Governing the Militant Church of Christ, and of Confirming their Brethren, is given to <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, and to his lawful Successors in the See Apostolick, as unto the Vicars of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That the Authority to handle and define such things, as belong to Faith, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and Ecclesiastical Discipline, hath hitherto ever belonged, and only ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56964:126"/>
unto the Pastors of the Church, whom the Holy Spirit hath placed in the Church; and not unto Lay-men.</p>
                  <p>These Articles they caused to be Engr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But, they prevailed no further with the Queen, or House of Peers, when imparted to them, than that (possibly) they might help forwards the aforementioned Disputation.</p>

And on the otherside, many were raised to great preferments, who having spent their time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And not to speak of private Opinions, nothing was more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in them, than their zeal against Popery.</p>
                  <p>On which account, we find the Queens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to pass amongst the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi> though some-what more moderate than the rest: And <hi>Cartwright</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to prove an unextinguished Fire-brand to the Church of <hi>England: Wittington,</hi> the chef Ring-leader of the <hi>Frankfort-</hi>Schismaticks, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto the Deanry of <hi>Durham:</hi> From thence encouraging <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Goodman,</hi> in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Presbytery, and Sedition in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.

of the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> deprived soon after for throwing down the Altar, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing the Vestments of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> being informed of these proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, labours to Perswade the Queen from going on with these Alterations in Religion. But that not succeeding, She sent out, by the Advice of her Council, a certain Body of <hi>Injunctions;</hi> the same in effect with those, which had been published in the First of King <hi>Edward;</hi> but more accommodated to the temper of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more singular in them, than the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere course taken about Ministers Marriages. But this was long since worn out of use, and not much observed when it first came out: As if it had been published, only in way of Caution, to make the Clergy-men more wary in the choice of their Wives, rather than with any purpose of pursuing it to an Execution.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Position of the Holy Table, it was ordered thus by these Injunctions, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Altar should be taken down but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-sight of the Curate of the Church, or the Church-wardens, or one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And that the Holy Table, in every Church should be decently made, and set in the place where the Altar stood, and there common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered, as thereto belonged, and as should be appointed by the Visitors: And so to stand,

saving when the Communion of the Sacrament was to be Administred: At which time the same should be placed within the Quire, or Chancel, as whereby the Minister might be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently heard of the Communicants, in his Prayer and Administration; and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants also more conveniently, and in more num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Communicate with the said Minister.

                  <p>By these <hi>Injunctions</hi> she made way for her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation, regulated by the Book of Articles. By which Articles, all Images were removed out of the Church, and all the Roods, and other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, which had been taken out of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, were burnt in St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, <hi>Cheapside,</hi> and other places of the City.

                  <p>IN the Second year of Her Reign, some days after the Deprivation of the former Bishops, She Elected other Bishops, to satisfie the world that She intended to preserve Episcopal Government.</p>
                  <p>But why this was deferred so long, may be a question. Some think it was, That She might satisfie her self, by putting the Church into a posture by her Visitation, before she passed it over to the care of the Bishops. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That she was so enamoured with the Power and Title of <hi>Supream Governess,</hi> that she could not deny Her self the contentment in the exercise of it, which the present Interval afforded. And it is possible enough, that both or either of these Considerations might have some influence upon Her. But the main cause for keeping the Episcopal Sees in so long a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, must be found elsewhere.</p>

An Act had passed in the late Parliament <hi>(Anno Reg. Eliz.</hi> 1.) which never had the confidence to appear in Print: In the Preamble whereof it was declared, That by the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religious Houses, many Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tythes, and portions of Tythes, had been invested in the Crown, which the Queen could not well dismember from it, in regard of the present low condition, in which she found the Crown at her coming to it: And thereupon it was Enacted, that in the vacancy of any Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick, or Bishoprick, it should be lawful for the Queen to issue out a Commission under the great Seal, for taking a Survey of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereditaments, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Episcopal Sees belonging; and upon the return of such Survey, to take into Her hands any of the said Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, &amp;c. as to Her seemed good, giving to the said Archbishops, and Bishops, as much <hi>Annual</hi> Rents, to be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Impropriations, Tythes, and portions of Tythes, as the said Castles, Mannors, Lands, &amp;c. did amount unto: The Church-Lands certified according to the ancient Rents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consideration of the Casualties, or other Perquisites of the Court, which belonged to them: The retribution made in Pensions, Tythes, and portions of Tythes, extended to the utmost value, from which no other profit was to be expected, than the Rent it self: Which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56964:130"/>
Act being not to take effect till the end of the Parliament, the Interval (between the end of that Parliament, the deprivation of the old Bishops, and the Consecration of the new) was to be taken up in the execution of such Surveys, and making such Advantages of them, as most redounded to the profit of the Queen, and her Courtiers. Upon which ground, as all the Bishops Sees were so long kept vacant, before any one of them was filled; so in the following times, they were kept void, one after another, as occasion served, till the best Flowers in the Garden of the Church, had been culled out of it.</p>
                  <p>There was another Clause in the said Statutes, by which the Patrimony of the Church was as much Dilapidated, even after the restoring of the Bishops, as it was in the times of vacancy. For by that Clause, all Bishops were restrained from making any Grants of their Farms and Mannors for more than One and Twenty years, or Three Lives at the most, except it were to the Queen, her Heirs, and Successors: And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence, they might be granted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Her hungry Courtiers in Fee-farm, or for a Lease of Fourscore and Nineteen years, as it pleased the parties. By which means <hi>Crediton</hi> was dismembred from the See of <hi>Excester;</hi> and the goodly Mannor of <hi>Sherbourn</hi> from that of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> Many fair Mannors were likewise Alienated for ever, from the rich Sees of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:56964:130"/>
                     <hi>Ely,</hi> and indeed what not? Moreover, when the rest of the Episcopal Sees were suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with new Bishops; yet <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi> were not so soon provided, That they might afford on <hi>Michaelmas-</hi>Rent more to the Queens Exchequer, before the Lord Tresurer could give way to a new Incumbent.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this great Havock that was made of the Bishopricks, yet Episcopacy was now setled, with the retaining of many Rites and Ceremonies belonging to <hi>Catholick Religion:</hi> Whereof one was, that she had caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Massy Crucifix of Silver to be placed upon the midst of the Altar, in her Chappel. But this so displeased Sir <hi>Francis Knolls,</hi> the <hi>Queens</hi> neer Kinsman, by the <hi>Caries,</hi> (a great Zelot for the Reformation) that he caused it to be broken in pieces.</p>
                  <p>There was at this time a Sermon preached in defence of the <hi>Real presence:</hi> For which the Queen openly gave the Preacher Thanks for his Pains and Piety. </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But leaving them, and their designs, to some other time, we must next look upon the Aid, which the <hi>Queen</hi> sent to those of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (but carried under the pretence of dislodging such <hi>French</hi> Forces as were Garrison'd there.) Such of the <hi>Scots</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a Reformation of Religion, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the Queens absence, the easiness of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and want of Power in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56964:131"/>
Queen Regent to suppress their practices, had put themselves into a Body; headed by some of the Nobility, they take unto themselves the Name of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> managing their own Affairs apart from the rest of the Kingdom. The principal Leaders of the <hi>Party,</hi> well followed by the Common People, put themselves into <hi>Perth,</hi> and there begin to stand upon higher terms than before they did. The news whereof occasioneth <hi>Knox</hi> to leave his Sanctuary in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> and joyn himself unto the Lords <hi>of the Congregation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Perth</hi> he goes into the Pulpit, and falls so bitterly on Images, that the People (in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular fury) deface all the Images in that Church, and presently demolish all the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houses within that City. Those of <hi>Couper</hi> (hearing of it) forthwith destroy all the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and pull down the Altars in that Church also. Preaching at <hi>Craile,</hi> he enveighed sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the <hi>Queen-Regent,</hi> and vehemently stirred up the people to joyn together for the expulsion of the <hi>French:</hi> Which drew after it the like destruction of all Altars, and Images, as was made before at <hi>Perth,</hi> and <hi>Couper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like followed on his Preaching at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> also; the Religious Houses being pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down, as well as the Images, and laid so flat, that there was nothing left in the form of a building. Inflamed by the same Fire-brand, they burned down the Rich Monastery of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56964:132"/>
                     <hi>Schone,</hi> and ruined that of <hi>Cambus-braneth,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished all the Altars, Images, and Convents of Religious persons in <hi>Sterling, Lithgow, Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough, Edenburgh,</hi> making themselves masters of the last, and putting up their own Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into all the Pulpits of the City, not suffering the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> to have the use of One Church only for her Devotions.</p>
                  <p>Nor staid they here, but being carried on by the same ill Spirit, they pass an Act amongst themselves, for Depriving the <hi>Queen-Regent</hi> of all place and Power in the Publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Concerning which the Oracle being first consulted, returned this answer, sufficiently ambiguous, as all Oracles are, that is to say, <q>That the iniquity of the Queen Regent ought not to with draw their hearts from the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to their Sovereigns: Nor did he wish any such sentence to be pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her; but when she should change her course, and submit her self to good counsel, there should place be left unto her, of regress to the same Honors, from which, for good causes, she ought to be deprived.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Act is intimated to the <hi>Queen-Regent;</hi> who ordered her business so well, that they were quickly brought to great extremity; and had been soon suppressed, but for the Succors they received from <hi>England.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then she requests, that she might confer with her <hi>Confessor,</hi> and <hi>Melvyn</hi> her Steward: But the first would not be granted her. The Bishop, or Dean of <hi>Peterborough</hi> they offered her; but them she refused.</p>
                  <p>The Earls being departed from her, she gave order that Supper should be hastned; where she eat, (as she used to do), <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>sparingly:</hi> And perceiving her men and women-Servants, to lament and weep, she comforted them, and bid them rejoyce rather, that she was now to depart out of a world of misery.</p>

                  <p>At her wonted hour she went to bed; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few hours sleep, awaking, spent the rest of the night in her devotion.

                  <p>Then turning her self to the Earls, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested, that her Servants might stand by at her death: Which the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> was very loath to grant, for fear of Superstition: To whom she said, <hi>Fear nothing: These desire only to give me my last farewel: And I know, the Queen, my Sister, would not refuse me so small a request.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, the two Earls leading the way, with the Sheriff of the County, she came to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; which was set up at the upper end of the Hall, where was a Chair, a Cushion, and a Block, all covered with Mourning.</p>
                  <p>Then she, falling upon her knees, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the <hi>Crucisix</hi> in both her hands, prayed with her Servants out of the Office of our Lady.</p>

                  <p>WE shall find the <hi>Queen</hi> there as active in advancing the Reformation, as she had been in either of the other Kingdoms.

all the Monasteries, and Religious Houses.</p>
                  <p>In matters of Doctrine, and Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as there was nothing done by him, so neither much endeavoured in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: It being thought (perhaps) unsafe, to provoke that people, in the King's Minority, considering with how many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he was else here exercised. If any thing were done there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n, it was rather done by tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than command. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having setled her Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the protection of the Scots, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her self obliged in point of Piety to promote the Reformation in that Kingdom likewise. A Parliament is therefore held; where pass'd an Act, restoring to the Crown the Jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Ecclesiastical persons. By which Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute were established both the <hi>Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> and the <hi>High Commission,</hi> as before in England.</p>
                  <p>There also pass'd an Act for the <hi>Unifor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The people are required by that Statute, under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral penalties, to frequent their Churches, and to be frequent at the reading of the English <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> which they understand no more, than they do the <hi>Mass.</hi> By which means the <hi>Irish</hi> were
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56964:135"/>
not only kept in continual ignorance, as to the Doctrines and Devotions of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but we have likewise furnished the <hi>Papist</hi> with an excellent Argument against our selves, for having the Divine Service celebrated in such a language as the people do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
                  <p>There also pass'd another Statute for restoring to the Crown the first Fruits, and Twenty parts of all Ecclesiastical promotions; as also of all Impropriated Parsonages; of which there are more in number, than those Rectories, which have Cure of Souls. The like Act pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the Restitution of all Lands belonging to the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with the Annulling of all Leases, and other Grants, made by the late Lord <hi>Prior</hi> of the same.</p>
                  <p>The Bishops of <hi>Ireland,</hi> finding how things went in <hi>England,</hi> and knowing, that the like Alteration would ensue amongst themselves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make such use of the present times, as to enrich their Friends and Kindred, by the the spoyl of their Churches. To which end they so dissipated the Revenues of their several Bishopricks, by long Leases, Fee-farms, and plain Alienations, that to some of their Sees, they left no more than a Rent of Five Marks <hi>Per Annum:</hi> To others, a bare yearly Rent of Forty shillings, to the high displeasure of God, the reproach of Religion, and the perpetual ignominy of themselves, for that horrible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.

But the Queen had set up her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, to go forward with the Change. Wherefore all was lost labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:56964:137"/>
But all this while, there was no care taken to suppress the practices of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> who secretly endeavored to subvert the English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. For whilst the Prelates of the Church of <hi>England</hi> bent all their forces towards the confuting of the Papists, another Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; which seemed not openly to aim at the Churches Doctrine, but quarrelled rather at some Rites, and Extrinsecals of it. Their purpose was to take in the Outworks of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion first, before they levelled their Artillery at the Fort it self.</p>
                  <p>The Schismaticks of <hi>Frankfort</hi> had no sooner heard of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Death, but they make what hast they could for <hi>England,</hi> in hope of fishing better for themselves, in a troubled water, than a quiet: Followed not long after by the Brethren of the Separation; which retired from thence to <hi>Geneva;</hi> who, having left some few behind, to compleat their Notes upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to make up so many of the Psalms in English Meeter, as had been left unfinished by <hi>Hopkins,</hi> hastned as fast homewards as the others. But notwithstanding all their hast, they came not time enough to effect their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, either in reference to the Liturgy, or Episcopal Government; in which the Queen was so resolved, that they were not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in either project.</p>
                  <p>It grieved them at the Heart, that their own Prayers might not be made the rule of Worship
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56964:137"/>
in their Congregations, and that they might not Lord it here in their several Parishes, as <hi>Calvin</hi> did at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some friends they had about the Queen, and <hi>Calvin</hi> was resolved to make use of all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and credit, both with Her and <hi>Cecil,</hi> (as appears by his Letters unto both) to advance their ends: and he was seconded therein by <hi>Peter Martyr;</hi> who thought his Interest in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be greater then <hi>Calvin</hi>'s; though his name was not so eminent in other places. But the Quen had fixed her self, on her resolution, of keeping up some outward Splendor of a Church. When therefore they saw the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy imposed by Act of Parliament, and Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Sees supplyed with Bishops, nothing seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more convenient to them, than to revive the quarrels raised in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, against Caps and Surplices, and such particulars, as had been then questioned in the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</p>
                  <p>And herein they were seconded (as before in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time) by the same <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> as appears by his Letters to a Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less friend. To which he added (in another of his Letters to the same friend also) his dislike of the same, and other Points proposed unto him: as touching the Cap, the Episcopal Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, the Patrimony of the Church, the manner of proceeding to be held against Papists, the Perambulation used in Rogation-week; with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56964:138"/>
many other such Points, in which his judgment was desired.</p>
                  <p>But these Helps being too far off, and not to be consulted upon all occasions, without a greater loss of time, than would consist with the impatience of their desires, they fell upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther project, more to their purpose, than the decrying of the Liturgy, or the quarrels about the Cap, and Vestments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grindal,</hi> the new Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> was known to have a great respect for <hi>Calvin:</hi> The business therefore was so ordered, that by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> Letters to <hi>Grindal,</hi> and the friends they had about the <hi>Queen,</hi> way was given to such of the <hi>French Nation,</hi> as had repaired hither, to enjoy the Freedom of their own Religion, and to have a Church unto themselves. They could not but remember those many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which <hi>John à Lasco,</hi> and his Church of Strangers, afforded to the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers, in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: and they despaired not of the like, or greater, if a <hi>French</hi> Church were setled upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in some part of <hi>London.</hi> Now a Church being granted them, we must not wonder, if we find dangerous consequences to ensue upon it. For what else is the setting up of a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> in a Church Founded and Established by the Rules of Episcopacy, than the Erecting of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in the midst of a <hi>Monarchy?</hi> Which <hi>Calvin</hi> well knew, and thereupon gave
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56964:138"/>
                     <hi>Grindal</hi> thanks for his favor in it: Of whom they afterwards served themselves upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. Upon the news of which success, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> repaired into <hi>England,</hi> planting themselves in the Sea-towns, and openly professing the Reformed Religion; under which covert they disguised their several Heterodoxies, and Blasphemous Dotages; some of them proving to be Anabaptists; others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with unsound Opinions, of as ill a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but all endeavoring to disperse their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Doctrines, and to empoyson the People, amongst whom they lived, to encrease their Sects.</p>
                  <p>And although a Proclamation was set out for their Banishment, yet many of them lurked in <hi>England,</hi> without fear of discovery; especially after the Erecting of so many <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, in the Maritime parts; which they infected with some of their phrenzies, as at this time they had <hi>London;</hi> and occasioned such Disputes amongst them upon that account, that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was necessitated to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself, for the composing those Heats and Differences, which had grown amongst them.</p>
                  <p>There was likewise, at the same time, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proclamation published, to hinder and stop a certain Abuse, which was this, The Queen, having given Command, by her <hi>Injunctions,</hi> in the year foregoing, for destroying, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56964:139"/>
away all Shrines, and Coverings of Shrines, all Tables, Candlesticks, Trindals, and Rolls of Wax; together, with all Pictures, Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that there was to remain no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the same, either in the Walls, Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windows, or else-where, whether it were in Churches, or private Houses; it is said, that they proceeded, in the Execution of this, even to the breaking down all Coats of Arms, to the tearing off of all the Brass of the Tombs and Monuments of the Dead. And being given to understand, that Bells were blessed in time of <hi>Popery,</hi> and that even the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had been abused to Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, their Zeal transported them to sell the Bells, to turn the Steeples into Dove-coats, and to rob the Churches of those sheets of Lead, with which they were covered. </p>

                  <p>IN the beginning of this year were filled up all such Episcopal Sees, as were vacant. There was one <hi>Scambler,</hi> made Bishop of <hi>Peterborough.</hi> But during the vacancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Sir <hi>William Cecill</hi> possessed himself of the Mannors in <hi>Soak,</hi> which belonged unto it.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Scambler</hi>'s readiness to confirm the same Mannors to him, he preferred him to the See of <hi>Norwich.</hi>

                  <p>Dr <hi>Thomas Young,</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> was translated to the See of <hi>York;</hi> which was done in an unlucky hour to that City.

                  <p>But neither the filling up of those vacant Sees, nor the Queens Proclamation for the Banishing of Sectaries, could free the Land from those dangerous Inmates, or preserve the Church from the Contagion of their poysonous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>

Now when Men began to cast about, to find out, what might be the occasion of this misfortune, The generality of the <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> or <hi>Genevian</hi> party, affirmed it to be a just Judgment of God upon an old Idolatrous Fabrick, not throughly Reformed, and purged from its Superstitions; and would have been content, that all other

And they drove on so fast upon it, that in some places they had taken down the steps where the Altar stood, and brought the Table into the midst of the Church. In others, they laid aside the Ancient use of God-fathers and God-mothers, in the Administration of Baptism, and left the answering for the Child to the charge of the Father: the Weekly <hi>Fasts,</hi> the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and all other Days of <hi>Abstinence,</hi> were look'd upon as Superstitious observations.</p>
                  <p>No Fast by them allowed of, but occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally only; and them too of their own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the like course they took also with Festival Days; neglecting those which had been instituted, as Human Inventions, not fit to be retained in a Reformed Church.</p>
                  <p>And finally, that they might bring in their <hi>Outlandish Doctrines,</hi> with such Foreign usages, they had procured some of the inferior Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, to impose upon their several Parishes certain new Books of Sermons, and <hi>Expositions</hi> of the Holy Scripture.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To stop these proceedings, the Arch-Bishop with Advice of some of the Bishops, set forth a Book of Orders. But notwithstanding these Orders, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> drive on their designs; as appears by this following Relation of Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> pag. 154.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The <hi>Genevians</hi> had already begun to blow the Coals, and brought Fuel to them: But it was only for the Burning of Caps and Rochets.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56964:142"/>
The <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> was so fortified by Act of Parliament, that there was no assaulting of it. And as to Episcopal Government, it was so interwoven, and incorporated with the Laws of the Land, so twisted in with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Crown, and the Royal Interest, that they must first be in a capacity of tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Laws, and the Crown together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could attempt the destruction of it. But Caps and Tippets, Rochets and Lawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleeves, and Canonical Coats, seemed to be built upon no better Foundation, than Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious custom, some old Popish Canon, or, at the best, some Temporary Injunction of the Queens devising, which could not have the Power, and effect of Law. This Game they had in chase, in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time; which now they are resolved to follow to the very last.</p>
                  <p>The obstinacy of these Men, in matter of Ceremony, prompted the Bishops to make tryal of their Orthodoxy in Points of Doctrine. Whereupon the Articles of Religion lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, were required to be subscribed to in all places, with threatning no less than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation to such as willfully refused. Many there were, that boggled at it, (as they all did); but yet not so perversly, nor in such great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as when their faction was grown strong, and improved to multitudes.</p>
                  <p>Some stumbled at it, in regard of the first clause, added to the Twentieth Article, about
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56964:143"/>
the Authority of the Church. Others in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Thirty Sixth, touching the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of Archbishops and Bishops. Some thought they Attributed more Authority to the Supream Magistrate, <hi>over all Persons and Causes,</hi> both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> than could consist with that <hi>Independency</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated unto his <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and other Churches of the Platform. And others looked upon the <hi>Homilies,</hi> as beggerly Rudiments, scarce Milk for Babes: But by no means to be looked upon as Meat for a stronger stomack. In general, thought by the <hi>Genevians</hi> and <hi>Zuinglian Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,</hi> to have too much in them of the Pope, or too little of <hi>Calvin;</hi> and therefore no way to be subscribed unto.</p>
                  <p>Of which number, none so much remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as <hi>Father John Fox,</hi> the <hi>Martyrologist,</hi> who had before appeared in the Schism at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> and left that Church, when <hi>Cox</hi> had got the better in it, to retire to <hi>Geneva:</hi> Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now called upon to subscribe, (that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which was had of his parts, and Piety, might advance the work,) he is said to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Bishop, carrying the New-Testament in Greek with him; before whom he spake these words. <q>To this Book I will subscribe; and if this will not serve, take my Prebend'ry at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the only Preferment which I hold in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and much good may it do you.</q>

But notwithstanding this refractory Answer, so much kindness was shewed to him, that he both kept his resolution, and place together.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Genevians,</hi> for the greater countenance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their inconformity, had stirred up the most eminent Divines of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian,</hi> or <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, to declare in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their doings. And it appears also by remembrances in some Authors, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> apprehending some neglect from Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecill,</hi> in making either no return, or a return, which signified nothing, to his first Addresses, had laid aside his care of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> whilst he lived, conceived himself to have some Interest in this Church, in which he had enjoyed such a good preferment; but more in some particular Persons and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, who seemed to depend upon his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ask counsel of him, as their surest Oracle, in which, how much he countenanced the Faction in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, both by his Practice and Pen, and what encouragement he gave them in this present Reign, hath been shewn before. But how much he was out-gone by <hi>Beza</hi> (who next usurped a Super-intenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over all the Churches of this Island) may be seen hereafter.</p>
                  <p>All that shall now be said of either of them, or of altogether, shall be briefly this, That this poor Church might better have wanted their best helps in Points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> than have

                  <p>THis Summer, in a Progress, the Queen came to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where were sown the seeds of those Divisions, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions, with which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been continually distracted to this very day. For so it happened, that one <hi>Preston</hi> and <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> were appointed to hold a Disputation: In which the First was both liked, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Her; the Other receiving neither reward nor commendation: Which so incensed the proud man, that he retired to <hi>Geneva:</hi> Where
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56964:144"/>
having throughly informed himself in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, both of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> wherein the Churches of that Platform differed from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he returned home, with an intent to repair his credit, or rather to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a name, by raising such a fire, and such combustions in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as never were to be extinguished, but by the immediate hand of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The next considerable Action, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on the Queens Reception at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was the preferring of Sir <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> the Second Son, then living, of the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> to the Titles of <hi>Lord Denbigh,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Leicester.</hi> She had before Elected him into the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> made him Master of her Horse, and Chancellor of the University of <hi>Oxon;</hi> suffered him to carry a great sway in all Affairs, both of Court and Council; and given unto him the fair Mannor of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> being conceived to be one of the goodliest Territories in <hi>England.</hi> And now She adds unto these Honors, the goodly Castle and Mannor of <hi>Kenelworth,</hi> part of the parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Duchy of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> Advanced unto which height, he engrossed unto himself the disposing of all Offices in the Court and State, and of all Preferments in the Church; proving, in fine, so unappeasable in his Malice, and unsatiable in his Lusts; so Sacrilegious in his Rapines, so false in Promises, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

And that his Monstrous Vices (most insupportable in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other but himself) might either be conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, or not complained of, he cloaks them with a seeming zeal to the true Religion, and made himself Head of the <hi>Puritan Faction:</hi> Who spared no pains in seting forth his praises upon all occasions: Nor was he wanting to caress them, after such a manner, as he found most agreeable to those Holy Hypocrites; using no other language in his Speech, and Letters, than pure Scripture-phrase; in which he was become so dextrous, as if he had received the same Inspirations with the Sacred Pen-men.</p>

to those Eminent Honors, to make him, in some sort, capable of a <hi>Queens</hi> Affections.

For his Name was much Reverenced, not only by those of his own party; but by many others, grave, and moderate men, who did not look at first, into the dangers, which ensued upon it. His Platform at <hi>Geneva</hi> was made the only Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, by which all Reformed Churches were to frame their Government.

                  <p>THis year the <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Faction began to be first known by the name of <hi>Puritans:</hi> Which name hath ever since been appropriated to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their pretending to a greater Purity in the Service of God, than was <hi>held forth</hi> unto them (as they gave it out) in the <hi>Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book;</hi> and to a greater opposition to the Rites and Usages of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than was agreeable to the Constitution of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But this Purity was accompanied with such Irreverence; this opposion drew along with it so much licentiousness, as gave great scandal and offence to all men: So that it was high time to give a check to those Disorders and Confusions, which by their practises, and their Preachings, they had produced; and thereby laid the ground of that woful Schism, which soon after followed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:56964:146"/>
For the preventing these Disorders for the future, a <hi>Protestation</hi> was devised to be taken by all Parsons, Vicars, and Curates; by which they were required to declare and promise,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they would not preach, nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly interpret, but only read that which was appointed by publick Authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they would use sobriety in Apparel, and especially in the Church at Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, according to Order appointed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they would not openly medle with any Artificers Occupation, as covetously to seek a Gain thereby; having in Ecclesiastical Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Twenty Nobles, or above, by the year: Which <hi>Protestation,</hi> if it either had been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pressed upon all the Clergy, (as perhaps it was not) or been better kept by them that took it, the Church might, questionless, have been saved from those Distractions, which by the <hi>Puritan-Innovators</hi> were occasioned in it. </p>

               </argument>
               <head>Dr. <hi>Heylyn's</hi> Conclusion of his History.</head>
               <q>
                  <p>THus we have seen the publick Liturgy confirmed in Parliament; with divers Penalties on all those, who either did reproach it, or neglect to use it, or wilfully with-draw their attendance from it: The Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the Church declared in the Book of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; External matters in Officiating God's Publick Service, and the Apparel of the Clergy, regulated by the Book of Orders, and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements; the Episcopal Government setled. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is therefore now fixed on her Natural Pillars of <hi>Doctrine, Government,</hi> and <hi>Worship;</hi> not otherwise to have been shaken, than by the <hi>blind zeal</hi> of such furious <hi>Sampsons,</hi> as were resolved, to pull it on their own heads, rather than to suffer it to stand.</p>
                  <p>And here it will be time to conclude this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story; having taken a brief view of the State of this Church, with all the Aberration from
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56964:147"/>
its first Constitution, as it stood at this time, when the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction had begun to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb its Order. And that this may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested with a greater certainty, I will speak it in the words of one who lived, and writ his knowledge of it, at this time. I mean <hi>John Rastel,</hi> in his Answer to the Bishops Challenge: Who, though he were a <hi>Papist,</hi> and a <hi>Priest,</hi> yet, I conceive, he hath faithfully delivered too many sad Truths in these particulars.</p>
                  <p>Three Books he writ within the compass of Three years, against Bishop <hi>Jewel:</hi> In one of which he makes this Address unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And though you, Mr. <hi>Jewel,</hi> (as I have heard say) do take the Bread into your hands, when you celebrate solemnly, yet thousands there are of your inferior Ministers, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it as death, to be bound to any such External Fashion. And your order of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Communion, is so unadvisedly conceived, that every man is left unto his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rule or Canon, whether he will take the Bread into his hands, or let it stand at the end of the Table, where it pleases the Sexton, or Parish-Clerk to set them, <bibl>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, as to the Communion; now, as to Altars, he hath these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In the Primitive Church, Altars were used amongst Christians; upon which they offered the unbloody Sacrifice of Christ's Body; yet your Company, (to declare what Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56964:148"/>
they are of Antiquity) do account i:, even among one of the kinds of Idolatry, if an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar be kept standing. And indeed you follow a certain Antiquity, not of Catholicks, but of desperate Hereticks. <hi>Optatus,</hi> writing of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> says, That they did break, raze, and remove the Altars of God. <bibl>

                  <p>AT Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> first coming to the Crown, such <hi>English</hi> as had lived in exile amongst the <hi>Zwitzers,</hi> or at <hi>Geneva,</hi> became exceedingly enamored with <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Platform; by which they found so much Authority ascribed unto Ministers in their
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56964:150"/>
several Churches, as might make them absolute, and independent, without being called to an account by King, or Bishop. This Discipline they purposed to promote at their coming home. But the Queen had heard so much, from others, of their carriage at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractableness, in point of Decency, and comly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the Reign of her Brother, as might suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently forewarn her. Besides, She was not to be told, with what reproaches <hi>Calvin</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled her Sister; nor how she had been perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by his followers in the time of her Reign: Some of them railing at her Person, in their scandalous Pamphlets; Some practising by false and dangerous Allusions, to subvert her Government; and others openly praying to God, <hi>That he would either turn Her heart, or put an end to her days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of these Men she was to give her self no hope, but they would proceed with her, in the self same manner, whensoever any thing should be done, (how necessary, and just so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) which might cross their humours. The Consideration whereof was of such prevalency with those of her Council, (who were then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating about the altering of Religion) that they were resolved to have an eye upon those Men: Who were so hot in the persuit of their flattering hopes, that (out of a desire of Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as my Author tells me) they were busied, at that very time, in setting up a <hi>new form of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clestastical</hi>

                     <hi>Policy;</hi> and therefore were to be supprest with all care and diligence, before they grew to a head.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithstanding this discovery of their Rebellious practices; yet they had so many Friends in <hi>England,</hi> that they might easily have obtained Favour, in order to the Promoting their designs, had not <hi>Knox</hi>'s furious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moved him to write these following mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letters. In one of which, to Sir <hi>William Cecill,</hi> he first upbraids him with consenting to the suppressing of Christ's true Evangile, to the erecting of Idolatry, and the <hi rend="margQuotes">Shedding the Blood of God's most dear Children, during the Reign of mischievous <hi>Mary,</hi> the professed enemy of God, as he plainly calls her.</hi> Then he proceeds to justifie his Treasonable and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Book, against the <hi>Regiment of Women:</hi> of the truth whereof, he positively affirms, <hi rend="margQuotes">That he no more doubted than of the truth of that Voice of God, pronounced against that Sex; <hi>to wit,</hi> That in dolour they should bear their Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next he declared (in reference to the person of Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">That he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge her to be raised by God, for the manifestation of his Glory, although not nature only, but Gods own Ordinance, did oppugn such Regiments.</hi> And thereupon did inferr, <hi rend="margQuotes">That if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the Extraordinary Dispensations of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56964:151"/>

                  <p>SUch was the necessity, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> was under, that it was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possible to supply all the vacant places in it, but by admitting some of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Zealots to the Publick Ministry: the Realm had been extreamly visited in the foregoing year, with a dangerous and contagious Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which took away almost half of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; and occasioned such a Mortality amongst the rest of the Clergy, that a great part of the Parochial Churches were without Incumbents. The rest of the Bishops, Twelve Deans, and as many Archdeacons, Fifteen Masters of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> and <hi>Halls,</hi> Fifty Prebendaries of Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches, and about Fourscore Beneficed Men, were deprived at once, for refusing to submit to the Queens Supremacy. For the filling of which vacant places, it cannot be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56964:152"/>
imagined, but many past amongst the rest, who either had not hitherto discovered their dissatisfaction, or were connived at in regard of their Parts and Learning.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, there is no question to be made, but that some numbers of them were admitted unto Country-Cures, by means whereof they had as great an opportunity, as they could wish or desire, not only to Dispute their <hi>Genevian</hi> Doctrines, but likewise to prepare the People committed to them, for receiving such Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, both in Worship and Government, as were resolved, in time convenient, to be put upon them.</p>
                  <p>For a Preparative whereunto, they brought along with them the <hi>Genevian</hi> Bible, with their Notes upon it, together with <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms in English Meeter; that by the one they might effect an Innovation in points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and by the other, bring this Church more near to the Rules of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in some chief Acts of <hi>Publick Worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Notes upon the same Bible, in many places, savour of Sedition; and in some, of Faction, destructive of the Persons and Power of Kings, and of all Civil Intercourse, and Human Society.</p>
                  <p>There is a Note on 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8. 15, 16. where <hi>Asa</hi> is taxed by them, for not putting his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to death, but deposing her only from the <hi>Regency,</hi> which before She executed. Of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56964:153"/>
which Note, the <hi>Scottish Presbyterians</hi> made es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial use; not only in deposing <hi>Mary,</hi> their lawful Queen; but prosecuting her openly, and underhand, till they had taken away her life.</p>
                  <p>Now with this Bible, and these Notes, which proved so advantageous to them in their main projectments, they also brought in <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms in English Meeter; of which they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves to some Tune, in the time suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. For they came to be esteemed the most Divine part of God's <hi>Publick Worship;</hi> the <hi>Reading Psalms,</hi> together with the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Lessons,</hi> being heard in many places with a covered head; but all Men sitting <hi>Barehead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> when the <hi>Psalm</hi> is Sung. And, to that end the Parish-clark must be taught to call upon the people to Sing it, <hi>To the Praise and Glory of God;</hi> no such preparatory Exhortation being used at the naming of the Chapter, or the Daily Psalms. By these <hi>Preparatives</hi> they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in time, to bring in the whole Body of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> as well in reference to <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> as in Points of <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all this time, they could obtain no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from this State; though it was once endeavoured for them, by the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> whom they had gained to their Party; But it was only to make use of them for Politick Ends. Finding this opposition, they not only repined, and grudged at the Reformation,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56964:153"/>
which was made in this Church, because not fitted to their Fancies, and to <hi>Calvin's</hi> Platform; but have laboured to sow those Seeds of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodoxy,</hi> and <hi>Disobedience,</hi> which afterwards brought forth those Troubles, and Disorders, which ensued upon it. </p>

The Governors in each <hi>Island</hi> advanced the Plot, out of a covetous intent, to enrich themselves with the spoils of the Deaneries; the Brethren here, having by this means a hope to gain ground, by little and little, for the Erecting of the same in most parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And in pursuance of this project, both Islands joyn in a Confederacy to <hi>Petition</hi> the Queen for an Allowance of this Discipline, <hi>Anno</hi> 1563.

                  <p>In the mean time, the Queen, being strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded, that this design would much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Reformation in those Islands, was contented to give way unto it, in the Towns of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s-<hi>Port,</hi> and St. <hi>Hilaries</hi> only in <hi>Jersey;</hi> and in the Port of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Gernsey,</hi> but no further: Other parts of the Islands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Conform to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Now, although there be no express mention, in their Grant, of Allowing their Discipline, but only of their <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration</hi> of <hi>Sacraments;</hi> yet they presumed so far on the general words, as to put it presently in practice; intending to advance it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in all the rest of the Parishes, as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity should serve, and the condition of Affairs permit.</p>

                  <p>IN <hi>England</hi> they found not such success, as they did abroad; not a few of them being deprived of their Benefices, and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the Church, for their Inconformity. The news of which severity flies to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> occasioning <hi>Beza</hi> in the one, and <hi>Knox,</hi> and his Comrades, in the other, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose themselves in behalf of their Brethren. With what Authority <hi>Beza</hi> acted in it, we shall see anon. In <hi>Knox</hi> his Letter, sent from the General Assembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Church-Vestments are called <hi>Trifles</hi> and <hi>Rags</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With more Authority writes <hi>Beza,</hi> as the greater Patriarch; and he writes too concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of greater consequence than <hi>Caps</hi> and <hi>Surplices.</hi> For in a Letter of his to <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> he makes a sad complaint of <hi>suspending</hi> these Men, from the Ministry, for not <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing</hi> to some <hi>new Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:56964:155"/>
imposed upon them. But he seems more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That Women were suffered to Baptize in extream necessity. That Power was granted to the Queen, for Ordaining such other Rites, and Ceremonies, as should seem convenient; and that the Bishops had so much Authority.</hi> He excepts likewise against many other such things. The Copies of these Letters were presently dispersed, if not also Printed. Some of the Brethren, in their Zeal to the name of <hi>Calvin,</hi> preferred him once before St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> without doubt, would have taken it ill, if he had been esteem'd of less Authority, than any of the Successors of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So good a Foundation being laid, the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not chuse but go on apace. But first they must prepare the <hi>Matter,</hi> and remove all <hi>doubts,</hi> which otherwise might interrupt them in the course of their Building. And herein <hi>Beza</hi> is consulted, as the Master-workman. To him they send their several Scruples; and he returns such Answer to them, as did not only confirm them in their present obstinacy, but fitted, and prepared them for the following Schism.</p>
                  <p>To those mentioned before, they add <hi>the calling of Ministers,</hi> and their <hi>Ordaining by the Bishops,</hi> the <hi>Presbytery</hi> being not consulted: Which he condemns, as contrary to the Word of God; but so, that he conceives it better to have such a Ministry, than none at all: praying
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56964:155"/>
withal, that God would give this Church a more lawful Ministry.</p>
                  <p>In some Churches, and particularly in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Abbey,</hi> they still retained the use of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,</hi> made of Bread unleavened: This he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges for a thing indifferent. Unto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Questions, he gives Answer in this Letter; which is Superscribed, <hi>To certain of the Brethren of the Churches of</hi> England, <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Points of</hi> Ecclesiastical Order, <hi>and</hi> Government.</p>
                  <p>Upon the receiving this Letter, they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an open Schism, in the year next following. At which time, some (taking upon them to be of a more ardent Zeal, than others, in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the true Reformed Religion) resolved to allow of nothing in God's Publick Service, but what was found expresly in the Holy Scriptures. Their Number much encreased, on a double account. First by the negligence of some, and the connivance of other Bishops; and partly, by the secret favour of some <hi>Great Men</hi> in the Court, who greedily gaped after the remainder of the Churches patrimony.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but this Faction received much encouragement, underhand, from some Great Persons neer the <hi>Queen:</hi> from no Man more, than from the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> the Lord <hi>North, Knolls,</hi> and <hi>Walsingham;</hi> who knew, how mightily some Numbers of the <hi>Scots,</hi> both Lords and Gentlemen, had, in short time, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

                  <p>But what they durst not do directly, and in open sight, they found a way to act Obliquely, and under disguise of setting up another Church of <hi>Strangers</hi> in the midst of <hi>London.</hi> Many of the <hi>Low-country</hi> men had fled their Country, and setled their Dwellings in the Ports and Sea Towns of <hi>England;</hi> and good numbers of them, at <hi>London.</hi> For these there must be a Church in <hi>London.</hi> And for this purpose, a Suit is made by their Friends in Court, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.

This likewise gave the First Beginning to the now <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, Sandwich, Yarmouth, Norwich,</hi> and some other places in the North; to the great anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Presbyters, and to the discomfort of all such, who were of Judgment to fore-see the sad consequents of it.</p>

                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:56964:159"/>
With like felicity, they drove on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs in <hi>Jersey,</hi> and <hi>Gernsey,</hi> introducing their Discipline, by degrees, into all the Villages: Furthered therein by the Sacrilegious avarice of their several Governors, out of a hope to have the spoyl of the Deaneries, to engross all the Tythes to themselves, and then put off the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters with some sorry Stipends; as, in fine, they did.</p>
                  <p>It was also thought fit, That <hi>Snape,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> (the great Supporters of the Cause in <hi>England)</hi> should be sent unto them, to put their Churches in a posture and settle the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline amongst them in such Manner, and Form, as it was practised at <hi>Geneva.</hi>

                  <p>The like they did also in the English Church at <hi>Middleborough,</hi> the chief Town in <hi>Zealand;</hi> in which many English <hi>Merchants</hi> had their constant Residence.

                  <p>THe Queen was resolved to hold Her <hi>Prerogative Royal</hi> at the very height; and therefore would not hearken to such <hi>Propositions,</hi> as had been made in favour of the <hi>Puritan-</hi>faction, by their great Agents in the Court, though She had been many times sollicited in it.</p>
                  <p>She acquaints <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> that She determined to discharge her Self from the Trouble of all Church-Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and leave them wholly to his care. That She was sensible enough, into what Disorder, and Confusion, the Affairs of the Church were brought, by the connivance of some Bishops, the obstinacy of some Ministers, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of some great Lords, both in Court, and Country: But <hi>that</hi> notwithstanding, he must
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56964:161"/>
resolve, not only to assert the <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> but also to restore the <hi>Uniformity</hi> in God's Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, which by the weakness of his Predecessor, was so much endangered.</p>
                  <p>It is not easie to imagine what clamors were raised amongst the Brethren, upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how they moved Heaven and Earth, the Court and Country, and all the Friends they had of the Clergy, or Laity, to come to their assistance, in this time of their tryal. By means whereof, they raised so strong an opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his proceedings, that it put him to great difficulties. Some great Men about the Court, who had engaged themselves in the <hi>Puritan</hi> Quarrels, thought best to stand a while behind the Curtain, and set <hi>Beal</hi> upon him, of whose impetuosity, and edge against him, they were well assured. This <hi>Beal</hi> was in himself a most eager <hi>Puritan,</hi> trained up by <hi>Walsingham,</hi> to draw dry-foot after <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits;</hi> his extream hatred to those men being looked on, as the only good quality, which he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. But being over-blinded with zeal, he conceived, that whatsoever was not <hi>Puritan,</hi> must needs be <hi>Popish:</hi> And that the Bishops were to be esteemed no otherwise, than the Sons of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> because they were not looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>as Fathers,</hi> by the Brotherhood. And so far was he hurried on by these <hi>disaffections,</hi> that though he were raised to be one of the Clerks of the Council, yet he preferred the Interest of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:56964:162"/>
that Faction, before that of the Queens. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that he was noted to Jeer, and Gibe, at all such Sermons, as did most commend her Majesties Government, and move the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Obedience; not sparing to accuse the Preachers, to have broached <hi>false Doctrine.</hi> From this man the Archbishop received great affronts.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> upon some complaint made against the Liturgy, by some of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, required them to compose another, such as they thought might generally be accepted by them. The first <hi>Classis</hi> thereupon devised a new one, agreeable in most things, to the Form of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this <hi>draught</hi> being offered to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the second <hi>Classis,</hi> (for so the wise <hi>States-men</hi> had of purpose contrived the plot) there were no fewer than Six-hundred Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made against it; and consequently, so many Alterations to be made therein, before it was to be admitted. The Third <hi>Classis</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at those Alterations; and resolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on a new Model, which should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the other: And against this, the Fourth <hi>Classis</hi> was able to pretend as many Objections, as had been made against the first. So that no likelihood appearing of any other <hi>Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> either better or worse, to be agreed upon between them, he dismiss'd their Agents for the present; with this assurance, that whensoever
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56964:162"/>
they could agree upon any Liturgy, which might be universally received amongst them, they should find him very ready to serve them, in the setling of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walsingham</hi> tries his Fortune next, in hope to bring them to allow of the English Liturgy, on the removal of such things, as seemed most offensive: And thereupon he offered, in the Queens Name, that the Three Ceremonies, at which they seemed most to boggle; that is to say, <hi>Kneeling at the Communion, the Surplice,</hi> and <hi>the Cross in Baptism,</hi> should be expunged out of the Book of Common-Prayer, if that would content them. But thereunto it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That they would have a total Abolition of the Book, without retaining any part, or office in it, in their next New-nothing: Which peremptory Answer, did much alienate his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from them; as afterwards he affirmed to some, from whose Pen I have it.</p>
                  <p>The Brethren, on the other-side, finding how little they had gotten by their Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lords of the Council, began to steer another course, by practising upon the temper of the following Parliaments; into which they had procured many of their chief Friends to be received for Knights, or Burgesses, as they could prevail. By whose means, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Queen had commanded them, not to deal in any thing, which was of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Church) they procured a Bill
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56964:163"/>
to pass in the House of Commons, 1585, for making tryal of the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of such, as were to be <hi>ordained</hi> or <hi>admitted</hi> Ministers, by <hi>Twelve Lay-men;</hi> whose Approbation, and Allowance, they were first to pass, before they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Institution into any Benefice.</p>
                  <p>Another Bill was also passed, for making Marriage lawful at all times of the year, (which had been formerly attempted by the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</hi> They were in hand also with a Third, concerning Ecclesiastical Courts, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Visitations; pretending only a redress of some Exorbitancies, in excessive Fees; but aiming plainly at the overthrow of the <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like attempts were made in some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sessions;</hi> in which some Members shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves troublesome to sober men, alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the present Government, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respective towards the Queen. </p>

                  <p>THe chief Zealots of the Faction of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (finding, that they could not have their Wills on the young King <hi>James,</hi> [whose Mother was Prisoner in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land]</hi> and his Council) came into <hi>England;</hi> where they were much countenanced by Mr. Secretary <hi>Walsingham,</hi> who had set them at work, and therefore was obliged to gratifie them.</p>
                  <p>The Lords, and great Men of that Nation, were ordered to retire to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and many of the Ministers permitted to prepare for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Oxford, Cambridge,</hi> and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At <hi>London</hi> they are suffered, by some Zealous Brethren, to possess the Pulpits; in which they rail without controul, against their King, the Council, and their Natural Queen; labouring withal to beget, amongst the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, an ill opinion against the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to engage them for advancing that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56964:164"/>
of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> It would be too tedious to relate all that they acted in this kind.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of this Faction obtained such Assistance from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that they got the King into their hands, put a new Guard upon him, and conducted him whither they pleased. Upon this the English <hi>Puritans</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to have more of the <hi>Scot</hi> in them, than in former times. For presently, upon the News of the good Success, which their <hi>Scottish Brethren</hi> had, a scandalous Libel, in the nature of a Dialogue, is published and dispersed in most parts of <hi>England;</hi> in which the state of this Church is pretended to be laid open. They likewise had prepared their way to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then sitting, <hi>Anno</hi> 1586, by telling them, <hi rend="margQuotes">That if the Reformation they desired, were not granted, they should betray God, his Truth, and the whole Kingdom: That they should declare themselves to be an Assembly, wherein the Lord's cause could not be heard, wherein the infelicity of the miserable could not be respected, wherein Truth, Religion, and Piety, could bear no sway; an Assembly, that willingly called for the Judgment of God upon the whole Realm: And finally, That not a Man of their Seed should prosper, be a Parliament Man, or bear rule in <hi>England</hi> any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This necessary preparation being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, they tender to the Parliament, <hi>a Book</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:56964:164"/>
                     <hi>of the Form of Common-Prayer,</hi> by them desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; containing also, in effect, the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Discipline, so revised by <hi>Travers.</hi> And their Petition, in behalf of it, was in these words following; to wit, <q>May it therefore please your Majesty, That the Book hereunto annexed, and every thing therein contained, may be from henceforth used through all your Majesties Dominions.</q> But in this they were able to effect nothing.</p>
                  <p>It may seem strange, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should be so severe to her English <hi>Puritans,</hi> and yet protect and countenance the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in all other places. But that great Monster in Nature (called <hi>Reason of State)</hi> is brought to plead in her defence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leicester, Walsingham,</hi> and others, gave such encouragment, under-hand, to the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they resolved to proceed towards the putting of their Discipline in execution.

                  <p>It may be gathered from hence, what a hard game this Prelate had to play, when such great Masters in the Art, held the Cards against him.

                     <p>The several Churches, or Conventicles ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they had in the City, they reduced into one great, and general <hi>Classis,</hi> of which <hi>Cartwright, Egerton,</hi> or <hi>Travers,</hi> were for the most part Moderators; and whatsoever was there ordered, was esteemed for current: from thence the Brethren of other places did fetch their light, and as doubts did arise, thither they were sent to be resolved; the <hi>Classical,</hi> and <hi>Synodical</hi> decrees of other places, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authentical, till they were ratified in this; which they held the Supream Consistory, and chief Tribunal of the Nation.</p>

                     <p>At these <hi>Classes</hi> they enquired into the Life, and Doctrine of all, that had subscribed unto them, censuring some, and deposing others, as they saw occasion.</p>
                     <p>Unto every <hi>Classis</hi> there belonged a Register; who took the Heads of all that passed, and saw them carefully entred into a Book for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: that they might remain upon Record.</p>

                  <p>A Proclamation also was set forth, That whosoever had any Children beyond the Sea, should, by a certain day, call them home.</p>
                  <p>Commissioners were sent into all Parts and Divisions of the Realm, to enquire out Priests, and such as were reconciled by them; further charging all manner of Persons, to retain none in their Houses, without due examination of their conditions, manner of life, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Religion; and to keep thereof a Register, to be shewed to the said Commissioners, if they should demand it.</p>

                  <p>And likewise at the same instant, were taken Two Priests, in the Lady <hi>Browns</hi> House in <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> for saying Mass; with the Lady her self, and divers others, for hearing it: All which persons were <hi>Endicted, Convicted,</hi> and had the Law <hi>Executed,</hi> according to the Statute.</p>

The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> seeing this great Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity used against Catholicks, resolves to quit the Kingdom.

                        <salute>Madam,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Perceived in my late Troubles, how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly my Life was sought, and that my Innocency was not sufficient warrant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect me. I knew my self, (and besides was charged by your Council) to be of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they accounted odious, and dangerous to your Estate. Lastly, (but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally) I weighed, in what a miserable, and doubtful case, my Soul had been, if my Life had been taken away (as it was not not unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) by former troubles.</p>
                     <p>For I protest, the greatest burthen, that rested in my Conscience, was, because I had not lived according to the prescript rule of that, which I undoubtedly believe, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly presume to be the Truth.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, bing induced by all these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but chiefly moved by this last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thought, that the not performing my Duty to God, in such sort, as I knew would
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56964:169"/>
please him best, might be a principal occasion of my late punishment: and therefore resolved, whilst I had opportunity, to take that course, which might be sure to save my Soul from the danger of Shipwrack, although my Body were subject to peril of misfortune.</p>
                     <p>And ever since that time, I followed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued this good intent of mine, though I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed somewhat more danger to my Estate, yet I humbly thank God, I have found a great deal more quiet of mind: and in this respect I have just occasion to esteem my pass'd Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as my greatest felicity. For both of them were (though indirectly) the means to lead me into that course, which ever brings perfect quietness, and only procures Eternal happiness.</p>
                     <p>And being resolved, rather to endure my punishment, than willingly to decline from what I had begun, I bent my self wholly, as near as I could, to continue in the same, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any act, that was repugnant to my Faith and Profession; and by means hereof was compelled to do many things, which might procure peril to my self, and be an occasion of mislike to your Majesty.</p>
                     <p>For, the First day of Parliament, when your <hi>Majesty,</hi> with all your <hi>Nobility,</hi> was hearing of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> above in the Chancel, I was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to walk by my self below, in one of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56964:169"/>
Isles: and so upon several other occasions.</p>
                     <p>These things, with many others, I could by no means escape, but only by an open and plain discovery of my self, as the true cause of my refuse. Wherefore, since I saw, that of necessity it must shortly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and withal remembring, what a Watchful, and Jealous Eye, was carrid over all those, that were known to be <hi>Recusants;</hi> and withal, reflecting how all their Lodgings were continually searched, and to how great danger they were subject, if a <hi>Jesuite,</hi> or <hi>Priest,</hi> were found in their Houses, that either I could not serve God in such sort, as I had professed, or else I must incur the hazard of greater punishment.</p>
                     <p>I stood resolute, and unremovable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the first, though it were with danger of my Life: and therefore did apply my Mind to devise, what means I could find out, for avoiding the Last.</p>
                     <p>Long I was debating with my self, what course to take. But when I considered in what continual danger I did remain here in <hi>England,</hi> both by the heretofore Established, and by a New Act lately made, I thought it the safest way, to depart out of the Kingdom, and remain in some other place; where I might live without danger of my Conscience, without offence to your Majesty, without this servile subjection to my Enemies, and without this daily peril of my Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="334" facs="tcp:56964:170"/>
And yet I was drawn by such forcible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions to be of another opinion, that I could not easily resolve what to do.</p>
                     <p>For, on the <hi>one side,</hi> my Native Country, my Friends, my Wife, and Kindred, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite me to stay: on the <hi>other side,</hi> the power of mine Enemies, the remembrance of my former Troubles, and the knowledge of my present Danger, did hasten me to go. And in the end, I found no middle course; but either I must venture to live in extream Poverty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or to be sure to remain in continual Danger at home.</p>
                     <p>I regarded more the hazard of my Life, (wherein stood the peril of my Estate) and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sought the preservation of my Life, than the profit of my Living.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, after I had weighed as many dangers, as I could remember, and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that to depart the Realm was the safest way I could take, I resolved to take the benefit of a happy Wind, to avoid the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a bitter Storm. And knowing, that the Actions of Those, who go beyond Seas, though their intent be never so good, and dutiful, were yet evil thought of: I presume to write this Letter to your Majesty, and in it to declare the true causes and reasons of this my departure.</p>
                     <p>I here take God, and his Holy Angels, to witness, that I would not have taken this
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56964:170"/>
course, if I might have staied still in <hi>England,</hi> without danger of my Soul, and peril of my Life. And though the loss of Temporal Commodities be so grievous to Flesh and Blood, that I could not desire to live, if I were not comforted with the remembrance of his Mercy, for whom I endure all this (who endured ten thousand times more for me) yet I assure your Majesty, that your Displeasure would be more unpleasant to me, than the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of all my Losses, and greater grief, than the greatest of my Misfortunes.</p>

The main cause, for keeping the Episcopal Sees so long vacant, was, that in the mean time, the best Flowers might be culled out of them. Aid this year was sent to assist the Rebels in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> against their Lawful Queen. The <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> seeing Episcopal Government settled, begin to play their Game.</p>
                  <p>The Bishops, being thus settled, begin the next year, to make Laws, and to compose Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56964:171"/>
of Religion, and to exact a Conformity to them: upon which they find great oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Presbyterians.</p>
                  <p>In her Fourth year, she was solicited by Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> to send her Orators, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent;</hi> which she refused to do. The Emperor also writ to her to desist from these Alterations of Religion, and to return to the Ancient Catholick Faith of her Predecessors.</p>
                  <p>In her Fifth year, the Articles of Religion were agreed on in the Convocation.</p>
                  <p>In her Sixth year, she would have Married the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Scots. Calvin</hi> dies this year, and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the great promoter of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> retires out of <hi>England,</hi> upon a discontent, to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In her Seventh year, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> began first to be called <hi>Puritans.</hi>

                     <p>In her Eighth year, the Government of the Church, by Archbishops, and Bishops, was Confirmed. And for this we are beholding to <hi>Boner,</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>London:</hi> who being called up to take the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> by <hi>Horn</hi> of <hi>Winton,</hi> refused to take the Oath, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, because <hi>Horn</hi>'s Consecration was not good and valid by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>Which he insisted upon, because the <hi>Ordinal,</hi> Established in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56964:172"/>
Sixth, (by which both <hi>Horn,</hi> and all the rest of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Bishops, received Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration) had been Repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and not restored by any Act of Parliament, in the present Reign: (which being first declared, by Parliament in the Eighth of this Queen, to be <hi>Casus Omissus;</hi> or rather, that the <hi>Ordinal</hi> was looked upon as a part of the Liturgy, confirmed in the First year of this Queen:) They next Enacted, and Ordained, That all such Bishops, as were consecrated by it, in time to come, should be reputed to be lawfully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated.</p>

                     <p>In her Eleventh year, there arose a Sect, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemning the received Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> together with the Church-Liturgy; and the very Calling of Bishops.</p>
                     <p>This Sect so mightily encreased; that in the Sixteenth year of her Reign, the Queen, and Kingdom, was extreamly troubled with them.</p>
                     <p>In the same Sixteenth year, were taken at Mass, in their several Houses, the Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Lady, and her Children; the Lady <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Brown:</hi> who being thereof Endicted, and Convicted, suffered the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Laws.</p>
                     <p>In her Twentieth year, the severe Laws, against <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, were Enacted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:56964:172"/>
In her Twenty third year, a Proclamation was set forth, That whosoever had any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren beyond Sea, should by a certain day, call them home; and that no Person should har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any <hi>Seminary Priest,</hi> or <hi>Jesuit.</hi> At this time also there arose up in <hi>Holland</hi> a certain Sect, naming themselves, <hi>The Family of Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a Parliament held the 26th. year of her Reign, the <hi>Puritan party</hi> laboured to have Laws made, in order to the destroying of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the setting up of their own Sect.</p>
                     <p>In her Twenty eighth year, the Queen gave a special Charge to <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to settle an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Ecclesiastical Discipline, which lay now almost a gasping. And at this time, the Sect of <hi>Brownists</hi> (derived from one <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Brown)</hi> did much oppose the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In her One and Thirtieth year, the <hi>Puritan-Flames</hi> broke forth again.</p>
                     <p>In her Thirty sixth year, the Severity of the Laws were Executed upon <hi>Henry Barrow,</hi> and his Sectaries, for condemning the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as no Christian Church.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOw, for a close to this Work; I will add here in the first place, one thing, which I conceive deserves well to be taken notice of, which is this; to wit, That all the Doctrins, and Practices, which this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath deserted in these Changes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were delivered to us, by those Apostolical Men, that converted the <hi>Saxons,</hi> our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, to the Christian Faith; and this by the Confession of many Learned Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Which being so, it must necessarily be granted, that we have as much certainty of the Truth of those Doctrins, and Practices, as we have of any other Doctrins, or Practices,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56964:174"/>
in Christianity: Since they were all confirmed to us by the same Miracles, that first made us Christians. So that, if they be now found to be false, and erroneous, all the other Doctrins and Practices of Christianity must be so likewise; since the truth of them all depends upon the same Testimony: To wit, the Miracles that were then wrought, and the Authority of those Apostolical men, that delivered them to us.</p>
               <p>Now, for warrant of what I have here said concerning this, besides the Testimony of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Writings, Liturgy, Ritual, Missal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and besides the ancient Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, (especially of <hi>England,</hi> and the Synods anciently Assembled in this Nation,) I appeal to the Confession of the most Learned Protestants, as <hi>Humfr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Here you have had it clearly confessed by these Protestants, that these Doctrins and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, were delivered unto us by those, that first Converted our Predecessors, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> to the Christian Faith: And therefore be your self a Judge, whether these men do with Justice, and Reason, call the said Doctrins, and Practices, Superstitions: And withal, by this you may further perceive, how unjust all the Choppings and Changes in Religion have been, which have been related to you in this Book. And moreover, it will appear, That by these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings we have renounced our Right, and made our selves uncapable of defending the Truth of our Christianity: Since if those, who first brought us the News of it, and Converted
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56964:175"/>
us to it, brought such a Mass of Superstitions with it, (as <hi>Protestants</hi> are pleased to call them) then it is evident, we cannot be certain of the Truth of any Thing they taught us</p>
               <p>Thus we may see, how unjust we have been to our selves, in pretending these Reformations of Religion.</p>

For such men serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by kind Speeches, and Benedictions seduce the hearts of the simple.</q>

                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> here carefully warns them to take heed of Seditious sowers of Sects and dissention in Religion, and this ever to be the mark to know them by; to wit, If they teach, or move them to any thing, which was not agreeable to that, which they had learned at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version: Not bidding them to examine the case by the Scriptures, but by their First Form of Faith, and Religion, delivered to them before they had, or did read any Book of the new Testament.</p>
                  <p>Now his saying, That such Seducers <hi>serve their own belly,</hi> does evidently manifest, that howsoever Hereticks pretend in words, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal shew of their Sheeps-coat, to preach the Truth; yet indeed they seek but after their own profit, and pleasure: And by the Apostle's own Testimony here we are warranted so to judge of them, as of men, that indeed have no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Now to manifest how much such Hereticks, are to be detested, he writes thus to <hi>Titus, [Tit.</hi> 3. 10. 11.] <q>A man that is an Heretick, after the first, and second admonition, avoid: Knowing, that he that is such an one, is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</q>

                  <p>It is here to be noted, that not every one, who errs in Religion, is an Heretick; but he only, that after the Churches determination, wilfully, and stubbornly, stands in his false O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not yielding to the Decrees of Councils, or to the chief Pastors of the Church therein. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>y</hi> (saith St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> Epist. 162.) <q>that defend their Opinions (although they be false, and erroneous) with no stubborness, nor obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, especially if they be such, as themselves, did not broach by bold presumption, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them of their deceived Parents,</q> and do seek the Truth warily, and carefully, being <q>ready to be reformed, if they find it, such are not to be reputed Hereticks.</q> 
                     <hi>And again, [Lib.</hi> 18. <hi>De Civitat. Dei. Cap.</hi> 11.] <q>They, that in the Church of Christ hold any unsound, or erroneous Opinion, if being admonished to be of a right, and sound Opinion, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist obstinately, and will not amend their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous opinions, but persist in defence of them, are thereby become Hereticks; and going forth out of the Church, are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for Enemies that Exercise us; to wit, by Disputing against them.</q> Again, <hi>[Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>De Baptism. cont.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56964:176"/>
held.</q> And in divers places he declares, that St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> though he held an Error, yet was no Heretick, because he would not defend it, after a General Council had declared it to be Erroneous. <hi>[Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De Bapt. Cap.</hi> 4.] So <hi>Possidonius,</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Augustin [Vit. August. cap.</hi> 18.] reports, how after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the See Apostolick, to wit, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Opinion was Heretical, all men esteemed <hi>Pelagius</hi> an Heretick; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror made Laws against him, as against an Heretick. Again St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, <hi>[Lib. De Utilit. Credendi. cap.</hi> 1.] <q>He is an Heretick in my opinion, that for some Temporal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and specially for his Glory, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, coins, or else follows new Opinions.</q> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> likewise, notes in the latter end of his Book, <hi>De Haeresibus,</hi> That the People need not to be curious, to know what Opinions He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks hold; much less to labour to confute them: It being enough for them to know, that they are condemned. And St. <hi>Cyprian [Epist.</hi> 52. <hi>Num.</hi> 7.] sayes notably to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding curiously, what Heresies <hi>Novatian</hi> taught? <hi>No matter</hi> (saith he) <hi>what Heresies he holds, or preaches, when he teaches without:</hi> (That is to say, out of the Church.) Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Hereticks be often incorrigible, yet the Church of God ceases not by all means possible to revoke them. Therefore St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> says, <hi>[Epist.</hi> 162.] <hi>The Heretick himself, though</hi>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:56964:177"/>
                     <hi>swelling with odious and detestable pride, and mad with the frowardness of wicked Contention, as we admonish that he be avoided, lest he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such as are weak, and little ones, so we refuse not, by all means possible, to seek his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to understand the Reason, why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here says, That an Heretick is <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his own judgment;</hi> we are to know, That some other grievous offenders are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Excommunication from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, and the Fellowship of God's Church, by the Sentence of their Superiours in the same Church: But Hereticks, more miserable and unfortunate than they, run out of the Church of their own accord; and so give Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own Souls to damnation.</p>
                  <p>Now further to shew the Reason, why He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie (which seeks to divide, and tear in pieces the body of the Church) is so horrid a crime, St. <hi>Paul</hi> here describes its Unity, saying, [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12.] <q>For as the Body is one, and hath many Members; and all the Members of the Body, whereas they be many, yet are One Body; So also Christ. For in one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we were all baptized into one Body. And vers. 23. God hath tempered the Body, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it that wanted, the more abundant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that there might be no Schism in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but the Members together might be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one for another. And a little after, You
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56964:177"/>
are the Body of Christ, and Members of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to prevent the making a Schism in this Body, he says, [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 10.] <q>I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you All say one Thing, and that there be no Schisms among you; but that you be perfect in one Sense, and in one Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Again, <hi>[Eph.</hi> 4. 1.] I beseech you, that you walk worthy of the Vocation, in which you are called. And a little after, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. One Body, and One Spirit; as you are called in one Hope of your Vocation. One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism. One God and Father of All.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to manifest, what care our Saviour had taken to preserve this Unity of the Church; he further adds, <q>
                        <bibl>vers. 11.</bibl> And he gave some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and some Prophets, and other some Evangelists, and other-some Pastors, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to the Consummation of the Saints, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Work of Ministry, unto the Edifying (or building up) of the Body of Christ, <hi>(to wit, his Church;)</hi> until we meet all into the Unity of Faith, and Knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect Man, into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Age of the Fulness of Christ: That now we be not Children, wavering and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with every wind of Doctrin, in the wickedness of Men, in craftiness, to the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56964:178"/>
circumvention of Error. But doing the truth in charity, let us in all things grow in him, who is the Head, Christ: Of whom the whole Body <hi>(to wit, the Church)</hi> being compact, and knit together by all juncture of Submi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, according to the Operation in the measure of every Member, maketh the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Body unto the edifying of it self in charity.</q> Thus the Apostle fully delivers the admirable Structure of the Church.</p>

                  <p>Now as Rebellion is the bane of Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths and Kingdoms, and Peace and Concord the preservation of the same; so is Schism, Division, and diversity of Faith, the Calamity of the Church; and Peace, Unity, and Uniformity the special Blessing of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And in the Church, above all Common-wealths, Because it is in all points a Monarchy, tending every way to Unity: There being but One God, One Christ, One Church, One Hope, One Faith, One Baptism, One Head, One Body, as the Apostle here assures us.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56964:178"/>
of his Body, <hi>(to wit, the same Church, and of no other.) And a little after,</hi> vers. 25. Husbands (saith he) love your Wives, as Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself for it, that he might Sanctifie it, cleansing it by the laver of Water in the Word; that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it may be holy, and unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And again a little after, vers. 29. No man ever hated his own flesh, but he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth and cherisheth it; as also Christ the Church: Because we be the Members of his Body, of his Flesh and of his Bones.</q>

                  <p>The Apostle here saying, that Christ is <hi>the Saviour of his Body,</hi> (to wit, his Church) doth evidently declare, That none can be saved, or have any benefit by Christ, that is not of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Church: And what Church that is, St. <hi>Augustin</hi> expresseth in these words; <q>The Catholick Church only is the Body of Christ, whereof he is the Head. Out of this Body, of the Church, the Holy Ghost quickeneth no man. And a little after, He that will have the Spirit, let him beware he remain not out of the Church; Let him beware, he enter not into it feignedly. <bibl>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is an unspeakable Dignity of the Church;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56964:179"/>
which the Apostle expresseth often elsewhere, but more especially in this whole passage, to be that Creature for which Christ effectually Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to be washed and embrued with Water and Blood issuing out of his holy side, to be nourished with his own Body, to be his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to be so joyned unto him, as the Body and Members of the same Flesh, Bone and Substance to the Head, to be loved and cherished of him, as a Wife of a Husband; yea, to be his Wife and most dear Spouse, taken, and formed (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> often says) out of his own Side upon the Cross, as <hi>Eve,</hi> our First-Father <hi>Adam</hi>'s Spouse, was made of his Rib. <hi>August. in Psalm.</hi> 126, <hi>&amp;</hi> 127.</p>
                  <p>In respect of which great Dignity, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, the same holy Father affirms the Church to be the principal Creature of God; and therefore named in the Creed next after the Holy Ghost. And he proves, against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the Holy Ghost to be God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is named before the Church in the Confession of our Faith. Of which incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Excellency of the Church, so beloved of Christ, and so inseparably joyned in Marriage with him, if the Hereticks of our time, had any sense or consideration, they would neither think their contemptible Company, or Congregation, to be the glorious Spouse of our Lord; nor teach, that the Church may Err; that is to say, may be divorced from her Spouse for Idolatry,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56964:179"/>
Superstition, Heresie, or other Abominations. For this is as much as to say, That this his Wife, so dear, and so praised here, is in truth become a very Whore. By this it evidently appears, how just it is, that all <hi>Hereticks</hi> should be Excluded from all hope of Salvation; they being so injurious to Christ, in thus reviling the Church his Spouse, and accusing her of such horrid crimes.</p>
                  <p>It would require a large Volume to treat of all the passages of Scripture, which speak of this Sacred Authority of our Mother, the Church, and the certain Damnation incurred by all such as refuse to hear and obey her: to manifest which, I conceive, what has been here already said may suffice; as also to confute that horrid false Opinion generally held in this Nation, to the Destruction of many Souls; to wit, That all the multiplicity of Sects in this Nation, may yet be capable of Salvation, if they lead a Moral good Life: which how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true it is, these following Testimonies of the Fathers, conformable to the Testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, will make it evidently appear.</p>

                     <hi>Testimonies of the Fathers, shewing their Affection, and Zeal to Catholick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and their detestation of Schisms, and Divisions.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SAint <hi>Augustin</hi> says of the <hi>Donatists, [Epist.</hi> 48] <q>That they conceived it a thing indifferent unto what Party they joyned themselves, supposing, that they were Christians: and therefore, they remained fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Party, in which they were born.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now unto these St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and the rest of the Provincial Council at <hi>Cirta</hi> in <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>idia,</hi> sent this following Declaration. Aug. Epist. 152.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whosoever is separated from this Catholick Church, (amongst whom they reckoned the Sect of the <hi>Donatists)</hi> how laudably soever he may think himself to live, shall be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Eternal Life, and remain obnoxious to God's heavy Wrath, as being guilty of the heinous crime of being divided from the Unity of Christ,</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:56964:180"/>
And as for the Sacraments, received by them in that Separation, the Declaration goes on thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You being fixed in the Sacriledge of Schism, partake of the Sacraments of Christ to your own judgment, (or condemation:) Which Sacraments were profitable, and very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to you, when in Catholick peace you had Christ for your Head, where Charity co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a multitude of sins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says of them, <hi>[De Bapt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.] <q>Those whom the <hi>Donatists</hi> heal of the Wound of Idolatry, and Infidelity, they themselves wound more dangerously with the wound of Schism.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, <hi>[Super Gest. Emerit.]</hi> 
                  <q>Out of the Catholick Church an <hi>Heretick</hi> may have all things, but Salvation. He may have the Sacraments, He may sing <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> He may answer <hi>Amen,</hi> He may keep the Gospel, He may have the Faith, and Preach it: only Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he cannot have.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise in his Book against <hi>Petilian [lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.] he saith, <q>No Man preaching the Name of Christ, and carrying, or ministring the Sacraments of Christ, is to be followed against the Unity of Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, writing against the <hi>Adversary of the Law and the Prophets, [lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.] he hath these words, <q>If he hear not the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen, or Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56964:181"/>
which is more grievous than if he was strucken through with a Sword, consumed by Flames, exposed to wild Beasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, <hi>[August. de Symb. ad Catech. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.] <q>For this cause (says St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin)</hi> our Christian Creed concludes with the Articles touching the Church; because if any one be found separated from her, he shall be excluded out of the number of God's Children, neither shall he have God for his Father, who will not have his Church for his Mother. It will nothing profit such an one, that he hath been Orthodox, (or sound) in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, done so many Good Woorks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, In another place <hi>[Lib. de Past. cap.</hi> 12.] he saith, <q>The Devil saith not, Let them be <hi>Donatists,</hi> and not <hi>Arians;</hi> for whether they be here, or there, they belong to him, that grathers without making a difference. Let him adore Idols, saith the Devil, he is mine: Let him remain in the Superstition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he is mine: Let him quit Unity, and pass over to this, or that, or any Heresie, he is mine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So likewise the Ancient Father, St. <hi>Irenaeus, [lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 62.] <q>God (saith he) will judge those which make Schisms in the Church. Ambitious men, who have not the honor of God before their eyes; but rather embracing their own interest, than the Unity of the Church, for small and light causes, divide
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56964:181"/>
the great, and glorious Body of Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, St. <hi>Dionysius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, [Hist. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 45.] (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesseth) writing to <hi>Novatian,</hi> saith, <q>A Man ought rather to endure All Things, than to consent to the Division of the Church of God; since Martyrdom, to which Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves, to hinder the dismembring of the Church, is no less glorious, than what a Man suffers for refusing to sacrifice to Idols.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Also St. <hi>Cyprian [Lib. de Unitat. Ecles.]</hi> in his Book of <hi>the Unity of the Church:</hi> 
                  <q>Do they think (saith he) that Christ is amongst them when they are Assembled? I speak of those which make Assemblies out of the Church of Christ. No; although they were drawn to Torments, and Execution, for the Confession of the Name of Christ; yet this pollution is not washed away: No, not with their Blood. This inexplicable, and inexcusable crime of Schism is not purged away, even by death it self. That Man cannot be a Martyr, that is not in the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, (he saith) <q>He shall not have God for his Father, that would not have the Church for his Mother.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So likewise St. <hi>Pacianus,</hi> in one of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>[Epist.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Sempr.]</hi> 
                  <q>Although that <hi>Novatian</hi> (saith he) hath been put to death (for <hi>Christ)</hi> yet he has not received a Crown. And why? Because he was separated from the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:56964:182"/>
peace of the Church, from concord, from that Mother, of whom whosever will be a Martyr, must be a portion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> in one of his Homilies <hi>[Hom.</hi> 11. <hi>in Ephes.]</hi> tells us, <q>There is nothing doth so sharply provoke the wrath of God, as the Division of the Church: insomuch, as though we should have performed all other sorts of Good Things, yet we shall incur a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no less cruel, by dividing the Unity and Fulness of the Church, than those have done who pierced and divided Christ's own Body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Fourth Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> declares, <hi>[Can.</hi> 1.] <q>That out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church there is no Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> likewise saith, <hi>[De Remiss. Peccat. cap.</hi> 22.] <q>Out of this Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Title of Christian secures any one; neither doth Baptism confer Salvation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any man offer a Sacrifice agreeable to God; neither doth any man attain to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. For there is one only Church, one only Dove, one only Well-Beloved, one only Spouse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, (in his Book <hi>De Fide ad Petrum, cap.</hi> 39.) <q>Hold this (saith he) most firmly, and doubt not of it in any wise, That every <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Schismatick</hi> whatsoever, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, if before the end of his Life he be not Reunited to the Catholick
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56964:182"/>
Church, let him bestow never so many Alms, yea, though he should shed his Blood for the Name of Christ, he cannot obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise St. <hi>Prosper</hi> says, <hi>[Lib. de Prom. &amp; Praedestinat. Dei p.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.] <q>He who does not Communicate with the Universal Church, is an Heretick and Antichrist.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See</hi> Athanasius <hi>in the beginning of his</hi> Creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whosoever expects to be saved, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily (before all things) Assent to, and retain the Catholick Faith: which unless he preserves intire, and inviolate, <hi>(that is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely submits to it)</hi> without all question, he will perish everlastingly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, at the end thereof, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is the Catholick Faith: which except a Man believe Faithfully, he cannot be saved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> writing upon this <hi>Beatitude.</hi> 
                  <q>Blessed are those that suffer Persecution for Justice.</q> 
               </p>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>(Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sermone Domini in Monte.)</hi>
               </bibl>
               <p>
                  <q>It is not the suffering these Things (saith he) that makes men Blessed, but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going them (for the Name of Christ) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with an equal mind, but likewise with joy and much satisfaction. For many <hi>Hereticks,</hi> deceiving Souls under the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> have suffered many of these things: But they
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56964:183"/>
are therefore excluded from this reward of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Blessed,</hi> because it is not here only said, <hi>Blessed are those which suffer Persecution;</hi> but it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> further added, <hi>for Justice.</hi> Now, where <hi>Faith</hi> is not sound and entire, there can be no perfect <hi>Justice;</hi> since the <hi>Just man lives by Faith.</hi> Neither can <hi>Schismaticks</hi> promise to themselves any thing of this reward; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause likewise where there is no <hi>Charity,</hi> there can be no <hi>Justice.</hi> For the love of our Neighbor cannot design any thing that is evil, or unjust, against him. Hence it is manifest, that if they had such Charity, they would not seek to rent and tear in pieces the Body of Christ, which is his Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise the same Father, in his <hi>Fourteenth Sermon, De verbis Domini,</hi> proves in general against all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> That whatsoever in <hi>particular</hi> their opinions are, yet since <hi>they profess otherwise than the Church does,</hi> and requires of them to do, they are in <hi>a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> Estate; because thereby they <hi>virtually</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce one <hi>Fundamental</hi> Article of Faith: <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>the Authority and Unity of the Catholick Church:</hi> And therefore if they break <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> though but for <hi>one Doctrin,</hi> and that of it self of no <hi>great importance,</hi> their <hi>Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in all other Points will not avail them, wanting <hi>Truth;</hi> and especially renouncing <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Universal</hi> Church. Hereupon the same Father [in <hi>Psal.</hi> 54.] saith
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56964:183"/>
of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> 
                  <q>We have each of us one Baptism; in This they were with me. We celebrated the Feasts of the Martyrs; in This they were with me. We frequented the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of Easter; in This they were with me. But they were not in All Things with me. In Schism they were not with me. In Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie they were not with me. In many Things they were with me; and in some few Things they were not with me. But in those few Things in which they were not with me, those many Things do not profit them in which they were with me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So again the same <hi>Father,</hi> speaking to the same <hi>Donatists [Epist.</hi> 48.] saith, <q>You are with us in Baptism, in the Creed, and in other Sacraments of the Lord: But in the spirit of Unity, in the bond of Peace, and finally in the Catholick Church you are not with us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the same purpose writeth St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Book <hi>[De Unitate Ecclesiae]</hi> 
                  <q>One Church (saith he) the Holy Ghost, in the Person of our Lord; designeth, and saith, <hi>One is my Dove.</hi> This Unity of the Church he that holdeth not, doth he think that he holdeth the Faith? He that withstandeth and resisteth the Church; He that forsaketh <hi>Peters Chair,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Church was built, doth he trust that he is in the Church? When the Blessed Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> also sheweth this Sacrament of Unity, saying, <hi>One Body, and one Spirit,</hi>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:56964:184"/>
                     <hi>[Ephes.</hi> 4. 4.] Which Unity, we Bishops es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, that Rule in the Church, ought to hold fast and maintain; that we may prove the Bishoply Function also it self to be one, and undivided.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, in one of his Epistles, <hi>[Epist.</hi> 40.] <q>There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one Chair, by our Lord's Voice founded upon <hi>Peter.</hi> Another Altar to be set up, or a new Priesthood to be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides one Altar and one Priesthood, is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Whosoever gathereth elsewhere, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth. It is adulterous, it is impious, it is sacrilegious, whatsoever is instituted by mans Fury, to the breach of God's Divine Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Get ye far from the contagion of such men, and fly from their speeches as from a canker, and pestilence; Our Lord having premonished, and warned us beforehand, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are Blind leaders of the Blind. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 14.</q>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hilary</hi> likewise <hi>[Libro ad Constant. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.]</hi> thus applieth this same place of <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle [Ephes.</hi> 4. 4, 5.] against the <hi>Arians,</hi> as we may do against the <hi>Calvinists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Perillous, and miserable it is (saith he) that there are now so many Faiths as Wills, and so many Doctrins as manners; whiles either Faiths are so written as we will, or as we will, so are understood. And whereas according to one God, and one Lord, and one Baptism,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:56964:184"/>
there is also one Faith, we fall away from that which is the only Faith; and whiles more Faiths be made, they begin to come to that, that there is none at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark is an acknowledged Type of the Church, as it appears by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20, 21.] Wherefore, as All perished Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the Deluge, that were not in the Ark; so all perished Eternally, who are out of the Church: Witness St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whose words are these <hi>[Cyprian. lib de Unitat.

                  <p>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever separates himself from the Church, is separated from the Promises of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever forsakes the Church is an Alien, an Enemy, a prophane Person. He cannot have God for his Father, who will not have the Church for his Mother. Could any escape drowning, being out of the Ark? So neither shall any one escape Damnation out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>They cannot abide with God, who refuse to continue with one accord in his Church. Though they be cast into the Fire and burnt; though they be devoured by wild Beasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet shall not that be any Crown of their Faith, but a punishment of their perfidiousness. Such an one may be killed; he shall never be crowned. </p>

               <p>Now concerning the Supereminent Power of Bishops in the Church, as to the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Hereticks, and of the effect
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56964:185"/>
thereof, St. <hi>Jerom, [Epist. ad Heliodorum. cap.</hi> 7.] has these remarkable words: <q>God forbid (saith he) I should speak sinistrously of them, who succeeding the Apostles in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, make Christ's Body with their holy mouths, by whom we are made Christians; who having the Keys of Heaven, do after a sort, judge before the day of Judgment: who in sobriety and chastity, have the keeping of the Spouse of Christ, <hi>(to wit, his Church.) And a little after,</hi> They may deliver me up to Satan, to the destruction of my Flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus. And, in the old Law whosoever was disobedient to the Priests, was either cast out of the Camp, and so stoned of the People; or laying down his neck to the Sword, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated his offence by his Blood: But now the Disobedient is cut off with the spiritual Sword; or being cast out of the Church, is torn by the furious mouth of Devils.<bibl>
                        <hi>Thus St.</hi> Jerom.</bibl>
                  </q> 
               </p>
               <p>The Church's Practice in this, is taken from the Example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> [1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19.] where, having exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to preserve his Faith, and a good Conscience, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adds, <q>Which certain repelling, have made shipwrack about the Faith <hi>(that is, of their Faith;)</hi> of whom is <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:56964:185"/>
Now to prevent our being Seduced by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <q>And this know you, that in the last days shall approach perillous times: and Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, not obedient to their Parents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, wicked, without affection, without peace, accusers, incontinent, unmerciful, without benignity, traytors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of voluptuousness, more than of God; having an appearance indeed of Piety, but denying the vertue thereof: and these avoid. For these be they, that craftily enter into houses, and lead captive silly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, laden with sins, which are led with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers desires; always learning, and never attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the knowledge of the truth. But as <hi>Jannus</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> resisted <hi>Moses,</hi> so these also resist the Truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the Faith. But they shall prosper no further. For their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also was.</q> All these words St. <hi>Cyprian [Epist.</hi> 55. <hi>Num.</hi> 3.] Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds of such as by pride and disobedience resist God's Priests. <q>Let no faithful man (saith he) that keepeth in mind our Lords and the Apostles Admonition, marvel if he see, in the latter times, some proud and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born fellows, and the Enemies of God's Priests go out of the Church, or impugn the same: when both our Lord and the Apostle foretold us, that such should be.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:56964:186"/>
Now one Reason, why the going out of the Church by Heresie is so great a crime, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church is always preserved from Error, by the priviledge of Christ's Presence, of the Holy Ghosts Assistance, of our Lords Promise, and Prayer: of which see St. <hi>Augustin</hi> upon those words of the 118 <hi>Psalm.</hi> Conc. 13. <hi>Ne auferas de ore meo verbum veritatis usque quâque.</hi> Where he writes admirably of this matter.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose also these words of <hi>Lactantius</hi> are very remarkable. <q>It is the Catholick Church only that keeps the true Worship of God. This is the Fountain of Truth, This is the House of Faith, This is the Temple of God; into which if a Man enter not, or from which if any Man goes out, he is an Alien, and Stranger from the hope of everlasting life and salvation. No Man must by obstinate contention flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: for it stands upon Life, and Salvation.</q> St. <hi>Cyprian [Epist.</hi> 55. <hi>ad Cornel. Num.</hi> 3.] says, <q>The Church never departs from that which she once hath known;</q> And St. <hi>Irenaeus [lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.] <q>That the Apostles have laid up in the Church, as in a rich Treasury, all Truth.</q> It were an infinite labour to recite all that the Fathers say of this matter; All counting it a most pernicious absurdity to affirm, That the Church of Christ may err in Doctrins of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:56964:186"/>St. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18. says, <q>Little Children, it is the last hour, and as ye have heard that Antichrist comes, now there are become many Antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour. They went out from us; but they were not of us.</q> St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> upon this place writes thus; <hi>[Epist.</hi> 76. <hi>Num.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Magnum.]</hi> 
                  <q>The holy Apostle St. <hi>John</hi> did not put a difference betwixt one <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi> and another; nor meant any sort, that especially separated themselves, but generally called All, without exception, Antichrists, that were adversaries to the Church, or were gone out from the same.</q> And a little after, <q>It is evident, that All be here called Antichrists, that have severed themselves from the Charity and Unity of the Catholick Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, or Charge of the whole Church, from which Hereticks separate themselves; St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes thus <hi>[Lib. de Unitat. Ecclesiae.]</hi> 
                  <q>To <hi>Peter</hi> (saith he) our Lord after his Resurrection, said, <hi>Feed my Sheep;</hi> and built his Church upon him alone, and to him he gives the charge of Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sheep. For although, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, he gave his Power alike to all, saying, As my Father sent me, so I send you. Receive the Holy Ghost. If you remit to any their sins, they shall be remitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet to manifest Unity, he constituted one
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:56964:187"/>
Chair, and so disposed by his Authority, that Unity should have origin of one. The rest of the Apostles were that, which <hi>Peter</hi> was, in equal Fellowship of Honor, and Power; but the beginning comes of Unity; the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is given to <hi>Peter,</hi> that the Church of Christ may be shewed to be one, and one Chair.</q>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> also says thus, <hi>[Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Sacerdot.]</hi> 
                  <q>Why did our Lord shed his Blood? Truly, to redeem those Sheep, the Cure of which he committed both to <hi>Peter,</hi> and also to his <hi>Successors.</hi> And a little after, Christ would have <hi>Peter</hi> endowed with such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to be far above all his other Apostles. For he saith, <hi>Peter,</hi> Dost thou love me, more than all These do? Whereupon our Master might have inferred, If you love me, <hi>Peter,</hi> use much Fasting, Sleep on the hard Floor, Watch much, be a Patron to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, a Father to Orphans, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to Widows. But omitting all These things, he says, <hi>Feed my Sheep.</hi> For, all the other Vertues, certainly, may be done easily by many Subjects, not only Men, but also Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: but when it cometh to the Government of the Church, and committing the charge of many Souls, all Women-kind must needs give place to the burden and greatness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and a great number of Men also.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:56964:187"/>
St. <hi>Gregory</hi> likewise <hi>[Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 76] writes thus; <q>It is plain to all men, (saith he) that ever read the Gospel, that by our Lord's mouth, the charge of the whole Church was committed to <hi>St. Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apostles. For, unto him it was said, <hi>Feed my Sheep.</hi> For him was the Prayer made, that his Faith should not fail. To him were the Keys of Heaven given; and Authority to bind and loose. To him the Cure of the Church, and Principality was delivered: And yet he was not called the Universal Apostle. This Title indeed was offered, for the honor of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apostles, to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the holy Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon;</hi> but none of that See did ever use it, or consent to take it.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus St.</hi> Gregory.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul [ad Corinth.</hi> 1. 2. 15.] says, <hi>The Spiritual man judgeth all things.</hi>

                  <p>This name <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be common to all the Faithful; and other new Names of Schismaticks and Sectaries, must be abhorred. <q>If you hear <hi>(Saith St.</hi> Hierom, <hi>contr.

any other (to wit, such Sects) be named, they cease to be Christians; Who having left the Name of Christ, have assumed the Names of Men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can our now Sectaries help, or excuse themselves, by objecting, That we are called <hi>Papists:</hi> For, besides that it is by them scornfully invented (as the name <hi>Homousians</hi> was by the <hi>Arians)</hi> This Name is not of any one Man, Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere, known to be the Author of any Schism, or Sect (as their callings be) but it is of a whole State, and order of Governors, and that of the chief Governors; to whom we are bound to cleave in Religion, and to obey in all things concerning it. So that to be a <hi>Papist</hi> is to be a Christian, a Child of the Church, and a Subject of Christ's Vicar. And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such impudent Sectaries as compare the Faithful, for following the Pope, to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Hereticks, bearing the names of new Masters, let us ever have in readiness this saying of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> writing to Pope <hi>Damasus [Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erom. Epist. ad Damasum] Vitalis I know not, Miletius I refuse, I know not Paulinus. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gathereth not with you, scattereth. That is to say, Whosoever is not Christs, is Antichrists.</hi> And again, <hi>If any man joyns with</hi> Peter's <hi>Chair, he is mine;</hi> that is, he is of one Faith with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:56964:189"/>
It is here further to be observed, That this name <hi>Christian</hi> (given to all Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the whole Church) was especially taken, to distinguish them from Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, which believed not at all in Christ: And the same now likewise severeth, and makes Christians known from Turks, and others, who believe nothing of the Divinity of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But when Hereticks began to rise up among Christians, (which Hereticks professed Christs Name, and sundry Articles of Faith, as true Believers do) then the name of <hi>Christian</hi> was too common to distinguish such Hereticks, and make them known from true Believers, who were entirely sound in their Faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to distinguish these, from such true and faithful Believers of All Doctrines of Christian Faith, the Apostles (inspired by the Holy Ghost) put into the Creed the name <hi>Catholick;</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>A true and faithful Believer of all Christian Doctrin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by this it appears evidently, That no Heretick is a <hi>Catholick,</hi> although they falsely pretend to it, when they are pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ssed with this Article of the Creed.</p>
                  <p>To confirm what hath been here said, St. <hi>Pacianus [Epist. ad Sympherianum.]</hi> writes thus: <q>When Heresies were risen, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by divers Names to tear the Dove of God, and Queen (to wit, the Church) and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56964:189"/>
to rent her in pieces; the Apostolical People reqired their Sir-name, whereby the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</q> People might be distinguished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so those that before were called <hi>Christians,</hi> are now <hi>Sirnamed Catholicks. Christian is my Name</hi> (saith he) <hi>Catholick my Sirname.</hi> And thus the word <hi>Catholick</hi> is a proper note, by which the Apostles, in their Creed, taught us to discern the true Church from the false Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Congregations of all sorts of Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>And not only the meaning of the word, which signifies <hi>Universality</hi> of <hi>Times, Places,</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> but likewise the very name, and word it self, by God's Providence, has been <hi>always,</hi> and <hi>only,</hi> appropriated to True Believers: And though sometimes, at the beginning, or first rising up of Sects, challenged by them, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtained by Hereticks, as their constant Name.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore St. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayes, <q>In the lap of the Church, the very name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick keeps me, <hi>[Aug. contr. Epist. Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament. cap.</hi> 4.] And again, <hi>[Tract.</hi> 32. in <hi>Joan.]</hi> We receive the Holy Ghost, if we love the Church, if we be joyned together by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we rejoyce in the Catholick Name and Faith.</q>
                  </p>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>John</hi> 6. 55.</bibl> My Flesh is meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed. </q>Where he writes
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56964:190"/>
thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p> The following words are these, as my Living Father sent me, and I live by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so he, that eats (or feeds upon) me, shall live by me. Our Saviour has taught us by these Misterious Words, That we are to be as Members in his Body, the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, or connected to him, as our Head, feeding upon his Flesh, and not deserting his Unity.</p>
                  <p>Now that, which makes us his Members, is this Unity: Which Unity is caused by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, diffused into our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us. It is therefore the Spirit (to wit, of Charity) that gives life, making us living Members. Nor does this Spirit make any living Members, but such as are in the Body of the Church; which receives life from the same Spirit. For the Spirit, or Soul which is in man, does not give life to a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber separated from the Body; because it is not joyned by Union to the same Body.</p>
                  <p>The design of this Discourse, is to move us to love Unity, and fear a separation from the Church. For a Christian ought to fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than to be separated from the Body of Christ, to wit, his Church: Since such as are separated from this his Mystical Body, are not his Members; and not being his Members, they cannot receive life from his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:56964:191"/>
Now the Apostle assures us, That such as have not the Spirit of Christ, belong not to him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And a little after, in the same <hi>Homily,</hi> he goes on thus: </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Faithful know Christ's Body, if they neglect not to be his Body. They must be his Body, if they will live of the Spirit of Christ. For none live of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, but his Body, the Church. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well, what I have said.</p>
                  <p>You, being a Man, are composed of a body and a spirit; which is otherwise termed a Soul. The Spirit, or Soul, is invisible, the Body, visible. Now as your Body lives by your Spirit; so if you will live by the Spirit of Christ, you must be in the Body of Christ. For as my Body lives by my Spirit, and your Body, by yours; so the Body of Christ cannot live, but by the Spirit of Christ.</p>
                  <p>He that desires to live, may understand here where he is to live, and from whence he is to receive his life. He must approach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and be incorporated, if he pretends to live. He must not voluntarily separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from being connected with the Members of this Body of the Church; nor be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Member, so as to deserve to be cut off: Nor yet so deformed, or out of order, that the rest of the Members of the Body may be ashamed of him. He is therefore to be fair, and neat, aptly proportioned to the rest, and in perfect health.</p>

                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:56964:191"/>
Moreover he must be careful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here closely to the Body of the Church, taking his life from God, and referring it to him, labouring here in this life, that he may afterwards reign in Heaven.</p>

               <p>NOw yet, to penetrate more fully into the true Grounds, why, above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all other Sins a Christian is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of committing Schism, that is, the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of an Altar against an Altar; or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing the External Communion of the Church, the making Collects or Assemblies without, yea against the consent of the true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or Church Governors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be a sin so unpardonable, we are to consider, that the true reason of this may be deduced from the Example of all other Governments whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

For, the greatest offence a Subject can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit against Monarchy, is an actual attempt, or rather the attempt executed, by which Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is dissolved. Inwardly to condemn the Laws of such a Government; or to entertain Principles, which if put in practice, would withdraw Subjects from their due Obedience, is an offence of an high nature; but the actual Cantonizing of a Kingdom, and the raising in it Courts and Judicatories, independent on, and opposite to the Common Tribunal of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is the utmost of all crimes: both the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers and the Seduced, are not only deprived of the Privileges belonging to good Subjects, but pursued by Arms, as the worst of All E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p>It is so in God's Church. The main Thing our Creed teaches us to believe of it, is its U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without which it is not a Church. Now if Unity, then Order, then Subordination of Governments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What therefore is the great Sin against this Fundamental Constitution of the Church, but Schism? A dissolving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and connexion, that the Members of this great Body have amongst themselves, and with relation to the whole?</p>
               <p>We all willingly acknowledge, that the great sin of the Synagogue, the sin that filled up the measure of the crimes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was their Murdering of our Lord. Now, says St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But may not Ignorance excuse the Guilt of Schism? No: On the contrary, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, it aggravates it.</p>
               <p>For, though Pride, and Malice, be far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the leading Schismaticks, Persons of Wit and Learning; yet ignorant Souls, and Ideots, seem more to contradict Human reason; because the more ignorant they are, and being no Pastors, the more they ought to submit their judgments to Authority; and consequently the preferring their own conduct, or the conduct and direction of particular men, or Churches, before the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Authority of the Church, the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, as it were, the whole Church of God, the esteeming all Christians, both Pastors and Flocks, as Heathens and Publicans, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption so contrary to human nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that their want of Learning is that which will most of all condemn them.</p>
               <p>I speak not now of Persons absolutely Ideots, who scarce know there are any other Pastors, or any other Church than their own; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not at all to pass their judgments on other Religions; but know only what their Pastors teach them; having not ability, by reason of their condition, to examine Scriptures, and Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:56964:193"/>
For such, no doubt, may, by their simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and absolute invincible ignorance, escape the malignity of Schism.</p>
               <p>But I speak of Inferior Tradsmen, of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Gentlewomen, who have a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being rightly instructed, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, of the Spiritual Authority, to which they owe their Subjection; and yet who, by their own perversness, become troublers of the Church; and who, because they can read the Scriptures, take upon them to judge of the Sense of them, both for themselves, and their Pastors.</p>
               <p>Such as these, no doubt, have drunk in the very Gall of Schism, by usurping an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which express Scripture says, belongs only to Pastors.</p>
               <p>I fear, much fewer than is ordinarily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined of those, who have any liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be excused from this sin, by any Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Surreptition, Provocation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reason of that great evidence and light, which they have of the continued Succession, Unity of Doctrin, perfect Obedience to their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Superiors, Pennances, and Retirements from the World; and several other signal marks of the One, Holy, Catholick, and Apostclick Church.</p>
               <p>Some may be more deeply guilty, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a heavier damnation, than others; as Ring-leaders, more than their Followers:

               </argument>
               <p>NOw, whereas some Protestants seek to vindicate the Church of <hi>England</hi> from Schism, by likening it to the Church of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>That it condemned no man, nor separated none from its Communion;</hi> yet you are to know, that this Plea helps them not at all.</p>
               <p>For, although this Moderation did exempt St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> from Schism, because (as <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> says) <hi>The Church had not then decided the dispute;</hi> to whose decision <hi>St. Cyprian would certainly have submitted:</hi> Yet this Moderation does not at all exempt the Church of <hi>England</hi> from Schism; because her separation from her Mother-Church is for very many Doctrins of Faith, defined, and determined by the same Church.</p>
               <p>This following Example, will make the Case of the Church of <hi>England</hi> evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:56964:194"/>
For if (for Example) a Province in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had with-drawn it self from the Publick Civil Authority, this Excuse would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from being Rebels, to say, <hi rend="margQuotes">We do not intend to quarrel with Those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Obedience to the King; we mean neither him, nor them, any harm, They shall be welcome to come among us; if they will, we will be good friends; we will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with their doings, but we will be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by our own Laws, and Magistrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> I believe, (I say) This would not take from them the Guilt of Rebellion. Their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, in such their Rebellion, would not change the Title of their crime, nor free them from the punishment due unto it. It may perhaps, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Prince's resentment; but the civilest Treason is Treason.</p>
               <p>In this Point of Schism, to the end that Doctor <hi>Peirce,</hi> in his Court-Sermon, may clear Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and lay the weight of so great a crime, on the Catholick Church; he argues thus: <q>Since besides the corruptions in Practice, (which yet alone cannot justifie separation) there were in the Roman Church so many corruptions in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin likewise, entrenching on Fundamentals, the Schism could not be on the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s side; which was obliged to separate, so just cause being given; but on theirs, who gave the cause of the separation.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:56964:194"/>
This Plea of the Doctors, if it be admitted, totally destroys all Governments, and lays all the Guilt of Schisms, and Rebellions in Church and State, upon Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Governors.</p>
               <p>For, if Subjects may accuse their Governors, and be themselves Judges of the Justice of such their Accusations, the Governors are always sure to be condemned and pronounced guilty, and the Subject justified.</p>
               <p>Now, to admit this Liberty of the Subject in Church-Government, above all others is the most unjust Thing imaginable; because that Government is protected from all error in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins of Faith, by the assistance of the Holy Ghost; who was sent by our Saviour <hi>to teach it all Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, to tax that Government with Errors in Faith, is, either to tax the Holy Ghost with them, or to blaspheme against our Saviour, by saying he has not kept his word, in <hi>sending the Holy Ghost to teach</hi> the Church <hi>All truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, There is this other consideration, which doth further manifest the weakness of this the Doctor's Plea.</p>
               <p>For, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be our Mother-Church, (as King <hi>James</hi> acknowledged her to be, in a publick Speech made to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he says, <hi>I acknowledge the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be our Mother-Church: [See Stow,</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:56964:195"/>
pag. 840.) then it will follow, (as it was urg'd in Parliament by Doctor <hi>Heath,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth),</hi> 
                  <q>That if now, after so many Ages, this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be found an Erroneous Church, then we have hitherto received no benefit by our Christianity; but rather have been all along deceived: Since if this Mother-Church be false, the Doctrin which she taught us, must necessarily be false:</q>  A Church being said to be false, because she teacheth false Doctrin.</p>
               <p>Thus the Doctor may see, what he has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his Reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is one thing yet, that deserves well to be taken notice of, in this change of Religion here in England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, if all the Clergy, and the Universities, had generally assented to this Change, it might have seemed a lesser crime. But to have this done, (as <hi>de facto</hi> it was done in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Reign) by Laymen only, and this only with the Difference of Six Voices in Parliament (although that Parliament was pack'd for this purpose) and in opposition to the contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, and Declarations of all the Clergy, and Universities, This does heighten this crime to the utmost of all Impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:56964:195"/>
                  <hi>I will yet for a close, add one thing more: which does not a little manifest this Impiety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For although Reformation of Religion was here pretended; yet it evidently appears by our English History, that nothing but worldly and carnal Interests carried on this business. For was not the Liberty, obtained by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, to bring into his Bed a new hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Wife, instead of his former vertuous Queen, a very carnal Interest?</p>
               <p>Was not his invading all the Possessions, and Treasure of Monasteries, a great Secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest?</p>
               <p>Was not the dividing the said Lands amongst the Nobility, and Gentry, at very easie rates, a very great Interest?</p>
               <p>In King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, was not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's seizing on the remainder of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoyls, a great Interest?</p>
               <p>Was not the freeing of Clergy-men from a necessity of saying, daily, and almost hourly, long Ecclesiastical Offices, from lying alone without Bedfellows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> matters of great, both carnal and secular Interest?</p>
               <p>Was not the exempting of All, both Layity and Ecclesiasticks, from the Duty of confessing their Sins, and submitting themselves to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Satisfactions, from rigorous Fasts out of Conscience and Religion, and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities, a matter of considerable Interest to Flesh, and corrupt Nature?</p>

By what hath been hitherto said, appears but even too clearly, how that the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rule of all Government and Subordination, was utterly neglected in <hi>England,</hi> at the time that the pretended Reformation was contrived, and executed.</p>
               <p>Here is a new, and thorough moulding of a Church, both in Doctrins, and Discipline, called a Reformation: Wherein all the Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acts of this Church, since Christianity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred among us, are, as to any obliging Power, by their Authority reversed; wherein all the Decisions of Patriarchal Councils, yea, of Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Synods, are called into Examination: All their Laws, (so far as to them seemed meet) reformed; the whole regard, that <hi>England</hi> had to all other Catholick Churches, as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the whole, is utterly broken by one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church.</p>
               <p>Nay, not so much: By one Luxurious King; By one Child, and by one Woman: Even when the whole Body of the Clergy protested against it. Let the world now be judge, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Action can be justified.</p>

But yet this they have done; as will appear by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Testimonies of some very Eminent amongst them.</p>

                  <hi>See Sir</hi> Edwyn Sands <hi>in his</hi> Europae Speculum, Numb. 12. <hi>where he has this following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Security in submitting to the Authority of the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>Which although he delivers in the Person of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. yet it is without Reply, or seeking to deny the Truth of any thing here said. The Discourse then is this.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>SInce Christianity is a Doctrin of Faith, a Doctrin whereof all Men are capable, as being in gross, and in general to be believed by all; and since the high Vertue of Faith is in the Humility of the Understanding; and the Merit thereof in the readiness of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Embrace it: and withal, since of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proofs of our Faith (where the true sense of Scripture is disputed) the Churches Testimony, whether for declaring to us the sense of Scripture, or the judgments of the Ancients, is a proof of most weight: What madness were it for any man, to tire out his Soul, and to wast away his Spirits, in tracing out all the thorny paths of the Controversies of these days! wherein to err is no less easie, than dangerous, what through forgery of Authors abusing him; what through sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry beguiling him; what through passion and prejudice transporting him: and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betake himself to the right path of Truth; whereunto God, Nature, Reason, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience do all give witness: And that is,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56964:197"/>
to associate himself to the Church, whereunto the custody of this Heavenly and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truth hath been, from Heaven it self, committed. To weigh discreetly which is the true Church; and that being once found, to receive faithfully, and obediently, without doubt, or discussion, whatsoever it delivers.</p>
                  <p>Now to discover this, let him reflect, that, besides the Roman Church, and such others, as are United with it, he finds all other Churches to have had their end, or decay, long since; or their beginning but of late. This Church was founded by the Prince of the Apostles, with a promise to him from Christ, <hi>That Hell Gates should never prevail against it,</hi> Matt. 16. 18. And that himself would be assistant to it, <hi>to the Consummation of the World.</hi> It hath now continued <hi>Sixteen hundred years,</hi> with an Honorable and certain Line of near Two hundred and forty Popes, Successors of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> both Tyrants, Traytors, Pagans, and Hereticks in vain wresting, raging, and undermining it.</p>
                  <p>All the Lawful general Councils, that ever were in the World, have, from time to time, approved and honored it: God hath so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously blessed it from above, that many Learned and wise Doctors have enriched it with their Writings, Armies of Saints with their Holiness and Virtues; Armies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs with their Blood; and of Virgins with
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56964:198"/>
their Purity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have sanctified and embellished it. And even at this day, in such difficulties of unjust Rebellions, and unnatural Revolts of her nearest Children; yet she stretcheth out her arms to the utmost corners of the World, newly embracing whole Nations into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in all other opposite Churches there are found inward dissensions, and contrarieties, change of opinions, uncertainty of resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with robbing of Churches, rebelling against Governors, confusion of Order: Whereas, contrariwise in this Church, there is the Unity undivided, the resolutions unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the most heavenly Order, reaching from the hight of all Power, to the lowest of all Subjection; all with admirable Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and undefective correspondence bending the same way, to the effecting of the same work: all which do promise no other, than a continual encrease and victory.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, let no Man doubt to submit himself to this glorious Spouse of Christ.</p>
                  <p>This then being accorded to be the true Church of God, it follows, that she be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently obeyed in all things, without further inquisition; she having the warrant, that he that hears her, hears Christ; and whosoever hears her not, hath no better place with God, than a Publican or Pagan. And what folly were it, to receive Scriptures upon the credit
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:56964:198"/>
of her Authority, and not to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them, upon her Authority also, and credit?</p>
                  <p>And if God should not always protect his Church from Error, and yet peremptorily command Men always to obey her, then had he made very slender provision for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind: which conceit concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God (whose care of us, even in all things touching this transitory Life, is so plain and evident) would render us very ungratefully impious.</p>
                  <p>And hard were the case, and mean had his regard been, of the vulgar People; (whose wants, and difficulties in this life, and whose capacities will not suffice to sound the deep and hidden Mysteries of Divinity, and to search the truth of intricate Controversies); if there were not others, whose Authority they might safely follow and rely upon, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they who believe, and have not seen,</hi> Joh. 20. 29.

                  <p>These following Considerations (says he) may very easily perswade persons of much
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:56964:199"/>
reason, and more Piety, to maintain that, which they know to have been the Religion of their Fore-fathers; which had actual pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and seizure of Mens minds, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, before the <hi>opposite Professions</hi> had a name. As first, its Doctrin having had a long continuance, and possession of the Church: Which therefore cannot easily be supposed, in the present professors, to be a design; since they have received it from so many Ages. And it is not likely, that all Ages should have the same purposes; or that the same Doctrin should serve the several ends of divers Ages.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, its long prescription; which is such an advantage, that it cannot, with many Arguments be retrenched; as relying upon these grounds: to wit, that Truth is more Ancient than Falshood; and that God would not, for so many Ages, forsake his Church, and leave her in an Error.</p>
                  <p>Again, the beauty and splendor of that Church, their Solemn Service, the stateliness and magnificence of their Hierarchy, their name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> which they claim as their own due, and to concern no other Sect of Christianity. The Antiquity of their Doctrin; the continual Succession of their Bishops, their immediate derivation from the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Their Title to Succed St. <hi>Peter;</hi> whose Personal Prerogatives were so great. The
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56964:199"/>
Honorable Expressions concerning this Church, from many eminent Bishops of other inferior Sees: which being old Records, have obtain'd a credibility.</p>
                  <p>The multitude, and variety of People, which are of their Perswasion: Apparent consent with elder Ages, in matters Doctrinal: The Advantage, which is derived to them by retaining the Doctrin of the Church of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times: The great consent one part with another, in that which they affirm to be <hi>de Fide:</hi> The great differences which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced amongst their Adversaries, abusing the liberty of Prophesying unto a very great Licentiousness.</p>
                  <p>Their happiness in being instrumental in converting divers Nations. The advantage of Monarchical Government; and the benefit which they daily enjoy by it.

               <p>See the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> declaring the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Uniting Christians into one Body, but by their adhering to the Roman See.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>What is the reason (saith <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his First Reply to <hi>Rivet. ad Artic.</hi> 7.) That such as differ in Opinion amongst Catholicks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the same Body, not breaking Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: But on the contrary, when dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions happen amongst Protestants, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thus compose Disputes, and oppositions, although they speak much of Fraternal Love? Now he, that shall examine this well, will find how much force and power there is in the Primacy.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This brings to mind that saying of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Primacy. <q>Wherefore, amongst the Twelve One was chosen, that a Head being constituted, and appointed, all occasion of <hi>Schism</hi> might be taken away. <bibl>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now again, the same <hi>Grotius,</hi> in the close of his last Reply to <hi>Rivet,</hi> written not long before his death; writes thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:56964:200"/>
It is well known, that <hi>Grotius</hi> has always wished for a Restitution, and Reuniting of Christians into one and the same Body. He was sometime of Opinion, that this might have been begun by a Conjunction, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Protestants amongst themselves. But he afterwards discerned, that this was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be effected; because, besides that, most of all the <hi>Calvinists</hi> are totally averse from any such Peace, or Union; Protestants are not associated, or united, under any Common Ecclesiastical Government; which is the cause, why the diverse parts of them cannot be collected into one Body. And withal, this is the Reason, that they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily still divide into more new Sects, or Parts.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Grotius</hi> now plainly sees, and judges, as likewise many others with him, that Protestants can never be united amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, unless they be joyned with those, that adhere to the Roman See; whithout which no common Government can be expected in the Church.</p>
                  <p>And therefore he wishes, that the Division and Separation which has been made, and likewise the causes of it, may be taken away. Now amongst these the Primacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> according to the Canons, cannot be looked upon as one cause, even by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of <hi>Melancthon</hi> himself; who thinks
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56964:201"/>
that Premacy to be necessary for the retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preserving of Unity.</p>
               </q>
               <p> Thus <hi>Grotius,</hi> concering the Uniting all Christans by their adhering to the Roman See.</p>

                  <q>Seeing (saith he) the Controversies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in our times, are grown in number so many, and in matters so intricate, that few have time and leisure, fewer strength of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, to examine them: what remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for men desirous of satisfaction in Things of such consequence, but diligently to search out, which, amongst all the Societies of the World, is that <hi>Blessed company of Holy Ones,</hi> that <hi>Houshold of Faith,</hi> that <hi>Spouse of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Church of the Living</hi> God, which <hi>is the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>Ground of Truth,</hi> that so he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her Communion, follow her Directions, and rest in her Judgment.</q>

                  <hi>Thus Dr.</hi> Field.</p>
               <p>In like manner, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Treatise of Heresie, <hi>[Sect. 13. Num. 2, 3.]</hi> speaks thus of the Christians Security (from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence) in his adherance <hi>in matters of Faith</hi> to Church Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If we consider (saith he) God's great, wise, and constant Providence, and care over his
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56964:201"/>
Church, his desire that All Men should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in order to that, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all necessary Truth; his Promise, That he will not suffer his Faithful Servants to be tempted above what they are able; nor permit scandals, and false Teachers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to the seducing of the very Elect, his most Pious, Godly Servants: If (I say) we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der These, and some other such-like general Promises of Scripture, wherein this question [about the <hi>Errability of Councils]</hi> seems to be concerned, we shall have reason to believe, that God will never suffer All Christians to fall into such a Temptation, as it must be, in case the <hi>whole Representative of the Church</hi> should err in matters of Faith; and therein find ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and reception amongst all Those Bishops, and Doctors of the Church diffused, which were out of the Council.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus he,</hi>

               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>According to this it is, <hi>(saith he)</hi> that Christ is said, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12. to have given not only <hi>Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> but also Pastors, and Teachers; that is, Bishops in the Church, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacting the Saints into a Church, for the building up of the Body of Christ, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and continuing them in all Truth; that we should be no more like Children, carried about with every wind of Dectrin.</p>

And so again, when Heresies came into the Church, in the first Ages, 'tis every where apparent by <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, that the only way of avoiding Error, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was to adhere to the Bishop in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Doctrin: And whosoever departed from him, and from that Form of wholesome words kept by him, was supposed to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. </p>

                  <p>Sundry (saith he) in profession Protestants, in eagerness of opposition to the Papists, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the Church, or Spiritual Pastors, must then only be believed, then only obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they give Sentence according to the evident and express Law of God, made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Heart and Consciences of such as must believe and obey them. And this, in one word, is to take away all Authority of Spiritual Pastors, and to deprive them of all Obedience: Unto whom, doubtless, God, by his Word, hath given some special Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Right, to exact some peculiar obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Flock.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Pastor be then only to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he brings evident commission out of Scripture for those particulars, unto which he demands Belief, or Obedience; what obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do men perform to him, more than to any other man whatsoever? For, whosoever
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56964:202"/>
he be, that can shew us the express, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Command of God, it must be obeyed of all. But whilst it is thus obeyed, it only, not he that sheweth it unto us, is obeyed.</p>
                  <p>And if this were all the Obedience, that I owe unto others, I were no more bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or obey, any other man, than he is bound to obey, or believe me: The Flock no more bound to obey the Pastors, than the Pastors the Flock. Yet certainly God, who hath set Kingdoms in Order, is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of such confusion in the Spiritual Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church.

And <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. he argues thus: <q>If every Discipline, although never so mean, and easie to be understood, requires a Master, or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, what can be a more temerarious Pride, than not to learn the Books of the Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or Mysteries, from the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <q>No man, that is not a Poet, presumes to read <hi>Terence</hi> without a Master: And will you venture upon the reading of those Books, which by the Confession of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all man-kind, are accounted Holy, and full of Divine Mysteries; and presume to give a judgment of the sense of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Master?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. he thus goes on: <q>Since it is so difficult a thing, to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God by Reason, Do you think, that all men are capable of comprehending the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which are produced to guide mens minds to this Divine Knowledge?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he; to induce his Friend <hi>Honoratus,</hi> in such Divine matters, to yield the guidance of himself, to <hi>Church-Authority:</hi> And then the <hi>Church Authority</hi> he would have him Submit to, he describes thus, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Which Church <hi>(saith he)</hi> hath obtained Supream Authority from the Apostolick See, by a Succession of Bishops, Hereticks in vain barking against it: Who were lastly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly by the judgment of the People,

partly by the Gravity or Authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and partly also by the Majesty, or Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Miracles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now, not to submit to this Authority, were the height of Impiety, or a precipitant arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

               </argument>
               <p>TO make this appear more fully, I will give you a brief Relation of the past proceedings of the Church, in the Decision of the Disputes concerning the Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and the Substantial Conversion of the Elements of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>This Real presence, and Substantial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and some Followers of his long ago denyed: Who being complained of, Two Councils were called one after another, at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Verseilis, Anno Domini</hi> 1050. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> Summoned, and he not appearing, his Heterodox Opinions were condemned. He (according to the now Protestant Grounds) thinking his a Doctrin of great consequence, and the Decrees of the Two Councils, a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Error; and that himself had manifest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Demonstration against it, judged himself freed from the obedience of silence, or noncontradiction, of these Councils. And so
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56964:205"/>
he, and his Followers publickly justified his Tenent, desiring a reversing, by some new Council, of the former sentence against it.</p>
               <p>Upon this revived Disturbance of the Church, another Council, Five years after, is Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Tours, Anno</hi> 1055. not far distant from <hi>Angiers,</hi> where he was Archdeacon. Here him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with others of his Party, where present, his Cause pleaded, his Demonstrations consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and after all, his Opinion again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; himself also Recanting it.</p>
               <p>The Council dismissed, he finds yet other new Reasons, and a greater strength in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and falls again to the abetting, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and spreading abroad his old Doctrin. A Fourth Council upon these new Troubles of the Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1059. Four years after the last, was called at <hi>Rome;</hi> where himself also was present. Some say, long Disputation there had, his new Plea for it was found too light, and rejected: And his Opinion, opposing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Conversion, again condemned, both by himself and Council, consisting of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Three Bishops.</p>
               <p>The Third time this man revolts, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes a Writing, (answered by <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> wherein he complains, That some particular Enemies of his swayed the former Council, and had made him to Swear Contradictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:56964:205"/>
These new Imputations occasioned a Fifth Council to be called at <hi>Rome, Anno Domini</hi> 1078. in which were new Disputings, his last Cavils censured, and the Article of a Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Conversion further vindicated; and his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Substance of Bread remaining, again condemned by this Council: And lastly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by himself.</p>
               <p>Such was the Sentence of Five General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the West; and the same Arguments then refuted, yet are still urged; as will appear by the Writers of those times, <hi>(Lanfranck, Guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus, Algerus,)</hi> to any one that pleaseth to peruse them: The same Authorities out of the Fathers then pressed, as are still produced a new by the Reformed, and with the same Answers repelled. All these Councils (if some of them in the Members thereof, less numerous, yet) universally accepted by all the Western Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; where this Controversie was only agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Not one single Bishop thereof (that is known) dissenting, or siding with the <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> Look we for more satisfaction yet?</p>
               <p>When the Fervor of parties, in this matter, was much allaied, and the Church had had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient leisure to consider, and digest the former Conciliary Decrees, above an Hundred years after the last of the Councils fore-mentioned, the great <hi>Lateran</hi> Council was assembled, under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third; in which were present the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56964:206"/>
person, and the Substitutes of the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Patriarch (ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the <hi>Saracen</hi> yoak) <hi>Germanus,</hi> his Deacon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">['Tis true indeed, that some of These Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were then <hi>Latins</hi> or belonging to the <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Western</hi> Church; because both <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being held in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session (the one for neer 60, the other for neer 100 years) by the <hi>Latins; Latin</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were then Elected: As sometimes <hi>Greeks</hi> also, by the Power of the Emperors, have been Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> But yet they were the Lawful, and the only Patriarchs of those Sees, at that time.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And present there were besides These, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number of other <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops; the whole Council consisting of <hi>four hundred and twelve</hi> Bishops, and <hi>seventy</hi> Archbishops. Now this Council again, instead of reversing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for a Substantial Conversion: Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so first (that is, in a Council) was used the Name of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Hundred years after this, again, the Council at <hi>Florence</hi> declared likewise for the same, in the Articles of Instruction for the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins,</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> in these words: <q>By force of the Words of Christ, the Substance of Bread is converted (or changed) into the Body of Christ; and the Substance of Wine into his Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:56964:206"/>
Now if the Decrees of so many Councils, so often weighing the Adversaries Reasons, and Evidences, was not sufficient for setling such a Point, what can hereafter be sufficient! Or how can we ever hope, that any Controversie shall be finally determined, or ended, by any future Council! Can there be any ground here, to question the integrity, or lawful proceedings of so many Councils, at such a distance from one another? All concuring in the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a Real Presence, and a Substantial Conversion. Or can there be any <hi>New Light</hi> in this Point, (since there are no <hi>New Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)</hi> attainable in these present times, which those were never capable of? Or, if there could, is not much the <hi>major</hi> part of the present Clergy, and Ecclesiastical Governors of Christianity, still swayed on the same side, against any present Evidence pretended? How then can the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, reviving the former Arguments of <hi>Bertram, Scotus, Erigena, Berengarius, &amp;c.</hi> still trouble the Church again, with urging the same Arguments, after the judgment of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Councils already passed upon them?</p>
               <p>Can any desire a fairer Judicature by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, in any matter, than there has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this? And is there any reason, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants should refer themselves in this Point (as they do) to the judgment of a new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? If all the Councils Successively erred in this Point, so manifestly, as that they could not
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:56964:207"/>
lawfully oblige their Subjects to obedience, the next, and the next to that, of such Councils as ever we can hope for, may err so too, and the same Obedience be denyed to them; whilst one pretended Evidence, or Demonstration, quelled, another new one starts up, and demands satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>But if these Councils be invalid, or not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the establishing the belief of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Conversion, let us see the Proceedings of the Reformation here, to repeal their Acts, and to establish the contrary to them.</p>
               <p>After all these Councils fore-named, and that of <hi>Trent</hi> added to them, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1562. a Synod is called at <hi>London,</hi> of Two Provinces only of the West, consisting of about Twenty four Bishops, and Two Metropolitans: And by These, against all the former Councils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-said, it is Decreed, <hi>(Articulo</hi> 28.) That <q>the change of the Bread and Wine in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, and overthrows the nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus that Article.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in obedience to this their Decree, they tie their Subjects to subscribe, that <hi>they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it</hi> (that is, believe it) <q>to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God.</q> [See their Synod 1603. <hi>Can.</hi> 63.] This is an Obedience, which themselves (though Subjects) do deny to the Decrees of all those precedent Councils; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the judgments of all the Bishops and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56964:207"/>
of the <hi>Western</hi> World then concurred; and amongst the rest, Those of these Two Provinces also: And yet doth their Synod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
               <p>Here let a Sober Christian judge, if Assent be held due to this <hi>London-Synod,</hi> is it not to those others much rather? To those others, I say, incomparably more numerous, accepted by the <hi>West</hi> for many Ages, and adher'd to still by the greatest part thereof: Having before them the Scriptures, and the Traditive Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of them; weighing the Arguments, that are still on foot; meeting so often, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding still in the same judgment.</p>
               <p>But if those other Councils are justified, by the Practice of this English Synod, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Assent, and Obedience, then is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation rendred unlawful; as likewise their Appeal to future Councils; which can afford us no more just satisfaction, than the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd.</p>
               <p>Here you have seen, that for the Deciding this Controversie, a General Council (that is, the most General that the Times would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) was Assembled in the <hi>West;</hi> nay, of These more than One, as has been shewed: <hi rend="margQuotes">A Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Conversion of the Elements, and Real Presence,</hi> declared to be the Sense of those Scriptures, and a reverence suitable required in this great Mystery: Not one Bishop in these Councils (for any thing we know) Dissenting;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56964:208"/>
and Those of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches Absent, consenting in the same judgment. What more can be done? Ought not <hi>Sense, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> here, be silenced? And ought not such a Decree rather be Assented to, than the contrary Decree of the fore-mentioned Synod called at <hi>London?</hi>

                  <p>As for the Curses which were usually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Founders of these Religious houses, whither they have attended those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olators of what they so Zealously, and with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout minds had Dedicated to Gods Service, I will not take upon me to say: But sure I am, that after King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished this work he thrived but a little (as I shall elsewhere in particular observe.) And how long such Possessions have been enjoyed by those that had them, they that have looked into the course of this World may easily see.

                  <p>The next thing whereof I am to take notice, in Relation to this Friery, is King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Survey, in 26 of his Reign: At which time it did appear, that they had no Lands or Tenements; nor other Possessions Spiritual or Temporal, but only a liberty in the Country to receive the Charity of good people. This being so, I expect that some may demand why it was not Dissolved in 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. when the lesser Houses went to wrack? Whereunto I answer, that the Act for that purpose, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only unto Monks, Chanons, and Nuns: But if it be asked, why these were then so shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the first storm? the reason I think is apparent, <hi>viz.</hi> There was nothing to be got by their ruin, for as much as they had no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho God was as much dishonored by the lewd lives of the Friers for want of good Government (as the Preamble of that Act imports, in case it say true) as by any other whose Houses were certified to be of less value than 200<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> which favor we see gave those poor Friers liberty to breath here a while longer in expectation of their Ruine; <hi>viz.</hi> till 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that all the great Houses were dissolved.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Now the reason and signification of all these Ceremonies follows, which I here for Brevity, omit; resolving to speak a word or two of the cause, wherefore Churches do bear the Name of some Saint (by which many of them are yet distinguished) altho the Consecration or Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were unto none but unto God alone; wherein I shall make use of St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: To them (saith he speaking of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints) we appoint no Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not to us as Gods, Again, The Nations to their Gods Erected Temples, we not
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:56964:213"/>
Temples unto our Martyrs as unto Gods, but Memorials as unto dead Men, whose Spirits with God are still living. So that hereby is clearly manifest, that as they were dedicated to God alone, so was it in memory of some special Saint; either (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> observes) because by the Ministery of Saints it pleased God, there to shew some rare effect of his power, or else in regard of Death, which those Saints having suffered for the Testimony of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> did thereby make the places, where they died, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable. Thirdly for that it liked good and vertuous men to give such occasion of menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning them often, to the end that the naming of their Persons might cause enquiry to be made, and meditation to be had of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>

Paul</hi> the Hermite, St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Hilarion,</hi> St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome:</hi> but of these <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite was of greatest note for his retired living: who, to avoid that cruel persecution which raged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Decius,</hi> betook himself to the vast solitary Wilderness, where he lived 93 years unknown to any. But in the times of these Men they had no certain Rule: for every one being free, regulated himself as he saw best for his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al advantage, exercising devout prayers, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fastings, hard studies, with mean and slender diet, which they acquired by the labour of their hands, thereby giving great examples of pious living to all Posterity. So that St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> is the first unto whom some do chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the original of this Monastick profession, in regard he first so wonderfully raised up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of all to lead this kind of life; and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Rule for Monks, as St. <hi>Basil</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Greece,</hi> and St. <hi>Hilarion</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> Which <hi>Anthony</hi> lived in the Desert of <hi>Thebes</hi>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:56964:214"/>
(a part of <hi>Egypt)</hi> and there built a Monastery; where, with <hi>Sarmatus, Amatus,</hi> and <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> his disciples, wholly exercising himself in devout prayers, he fed upon nothing but Bread and Water; being so famous for his holiness, that <hi>Helina</hi> the Mother of <hi>Constantine,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her self and her Son by Letters to him, and dyed in the Wilderness in the year of Christ 360. aged 105 years.</p>
                  <p>But about 166 years after the death of <hi>Anthony,</hi> one <hi>Benedictus Nursinus,</hi> born in <hi>Umbria,</hi> a region of <hi>Italy,</hi> having long lived in much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, at length came to <hi>Sublacum,</hi> an eminent Town of the Latins, distant from <hi>Rome</hi> near 40 Miles: And to avoid company, in regard many for his sanctity resorted to him, shortly betook himself to <hi>Cassinum,</hi> a very ancient place in that Country; and there setling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, gatherd together the disperst and singly wandring Monks into one Monastery, institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting certain Forms and Rules for their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: Howbeit, the first that gave Laws and Rules to Monks was <hi>Basil,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocea;</hi> who about the year of Christ 363. being very famous for his Learning and Piety, obliged such as should enter into Orders to vow Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience to their Superior: But <hi>Benedict</hi> assign'd to his Monks a special kind of habit, and appointed them a certain Form for praying, slender diet, and a new rule of abstinence: And that, except in
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56964:214"/>
case of sickness, they should wholly forbear flesh. Which sort of Monks increased exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; yet, differing in some particulars from their first Rule, did in time subdivide themselves into several companies, whence grew the <hi>Cluni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acenses, Camalduenses, Vallis-Umbrenses, Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livetenses, Grandimontenses, Cistercienses, Silve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strenses, Celestines,</hi> and <hi>Heremitanes</hi> of St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> Which Monks of St. <hi>Benet</hi>'s Rule, as their tradition is, do wear a black Coat loose and divided down to their heels, with a Cowl or hood for their head, that falling over their shoulders is shorter than others use: and under all have a woollen whith Coat; as also a Hair shirt, with boots to the knees; their heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shaved with a Razor below the midst by reason whereof the top of the head so shaved is called <hi>Corona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now that I am thus come to speak of their shaving, It will not be amiss to shew upon what occasion this custom was taken up by the Monks, <hi>Dum beatus Petrus Antiochiae praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret</hi> (saith my Author) whil'st St. <hi>Peter</hi> preacht at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Gentiles, by way of contumely towards the name of Christians, shaved the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry top of his head, which afterwards was held a great honour to the religous, and those of the Clergy. But further of such shaving see <hi>P. Stellartius de coronis &amp; tonsuris, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. And here might I add somewhat touching the usage to the Monks of this Order in the time of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56964:215"/>
their sickness, especially towards the point of death; as also of washing the body being dead, with the ceremonies of burial, were it proper for this place: but I will conclude with insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the form of their admission into the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. <hi>Ego frater A. promitto stabilitatem meam, &amp; conversionem morum meorum, &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam secundùm regulam St.</hi> Benedicti <hi>Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, coram Deo &amp; omnibus Sanctis ejus, in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia domini Abbatis N. ad monasterium St.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae Coventriae: And shall refer my Reader to <hi>Clem.

                  <p>Touching the beginning of a Monastick life here in <hi>England,</hi> if we look after the particular persons, who in time of persecution fled to Woods, Caves, and deserts for preservation, it will be hard to point out the first that so retired themselves: but if we consider their first being gathered into any Covent, then certainly those of <hi>Glastonbury</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> will have the preheminence; in the later whereof, as <hi>Beda</hi> tistifieth, there were so great a number, that being divided into Seven parts, each having a several Ruler, every part was no less in number than 300, all which lived by the labour of their hands: Howbeit, these cannot be said (for ought I know) to have lived under any other Rule than the <hi>Esseans</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi> of whom <hi>Ploydore</hi> speaketh.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56964:215"/>
to come unto those times that the Order of <hi>Benedictin Monks</hi> was first transplanted into <hi>England,</hi> we are not to look higher than <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> the Monk; who, about the year of Christ 595. (as saith my Author) was sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Pope <hi>Gregory;</hi> whereupon Episcopal Sees were established in sundry places and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastries built for Monks observing the rule of St. <hi>Benedict;</hi> so that shortly after there were none in <hi>England</hi> but of that Order, which first began to be exercised in the Abbey of <hi>Glaston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> whereas before that time they lived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Egyptian Covents (saith he:) And which was so famous in ancient time, especially through <hi>England,</hi> that before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest there was scarce a Monastery of any other, as I have especially observed.</p>

                  <p>For its Original, I shall deliver the substance of what an approved Author hath thereof. <hi>In Burgundia est locus qui dicitur Molismus, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>In <hi>Burgundy,</hi> saith he, is there a place called <hi>Molisme,</hi> where, in the time <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France, Robert,</hi> an Abbot, having built a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, and thither gathered a Covent of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Monks, after a time searching diligently into the strict Rules of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> would have perswaded his disciples, that they ought to live by the labour of their hands, leaving Tithes and Oblations to the secular Clergy, abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56964:216"/>
from any breeches either of Cloth or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but they incling to the custom observed in the Western Monasteries, which were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by St. <hi>Maure,</hi> the disciple of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> and of St. <hi>Columbanus;</hi> and of latter time by St. <hi>Odo</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cluni,</hi> said, they would not recede from the same. Whereupon the said <hi>Robert</hi> departed from them, with one and twenty which were of his mind, seeking long for such a place, where they might live and observe St. <hi>Benets</hi> Rule as strictly as the Jews did the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And at the length <hi>Odo</hi> D. of <hi>Burgnndy,</hi> favoring their devout purposes, bestowed on them certain Lands in a place called <hi>Cisteaux,</hi> in the Bishoprick of <hi>Chalons,</hi> where the said Abbot <hi>Robert,</hi> with the rest, for some time inhabited; by example of whose strict and holy life in that Wilderness, many began to do the like. But, in time, the Covent at <hi>Molisme</hi> wanting a Pastor to govern them, complained to Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> shewing unto him the inconveniences that they sustained by reason thereof; who having a paternal affection to both places, commanded Abbot <hi>Robert</hi> to go back thither, substituting some one of those Monks at <hi>Cisteaux</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his room as Abbot there: whereupon he constituted one <hi>Alberic;</hi> to whom afterwards one <hi>Stephen</hi> an Englishman of great piety suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This plantation at <hi>Cisteaux</hi> was in the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56964:216"/>
year 1098. as the same Author affirmeth, with whom agreeth an ancient Chronical of the Church of <hi>Durham;</hi> further manifesting, that this Abbot <hi>Robert</hi> was an Englishman, his sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name <hi>Harding,</hi> and a Monk of <hi>Shirburne;</hi> who in his younger years, forsaking his habit, went over into <hi>France</hi> for advancement of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in learning; and coming to the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Molesme,</hi> before mentioned, was there shorne a Monk the second time, and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter became Abbot. Which Monks increased so much by the great conflux of Men to <hi>Cisteaux,</hi> that from thence almost 500 Abbies of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were sprung within the compass of 55 years: so that in a general Chapter held there by the Abbots and Bishops that were of that Rule, it was ordained, that from thenceforth there should be no more erected of that Order: for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastries were built in Deserts, and Woody places, by their own proper handywork; unto many whereof they gave special holy Names as <hi>Domus-Dei, Clara-vallis, Curia-Dei,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>Having said thus much of their original, I shall add a word or two of the strictness in their Rule, and so proceed with my discourse touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the further endowment of this Monastery.</p>
                  <p>First of their <hi>Habit,</hi> they wear no Leather nor Linnen, nor indeed any fine Woollen Cloth; neither, except it be in a journey, do they put on any Breeches, and then, upon their return
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:56964:217"/>
deliver them fair washt. Having two Coats with Cowles in Winter time, they are not to augment; but in Summer, if they please may lessen them: In which habit they are to sleep, and after <hi>Mattins</hi> not to return to their Beds.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Prayers</hi> the hour of <hi>Prime</hi> they so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that before the <hi>Laudes</hi> it may be Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, strictly observing their Rule, that not one jot or tittle of their service is omitted. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after <hi>Laudes,</hi> they sing the <hi>Prime,</hi> and after <hi>Prime</hi> they go out performing their appointed hours in work; what is to be done in the day, they act by day-light: for none of them, except he be sick, is to be absent from his Diurnal hours, or the <hi>Compline.</hi> When the <hi>Compline</hi> is finished, the Steward of the House, and he that hath charge of the guests go forth, but with great care of silence serve them.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Diet,</hi> the Abbot assumes no more liberty to himself than any of his Covent, every where being present with them, and taking care of his flock, except at meat, in regard his Table is always with the strangers and poor people: nevertheless wheresoever he eats is he abstemious of talk, or any dainty fair: nor hath he or any of them ever above two dishes of meat; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they eat of fat or flesh, except in case of sickness: and from the Ides of <hi>September</hi> till <hi>Easter,</hi> they eat no more than once a day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on Sundays, no not on any Festival.</p>
                  <p>Out of the precincts of their Cloyster they
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:56964:217"/>
go not but to work: neither there or any where do they discourse with any but the Abbot or Prior.</p>
                  <p>They unweariedly continue their Canonical hours, not piecing any service to another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Vigils</hi> for the decased. They observe the Office of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> so far as they could have perfect knowledge thereof from <hi>Millain:</hi> and taking care of strangers or sick people, do do devise extraordinary afflictions for their own bodies, to the intent their own souls may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged.</p>
                  <p>Which Rules were duly observed by the first Abbot and Covent; but afterwards somewhat was abated of that austerity: but their <hi>Habit</hi> is still white, and nothing different in the fashion from the Monks of St. <hi>Benedict's</hi> Rule, except a girdle, which these wear about their middle.</p>

                  <p>This Order was begun by St. <hi>Dominick</hi> a Spaniard in the time of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III, who being at first a Canon, with a few that he chose to be his companions, instituted a new Rule of strict and holy living; and lest they should grow sluggish in the service of God by staying at home, in imitation of our blessed Saviour, he appointed them to travel far and wide to preach the Gospel, their <hi>Habit</hi> being a white Coat with a black Cloak over it; which Order <hi>Honorius</hi> the III. (who succeded Pope
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:56964:218"/>
                     <hi>Innocent)</hi> confirmed; and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth, canonized him for a Saint. In <hi>Anno</hi> 1221. (20 <hi>H.</hi> 3.) they first came into <hi>England.</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>The first institution of this Order, as divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirm was <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, at <hi>Mount-Carmell</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> where; living a retired life in the service of God, he gave example unto many devout Anchorites to repair thither for solitude: but these being disperst over the whole mountain, in private Cells, were at length by <hi>Almeric</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> reduced into one Covent; at which time they elected cut of themselves a Superior, and first began the Fountain of a Monastery, where the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the blessed Virgin stood, <hi>viz.</hi> near the foundation of <hi>Helias.</hi> Howbeit, the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this life began not till the days of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, about the year 1170. Nor till the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, near 40. years after, had they any direct Order, that <hi>Albert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> prescribed unto them (thus living in the wilderness) a form out of St. <hi>Basills</hi> Rule, and a parti-colored Mantle of white and red, such a one as <hi>Helyas</hi> the Prophet anciently used; which afterwards <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third altered; conceiving it not to be so proper; and instead of the party-color, appointed that it should be all white, calling the Covent of these Friers <hi>the family of the</hi>
                     <pb n="431" facs="tcp:56964:218"/>
                     <hi>Blessed Virgin;</hi> in regard the white colour, being least spotted, doth best accord with Virginity.</p>
                  <p>But the first mention that I find of their propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating in this Realm, is in <hi>anno</hi> 1250. 34 <hi>H.</hi> 3. at which time Sir <hi>John de Vescy</hi> of <hi>Alnwike</hi> in <hi>Northumberland</hi> (a great Baron in those days) returning from the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> brought into <hi>England</hi> this Order of Friers, and built for them a Monastery at <hi>Holme,</hi> (in <hi>Northumberland)</hi> then a desert place, and not unlike to <hi>Mount-Carmel</hi> before mentioned.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>First therefore, as to their original, we shall find, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> (a person famous for his strict and holy life) was the Man from whom this Order sprung; whose birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place (being of a noble extraction) is said to have been at <hi>Assise</hi> in <hi>Umbria</hi> (a Province of <hi>Italy.)</hi> And that, in the very time of his youth, betaking himself to divine studies, no whit regarding the transitory pleasures of this present world, he afterwards neglected his patrimony, which was not small, wore a Coul or hair-shirt, went barefoot, and macerated himself with frequent watches and fastings. As also to the intent that he might make choice of voluntary poverty, he resolved to enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as his own, no not so much as food for his body, otherwise than what he received in Alms from good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And moreover, if he had any thing left, after a slender refreshment, he ever bestow'd it on the poor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving nothing for the morrow. That, in the night time he always slept in his cloaths, lying down upon a Matt, having no pillow for his head but a stone: And thus, going barefoot with an Evangelick preparation, did embrace an Apostolick life, preaching upon Sundays and Festivals in Parish-churches; which did so much the more work upon the hearts of his Auditory, by how much he was a stranger to all carnal desires. The Statutes of which Order, to this day observed, together with some other strict Rules, he presented to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third: Which together with the circumstances of his
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:56964:219"/>
reception, and their confirmation, I shall for brevity pass by.</p>
                  <p>To this resolution I shall briefly add what a later Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath of him; <hi>viz.</hi> that when he first betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to this regular life, he wore Shoos and a Leather Girdle; but revolving in his mind, that our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gave command to his Apostles, that they should not have two coats, nor any purse, he put on a single coat of plain wool, girt himself with a cord, and went barefoot. And at the length, that he might live an Anchorite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself to the <hi>Apenine-</hi>mountains, and in <hi>Av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>rne</hi> (at the foot of them) continued in great solitude; where devoting himself wholly to divine contemplations, he branded his Body with the marks of our Lords Passion, and called those <hi>Minors</hi> which he chose, from the first, to be his companions in that Rule, as a manifest token of his humility; to the end that they, being mindful of that slender appellation, should be free from all pride, which is oft times the companion of Sanctity.</p>
                  <p>His Rule being confirmed by <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third; and two years after; <hi>viz. anno</hi> 1229 <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX. Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing him for a Saint, no humane institution increased so much as this, in a short time, did: for they were soon spread over the whole Christian world; <hi>Terram reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt,</hi> saith <hi>Matt. Westm.</hi> In Towns and Cities they dwelt by tens and sevens in a Covent; and possessing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>erly living by the Gospel, in food and raiment they manifested their voluntary poverty; and going bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, girt with a knotty cord, gave the greatest example of humility imaginable.</p>
                  <p>Touching their first coming into <hi>England,</hi> I find it was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1224. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>viz.</hi> two years before the death of St. <hi>Francis.</hi>

Into their particular Cells, which are low built, and do contain 3 or 4 several rooms on the ground-floor only, having behind each of them a little Garden environ'd with an high Wall, is their diet brought to them by Lay-brothers, and put in at a little door in the wall, near the entrance thereof; unto which there is a lock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the key is kept by him that serves them. At the hours of publick prayers they meet in the Quire: But women are not permitted to come within the precincts of their <hi>Monastery,</hi> nor a man to speak with any of them without special license given by the Superior.</p>
                  <p>The Lay-brothers are not shaven; but their hair on the head is cut short and round; their habit being the same with the <hi>Monks,</hi> saving the scapular, which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but a little below the middle, and is girt close to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
