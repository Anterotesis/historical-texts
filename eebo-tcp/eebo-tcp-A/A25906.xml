            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Dreames which ariſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and Carnall affection, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; As an Vſurer to dream of gold; or any other carnall men, when they dreame of ſuch things as their natures are prone and ſubject unto. But our Authour <hi>Artimedorus</hi> doth not agree with them in their opinion, but ſaith, dreames of any importance, or which come of God, are farre different from
<pb facs="tcp:48023:6"/>
their effect and the experience of them. And contrariwiſe he affirmes, that thoſe Dreames which are ſhapen to our affections and thoughts, are to ſpeak ingenuouſly, as much as nothing, and wee muſt take no heed of them. And ſurely, I am confident, that an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Whoremaſter, an avaritious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, an envious perſon, or an ambitious man, a flatterer or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, or a common and notorious drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, do not commonly ſee any good dreame, or any dreame that tendeth to the honour or profit, eyther of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his friends, or of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But it oftentimes commeth to paſſe, that an honeſt, pure, chaſte, and vertuous man, (becauſe he is exempt from humane fragility) I thinke may and ſhal often ſee and interpret dreams and Viſions; To the ſafety, honour, and profit of himſelfe, his friends, and the Common wealth: For aſmuch as his ſpirit is leſſe bound, tyed and ſoyld with the fellowſhip of the body. In
<pb facs="tcp:48023:6"/>
the Holy Scripture, we have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both in the Old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the husband of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> repeateth the Propheſie of <hi>Ioell:</hi> whereby he ſheweth, that it was no new thing if God ſent Viſions and Dreams. There are other places in the Holy Scriptures, which I ſhall forbear here to inſert, theſe being ſufficient to prove the antiquity of them. Touching humane Hiſtories, you may ſee much of the iſſue and experience of dreames: <hi>Virgils</hi> Mother when ſhe was with childe of him, dreamed that ſhe ſaw a branch of Lawrell growing, and ſhe brought forth a Poet, to whom given a Lawreat Crown. Alſo <hi>Hecuba</hi> Queen of <hi>Troy,</hi> when ſhe was with childe of <hi>Paris,</hi> dreamt that ſhe ſhould bring forth a fire brande, which ſhould at once conſume the whole Country, and it afterwards proved true: for the ſaid <hi>Paris</hi> of whom ſhe was delivered, was
<pb facs="tcp:48023:7"/>
cauſe of the ruine, burning and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Troy: which was interpreted by his ſiſter <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> to whom they gave no credit; whereupon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ceized not onely upon the King and Queen, father and mother of the ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> but alſo upon all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whoſe miſerable deſtruction is reproved to this day. <hi>Socrates</hi> dreamt that he ſaw a little Swan in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his lap whoſe feathers grew, and preſently ſpreading his wings and flying on high ſang a ſweet and harmonious ſong. And the day following, <hi>Plato</hi> came to him to be his Scholler, who by his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge ſoard high, and by his eloquence ſang ſweetly. King <hi>Aſtiages</hi> dreamt when his daughter was with childe, that there would ariſe from her nature a Vine, growing ſo faſt, that the boughs thereof ſhould overſhade the Regions of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which afterwards fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: for ſhe bore <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great King of Perſia: which was the
<pb facs="tcp:48023:7"/>
Maſter and Lord of all thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. I might beſides alledge <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, father to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whoſe dreame <hi>Alexander</hi> the Philoſopher expounded: and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Expoſition it fell out. Alſo <hi>Cicero, Haniball, Calphurnia,</hi> and many others, which had Dreams and Viſions by night, whoſe effects came to paſſe, as great and divers Hiſtories do verifie. But for brevities ſake, I ſhall forbeare to inſtance any more particulars, leſt I ſhould offend my Reader, with preſuming too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his patience. Leſſe I would have ſaid, but was loth to leave the curious unſatisfied. And to conclude, it ſeems to me great arrogancy in any man to ſay, that all Viſions and Dreames are vain and of none effect, which hath already been proved falſe, by many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories both divine and humane: and I think it were to diſpute againſt God, and wrong to the ſoul of man, which is (indeed) the mirrour of heavenly
<pb facs="tcp:48023:8"/>
things; in making it alwayes in all things unprofitable, a Vagabond, vain, and idle; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when the body reſteth, the ſoul ſeemeth moſt to raign and rule in his force and vertue, and in her ſpirituall, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and intellectuall Nobility. Wherefore I will agree in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Socrates,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That man whether he live or dye, is in the hands of GOD:</hi> who takes all his affayrs in his hand, and in care diſpoſeth there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his pleaſure, and forewarns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>IF any one dreams that he comes out of a womans belly, as to be borne into the world, he muſt judge in this force. This dream is good for him which is poore, for he ſhall have means or friends which will maintain him: if he be not a trades-man, &amp; of an art which requireth the work of the hand, for this dream forewarns him that he ſhal be without work, as children which have their hands bound together. To him which is rich this dream ſignifieth that he ſhall have no rule in the houſe, but others ſhal overrule him againſt his will, for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are govern'd by others. To him whoſe wife is not with child, it ſignifieth that he ſhal looſe his wife, for children are not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, nor come at women. But to him whoſe wife is with child, it ſignifies that he ſhall have a ſonne in all things like himſelfe. And hee ſhall bee ſo like him as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were borne twice. To Champions and combatants this dream is ill, For children can neither goe nor run, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſaile any man. To him which is in a far country that he ſhall return home, as if he ſhould return to his beginning, then he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48023:11"/>

Hee which hath a wife ſhall looſe her, having no more need that ſhe ſhall beare children. He which hath no wife ſhal have a gentle one. To others it ſignifieth ſicknes. But to be big with child and then to be delivered, is all one, for it meanes that the ſick perſon ſhall dye quickly. But to him that is poor and indebted, induring pain and miſery, it is an end &amp; a diſcharge of all his preſent evils, alſo this dreame revealeth ſecrets. This dreame is croſſe to rich uſurers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and all ſuch as are in authority, for that which they had before, they ſhall looſe.

But the male children bring good ſucceſſe, daughters bring an end worſe then the beginning, for they are married with a dowry. I know a man which dream't that he had a daughter borne, and hee borrowed mony for intereſt; and on the contrary ſide I knew another, which dream't that hee buried his daughter deceaſed, and it fel out that hee was conſtrained to pay a debt for which he was bound. So then his daughter made agreement with the debt. But to ſee other mens children is good when they are faire and well favoured, for this ſignifieth that a good and happy time is at hand.</p>

But if any one being in priſon hath ſuch a dream, the Devill ſhall ſtir up ſuch accuſations againſt him, that he ſhall not be delivered, and it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon to judge the like in ſicknes.

Moreover, I have knowne by experience, that this dream foretold to one that was not married a wife, &amp; to one that had no children, it foretold children; but to a Champion, and an artificer, and all ſuch as in their eſtate travaile &amp; move the body, it ſignifieth ſickneſſe.

                     <p>TO be changed from little to great, and from great again to bigger, ſo that you excéed not reaſon is good, for it is increaſe of buſineſſe and goods: but to be greater then common vſe, is death. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is ill for an old man to be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a yong man, or a yong man into a childe, for they ſhall change to a worſe eſtate: but the contrary is good, for they ſhall come to a better eſtate. To dream to be a woman, is good for a poore man, and a ſervant: for the firſt ſhall finde thoſe which will cheriſh him as a woman, and the ſecond ſhall have leſſe paine: but to a rich man, it is ill; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if he have government of any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thing, it takes away his office and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe women muſt kéepe the houſe. To ſuch as exerciſe bodily labour, it is ſickneſſe: for women are commonly weaker then men. If a woman dream that ſhe is a man, and ſhe be not married, ſhe ſhall have a husband, or if ſhe have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhe ſhall have a ſonne, or ſhall be ſome way changed into the nature of a man: but if ſhe be both married, and have a ſonne, ſhe ſhall be a Widdow. To a Maid ſervant

it ſignifies ſhe ſhall have great ſervitude, and undergo pain as a man. It is good for a harlot, for ſhe ſhall leave her wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Again, if a poor man or woman dreame that they are made all of gold, they ſhall be rich: but if they be rich, they ſhall be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented. For gold and ſilver have us Spies: to a ſick perſon it is death. To be of braſſe is good for a Warriour and a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: for the one ſhall have Victory and a Statue erected, and the other ſhall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. To dreame that you are of Iron, foretelleth infinite miſeries. To be all of Earth betokeneth death, except ſuch as live by earth; as Potters. To be of Stone, is to receive blows and wounds: if one dream he is changed into the ſhape of a Beaſt, he muſt judge according to the beaſts nature, and of that I will intreat in the Second Books, in my diſcourſe of the Chaſe. I have obſerved, that it is good for all to dream they are fair, and of good grace, and ſtrong, and yet without excéeding common cuſtome: for to be too faire, too brave, and too ſtrong, is as much as to be ill favoured, faint hearted, and weak, which things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie death to the Sick, and to Lovers ill ſucceſſe, and attachment for treaſon.</p>

To play the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Plowman, to ſow, or plant, is good to him which ſeeks a wife, or which hath no children: for the Field is his wife, the ſeed and trees his children, the wheat males, the barley females, and abortives: to others this dreame betokeneth ſickneſſe and anger: if any one be ſick in the houſe where this dream is, it ſignifyeth death: for the ſéed and plants are put in the earth as the dead.

To govern a ſhip, if one have good ſucceſſe and honour without perill, provided that it be without doubt or pain, it is good, but if one be troubled with tempeſts, or if the ſhip be bruiſed and broken, it is abundance of evill, which I have often known by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: to cut and ſowe in leather, to married folks is good. It is alſo good for him which would marry or get acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and allyes, by reaſon of cloſe and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeames. But to dye leathers is ill to all, and revealeth ſecrets. To ſée medicines is worſt of all: to be a goldſmith ſignifyeth harme to him which dreames it, by reaſon of the poyſons and inſtruments that they handle: to be a graver, turner, or carver, of images and figures. is good for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, pratlers, cooſeners, and deceivers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their arts ſhew other effects then the true.

                     <p>A Sheep ſignifieth advancement, and obtaining of goods, wherefore it is good to dreame you have many of them, or ſee them of others and feed them: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe which deſire to handle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and charge of people, and thoſe which have attained thereto already: it is alſo good for Sophiſters, Pedaunts, and Schoole-maſters. The Ramme ſignifieth the Maſter, or the Prince and King. It is good to dreame to be lifted on high ſurely, and by plain and eaſie places, eſpecially for Orators, Atorneys, Proctors, and all thoſe which have deſire to heap up gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by his labour. Goats ſignifie no good
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48023:47"/>
but are worſe to Navigators. Aſſes bearing charge, ſtrong, and obedient, are good for friendſhip and company, and ſignifie the Wife, companion, or friend; being not proud above their eſtate, or fierce, but gentle, and very obedient, and they are alſo good in all affairs and enterpriſes. Mules are good for al works, eſpecially to huſbandry, only they croſſe weddings and procreations. If the Aſſes or Mules are hot or mad, and do any hurt, or be ſavage, it argueth deceit, by ſome of our owne houſe, or ſubjects. Mules alſo ſignifye ſickneſſe, as I have known by experience. Oxen in labour are good for all, but in a heard they are trouble divulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perill: the Bul ſignifies any great perſonage, eſpecially if they threaten and purſue you; to Mariners it is tempeſt, and if he wound you, it is hurt and ſhipwrack, by ſome inconvenience which ſhal fall from the top of the Maſt, as I have often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, and it daily often falls out. Thus much ſhall ſuffice concerning domeſticall and familiar Beaſts. Now let us ſpeake of Wilde and Savage Beaſtes. To ſée a gentle, familiar and fawning Lyon, ſignifyes good, and profit: by the King to a man of warre: by the ſentence of the Judges to the Wreſtler or Fencer: by the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48023:48"/>
Magiſtrate to the Mechanick, and by the Maſter to the ſervant. For the Lyon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents theſe perſons for his force and might; but if he be hot, and would hurt, it ſignifies fear and ſickneſſe, and threatning by ſuch perſons, and danger of fire: to ſée, or have the forehead of a Lyon, is good for all; and moſt often the begetting of a manchild: the Lionneſſe ſignifieth as the Lyon, only leſſe goods, and leſſe hurts, and not by men, but by women. I have alſo known by this dreame of a Lyonneſſe ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or byting, rich perſonages have falne into crimes and accuſations: the Leopard ſignifieth (both the man and the woman) wicked and deceitfull, by reaſon of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of colours: alſo people of a ſtrange Countrey, ſickneſſe, exceeding feare, and ſore eyes: the ſhe Beare ſignifyeth the Wife, ſickneſſe, and return from a ſtrange Country: the Elephant ſeen in a dreame, is feare and danger. I have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and knowne, that the Elephant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting one, ſignified ſickneſſe: and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and killing one, ſignifyed death. I knew in Italy a rich and healthful woman, which dreamt that ſhe was mounted upon an Elephant, and ſhortly after dyed. You muſt underſtand that every wilde beaſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48023:48"/>
repreſenteth our enemies, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is alwayes better to overcome them then to be overcome of them: the Wolfe ſignifieth the yeare, and a cruell Enemie hunting plainly againſt us. The Foxe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the ſame that the Wolfe, and an Enemy hunting ſecretly, by ſurpriſing and ſpying; and moſt often deceit by a woman: the Ape ſignifyes a Malefactour and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: the Wilde Bore ſignifyeth Raine and Tempeſt to thoſe which travaile, and to ſuch as pleade a ſtrong Adverſarie, to Plowmen ſterilitie, and to him which marrieth, a rude and angry Wife: to ſhips it ſignifies the governance and courſe, and in land journeyes, the way eaſie or hard to hit, according to the diſpoſition of the heart. In other places it ſigni yes, that there are fugitives and deceivers, falſe and perjured Perſons, fearfull, and unaſſured. One may judge of every other Beaſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former manner, and by thoſe to whom they appertaine. And you muſt remember, that domeſticall Beaſts which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew themſelves fierce and ſavage, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye ill: and contrariwiſe cruell and ſavage Beaſts, which in your dreame repreſent themſelves gentle, and domeſticall, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifye good.

it is an admirable thing, and more then may be found again in the world, to come to the end of a thing ſo confuſed and ſtrange as dreams are.

But becauſe that ſo often my ſpirit repreſented to me this Mulbery tree, I was moved, and as it were conſtrained to ſeek for it. I took this Book, and read therein. He which ſees a Mulberry
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48023:68"/>
tree, right and bearing fruit, it ſignifieth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and generation unto him. And follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſpeech, I would often ſay to certain of my friends, that I believed I ſhould have by my wife a childe, which ſhould live and not dye at her birth, as my daughter did; I could in this caſe alledge many other caſes and dreams, whoſe iſſue have faln out in all points, according to the expoſition of <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medorus;</hi> but for brevities ſake I will omit them, hoping that you will beleeve as much, and take this inſtead of more, the effect whereof your ſelfe knew lately to happen, to the great joy and delight of me and my friends. But I muſt adviſe you that as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects of dreams, you muſt not ever ſeek them or hope for them at the ſame time that you dream them, for many times they come to paſſe four, five, or ſixe moneths, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you dreamt them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt likewiſe give you notice, that this third Book of <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> is as a Book ſet apart, and ſeparated from the other two, which appeareth by the Authors concluſion in the end of his Second Book; and indeed, this Book was compoſed long time after the other. For the Author ſeeing that in the two former Books, there wanted ſome things which the diligent and curious Readers
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48023:69"/>
might deſire, laid on an heap, and gathered together the things contained in this third Book; which he would not adde to the two former, for the reaſon which he giveth in the end of the ſecond Book: nor yet would make it a Book by it ſelf, but rather gives it the ſame title. Becauſe it ſo depends upon the two former, that in ſome ſpecches they may ſeem to be repeated again, unleſſe one have the better judgement. But without cauſe he repeats nothing, for it is eyther for amplification, or diverſity of Expoſition.</p>

But you muſt know that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48023:79"/>
there is nothing more tedious or difficult, then to underſtand the diverſity, compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mixtion of dreames, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Generall Rules for all kindes of dreames. Séeing that ſometimes, nay of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, one may ſée the ſame dreame, and at the ſame time of the night, or day, things contrary, and which have no reſemblance, or agréement. But it is impoſſible, that things ſignified by the ſelf ſame dreames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould differ or be repugnant among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if ſo be that the dreames foretell matters of import, which ſhall happen. For as in all other things there is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and dependance, ſo alſo is it very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſame falles out in dreams. When therefore one ſhall ſée in his dream things both good, and evill, then he muſt think with himſelfe, which were the firſt, and which were the laſt. For in worldly affayres, ſometimes even the greateſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of hope hath had iſſue: and on the contrary, the greateſt occaſions of doubt and feare, have had good iſſue: and for great evils which one hath expected, one hath found but ſmall; and for little hope of good, one hath found non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> at all. So that mixt and compounded dreams, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubtfull, and cannot eaſily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48023:80"/>
or expounded, which is a great griefe to many. But for my part I have writ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically, and in the beſt and eaſieſt order that I could, that every one might take an eaſie courſe in the expoſition of dreames. And as Schoole-maſters after they have taught their children the knowledge and property of any one letter, in particular, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards teacheth them how they muſt uſe them all together. In like-ſort, would I preſcribe certain little and eaſie rules, and foyne them to that which hath béen ſaid in my thrée former Books, to the end, that they may be the better learned and underſtood. For to ſuch as have had experience, and long practiſe, this will be very eaſie, and ſhall ſuffice to inſtruct them in all things what they ſignifie: to the purpoſe then. In our firſt Book we ſaid, that the Head ſignifies the Father of him that dreamt it. And in the ſecond, that the Lion ſignifieth the King, or Sickneſſe. And in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Death, that it is good for poore folks to dreame that they dye: when therefore any poore man (having his Father rich) dreames that a Lion comes to devoure or teare in pieces his head, and the ſame poor man ſéemes to remain dead, and without a head in his dream: it is likely that his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48023:80"/>
Father ſhall die, and he ſhall be his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yr: and by this meanes ſhall forgoe the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his poverty, and become rich, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he hath neither father nor poverty that ſhall kéepe him downe any longer. For in this dream the head repreſenteth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the loſſe of the head, the death of the father: the Lion, the ſickneſſe whereof his father ſhall dye. And death to the poore man is change of eſtate, ſhewing that by riches, his poverty ſhall be expelled. In ſuch ſort, one muſt leade himſelfe to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of all diverſe, and mingled dreames, of any whole Chapter, or ſpeech: gathering together, and making one onely expoſition, like as one Medicine is made of many hearbes and rootes. To which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I deſire all courteous Readers, who are deſirous to peruſe my Bookes, not to accuſe or blame them, before they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read and underſtood them. For I am confident, and dare affirm with great ſecurity, that my Bookes will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the learned and juditious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: nor by thoſe who are either ſtudious, diligent, or friendly Readers.</p>

                     <p>OF Dreames, ſome are Speculative, that is to ſay, which come (if one may ſo ſpeak) in the faſhion of the ſpirit, when the body reſteth: Others are. Allegoricall, that is to ſay, which ſhew under other things, thoſe things which they would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie; and are more hard to interpret: chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe one is in doubt whether the things will fall out as the ſpirit hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them, or in ſome other manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by them: wherefore firſt of all we muſt underſtand, that the effect of Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative dreams is brought to paſſe, if it ſhall happen at all: For all dreames have not an effect preſently, or ſoone after the dream. But the effect of Allegoricall dreames, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares ſometime after, either long or ſhort,

as a day or two. But it were fondneſſe in any man to think, that monſtrous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible things, ſhould happen as the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath ſeene them. And we muſt know, and note, that Artificers repreſent theyr Art, amongſt thoſe which are of the ſame art. As the Atturney which dreamt, that an other Atturney was ſick, was a long time without Clients: the Smith, which dreamt that he ſaw a Smith which was his Neighbor, carried to his grave; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards left his owne ſhop, and the Town wherein he dwelt. But to ſpeake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Apollonides a Chyrurgion, dreamt, that in Fencing he had wounded many, and by his Chyrurgery he had healed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and had great practiſe: for the intent of Fencers is to wound, but not to kill: the like doth the Chyrurgion. The Sick man dreaming he ſaw bread, ready to be ſet in the Oven, although the fruits of Ceres are ever good, yet notwithſtanding, it ſignified to him a great Feaver to come; becauſe thoſe Loaves were to be heated, and baked in the Oven. To him which would marry, or which would get affinity or company, it is better to dreame of the Vine, and wine, then of Corn, or Barley; and for him which deſireth to advance himſelf, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And yet to dream that little children ſpeak well is good, becauſe it is proper both to man and woman to ſpeake. But as for other things happening beyond theyr age in thoſe which are not very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, it was declared in the firſt Book, in the Chapter of alteration, and change: dreams which are of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, or of weddings, foretel that our children being in a farre Country, ſhal return; eſpecially the wife and children, if by chance any one hath took them from us: if one dreams to plough the earth, and ſow ſeed therein, it ſignifies the ſame.</p>
