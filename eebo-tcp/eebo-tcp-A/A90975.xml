            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Having well underſtood his game, he prepares his baits, thoſe whom he apprehends more ſolid, wiſe, moderate, judicious, of quick apprehenſions, reaching brains, good parts, and language, and withall notorious for Religion and popular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he firſt entertains with much <hi>civility,</hi> candor, and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carriages, very good, rational, and acceptable diſcourſe, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and framing the ſame after ſuch a manner as may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf an excellent Common-wealths man, full of a publique ſpirit, and furniſhed with rich and plentiful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and propoſitions, fairly comporting with publique good, and inſinuating (with what freedom or tenderneſs, plainneſs or covertneſs, they are able to bear) the many preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, burthens and grievances of the Common-wealth, and inſiſting (if at all) yet very ſlightly upon the Redreſſes, good, and benefit received from men in preſent authority; backing his diſcourſe of this nature either with ſome plauſible ſtories of the cunning and crafty behavior of Forreign Princes, or men in Power, pretending good for the Common wealth and doing many things very promiſing therunto, and at laſt exalting themſelves in the oppreſſions and vexations of the people, or elſe with obſervations of Domeſtique Polititians, once very famous for their pretended zeal for their Country, but when advanced, and lifted up, as infamous for their baſeneſs in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Tyranny: and by this means he is ſtill fomenting new and freſh jealouſies againſt thoſe that approve themſelves moſt faithful in Authority and Truſt, ever obſerving what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (if any ſuch thing do fall out) have been done by ſuch men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117294:7"/>
which may poſſibly <hi>(by wringing and wreſting, and malign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation)</hi> render them by his cunning art and skill (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dexterous that way) to be ſuſpected for Self-ſeekers, Juglers, and Deceivers of the People.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Having by this means crept into the good opinion, love and affections of his deceived friends, and new acquaintance (the reſult and iſſue of ſeveral meetings and conferences in order thereunto,) and hereby wounded their reſpects, and abated their zeal towards thoſe that have the management and ſteerage of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affairs in their hands, that he may make ſure work with them, with cunning &amp; curious art he attempts the undermining of their principles of Religion, but with a ſoft foot, and with much ſlight of hand, and (Juglar-like) as if he had paſt his Apprenticeſhip, and ſerved Journey-man to the grand deceiver of the world; he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his skill in caſting a miſt before them, and in blinding the eyes of their minds, that the great myſteries of Life and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrines of Juſtification by his Death and Reſurrection, Sanctification and Mortification by his Spirit, &amp;c. may appear but meer fantaſms, rediculous, irrational, ayry, vain, empty notions; but thus he attempts very artificially in theſe gradations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, (That he may raze the very Foundation, and lay his Ax at the very root of Religion,) he prepares his battery againſt the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, honor and authority of the holy Scriptures, as preſuming that to be (as indeed it is) the very firſt regal of Religion, the credit whereof being once loſt in the judgment, the conſcience, will and affections, will quickly ſurrender, even upon Satans terms; but before he ſpends his Ammunition, <hi>viz.</hi> his Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the ſame, with no ſmall ſubtilety patlies with them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the very ſame caſe, and to the very ſame end, that envious one to the preſence and eternal Intereſt of mankind, did inſinuate into a conference with our firſt parent by way of ſubtle and crafty queſtions, and hath God indeed ſald, <hi>ye ſhal not eat of every tree of the garden, &amp;c.</hi> even ſo this moſt perficient Schollar, doth not uſe in a down-right manner to deny the authority of the Scriptures, but like maſter-like man he ſets upon men quere-wiſe: How can you prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God? What ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity have you concerning the divine authority of the Scriptures,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117294:8"/>
and conſequently the articles of your belief, and the grounds of your faith, but from the teſtimony of men? What better grounds have you to beleeve the Scriptures came from God, then the Turks have for their Alcharon, or the Jews for their Talmud? not that he himſelf would ſeem to queſtion it, but if you will beleeve him, it is to underſtand how men are ſetled in their faith, and to help them therein; he writ for the defence of the divine authority of the Scriptures, (as Satan himſelf, when he did tempt the Lord Chriſt to deſtroy the Scriptures, in effect, by doing contrary to the Tenor thereof, did quote the very Scripture, ſaying, <hi>It is written, he ſhall give his Angels charge, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If he cannot preſently ſurprize their Judgments by, his ſubtile quries about the Scriptures, he waves the buſineſs for a ſeaſon, and takes another courſe, then he inſinuates the contradictions, opinions of men about matters of Religion, their various judgments, how oppoſite and croſs they are to themſelves (declining diſtinctions whereby they may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled) leading his diſciples upon the Lords Days from one Church to another, and ſtaying no longer then while ſomewhat drops from the mouth of the Miniſter, which he may through his art (not minding what went before, and what followed) render rediculous and weak, and ſo by degrees comes at laſt to improve all againſt the validity of Religion, preaching, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinances, this done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He entertains them with as much excellency and ſtrength of diſcourſe, as his capacities have attained, in ſetting forth the famous Governments of ſuch, and ſuch Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, the excellent readings of Phyloſophers, their moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

What kind of breeding ſuch States and Common-wealths gives their children in the ſtudy of martial diſcipline, feats of activity, geomitry, &amp;c. by all which means he endeavors ſtill to take off the minds of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples from Religion, and the thoughts thereof, if he ſees the deſired fruits of his labours, and that he hath gotten the Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which his ſoule doth ſo ſorely long for, <hi>viz.</hi> the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of poor men into the ſame condemnation with himſelf into
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117294:8"/>
low and contemptible thoughts of God, of Jeſus Chriſt, of the Spirit, of the Scriptures, of hearing the Word, Prayer, of Heaven, of Hell, &amp;c. then they become his boſom friends, and are friendly received into his houſe, and partake of his more intimate thoughts, and familiarity, as preſuming, that having perverted them, and ſtrengthened them in his moſt wretched ways, they might be able to go and do likewiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> pervert and ſtrengthen their brethren; and this is his method for the taking the more ſolid, able, judicious and intelligent men, which are the firſt ſort of men whom he ſeeks to ſeduce from their faithfulneſs and integrity to God and man.</p>
            <p>Before we come to ſhew his art in drawing aſide the other ſort of men, take ſome inſtances of his proceedings in the former kind, all which, with much more of this nature, ſhall be manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as occaſion is required.</p>
            <p>Having once upon a Faſt day (as his uſual manner was both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, and the Lords days) gone from place to place, hearing here a little, and there a little what the Miniſters ſaid, making it the ſubject matter of his prophane ſcorning and jeering, came at laſt to his own houſe with one of his ſuppoſed Faſt diſciples, (though even at that time his heart did riſe againſt <hi>Walwins</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but having got within him, he did reſolve, though with much reluctance of ſpirit, to fathom the deep devout hypocriſie of this man for a through detection of him,) being at home, he fetcht out that prophane ſcurtilous <hi>Lucians</hi> Dialogue, come (ſaid he) let us go read that which hath ſomething in it, <hi>Here is more wit in this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then in all the Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſpeaking of the book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That there was no heed to be given to them; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they were pen'd by Kings in order only to their own advantage, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of their own intereſt, as they were Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And another, a preſumed ſure friend (having ſome familiarity with this worthy Champion for, and aſſerter of the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures Mr <hi>Walwyn</hi>) profeſt, that this wretched man, <hi>Walwyn,</hi> ſpeaking of the book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſaid, That <hi>it was nothing elſe but one of Solomons Epiphonema's or Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Songs upon one of his Whores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time ſpeaking and diſcourſing of Hell, ſaid, that <hi>it</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117294:9"/>
               <hi>was a ſilly thing to think that there was any hell, or condemnation, which the Miniſters keep ſuch a noyce and prating about, and that all the hell that was, was that only which was in an ill mans conſcience in this life:</hi> and it being replyed, that the Scriptures ſpeak expreſly of hell, and eternal fire and damnation; he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is to be underſtood as the Scriptures alſo ſpeak, they are condemned already, <hi>viz.</hi> in their own conſciences, which is no more but this, they know they have not done well.</p>
            <p>At another time ſpeaking of hell, and everlaſting fire, and eternal torments, uſed words to this purpoſe, Piſh, do you think, can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your heart, to conceive, that God ſhould caſt a man into everlaſting burnings, where he ſhould be tormented for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, for a little time of ſinning in this world?</p>
            <p>Again, at another time ſpeaking and diſcourſing of Prayer, (ſaid he) What a ſilly thing it is for a man to drop down upon his knees, and hold up his hands, and lift up his eyes, and mumble over a few words for half an hour, or an hour together, as if this did pleaſe God, when all this while he might have been in doing that which is good in it ſelf, releeving the poor and oppreſſed; there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion but that which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in releeving the poor, judging the cauſe of the fatherleſs and widow, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, ſpeaking of keeping Sundays as we do, urged, That it was better on ſuch days to meet together, and ſpend our time in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what is good for the Common-wealth, read ſome good moral things, as <hi>Plutarchs Morals, Ciceroes Orations,</hi> then read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and hearing Sermons, glorying much of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table witty things in theſe moral Writers, and of the manner of their governing of States.</p>
            <p>Again, he did bemoan the ſimple practiſe of this Nation in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their children in learning Latin (forſooth) and the original Tongues, and I know not what, it were far better to train them up in feats of Activity, Geomitry, riding Horſes, exerciſing Arms, ſtudying Fortifications, and in ſuch things as may make them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>It would fill a Volume to declare the ſad and miſerable effects which by this means have been brought to paſs upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome of very able apt, and ingenious parts and abilities

corrupted by this Engliſh man-hunter; one of them, not long ſince (a man of very ſingular parts, and much ingenuity, that might have been very uſeful for this Common-wealth,) having been but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and lately acquainted with this wretch, ſpeaking with others about the nature of God, his Grace, Mercy and Goodneſs, moſt prophanely and lightly replayed, <hi>Yea, I hope God is a merry old man, and will make a good companion when I am dead.</hi> And again, one ſpeaking to him of the Sweetneſs and Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt; replyed, <hi>Yea, indeed Jeſus Chriſt is very ſweet, I love him better then Capons;</hi> but I ſhall rather inſiſt only upon his own expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Walwyn</hi> being asked by one of his intimate Friends, what he ſeriouſly thought concerning the Scriptures, whether they were the Word of God or no? Replyed thus, I'le open my heart plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto you, ſaid he, I beleeve it is not the Word of God, and I beleeve again it is the Word of God; I pray expound your ſelf, ſaid his friend; why, ſaid he, the Scripture is ſo plainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradictory to it ſelf, that makes me beleeve it is not the the Word of God; and yet again, all thoſe paſſages therein that declare the nature of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his Grace and Goodneſs to men, I beleeve are the Word of God, and ſo you have my meaning; oftentimes declaring, that he did not beleeve that God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men for ever for a little time of ſinning.</p>
            <p>There was a Gentlewoman (a Citizens wife, of very good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and well known) formerly very famous in the profeſſion of Religion, and of very great repute amongſt honeſt people, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of parts and abilities above the common ſtandard of her ſex, whoſe ſad and heavy condition it was to fall into acquaintance with this unhappy factor for the region of darkneſs, who (as her ſelf declared unto ſome, very nearly relating unto her) was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſeduced by this wretched man, who having improved his kill (with too much ſucceſs) in poyſoning her judgment touching the truth of the Scriptures, and the precious concernments of her ſoul, did frequently vent his moſt Atheiſtical and blaſphemous oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, ſcorns and ſcoffs againſt Religion, and the holy Scriptures, as theſe paſſages do abundantly witneſs.</p>
            <p>Upon a time ſpeaking of King <hi>David,</hi> ſaid to this purpoſe and effect, That <hi>King James, and King David were a couple of craſty</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117294:10"/>
               <hi>Foxes, and cunning Knaves, that by their ſubtlety and policy, under religious pretences, acted all things with a deſign of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and cozening their people over whom they were ſet, and that they were as like as ever he read of any two men in all his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time ſpeaking to the ſame woman, demanded, why ſhe did not come and ſee his wife? and moſt jeeringly and ſcoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly added, <hi>I proteſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou haſt ſin'd the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt for not viſiting my wife;</hi> or to that effect.</p>
            <p>At other times viſiting the ſame woman, and finding her in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a melancholy and ſad condition, (for indeed ſhe was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of quick and ripe apprehenſions in ſpiritual things, and could not likely degenerate from, and decline the ways of God without regret of ſpirit, and trouble of conſcience.) <hi>Come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we ſhall have you return to your religious mood again, you will never do well ſo long as theſe thoughts prevail with you;</hi> or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes did this wretched man ſuggeſt unto her to this purpoſe. <hi>That it was abaſe and ignoble thing for any one to lye under ſuch trouble, anguiſh, and perplexity, as could not well be endured, having ſo eaſie and ſpeedy a way of riddance out of it, as is before every man, and that it was an Honourable and valiant thing, for a man in ſuch a caſe to put an end to his life by laying violent hands upon himſelf, being a far ſhorter way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Scriptures, &amp;c. can notwithſtanding in this <hi>Manifeſtation.</hi> with a very devout and religious Pen (as if he had been the moſt pious aſſertor of the things of God) pretend to build his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort upon the Scriptures, as he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 4. of this <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> where he ſaith, that he could paſſe over the many wronge done unto him, upon this conſideration, <hi>Remembring what is promiſed to be the portion of good men.</hi> Again, <hi>pag. 5. We muſt ſuffer till God ſees fitting in good time to clear, &amp;c.</hi> With ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other ſtrains of this nature, as if Religion, and the affaires of the other world, God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit were the main things that guide him in all his waies; wherein both L. Col. <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> and others, know in their own conſciences, and have declared it, that they could never perceive him a man in the leaſt acquainted with the concemments of Religion, and the work of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Having declared the crafty and ſubtle wiles and methods of this artificiall and great Impoſtor, in his Satanicall work of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and deceiving the more able ſort of men, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſetting forth his Mountebankiſme in his Jeſuitical betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the weaker, more injudicious, and plainer ſort of people, and theſe likewiſe being of ſeverall tempers, conſtitutions, and conditions, he hath variety of Art to deceive them all.</p>
            <p>If they be of a low, needy, indigent, and wanty condition, as many of them are, he deales with them after this method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, (that he might hit the white of the mark in all his aimes, <hi>viz.</hi> wound the credit and authority of Religion,) he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon harping upon the hard-heartedneſſe and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of Profeſſors (and I wiſh that he had not ſtraw enough to make this Brick) and thoſe that are religious men, how grinding they are in bargains, how penurious, baſe, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in works of charity and mercy, how undermining and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching they are in buying, in ſelling, how having and craving in the things of this life, how hardly any work of mercy and charity comes off with them, how they let their brethren ſtarve, and dye, and periſh, rather then help them, and how bountifull, free, and liberall the very Heathens have been, and how beneficiall even Papiſts, and many that doe not ſo much as pretend to Religion, are to the poore; and therein, I confeſſe, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117294:11"/>
ſpeaks too true, but the Devill himſelf ſpake truth, to wound and deſtroy it, not to promote and propagate it; by this means he cunningly inſinuates the diſcredit and diſparagement of that, that is called Religion amongſt us, and the Profeſſors thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he might likewiſe procure the ſecond grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and deſire of his ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> the trouble, miſery, and ruine of this common-wealth, in reſpect of thoſe that now have, and formerly of late had the government thereof in their hands, he takes notice of the neglect of the Parliament in regarding, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging their friends, how they doe not at all conſider the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of thoſe that have ſtuck unto them in their ſtraights and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; how they beſtow places of profit upon the rich, and prefer themſelves, and their Children, and Kinſmen, in places of greateſt profit and advantage; how the great things that have been done for the Parliament, have been done by the meaner ſort of men, and that by helping them they are now become low and poor, and not at all regarded, &amp;c. by this meanes, he raiſeth up and increaſeth diſcontents, and ebullitions of ſpirit, heart-burnings, and repinings againſt the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, having ſomewhat heated them by the meanes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, then he inſiſts upon the unworthyneſſe of our times, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king riches and eſtates, and the things of this world, the great badge of diſtinction between man and man; the Charactariſtical token of mens fitneſſe for Government, and that it will not be well, untill ſuch time as men ſhall be eligible into places of truſt, that are vertuous and able, though poor and low in this world; and that <hi>Butchers</hi> and <hi>Coblers</hi> be choſen into the places of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and government, as well as others that are rich in this World; theſe kinds of plauſible diſcourſes are very pleaſing, and take much with diſcontented men that are poor and weak in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and withall ſhallow and injudicious; now they begin a little to ſwell, and be much conceited in, and of themſelves: this done.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he is very frequent and diligent, in fomenting the conſideration of the diſproportion and inequality of the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the things of this life. What an inequitable thing it is for one man to have thouſands, and another want bread, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117294:11"/>
that the pleaſure of God is, that all men ſhould have enough, and not that one man ſhould abound in this Worlds good, ſpending it upon his luſts, and another man of far better deſerts, not to be worth two pence, and that it is no ſuch difficulty as men make it to be, to alter the courſe of the world in this thing, and that a very few diligent and valiant ſpirits may turn the world upſide down, if they obſerve their ſeaſons, and ſhall with life and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage engage accordingly.</p>
            <p>Theſe are his Methods in ſeducing the indigent and poorer ſort of men.</p>
            <p>Again, thoſe whom he apprehends of paſſionate, cholerique, froward, and peeviſh diſpoſitions, of putting forth bold and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring language, and withall weak, ſhallow, and injudicious, and yet men that are honeſt hearted in the main, true to the intereſt of the Common-wealth, and zealous againſt tyranny and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he handles after this manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he is ever blowing up their ſpirits, by dayly diſcourſes of the preſſures, burthens, rates, and taxes, of the poor people of this Nation, Exciſe, Free Quarter, Cuſtomes, &amp;c. are the ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matter of his dayly talk.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the next thing, is the conſideration of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> hereof, and they are ſtill thoſe that are in places of Truſt and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and this is one of his moſt conſtant, certain and uniform cuſtom, to foment jealouſies againſt the moſt active, proſperous and ſucceſsful perſons of the Nation; urging, that it was ever known, that men, under pretence of zeal for Religion, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of good people, have gotten into credit, and thereby lifted up themſelves, endeavoring to deſtroy others under a pretence of Juſtice, and doing righteous things, that they may exalt themſelves, and ſet up their own faction, and promote their ſons and their daughters, their nephews and their kindred, ever blemiſhing the repute and credit of the moſt famous and deſerving men of the Times.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This done, the <hi>Remedy</hi> is to be conſidered of, and this muſt be by remove (by ſome means or other) of thoſe perſons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the cauſe of all our troubles, and miſeries, and becauſe he knows that they cannot bear the thoughts of aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What his invenctives have been againſt L. Gen. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> Comiſſarie Gen. <hi>Ireton,</hi> Coll. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> &amp;c. is notorious to all that have had intimate acquaintance with him.</p>

            <p>One of his preſumed intimate friends aſſures of the truth of

this ſtory following, (which was indeed the cauſe of his deſerting this <hi>Walwin,</hi> and ſome others, with whom he had formerly ſome familiarity, the ſtory is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there was an abſolute deſigne by ſome Agitators at <hi>Ware,</hi> to murther the Lieut: Gen: <hi>Gromwell,</hi> concluded upon, and the manner thereof agreed upon, to be thus, the Agreement then concluded upon ſhould be worn in the hats of their Party, and a ſhort Petition of about ſix lines ſhould be preſented to the Lo: Generall, Petitioning him to joyn with them, in declaring that they were the Supream Authority of this Nation; and that upon this ground, the People made the Parliament, the Parliament made the Lord Generall, and the Army, the ſeverall Regiments of the Army made the Agitators, and ſo they were the ſupream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and if the Lord Generall did refuſe to joyn with them, they were preſently to unhorſe him, reſolving to deſtroy and cut the throats of all that did oppoſe them; and that night, with a Party of Horſe, at 12 of the clock, they were to ſeize upon L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and to ſhoot him to death, adding, that he ſhould never know who hurt him; and that then they had a Charge ready fram'd againſt the King, which they would effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proſecute, and require the Parliament to joyn with them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to cut the throats of thoſe that ſhould refuſe the ſame. The ſame Party aſſures alſo, that that very night when this ſhould have been done at <hi>Ware,</hi> the private Committee did meet, with an expectation of the newes of the ſuccuſſe of this bloody pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but newes came unto them before it was expected; that the whole deſign was broken, and the manner thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> L.

            <p>The Party informing of this curſed deſign, was not a member of the private Committe, being a man (known) of more tender conſcience, then fit to be admitted into ſuch ſecreſies, but being of a more common meeting, he had the buſineſſe diſcovered unto him by another, as he is ready to aſſert.</p>

Theſe ſhall trumpet out matter of diſcontents, jealouſies, and pretended miſcariages of thoſe that are in Authority, how baſely things goe; what oppreſſions, taxations, and vexations the poor people doe endure? how this poor betraied Nation is bought and ſould? how the cutting off of ſome Tyrants doe alwaies make way for more and worſe to ſucceed them? how nothing is done for the Common-wealth? how baſely the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Kingdom is imbezeled? how Parliament men vote

monies out of the purſes of the poor ridden people into their own? how they ſhare the riches of the Nation amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? how to day they vote this Parliament man into a great Office, and to morrow another! and how they do nothing for the Common-wealth, but vote one another into places of power and profit! how that though to abuſe and caſt a miſt before the eies of the people, they make a ſelf-denying ordinance, yet ſuffer no man to put it in execution! how they promote their kindred and alies into great places every where; if any uſe be for men in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom houſe, in Exciſe-office, or in any other places of profit, this and that Parliament mans friends, or brothers, or ſons, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews muſt be the men; nay, Parliament men and their Alies have place upon place, and office upon office, as if they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall bodies to be employed at one and the ſame time? What's become of the infinite ſumms, the unconceivable treaſure of the Nation? the late Kings Cuſtoms, Ship-money, Coat, and Conduct monies, Monopolies, &amp;c. were nothing to the Cuſtoms, Exciſe, Taxations, Free quarter, Sequeſtrations, Papiſts monies, Biſhops lands, Revenues of the Crown, beſides all the Plate and Monies lent freely by the people, and yet nothing done; nay, how many for their zeale and good will to the State have lent freely and bountifully, thereby beggering and undoing themſelves, and now cannot receive one penny to buy them bread, but may lye beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, petitioning, and ſtarving at their doores, and cannot be heard? nay, it may be have nothing but courſe, hard, and cruell language from them; how one faction teares the Common-wealth and ſhare it among themſelves one while, and another, another while, neither of them regarding the eaſe or greevances of the poor people al this while, &amp; what have they done ſince this purge and that purge, they have voted the continuance of Tythes, the laying of more Taxes and Rates, they impriſon honeſt men, &amp;c. theſe and the like charges are belched out from day to day by theſe men: this is the main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> matter of their diſcourſe, writing, Printing, &amp;c. never conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how far true or falſe, what may be ſaid in anſwer to any of theſe things, but blowing and blazing theſe clamours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in all companies and places where they come, and where they can by writings, or other waies ſpread them abroad, and for this purpoſe, they have a very ſingular advantage of the good will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117294:15"/>
and affection of our weekly news-mongers, the Tueſday-Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the Fryday-Occurrances who were eaſily intreated to ſpread abroad their late Manifeſtation, that their ſimplicity, piety and innocency, and the Parliaments Oppreſſion, Cruelty and Tyrrannie might be the better known to the whole Kingdome, and Malignants hopes revived again that at laſt theſe may reſtore them. &amp;c. This raiſeth up a ſpirit of contempt, envie and malice, anger and diſcontent, againſt the Parliament, and all that they doe.</p>
            <p>For thoſe that are poor, indigent and low in the world, theſe likewiſe muſt ſpread abroad their complaints, the deadneſſe of tradeing, the dearth of the times, the great burthens, aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and taxations; Theſe are all through the neglect, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes of the Parliament, all burthens, rates and ſervices are laid upon them, they bear the heat and burthen of the day: but they are trampled upon, and is a peece of policy in men of great places, to keep the poor low, and needy in the world, and that this courſe muſt not be ſuffered &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like have been the particular ways of this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Artiſt, in abuſing ſimple-hearted honeſt men; briefly the ſeeming tendency, drift, and ſcope of all his Agitations have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the face of many fould deſigne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to root our Religion and the Principles and power thereof, out of the judgments and conſciences of thoſe that hearken unto him; witneſſe thoſe former Methods and Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces given in order thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to root out the generation of honeſt godly religious &amp; conſciencious ſort of people, when he pretends to love above others, by putting them upon ſuch waies and projects, which if they take place, would render them the moſt unſufferable genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world, not fit indeed to live in a Common-wealth: And what can his deſigne herein be, but to precipitate them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own ruine and deſtruction; and theſe are his Methods to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to propoſe ſingular good things, and very promiſing, to the Common-wealth: And indeed, either he receives his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in ſome underhand way from others, (for we are not without ground, to ſuſpect ſuch a thing, as ſhall be declared as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117294:16"/>
ſerves,) or elſe he hath a politick and crafty head in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, pretending, ordering and mannaging Propoſitions of that kind; This advanceth and magnifieth him in the thoughts and opinions of his ſeduced Diſciples, for a man of admirable &amp; good affections to the Common-wealth, to publique liberty and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good: and withall, of admirable parts, capacities, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and therefore very fit for places of government, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be liſtned and hearkned unto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the effecting of thoſe things, and bringing them to paſſe, they muſt be tendered to the Parliament by the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected in petitions; For what way is ſo meet for the people as petitioning, and what can thoſe that are in Authority do leſſe, then grant them juſt things, that every mans judgment calleth good? And here is one of the great Maſterpeeces of his craft and ſubtilty, <hi>viz.</hi> in the framing ordering and managing their Petitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Phraſe Stile and Dialect of theſe Petitions muſt be always harſh, unpleaſant, &amp; in caſe if denied, menacing and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, repreſenting the Petitioners: froward, imperious paſſionate, furious, poſitive and implacable: men of low and mean birth, breeding and quality, proud, heady, high-minded, vain-glorious giving out themſelves to be alwaies the wel-affected party, by whom, cheifly and mainly, if not onely the Parliament have bin choſen, maintained, preſerved: as if the whole burthen of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſervice of the Wars, was undergone by them, and by none elſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The matter of thoſe Petitions muſt not contain appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good things in themſelves onely, but always mingled with ſome things very doubtfull and queſtionable: cauſing many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, debates and meetings hereabout.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They muſt alwaies be clog'd and fild with ſuch things, which (though in themſelves deſireable, and (were they attained) hopeful and promiſing to the welbeeing of honeſt men, and the intereſt of the Nation: yet unſeaſonable, being of the greateſt and remoteſt probability (as things ſtand) to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: inſiſting with moſt importunities in plainneſs &amp; peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſs of words, upon ſuch things: not contenting themſelves with thoſe which are directly previous and infallibly conducing thereunto: but having a ſpecial eye, either at the preſent incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117294:16"/>
of the Houſe, (by reaſon of diverſities of judgments amongſt themſelves, the inabilties of the Nation in general, the variety of the providences of God in ordering the affairs of the Commonwealth,) to grant ſuch things, though happily they themſelves deſire it, yet with much impetuouſneſs, they commandingly pray and proudly petition for the ſame, now his game is ſtarted and he merrily purſues it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He hath divided the <hi>quondam</hi> united petitioning party, by the framing, phraſifying and ordering theſe Petitions, ſome being <hi>for,</hi> others <hi>againſt</hi> the ſame; now heat, jealouſies, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ariſe, one party cenſuring the other (with hard words) for cowardice, daſtardlineſs, and baſeneſs of ſpirit, theſe are our prudentialiſts, our wiſe, moderate men, that can never finde a ſeaſon to do good for their Country; Is it not time to ſpeak out? ſhall we always be meal-mouth'd, and never ſpeak plain? If this be not a ſeaſon? when will it be? are not the things juſt we deſire? if they will not grant them, we may ſee what to expect from them: Again, the other party looks upon them as raſh, heady, incogitant, fiery, furious ſpirited men that are like to bring all to ruine and confuſion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the houſe is hereby unwillingly precipitated and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon one of theſe inevitable rocks, either by granting their Petitions they muſt obnoxiate themſelves to the diſguſt, diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and irritation of the generality of all ſorts of the people of the Land, as alſo to the dangerous conſequences of the pride and ambition of theſe men, puft up with their vain and vapouring conceipts, that they muſt not be denyed, though their Petitions be never ſo peremptory, poſitive and commanding; or elſe,</p>
            <p>Secondly, by den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing them, they muſt undergoe the hard, uncivill and unworthy Cenſures of theſe hot ſpirited Petitioners, <hi>viz</hi> The Parliament, what is it? a company of baſe ſelf-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fellows, a pack of knaves, as reall Tyrants as the King and his Patentees, a generation that will never do good to this Nation that deſerve no better at the hands of the people, then Weezils, or Polecats, this Mr. <hi>Walwin</hi> himſelf, diſcourſing with others about modelling and framing Petitions, ſo as to induce the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament to give a gratious anſwer, profeſt to this purpoſe, that it would be better for the people, that the Parliament ſhould deny,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117294:17"/>
then grant their Petitions, for then they would diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they are, and what the people muſt expect from them; if any man ſhall reviſe all thoſe Petitions, whoſe modell was the birth of his brain, he ſhall find them ſpirited with ſuch provocations, as have the greateſt extention to all conſiderable Parties throughout the Nation; that the Magiſtrates may be provoked, their power muſt be taken away, the rigour of the Lawes abated, as inconſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whether theſe former Conſiderations do not meerly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his deſigne of miſchief to the honeſt and wel-affected party, let any mans reaſon determine; as for the intereſt of the people, the freedom and Liberties of the Nation, (the great deſire of his ſoul, and the travel of all his conceptions, if you will beleeve him) when any man ſhall ſeriouſly obſerve that the bent and natural <hi>genius</hi> of all his foli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
