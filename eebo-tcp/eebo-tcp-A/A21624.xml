            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Realme, sundrye either ignoraunt or malicious people do spreade
rumours abrode, that the base Testons of foure pence halfpenye
should not be currant after thende of Ianuary next: Hath thought
meete (leste the lyke false and sedicious rumours myght be further
spread) to do all maner her subiectes to vnderstande, that it hath
ben alwayes and so is meant by her Maiestie, that all maner the
base monyes, whiche hath ben of late decreed by Proclamacion,
sauyng the Testons of twopence farthynge, shoulde continue and
be currant styll, and so taken and payde from subiecte to subiecte, at theyr values as they be rated
by former Proclamacion, and so to continue vntyll the same maye be by her Maiesties subiectes
brought to the mynt at London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there exchaunged for newe sterlynge monyes, with thallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
to the brynger, of three pence in the pounde. Wherin suche expedicion is made, as in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of such a moment, possyble hytherto coulde be, and shalbe nowe from day to day much more.</p>
            <p>And as for the peeces of two pence farthyng, it is and was meant and declared in the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
that they shoulde be taken as currant monye vntyll the last day of Ianuary, that daye beyng
the ende of foure monethes from Michaelmas laste. And yet neuerthelesse, because within that
tyme it shalbe harde to bryng vp and make exchaunge of the same in the mynt with newe monies:
Her Maiestie is well pleased, that whosoeuer shall brynge anye of the same Testons of two pence
farthyng after the sayde last day of Ianuary to the sayde Mint at London, within the space of
three monethes after, shall haue for the same in newe syluer two pence farthyng: So as her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
meaneth, asmuch as in her shalbe, to beare herein with the burden of her poore subiectes.
And her pleasure is, that this shoulde be notified to all her louyng subiectes: geuyng also straight
commaundement, that no maner person do refuse to take in payment any of the sayd base monyes,
that is to say: the fourepence halfpeny, the threhalfpence, the threfarthynges, at the values rated
by the former Proclamation, at any tyme hereafter: neither the other base Testons of twopence
farthyng at the same rate, vntyll the last day of Ianuary. And in anye wyse to cause all persons
doyng the contrary, to be seuerely punyshed as obstinate and sedicious.</p>
            <p>And further, her Maiestie chargeth all maner of officers and ministers, diligently to see to the
attachement and punyshment of certayne lewde and sedicious persons, that from towne to towne,
and Countrey to Countrey, do cary and spreade sedicious and slaunderous tales, importynge to
simple people a feare, that Cattell vnmarked shoulde be forfeited: or that all people Chrystened or
Maryed, shoulde paye for Christenynges and Maryages certayne summes of monye to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
with suche lyke vayne and sedicious follyes, neuer meant, nor within the compasse of anye
meanyng of her Maiestie or her counsayle. The staye wherof, by speedy and seuere punyshment,
her Maiestie strayghtly requireth of all maner of Iusticiaries, as they wyll or ought to aunswere
to the contrary, &amp; from hence forth to geue order, that assone as any such lewde tale is vttered, that
the reporters therof may be eyther punyshed with speede, or els produce the aucthours.</p>
