            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Trades of the ſaid City; eſpecially in the manufacture of Serges or Perpetuanies:
as alſo the diſtreſſes of our Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Kingdome hath afforded great reliefe and
trade to theſe parts: And in their ſaid Petitions doe apprehend the grounds of all to ariſe from
the diſtractions in the City of <hi>London,</hi> which, as they humbly conceive, are occaſioned by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing
of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, and the juſt liberty of the Subject; and
by the oppoſition and hinderances which the Biſhops and Popiſh party have laid in the way of
the proceedings of your honourable Aſſembly: And doe further ſhew, that (unleſſe God by
ſome ſpeedy and timely remedy doe prevent it) this City and County are like greatly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
by reaſon of the decay of the Comerce (with its inſeparable companion Poverty)
which will, as they juſtly feare, ſtirre up many thouſand perſons to inſolent and outragious

            <p>They doe therefore earneſtly pray us to preſent the premiſſes to your Honours, with their
great feares and ſenſible apprehenſions, that the ſource of all doth ſpring from the Biſhops, the

            <p>We thought it our bounden duty humbly to preferre and preſent the ſame to your Honours
accordingly, being very ſenſible of the ſaid grievances and feares, and knowing that they cannot
but inevitably occaſion ruine and confuſion to this City and County, unleſſe God in his mercy
prevent it by your Honours wiſe and ſpeedy endeavours.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we humbly pray your Honours to take theſe our deſires &amp; humble requeſts into
your deepe conſiderations: That the true Proteſtant Religion may be ſtill preſerved, the Rights
and Priviledges of Parliament maintained, and the juſt Liberties of the Subject ſupported; and
that the Popiſh party may be diſ-armed, which (notwithſtanding the former Lawes and Orders)
have been neglected; and that the Kingdome may be put into a poſture of Defence, and the Forts
and places of ſtrength may be committed to the hands of truſty perſons; and that the power of
voting in Parliament may be taken from the Biſhops and Popiſh Lords, and alſo the ſaid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
