            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Is he forgotten that deſerved ſo well?</l>
               <l>Can you forbear the Truth of him to tell?</l>
               <l>Stones could they ſpeak, would eccho forth his Praiſe</l>
               <l>Unto the World, and how he ſpent his Dayes:</l>
               <l>He is now a Saint in Glory with the Bleſt,</l>
               <l>A Man deſerving Praiſe among the reſt;</l>

               <l>The Bleſſed Jeſus he did much adore,</l>
               <l>Admiring him in Saints that was but poor;</l>
               <l>Reproving meekly them, that when aſtray,</l>
               <l>Humbly directing them the Narrow Way</l>
               <l>That leadeth unto Everlaſting Life,</l>
               <l>A Tender Parent, Indulgent to his Wife:</l>
               <l>His Houſhold he did guide with Prudence great,</l>
               <l>A Man that never ſate in Scorners Seat;</l>
               <l>Fervent in Prayer, ſtrong in Hope and Faith,</l>
               <l>Moſt diligent in all, as Good Men ſaith,</l>
               <l>And Friend without Intereſt, or hope of Gain,</l>
               <l>A Man afflicted with anothers pain:</l>
               <l>His Heart in Heaven was, whilſt on the Earth,</l>
               <l>A Man Religious ever from his Birth:</l>
               <l>His Talent he improv'd very well,</l>
               <l>I know not any that did him excel:</l>
               <l>Two Places he did build at his own Charge,</l>
               <l>All for Gods Worſhip, <hi>Zion</hi> to inlarge.</l>
               <l>Great Cauſe have I for to lament his Death,</l>
               <l>Woe Day to me when he reſign'd his Breath:</l>
               <l>Its ſelf doth ſpeak, becauſe I have the loſs,</l>
               <l>His Death doth make me go by Weeping Croſs:</l>
               <l>But when I do conſider his great Gain,</l>
               <l>It much doth palliate my heavy Pain.</l>
               <l>Expounding Scripture, Catechiſe and Creed,</l>
               <l>Young Perſons he delighted for to feed:</l>
               <l>He's not Dead, but he is gone to ſleep</l>
               <l>I'le dry my Eyes, and will forbear to weep.</l>
               <l>Each Mourning Saint hold up your Drooping Head</l>
               <l>Dear Holy Mr. <hi>Turnor</hi> is not Dead:</l>
               <l>He's done his Work, he's gone to reſt,</l>
               <l>And we ſhall ſee him rais'd amongſt the Bleſt;</l>

               <l>For what he Preached he Practiſed with Delight,</l>
               <l>A Man moſt Sincere, Humble, and Upright:</l>
               <l>A Saint full fraught with Pious Charity,</l>
               <l>A Self-Denier of Worlds Vanity;</l>
               <l>A Spirit Meek and Courteous unto all,</l>
               <l>Supporting them that ready was to fall:</l>
               <l>The Sin of Covetouſneſs his Soul did hate,</l>
               <l>And would admit of Paſſion at no rate;</l>
               <l>Not ſlack at all in Works of Piety,</l>
               <l>He Holy lived, and Sweetly he did Die:</l>
               <l>His pains were ſharp, and hard for Fleſh to bear,</l>
               <l>But of repining he took ſpecial care:</l>
               <l>He like a Lamb ſurrendred up his Breath,</l>
               <l>And patiently ſubmitted unto Death:</l>
               <l>His Soul did long for to be fixt above</l>
               <l>For to behold the Lord which he did love.</l>
               <l>On his Death-Bed he often did expreſs</l>
               <l>His Love into the Father, yea no leſs;</l>
               <l>Praiſing of God for Bleſſed Jeſus,</l>
               <l>Who dyed on the Croſs to eaſe us:</l>
               <l>He did Adore the Father, Son, and Spirit,</l>
               <l>And now with him a Kingdom doth inherit;</l>
