            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEeting with a Paper dated at <hi>Exon</hi> the 13 inſtant, directed to <hi>W. Lenthal</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Speaker of the Parliament, and ſubſcribed by divers of my friends and relations, purporting the recalling the Members ſecluded 1648, as the beſt expedient for eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing theſe Nations upon a foundation of laſting peace. I have taken the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from my relation to ſome of you as allyed, and my affectionate reſpects to all of you as dear friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, to repreſent to your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration my preſent apprehenſions of the State of Affairs here, in order to all our

               <!-- PDF PAGE 10 -->
better ſatisfactions; wherein I humbly crave your leave of freedome without prejudice. Before theſe unhappy Wars the Government of theſe Nations was Monarchical in Church and State: theſe Wars have given birth and growth to ſeveral Intereſts both in Church and State heretofore not known, though now upon many accounts very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as the <hi>Presbyterian, Independant, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> of all ſorts as to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, and the purchaſers of the Kings, Queens, Princes, Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, and all other forfeited E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and all thoſe engaged in theſe Wars againſt the King as to civils. Theſe Intereſts again are ſo interwoven by purchaſes and inter-marriages, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forfeited; as I think upon rational grounds it may be taken for granted, That no Goverment can be either good, peacefull or laſting to theſe Nations, that doth not rationally include and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119394:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 10 -->
the ſecurity and preſervation of all the foreſaid Intereſts both Civil and Spiritual, I mean ſo far as by the word of God they are warranted to be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp; preſerved. If this be ſo, Then that Government under which we formerly were both in State and Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchy, cannot poſſibly be admitted for the future in theſe Nations, becauſe it's ſupport is taken away, and becauſe it's excluſive of all the former Intereſts both Civil and Spiritual, all of them being incompatible with Monarchical Vniformity in Church and State thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. That Government then that is moſt able to comprehend and protect all Intereſts as aforeſaid muſt needs be Republique. Wherefore to me it's no ſmall doubt, if upon the Premiſes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the Members ſecluded 1648, were not to obſtruct our peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our War, rather than eſtabliſh the one, and end the other; in that very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of thoſe Members aſſert the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Intereſt, together with the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Lawes made ſince their ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Which I fear upon accompt of ſelf-preſervation both of Life and Eſtate as well as Spiritual liberty, will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately involve all theſe Nations in moſt horrid and bloudy War afreſh; the very apprehenſions whereof, I confeſs, I do infinitely dread, and ſubmit the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence thereof to your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſiderations, and the rather, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army alſo will never endure it. Having thus briefly laid before you the preſent condition of affairs, let me now intreat you to conſider whither it were not better to deſiſt from that Paper, and ſubmit to the Proceedings of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who have reſolved to fill up their Houſe, determin their ſitting, &amp; prepare a way for future ſucceſſions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which means being full, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by comprehending the whole Intereſt of

theſe Nations, they may through Gods Mercy &amp; all our patiences eſtabliſh ſuch a Government in the way of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as may be comprehenſive of all Intereſts both Spiritual and Civil, to the glory of God and the weale and Peace of the whole. But if by your impatiencies they be obſtructed, our Peace will be ſo much the longer a ſtranger to us, and we thereby a Prey to ourſelves and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies. Wherefore humbly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe upon your ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with all the friendly and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſpects and ſervice to you all, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</p>
