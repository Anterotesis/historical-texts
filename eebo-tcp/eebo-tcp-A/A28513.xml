            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is but ignorance, if any man finde it
strange that the state of Religon (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the dayes of peace) should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
and troubled with controversies:
for as it is the condition of the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
to be ever under trialls, so it commeth
to passe that when the fiery triall of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ceaseth, there succeedeth another triall,
which as it were by contrary blastes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
doth sift and winow mens faith, and
proveth them whether they know God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
even as the other of afflictions disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
whether they love him better then
the world. Accordingly was it foretold by
Christ, saying: <hi>That in the latter times it
should bee said, Loe here, loe there is Christ;</hi>
which is to be understood, not as if the very
person of Christ should bee assumed and
counterfeited, but his authority and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
(which ought to bee truth it selfe)
that should bee chalenged and pretended.
Thus have we read and seene to bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105042:3"/>
that which followeth: <hi>Ecce in deserto, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
in penetratio:</hi> while some have sought the
truth in the conventicles and conciliables of
Heretickes and Sectaries: others in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
face and representation of the Church,
and both sorts been seduced. Were it th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
that the controversies of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were such as did divide the unity of the
Spirit, and not such as doe unswaddle her of
her bands the bands of peace) yet could it be
no occasion for any pretended Catholicke
to judge us, or for any irreligious person to
despise us: or if it be, it shall but happen to
us all as it hath used to doe; to them to bee
hardened, and to us to endure the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God. But now that our contentions
are such, as we need not so much that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Canon and sentence of Christ: <hi>Erratis
nescientes Scripturas, &amp;c.</hi> as wee need the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
of Saint <hi>Iames: Let every man bee
swift to heare, slow to speake, slow to wrath:</hi>
And that the wound is no way dangerous,
except wee poyson it with our owne reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
As the former sort of men have lesse
reason to make themselves musicke in our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105042:3"/>
cord: so I have good hope that nothing shall
displease our selves which shall bee sincerely
and modestly propounded for the appeasing
of these dissentions. For if any shall bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at this voyce: <hi>Vos estis fratres,</hi> yee
are brethren, why strive yee? hee shall give
great presumption against himselfe, that hee
is the party that doth his brother wrong.
The controversies themselves I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into, as judging that disease requireth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rest then any other cure. Thus much we
all know and confesse, that they bee not of
the highest nature: for they are not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the high mysteries of faith: such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Churches after their first peace for
many yeares, what time the heretickes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
curious questions, and made strange a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies
of the nature and person of Christ;
and the Catholicke Fathers were compelled
to follow them with all subtillity of disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and determinations, to exclude them
from their evasions, and to take them in
their owne Labyrinths; so as it is rightly
said: <hi>Illis temporibus ingeniosa res fuit esse
Christianum:</hi> In those dayes it was an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105042:4"/>
and subtile matter to bee a Christian:
Neither are they concerning the great
parts of the worship of God; of which it is
true, that <hi>Non servatur unitas in credendo, nisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eadem
adsit in colendo:</hi> There will bee kept
no unity in beleeving, except it bee intire
in worshipping: such as were the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in the East and West Churches
touching Images, and such as are many
of those which are betweene the Church
of Rome and us, as about the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sacrament, and the like. But
wee contend about Ceremonies, and things
indifferent, about the externe policie and
government of the Church: In which
kinde, if wee would but remember, that
the ancient and true bonds of unity, are
one Faith, one Baptisme, and not one Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie,
one Policie. If wee would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the league among Christians, that
is penned by our Saviour Christ <hi>(Hee that
is not against us, is with us)</hi> if wee could
but comprehend that saying, <hi>Differentia
rituum commendat unitatem doctrinae:</hi> and
that, <hi>Habet religio quae sunt aeternitatis, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105042:4"/>
quae sunt temporis:</hi> Religion hath parts
which belong to eternity, and parts which
belong to time.</p>
            <p>And if wee did but know the vertue
of silence, and slownesse to speake, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
would (of themselves) close up and
grow together. But most especially, if we
would leave the overweening and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
humours of these times, and renue
the blessed proceedings of the Apostles
and Fathers of the Primitive Church;
which was in the like and greater cases, not
to enter into assertions and positions, but to
deliver counsels and advices, we should need
no other remedy at all. <hi>Si eadem con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulis

cum non debetur <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ides affirmanti:</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if that which you set downe by way
of assertion, you would deliver by way of
advice, there were reverence due to your
counsell, where credit is not due to your
affirmation. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was content to
speake thus: <hi>Ego, non Dominus;</hi> I, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105042:5"/>
not the Lord: <hi>&amp; secundum consilium meum,</hi>
according to my counsell. But now men do
so lightly say, Not I, but the Lord; yea, and
binde it with heavie denunciations of his
judgements, to terrifie the simple, which
have not sufficiently understood out of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that <hi>the causlesse curse shall not come:</hi>
Therefore seeing the accidents are they
which breed the perill, and not the things
themselves in their owne nature, it is meet
the remedies bee applied unto them by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what it is on either part that keepeth
the wound greene, and formaliseth both
sides to a further opposition, and worketh
an indisposition in mens mindes to be reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
wherein no accusation is pretended. But
I finde in reason, that it is best built by repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of wrongs, and in example that the
speeches which have been by the wisest
men, <hi>De concordia ordinum,</hi> have not abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from reducing to memory the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
used on both parts. So as it is true
which was said, <hi>Qui paccem tractat non repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titis
conditionis: dissidit, is magis animos dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedine
pacis fallit quam aequitate componit.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105042:5"/>
And first of all, it is more then time that an
end were made of this unmodest and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
kinde of writing lately entertained,
whereby matters of religion are handled in
the stile of the stage. Indeed bitter and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
writing is not hastily to be condemned:
for men cannot contend coldly and without
affection about things they hold deare and
pretious. A politicke man may write from
his braine without touch or sense of his
heart, as in a speculation that pertaineth not
unto him; but a feeling Christian will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
in his words a character either of
zeale or love: the latter of which as I would
wish rather to be embraced, as being more
fit for the times, yet is the former warranted
also by great examples. But to leave all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
and religious compassions toward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or indignation toward faults, to turne
religion into a Comedy or Satyr, to search
and rip up wounds with a laughing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
to in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ermix Scripture and Scurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity sometime in one sentence, is a thing farre
from the devout reverence of a Christian,
and scant beseeming the honest regard of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105042:6"/>
sober man. <hi>Non est major confusio quam serii
&amp; joci:</hi> there is no greater confusion then
the confounding of jest and earnest. The
majestie of religion, and the contempt and
deformity of things ridiculous, are things as
distant as things may be. Two principall
causes have I ever knowne of Atheisme, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
controversies and prophane scoffing.
Now that these two are joyned in one, no
doubt that Sect will make no small progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And here I do much esteem the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and religion of that Bishop, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the first pamphlet of this kinde, who
remembred that a foole was to be answered,
but not by becomming like unto him, and
considered the matter hee handled, and not
the person with whom he dealt. <hi>Iob</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the majesty and gravity of a Iudge
in himselfe, saith: <hi>If I did smile, they beleeved
me not;</hi> as if he should have said: If I diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or glanced unto conceit of mirth,
yet mens mindes were so possessed with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of the action in hand, as they could
not receive it. Much more ought this to be
amongst Bishops and Divines disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105042:6"/>
holy things: and therefore as much
doe I mislike of him, who as it seemed, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself with it, as no mean policie. That
these men are to be dealt withall at their own
weapons, and pledged in their owne cup.
This (no doubt) seemed to him as profound,
as when the Cardinall counselled <hi>Iulius</hi> the
second to encounter the Councell of Nice
with the Councell of Lateran; or as lawfull
a chalenge as M. <hi>Iewell</hi> made to confute the
pretended Catholicks by the Fathers.</p>
            <p>But these things will not excuse the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of evill in another: It should contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise
be with us as <hi>Caesar</hi> said: <hi>Nil malo quam
eos similes cum sui, &amp; me mei.</hi> But now, <hi>dum de
bonis contendimus, in malis consentimus;</hi> while
we differ in good things, we resemble in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
Surely if I were asked of these men,
who were the more to bee blamed, I should
perhaps remember the proverbe, <hi>That the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
blow maketh the fray;</hi> and the saying of
an obscure fellow, <hi>Qui replicat multiplicat,</hi> he
that replieth multiplieth. But I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the question with this stutterer: <hi>Alter
principium malo dedit, alter modum abstulit:</hi> by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105042:7"/>
the one means we have a beginning, by the
other we shall have none end.</p>
            <p>And truely, as I doe marvell that some of
those preachers which do call for reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(whom I am farre from wronging, so farre
as to joyne them with these scoffers) doe not
publish some declaration, whereby they may
satisfie the world, that they dislike, their
cause should be so sollicited: so I hope assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
that my Lords of the Cleargy have
no intelligence with these other libellers; but
do altogether disallow that their dealing
should be thus defended: For though I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in him many glozes, whereby the man
would insinuate himselfe into their favour;
yet I finde too ordinary, that many pressing
&amp; fawning persons, do misconjecture of the
humours of men in authority, and many
times <hi>veneri immolant suem,</hi> they seeke to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
them with that they most dislike. For I
have great reason to satisfie my selfe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the judgement of my Lords the Bishops
in this matter, by that which was written
by one of them, whom I mentioned before
with honour. Neverthelesse, I note, there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105042:7"/>
is not an indifferent hand carried toward
these pamphlets as they deserve. For the one
sort flieth in darknesse, and the other is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
openly. Wherein I might advise that
side out of a wise writer, who hath set it
downe, that <hi>punitis ingeniis gliscit authoritas;</hi>
and indeed we ever see it falleth our, that the
forbidden writing is thought to be a certaine
sparke of truth that flieth up in the faces of
them that seeke to choke and tread it out;
whereas a booke authorized, is thought to
bee but <hi>temporis voces,</hi> the language of the
time. But in plaine truth I doe finde to my
understanding, these pamphlets as meet to
be suppressed as the others. First, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
doe seeke to deface the government of
the Church in the persons of the Bishops
and Prelates: so the other doth lead into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the exercise of religion in the persons
of sundry Preachers; so as it disgraceth the
higher matter, though in the meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Next, I finde certaine indiscreet and
dangerous amplifications, as if the civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
it selfe of this estate, had neere lost
the force of its sinewes, and were ready to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105042:8"/>
enter into some convulsion, all things being
full of faction and disorder; which is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely
acknowledged as untruly affirmed. I
know his meaning is to inforce this unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and violent impugning of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Bishops, to bee a suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
fore-runner of a more generall-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>And I grant there is a sympathy between
both the estates: but no such matter in the
civill policie as deserveth a taxation so
dishonourable. To conclude this point:
As it were to bee wished that these wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
had been abortive, and never seene
the Sunne; so the next is, that seeing they
be common abroad, that they bee censured
of all that have understanding and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as the untemperate extravagants of
some light person: yea further, they may
beware (except they meane to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all sense of religion, and to pave
their owne hearts, and to make them as
the high way) how they bee conversant
in them, and much more how they delight
themselves in that veine, but rather to turn
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105042:8"/>
their laughing into blushing, and to bee
amazed as at a short madnesse, that they
have in matters of religion, taken their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and solace. But this perchance is one
of those faults which will bee soonest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
though I perceive never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
there wants not some which
seeke to blanch and excuse it. But to
descend to a more narrow view and
consideration of the accidents and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of these controversies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
either part deserveth blame and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I finde generally in causes of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controversies,
that men do offend in some
or all of these five points:
<list>
                  <item>1. The first, the giving of occasion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
controversies, and also the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and ungrounded taking of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</item>
                  <item>2. The next is the extending and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of controversies to a more generall
opposition and contradiction then appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
at the first propounding of them, when
mens judgements are least partiall.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is the passionate and unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105042:9"/>
practises and proceedings on both
parts towards the persons each of others for
their discredit and suppression.</item>
                  <item>4. The fourth, is the courses holden and
and entertained on either side, for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the practizants to a more streight uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
within themselves, which ever importeth
a further destruction of the intire body.</item>
                  <item>5. The last, is the undue and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
propounding, publishing, and debating
of the controversies. In which point the
most palpable error hath been already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, as that which through the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and freshnesse of the abuse first offereth
it selfe to the conceits of all men.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning the occasion of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
it cannot be denied but that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in the conversation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those which have chiefe place in
the Church, have ever been principall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and motives of schismes and divisions:
For whilest the Bishops and governours of
the Church continue full of knowledge and
good workes, whilest they feed their flock
indeed, while they deale with the secular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105042:9"/>
in all liberty and resolution, according
to the majesty of their calling, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
care of soules imposed upon them; so
long the Church is situate, as it were, upon
an hill, no man maketh question of it, or
seekes to depart from it: But when these
vertues in the Fathers and Elders of the
Church have lost their light, and that they
wax wordly, lovers of themselves, and
pleasers of men: then men begin to grope
for the Church as in the darke, they bee in
doubt whether they bee the successors of the
Apostles, or of the Pharisees; yea, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they sit in <hi>Moses</hi> Chaire, yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
speake, <hi>tanquam authoritatem habentes,</hi> as
having authority, because they lost their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in the consciences of men, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
their steppes from the way which
they trace out to others; so as men have need
continually sounding in their eares, this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Nolite exire,</hi> goe not out, so ready are
they to depart from the Church upon every
voyce: And therefore it is truely noted by
one who writeth as a naturall man, that the
hypocrisie of Friers did for a great time,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105042:10"/>
maintaine and beare out the irreligion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Prelates. For this is that double
policie of the spiritual enemy, either by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
holinesse of life to authorize and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
errors, or by the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to discredit and call into question truth
and lawfull things.</p>
            <p>This concerneth my Lords the Bishops,
unto whom I am witnesse to my selfe, that
I stand affected as I ought: no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath supplanted in mee the reverence I
owe to their calling: neither hath any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
or calumnie embased my opinion
of their persons; I know some of them,
whose names are most pierced with these
accusations, to be men of great vertues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
indisposition of the time, and the
want of correspondence many wayes, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to frustrate the best indevours in the
Church. And for the rest generally, I can
condemne none, I am no judge of them that
belong to so high a master, neither have I
two witnesses: and I know it is truely said
of Fame, <hi>Pariter facta atque infecta canebat.</hi>
Their taxations arise not all from one coast:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105042:10"/>
They have indifferent enemies, and ready to
invent slander, more ready to amplifie, and
most ready to believe it, <hi>&amp; magnes mendacii
credulitas,</hi> credulity is the allurement of lies.
But if any be who have against the supreame
Bishops not a few things, but many: if any
have lost his first love, if any bee neither hot
nor cold, if any have stumbled to folly at the
threshold, in such sort that he cannot sit well
that entred ill; it is time they returne whence
they are fallen, and confirme the things
which remaine. Great is the weight of this
fault, <hi>Et eorum causa abhorrebant homines à sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificiis
Domini:</hi> and for their cause did men
abhor the worship of God. But howsoever it
be, that those have sought to defame them, &amp;
cast contempt upon them, are not to beexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
It is the precept of <hi>Salomon, That the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
be not reproched, no not in thought,</hi> but that
wee draw our conceit into a modest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of their doings. The holy Angell
would give no sentence of blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the common slanderer, but sayd, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepet
te Dominus,</hi> the Lord rebuke thee.
The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> thought against
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105042:11"/>
him that did polute sacred justice with tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
violence, hee did justly denounce the
judgement of God in saying, <hi>Percuciet te
Dominus,</hi> the Lord shall strike thee, yet in
saying, <hi>Paries dealbate,</hi> he thought he had gone
too farre, and retracted it: whereupon a
learned Father sayd: <hi>Ipsum, quam vis inane,
nomen &amp; umbram sacerdotis cogitans expavit.</hi>
The ancient Councels and Synods, as it is
noted by the Ecclesiasticall story, when they
deprived any Bishop, never recorded the
offence, but buried it in perpetuall silence.
Onely <hi>Cham</hi> purchased his fathers curse with
revealing his fathers disgrace: and yet a
much greater fault is it, to ascend from the
person to the calling, and to draw that in
question. Many good Fathers rigorously
complained of the unworthinesse of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
as if it did presently forfeit &amp; cease their
office. One sayth: <hi>Sacerdotes nominamur &amp;
non sumus,</hi> we are called Priests, and are not.
Another sayth: <hi>nisi bonum opus amplectaris E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus
esse non potes,</hi> except thou undertake
the good worke, thou canst not be a Bishop;
yet they meant nothing lesse then to move
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105042:11"/>
doubt of their calling or ordination.</p>
            <p>The second occasion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversies, is, the
nature &amp; humor of some men. The Church
never wanteth a kinde of persons that
love the salutation of <hi>Rabbi,</hi> not in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or complement, but in an inward autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which they seeke over mens mindes, in
drawing them to depend upon their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so seeke knowledge at their lippes:
these men are the true successours of <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi>
the lovers of preheminence, and not
Lord Bishops; such spirits doe light upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sort of natures which doe adhere to
these men, <hi>Quorum gloria in obsequio,</hi> stiffe
fellowes, and such as zeale marvellously for
those whom they have chosen to bee their
masters. This latter sort of men for the most
part, are men of young yeares, and superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
understanding, carried away with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
respect of persons, or with the enticing
appearance of godly names and pretences.
<hi>Pauci res ipsas sequuntur, plures nomina rerum;
plurima nomina magistrorum:</hi> few follow the
things themselves, more the names of the
things, most the names of their masters.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105042:12"/>
About these general affections are wretched
accidentall and private emulations and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments.
All which breake forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into contentions, such as either vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
truth, sobriety, or peace. These genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
apply themselves. The Vniversities are
the seates and continent of this disease,
whence it hath been, and is derived into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the realme. There some will
be no longer <hi>è numero,</hi> of the number: there
some others side themselves before they
know the right hand from the left. So as it
is truely said <hi>Transeunt ab ignorantia ad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicium:</hi>
They leap from ignorance to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
opinion, and never take a good
judgement in their way. But as it is wel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<hi>Inter juvenile judicium, &amp; senile prejudicium
omnis veritas corrumpitur:</hi> When men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and not partiall, then their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is weake and unripe, through want of
yeares; and when it groweth to strength,
and ripenesse, by that time it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled
with such a number of prejudicate
opinions, as it is made unprofitable, so as
between these two all truth is corrupted;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105042:12"/>
while the honourable names of sincerity,
and reformation, and discipline, are put
in the forward, so as contentious and evill
zeales cannot be touched, except these holy
thinges are first thought to be violated. But
howsoever they shall inferre the solicitation
for the peace of the Church: not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from carnall sinnes: yet will I ever
conclude with the Apostle <hi>Paul: Cum sit
inter vos zelus &amp; contentio, nonne carnales
estis?</hi> While there is amongst you zeale
and contention, are ye not carnall? And
howsoever they esteem the compounding of
controversies, to favour of mens wisedome
and humane policie, I thinke themselves
led with the wisedome which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
yet I say with Saint <hi>Iames, Non est
ista sapientia de sursum descendens, sed terrena,
animalis, diabolica. Ibi zelus &amp; contentio,
ibi inconstantia &amp; omne opus provum.</hi> Of
this inconstancy it is said by a learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Procedere non ad perfectionem, sed
ad permutationem.</hi> They seeke to goe
forward still, not to perfection, but to
change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105042:13"/>The third occasion of controversies, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be an extreame and unlimited dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of some former heresie or corruption
of the Church acknowledged &amp; convicted.
This was the cause that produced the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of <hi>Arrius,</hi> grounded chiefly upon dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of Gentilisme; lest the Christians
should seeme by assertion of the coequall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of our Saviour Christ to approach to
the acknowledgement of more Gods then
one. The detestation of <hi>Arrius</hi> heresie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
that of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who holding for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
the dissimilitude which <hi>Arrius</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the trinity, fled so farre from him,
that he fell into the other extreame, to deny
the distinction of persons, and to say they
were but onely names of severall offices and
dispensations; yea, most of the heresies of
the Church have sprung up of this root,
while men have made it their scale to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the bounds of their religion, taking it
by the farthest distance from the errour last
condemned. These be <hi>Posthumi haeresium filii,</hi>
heresies that arise of the ashes of other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
that are extinct and amortised. This
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105042:13"/>
manner of apprehension doth in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
possesse many of our time: they thinke
it the true touch-stone to try what is good
and holy, by measuring what is more and
lesse opposite to the institutions of the
Church of Rome, be it ceremony, be it poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
or government; yea be it other instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of greater weight, that is ever most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
which is removed most degrees from
that Church; and that is ever polluted and
blemished which participateth in any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
with it: this is a subtile and dangerous
conceit for men to entertaine, apt to delude
themselves, more apt to delude the people,
and most apt of all to calumniate their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.
This surely, but that a notorious
condemnation of that position was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, had long since brought us to
the rebaptizing of children baptized accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the pretended Catholicke religion.
For I see that which is a matter of much like
reason, which is the reordaining of Priests,
is a matter very resolutely maintained. It is
very meet that men beware how they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
by this opinion, and that they know it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105042:14"/>
is a consideration of much greater wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to be well advised: whether in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
demolition of the institutions of the
Church of Rome, there were not (as mens
actions are unperfect) some good purged
with the bad, rather then to purge the
Church as they pretend, every day anew,
which is the way to make a wound in her
bowels, as it is already begun.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last occasion of these
controversies (a thing which did also trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Church in former time) is the partiall
affectation and imitation of forraigne Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
for many of our men, during the time
of persecution, and since, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in Churches abroad, and received a
great impression of the government there
ordained, have violently sought to intrude
the same upon our Church. But I answer,
<hi>Conveniamus in eo quod convenit non in eo
quod receptum est:</hi> let us agree in this with
every Church, to doe that which is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for the estate of it selfe, and not in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
customes. Although their Churches
had received the better forme, yet many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105042:14"/>
times it is to be sought. <hi>Non quid optimum,
sed è bonis quid proximum:</hi> Not what is best,
but of good things what is next and readiest
to be had. Our Church is not now to place,
it is setled and established. It may be in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
States a republique is better then a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
yet God forbid that lawfull king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
should be tied to inovate and make
alterations: <hi>Qui mala introducit, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
Dei oppugnat revelatam in verbo: Qui
nova introducit, voluntatem Dei oppugnat
revelatam in rebus:</hi> He that bringeth in ill
customes, resisteth the will of God revealed
in his word: He that bringeth in new
things, resisteth the will of God revealed
in the things themselves. <hi>Consule providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Dei cum verbo Dei:</hi> Take counsaile
of the providence of God, as well as of his
word. Neither yet doe I admit that their
forme (although it were possible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient)
is better then ours, if some abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were taken away. The party and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
is a thing of wonderfull great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and so is an ordinary government by
Synods, which do necessarily ensue upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105042:15"/>
the other. It is hard in all causes, especially in
matters of religion, when voyces shall bee
numbred and not weighed. <hi>Equidem</hi> (saith
a wise Father) <hi>ut verè quod res est scribam,
prorsus decrevifugere omnem conventum E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscoporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
nullius enim consilii bonum exitum
unqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vidi: consilia enim non minuunt mala, sed
augent potius.</hi> To say the truth, I am utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determined never to come to any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Bishops: for I never yet saw good
end of any Councell: for Councels abate
not ill things, but rather increase them:
which is not so much to bee understood
of generall Councels, as for Synods ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
for the ordinary government of the
Church, as for deprivation of Bishops,
or such like cases, which mischiefe hath
taught us the use of Archbishops and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes,
and Primates, as the abuse of them
since hath caused men to mislike them. But
it will bee said, Looke to the fruits of
the Churches abroad and ours. To which I
say, I beseech the Lord to multiply his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
&amp; graces upon these an hundred fold.
But yet it is not good we fall a numbring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105042:15"/>
them. It may bee our peace hath made us
wanton. It may be also (though I would be
loath to derogate from the honor of those
Churches, were it not to remove scandals)
that their fruits are as torches in the darke,
which appeare greatest a farre off. I know
they may have some more strict order for
the repressing of sundry excesses. But when I
consider of the censures of some persons, as
well upon particular men as upon Churches,
I think of the saying of a Platonist, who
saith: <hi>Certe vitia irascibilis partis animae sunt
gradu praviora quam concupiscibilis tametsi oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultiora.</hi>
A matter that appeared well by the
ancient contentions of Bishops: God grant
we may contend with other Churches as the
Vine with the Olive, which of us beareth
best fruits: and not as the Brier with the
Thistle, which of us is most unprofitable.
And thus much touching the occasion of
controversies.</p>
            <p>Now briefly to set down the growth and
progression of these controversies, whereby
will be verified the wise counsell of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that the course of contention is to bee
stopped at the first, being else as the waters,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105042:16"/>
which if they get a breach, will hardly ever
be recovered. It may be remembred, how
that on their part who call for reformation,
was first propounded some dislike of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ceremonies, supposed to bee superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
some complained of dumb Ministers,
who possessed rich Benefices: some made
invectives against the idle and monasticall
continuance within the Vniversities, by
those who had livings to be resident upon,
and such like causes. Thence they went on
to condemne the government of Bishops,
as an Hierarchy remaining to us of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Romane Church, and to
except to sundry institutions, as not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
delivered from the pollutions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times. And lastly, they are advanced
to define of an onely and perpetuall forme
of policie in the Church, which (without
consideration of the possibility, or foresight
of perill, or perturbation of the Church &amp;
State) must be erected and planted by the
Magistrate. Here they stay. Others not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to keep footing on so steep a ground, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
further, that the same must bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105042:16"/>
into, and accepted by the people at
their perill, without attending the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of authoritie; and so in the mean
time they refuse to communicate with us,
reputing us to have no Church. This hath
been the progression of that side, I meane
of the generality; For I know that some
persons (being of the nature not onely to
love extremities, but to fall to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
degrees) were at the highest streame
at the first: the other part that maintaineth
the present government of the Church,
hath not kept one ten or neither. First, those
ceremonies which they pretended to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
they maintained to bee things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and opposed the examples of the good
times of the Church, to that chalenge that
was made unto them, because they were
used in the latter superstitious times: then
were they also content mildly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
many imperfections in the Church,
as Tares came up amongst the Corne,
which were not as yet according to the
wisedome of our Saviour Christ, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
strife pulled up, lest it might spoile and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105042:17"/>
supplant the good corn, but to grow on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
till the harvest. After this they grew
to a more absolute defence &amp; maintenance
of orders of the Church: and stifly to hold
that nothing was to be innovated, partly
because it needed not, and partly because it
would make a breach upon the rest.
Thence (exasperate through contention)
they are fallen to a direct condemnation of
the contrary part, as of a sect: yea and some
indiscreet persons have been bold in open
preaching to use dishonourable and deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
speech, and censure of the Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
and that so farre, as that some of
our men (as I have heard) ordained in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
parts have beene pronounced to be
no lawfull Ministers. Thus we see the
beginnings were modest, but the extreames
violent: so as there is now almost as great
a distance of either part from it selfe, as was
at the first of one from the other. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(though my meaning and scope be not
(as I said before) to enter into the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
themselves) yet I doe admonish the
maintainers of the above named discipline,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105042:17"/>
to weigh and consider seriously, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
how neer they are unto those with
whom I know they will not join. It is hard
to say that the discipline which they say
we want, is one of the Essentiall parts of
the worship of God: and not to affirme, that
the people upon perill of their salvation
without staying for the Magistrate are to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
themselves unto it. I demand if a civill
State should receive the preaching and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and exclude the sacrament of the
supper: were not men bound upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of their soules, to draw themselves to
congregations, where they might celebrate
that Ministery, and not content themselves
with that part of worship which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
hath authorised? This I speake not
to draw them into mislike of others, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a more deep consideration of themselves.
<hi>Fortasse non redeunt, quia progressuum suum
non intelligunt,</hi> Againe I say, to my Lords
the Bishops that it is heard for them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
blame in the opinion of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
person, in standing so precisely, in alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing. <hi>Leges novis legibus non
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105042:18"/>
recreate descunt,</hi> Lawes being not refreshed
with new lawes, wax sowre. <hi>Qui mala non
permutat, in bonis non perseverat,</hi> without
change of ill, a man can not continue the
good: to take away abuses, supplanteth
not good orders, but establishes them. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosa
moris retentio res turbulenta aque ac no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas
est,</hi> A contentious retaining of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
is a turbulent thing as well as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
A good husbandman is ever pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and stirring in his vineyard, or field;
not unreasonable indeed, nor unskilfully,
for he lightly ever findeth somewhat to do.
We have heard of no offers of the Bishops
of bils in Parliament, which no doubt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from them to whom it properly
appertaineth, would have every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
acceptation, their own constitutions,
and orders have reformed little. Is nothing
amisse? can any man defend the use of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
as a bare processe to lackey
up and downe, for duties and for fees, it
being the greatest judgement next unto that
generall judgement at the last day? Is there
no means to nurse and traine up Ministers?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105042:18"/>
(for the yeld of the Vniversities will not
serve, though they were never so well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned)
to traine them I say not to preach
(for that every man adventureth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to doe) but to preach soundly and
handle the Scriptures with wisedome and
judgement. I know Prophecying was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to great abuses; and would be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
now, because the lease of persecution
is encreased. But I say, the onely reason
of the abuse was, because there were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it a popular auditory, and it was
conteined with a private conference of
Ministers. Other thinges might be spoken
of. I pray God inspire the Bishops, with
a fervent love, and care of the people,
and that they may not so much urge
thinges in controversie, which all men
confesse to bee gracious, and good.
And thus much for the second part.</p>
            <p>Now as to the third part of unbrother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceeding on either part, it is directly
contrary to my purpose to amplifie wrongs,
it is enough to note and number them:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105042:19"/>
which I doe also to move compassion and
remorse on the offending side, and not to
animate chalenges and complaints on the
other. And this point (as reason is) doth
chiefly touch that side which doe most: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriae
potentiorum sunt,</hi> injuries come from
them that have the upper hand. The
wrongs of them that are oppressed, of the
government of the Church towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may hardly bee dissembled or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
they have charged them as though
they denied to pay tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
withdraw from the civill magistrate their
obedience, which they ever performed
and taught: They have sorted and coupled
them with the family of Love, whose here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
they have laboured to descry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute:
they have been swift of credit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
accusations against them from those
that have quarrelled with them. But for
speaking against sin and vice, their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and inquisitions have been streight,
swearing them to blanks &amp; generalities (not
included within the compasse of matter cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
which the party that taketh the oath
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105042:19"/>
is able to comprehend) which is a thing cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and strainable. Their urging of subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to their owne Articles, is but <hi>lacescere
&amp; irritare morbos Ecelesiae,</hi> which otherwise
would spend and crush themselves, <hi>Non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensum
quaerit, sed dissidium auget, qui quod fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis
praestatur, verbis exigit:</hi> hee seeketh not
union but division, which exacteth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that, which men are content to yeeld in
outward action. And it is true, there are
some, which (as I am perswaded) will not
easily offend by inconformity, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
make some conscience to subscribe.
For they know this note of inconstancie &amp;
defection from that which they have long
held, shall disable that good which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would do. For such is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of many, that they thinke their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
should thereby be discredited. As for
their easie silencing of them, in such great
scarcity of Preachers, is to punish the people
and not them. Ought they not (I meane the
Bishops) to keep one eye open to looke upon
the good that those men do; not to fix them
both upon the hurt that they suppose
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105042:20"/>
commeth by them. Indeed such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
and incorrigible God forbid they
should be permitted to teach. But shall every
inconsiderate word, sometimes captiously
wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched, and for the most part hardly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
be as it were a forfeiture of their voice
&amp; gift in teaching? As for particular molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
I take no pleasure to recite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
shal be troubled for saying in Baptisme,
<hi>Do you believe?</hi> or, <hi>dost thou believe?</hi> If another
shal be troubled for praying for her Majesty
without addition of her stiles, whereas the
very form of prayer in the book of <hi>Common
prayer</hi> hath <hi>(thy servant Elizabeth)</hi> and no
more. If a third shall be accused upon these
words uttered touching the controversies,
<hi>Tollatur lex &amp; fiat certamen,</hi> whereby was
meant, that the prejudice of the law remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
other reasons should be equally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of calling for mutinie and sedition: as if
he had said, Away with the Law, and try it
out by force. If these and other like parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
be true, which I have but by rumour,
and cannot affirme, it is to bee lamented
that they should labour amongst us with so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105042:20"/>
little comfort. I know restrained govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is better then remisse. And I am
of his opinion that said: <hi>Better it is to live
where nothing is lawfull, then where all things
are lawfull:</hi> I dislike that lawes bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
or disturbers unpunished. But
lawes are compared to the grape, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much pressed, yeeldeth an hard and
unwholesome wine. Of these things I may
say, <hi>Iram viri non operatur justitiam Dei:</hi> the
wrath of man worketh not the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God. As for the injuries on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, they are, <hi>Ictus vermium,</hi> as it were
headlesse arrowes, they are fity and eager in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives:
and in some fond men, uncivill
and unreverent behaviour towards their
persons. This last invention also which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
them to derision and obloquie by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
chargeth (as I am perswaded) the whole
side; neither doth that other, which is yet
more odious, practised by the most <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is calling in as it were to their aid,
certain mercenary bands, which impugned
Bishops &amp; other Ecclesiasticall dignities, to
have the spoile of their endowments and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105042:21"/>
Of this I cannot speake too hardly: It is an
intelligence between incendiaries and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the one to rob or fire the house, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to rifle it. And thus much touching
the third part.</p>
            <p>The fourth part wholly pertaineth to
them which repugne the present Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
government, who although they have
not cut themselves from the body and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church: yet they effect cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
cognisants &amp; differences, wherein they
seek to correspond amongst themselves, and
to differ from other: and it is truly said, <hi>Tam
sunt mores Schismatici, quam dogmata Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica:</hi>
There be as well Schismaticall factions
as opinions. First, they have impropered to
themselves the names of zealous, syncere, &amp;
reformed, as if all other were cold, minglers
of holy things, and prophane, and friends
of abuses. Yea to be a man endued with
great vertues, and fruitfull in good workes,
yet if he concurre not fully with them, they
terme (inderogation) a civill and morall
man, and compare him to <hi>Socrates</hi> or some
heathen Phylosopher: whereas the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105042:21"/>
of the Scripture teacheth us contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to denominate him religious accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the workes of the second table: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they of the first are often counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and practised in hypocrisie. So saith
Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that a man doth mainly boast of
loving God whom he hath not seen, if he
loveth not his neighbour whom he hath
seen. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, This is
true religion to visit the fatherlesse and
widow; and so that which is but Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall
with them, is in the phrase of the
Apostle, true religion and Christianity. As
in affection they chalenge to themselves the
said vertues of zeale, and the rest, so in
knowledge they attribute to themselves
light, and perfection. They say the Church of
England in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of her Majesties, was but in the
cradle: and that the Bishops of those daies
did somewhat for day-breake, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
and fulnesse of light proceeded from
themselves. So <hi>Sabinus</hi> Bishop of Heraclea
of Macedonia, said, that the Fathers in the
councell of Nice were but infants, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105042:22"/>
men: that the Church was not so to
persist in their decrees, as to refuse that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ripnesse of knowledge which the time
had revealed. And as they censure vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men by the names of civill and moral,
so doe they censure men truely, and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
who see the vanity of their assertion)
by the names of Politique, saying that
their wisedome is but carnall, and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of mans braine. So likewise if a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
preach with care and meditation (I
speake not of the vaine Scholasticall forme
and manner of preaching) but soundly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ordering the matter he handleth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
and draweth it downe from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorising
of it by strong proofes and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
they censure it as a forme of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
not becoming the simplicity of the
Gospel, and referre it to the reprehension
of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the intising speech
of mans wisedome. Now for their owne
manner of preaching, what is it? Surely
they exhort well, and worke compuction
of minde, and bring men vell to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Viri fratres quid age<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> us?</hi> but that is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105042:22"/>
not enough, except they resolve this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They handle matters of controversies
weakly and <hi>obiter,</hi> and as before a people
that will accept of any thing in doctrine or
manners: there is little but generality and
repetition. They move the bread of life, and
tosse it up and downe, they breake it not:
They draw not their directions downe <hi>ad
casus conscientiae,</hi> that a man may be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his particular actions whether they be
lawfull or not; neither indeed are they able
to doe it, what through want of grounded
knowledge, what through want of study
and time. It is an easie thing to call for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Sabbath day, and to speake
against unlawfull gaine: but what actions
and workes may be done upon the Sabbath
day, and in what cases; and what courses of
gaine are lawfull, and what not: to set this
downe, and to cleare so the whole matter
with good distinctions and decisions, is a
matter of great knowledge and labour, and
asketh much meditation and conversation
in the Scriptures and other helpes which
God hath provided &amp; preserved for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105042:23"/>
They carry not equall hand in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the people their lawfull liberties as well
as their restraines and prohibitions. But
they thinke a man cannot goe too farre in
keeping a commandement; they forget
that there are sinnes on the right hand as
well as on the left, and that the sword is
double edged, and cutteth on both sides, as
well the superstitious observances, as the
profane transgressions. Who doubteth but
it is as unlawfull to shut where God hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
as to open where God hath shut? to
binde where God hath loosed, and to loose
where God hath bound? Amongst men it
is as ill taken to turne backe favours, as to
disobey commandements. In this kinde of
zeale (for example) they have pronounced
generally and without difference all untruth
is unlawfull, notwithstanding that the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
have been reported to have been bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in their excuse, and <hi>Rahab</hi> is said by faith
to have concealed the spies. Farther, I heard
some Sermons of mortification, which (I
think) with very good meaning they have
preached out of their owne experience and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105042:23"/>
exercise: and things in private counsell not
unmeet, but surely no sound conceits: much
like to <hi>Parsons</hi> his Resolutions, or not so
good, rather apt to breed in men weak opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and perplexed despaires, then filiall and
true repentance which is sought. Another
point of great inconvenience and perill, is to
intice the people to heare controversies, and
all manner of doctrine: they say no part of
the counsell of God is to bee suppressed, nor
the people defrauded. So as the difference
which the Apostle maketh between milke
and strong meats, is confounded; and his
precept that the weake bee not admitted to
questions &amp; controversies, taketh no place.
But most of all it is to be suspected as a seed
of further inconvenience for manner of
handling the Scriptures: for while they seek
expresse Scripture for every thing; and that
they have in a manner deprived themselves
and the Church of a speciall helpe, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
by embracing the authority of Fathers,
they resort to naked examples, conceited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and forced allusions, such as doe
bring ruine to all certainty of Religion.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105042:24"/>
Another extremity is that excessive magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of that, which though it be a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
and holy institution, yet hath limites as
all things else have. We see (in a manner)
wheresoever they find in the Scriptures the
word spoken of, they expound it of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
They have made it almost of the
Essence of the sacrament of the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to have a sermon precedent. They
have (in manner) annihilated liturgies and
formes of divine service. As for the life of
the good Monkes and eremites of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, I know they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
a man as halfe a Papist, if he should
maintaine them as other, then prophane,
because they heard no preaching. In the
meane time, what preaching is, and who
may be said to preach, they make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
But as farre as I see every man that
speaketh in chaire is counted a preacher.
But I am assured, that not a few that call
wholly for a preaching ministerie, deserve
to be of the first themselves, that should be
expelled. These and some other errors and
misproceedings, they doe fortifie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105042:24"/>
by being so greatly addicted to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and impatient to heare contradiction
or argument. Yea I know some of them,
that would thinke it a tempting of God to
heare or read what may be said against
them. As if there could be a <hi>Quod bonum
è tenete,</hi> without an <hi>Omne probate</hi> going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
This may suffice to offer unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a view and consideration whether
they do well or no, &amp; to correct &amp; asswage
the partiallity of their followers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents.
For as for any man that shall
hereby enter into a contempt of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
it is but his owne hardnesse of
heart. I know the word of exhortation
doth chiefly rest upon these men, and they
have zeale and hate of sinne. But againe
let them take heed that it be not true which
one of their adversaries saith against them,
that they have but two small wants,
knowledge, and love. And so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the fourth part.</p>
            <p>The last point teaching the due publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
and debating of these controversies,
needeth no long speech: this strange abuse
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105042:25"/>
of Antiques and Pasquils hath been tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
before. So likewise I repent not that
which I said before, that a character of love
is more proper for debates of this nature,
then that of zeale. As for all direct and
direct glaunces or levels of mens persons,
they were ever in these cases disallowed.
Lastly, whatsoever is pretended, the people
is no meet judge or arbitrator; but rather
the moderate, quiet, and private assemblies
of the learned. <hi>Qui apud in capace loquitur
non disceptat, sed calumniatur.</hi> The Presse
&amp; Pulpit would be morefreed and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
neither promotion on the one side,
nor glory and heat on the other, ought to
continue these chalenges at the Crosse,
and such places. But rather all Preachers
especially such as are of a good temper, and
have wisedome, with conscience ought to
inculcate and beat upon a place, peace, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and sufferance. Neither let them
feare <hi>Solons</hi> law which compelled in facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
every particular person to range him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
on the one side, or the other: nor the
fond calumnie of neutrality. But let them know
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105042:25"/>
that it was true which was said by a wise
man, that neuters in contention were better
or worse, then either side.</p>
            <p>These things have I in all syncerity and
simplicity, set downe touching the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
which now trouble the Church of
England, and that without all art or insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation:
and therefore not likely to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to either part. Notwithstanding I trust
what hath been said, shall finde a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in their minde, who are not embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with partiality, and which love the
whole better then the part. Whereby I am
not out of hope that it may doe good. At
least I shall not repent my selfe of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
