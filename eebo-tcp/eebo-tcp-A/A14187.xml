            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he spreadeth, what slaunders he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth, what lyes he disperseth, and all to discredite the course of religion: the truth whereof we doe feele, and see in our owne experience: for you knowe, what enimitie the establishment of the Gospell amongst you had, by your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious foes, that would haue kept you still in palpable ignorance, with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: howe many pullbacks and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances were deuised, and be daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, to stay the course thereof, all which, for so much, as (thorough the mercie of God, to vs-ward) they haue not had that successe, which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors hoped for: they labour now, and haue done continually, to imagine slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The greatest accusation (you knowe) in generall, that your foes, the aduersaries of the Gospell, doe charge you with, is, that you professe one thing, and practise another: that you say well, and doe naughtily: that you reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d others, you your selues being worse: which (in deede) is a most hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous accusation, and such a thing, as, your owne selues can witnesse, I neuer haue winked at, but most carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, and such a thing as our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither teacheth, nor permitteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is of that force, where it entreth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it will reforme all these things (in measure) in those that haue it within them.

vnto the state, and enemie to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and gouernment: &amp; we our selues accounted malicious, proude, finding rather fault with others, than amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our selues, seeking rather for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie, than loue and charitie. You are not ignorant of the sleights of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: and therfore knowing, that he was from the beginning, an accuser, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, may the better, by the mercie of God, haue vse of your knowledge, to comfort you in these temptations. But marke, how the Lord maketh Satan, &amp; his imps, to be as spurs and pricks, to driue the godly forward, though they be very grosse, and dull in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their owne faults: (for Satan casteth a myste ouer their eyes, when they should see them) yet they be very quicke eyed, to prye into the doings of others, especially, the godly, and are able, if our foote doe but slip, to find it out, and haue it as a reason to discredit our profession, which aboue all things, we labour to keepe vnspotted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behooueth you, to looke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently


<pb facs="tcp:2224:5"/>
vnto your selues, to watch your owne soules, to attend and looke vnto euery worde that you speake, euery thought that you thinke, and euery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that you commit: to examine it diligently, by the line of Gods word, which is the touchstone, that wil either approue it, or disproue it: and if you find, by the vndoubted warrant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it is lawfull, and that you ought to doe it, then let neither slaunder, speach of people, deuill, nor hell, staye you from the practise thereof: but if, (thorough the remnants of old <hi>Adam</hi>) you be at any time allured to doe, or speake any thing, that either is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or hath no warrant from the word of God, then reason thus with your selues: this is not agreeable to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: this is contrary to that I haue learned: this will procure the name of God to be dishonoured, my religion to be defamed, and my selfe to be discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited: therefore, though it might be gainefull, delightfull, or any other way pleasure me, I may not doe it: this you

had neede to marke very well: for (I tell you) you haue many lookers on, that would laugh to see your fall: you dwell in a country, where the Gospell is very litle preached: insomuch, that your ignorant neighbours make them selues sport, to mocke at you, that will be so foolish, as to suffer your selues to be seduced by the Scriptures: you haue godlesse and profane men, that doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride you: Libertines, and freewill men, that doe despise you: worldlings and bellygods, that doe carpe at you: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that you haue very great neede to walke warily: that it standeth you vpon, to behaue your selues circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly: therefore doe thus: be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in publike hearing, and, (as it may stand with your calling) priuate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the worde of God, (for that is the onely schoolemaister, to teach you all truth) vsing daily and hartie prayer vnto God, for the presence of his holy spirite, to teach you the true meaning thereof: looke what you finde therein required of euery Christian, be carefull


<pb facs="tcp:2224:6"/>
to doe it: in your dealing with others, deale faithfully, without facing out of ill matters: without swearing, or lying: reproue others with the spirite of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that doe amisse, in your presence: shewe your selues obedient vnto all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that is appointed of God: and that for conscience sake. Bring vp your children, and seruants, in the feare of God, instructing them in the principles of religion: detract no man secretly, but tell them plainely of their faults: to conclude, shewe your selues approued vnto the Lord, in the testimonie of a good conscience, being alwaies carefull to seeke the glorie of God, and benefit of your brethren: be alwaies in worde and deede, that, which (according to the Scriptures) ye professe: and then, let Satan broach his lyes: let the wicked carry them abroad: let godlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hate you, as long as they may, it shall turne to their shame at the length, as (to our great comfort) we see it doth daily, and (being a triall of your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to your greater glorie in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

of heauen: and let not the glory of this world bewitch you, for ye are not of this world: let not the successe of godlesse persons dismay you, for the world loueth his owne, and is liberall vnto them: let not the slaunders of the wicked discourage you: for because you runne not on into the same excesse of riot with them, therefore they speake euill of you: let not the multitude of your aduersaries feare you, for God is stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then all men: let not the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of great ones daunt you, for their heartes are in the handes of the Lord, to be guided at his pleasure: let not the pronenesse of your owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seduce you, for he that liueth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, shall die: let not the crosses that accompanye the Gospell wearie you, for they bring the ioyfull fruite of righteousnesse, to all that are exercised thereby: so shall the name of God be glorified by you: so shall your foes be put to flight, &amp; your profession known to be the truth of the eternall God, that liueth for euer. Now, to come to speake

of these present sermons, which I haue dedicated chiefly vnto you: partly for that, by that calling which the Lorde hath layd vpon me, I am at this instant, bound, by all lawfull meanes, to doe you good: partly, because it is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sute of some of you, to haue them penned: &amp; partly, for that they contain in them sundrye pointes of religion, which you doe professe, and for which, you are of the world condemned: that euery man may see thereby, the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of Satan, that dare note Gods owne word with the marke of infamie: onely let me craue this at your hands, as a recompence for my trauaile, that you woulde expresse the doctrine in your liues, that I haue expressed, (though simply, yet truly) therein: that I may once see in you all that zeale, which the example of these sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds may teach you: then shal I thinke my labour well bestowed, when the beames of righteousnesse doe breake forth, as the sun at noone day: which, the Lord, for his mercie, graunt, in his

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the birth of our Lorde, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ, was made manifest vnto the shéepeherds, that were kéeping their shéepe by night, it wrought effectually (as you haue heard): first, in the Angels of God, that they were moued to praise and glorifie God, saying: glorie to God in the highe heauens, and peace in earth, &amp; towards men good will. Whereby, they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that all praise, honor, and glorie was due to God, for the work of Christs incarnation: and also made knowne the blessing of god, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was shewed vpon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind thereby: to wit, that here on earth they should féele themselues at peace in conscience, because of the full perswasion


<pb facs="tcp:2224:10"/>
of the remission of their sinnes: and also should be tyed together one to another, in a true league of spirituall vnitie: all which, floweth neither from mans will, nor desert, but onely from the frée fauour, and good will of God, our heauenlye father. Secondly, it wrought most effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in mankind, generally so many as were made partakers of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. Which parties remayne now (together with the doctrine contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the historie of them) to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of: that we may learne out of the same, such doctrine as may serue for our edification &amp; comfort: the place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore (that we may procéede ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ordinarie maner) offereth the doings of thrée sorts of people to our consideration. 1. The shéepeherds. 2. The people that heard of it. 3. Marie. In the doings of the shéepeherds, the holy ghost setteth downe their conference, their ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the place, where it was told, that Iesus was: and the fruite or euent of their iorney: In the conference, there is set downe the time when it was, and the


<pb facs="tcp:2224:11"/>
thing it selfe. The maner of their iorney is set downe to be in haste: the fruite or euent that came of it, is thréefold: first, that they found Marie, and Ioseph, and the child: secondly, published those things that they had heard: thirdly, (which is in the last verse of all) they returned, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng, and praysing God. The second sort is the multitude, that wondered at the thing. The third is Marie, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kept al these things, and pondered them in her heart. These be the braunches of the matter, conteined in this text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it came to passe, that when, &amp;c.</hi>] The first braunch, that is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, is the time when these shéepeherds conferred: to wit, presently vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Angells: that is, as soone as euer the Angells had made an ende of speaking, and were gone from them, they began to consider with themselues, that the matter was of great importance, and therefore not to be deferred: that it was a thing most necessary, and therefore not to be neglected, but further to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after. Out of which we haue to


<pb facs="tcp:2224:11"/>
learne, for our instruction, two profitable doctrines. First, that we may not linger or prolong the time, in the performance of those things, that God enioyneth vnto vs: we may not deferre the matter vntil hereafter, but presently vpon the hearing<note place="margin">VVe may not put of from day to day.</note> of his worde by his ministers, we must obey it: the reason whereof is most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant: for when God speaketh, then doth he offer the thing, whereof he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. If he threaten his iudgements for sinne, his word speaking the same, his hand is ready to powre downe the thing: if he teach vs any point of doctrine, for the confirmation of our faith, then is he ready with his spirite, to seale the same in our hearts: if he exhort vs vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, with promise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then doth he mercifully bind him selfe to the performance of the same, so that we may surely settle our faith vpon an vndoubted expectation of it: the which doctrine is notably vrged, in the epistle to the Hebrewes, out of the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 7, &amp;c. Psal. 95. 8.</note> of Dauid: to day, if ye will heare his voice, harden not your hearts. Where


<pb facs="tcp:2224:12"/>
the holy ghost doth tell vs, that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the worde of God is preached vnto vs, euen at that instant doth Almighty God offer his mercie, and maketh this vse of it, that then we should not harden our harts with contempt, or carelesse harkening therevnto, and (to imprint it the déeper in our hearts) the Lord, by the mouth of Salomon, hath vttered this<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 24.</note> fearefull threatning: because I haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (sayth he) and ye refused, I haue stretched out myne hand, &amp; none woulde regard: but ye haue despised all my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and would none of my correction, I will also laugh at your destruction, &amp;c. then shall they call vpon me, but I will not answere: they shall séeke me earely, but they shall not finde me, because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the feare of the Lord: wherevnto that of the Prophet, accordeth: beholde, the dayes<note place="margin">Amos. 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> come (sayth the Lorde God) that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of the Lord, and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the


<pb facs="tcp:2224:12"/>
north, euen vnto the east, shal they runne to and fro, to séeke the word of the Lord, and shall not finde it. We haue a moste terrible example of Gods iustice herein, in that profane person Esau, who despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> the blessing of god, in the birth right, sold it away for a portion of meate: of whome it is sayd, that he found no place to repentance, though he sought the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with teares. We sée then, both the necessitie of present imbracing Gods word with faith and amendment of life, and also the terrible threatnings that God denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth to powre vpon the heads of the contemners: the which we ought to apply most diligently vnto our selues: for if God estéeme so greatly of his word, and punisheth so sharpely the neglect thereof, we haue great cause to searche our owne consciences, how faithfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we haue yéelded therevnto: for we haue heard his word longe, we haue professed the same, and doe professe it, to the sight of the world. Nowe, if by triall we can finde, thorough the testimonie of gods spirite in our hearts, and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb facs="tcp:2224:13"/>
of our liues, that we haue not heard in vaine, but haue increased both in knowledge of the gospell, and also refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life, according to the same, our owne consciences may minister vnto vs matter of vnfeined consolation: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, if we haue long time bene hearers of the worde, and haue neither profited in knowledge of god, nor obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his lawes, surely our estate is most lamentable, howsoeuer we flatter our selues in our owne imagination: and therfore let vs search our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, whether we finde that ready mind in our selues, that we sée to be in these shéepeherds, to make present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of gods word, when we haue heard it.</p>
               <p>The second thing, that we haue to marke out of this point, is, that we sée the word of god was effectuall in them, and made them carefull to séeke further, to be informed in the matter of the birth of Christ: that they hauing the whole knowledge of the thing in euery point, might not lacke the vse of it any way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did know, that the thing both


<pb facs="tcp:2224:13"/>
being straung, and also comming from God, must néedes be most necessary for them to know. The lesson that is to be gathered out of the same, for our instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is this: that those who be truely called vnto the faith in Iesus Christ, and haue the vnfeined earnest of Gods spirit within them, doe perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that Gods word in euery point,<note place="margin">Euery point of gods word, is to be knowne of euery man.</note> is to be knowne of them, and also euery way to be practised: which is a doctrine most néedefull to be learned: for Satan hath so inueigled the hearts of a number, yea euen of them that take themselues to be gospellers, that they thinke the most part of Gods worde not to appertaine vnto them: that the knowledge thereof is néedelesse, the comfort of it fruitlesse, and the particular obedience therevnto, more precise, than necessarie: insomuch that they settle themselues in these, and such perswasions. I beléeue in Iesus Christ, &amp; hope to be saued by his bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding: I knowe that Christ died for my sinnes, and that I ought to liue wel: as for those points of doctrine, that be so


<pb facs="tcp:2224:14"/>
many, they belong to preachers, and men that professe learning, and so forth. In which kind of people you may most liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the subtiltie of Satan, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of beléefe in Christ, would ouerthrow the knowledge of God, and perswade them, that he can bring them a nearer way to heauen, than by that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, which God hath ordeined: but we are to know: that God, whose wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom shineth in the least of his creatures, hath not set downe his word to be an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thing, or belonging vnto a fewe, but vnto al, yea euen to giue vnto the simple wisedome, and sharpenes of wit, and to<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7. Prou. 1. 4.</note> the childe knowledge, and discretion. And therefore, howsoeuer they arme themselues against knowledge, and hide their hearts in the dungeon of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we must make this vse of it: that<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 12. Acts. 20. 27.</note> as God hath appointed his ministers to teach all the councell of God vnto his people: so it is his will, that his seruants should learne it all, to the ende that they may haue vse and consolation of it, in the gouernment of their liues, and


<pb facs="tcp:2224:14"/>
strengthening of their faith. If this were truely learned, it would ouerthrow that setled perswasion which Satan hath grounded in the heartes of many, whereby they thinke themselues (if they haue heard the word for some smal time) that they haue learned enough: that they haue sufficiently profited in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore they become colde, and carelesse, not regarding whether they frequent the holy exercises of religion, or no. Which is the cause (at this day) that so heynous enormities reigne in mens liues, to the great dishonor of God, and slaunder of the Gospell. But let vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues, that euery poynt of Gods word is of most weightie impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, néedefull for vs to be knowne: and that (doe what we can) we shall neuer<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12. Then we can not be too for ward, as some say.</note> knowe, but in part, neuer go farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, neither in knowledge, nor strict obedience, for still we be vnprofitable seruants: and therefore, that we with all humilitie, and reuerence, be most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in frequenting those places where we may learne to knowe more and


<pb facs="tcp:2224:15"/>
more of Gods will, and praye vnto him, that we may become euery day more godly than other, so long as we liue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They sayd one to another.</hi>] The second braunch of the first part, which contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the maner of the conference, the meaning wherof is this: that when they did sée, both the weightines of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and also the necessitie of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof in themselues, they began one to exhort and stirre vp another, to the earnest &amp; hastye séeking out of the thing. Out of which, there may be gathered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse doctrines, for our instruction. First, in that they say one to another, let vs go vp then vnto Bethleem: we may behold the beginning of the performance of that propheste: where it was foretold, that in<note place="margin">Esay 2. 3.</note> the time of Christ they should say: come, let vs goe vp to the mountaine of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord, to the house of the God of Iacob, and he will teache vs his waies, and we will walke in his pathes. Whereby the holy Ghost teacheth vs, that in the time of the<note place="margin">We ought to stirre vp one another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> Gospell, there should be such zeale, that


<pb facs="tcp:2224:15"/>
euery one should excite, and stirre vp his neighbour vnto religion: which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie being verified in these shéepeherds, doth teach vs our dutie: to wit, that if we acknowledge our selues to be of that number, whom Christ in his Gospel ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, then must we practise this point of obedience to him, and loue to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: that we be meanes to stirre them vp, to exhort, and further them in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of christianitie: wherevnto, in the doctrine of the Gospell, (which is the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute law that Christ gouerneth his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by) we are oftentimes exhorted. The holy Apostle S Paule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sayth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exhort one another, and edifie one another, euen as ye doe. And in another place: exhort one another daily, while it is called to day. And againe: let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider one another, &amp; prouoke vnto loue,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 11. Heb. 3. 13. 19.</note> and to good works. The reason whereof is this: that séeing by the mercifull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God, we are members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, wherof Iesus Christ is the head, and linked together by one spirit, the fellowe féeling of the griefe of others, (if we be


<pb facs="tcp:2224:16"/>
féeling members in déede) constraineth vs to doo good one to another: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore especially to informe those that néede, in the way of righteousnes. Thus we sée what is our dutie, required of vs by the Lord himselfe, which we are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to consider of: for we may not thinke, that the gifts of God bestowed vpon vs, are for our selues alone, but for the benefite also of others. Which, if it were rightly weyed, religion would not be so geason amongst vs as it is: for men thinke now adayes, that if they sée others wallow in ignorance, and bring forth the fruites of the same, (most enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious sinnes) in their conuersation, it is not their dutie to instruct them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (forsooth) it is the office of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: nay, they thinke the minister ought not to doe it neither, vnlesse he be in the pulpit: and therefore his documents are vnsauerie, vnlesse he himselfe be hedged in with a péece of wood on eche side: but howsoeuer they would shut out know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by these and such like spéeches: we are to learne, that it is the duetie, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb facs="tcp:2224:16"/>
of ministers publikely, but also of all men priuately, to instruct those that be ignorant, and to bring them from error: &amp; the partie informed, is not to cauil at the man that doth it, nor the place where it is done: but in reuerence to receiue it, as from the Lorde, and to laye it vp in his heart, for the amendment of his life</p>
               <p>Secondly: in that these shéepehers doe (after they haue hearde the message of God, by the Angell) thus conferre of it, howe they may be further edified: we learne that they were careful, that they shouldnot forget the things that they had heard: &amp; therfore they are earnest to goe to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the angels had named, for their further satisfaction. An example of fruitful hearers of the word of God, by whom we may learne a very profitable lesson, which is, that when we come to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hearing of the word of God. (forsomuch as we are vnfit, &amp; (in truth) vnable to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry al things away that we heare, partly thorough y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> corruption of our nature (the remnants whereof we shal alwaies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about with vs) &amp; partly thorough the


<pb facs="tcp:2224:17"/>
subtiltie of Satan, wherby he suggesteth other cogitations into our minds, to the ende that he may bereaue vs of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of Gods heauenly word &amp; steale our minds from attending to it. After that the sermon is done, we ought at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home, to méete together, &amp; say one to another: come, we haue al bene where<note place="margin">VVe must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre of the word of God, after that we haue heard it.</note> we haue heard Gods word taught, let vs confer about it, that we may not onely call to remembrance those things that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs haue caried away, but also that one may haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> benefit of the labors of others: &amp; surely it must néedes proue a very profitable way: for if one haue mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> obseruation of this or that point, an other hath marked it, so that among them they may bring away the whole, and so be edified one by another. And as all are to be careful herein, soespecialy it is to be practised by maisters, &amp; fathers of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that forsomuch as children &amp; serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be often carelesse, in attending vnto the word of God, the very feare of rebuke or correction, at their faithers or maisters hands, wil make them learne somwhat.


<pb facs="tcp:2224:17"/>
If the benefite of this course were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and the practise of it vsed (besids the commodity redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to the parties) it would be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes to stay manie hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible offences, that are committed: For what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of such idle talk that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue delight in?

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this, that so soone as they come from Church, (if yet they come there at all) they thinke their dutie to God fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and so go in all haste; to dice, cardes, bowling, tipling, and euerie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked pastime (as they call them) wherin want neither cursing, swearing, nor blaspheming, to the great dishonour of God, and procuring of his heauie wrath to be powred vpon this land, and the decay of all religion: but marke in this point the height of all iniquitie, in these out daies, whereas Magistrates should redresse these things, and others that take vppon them the correction of vice in the Church, do make a shewe of

They were (as you see) shéepheardes, men of no greate calling, and most like of small learning: yet beholde, both howe the Lord doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the birth of his Sonne, first, vnto them, and also how carefull they are, to search out euery circumstance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. There is no doubt, but if they had liued in these our dayes, they should haue bene charged with great presumption (that being men of meane vnderstanding) durst meddle with such high matters, whereof the very Rabbines could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée. But we learne by their example: 1. to admire the wonderfull wisdome, and


<pb facs="tcp:2224:19"/>
loue of God: wisdome that doth thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale his Sonne to these simple ones &amp; not to the great clarkes of the Iewes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

in their ignorance: but they will proue no better than broken réedes, and figge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues in the daie of iudgement: for God hath not placed any man in this earth, to the ende, that he (sléeping in ignoraunce) should fatte vp himselfe, with the vse of Gods blessings here, and seeke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but that he should aboue al things, be carefull to search out of Gods worde, how to know his will, that knowing it, he may obey him, and so earnestly set foorth the glorie of his holie name.</p>
               <p>Againe, we sée the maner of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings to be this: that they say, let vs go then vnto Bethlehem, and sée this thing that is come to passe, which the Lord hath shewed vnto vs, as if they should haue said: as we are careful to be further certified in this matter, so must we both be wary that we go to the place, and also search the things that haue been told vs, least we (doing otherwise) reape no benefite by our iorney: wherein wée may behold (for our example) a patterne of right obedience vnto God: they are verie forward, and yet notwithstanding


<pb facs="tcp:2224:20"/>
ty themselues vnto that which they had heard. Al men by the verie instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are desirous to knowe the trueth,<note place="margin">VVhere and how the truth is to be sought</note> but yet in the manner all naturally doe erre, for they seek it after the course that their owne fancies doe imagin: but they that wil séeke the truth truly, &amp; in truth: they that euer shal come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of the same, do follow the stricte rule of Gods worde, neither swaruing to the right hand, nor declining to the left: and they be most earnest and diligent in the same. Whereby we may make notable triall of our selues: both whether we be in the way of truth or no, and also how carefull we be to finde it.

Lastly this doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably declare vnto vs the cause that so fewe do shew forth that care in obeying


<pb facs="tcp:2224:20"/>
the Lord as they should, euen because they make so small reckoning of Gods<note place="margin">The cause that so fewe finde Christ</note> word perswading themselues that either the knowledge thereof is not néedfull at al, or if any whit, yet they goe about it as though they had no stomacke to it: but sillie soules, if they did either know the necessitie, or comfort of it, they would not estéeme it so base: the necessity: that it should be our continuall counsel, for the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our affaires: that it should<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 24. 2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> be as a lanterne to our féet &amp; light vnto our paths: that we are naturaly in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; it must be the candle to directe vs, or else we cannot choose but fall into spiritual dangers: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> comfort, that among the diuers troubles of this miserable world (the waywardnesse of our owne nature, and the manifold temptations of Sathan) it is not possible that we should stand or haue any hope of consolation but only in the promises of God, which be there set downe, whereon the soules of al holy men haue euer sed, and bene stayed: and therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> who was a kinge<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 50. 92.</note> indued with wisdome, strength, and

               <p>
                  <hi>So they came in haste</hi>]. The second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall branch of the effect is this, that when they had one stirred vp another, and being earnest in enquiring out the matter, and also knowing by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Angel, both the place where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they should go, &amp; also the thing where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of they would be certified, do now, in all haste, without anie further delay, go to the place to sée the thing, wherein wée may beholde the true worke of Gods word, that it not onelie instructeth them


<pb facs="tcp:2224:21"/>
to conferre and talke of the thing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to do it indéed. The maiestie of Gods word (as we shall sée hereafter) getteth an assent' vnto it (almost) of all men: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that all nowadaies are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to professe wel, and to make a shew: they are willing to crie, Lord, Lord, and carrie the countenaunce of Gospellers, but to bring foorth the fruit of it in their conuersation, this is the thing that they straine curtesie at: but we are to learne (by the example of these shéepherds,) that if we wil be indéed, that which we wold<note place="margin">We must not onelie professe Gods word, but do italso</note> be accompted to be, then must we be as carefull to practise Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our life, as to speake of them in our months: for religion standeth not in profession onelie: the seruice of God standeth not in wordes alone: he is not straightway a Christian, that carieth the countenaunce of one: but he onelie who is careful both of profession, and also true obedience. For as it is most true, that without professing of the Gospel we can not be the members of Christs Church héere vpon earth: so is it as true, that


<pb facs="tcp:2224:22"/>
without the fruit of that which we make shew of, we cannot perswade our selues<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9. 10. Galat. 5. 22.</note> to be (neither in déede are we) the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. For whom God teacheth by his word, he indoweth with his spirit where the spirit of God is, there be the fruites of the spirit: and the body is dead because of sinne, but the spirit is life for righteousnesse sake. Let euery one of vs (therefore) lay this vnto our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and labour to make profit of it vnto our selues.</p>
               <p>Againe we sée in these shéepheardes, that as they make the motion one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that they may goe, so they leaue not there, and so let it rest, but they goe forward also, a notable example for our instruction. When men that haue more<note place="margin">It should be so is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> ciuill honestie and moderation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues then the common sorte haue, doe méete togither often, they haue vp whole common wealthes in their talke: euer saying, this is not wel, and that mighte be amended: &amp; it were wel if such a thing were so: but you shal neuer heare more: They content themselues with (it should

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation of man: and therefore you here prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may haue good vse of this doctrine when you haue anie publique matters in hand: especially when you do méete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,

for the election of your Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, I am sure you will all saie and wish in generall termes, that a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent man may haue this and that office: but surely it falleth out, that euerie man almost is led by his priuate affection, in the particular wishing either the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and benefite of him selfe, or his friend, neuer regarding how able hée is to discharge it. And hence it is that (as Salomon saith) we may sée a great euil vnder the sunne, as an errour that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth from the face of him that ruleth:<note place="margin">Ecclesiast. 10. 5</note> follie is set in great excellencie, and the rich (in al manner of wisedom) set in the law place. I haue séene seruants on hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Princes walking as seruants on the ground: wherevpon foloweth all disorder, because the gouernours either can not, or dare not, or wil not execute their office aright.</p>
               <p>We may moreouer sée in these shéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds a note of great zeale, that their mindes being rauished with desire of the thing, they went in haste: striuing (as it were) to go one before an other: and


<pb facs="tcp:2224:23"/>
they had great reason for it: for being taught that the sonne of God, the saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of mankinde, their redéemer, was to be séene in Bethlehem: who can blame them, if they ran one ouer an other for hast? Which teacheth vs what we are to do in matters of religion. Forsomuch as in the worde of God, we séeke the same Christ, yea, farre more glorious than he was, when they sought him: we are to contend with all possible indeuor, that we may eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go before our teachers, that (as Dauid did) we may excel them, in wisedome, zeale, vnderstanding, and godlines: But do we so? Alas, no, we are maruellous manerly herein: we giue place to euerie one to go before vs, and<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 98.

And thus we builde vpon men, forgetting the rocke Iesus Christ, vpon whom we should settle our ground, and of whome we must learne both knowledge, and example of life: but in our worldlye matters (which<note place="margin">Math 7. 2. 4. 11. 29. 16. 24.</note> should be meanes to induce vs to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whereby we doe euen condemne our selues to be méere worldlinges, wholly addicted to the mucke of this worlde, not caring what become of all our dearest friendes, yea of our owne soules after this life, so that we may haue present gaine.

O that we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the excellencie of the soule aboue the body: and thereby compare the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes of the one with the other, and the necessitie of the one beyond the other: then (doubtlesse) would our righteousnes burst foorth as the starres, and our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as the sun at mid-daie: then should not wée poore preachers of Gods worde, crie out so much as we do, for religion and reformation, with so small profite: then should not Christ be turned behind <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

The world now adaies is ful of people that be right of the same disposition, for let them come to the Church where they heare Gods word preached, you shall sée them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently so attentiue as though they would catch the doctrine before it be vttered: sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming so to depend vpon the mouth of the minister, that they thirst for the doctrine before it come, and also departing from thence, you shal heare them with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>them in her heart</hi>] This is the third parte, wherein the birth of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed by the Angell is effectuall, shée was the mother of the childe, and did knowe that hée was wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and therefore was perswaded, that God had a marueilous worke to do by him: And séeing first the Aungell comming to her, and then the shéepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, was further induced to muze of the matter, and therefore she did as is here expressed: First, she kept them, secondly, she pondred them in her heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kept all those things</hi>) The first: the originall word is, that she kept them all togither as it were in one bundle, both the Angels speach and the shéepeheards comming to hir, and euery other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the maner of her sons incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and birth, wherein she sheweth her selfe obedient euerie way vnto the word of God, so often as she heard it: for the Angell Gabriel had told her this matter before hand, and nowe she hearing the same from the shéepeherds, laieth it then also vp in her hart. If she had béen of the

minde that manie be in these our daies,<note place="margin">The sayings of the wicked when they heare one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine twice.</note> and yet take them selues to be good Christians, shée woulde haue saide vnto the shéepeheards: Why do I heare this from you?

Why then shoulde I giue eare vnto it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine especially being spoken by you, that be but inferiour persons, of no reputation? So saie manie among vs, if they heare one doctrine twice, they thinke it not worthie the hearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, because they thinke they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ynough at the first: but if it be the second time by a meaner Minister than at the first, they abhorre it so much the more, saying: I heard this hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a learneder man than hée is, by Maister Doctour, by Maister Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, &amp;c. I am sure he can saye no more in it (nor so much) as hée did, therefore I will be gone. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was not of this minde: for shée considered, that the shéepeheards could not come to the knowledge of the thing, without the will of God: and that the


<pb facs="tcp:2224:37"/>
Lord who guideth all things, had dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them to come thither, and therefore it was méete forher to harken diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and marke euerie word verie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely.

Therefore I must make this vse (rather) of it, reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with my selfe thus: I thinke that I know this point that is now in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling well ynough: but yet I am decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for God woulde not then haue it spoken to me againe, therfore I am now to heare it as diligently and marke it as carefully, as though I had neuer known <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>And pondered them in her heart</hi>) The second thing that Marie did, they beeing kept in the chest of her heart, it is saide moreouer, that she pondered them, that is, called them often to her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and was alwaies muzing of them. Wherein wée may beholde an


<pb facs="tcp:2224:38"/>
example of most Christian modestie, that hauing so great matters reuealed vnto her, she maketh no bragge of it, as<note place="margin">VVe may not boast of know ledge or any other vertue.</note> though she were to be honoured of all men and admired for it, but is rather carefull to make vse of it vnto her selfe. By whose example is corrected that proud spirite of worldlings, who, albeit they neither knowe one point of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aright, nor yet can tell how to begin the practise of a godlie life: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">They bragge most that know least.</note> they wil oppose them selues, both in knowledge against the learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and in godlinesse against the most holie, whose helpe (in déede) Sathan vseth to out face the true seruants of the Lord with their bragges: and to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of their power, to bring them into hatred and contempt. But Marie was not of that minde, she was inspired with that spirite which teacheth true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which instructeth the godlie to be lowlie in their owne conceit, and<note place="margin">The godlier that a man is, the humbler he will be.</note> humble in their owne imaginations, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth bring them to the sight of their manifold sinnes, and the desert of


<pb facs="tcp:2224:39"/>
the same: wherby they are brought low and taught to depend vppon the méere mercie of God, to boast in nothing, but their owne infirmities: to desire to knowe nothing but Iesus Christ, and<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 30.</note> him crucified.</p>
               <p>Againe wée are to obserue, that shée therefore pondered them in her heart, because shée did not yet beholde what would be the euent of these things: and yet shée would not neglect them. By whose example we may learne a profi-table lesson, to teach vs how to vse the doctrine that wée learne from the Lords messengers. It may be, that at that<note place="margin">The right vse of knowledge.</note> present time when we heare it, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tel how to haue the present vse of it, as they that be certainely perswaded of Gods fauour to them, haue not present or so great néede of the comforts against distrustfulnesse, they that be sufficiently humbled, néede not greatly the seuere reprehensions of the Law: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, when they heare the doctrine, they are not straightway to thinke they néed not harken vnto it, but rather they


<pb facs="tcp:2224:39"/>
ponder it in their heart, and lay it vp there as in a store house. We may learne this lesson by the example of a good hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,<note place="margin">VVe must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoore vs in knowledge.</note> who finding anie implement in his house, which he presently knoweth not how to bestow, wil saie, I wil keep it seauen yeares, and once in that time I shall haue vse of it: euen so it fareth with Christians, they are to prouide for warre in the time of peace: to arme them selues as wel where Sathan stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not, as where he doth strike, and to be furnished with the complete armor of God, to be instructed with doctrine euerie waie, that wheresoeuer, or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he shall assaile vs, his blowes may be warded, and kept backe with the sword of the spirit which is the word of God, for we are not worthy to be so much of Gods counsell, as to know with what trial he wil search vs next, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to be euerie way prouided, persecution, sicknesse, pouertie, and all other Crosses that we are subiect vnto, come very sodenly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it wil be too late, than to séeke armour of proofe for our

                  <hi>And the sheepherds returned glorifying and praising God, for all that they had heard and seene, as it was spoken vnto them</hi>) This is the third and last effect that is sette downe vnto vs to be wrought in the shéepeheards, by the knowledge of the birth of Christ: which containeth in it three things: first, their returning: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, their glorifying, and praysing of God: third, the cause wherefore, for al that they had heard and seen as it was shewed vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sheepeheards returned</hi>) The first thing (as you sée) is, that when they had séene, and were fully instructed in the birth of Iesus Christ they returned back againe from Bethlem vnto the place of their former abode, to exercise the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their ordinary vocation: wherein we may beholde in what place they set the workes of their calling, euen in the


<pb facs="tcp:2224:40"/>
last place of al: for we sée, that they first went in haste to the place where Christ was to be séene, then published it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade tothe worlde, and lastly, when they had done, they returned: wée are to learne then (if we mean to profit by their<note place="margin">The world ought to giue place to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> example) to preferre the knowledge of Iesus Christ, and the spreading abroad of his will, whereby he may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before our owne matters of this<note place="margin">Prou. 16. 4.</note> world. For the first end of our creation is Gods glorie, and the second, our own saluation, wherevnto in their seuerall places the businesses of this world must attend and giue place, that is, that no things that be in, or vppon this earth, should be anie hinderaunces vnto vs for the setting foorth of Gods glorie, and the séeking of our owne saluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that is sooner taught than it is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and sooner spoken than practised: for howe fewe are there to be found in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worlde that doe kéepe their worldlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires so farre vnder, that they be wholly eaten vppe with the glorie of the Lorde? And howe manie are there euerie where


<pb facs="tcp:2224:41"/>
that do place this world in equall degrée with religion, yea and suffer it (beeing of it self an vnderling, the things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God hath put vnder mans feet) to be so saucie as to be check-mate with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yea and to checke (often times) and to controll the very motions of the spirit of God? But of all other, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a thing is it to find euery where those persons that do entertaine this present world as a Quéene, giuing vnto him the whole rule and gouernement of their hearts and minds, and turning religion cleane out at the doores, do bid her fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and set her to begging. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon, she hauing so long offered herselfe vnto this land, and finding so base inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, shée is at this present almost banished out of it, so that a man may séeke whole houses, and not finde her, townes and countries, and yet her face is founde scarce to appeare. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the worlde despiseth her (being that wisedome of God spoken of by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, that crieth in the stréets) we are to preferre her before golde and siluer,


<pb facs="tcp:2224:41"/>
before delights and pleasures, we are to<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 20.</note> make it the finall end of all our deuises, and counsels, to procure him vnto vs, who onely teacheth the seruice of God, and openeth the way to eternall life. And not to doe, as is the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who, when they be exhorted to make religion their chiefest care, and not to wed them selues thus to the world, wil answere (their owne consciences telling them that it should be so) indéed I confes<note place="margin">The excuses of worldlings why they be not religious.</note> I am too blame to be so negligent, but to say the truth, I could not as yet do as I would, for I haue had so many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in hand as I could possibly turne my selfe vnto, which are indifferent wel ouergone now: so that if I had once done with one or two businesses moe, or, if I had such and such a commoditie that I am about, then you shall sée me be at an other stay. Thus doe these persons think that they do answere wislly, &amp; yet euen in such spéeches they declare, that when they haue serued the worlde, then wil they serue God: (for they shal neuer want such excuses so long as they liue)


<pb facs="tcp:2224:42"/>
when they haue nothing else to doe, they will be religious: in effect, when sinne for saketh them<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, then will they forsake it: But God looketh for the first fruites for the prime of all our labours, he will be serued before and aboue al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and therefore let vs not thinke to deale with him so: let vs not deceiue (or flatter our selues) thus: but let vs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the example of Dauid, dedicate al<note place="margin">Psalm. 10 3. 1</note> that is within vs, to the praise of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie name, and that from our youth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so shall we be sure of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God in this life, and in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Let vs yet obserue further the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of these shéepeherds, who (though they were verie zealous and forward) yet you sée, that in his due place they had also a dutifull care of their calling, not béeing so farre carried awaie from their shéepe, that they vtterly forgotte them: but it is reported of them héere, (and allowed by the spirite of God) that they returned, to wit, to their charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: by whose example wée do learne


<pb facs="tcp:2224:42"/>
this lesson, that religion (euen in the perfection thereof) doeth not abolish the ordinarie calling of this world, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt any man from taking some law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full waie or other for the maintenaunce of him selfe and his familie. For God hauing placed man in this world, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dourned it with the wonderful riches of his creatures, and made them all for the vse of man, permitteth vnto him (recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them as from him with thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vsing them for his necessitie, and comfort) the frée vse and benefite of this world, and al the things contained in the same: yea rather religion is so far from hindering or exempting a man from his calling, that it is the onelie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for man, both to choose vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe such a calling as is lawfull: and also (hauing admitted himselfe therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) to employ him selfe in the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and to vse it lawfully: the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plentifull for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the proofe of this point. Let vs consider of certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the warrant of this doctrine. But we beseech you (brethren) that ye increase<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 10. 11</note>


                  <pb facs="tcp:2224:43"/>
more and more, and that ye studie to be quiet, and to medle with your owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and to worke with your owne hands as we commaunded you, and in<note place="margin">2.

Iohn the Baptist teaching the people the right fruites of<note place="margin">1.

of by seruants that professe religion: for it is a common complaint (the trueth whereof I referre vnto euerie mannes conscience) that if once they become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, they waxe more carelesse in their Maisters businesse, which if they do, it is a greeuous sinne in them, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teacheth them no such matter, neither giueth them anie such leaue, but rather cleane contrarie, for Saint Paul enioineth vnto seruants, that they<note place="margin">Coll. 3. 22.</note> should be obedient vnto them that are their Maisters according to the flesh in all things, not with eie seruice as men pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God: and bringeth a reason (in an other place) to perswade them therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: to wit, that whatsoeuer good thing<note place="margin">Ephes. 68.</note> any man doth, that same shal he receiue of the Lord, whether he be bond or frée, and saith further in an other place, that else they make the name of God and his<note place="margin">1.

is not religious indéede, but abuseth the name of religion, to couer his owne sinnes. For this is most true, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the onelie thing that maketh seruauntes haue a conscience to looke to their Maisters gaines, and therfore they<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> that would haue profitable seruants let them not onelie be carefull to retaine such as they know to feare God, but also<note place="margin">Psal. 101. 6.</note> that they instruct them dailie in the feare of the Lord, teaching them to do euerie thing by knowledge out of the word and conscience of obedience vnto God. The second sort of people that by this doctrine<note place="margin">The second sort of people.</note> are iustly reprooued, be the Anabaptiste, and their Cousingermanes the family of Loue, (of Lust I may terme them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) who (mistaking that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Actes of the Apostles where<note place="margin">Acts 2. 44.</note> it is said, that they that were conuerted vnto Christ, had all things common) do holde, that no man hath anie proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in any thing that he possesseth, but that euerie brother hath as lawfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it, and may vse it when he will, as the partie him selfe, and though the


<pb facs="tcp:2224:45"/>
words of the text at the first blush séeme to import so much: yet being duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered they containe no such matter, for the verse following doth shewe the meaning of the former where it is saide, that they sold their possessions, and parted to euerie one as they had need, that is, they had such a zeale and loue vnto the brethren, that they did reléeue and helpe them. But if it should be so taken, it were manifest contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to other places of the Scriptures (which were great blasphemie to think that any parte of Gods worde shoulde be contrarie to an other) for trueth is one, and alwaies like it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and nothing commeth from God, but it is all truth, and nothing but truth. Nowe in the Scriptures we reade, that God hath set downe lawes to gouerne men buying and selling, that euery one shold deale iustly therein, and that none shold defraud an other by false waights, or measure, or counterfaite wares, which were a néedelesse doctrine, if men had no propertie in things, for then why should


<pb facs="tcp:2224:45"/>
they sell? Or what néeded the other to buy? Besides that, the Scripture is plentiful in this, to exhort rich men vnto liberalitie and pitie in reléeuing their néedie brethren, and neuer enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto anie, to accompt nothing his owne.

               <p>Againe, though these Shéepeheards shewed themselues maruelous forward, yet you sée, that after they had found that they did desire, they had their flockes to returne to againe, wherein we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great loue of God vnto them, that in those daungerous times their flocks were preserued vnto them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wée may learne this generall lesson, that religion rightly vsed is no enimy to<note place="margin">Religion no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gaine.</note> lawful gaine: neither of it selfe doeth it bring vnto man any hindraunce: a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that will hardly sincke into the heads of a number, for they perswade themselues, that nothing is more eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to worldly gaine than religion,


<pb facs="tcp:2224:49"/>
whom I do briefly answere thus, that if they meane euerie kinde of gaine which way soeuer it be come by, without regard whether it be had by right or wrong, they say truly, that religion is the onely foe (next vnder God) that it hath: and as for such, it is but lost labour to tell them of anie religion, for the feare of God is not before their eies: but if they meane that gaine which may lawfully be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the warrant of Gods worde, no point of religion can be against it, for the Lorde (as you haue heard) enioineth such a course to gaine vnto euerie one of his children: whereby it is proued law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and for the fruit of their labour the Lord hath promised that he shal reape it. First séeke the kingdome of God and his<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> righteousnesse, and al these things shalbe ministred vnto you. Where you sée, that God hath promised his blessing euen in this life to them that be truly religious. But you wil say to me, how is that tru? For we sée in experience the godlie man commeth vnto many extremities. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that religion was neuer the cause


<pb facs="tcp:2224:49"/>
of any of them: for you must vnderstand, that God neuer punisheth, but either to correct, to trie, or else to giue example: one whereof is the cause of euerie affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therfore let no man say, if I had not béene a Gospeller, this had not befallen vnto me, or religion is the cause of this miserie. For if he will truly enter into the consideration of the thing by the word of God, he shal find, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afflicteth any man because he is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, contrariwise, wée reade and sée daily by our owne experience, that God seuerely plagueth the lacke or contempt of religion euen in worldly matters, for you shal see some that are so vigilant and careful about their earthly commodities, that they can not affoord themselues any time to refresh their weary bodies with sléepe and food, nor the Lord anie part of his Sabaoths to be duly honored in, that a man woulde thinke they can not choose but prooue marueilous rich, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they are neuer the néerer: &amp; why? surely, because they not hauing that care of gods seruice that they shold,


<pb facs="tcp:2224:50"/>
nor that regard to depend vpon his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that God requireth, but thinke to bring greate matters to passe by their owne industrie, and (as it were) in despite of the Lord: he of his iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laieth such a curse vppon their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that they profite nothing at all: whereby such persons may haue iust occasion to learne, that man liueth not<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 4.</note> by bread onely: For the Lord can break the staffe of bread, that is, the strength<note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 26.</note> thereof, that it shall not nourish: and can frustrate the hope of the labourer, that he shall not reape the fruit of his owne works. And therefore we are first to séeke his glorie, and then in all our trauailes to acknowlege them to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to yéelde vs any comfort without his gratious blessing be vpon the same.</p>

                  <hi>Glorifying and praising God</hi>] The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of this last branch, is, that they did in and after their returne glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and praise the Lord. Wherein they shewed them selues not to be forgetfull or vnthankefull of Gods mercie toward them, by whose example we may learne


<pb facs="tcp:2224:50"/>
what duetie we owe vnto the Lorde our God in respect of his manifold blessings, that we must glorifie his holy name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for them: which lesson we had verie much néede to obserue and folowe: for it is the course of the worlde now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies to be thankefull vnto God, as they are to men, with a worde and away, neuer remembring him any more: But we are to know, that God will not be so serued: he requireth continuall and heartie thankes at our handes: which, if we would rightly consider, we shoulde not generally be so secure as we be. For time (which should teach vs experience of the loue of God towardes vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so make vs more zealous) doeth cleane weare out of our mindes the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of former benefites receiued, so that you shall sée them that by special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor that they haue found at Gods hands, are (for a season) excéeding hote and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in religion: But it is with them according to the common Prouerb, soone hote, soone colde, for they become after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward so faint and cold in their course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne,


<pb facs="tcp:2224:51"/>
that it may be truly said of them, as it was of the Church Ephesus, that haue fallen from their first loue. I wold to God, that I had not iuste cause to make this complaint in this place, for surely (to speake generally) I haue séene more zeale, more loue and care vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than nowe I can beholde: the world doth so carie men awaie, and they be so crammed with the word, that now they be ready to surfet of it: they be cloied with it, &amp; séeme to loath it, as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Manna: but assure<note place="margin">Reuel. 3. 4.</note> your selues, that if the plentie thereof do make you estéeme it lesse precious, God will send you that darth &amp; famine that he threatneth by the Prophet, that yée shall séeke it from sea to sea, and not finde it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, in that these are saide to haue this wroght in them by the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the thing, that they glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Amos 8. 11.</note> and praised God, we learne, that where religion is truly imbraced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the word of God taketh root &amp; true holde, it wil bring foorth the fruit conuenient &amp; agréeable to the same: for of it selfe it is

a most liuely séede, &amp; is mightie in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so when it méeteth with a heart that is pliant therevnto, it is verie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and therefore let no man flatter &amp; deceiue himself by perswading his own hart, that he is truly religious, when in the meane while he is cold and carelesse in the fruits of it: for Gods spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth religion, which is a spirite of heate and zeale making mans heart (as it were) to melt at those things y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are for the glorie of God, &amp; encrease of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the harts of Gods people, which ought to be farre more glittering in vs, than it was in the shéepeheards, for wée haue greater cause: the whole passion, death, &amp; glorificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vnto vs, so that we lacke nothing to perfect our knowlege (if we will receiue it) &amp; therfore there must be no lingering in vs, to shew forth al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> praises of god in most perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we do litle regard.</p>

also learne it by these shéepeheards, that they did it as it was tolde them, that is, according as God had commaunded: so must we do, praise his holie name, (as he requireth at our hands) and doe it as himselfe hath commaunded in his word, and so shall it be acceptable in his sight: Let vs therefore (to conclude) séeing we be hedged in on euerie side with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great blessings of God, séeing that by him wée liue and moue, and haue our being, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he sheweth himselfe most kinde and liberall, both in things that concerne the soule and the bodie: let vs (I say) stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and indeuour by all possible meanes, that so long as we abide in this transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie world, we may shew foorth the glorie of his name according to his will: then shal we be sure of his fauour vnto vs in this life, and of eternall ioies in the world to come, by the merites and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheding of Iesus Christ our sauiour: to whome with the father and the holie ghost, be all glorie and honour, now and for euer.</p>
