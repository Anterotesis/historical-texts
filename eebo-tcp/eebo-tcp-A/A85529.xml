         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Suffers bleeding <hi>Ireland,</hi> which makes our Kings heart bleed, ſtill to wallow, and welter in bloud, without ſtenching that bloudy iſſue? Who ſo periſh through want of our timely compaſſionate remedy, their bloud, (I feare me) will be put on our accompts againſt the reckoning day of the Doome finall. Can our <hi>prayers</hi> worke our deliverance, our eares and hearts rejecting the ſuites of bleeding Proteſtants, or not ſeaſonably relieving their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſperate condition, and humanely forlorne hopes? The ſentence is peremptory, <hi>Prov. 21. 13. Who ſo ſtoppeth his eares at the cry of the poore, hee alſo ſhall cry himſelfe, and ſhall not be heard.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull</hi> (evermore bleſſed) <hi>for they ſhall obtaine mercy, Matth.</hi> 5. 7. Nothing ſo ſure as their deliverance out of what ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, dangers, cares, feares.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, <hi>Prayer</hi> it is that obligeth to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in hearing Gods Word, and uſing aright the Sacraments of his Ordination. For how thinke we that God will regard our prayers, if we bee overly in the obſervation of his ſerious enjoyments? will he receive our demands, if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>light over his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? if wee waite not conſtantly in his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156560:12"/>
on his ſacred beheſts and appointments?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Prayer</hi> doth bind us all to the good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, one towards another, nay more to the Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of enterchangeable Reconciliation in the occurrences of what ever differences and offences. That paſſage is full and faire, <hi>Matth. 5. 23, 24. If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the Altar, and goe thy way; firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> If wee ſerve not one another in love, which is an enjoyment Apoſtolicall, neither our perſons, nor our prayers can pleaſe God. When our Saviour had preſcribed us a forme of Prayer he reaſſumeth and reinforceth that Petition in it, <hi>Forgive us our debts as wee forgive our debtors,</hi> for, ſaith he, <hi>If ye forgive men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you, but if yee forgive not men their treſpaſſes; Neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes, Matth.</hi> 6. 14, 15. We have it thus related by Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> chap. 1. verſe 25. 26. <hi>When yee ſtand praying, forgive if yee have ought againſt any, that your Father alſo which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> Hold we to this, and we ſhall be happy in deliverances; but if thus cordially and really we pecce not up, in peeces ſhall we be like a Potters veſſell graceleſſe, uſeleſſe, in all troubles remedileſſe, which God avert, and bring us all into the right tune and temper of Chriſtianity, and regular charity.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:156560:13"/>We are never right till God ingenuouſly bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by us, to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the remover of evills, and of whatſoever is good the gratious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtower. What we do muſt all be done to the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. To this end were all things made, in all creatures God ſets forth his <hi>glory,</hi> and in them all will he be <hi>glorified;</hi> light cannot be hid, and God of lights is the Father, and in them all is repreſented; to be <hi>glorified</hi> by Men, the Sonne of God became man; he is God manifeſted in the fleſh, and for that manifeſtation never can we men <hi>glorifie</hi> our God enough. By this hath God made his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome manifeſt in finding out a way to ſatisfie his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice exactly, without the leaſt prejudice at all to his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Nay, His Mercy is moſt evident in his Juſtice, his Sonnes death on the Croſſe was the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the purchaſe of Heaven for us who had merited hell by the heinouſneſſe of our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. To be <hi>glorified</hi> will God againe ſend his Sonne, and in our nature too, but <hi>glorified.</hi> To bee judged and to death ſentenced for our offences was his firſt comming; to bee the viſible Judge both of quicke and dead ſhall his ſecond comming be. To be <hi>glorified,</hi> God ſets up, and takes downe whom hee pleaſeth, Kings and Kingdomes are at his diſpoſall; to the Kings of the earth is hee terrible (writes the Pſalmiſt) <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 76. 12. And the Courtly Prophet is plaine; <hi>The Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh; yea thoſe Nations utterly ſhall be waſted Eſay</hi> 60. 12. To be <hi>glorified,</hi> God remarkeably puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth his owne tranſgreſſing people, and at his owne houſe many times begins his judgement, but ends in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:156560:13"/>
The ruine of his enemies. Wee ſee that in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and to the height at laſt ſhall it be made full; <hi>As truely as I live all the earth ſhall bee filled with the glory of the Lord, Num.</hi> 14. 21. Yet thinke not here, beloved, that God ſtands in need of being <hi>glorified</hi> by men, or felt in himſelfe a titillation from men; No, no, before we were, before the world was, <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> was he above our thoughts. Stood hee in need of <hi>Glory,</hi> the Angels are abler, and readyer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll him then all the whole race of Mortalls poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can.</p>
            <p>As we are leſſe than the very leaſt of all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo his prayſes are to him an abatement, to us onely an advancement; our very thankſgivings are beggings, and our owne Intereſt and improvements in his various bleſſings, the foundation of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting his Name. It is a moſt Gratious vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement of our God that hee will by us bee <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might expatiate here, but my weake and ſpent lungs preſſe me to abreviate, and to contract much, which I purpoſed largely to have diſcourſed of into a narrow compaſſe of time. Thus then wee are to <hi>glorifie</hi> God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by ſpeaking of his ſupreme Majeſtie with all due ſubmiſſiveneſſe and reverence; All collogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, all diſſemblings, all hypocriſies muſt here bee farre, farre from us; this, this it is to give <hi>glory</hi> unto God, to ſpeake the truth though it be againſt a mans ſelfe: <hi>Give God the glory,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> to <hi>Achan.</hi>) That giving of <hi>glory</hi> was the open confeſſion of his cloſe ſinne, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. 19. It is the acknowledgement that of all hearts God is the ſearcher, and the juſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156560:14"/>
avenger of wickedneſſe, though never ſo palliated. We muſt not ſhrinke from confeſſion in the caſe of Gods honour although it be to our owne temporall confuſion; It was <hi>Achans</hi> caſe, and in every oath and ſolemn proteſtation we make and take, it is ours. Juggle wee not with our all knowing God, equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, mentall reſervations, and other cunning eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiions, may deceive, elude, and delude men, and bee we not deceived; <hi>God can we not deceive, hee will not be mocked: as we ſow, we ſhall reape, or corruption or life everlaſting, Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. If we hide our ſinnes, we ſhall not proſper, God will not loſe his <hi>glory,</hi> but if we confeſſe them and forſake them, God ſhall have the <hi>glory,</hi> and we ſhall have the comfort; <hi>Hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy, Prov.</hi> 28. 13.</p>
            <p>Againe wee doe <hi>glorifie</hi> God when his promiſes even in all our troubles are laid hold on by our faith. We reade of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of all in the Faith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he <hi>ſtaggerd not at the promiſe, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, but was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God, Rom.</hi> 4. 20. The Receiver of Chriſts teſtimony hath ſet to his Seale, that God is true (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> hath it) in the Goſpell by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> cha. 3. 33. When God hath made knowne his will unto us in his Word, good reaſon it is that every one of us ſhould thereunto give our full aſſent and conſent, we muſt confeſſe it ingenuouſly, &amp; profeſſe it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never be aſhamed thereof. And this is as a ſetting too of our Seale, that God is true, and in ſo doing, we doe <hi>glorifie</hi> our God, and it is a chiefe point of honour which of us he requireth, and indeed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe the Goſpell is the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:156560:14"/>
of the Goſpell, the full of a Chriſtian, of <hi>God</hi> accepted for mans Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee doe <hi>glorifie</hi> God in a perpetuated courſe of good workes; So our Saviour plainely and expreſly. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven, Matth.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we then doe <hi>glorifie</hi> our God when we doe proſtrate our ſelves in the truth of humility, and and humiliation before God. That of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> to the proud generation of the Phariſees is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably obſervable. <hi>How can yee beleeve which receive honour one from another, and ſeeke not the honour that commeth from God only? Iohn</hi> 5. 44. An uſuall and a juſt courſe is it with God to abaſe the lifted up, and to lift up the abaſed in their owne eyes, to caſt down the mighty from their ſeates, and to exalt the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meeke; As the not givers of <hi>glory</hi> unto <hi>God</hi> ſhall be <hi>unglorious</hi> at the laſt for ever; ſo the <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers</hi> of God in the right way of humbleneſſe ſhall after petty diſregards and diſgraces here from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed men be ſhining ſtars above in <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, wee doe <hi>glorifie</hi> our God in our cloſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the cauſe of God, where ever and however oppoſed and vilified in the ſcornefull world, and in being ſeriouſly tranſported with a regular zeale un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>glory</hi> of our God, not regarding at all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme in the world in that regard. In this frozen age variouſly humerous this is rarely practiſed, the leaſt, very leaſt word that toucheth our owne repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, goes as a dagger to our hearts; but God in horrid oaths and execrations is every where lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156560:15"/>
and lewdly blaſphemed: his Church ſervants by the moſt vilified and ſcorned, and it troubles not our hearts at all, yea ſcarce our eares. O times, O man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!</p>
            <p>Alaſſe! how few <hi>Lots</hi> are there in this <hi>Sodome,</hi> the preſent evill world? <hi>Lot vexed his righteous ſoule day by day, in ſeeing and hearing the unlawfull deeds of that City where he ſojourned.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 8. Wee ſee and heare enough the like every day, and every night, and all houres and moments of both: God is diſhonoured impudently every where, his ordinances abuſed, his holy name and attributes odiouſly polluted with rotten language, out of their reeking Sepulcher throat vented, and poyſoning where it is with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light entertained: no ſin abſtained from, yea even with greedineſſe unaſhamedly committed. It may be ſaid of the moſt of both ſexes in this age which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> uttereth of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Iudah, Their tongue, and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory, the ſhew of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth witneſſe againſt them, and they declare their ſinne as Sodome; they hide it not, woe unto their ſoule, for they have rewarded evill unto themſelves, Eſay</hi> 3. 8, 9. We may adde with the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and paralell this Nation with that. <hi>Behold this was the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thy ſiſter Sodome. Pride, fulneſſe of bread, and abundance of Idleneſſe was in her daughters, neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hand of the poore and needy; And they were haughty and committed abomination before mee, therefore I tooke them away as I ſaw good, Ezek.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 49, 50. That our ſelves prove not an Hiſtory in this kind let the recorded Hiſtories of <hi>Sodom, Gomorra, Ieruſalem</hi> be our forewarning, their plagues will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall

us, if by ſerious and timely repentance we break not off our courſes in the very ſame kinde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſinning. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit was exceedingly ſtirred in him, when he ſaw the City of <hi>Athens</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to Idolatry, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 16. And do not ſome doate on Images with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and others on Imaginations with <hi>Factioniſts?</hi> How few are right in the right way of Gods preſcriptions? which is <hi>Iehovah Elohenu, Iehovah Echad,</hi> the Lord our God is one Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. Out of him all is but a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and no Religion ſound and ſolid, but what wee have from the dictates of his holy ſpirit. This Lord our God, this one Lord hath <hi>made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, even the wicked for the day of evill, Prov.</hi> 16. 4. Aſſuredly God will be <hi>glorified</hi> if not by us, then on us; if not for his mercies in our deliverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely then for his judgements in our ſentencing to hell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The wicked ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> He that will not voluntarily <hi>glorifie God</hi> as the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in the rigour of juſtice will our God <hi>glorifie</hi> himſelfe in his eternall ruine. If wee prove not the Heralds of his glory; examples ſhall we be of his juſt indignation. <hi>When his wrath is kindled but a little, O bleſſed are they that in him repoſe their truſt, Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. accurſedneſſe ſhall enfetter all others in the chaines of everlaſting darkneſſe. O! my beloved in the Lord; What ever we have been heretofore, be this hence forward to the end of our <hi>pilgrimage,</hi> and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare on earth, our maineſt care never any more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave the grace of God in vaine, never turn the ſame into laſciviouſneſſe, which Saint <hi>Iude</hi> fitly calls, <hi>the denying of the only Lord God, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:156560:16"/>
improve wee rather with all manner of alacrity and induſtriouſneſſe the talents thereof unto us concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited to the <hi>glory</hi> of our God, upon our receiving the end of our faith, even our endleſſe ſalvation.</p>
            <p>By words; by works, in our lives and at our deaths ſet wee forth the prayſes of our gratious deliverer, with the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> from the ground of our hearts, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, who daily loadeth us with his benefits, even the God of our ſalvation,</hi> he that is our God, is the God of our ſalvation, <hi>And unto God the Lord belong the iſsues from death, Pſalme</hi> 68. 19, 20.
