         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

then did sore travail come upon you, pangs took hold on every side, and great was the cries that then was heard; now was your Deliverance nigh at hand, and his only begotten came into the World, this was the day in which the poor found help, and that of low degree was raised up, then the Prisoner came out of the pit, and the Captive was delivered out of Iron bonds, so did his work prosper in his hand, and deliverance came by his eternal Power, you felt his terrour upon the wicked, and none was able to resist his might, his stroak was heavy on your loynes, and feebleness possest your reins, for in his wrath he sealed you down, and you languisht in the deep distress; then did your cry <hi>go up unto him,</hi> and the earnest breathed for <hi>relief,</hi> his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els yearned to his own, and his love brake forth like <hi>a mighty stream,</hi> his ear was open for to <hi>hear,</hi> and his Arme ready to <hi>deliver,</hi> for he <hi>remembred his holy Covenant,</hi> and his <hi>own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> whom he <hi>had chosen,</hi> he did not leave you when you were <hi>weary,</hi> nor forsake you when you were <hi>feeble,</hi> but in the deep he was your <hi>strength,</hi> and in your travail he you <hi>upheld,</hi> so did he lead you in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and yet his Judgments are all <hi>true;</hi> you walked in the narrow way, and his Arm of power was your <hi>support,</hi> he brought you thorow the gate of <hi>Death,</hi> and raised up the seed of <hi>Life,</hi> his love is not to be <hi>expressed,</hi> nor the works of his hands to be <hi>declared,</hi> for in the midst of <hi>Judgment he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred Mercy,</hi> and his eye of pitty was open towards you; the Lyon could not prey upon you, his mouth he <hi>stopped;</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer could not spoil you, him he <hi>judged; Pharaoh</hi> could not keep you, him he <hi>Plagued;</hi> the Grave could not shut you up, that he <hi>opened,</hi> and out of the horrible pit he you <hi>delivered,</hi> then did the poor find help in his <hi>Power,</hi> and the needy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> he stretched forth his Arm, and Salvation came, and that was wrought which no other could do, though you had run from man to man, and had enquired after God, and sought to have obtained Peace, yet none could bring true tydings of it, but still you mourned for want of <hi>Life,</hi> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in the anguish of your Spirits, <hi>running</hi> but <hi>obtained</hi> not, <hi>seeking</hi> but could not <hi>find,</hi> until you was wearied in sore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and ready to faint under your heavy burthens; then did you <hi>cry in your deep distress, and he heard out of his holy Hill;</hi> he made the Fountain open wide, and his Salvation did not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

            <p>Oh Friends, what hath the Lord done for you! pen cannot write, nor tongue declare; you were <hi>lost</hi> and he <hi>sought</hi> you, <hi>Strangers</hi> and he <hi>gathered</hi> you, <hi>Enemies</hi> and he <hi>Reconciled</hi> you, <hi>Sinners</hi> and he <hi>Saved</hi> you; what could the Lord <hi>do more for you?</hi> Mountains are fallen, the Earth is melted, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer is spoil'd, for <hi>against the mighty hath the Lord appeared,</hi> and his work hath been prosperous in his hand, he hath brought death upon the <hi>first man,</hi> and all <hi>his deeds</hi> he hath destroyed, he hath quickned the <hi>second,</hi> and in his power he is <hi>raised,</hi> and in <hi>glory</hi> is his <hi>only begotten</hi> come into the world, and unto him must the gathering be; you are blessed in whom he is revealed, who feels your <hi>Union</hi> with his <hi>Life,</hi> and your <hi>Translation</hi> into his <hi>Likeness;</hi> abide <hi>with him,</hi> depart not <hi>from him,</hi> for there is not another that <hi>can save,</hi> or <hi>can refresh</hi> the wearied ones, for many have for saken him, and have not continued faithful to him, though for a time they followed him, and whil'st they did abide was faithful in him, <hi>but when Tribulation came they started a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> and is turned into a <hi>withered branch,</hi> for they could not abide the <hi>Judgement,</hi> nor the <hi>straitness</hi> of the <hi>way</hi> to walk in, but sought for <hi>ease</hi> and a <hi>carnal liberty,</hi> and so departed from the Lord after they was <hi>Enlightned,</hi> and of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Power tasted;</hi> and having <hi>Erred</hi> from the <hi>Right Way,</hi> they have been again <hi>Entangled,</hi> and a yoak of bondage is come upon their <hi>necks,</hi> so hath the Enemy wrought upon them, and drawn them from the needful thing, that no <hi>Life</hi> is <hi>possessed,</hi> nor <hi>Power enjoyed,</hi> but <hi>Antichrist Exalted,</hi> and the <hi>Temple filled</hi> with a dry spirit, that deadness and drowsiness is over the living, the oyl being stope, the spirit of slumber entred, &amp; the Lamp is filled with it, that when he comes he is not <hi>regarded,</hi> nor no Readiness to receive him, for there is no delight in <hi>waiting</hi> for him; so have many lost their <hi>First Love,</hi> and are <hi>Erred</hi> from the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi>
