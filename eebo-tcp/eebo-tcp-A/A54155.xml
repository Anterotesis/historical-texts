            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Juſt Defence of our ſo much Reviled Principles and Perſons is ſo ill reſented by our Enemies, that inſtead of publickly Recanting their Injuſtice, They repute us more Criminal for ſo doing, then themſelves in firſt Traducing us. It is become a ſort of <hi>Petty Treaſon</hi> to Reprove them, they are grown almoſt incorrigible; and to Controle them, though in a <hi>Lye,</hi> is hateful: ſo much more do they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Deſtruction, then the Truth it ſelf, or their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Strange! That it ſhould be reputed Innocency to Accuſe the Guiltleſs, and Guilt to Defend them. Are we of God, then ſhall we ſtand, maugre your Aſſaults; if not, we ſhall fall without them. What need this <hi>Clubbing</hi> for Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and <hi>Caballing</hi> to our Ruin? The <hi>Jews,</hi> I believe, never ſtudied the <hi>Crucifying of Chriſt</hi> more vehemently, then you vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly combine and plot the <hi>Maſſacring</hi> of our <hi>Names, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> out of the World: yea, and we have Cauſe to ſuſpect our <hi>Perſons</hi> too; or elſe this <hi>Socinian-Defender of the Hat-Spirit,</hi> would never have told the World in almoſt ſo many words, that Blaſphemers were to dye by the Law of God, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Blaſphemers; every Man can make the Concluſion; that underſtands what a Concluſion is, ſee pag. 23.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93328:3"/>
Its a Work becomes Darkneſs; for ſuch I call your Nameleſs <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> in which you have abuſed Vertuous and Good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Name, not daring to ſtand the Teſt of putting your Names to your Abuſes; againſt which can be no Fence but Innocency, and that remains Unſhaken by all your <hi>Bluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Epithetes:</hi> That reſts with God, who will quell your ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Rage, and ſpeedily Rebuke that great <hi>Herricane</hi> your Envy has raiſed to over-ſet us in our Voyage to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt. But he that ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> in an Hour of Straight, <hi>Stand ſtill, and thou ſhalt ſee my Salvation,</hi> has once and again Comforted us under all theſe Diſcouragements: Neither are your Combinations Terrible; No, though <hi>Evil Spyes</hi> have been your <hi>Informers.</hi> Our greateſt Trouble is your own Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, and we are ſorry to ſee you make ſo much haſte to old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s <hi>Portion</hi>: For us, we know in whom we have believed; And as he that feedeth the Fowls of the Air, and clotheth the Lillies of the Field, preſerves us, ſo that your Buffettings may prove our Tryals, but in the End your own Judgments. For, however you buoy your ſelves up, by the Acceptance you find with ſome Airy or Prejudiced Spirits, God will certainly enter into Judgment with you for your Envious Proceeding, who not being able to carry on your own Controverſies, now <hi>liſt your ſelves Combatants</hi> for a few ſtragling Apoſtates; not out of Love to true <hi>Quakers,</hi> but Hatred to ſuch as are ſo. What Senſe is there in believing you only intend a Falſe <hi>Quaker,</hi> who have writ and abetted thoſe Writings that are againſt us as <hi>Quakers</hi> at all? But what ſhall I ſay? It is an Age grown to that Degree of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, that there is no Friendſhip ſo Strait, no Relation ſo Near, no Truth ſo Evident, nor Life ſo Innocent, that ſome Men are not hardy, and wicked enough to Break, Violate and Slander, to Avenge ſome ſuppoſed Wrong, or gratifie an Emulous Spirit. <hi>Controverſie End,</hi> upon <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles, &amp;c. is riſen now in one, about the <hi>Hat on in Prayer.</hi> What Variety of Shapes do our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> put on to compaſs their Ends? It has been their Practice, firſt to Abuſe our Principles, and then Rail at our Defences; and for Vindicating our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to fall foul upon our Perſons; and thoſe chiefly who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93328:3"/>
are moſt active in that Service. There needs no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this, then the Scurrilous <hi>Libel</hi> now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; which with me carries ſo Miſchievous an Aſpect, that the Parties concerned in theſe Undertakings do by it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, they only want as much Power, as Will, <hi>to ſend us and our Principles to</hi> New-England <hi>for a Venture.</hi> God deliver us from thoſe Magiſtrates, that are as Angry in Government, as theſe Men are in Religion; But this is our Joy, That theſe Enemies ſpeak all manner of Evil againſt us falſly, for our Lord and Saviour's ſake. We maintain our Principles, that angers them; Miſcarriages joy them, whatever they pretend; And if they can bring ſome Writers and Preachers out of Requeſt, they think they do their Buſineſs. But we cannot believe that Sober and Judicious Perſons will think the worſe of us or our Cauſe, for theſe Malicious Endeavours againſt it. We have only to do with ſome old <hi>Adverſaries</hi> new Vampt, with the Slanderous Stories of ſome modern Apoſtates. Had not <hi>Judas</hi> helpt, the <hi>Jews</hi> had been to ſeek. A few Vagabond <hi>Quakers</hi> are their Intelligencers; its all but a piece of Treachery and Envy: And truly 'tis fit we ſhould be tryed as well by Falſe Friends as Profeſſed Enemies, that in all things we may approve our ſelves compleat Conquerors, through the Invincibe Power, and to the alone Honour of that Eternal Truth profeſſed by us. And ſo we enter upon the <hi>Libel</hi> it ſelf.</p>

However, he declares himſelf of no <hi>Party,</hi> by which I ſuppoſe he excludes the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; for the Prophane of that Time reputed him a Sectary, and all muſt acknowledge him to be of a Party. How I came to be of this Way, is beſt known to God; But thus much I muſt ſay, that nothing ſhort of the Divine Word of Life and Power has worked that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration upon me from what I once was, to what I now am.

               <p>'Tis a Truth, and as true, that we urge, both the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality and Sufficiency of the Light to Salvation; and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man ought to follow only the Teachings of it about Faith and Worſhip. This is granted on all hands, even by the <hi>Cabal</hi> to credit their preſent Work, and obtain their envious Ends upon us and our Principles; Therefore no part of the Queſtion to be controverted.

               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is ſo evident in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> That to reject it, is nothing leſs then to deny Scripture it ſelf.

                  <hi>which come to you in Sheeps Cloathing.</hi> Again, <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you; For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall come in my Name; ſaying I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Whence it follows, that there ſhould be <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> yet in <hi>Sheeps Cloathing,</hi> which is a deceitful Spirit, acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der refined Appearances: and to compaſs its Deceit the better, ſhall palliate it, with the Pretence of being led by the Spirit or <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt within: So that as Deceitful Spirits were foretold, the Way to know them was both promiſed and enjoyed;<note rend="inter">Joh. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice,</hi> ſaid the great Shepherd, <hi>and a Stranger will they not hear.</hi> Who is this Stranger? Not alwayes Falſe Doctrine, but a Falſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, covered with True Doctrine, <hi>They ſhall come in my Name,</hi> that is, pretending Authority from me, and ſpeaking my Words, not having my Spirit: Chriſt's Spirit within, is his Voice within, and 'tis that alone gives to diſcern the Strange Voice, let it come with never ſuch True Words. Had Chriſt left his Churches deſtitute of this Touch-Stone, they had been impoſed upon by every Falſe Spirit, and his Flock devoured by every Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing. Sheep know Sheep, not only by Sight, but Inſtinct, and Wolves too; For if Shepherds be of Authority, they tell us, <hi>that if a Wolf be near, though out of Sight, the Sheep will bleat their Antipathy</hi>: So do the Sheep of Chriſt know each other by the Inſtinct of that Divine Nature they are mutually Partakers of, and by it do they diſcern the <hi>Wolf within,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>the Sheep's Cloathing without.</hi> It was for this end they were to have <hi>Salt</hi> in themſelves, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing and Spirit in themſelves, that they might ſee, reliſh and diſcern thereby, who were ſo Salted, Anointed and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which in the ground could never be viſibly diſcerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> Queſtion I alſo take in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and for which there is both expreſs Scripture, and Unanſwerable Reaſon. This is ſeen in the very caſe of <hi>Alexander the Copper-Smith,</hi> who was denyed and rejected, notwithſtanding that he made Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; And there is cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Difference began <hi>from his emulous Spirit's taking Occaſion againſt the Apoſtles Authority,</hi> and the Power of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93328:7"/>
in the Church. It was doubtleſs for ſomething not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to this, that <hi>Paul</hi> complained of him to <hi>Timothy, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Copper-Smith did me much wrong, of whom be thou ware alſo; for he hath greatly withſtood our Words.</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">2 Tim. 4.14, 15, 16.</note> Which is the very State and Character of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> Who pretend with <hi>Alexander,</hi> not to withſtand Truth or Chriſtianity; but a <hi>Lordly Paul, Timothy, or ſuch like eminent Labourers:</hi> They pretend to own the Churches, but deny ſome of their <hi>Leading Miniſters.</hi> That this was <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander's Diſeaſe,</hi> the next Verſe proves; <hi>At my firſt Anſwer no Man ſtood with me, but all Men forſooke me.

And what was <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander's</hi> aim beſides Ambition? I mean, to diſcredit the Apoſtle, that he might gain the Repute, and being him down from that Authority God had given him in the Church, that he might uſurp it to himſelf. What did the Apoſtle do in the like caſe? ſhrink? No; Hear him: <hi>For though I ſhould boaſt ſomewhat more of our Authority (which the Lord hath given us for Edification, and not for your Deſtruction) I ſhould not be aſhamed.</hi> 2 Cor. 10 8. But no more of this at preſent. That Chriſt as well gave his Church Power to reject as to try Spirits, is not hard to prove. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Paſſage, <hi>Go, tell the Church,</hi> does it to our hand: For if in caſe of private Offence betwixt Brethren, the Church is made abſolute Judge, from whom there is no Appeal in this World; how much more in any the leaſt Caſe that concerns the Nature, Being, Faith and Worſhip of the Church her ſelf? The Judgment Chriſt paſſeth in the matter, is ſufficient to the Reſolution of our Queſtion;<note rend="inter">Math. 18.17.</note> 
                  <hi>But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a</hi> Heathen <hi>and a Publican.</hi> This I ſay on the Account of thoſe <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> who pretend to be the Men they ever were; For this Man that works with their Tooles, is upon his own Principle, as much an <hi>Heathen</hi> and a <hi>Publican</hi> as any thing elſe, and tells us to boot, <hi>that it is dangerous to be of any one Party</hi>; Therefore not of the <hi>true Churche's Party.</hi> I omit any particular recital of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s frequent &amp; earneſt Dehortations from ſo much <hi>as keeping company with perverſe Diſputers about needleſs Queſtions,</hi> or any that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93328:8"/>
infeſted the Church, and diſturbed her Peace and that Practice, in which ſhe was at firſt ſetled, with unprofitable Novelties, under what Pretence ſoever: They that can read, may find in his Epiſtles enough to this purpoſe. 'Tis true, They uſed no corporal Violence, or any civil Power to puniſh ſuch obſtinate Diſſenters; nor is that Unchriſtian Practice ſo much as any part of the Queſtion: But firſt, to reprove and admoniſh, and in caſe of Perſiſtance, then to diſown and reject, which is a part of the Queſtion, and a part of the Scripture too. And indeed it is moſt reaſonable, that as a Civil, ſo a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſhould have this Power to preſerve it ſelf from the <hi>Taints</hi> &amp; <hi>Infections</hi> of hurtful Spirits, for ſuch tend not to further Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Increaſe in Holineſs, or Peace, but Strifes and Diviſions, Animoſities and Rents, Backbitings and Revenge, to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſte of God's holy Heritage.</p>
               <p>3ly, The <hi>third</hi> Queſtion we alſo accept in the affirmative. <hi>That men may believe, confeſs and ſubſcribe to the Truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality, Sufficiency, and immediate Teachings of the Light, as to Faith and Worſhip, and yet be declined from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Senſe, Power and Ordering of it, ſo as to be acted by a wrong Spirit to Diviſions, and notwithſtanding plead his Following of the Light within againſt the Judgment of the Church, who reproves him for ſo doing.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>that a man may follow a Wrong Spirit when he thinks he follows the Right; and though he ought to follow the Light and Spirit, yet is to be judged when he does not act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (though he may think he doth) by ſuch as walk thereby.</hi> In this, the Scriptures of Truth are very poſitive. The <hi>Jews</hi> owned the Law at what time they rebelled againſt it, and thought they acted according to Scripture, when by their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they made it of none Effect. There was a certain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration <hi>that were pure in their own Eyes,</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">Prov. 30.12.</note> That is believed themſelves to be of a Right Spirit, whom the holy Ghoſt reproved for being guided by a Wrong one. It was no other State then this that Chriſt ſpoke of, when he ſaid,<note rend="inter">Mat. 6.22.</note> 
                  <hi>If therefore the Light that is in thee be Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how great is that Darkneſs?</hi> Some doubtleſs acted by Virtue of this Darkneſs, not as Darkneſs, but as Light; Was it therefore Light becauſe they thought ſo? When
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93328:8"/>
it is manifeſt that they were againſt Chriſt, the true Light, as you are now. Or, would the Plea of ſuch an one be ſo valid againſt the Body of a Church walking in the true Light, as to diſengage any from her judgment? Or, muſt we therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Light is not a Rule for Men to walk by, becauſe ſome miſtake, or ſwarve from it? Or, that he who calls his dark Imagination, a Motion of Light, is therefore not to be condemned, becauſe it is every Man's Duty to follow the True Light? Shall this Poſition, I ſay, that all Men ought to follow the Light in themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lves, deprive the Church of the Power of Judging that for a dark Imagination, which from the Savour and Senſe of God's Light and Truth, ſhe feels to be ſo; becauſe ſome Perſon or Perſons plead that they therein follow the Light? This opens a Door to all Licentiouſneſs, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every <hi>Libertine</hi> with a Plea. What might have been ſaid in this Caſe againſt the ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi>? Every Man ought to walk in the Spirit, and to be led by the Spirit; Shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Man's Pretence to be led by the Spirit that is not, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him from the Judgment of thoſe that are really led by the Spirit? Or, ſhall the Judgment of thoſe, who are led by the Spirit, againſt him that pretends to be ſo led, be reputed <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> and a going from the Leadings and Judgment of the Spirit, to the Leadings and Judgment of Men? Or, becauſe of granting the Light to be obeyed in all its Leadings? and its Leadings to be waited for in order to Faith and Worſhip; that therefore there is no way left to judge which are in the Wrong of the Two that equally ſay, <hi>they are led by the ſame Light</hi>? For if Men would come to the Salt, Grace, Truth, and faithful Witneſs in themſelves, which only gives to diſcern and ſavour True Spirits from Falſe ones, they would hereby arrive at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge in the Matter; but where People ſtand, they can never diſtinguiſh, becauſe they are from under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Spirit, which alone reveals the deep things of God. In ſhort, as no Man's ſaying <hi>he is in the Right,</hi> ought to conclude him to be in the Right; ſo neither can that hinder that he ſhould not be found out by ſuch as are in the Right Spirit, to be in the Wrong, if in it. He that ſayes <hi>he is ruled by the Scripture</hi> may err, as well as he that ſayes <hi>he is led by the Light</hi>;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93328:9"/>
therefore is he not to be cenſured? Or is there no certain Way of knowing him to be in the Wrong? It is the Spirit of Truth that opens the Truth of Scripture; much more can it <hi>only</hi> give to reliſh Spirits. Which leads to the <hi>laſt</hi> Queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>Whether the People, called</hi> Quakers, <hi>or thoſe few ſtragling Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of</hi> John Perrot <hi>are this True Church, and acted by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light and Spirit, yea or nay</hi>? To anſwer this Queſtion I ſhall keep very cloſe to the Conceſſions of theſe preſent <hi>Apoſtates</hi>; For it is not ſo much my Buſineſs at this time to prove us a True Church to them that never had any Relation to us, as againſt thoſe who acknowledge themſelves once to have been of us, but now decline us.</p>

Has Her Refuſing to conform to <hi>John Perrot</hi>'s Innovation of the Hat on in time of publick Prayer unchurched Her? I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thought, that a <hi>Society</hi>'s going from, or adding to, what it was when truly called a <hi>Church,</hi> was that which only did Unchurch it, and not its continuing as it was; And if this be good Arguing, The People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> remain ſtill the ſame Chruch, <hi>but their Adverſaries not the ſame Members.</hi> In ſhort, where the firſt Occaſion of Offence was given, there was the firſt Breach of Unity. Had the Church impoſed upon them, there would be ſome reaſon for varying of her Character, and condemning her as Fallen; But the Innovation being their own, ſhe is not accountable unto them, but they to her, for ſuch unwarrantable Novelties: ſo that the Queſtion is not, Whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> impoſe, but <hi>Whether they did not innovate</hi>? All was well till this Imagination was hatched; <hi>The Spirit of Judgment and Burning had its courſe; Their Veſſells were filled

Which wretched Deciet, me-thinks, ſhould be obvious to every impartial Reader. There is no Wiſdom to believe Men ſo inconſtant to their own Apprehenſions, and who of all times in which to prove this great Alteration, ſhould make Choice of that, in which was ſo great a Perſecution, and ſo Noble a Teſtimony born for the Truth. viz. 1662. But the Truth of the matter is this. <hi>John Perrot</hi> (who if he had been as faithful as his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, might with him have been hanged at <hi>Rome</hi> (as we have been informed) to his own Comfort, the Truth's Honour, and the Churches Peace) came home as filled with Conceit, as he pretended his Body had been oppreſſed with Sufferings, which kindling ſo great a Love in the Hearts of ſome Tender Friends, as they unwarily became Incouragers of his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their too high exilting and lamenting his Sufferings, Which having rendered him <hi>Maſter</hi> of their Affections, they moſt of them eaſily became Embracers of his Invention. We had reaſon to believe it had almoſt been impoſſible for him ever to have made one <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> had not the noiſe of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Tryals diſpoſed the Hearts of ſome affectionate People to receive his Impreſſion; He that will pleaſe to conſider the <hi>improbable Account he vainly gave of his own Sufferings, ſaying, that ſince</hi> Adam's <hi>Day none had ever undergone the like his ſingular Style; Proverbial Chapters in imitation of</hi> Solomon; <hi>his Toyiſh conceited Rhymes; his Title page of the Wren in the burning Buſh waving her Wings of Contraction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>his peculiar Subſcription, which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> JOHN (<hi>and could not be ſo becauſe there was no more of that Name amongſt us, but becauſe he would be the</hi> JOHN <hi>of</hi> JOHNS) and which is yet more ridiculous, in a Letter to ſeveral grave Women, <hi>your dear</hi> SISTER JOHN <hi>with his abſurd new fangled bodily Greetings, his moſt Papal Salutations</hi> to <hi>G.

as if he had ſpent his time in Learning all the Superlative Complements of <hi>Rome</hi>: I ſay, he that pleaſes to conſider theſe things, muſt needs think, that the Man had loſt his Guide, and was dangerouſly elevated above the holy Fear of God, and heavenly Life of the Truth; and his Standing being ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by ſeveral Weighty Friends, he was ſoberly, ſecretly and frequently dealt withall; his Condition repreſented, his Danger ſhewn, and a Station of Safety pointed to him: It was the daily Travel of many, who ſought his Wel-fare, and the Churche's Peace, to bring him to a Sence of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; But no Argument or Entreaties could prevail, no Sighs or Tears could ſoften him, but reſolved he was for a Sect-Maſter, and his Mark muſt be, the <hi>Hat on in time of Publick Prayer.</hi> That which yet whetted many ſimple Hearts to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example, was with his Sufferings, his Phariſaical Pretences to a higher Diſpenſation, but inſtead of ſhewing them a readier Way to an higher State of Holineſs, he diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Minds from the more weighty things of the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, to contend for that rude and unprofitable Practice of the <hi>Hat on in time of publick Prayer</hi>; an Invention to no Edification, but to the great Diſturbance of the Church: Thus began what rent he ſought to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. Before this, we were at Peace, our <hi>Sion</hi> proſperous; and thoſe <hi>Apoſtate Adverſaries</hi> allowed us to be God's Church, his choſen People. I appeal now to the whole World of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and impartial People, whether we acted herein, unlike <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſober and prudent Men? And if any of our publick Enemies, who pretend to own a Church-Authority (ſome of them alſo being Members and Leaders) would not have done the like? Muſt we ſuffer for that which they juſtifie? We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a Practice we had no Authority for, neither without, nor within: We ſaw <hi>Who</hi> brought it in, and <hi>What</hi> acted him, with the bent and tendency of it; And it was as much our Duty to withſtand the Entrance of that wich was Wrong, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Practice of that which was Right, and ſetled in the Power of God long before among us: We might invert their Plea much more truly; The Light within enjoyned us to diſown them, had we not then ſinned to have decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93328:10"/>
Or, is our Light <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> becauſe they call their Darkneſs <hi>Light</hi>? In ſhort, the <hi>Church</hi> never knew it, when ſo much admired by her preſent Enemies; And becauſe when it came, ſhe rejected it, therefore are they become her Enemies, which proves <hi>Them,</hi> and not the Church, <hi>to be changed.</hi> But ſuppoſing we had nothing of this to our Defence. What is become of the once acknowledged Bleſſed Church, and her Powerful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? If we have loſt both, who has found them? If due to any Body, in caſe our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> be in the Right, it muſt be to them: But I know of no <hi>Church,</hi> nor do I hear of any <hi>Miniſtry</hi> they have, nor the <hi>Power</hi> of God manifeſt among them, either for the Building up of themſelves, or the Gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of others. What! Is the <hi>Church</hi> already returned into the Wilderneſs? and is the <hi>Power</hi> loſt, which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was once amongſt us, and to God's Eternal Praiſe, we daily witneſs in the City and Country to attend our Travels? But as they were not of God in their Diſſenſions; ſo neither have they ſtood. We ſuffer as we did; The World loves them more then it did; They are Friends, but both Enemies to us. Their <hi>Sect Maſter</hi> returned with the Dog to the Vomit, to <hi>Swearing, Fighting, fine Cloathes, Cap and Knee to Men, who could ſit on his B—with his Hat on his Head, when he prayed to the moſt high God. Some of his Followers run into Looſeneſs and Rantiſm; others into Enmity and Earthly-Mindedneſs; but far the more conſiderable returned to their firſt Love and Workes, whom God hath ſince frequently bleſt with his heavenly Preſence, and ſealed to them the Comfort of the holy Communion of the Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſum up what we have been ſaying. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The True Church of Chriſt, by the Gift of the holy Spirit, from Chriſt, the Head, is enabled to try, ſavour and reliſh Wrong Spirits under never ſuch Right Appearances, as that, without which ſhe could never be preſerved <hi>from the Wolves that are in Sheep's Cloathing, nor the Deceivers that come with Chriſt's Words out of Chriſt's Power and Life. Secondly,</hi> That this Church hath as well Power to reject the falſe Spirit, as to try it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That men may be in the Words and not the Spirit of Truth; that notwithſtanding it is the Duty of all Men, to act by the Light and Spirit within, that hinders not, that ſuch as walk not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93328:11"/>
to the Light within, though they may pretend to do it, ſhould be known and judged of them that really do ſo. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That we were this True Church of God by our <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Adverſaries</hi> own Confeſſion: And we have proved, <hi>that not we, but our Adverſaries have altered (ſince the time that large Confeſſion mentions) by giving the Offence, and making the firſt Breach of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> notwithſtanding the many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Courſes that were taken to reſtore them, and preſerve Concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Brethren: Therefore our Judgment of them is not that of a <hi>Dark, Dead Body,</hi> but a Living, Spiritual Society, and in the Gift, Diſcerning and Authority of God's holy and unerring Spirit, which they acknowledge we once had, and cannot prove, when, and by what we loſt it. And bleſſed be the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, <hi>his Living Power is with us, be owns our Miniſtry and Fellowſhip in the Hearts of Thouſands, yea Ten Thouſands have bowed to the Righteouſneſs of his Scepter, ſince the, day that perverſe</hi> Core <hi>firſt troubled our</hi> Iſrael. <hi>No Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als have ſcattered us, nor Sufferings worn us out; but, to the Honour of the bleſſed Name of the Lord, we have been by it kept to this day, whoſe Goodneſs renews with the Morning, and whoſe Mercies endures forever.

               <p>But perhaps they will both endeavour to avoid the <hi>Dint</hi> of theſe convincing Arguments, thus, <hi>We deny not the Body of the People, called</hi> Quakers, <hi>nor as they act in the Light, that they have true Judgment; But we complain againſt your</hi> Foxonian <hi>

               <p>But ſhould we allow this to be True, as we reject it for a Slander, 'tis granted to us, that the Body of the People, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> is not their Aim, but ſome few particulars that make not up the hundreth part of the Church (and who will in the things objected ſufficiently clear themſelves) ſo that the Judgment of the Body is not denyed, becauſe of the Judgment of ſome few Elders that diſpleaſe them. the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion then will be, whether the Body in all Places concerned has given its Judgment againſt that innovating Spirit of <hi>John Perrot,</hi> yea or nay? The Determination of which Queſtion gives a great In-ſight into the preſent Controverſie; In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which I offer two things to be conſidered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in all Places where <hi>Jo.

That of the Church, in the Fear and Preſence of the Eternal God ſhe worſhips, according to his free Spirit, and that Diſcerning which was given her of him, concerning which, if there be any Scruple, in the publick canvas of this Matter, we can readily produce a multitude of Certificates to verifie it. 2. The Judgment of many conſiderable Perſons againſt themſelves and their own Practice, whoſe Simplicity was betrayed by that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93328:12"/>
diſſentious Spirit. But it ſo happens, that ſome of them, of how good Report ſoever, are now not to be credited, becauſe it croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Humor of theſe Envious Authors, and their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Adherents. What Name ſhall we call this Partiallity by? who praiſed their Honeſty when they eſpouſed the Hat, and now queſtion their Conſcience in declaring their Miſtake: And ſuch is the Fool-Hardineſs and Vanity of this <hi>Socinian Apologizer</hi> in the Defence of the <hi>Hat on in Prayer,</hi> That in a great Marginal Note, he cryes out, <hi>What's become of</hi> John Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good'<hi>s Integrity, that he ſhould put his Name among ſuch Men as theſe?</hi> As if we had committed all the Infamies prohibited in the firſt and ſecond Table of God's Law, rather then ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably given check to the boundleſs Novelties of an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Innovatour.

               <p>But why muſt not the reſt be credited? Are they deceived in Returning? Shew it. Was it impoſed upon them, as they ſuggeſt? Prove it. <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> if he has not loſt all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Memory, can tell them another Story; For as became the People of God, for the Deciſion of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, a very great Meeting was deſired and appointed, unto which both ſorts willingly reſorted; So that it was not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but Choice: In which great and earneſt were the Deſires and Travels of thoſe who had oppoſed the Spirit of <hi>John Perrot,</hi> that the Lord himſelf would pleaſe in ſome ſignal manner to break forth amongſt them, that the Judgment which ſhould paſs among them, in order to a Reconciliation, might not be accounted the Judgment of Man, but the Judgment of God. Theſe faithful Cryes entered the Ears of the God of Peace, whoſe Compaſſions fail not, That with an high Hand and an out-ſtretched Arm, he rent through the Meeting, that both Sorts were greatly broken, and humbled before the Lord.

AS Man conſiſts of Soul and Body, and as the Body is a kind of Form to the Soul, ſo whilſt Body and Soul remain unſeparated, there will and muſt be ſome Form ſuited to the Body, whereby to expreſs the publick, Spiritual Worſhip performed by the Soul: ſuch are <hi>Places, Words</hi> and <hi>Geſtures</hi>; and in the Performance of ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Body can no more be exempted from ſome Form or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, then can the Soul in its inward and ſpiritual Station. To deny this, is to denote a Man void of Senſe and Reaſon; ſo that though we grant the outward &amp; inward Coming of Chriſt, to have abrogated ſuch Types and Figures as foreſhewed a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glory, yet Tokens and Demonſtrations of preſent inward Reverence a Divine Honour to God in publick Performance of Worſhip, not only we never denyed, but do affirm them to be as adequate or proper to the Body, as are the Reverence and Honour to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, in the ſolemn and publick performance of <hi>Prayer</hi> unto the Lord, to pull off our Hats, to expreſs the Unvailing of our Spirits, and that reverent Submiſſion and Supplication, which becomes poor Petitioners to come in, and offer up their Deſires with, to the great King of Glory, and God of the Spirits of all Fleſh;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93328:14"/>
and God has made it a Token of inward Homage by the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of his own Truth. And it is fit it ſhould be obſerved, that theſe preſent Oppoſers not only acknowledg'd the People, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> to be a true Church whilſt in this Practice (which I deny any Church to be that continues in the World's Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and that they have frequently ſuggeſted us on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be Retainers of; But that they have received heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Refreſhment by thoſe <hi>Prayers,</hi> that have been offered up by uncovered Heads: And that God ſhould ſend forth ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> ſo richly furniſhed, and rarely qualified, by the Divine Power and Wiſdom of God a few years before, as the <hi>Author of the Hat</hi> confeſſeth, and that in, their Performance of Worſhip to God, they ſhould be worldly, and vainly Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious, can be no wayes conſiſtent. And I do here appeal to all ſober Perſons, if after ſo large a Terſtimony, given to the People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as a true Church, and her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Worſhip as powerful and pure, before ever this Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation came forth, it could be any thing ſolid, ſeaſonable or edifying to introduce or trouble the Church with that Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which they acknowledge She was Bleſt, and Proſperous without.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But again, it denotes and ſignifies the Difference that is between Worſhip to God, and Miniſtry to Man; there is not equal Homage, indeed none at all in declaring God's Will to Man, but the other is all matter of pure Homage, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this Difference by ſome due and ſuitable Poſture, is ſo far from being unlawful, that the contrary is very condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is never to be thought reaſonable by People not out of their Senses, at leaſt upon our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> Principles, that a Man ſhould be moved to Pray, and yet in that Motion not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſhew it. What! would they have a Man, when he is moved to pray, wait for another Motion to be led to diſcover it? But above all the reſt, how do they that ſtand with their Hats on, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their Unity with him, that prayes (as they confeſs a Man may by the Spirit of the Lord) with his Hat off? I ſay, what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93328:14"/>
greater Token do they give of their Joyning with ſuch Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then the <hi>Publican</hi> or <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who by that very Poſture teſtifie their Diſlike. But yet further, ſuppoſe a <hi>Hat-Man</hi> be moved to Pray with his Hat off, as they confeſs he may, what becomes of the reſt of that Opinion in the Meeting? If they pull it off meerly as having Unity with his Prayer, then they are gone; for that is our Ground, who ſay, that Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Prayer and Geſture muſt go together. If they ſay, it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them not to pull it off, Two things will follow; <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Spirit of the Lord moveth People in the ſame Meeting, at the ſame inſtant of time, and in one and the ſame Duty, unto two Contrary things. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That they may have Unity with the Prayer, and not with the Geſture; with one Motion, and not the other. That they have Unity with the Prayer, and give, and wrap up their Spirits in the preſent ſenſe that's ſtirring in the Aſſembly, with his that is the Mouth, without an extra-ordinary Impulſe to pray with him in their own Spirits; yet require ſuch a Motion to Joyn with the Geſture: ſo that they can pray with the Man moved, but not pull off their Hat with the Man ſo moved. The Confuſion, Contradiction and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of this Imagination ought forever to Juſtifie the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Seaſonable, Solid and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Proceedings againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducers and Abettors of it; for a Contradiction in Geſture, when Geſture ſtands upon Motion, is (proportionably) as real a Reſiſtance againſt the Spirit, and committing of Diſorder in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſemblies, as in Matter of Doctrine, or any other eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The generality of the Friends in the Nation renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it; where I cannot but take an Opportunity to defend a Paſſage in a private, Letter writ by me, upon the Entreaty of one of <hi>John Perrot</hi>'s Diſciples, in much Kindneſs, to ſatisfie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him, and cited by the envious <hi>Author of Tyranny and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie Detected,</hi> pag. 25.</p>

not in that, but in accounting themſelves a True Church: Theſe are not my very words; a Diſingenuity, if I am not miſtaken this <hi>Author</hi> wrote once almoſt a whole Book againſt; however, I abide by the Paſſage: For if Chriſt bid individuals tell the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; yet the <hi>Church</hi> has no more <hi>Diſcerning</hi> or <hi>Judgements</hi> then they had themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Appeal, &amp; which can't be better'd by it away with <hi>Reaſon</hi>: If in the multitude of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors there be ſafety, reſpecting Worldly Matters, why not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Spiritual Matters? ſuppoſing, as we ever did, that Gods Power, Spirit &amp; preſence preſide in any ſuch Church, Body or Aſſembly. This is more then the Cavil deſerves, but I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expreſs my mind more fully for the Readers Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This Innovation brought with it Diviſion, inſtead of Unity; Confuſion, inſtead of Order; Heart-burnings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Love, and diverted the minds of ſome from the more weighty things of God's living and ſpiritual Law.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Had it been never ſo Innocent, it coſt more then it was worth, and their inſiſting ſo much upon it to the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church's Concord, was no ſmall Evidence of the Wrongneſs of that Spirit, which introduced and maintained it. This ſhall ſufficiently rebuke and judge, both it and them, that it added nothing to Life and Salva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, nor to the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Body of Chriſt, <hi>which is the End of every true Motion</hi>; for it carryed neither interiour nor exteriour Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Service or Benefit in the leaſt, either to Perſons in their own Particulars, or to the Church in general.</p>
               <p>And whereas they frequently have accuſed the Body of our Friends, which ſtill remains, as they once confeſt, the Body of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93328:15"/>
Chriſt, of being guilty of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cuſtoms, in not being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Irreverence and that the Minds of People, were not yet inwardly and ſpiritually exerciſed in Worſhip, it is evident, that their new-fangled Practice, Diſſent about it, and continual Defence of it, did more draw out the Minds of ſome people, and exerciſe and perplex them about Poſtures and Geſtures, then ever they were before: ſo that what they falſly charge upon the Church is their own proper Character. Our Friends prudent Stop to this troubleſome and endleſs ſort of Innovation, deſerves none of thoſe <hi>Hard Names</hi> theſe <hi>ſcurrilous Libels</hi> give both them and their Proceedings.</p>
               <p>But they object ſomething <hi>G. F.</hi> and my ſelf have writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hat-Honour,</hi> as that we ſhould repute it <hi>an Earthly, vain, and mean thing,</hi>

                  <hi>minded only of Men in the Fall; that if pulling off the Hat were true Honouring or Reſpecting, Vile Perſons would be the moſt Civil; Real Reſpect is a more ſubſtantial Thing, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by Obedience.</hi> This our <hi>Adverſary</hi> quotes out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>True Honour among the Jews</hi>; and mine, intituled, <hi>No Croſs, no Crown</hi>; But they forgot to be ſo ingenuous, or on purpoſe would not be ſo juſt, as to tell People, that we writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>fallen Honour of the Hat to Men.</hi> Becauſe we deny it to Men, muſt we therefore deny it to God? No; <hi>but we therefore deny it to Men, becauſe we give it only to God, as one of thoſe Geſtures, which outwardly diſtinguiſhes Worſhip to God from Miniſtry to Man.</hi> But this is their Drift &amp; Ground of their citing thoſe Paſſages, <hi>that if it be ſo Mean and Earthly a thing, to pull off the Hat to Man, how, comes it ſo Eminent a Geſture in Worſhip, and why not eſteemed as earthly and empty a thing in reſpect to Worſhip as Civil Honour?</hi> I think I give the Force of their Objection, and ſhall as eaſily anſwer it.</p>
               <p>That which gives <hi>Weight</hi> to any <hi>Geſture,</hi> is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> inducing to it, and both the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Frame</hi> of the Mind in uſing of it.

Paſſage in a Letter to <hi>Je Perrot</hi> from <hi>R. Hubberthorn.</hi> 
                  <q>Then no ſuch Reaſonings had we had, if ſo be, the <hi>Free Spirit</hi> of the Lord had been minded.<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 24</note> which is not to be limited, neither to the keeping on the Hat, nor off the Hat in time of Prayer.</q> But what adds this to their Cauſe, in Defence of which they brought it? Who go about to limit the Spirit, and not we, as <hi>R. H.</hi> alſo ſayes; for our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to be limited by the Spirit, and not to limit it, or, to out-run it. I hope, none will infer from thence, that Men ought to keep their <hi>Hats on</hi>; Or, that the ſame Spirit would lead to thoſe contrary Geſtures, as ſay ſome of <hi>J. Perrot's</hi> Followers: For <hi>R. H.</hi> meant nothing leſs; but he was ſure, if they had kept to that free Spirit (that had already limited to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the pulling it off) <hi>there would not have been ſuch Reaſonings about keeping of it on, or off</hi>; and why? becauſe they would have felt a Pre-concluſion, which would have ſetled them out of the Reach of the Bondage that Spirit of Deluſion had brought them into: For the Liberty of the Spirit ſtands not in being moved to contrary things, that is <hi>Ranteriſm</hi>; but in being freed from every high Thought, and exalted Imagination, to abide in the Order of the Goſpel. But our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> who can at times, and for his own Ends engage for any Cauſe, tells us <hi>J. Perrot's</hi> Defence, that he <hi>did not enjoyn the Practice; for he left all to the Free, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit,</hi> pag. 24. But after this, our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> if he would have defended <hi>J. P.</hi> to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he ſhould not have told us, pag. 32, 33. <hi>that J.</hi> Perrot <hi>had received Command againſt it from the Lord God of Heaven and Earth in his Captivity at</hi> Rome, <hi>to teſtify againſt the Cuſtom and Tradition of Taking off the Hat by Men, when they go to pray to God</hi>: And the Truth is, he did at other times call it a <hi>Romiſh Tradition.</hi> But what follows from theſe two Paſſages that ſo greatly juſtle at one another? Does not the firſt imply, that a Man may Lawfully pull off the Hat in Prayer; and the latter expreſly judge it as a Tradition of Men? Either his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was Falſe, or he was Deceitful in his Anſwer to our Friends; For that a Man may be left to his Liberty, whether he ſhould practiſe the Traditions of Men in the Worſhip of God (upon <hi>J. Perrot's</hi> Pretences to Divine Motions altogether
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93328:17"/>
in Worſhip) is the height of all Contradiction; yet this is the Doctrine of <hi>J. Perrot,</hi> as we have it delivered to us by his <hi>Apologizer:</hi> To give Liberty to pull it off, or put it on, as it was with People to do, and yet that he was commanded of God to teſtifie againſt it poſitively and generally, as a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man; As if People might uſe, nay, be moved of God, to perform in his Worſhip any of the Traditions of Men, which God himſelf had given expreſs Sentence againſt. It is not ſhort of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> it ſelf. And for Our Friends, that is, <hi>G. F. G. W.</hi> and others, which this Man ſayes, owned <hi>J. Perrot's</hi> Motion for <hi>Rome,</hi> and counted him a good Friend, p. 32. They do aver that they denyed that Motion, and never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted him. However it be, this <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> vowed to our Diſgrace, beſtirs him ſelf not a little in Defence of <hi>J. Perrot</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as if <hi>firſt</hi> he loved the Hat on in Time of Prayer, which he denyes in it ſelf; <hi>Secondly,</hi> as if he believed and allowed of Motions, which he both denyes and ſcorns; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as if he liked a true <hi>Quaker,</hi> and was not ſo much diſpleaſed at the Light, as at Peoples Leaving or Confining it in its Leadings and Requirings; Who by his great Envy to our Perſons, ſhows his Hate to True <hi>Quakers</hi>; and by his baſe Concluſion from the Pretences of both Parties to have been led to a Contrary thing by the Light within, That the Light is a kind of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Uncertain Thing; and waiting to be ordered by it, a very Dubious piece of Buſineſs, to the Diſgrace of Chriſt's Light; Reviling then, as well the one Sort as the other, and bringing his Blow well nigh as hard upon the <hi>Hat-Men</hi> as upon us, ſee pag. 23, 24, 25, 71, and ult. In which the Drift of his Buſineſs is to drive People off from the Leadings of the Light, inſtead of Pleading on the behalf of theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> being led into that Practice by it, as he vainly doth, p. 32, 33. Let Diſingenuous <hi>W. Mucklow,</hi> and Furious <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> ſee to what paſs they have brought their Affairs, who under the Pretence of proving the <hi>Quakers</hi> Apoſtacy from the Teachings of the Light, have furniſht a Man with Complaints againſt us, who could ſo little diſſemble his Diſ-like againſt the <hi>Principle</hi> it ſelf, as to conclude <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty, Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that very Aſſertion about the Light's Teaching, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93328:17"/>
the People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the beginning made, and is by this <hi>Adverſary</hi> in other places, on theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> account ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleaded for. Let them glory in this Man's Endeavours, if they will; Their wicked <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and great <hi>Trachery</hi> are herein manifeſt beyond what may at this time be ſaid by us: They loved the Motions of the Principle at an odd rate that ſet a Man to defend them that is an Enemy to them. His Concluſions prove what I ſaid in mine Introductoction, that it was againſt the <hi>True</hi> Quakers <hi>and their ancient confeſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he chiefly levelled his Scoffs, Nick-Names, Reflections and groſs Perverſions, and not meerly againſt us as Falſe</hi> Quakers, <hi>or Perſons gone from our firſt Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove this, behold how, and why he triumphs! <hi>That our Principle admits of no Means whereby to diſcern one immediate Teaching from another.</hi> Perrot <hi>ſayes one thing, and</hi> Fox <hi>another; Who is in the right</hi>? or to that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It would have done well if <hi>W. M.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> had anſwered this Objection, before they furniſht him to plead their Cauſe and defend them to be in the Right, from thoſe Motions their own <hi>Apologiſt</hi> denyes any Certainty to; and I may now take Occaſion to ask him, why he is ſo peremptory in his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of us to be in the Wrong, who denyes any Certainty of Judgment of either ſide? How comes he ſo Certain in Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Juſtifying? Partial Man! But no greater Evidence can well be given of the Wrongneſs of <hi>J. Perrot</hi>'s Spirit, then has been already related; viz. <hi>The Diſturbance of the Church; The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſs of the Thing; The Scandalous Laps and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy of himſelf and ſeveral of his Followers, and the Judgment others Zealouſly paſt againſt themſelves whoſe Simplicity had been betrayed.</hi> The Fruits teſtifie what Spirit it was, though, upon our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary's ſaying That there is no inward Teſt or Tryal of Spirits, at leaſt implying ſo much, he contradicts Scripture, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues the Gift of God; For he had as good to ſay, <hi>That a Wrong Spirit, covered with fair and undeniable Pretences, is not diſcernable by the Light and Spirit of God within; A Man may be Wrong within, and Right without, have the exact Form, but not the Power of Godlineſs.</hi> What can try Spirits, but the Spirit? No Writing can tell me a Wrong from a Right Spirit in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93328:18"/>
ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it may deſcribe good and bad Fruits, and from ſuch Actions Men may by a Writing deſcribe the Right from the Wrong; But what gives to reliſh, taſt or ſavour a Wrong Spirit in Sheeps Cloathing beſide the Heavenly Inſtinct of the Divine Nature? As People are turned to that they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Spiritual Man judgeth all things,</hi> (that is, of right he may) <hi>and is judged of no Man</hi> (that is, not diſcerningly of the meer Natural Men) And as the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Man's Diſcerning is from the Spirit that ſearcheth out the deep things of God; ſo is God the Judge and Law giver to his People under this Diſpenſation. If the Goſpel-Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be in Spirit, True <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt have an Inward Taſt and Senſe of one anothers Spirits; and what gives to ſavour aright <hi>at the ſame time gives to reliſh a Wrong Spirit.</hi> The ſame <hi>Objection</hi> he makes againſt the Light may be made againſt <hi>the Spirit,</hi> (which is but another Name for the ſame Principle) and I hope, he will not dare to ſay that any Confuſion can follow upon holding that <hi>Men under the Goſpel ought to be led by it</hi>: Yet, this granted, ſuppoſe Men pretending to be led by the Spirit, to be gone from the Spirit; or that two equally pretending to be guided by it, differ, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> what ſhould determine? No <hi>Writings</hi> of the Old Teſtament could, at leaſt without <hi>Meanings</hi>; and the ſame Difficulty lyes about the Meanings of <hi>Scripture</hi> as about being led by the Spirit. In this Caſe what ſhall be done? Surely the Spirit muſt not be upbraided nor branded: Neither will it follow, <hi>That there is no Judge</hi>; for Chriſt is the great Judge, appointed of God. the Spiritual great Prophet that ſpeaks from Heaven, and in his own time will give Judgment to the View of all Men. In the mean while he ſatisfies the Minds of thoſe who are truly led by his Spirit; and Withering, Decay, Murmuring, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and finally Apoſtaſy will follow upon the Pretenders as is fulfilled in the preſent <hi>Judaſſes.</hi> This hath been largely argued elſewhere, yet I was not willing to let this Paſſage of our Enemies paſs unconſidered, which indeed is the Strength of his Book, and what the ableſt of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> can ſay againſt us an this account.</p>
               <p>I have proceeded thus far more particularly in Defence of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93328:18"/>
the <hi>Church,</hi> againſt the <hi>Apoſtate Adverſaries</hi> and their <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> about the Argument by them made about the <hi>Hat,</hi> and thoſe Diſcords that iſſued; In which I hope, I have not exceeded the Bounds of Truth and Moderation.</p>
               <p>For the latter <hi>Objection,</hi> which is directed not ſo much againſt the <hi>Body</hi> of our Friends, as <hi>a ſelect Number of Miniſters and Elders devoted,</hi> as he falſly and ſcoffingly ſuggeſts, <hi>to the Promotion of</hi> G. F's <hi>Authority and Intereſt,</hi> I can with all Clearneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and that in the Name of many Brethren, give this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. F.</hi> I would have all to know, <hi>ſeeks not Himſelf,</hi> but Chriſt, and as becomes a true Apoſtle, and Servant of his Lord and Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt, Early and Late, in Seaſon and out of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with inceſſant Pains and Care (not being Burthenſom unto any) endeavours to promote the Work of God in the Earth; and is ſo <hi>far from Lording it over any,</hi> that he daily ſerves all for the Truth's ſake, thinking no <hi>Labour</hi> too great, nor <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> too mean, whereby he may be Serviceable to any, in what concerns their Eternal Well-fare; and this ſome of theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> muſt needs know. He has approved himſelf, and ſtill doth among us, to be a <hi>Man of God,</hi> and <hi>a True Prophet of the Lord</hi>; and as ſuch, we do Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him, and the Rage of Men ſhall not Diſ-ſettle us from our Senſe and Regard of him, who ſeeks not himſelf, nor his own things, but the Things of God, that Chriſt, and his Power alone may be exalted in the Hearts of all People, and all Fleſh humbled; and for this alone are all publick Labourers of Value with, our Friends, and no otherwiſe Reſpected or Regarded then in the Lord, which is <hi>not Tyranny,</hi> but <hi>Duty</hi>: Wherefore thoſe Terms, of <hi>Foxonian, King George Fox, Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onian Leaven,</hi> G.

                  <hi>God's Free-Men,</hi> and True <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being with him Baptized <hi>by One Spirit into One Body</hi>; the Unity of which theſe ſmiting <hi>Apoſtates</hi> and their abuſive <hi>Libeller</hi> can never break.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93328:19"/>I ſhall touch upon their Aggravations about not <hi>Marrying, Burying,</hi> &amp;c. before I come to thoſe other Reflections made againſt <hi>G.F.</hi> our <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>My ſelf,</hi> and all before I end my Share in this Re-joynder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That we deny them Trading, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, Burying, and all Eccleſiaſtical &amp; Civil Priviledges to thoſe that diſſent from us.</hi> p. 7. Theſe were the Aggravations I before promiſed to obſerve.</p>
               <p>But alas! What ſhall we ſay to a Man thus Hardy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be Wicked, that he may render us ſo? Did we even forbid Men <hi>Trading,</hi> or endeavour to take People off from Trading with them? <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> can ſay no ſuch thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Lying; for ſeveral have lovingly frequented his Shop, ſince he Enviouſly viſited and diſturbed our Meetings: And how many do we daily trade with, that are not of us, in Love and full Aſſurance of their Honeſty.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Marrying,</hi> I referred the Author of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> to the Apoſtle's Dehortation, <hi>Be ye not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequally Yoaked together.</hi> It ſeems, if we cannot own Perſons to be of us, that are not of us, we muſt be abuſed. This made the preſent <hi>Apologizer</hi> (if I am not out of my Gueſs) Angry and Enraged with us at firſt. 'Tis not meer <hi>Talking</hi> of Chriſt, and hammering out a few <hi>Notions</hi> in the meer Strength of Man's Will and Wiſdom, that makes a <hi>True Chriſtian</hi>; therefore we could not receive him for our <hi>Sect-Maſter,</hi> that angers him. And for <hi>Marriage,</hi> we cannot have Unity with any in that ſolemn Performance of Marrying, who are acted by a Wrong Spirit, and ſo gone out of the Union of the Body of Friends: We do not deny them that are ſo Married, to be Married at all, as this Enemy would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, though to be Married in the Unity we can never own them.</p>
               <p>As to our denying of <hi>Burial</hi> unto ſuch <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> my words in the Book, called, <hi>The Spirit of Alexander the Copper-Smith Rebuked,</hi> carry no ſuch unnatural Senſe. Two things I deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (1.) <hi>That we therefore denyed them a Burial, becauſe we ſhould
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93328:19"/>
alwayes refuſe it as of us, whilſt they continued in that Diſſenting Spirit from us.</hi> (2.) <hi>That we <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped their Property.</hi> To the firſt, ſayes our Adverſary, <hi>The</hi> (Quakers) <hi>would not suffer ſuch to ſtink above Ground, but he ſhould be buried, not among the</hi> Catholicks; <hi>but as</hi> Hereticks <hi>in</hi> Spaine <hi>or</hi> Italy, p. 19.</p>
               <p>Behold the Candor of this Interpreter! What a ſtrange Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement has he made of my Saying? much more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Carriage of that ſort of <hi>Catholicks</hi> (he likens us to) againſt ſuch pretended <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as the poor <hi>Waldenſes</hi> then, we do in the Caſe of Burial.</p>
               <p>I ſay again, That as our Friends intended upon their firſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of a <hi>Burying Place,</hi> that their Dead Bodies ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I would fain know, if this <hi>Adverſary</hi> would obſerve no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in this Caſe? or what Injury there is done, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Difference, <hi>when Dead,</hi> which was obſerved by the deceaſt Party himſelf, <hi>when alive?</hi> For the <hi>Property</hi> that he ſayes ſome of them have, 'tis true, and was never denyed; but that we uſurpt it, we did and do reject as a Slander: They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſired their part of the Collection that bought it, nor did we ever refuſe to repay it, but are ready to be quit with them when they will; a Perverſe Apoſtatized Generation! For <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Priviledges,</hi> I know not what he means; and thoſe Scoffs ill become a Man that pretends to Religion: Such Priviledges, as are the peculiar Right of every true Member of Chriſt's Church, it muſt be confeſt, that ſuch Starters aſide from the Primitive Fellowſhip of it, <hi>do deprive themſelves of Church-Priviledges</hi>; we don't. But this, ſayes he, <hi>is more then any beſide the</hi> Papiſt <hi>dare pretend to; the</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>or</hi> Church of England <hi>challenges no ſuch Power,</hi> p. 5. But he that has ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to tell ſo many Falſe Things of us, may dare to beſtow

one upon her, eſpecially when it is conſidered, that he is a <hi>Concealed Perſon,</hi> and may be <hi>Falſe and Baſe with Security.</hi> Does not the <hi>Church of England,</hi> both Excommunicate, and ſtir up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt ſuch as diſſent from her in meer Circumſtances? Does not the long Difference between her and the ancient <hi>Puritans, Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents, Baptiſts,</hi> and Us more particularly, ſufficiently Diſprove that Bold, Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But we pretend not to Imitate any; but really act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Underſtanding and Senſe which God given us in theſe things, and in which we commend our ſelves to him, being herein willing to abide his Judgment.</p>
               <p>To the Reſt of thoſe Cruelties he makes us guilty of, he doth, with the Author of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat,</hi> charge us <hi>with Pulling down,</hi>

               <p>But, to ſay nothing of his Ill-Language, my Appeal ſtands as it did; and as before, ſo now I will put it between Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and Moderate Men, if ever we ſo uſed any Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Inquirer, or Oppoſer?

               <p>For <hi>Francis Chadwell,</hi> he is a Man of no Conſcience, nor Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, in what relates to us; I my ſelf have known him groſly guilty both of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Tipling:</hi> No frothy Stager is leſs to be regarded in Religion, then this Man's Witneſs, <hi>a Light, Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, Taunting, Tumultuous Perſon</hi>; who after an Hundred So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Confutations, One of which had been enough to ſtrike an Ingenuous Man to the Heart, has continued to Bawl and Diſquiet our Meetings, time after time: His Aim hath been to raiſe up an Envious and Scoffing Spirit in People againſt us, Jeering, Laughing, Houting, with ſuch Unſeemly Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as wholely unbefit him for a Witneſs againſt us; He had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93328:20"/>
as good as confeſt, that he has been Hired by ſome Profeſſors to Diſturb us, and told me, <hi>If I would give him Five Hundred Pounds he would be a</hi> Quaker <hi>too</hi>; yet, this is our <hi>Socinian Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's Serious, Conſcientious Inquirer, or Oppoſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He alſo brings in one <hi>William King,</hi> whom he ſayes, <hi>We Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of our Gallery in</hi> Grace-Church <hi>Street, with ſuch Violence, that he hath ſcarce felt the Stairs, but that he hath often felt our Cruel Hands, witneſs</hi> G.

               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, I have no great Acquaintance with the Man; but <hi>firſt,</hi> deny that ever he was Haled out of <hi>Grace-Church</hi> Street, or any where elſe; but it may ſo happen, that he offering to keep the Meeting when ended by our Friends, the People preſſing out, and he ſpeaking, might bear him away with a Croud, which, hath fallen out to many that have been Speakers, and not Oppoſers: perhaps ſome diſturbed and hindred of Hearing, may on their own Account have ſhoven him, or put him by; what's that to us?</p>
               <p>For G. <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Pinching him, it is like the reſt, full of Slander; He is known to be a Man of more Temperance and Command of himſelf, if he had been provoked. 'Tis true, He took him by the Sleeve to turn him to a Looking-Glaſs, that he might behold his Envious and Paſſionate Countenance, as <hi>G.

               <p>That he was a Priſoner is confeſſed; that we Refuſed him to be among us, is denyed: But that we were not in Unity with him, we are not afraid to own. I know not that I ever ſpoak to him but once, and that was in <hi>New-Gate,</hi> being a Priſoner my ſelf; and if he will ſpeak Truth, he can ſay nothing hard of me. For <hi>G.

               <p>
                  <hi>But we gave out a Paper againſt</hi> John Pennyman <hi>when he was in Priſon,</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">pag. 16.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and would not ſpare that grave, ancient Gentle-Woman</hi> Ann Mud, <hi>who being MOVED to ſpeak a few Words,</hi> T.

               <p>For his <hi>ancient, grave Gentle-Woman</hi> (as he calls her) ſhe hath been ſo Unhappy as through her Exceſs of Affection to <hi>J. Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to be a Sharer with him in his perverſe Out-Cryes againſt

Is he angry with us for reſiſting <hi>Ann Mud</hi>'s MOTION, who himſelf, p. 32, 33, 71. denyes the Certainty of any ſuch thing? but Envy blinds Men. We ſhall alſo grant that we are the Men whom the Eternal God from time to time raiſed to teſtifie againſt the <hi>Hireling Teachers</hi> that took Money for that which was not Bread, but were like Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing, devoured the Flock, and made a Prey of the People; and God hath bleſſed us in that Service, for before a Gathering, there was to be a Scattering: And God made us Inſtrumental to turn People from Darkneſs to Light, from the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God, <hi>by directing their Minds to the Gift of his Holy Light and Spirit, which diſcovers the Deeds of Darkneſs, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the World of Sin, revealeth the Mind and Will of God, and gives Power to the Creature that believes in it, to obey and do it.</hi>

Religion, committed many years ago, Examin'd, Judg'd, and they Forgiven, upon Repentance, by the Lord, and therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again by us; and all this done with Deſign to Blaſt our Credit, Diſgrace the Way we profeſs (though they were no way concerned to meddle or interpoſe) To do all this, I ſay, is not to be acted by the Spirit of God, but That, of an Accurſed <hi>Ham,</hi> and Treacherous <hi>Judas</hi>; and the Lord will avenge our Cauſe, we doubt not, in due time.</p>
               <p>But an Hainous <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is laid to the Memory of <hi>Joſiah Coale,</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">pag. 19.</note> by this Angry Agent, in behalf of theſe <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi>; and that is, a Paſſage in a Letter writ ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him, in his Life-time to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>That G. F. <hi>was the Father of many Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is in this? Is it any more then to ſay, That by him, as an Inſtrument in the Hand of God, People of many Nations have been by him begotten to God? Was not <hi>Paul</hi> a Father of many Nations, who begot the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that were <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> that were <hi>Latins?</hi> But further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſe Life hath reached through us thy Children, even to the Iſles afar off, to the begetting of many again unto a lively Hope, for which Generations to come ſhall call thee Bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very well; And what <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> lodges in theſe Words! Is not that which is the Life of one Good Man the Life of another? Were not the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old by One Spirit baptized into One Body? What Life <hi>G. F.</hi> had was from Chriſt Jeſus, and it was no other Life <hi>J. Coale</hi> writ of: And I hope, <hi>The Life of Chriſt is one in All</hi>; and who can limit it? And <hi>Joſiah Coals,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were Children in the Senſe afore-mentioned; and that Life through thoſe Children, by him (inſtrumentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, did reach to thoſe <hi>Iſles</hi> afar off, unto which he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel. <hi>Paul</hi> reached to the Churches, though afar off, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 10. He was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Spirit, though Abſent in Body; for, <hi>I verily, as Abſent in Body,</hi> BUT PRESENT IN SPIRIT, <hi>have judged already, as though I were preſent — In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered, and</hi> MY SPIRIT <hi>in the Power of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, caſt forth</hi> (and taken in too upon Repentance, without

And why ſhall not Generations to come <hi>call an</hi> Apoſtle <hi>Bleſſed</hi>; and bleſs the Name of the Lord for him, reſpecting the Benefit any ſuch one might be in God's Power to a People? Is not the Memory of the Juſt Bleſſed? <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7. And did not the Lord by his Prophet ſay of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>I will make thee an Eternal Excellency, and the Joy of many Generations?</hi> Iſa 60.57. What if <hi>J. Coale</hi> had ſo ſpoak of <hi>G. F.</hi> and God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> now? Would it have been <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>? But theſe Err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God, like the <hi>Jews</hi> of old.</p>

And is it notwithſtanding <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to ſtand in it, or teſtifie of one that doth ſtand in it, that he doth ſo ſtand? Oh the Idle Oppoſition! but great Envy of our Enemies!

of the</hi> KINGDOM, Mat. 13.28. <hi>The</hi> KINGDOM <hi>of God is within,</hi> Luke 17.20. <hi>The Saints ſhall</hi> JUDGE <hi>the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.2 3. <hi>But ye are a</hi> ROYAL <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 9.2. <hi>And thou</hi> (the Lamb) <hi>haſt made us unto our God</hi> KINGS <hi>and</hi> PRIESTS, <hi>and we ſhall</hi> RAIGN <hi>on the Earth,</hi> Rev. 5.10. <hi>And I appoint unto you a</hi> KINGDOM, <hi>as my Father hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto me, that ye may Eat and Drink at my Table in the Kingdom, and</hi> JUDGE <hi>on Thrones the Twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, Luke 22.29, 30. <hi>It is the Father's good Pleaſure to give you a</hi> KINGDOM, Luke 12.23. <hi>who hath tranſlated us into the</hi> KINGDOM <hi>of his dear Son,</hi> 1 Col. 13.

Where let it be noted, that by all theſe Titles and Priviledges, we only mean and underſtand, <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over, Not Bodies nor Souls, Not Fleſh nor Blood</hi>; but in the Senſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Principalities and Powers, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Darkneſs of this World, and Spiritual Wickedneſſes in High Places,</hi> which center in the Inviſible, Dark Power of the God of the World, that ſince the Beginning hath drawn and acted Man, out of God's Counſel and Power in which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtands: <hi>For though we walk in the Fleſh or Body, we do not War after the Fleſh; for the Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal, but Mighty through God, to the pulling down Strong Holds, caſting down Imaginations, and every high Thing, that exalts it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4, 5.

                  <hi>Weapons,</hi> ſo our <hi>Kingdom</hi> is not Carnal, but Spiritual; not of this World, but that which is without End; and of this we are not aſhamed.</p>
               <p>It may not be unſeaſonable to take Notice of that Paſſage in his Book ſo often mentioned, eagerly inſiſted upon,<note rend="inter">p. 19, 20, 21, 29.</note> and aggravated to the height of <hi>Ananias</hi>'s <hi>Belying the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> viz That G. Fox, <hi>this Great Prophet</hi> (as he in Abuſe calls him) <hi>ſhould break open and alter the Contents of</hi> John Whitehead<hi>'s Letter, which (as he ſaid) was writ in the Name of the Lord, and that to a quite contrary Senſe; making the Letter to judge thoſe that kept the Hat on, whereas</hi> J, W. <hi>therein juſtified both, thoſe that kept it off, or on. Thus,</hi> ſaith our Adverſary, <hi>doth</hi> G. Fox <hi>belye both</hi> John Whitehead <hi>and the Holy Spirit of God, and that knowingly.</hi> He proceeds, <hi>Oh Prodigious Impudence! He that counterfeits any Man's Name in a Matter of any Concernment deſerves to be expoſed on the</hi> PILLARY, AND TO LOSE HIS EARS; HOW MUCH GREATER <note n="*" rend="inter">Blood! Blood! thou ſeekeſt. O Envious Man!</note> PUNISHMENT DOTH HE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERVE <hi>that Counterfeits both the Name of God and Man, in a Matter of Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. This,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is the Courſe that</hi> G. F. <hi>took to make his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions to be obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is the Courſe more truly to make the Impiety of this <hi>Adverſary</hi> more Notorious. For firſt, <hi>G. Fox</hi> never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his Letter, nor made any Alteration in it at all, that I dare affirm in ſo many Words; much leſs that he belyed the Holy Spirit; and leaſt of all, that he did it willingly. I perceive by his Concluſion, he acknowledges that the Holy Ghoſt as really moved in <hi>J. Whitehead</hi> as in <hi>Peter,</hi> contrary to his own Principle. Any thing will they All grant that they may Slander or Injure us in the Minds of the People. How knows he it was a True Motion? Doth he not deny it may be known? If ſo then, how dare he be ſo poſitive in the Cenſure of <hi>G. Fox</hi>? Will he make the Motion Uncertain, and yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly judge <hi>G. F.</hi> for a <hi>Forger,</hi> who was yet Innocent? I leave it to the <hi>Reader,</hi> what to call this part of his Tale. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>J. Whitehead</hi> gave Power by Letter at that time to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93328:25"/>
Brethren of London, <hi>to ſuperviſe and alter it, as they ſhould ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient:</hi> and no otherwiſe was <hi>G. F.</hi> concerned in it, then as one aſſenting with other of our Friends, that according to Power given and their beſt Underſtanding, did alter it for the better, and herein did <hi>J. W.</hi> teſtifie his Unity and Fellowſhip; <hi>for the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets:</hi> So that what was done, was no more then what <hi>J. Whitehead</hi> left Power to do, and which the Scripture juſtifies. Wherefore <hi>Prodigious Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> belongs not to <hi>G. F.</hi> but this hardy <hi>Adverſary</hi>; and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Cruelty, Perſecution, if not Murder too, is he guilty of that would have him not only <hi>Pillary'd, and loſe his Ears, but his Life too,</hi> or ſomething very near a kin to it. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed page 33. where he charges us to be <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> and that ſuch ought to Dye by the Law of God in former times; The Conſequence is plainer then his <hi>Power</hi> to execute it. <hi>Oh the Mercies! Oh the Forgiveneſs of theſe exceeding Meek, Suffering, Bruiſed Little Ones!</hi> as they would have as think, <hi>But, Oh Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Blood thirſty Generation</hi>! who have endeavoured what in you lies, to betray with your <hi>Treacherous Kiſs of pretended Love to our Souls,</hi> our Faith, Reputations and Lives too, into the Hands of ſome Bloody-minded <hi>Jews,</hi> who are not of the Circumciſion in Spirit, but luſt againſt thoſe that are, that they may be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up againſt us; But God will reckon with you and them too, for theſe things.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Adverſary</hi> takes an Occaſion to faſten a <hi>Lye</hi> upon a Paper ſet forth in the Name of the <hi>Quakers</hi>; but he ſayes,<note rend="inter">pag. 29.</note> writ chiefly by <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> in ſaying, <hi>That we have paid our Taxes and other Dues more then any People, according to our Abilities. When</hi> (ſayes our Adverſary) <hi>their Neighbours know all over</hi> England <hi>there are (at leaſt) ſome Taxes or Aſſeſſments, which they have peremptorily refuſed.</hi> But why muſt we be branded for <hi>Lyars</hi> becauſe of that Saying, or our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> baſe Aggravation? I do affirm, <hi>That we have been overſeſt more then any</hi>; and <hi>Paying</hi> thoſe Extream Aſſeſſments gives good Ground for <hi>Saying</hi> what we did. But indeed, ſome <hi>Hat-Spirits</hi> perhaps could not ſay ſo; but why? <hi>Becauſe ſome of them are ſo leavened into another Spirit, that they almoſt queſtion the Payment of any, as</hi> M. Boreman, <hi>now called</hi> M. Pennyman, <hi>did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93328:25"/>I muſt not be plainer, leaſt the <hi>Cabal</hi> further repreſent me one that expoſes Perſon to the Laſh of <note n="*" rend="inter">But is not this to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us <hi>Obnoxious to the Government</hi>?

                  </note> Government. Wherein we can pay we do, what ever they come for, and in ſome Caſes wherein we cannot, anſwer their Demands for Chriſt's Peaceable GOSPEL ſake. They commonly Take three times the Value, ſeldom, if ever Retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning any again; But this our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary calls no <hi>Paying</hi>: Sure I am, it is <hi>Looſing</hi> more then our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> dare adventure; for if I miſtake not, he can ſend out all thoſe things rather then ſuffer, though perhaps againſt his Conſcience alſo.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>but,</hi> if we will believe him, <hi>there is ſuch an Arrogant, Imperious and Audacious Paper given forth by</hi> R. Farnſworth, A. Parker, G. Whitehead, J. Coale,<note rend="inter">p. 29, 30, 31, 32.</note> J. Whitehead, T. Loe, S. Criſp, T. Green, T. Moon, T. Brigs, and J. Parks, <hi>as he thinks, was ever given forth by Mortals.</hi> A Charge too great, and a Reflection ſo ſharp, that it had need be one of the worſt Papers that was ever writ. Now let us hear what it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They allow not ſuch to have Dominion in the Church, who exalt themſelves above the Body of Good and Ancient Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, what hateful thing did they deliver in this wholeſome Chriſtian Saying? It ſeems, this Enemy of God, and true Righteouſneſs, would have liked us better, <hi>if Bad Friends had been ſuffered to exerciſe the Dominion over the Body of Good and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Friends.</hi> But he ſtarts out thus, <hi>That by the Body of Good and Ancient Friends is meant</hi> G. Fox <hi>and his Adherents</hi>; which ſort of Interpretation well becomes ſuch a <hi>Caballiſtick Writer</hi>; for after thoſe Allowances, I will miſrender the beſt Cauſe, Pretences or Actions in the World. It is an arrant Falſhood: He was then far from them; Neither had they him in their Eye in doing it, but God's Honour, and the Churches Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93328:26"/>2. <hi>That ſuch as are not in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with the Miniſtry and Body, have no Goſpel-Authority to be Judges in the Church: And that it is abominable Pride, when any Particular will not yield</hi> TO THE WITNESS OF GOD IN FRIENDS.</p>
               <p>But what is the Matter with our <hi>Adverſary</hi>? Hath he loſt his Wits that he makes this ſo Criminal? Are any to be Judges in that Church they have no Unity with? and amongſt the Miniſtry they deny, or are at diſtance from? Strange Contradiction.</p>
               <p>But why is it ſo Hainous, to call ſuch Proud or Self-willed, <hi>who reſiſt the Witneſs of God in Friends</hi>? Certainly the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſound, unleſs Scripture be defective: He that can ſee any thing in them, that deſerveth ſuch hard Words, as this <hi>Billings-Gate Rhetorician</hi> beſtoweth upon us, has better Eyes then I.</p>
               <p>3ly, <hi>But they ſay, That the Church (without Diſſenters) has Power to Determine Controverſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very well; and is it not true? Are the Diſſenters from the Church part of the Church they diſſent from? For Shame! Thou Learned, and talk ſo Idly? Scripture declares, That God has given the Power of Determination to his Church: All the World knows, That Diſſenters are not of that Church they diſſent from; therefore the Church without Diſſenters, has that Power of Determination.</p>
               <p>4ly, and 5ly, <hi>But they add, That ſuch diſapproved Miniſters, ought to leave off Miniſtring till they are Reconciled to the Church: And if approved Miniſters degenerate to Diviſion, the Church has Authority to deal with them in the ſame manner; and that no ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Writings ſhould be publiſht with Conſent, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What of all this? He that can call this <hi>Imperious, Audaoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp;c.</hi> can call any thing. To allow, that Diſſentious Preachers and Writers are by the Church they diſſent from to be approved of in the Courſe of that Miniſtry and Writing, is ſuch a <hi>Bedlam, Boundleſs</hi> Piece of Stuff, that none but one, who thinks it Dangerous to be of any Party, would be the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of ſuch a Wild Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>6ly, <hi>But they adviſe, That ſuch whom the Holy Ghoſt had made
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93328:26"/>
Over-ſeers ſhould not admit of the Weak to that Truſt, nor ſuch as ſeek not the Good of all</hi>: which <hi>All</hi> this Diſingenuous Wreſter interprets, <hi>The great Body of</hi> George Fox <hi>and his Party</hi>; But Men of Wiſdom and Moderation will not, I am confident, ſo ſpoil the Text with his Comment.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>ſeventh time</hi> in two pages that <hi>G. Fox</hi> is brought in, as the Explanation of the Word <hi>Body,</hi> who was then cloſe Priſoner at <hi>Scar-brough,</hi> where no Letter was ſuffered to come to him, <hi>and who never knew of any Paper till ſometime after its being out.</hi> O the Implacable Envy of theſe Men! I have hitherto waited for that <hi>Arrogant, Imperious</hi> and <hi>Audacious</hi> Paſſage, which might have raized up our <hi>Adverſary</hi>'s Choller, and whetted him to this Degree of Scolding; but find no worſe then what I have tranſcribed and juſtified, this <hi>laſt</hi> excepted, and I think it juſtifies it ſelf: ſuch as ſeek the Good of all are certainly Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. If he dare tell us his Name, and meet me by Day <hi>(as he can poſt up his Scurrilous Title-Pages on the City Poſts, with Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beux or Links, and a Guard by Night)</hi> I will any where, and in any ſober Auditory maintain the Truth of all theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and their clear Conſiſtency with Scripture and Reaſon, on whom he has beſtowed ſo many hard Names.</p>
               <p>But 'tis to be lamented of his <hi>Cabal,</hi> that he ſhould with his Paſſion and Hate divulge ſo much Ignorance, as to cry out, <hi>That</hi> (he thinks) <hi>the</hi> Pope <hi>himſelf hath never taken ſuch Power as to determine in Matters of this Nature and Manner, but in a general Council.</hi> Poor Man! Brand us he would one way or other: Has he never read the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> nor conſidered, among many others, <hi>the Life of</hi> Paul <hi>the 3d?</hi> Is he to be informed of that Controverſie long on foot between the <hi>Jeſuits and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of</hi> Sorbon, <hi>and the Followers of</hi> Janſenius?

When the Buſineſs of the HAT fell out; I being acquainted with ſeveral of them, <hi>and looking upon them as tender to the Lord, and that they did ſcruple it only in Conſcience to him, was perſwaded in my heart they were to be born with, and thought the poſitive Teſtimony againſt it in others too ſevere, and that a thing of that Nature was not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about, but every one left to their Liberty</hi>; yea, and ſomewhat farther did I go in the Senſe of my Heart, <hi>as if poſſibly the Lord might require ſuch a thing of them.</hi> In this Frame of Spirit did I give forth thoſe <hi>Queries,</hi> not at all intending <hi>(the Lord knows) to ſtrength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MY Deſires and Breathings, from my tender years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have been after the Living God; and ſince I have taſted of his Goodneſs and Mercy, I have had a Love for, and Longing after the Eternal Welfare of all, that in any Meaſure ſought after him in Truth and Righteouſneſs; knowing the Enemy's Devices to be many and various, ſeeking by all Means to devour them; And from a deep Senſe of the ſame I writ the Paper about <hi>Geſtures</hi> and <hi>Poſtures, &amp;c.</hi> many years ſince; knowing how buſie the great Enemy of Man's Soul was at that juncture of time to draw out the Minds of ſome, <hi>into the Obſervation and Innovation of Keeping their Hats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Heads in the time of Prayer, in the publick Aſſemblies of God's People,</hi> hoping that thoſe Lines at that time might have been Succeſsful to ſtop that <hi>Practice,</hi> in ſome of them at leaſt, and alſo have allayed any thing in any others, which might be of tendency to hinder their Information and Recovery. But it was never in the leaſt in my Heart or Intention, <hi>to Encourage or Strengthen that Spirit and Practice, which my own Judgment and Practice was againſt</hi>; Neither did I intend any other <hi>Liberty</hi> then what was in the Lord, and the <hi>Maintaining Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Brethren. And truly, in theſe various or contrary Practices, <hi>of ſome keeping on their Hats, and others putting off their Hats,</hi> my Heart was affected, deſiring that the Lord would

put a Stop to whatever tended to Diſcord, <hi>which ſince hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared manifeſtly to ariſe from that Spirit, which firſt brought in that Innovation.</hi> Therefore in Good Conſcience I cannot but bear my Teſtimony againſt the Author of this ſcurrilous <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,</hi> for endeavouring, not only to faſten ſuch a Senſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon me, but alſo for his Attempt and Induſtry (what in him lies) to render God's People Odious, and his ever-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Truth Contemptible to the World, and thereby himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Murderer of Souls, in perverting the Right Way of the Lord; for which the God of Heaven will undoubtedly rebuke, both him and all his Confederates in this wicked <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, and in his time bring them to open Shame, if they Repent not of this their Wickedneſs and Sin.</hi>

the Apoſtate,</hi> who is out of the Bounds of Chriſtianity as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, or as a Man, a Neighbour, and publiſht in Print, as a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> behind my Back when I was gone beyond the Seas, and he ſent his Books and Pamphlets to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and to <hi>Jamaica</hi> and other places in <hi>America</hi> after me, to raiſe up Perſecution againſt me; yet this <hi>Pennyman</hi> did never ſo much as ſpeak to me, before he had publiſhed the ſaid Book: And thus he hunts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Life, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did after my Lord; and I know nothing of Reaſon why this <hi>J. P.</hi> would have Blood, but being gone from the Truth in himſelf, ſeeks the Life of me who keep in Truth which he is gone from. Alſo he hath ſet the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> at Work in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> Blood-thirſty Men, who ſought my Life there, who read his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> before hundreds of People, and One of theſe was <hi>Tho. Hatchman</hi> Baptiſt Preacher, who is <hi>a Proteſt Enemy to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus within</hi>; for there was one askt him, <hi>what that was in him which ſhewed him his Sin?</hi> he ſaid, he did not know; She ſaid, ſhe muſt know and ſhe would know; he ſaid, <hi>it is the Devil for ought he knew.</hi> And what are theſe <hi>Baptiſts</hi> here, which thou haſt ſet at work or given Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it? And what is <hi>Muggleton</hi> but an Adverſary of Jeſus Chriſt? who boaſted that he <hi>had curſed G. F.</hi> and ſaid, <hi>God nor Chriſt could not revoke it,</hi> in his Book, entituled, <hi>a Looking Glaſs for G. Fox</hi>; which neither <hi>J. P</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit of the Hat,</hi> nor <hi>Tyranny and Hypocriſie detected,</hi> takes notice of: but they can ſwallow down <hi>Muggleton's</hi> Blaſphemy, and will not call that Blaſphemy; therefore I challenged <hi>L. Muggleton,</hi> who curſt <hi>G. F.</hi> whom God had bleſt: And in my Challenge I told him he was not worthy to take <hi>G. Fox's</hi> Name into his Mouth, who was a Prophet of the Lord indeed, and hath been faithful in the Lord's Buſineſs from the Beginning, which I and many other faithful Witneſſes know to be true. And there were Prophets before the Law, in the Law, and after Chriſt, and now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe of God, which have been perſecuted, and ſpoken Ill againſt, as thou doſt now, and <hi>Muggleton,</hi> who curſes them. And farther I ſaid—it was ſaid of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not (whom <hi>John</hi> ſaid he was not) and this I ſay, is true, and no Blaſphemy (as my words farther concerning <hi>G. F.</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93328:38"/>
were) ſo it may be ſaid of this True Prophet. But what is that I ſaid of him, that may be called <hi>Blaſphemy?</hi> becauſe I ſay, it may be ſaid of <hi>G. F.</hi> a true Prophet, to <hi>Muggleton</hi> that curſes hin, and the World knows him not, though he is in the World? but the World knows <hi>J. P.</hi> the World will not hate him; but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>marvel not if the World hate you</hi> (Jo. 15 18.) <hi>for it hated me. I am not of the World? nor you are of the World.</hi> And is not this true <hi>Scripture</hi>? Is this <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>? And doth not the Apoſtle ſay that <hi>ye are not of the World? for if you were of the World, the World would hear you</hi> (1 Jo. 4.6.) <hi>but becauſe ye are not of the World, therefore they hear you not?</hi> but the World can hear <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> without any Hatred, but hate them that are of Chriſt. <hi>And muſt not all be made like unto the Son of God?</hi> (Heb. 7.3.) <hi>and made Conformable to his Image?</hi> but if I had ſaid as the Men of God ſaid (viz.) <hi>as Chriſt is, ſo are we in this World</hi> (Joh. 1.4. 7.) or if I had ſaid, <hi>that He that ſanctifieth and They who are ſanctified they are one</hi> (Heb. 2.11.) And if I had ſaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me</hi> (Gall. 2.20.) Then would not <hi>J. P.</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and the <hi>Hat Spirit</hi> and <hi>Tyranny &amp; Hypocriſie detected</hi> have cryed <hi>Blaſphemy, Blaſphemy, Blaſphemous Titles?</hi> for I did not ſay, nor did I ever believe that the World was made by <hi>G. F.</hi> but by Chriſt, who was in the World and the World knew him not. So I ſay, it may be ſaid of <hi>G. F.</hi> the World knows him not though he be in the World, as was ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>he was in the World,</hi> though not of the World, <hi>and the World knew him net.</hi> And he ſaid of his Followers, <hi>ye are not of the World as I am not of the World</hi> (Jo. 17.16.) And <hi>I have choſen you out of the World,</hi> (Jo. 15.19.) And this is called <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> by <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> and his Company, who are Haters of Chriſt and Perſecutors of his Members (witneſs the <hi>Baptiſt Preacher</hi> in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That which convinced of Sin was the Devil for ought he knew,</hi> before a Man and his Wife, who were People of good Repute in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes.</hi> And ſo People may ſee what Manner of Men theſe are who perſecute both in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and here in <hi>England</hi>) and call Chriſt's Words <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>; for I did not ſay that <hi>G. Fox,</hi> was Chriſt, not that the World was made by <hi>G.

Pennyman</hi> and his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates have not publiſhed againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as his Fore-fathers, did, and caſt them <hi>Blaſphemous Titles,</hi> and call them <hi>Lucifers</hi>; for Chriſt calls his Children the <hi>Light of the World</hi> (Mat. 5.14.) and a <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and the <hi>Light in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Elect before the World began</hi> (1 Pet. 1.2) and they did not live, but <hi>Chriſt lived in them.</hi> And <hi>he bath made us Kings and Prieſts to God his Father, and we ſhall reign upon the Earth</hi> (Rom. 1.5.) And what, are all theſe <hi>Blaſphemous Titles</hi>? And theſe are higher Titles then I ſpake of <hi>G. F.</hi> I ſpake Chriſt's Words, as in <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>I have given them thy Word, and the World hateth them</hi> (Mark <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts) becauſe they are not of this World, even as I am not of the World.</hi> Do you call this <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>? Then why do you thus ſeek after my Life, and publiſh Books to ſet the Magiſtrates and Ignorant upon me? but I will ſtand to my Teſitmony of my Lord and Saviours Words, though you call his Words <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi>; it is which I deſire all People to read, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit of Chriſt be the <hi>Guide</hi> of theſe Men's Actions, or the Spirit of Envy; for <hi>they that have not the Spirit of Chriſt are none of his</hi>: but the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus and of the Lamb, which is in <hi>G. F.</hi> and the Holy Brethren (the Heirs of Eternal Life) will fall heavy upon theſe Men (yea) <hi>this Stone which they reject and ſet at naught will grind them to Powder,</hi> Mat. 21.44. And farther Chriſt faith in the ſame Chapter, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the World, but that thou wouldſt keep them from the Evil</hi> (Jo. 17.) and mark <hi>J. P.</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of the Hat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hyproscriſe &amp; Tyranny detect.</hi> who would tyranize over Chriſt's Teſtimony concerning his Saints, and Followers then and now, as your Fore-Fathers did. In the 16th Verſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They are not of the World, even as I am not of the World,</hi> &amp;c. which I keep, the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and know the Truth that he ſpeaks, and do not give Titles to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93328:39"/>
none of his Saints, to <hi>G. F.</hi> nor none, beyond what Chriſt hath ſpoken; and therefore be aſhamed who profeſs your ſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> &amp; call Chriſt's Words <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> And farther Chriſt ſayes, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, I in thee, that they may be all one in us.</hi> And <hi>the Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one as thou Father and I am one, I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfect in One.</hi> And moreover <hi>John</hi> ſaith in his 1. Epiſtle Chap. 4. <hi>Ye are of God, little Children, and have overcome; becauſe, Greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the World. They are of the World, therefore the World heareth them. We are of God, he that knoweth and heareth God, heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error. Beloved, let us love one another, for Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God, and he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love.</hi> And it is very like <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> had ſuch Spirits as <hi>L. Muggleton, J. Pennyman</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and other to deal withal as I have now. And Chriſt, my Lord, ſaith to his Saints and Apoſtles, <hi>If the World hate you, you know it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the World, the World would love its own, but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hates you,</hi> Jo. 15. <hi>Remember the Words that I ſaid unto you, The Servant is not greater then his Lord,</hi> Mat. 40.24. but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every one that is Perfect ſhall be as his Maſter,</hi> Luke 6.40. <hi>If they perſecute me, they will alſo perſecute you; if they kept not my ſayings, they will not keep yours.</hi> Here you may ſee how that you are not the Keepers of Chriſt's Sayings, but the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of them that do: <hi>Ye are my Friends,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>if you do what I command, &amp;c.</hi> and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>henceforth I call you not Servants, but my Friends; for the Servant knoweth not what the Lord doth: but I have called you Friends, &amp;c.</hi> (Jo. 15.14.) <hi>You have choſen me, but I have choſen you, and have ordained you, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again you ſay in your <hi>Tyranny and Hypocriſie detected,</hi> that I ſhould ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Man that came out of the North; Bleſſed be the Womb that bare him, &amp; the Paps that gave him ſuck.</hi> As to the <hi>Former</hi> Words I might ſpeak them; but the <hi>Latter</hi> Words once applyed to Chriſt, I do not remember I ſpake them: But

And do not boaſt your ſelves, you <hi>Hat-Men,</hi> of the Abilities and Endowments, who are inventing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Lyes, and publiſhing them, like a <hi>Ballet-Singer</hi> to get a Penny, againſt the Innocent, yea, to the taking away their Lives, for all that are ſober may ſee, it is their Blood you ſeek after: For Men that have an Eſteem of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and their own Reputation, would not be ſound in ſuch Works and Actions, and be a Companion among them, nor give Ear to them; but <hi>all theſe things ſhall work together for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.38. and the <hi>Secrets of all Hearts will God

reveal and judge by the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5 For did ever I or <hi>G. F.</hi> do any Hurt to <hi>J. Pennyman,</hi> or ever give him an ill Word, who thus hath abuſed us, and publiſhed theſe things behind our Backs? But I leave him to the Great God, the Judge of all, who Juſifies and Clears the Innocent, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Guilty: For the Lord knows, that I, and I believe <hi>G. F.</hi> had nothing but Good-will for his Eternal Good, and Proſperity inwardly and outwardlv, though he has thus ill requited us, who never ſpake a Syllable to me before he printed againſt me; neither have I ſeen him, nor know not where to find him ſince I came to <hi>England</hi>: nor never ſpake he to <hi>G. F.</hi> as I underſtand, although I know, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſent for him, and he would not come. But, as I ſaid, before, I will leave all to the Righteous Judge who will render to every Man a Reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Words and Works. And my Deſire is, That all ſober People might not feed upon Lyes, publiſhed by <hi>Apoſtates</hi> and <hi>Back-ſliders,</hi> nor lend their Ear to them, but to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and feed upon him, the Heavenly Bread, that comes down from Heaven, by which they may have Life. But truly, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Children of this World are Wiſer in their Generation then the Children of the Kingdom,</hi> Luke 16.8 For I had challenged <hi>L.

                  <p>HAving peruſed a Pamphlet, called, <hi>Tyranny and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie Detected, &amp;c.</hi> I find it a very Envious, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Piece, and that the ſecret Deſign of the common Enemy in the <hi>Authors,</hi> and their <hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> is to root out Truth and Righteouſneſs from the Earth, and to bring People into <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> by endeavouring to render ſome of the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> guilty of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Evils acted by the Sons of Men, and the reſt of them (mentioning thoſe they account the <hi>Leaders</hi> and <hi>Chiefeſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) to be Connivers at, and Coverers of ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as if they did ſecretly allow thereof; and that their preaching up a Good Life was but a Decoy to gain Proſelytes: and not only ſo, but rendring the Righteous Principle of Chriſt Jeſus, which is the True Guide, the Way and the Life, which God has revealed in the Hearts of Thouſands, to be <hi>Fallible, Inſufficient, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain,</hi> or but a <hi>pretended Guide,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome that have profeſſed it have walked contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; wherby it is evident that the God of this World has blinded the Eye of their Minds, and that through Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Deſire of Revenge their Underſtandings are become darkened, that they cannot diſcern things that differ, but in Concluſion jumble all together, Juſt and Unjuſt, he that Loves and he that Hates a Lye; the Motions of God and of the Devil being in Enmity againſt that in themſelves, which makes the Separation, and gives the Diſcerning between the Pretious and the Vile; And ſo theſe <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> ſome whereof have been almoſt accounted as Diſciples, have endeavoured, as much as in them lies, <hi>to betray the Juſt into the Hands of Sinners,</hi> and to cauſe the Truth of God to be Evil-ſpoken of, by thoſe that watch for Iniquity, and hate to be Reformed. And for our own Vindication from theſe Reproaches, we do appeal to God, who knows the Secrets of all Hearts, That we do not Own or Countenance any Iniquity in our ſelves, or others;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93328:42"/>
but according to our Dotrine and Principles, do deſire and endeavour, in that Ability that God hath given us, <hi>To approve our ſelves in all-things in Sincerity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs both to God and Man</hi>; and that we had rather Dye outwardly, then ſin againſt God, wherein we have been tryed theſe many yeares, God's Witneſs in the Hearts of our Enemies will plead for us.</p>
                  <p>And farther; As to the part, which doth more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern me, wherein I am brought in as an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and <hi>John Boulton</hi> as a <hi>Tyrant</hi>: He, for <hi>Reproving an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncomely Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Invention</hi>; and my ſelf, <hi>for Denying that in Publick which in Private I Owned,</hi> I anſwered it in a former Book, and it might have been ſufficient to Reaſonable Men; For, as I then ſaid, <hi>I did not Deny what I had ſpoke at the former Meeting, but being Miſ-underſtood, I Explained it, which gave Satiſfaction</hi>: We pretend not to be above Miſ-hearings and Miſ-apprehenſions, though above Wilful Evils. Its well they have no greater Crime to accuſe me of, who are ſo Envious as to make uſe of ſuch Trifling, Inconſiderable Matters as this to Diſcredit us. Well, this I have further to ſay concerning the ſiad book, <hi>That Hell hath opened her Mouth, and the Dragon hath caſt out Floods againſt the Church, that is coming out of the Wilderneſs, which the Lord our God is building upon the Rock Chriſt Jeſus, and the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it:</hi> And many hath the Lord eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Rock, who are Inhabitants thereof, and can ſing for Joy, in the midſt of all Tryals and Excerſises, Storms and Tempeſts, knowing that our Foundation ſtands ſure; and as there we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, we can never be moved, having Salvation for Walls and Bulworks, and being kept as in the <hi>Munition of Rocks,</hi> where our Bread is ſure, and our Waters never fall; Praiſes to the Lord forever.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93328:45"/>
Joy, Reſt and Peace daily abound. In ſolemn Meetings, with Tears, I believe unfeigned, and true Contrition of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as many are Witneſſes, gave Judgment againſt that Spirit which led into Separation, through means of which he as; well as others had ſuffered loſs, as with reſpect to the Good Preſence of the Lord, in the daily Sence thereof, as (before that Spirit entred) was enjoyed; and with what Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart did we even in the firſt Love, raiſed by the Power of the Lord, in which alone doth our Unity ſtand, did we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another, and met oft with one another to our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joy and Refreſhment: But now is he not found beating of thoſe, with whom he was a Fellow-Servant, and taking of them by the Throat, and (as I may ſay) ſpeaking all manner of Evil againſt them, even them, who in a Senſe have laid down, and can, their Lives to ſave him? Surely, he who rewards Evil for Good, Evil will not, whilſt in that Spirit, depart from his Houſe. And how hath Enmity entred him in that, that which is a Strength, a Joy and a Comfort to us, Vexations to him, to wit, to ſee Brethren together in the pure Truth, in that which neither ſpeaketh nor thinketh Evil, to dwell, and ſo ſeek one another's Good, are kindly affectioned one to the other, ſerving one another with Love.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, though <hi>by Complying with G.

                  <p>But what is the Matter with you Profeſſors, that you are working in ſuch Muddle, ſo many years old, as confeſſed in the <hi>Pamphlet</hi>?

                     <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> which I fear have done it againſt their grow Knowledg; eſpecially Thou <hi>T.

Will any one, but who are filled with Enmity like thy ſelf, thus conclude, that <hi>Lying in Naſty Holes and Priſons, and Loſing our Eſtates and Lives, Limbs and Baniſhment, is to ſatisfie our Luſt</hi>? Well <hi>Thomas,</hi> my Judgment of theſe is, Thou wilt never ſatisfie thine in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but theſe are both anſwered already, who I deſire may come to Repentance, and find Mercy.</p>
                  <p>But what are you doing, <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> if you ſhould with your Aſſiſtents, the Apoſtates, accompliſh your Brethren Cruelty from <hi>New-England</hi>? Our Blood would be upon you, and your Children; For your Works which you have lately done have the very Tendency, though I am perſwaded there are ſome amongſt you hate the very Thoughts of ſuch a thing; yet I queſtion not but ſome of your <hi>Leaders,</hi> do very much deſire it, or elſe they would never hazard the very Loſs of their own Souls in Lyes and Slanders againſt us; if they believe them to be Sins. Now conſider what is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Great Difference between us and the Profeſſors: Certainly it is about <hi>Worſhipping of God;</hi> and the Occaſion of the Enmity is the ſame as was in dayes paſt; for the firſt Worſhippers that we read of, the <hi>Enmity, aroſe in him whoſe Sacrifice was not accepted with God.</hi> Profeſſors, read your ſelves, and the Cauſe of your Enmity: for thoſe who are accepted with the Lord, there is no Cauſe of Enmity; but Pitty ariſes in their Hearts towards thoſe who are not accepted and ſo Chriſt when he came, it was not to deſtroy Men's Lives, but his Goſpel was, Peace on Earth, and Good-will towards all Men; but Enmity is from the <hi>Devil,</hi> and he the Father of it.</p>
                  <p>So for your whole Work, let it return from whence it came, even the Bottomleſs Pit. And whether the Matter in it be True or Falſe, I am a Stranger to it: The Intent is Wicked, and I do not much look what thoſe have been, who are chiefly named in Your <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> by reaſon of Tender Age in the Truth, or otherwiſe; but now I know them to be Men of Integrity, and Fearing God, which is Satisfation to me: and ſo its a Sign, that when Men grow in Grace, and are better, they are the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93328:47"/>
Beloved of God, to ſuch Grace is not in Vain; but when Men grow Worſe and Worſe, and loſe their Tenderneſs once they had, and abound in Pride and Envy, this is an Evident Token of Perditon, notwithſtanding their pretended Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is not Words only God looks for, but Fruit from a Clean Heart.</p>

becomes a Tempter, and layes the Snare, that they might Sin againſt God, and be divided from The Bleſſing: And ſo mind who hindred the Building of the Temple of the Lord in the time that Deliverance drew nigh; when the great and noble Travil of the Holy Servants of the Lord that were Zealous for the Reſtoring of the Captivated to their former Liberties and Rights in the Place that then was owned and appointed of the Lord, and ever to be remembred, was and is the Courage, Boldneſs and Conſtant Watchfulneſs of thoſe Worthies, <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Zerubabel,</hi> that diſcerned the Falſeneſs and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of thoſe pretending Friends, that did not only ſeem to approve their Works, and offer to build the Houſe of the Lord, but to aſſiſt them, ſaying, <hi>Let us build with you, for we ſeek your God as you do, and that they had done it for a long time</hi>; but they being diſcerned and refuſed by <hi>Zerubabel</hi> and the other Worthies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then they manifeſted themſelves to be Hinderers of the Work of God, and hired Counſellors againſt them to fruſtrate their Purpoſe, whoſe Work a little before they pretended to be aſſiſtent to, and after write againſt them with great Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, <hi>Ezra</hi> the 4th. and the 14th. and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the 4th and the 1ſt. <hi>Sambalet</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> they mocked, taunted and ſcoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make ridiculous and little Worth the then Endeavours and good Orders, that theſe Noble Men put in Practice for the Reſtoring of the Houſe of God.

and talkes of Truth, and ſeems for it, and yet is againſt it, is not of God, though it ſeems ſo; for here firſt ſprang, and is continued that monſtrous, <hi>Anti-Chriſtian Brood,</hi> that hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Earth with Darkneſs, Blood and Cruelty, and with theſe ſhall thoſe be judged, that in this our Day have given and taken Offences, to lay Stumblings in the Way of the Simple; But Glorified be the Power that hath broke forth, before which they muſt all fly; yet here and there a few crawle up to uſe their Strength againſt the Increaſe of his Power, <hi>the Word of whoſe Mouth ſhall deſtroy them, and the Brightneſs of his Coming ſhall utterly conſume them</hi>: for they are ſuch of whom the Apoſtle complained, had done him much Wrong; for they hindred as much as in them lay the Purpoſe of the Lord in the Earth. And this hath been the Work of many in this our Day of God's Appearance, from the beginning thereof, and by ſuch as came to ſee the Glory of Truth, and heard gladly for a Seaſon, as they that receive the Seed in the high way, where it was either loſt, or carried away by the Fowls of the Air: and theſe could never fell All for the Kingdom, nor take up the daily Croſs, ſo miſt the Life, and came to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about with Winds, and miſſing of the Righteouſneſs of God, have gone about to eſtabliſh their own, and blindly Zealous, have watched others Vineyards, and neglected their own; ſo Withering and Fruitleſneſs hath come upon them, until they are twice dead.

Never did hungry Beaſts more earneſtly ſeek their Prey to devour it, then theſe Back-ſliders have and do watch, to catch the Miſcarriages of any ſuch as do profeſs the Faith; and if they can find a little, they make it a great deal by Whiſperings and Back-bitings, and large Intimations, more by much then the Subſtance, and in all pretending to be in an

                  <p>And by Queſtion they ask, <hi>How could this accute Man ſay, The Meeting would not hinder his Marriage?</hi> To this, as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I anſwer, I heard, with many more, <hi>J.

And for the Charge writ againſt me, it is utterly falſe in Matter and Words, as theſe Accuſers have ſtated it; for thoſe words, they ſay, I cried out, no Man nor Woman, that was <hi>preſent in that great Congregation,</hi> will witneſs it, if they fear to Lye, and there are may many Witneſſes of what I ſaid; and though I was permitted to ſpeak a few words at that time, that one or more of their Informers heard me ſay, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as not expedient, to have been ſpoken there; but they being in the Dark, have altogether miſt it, and placed a Lye of their own making in the ſtead of what I ſpoak: But I unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deſire, that they may find a place of Repentance for this; and all other their Evils. But it is followed with another Falſity; for ſay they, <hi>By her Authority, and</hi> J. O<hi>'s Intereſt,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93328:50"/>
they proceeded te Marry without's Licenſe.</hi> As to Licenſe from any Man or Woman to Marry, I have often publickly (as called to it) born my Witneſs againſt, and with the reſt of the Lord's People declared, <hi>We make no Marriages, nor break no Marriages, nor Marry any, but every True Man and Wife ſhould known their being joyned of the Lord,</hi> and ſo were theſe Couple; yet did not, nor durſt not go brutiſhly together, as ſome preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more Holineſs, then others have done; but this prudent Couple, according to the Example of Holy Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, had many Witneſſes of the People of the Lord, and in an Orderly, Solemn Aſſembly took each other, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Power of the Lord ſealed to it; and ſhe was a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him to whom the Lord gave her all her days: And I was ſo far from the Exerciſe of Authority in that Matter, that I know not that I Invited one to the Marriage, much leſs Commanded; and <hi>J.

                  <p>And if any Righteous Soul, grieved and burdened with their Bringings forth in Miſchief, Write or Anſwer them ſharply, they imagine they get Strength by it, and ſhew it to Adverſaries of Truth, as if the People of the Lord did Amiſs in Clearing the Truth, and throwing back the Dirt on them, from whence it comes (but let all take notice, that the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> was Juſtified in his Reproaching of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts in their Blind Worſhips and Mad Fury; for the True God appeared to him for his Juſtification, as be doth unto us, that abide in his Power unto this day) But for the Taunts and Mockings of <hi>Samballat</hi> &amp; <hi>Tobiah,</hi> they are recorded for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy forever: <hi>For, what is the Chaff to the Wheat,</hi> ſaith the Lord?</p>
                  <p>And I did not, nor do not intend to Controvert, or Anſwer the Writings of theſe Enemies of Truth, having not ſo much as read them through; only a few Lines, which being Falſe,

                  <p>And whereas you ſay in pag. 12. <hi>the Papiſts ſay, They believe as the Church believes, ſo likewiſe ſayes</hi> G. F. but the <hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> ſayes <hi>Nay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is known to all the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to be a Lye againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> for <hi>G.

                  <p>And the <hi>Hat Spirit</hi> ſayes, <hi>He is informed of a Meeting, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by</hi> G.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is another Forgery of the <hi>Hat-Spirit</hi>; for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and Wantonneſs, bleſſed be the Lord, they are ſtrange things among us: but if any Unſeemly thing hath at any time been done, ſuch were dealt with according to the Order of the Goſpel, without Reſpect to Perſons. And this we have further to ſay, That none have been more Notorious then ſome of the <hi>Hat-Spirit</hi>; but we ſhall not run into ſuch Traſh, nor have we any ſuch Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the <hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>giving Nick-Names</hi>; and they put themſelves, <hi>We were called</hi> Quakers.</p>
                  <p>But do theſe of the <hi>Hat-Spirit</hi> now Tremble at the Word? Nay; if they did, they durſt not utter forth or ſpeak forth ſuch Nick-Names againſt the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor father ſuch Envious, Malitious Language againſt the Power of Chriſt and his Spirit in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as they do.</p>

his Company caſts upon <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſayes, <hi>He was in ſuch a Rage, that</hi> W. G. <hi>thought he would have ſtruck</hi> S. N. Which thing is falſe; there was no Appearance of any ſuch thing, as the Meeting can teſtifie, and I am a Witneſs, who was at that Meeting: And thus with your Lyes and Slanders you think to feed the Airy Minds, and make them a Feaſt. And as for <hi>W. G.</hi> he hath been heartily Sorry for Unadviſedly Speaking ſuch words.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>G. F</hi>'s Books to the Lawyers and Judges did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what was then acted or ſpoken in the Meeting; and therefore the 46th page of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat's Tyranny and Hypocriſie</hi> is full of Lyes. And alſo the ſame Slander and Lye is mentioned in page 42. of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat, That ſome there preſent thought that</hi> G. F. <hi>would have ſtruck</hi> S. N. and thus you add Lye unto Lye to ſtuff up your Paper, which, as is ſaid before, there was no ſuch thing; but the Man that did report it is heartily Sorry for it. But it ſeems, you <hi>Hat-Spirits</hi> torment your ſelves, and are vext about <hi>G. F</hi>'s Marriage; but why did not the <hi>Hat-Spirit</hi> reprove <hi>J. P.</hi> for his Voluptuous Marriage, with his Veniſon Paſties, which were pulled about, to the ſpoiling of the Creature, and making a Scramble for the Multitude? Oh Shameful Doings!</p>
                  <p>In pag. 19, 20. of the <hi>Spirit of the Hat's Tyranny and Hypecri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> and in page 32. in all thoſe pages is mentioned <hi>John White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s Paper, and <hi>G. F.</hi> is charged with opening <hi>J. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s Letter, which was writ by him, which is a Lye, and a Forgery; for <hi>G. F.</hi> did not open the Letter, but it was ſent Open, only Encloſed to another, and left to <hi>G. F.</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends to diſpoſe of, as <hi>J. W</hi>'s Teſtimony under his own Hand (before going) doth teſtifie: And therefore here you may ſee what ſort of Men theſe are, that forge ſuch Lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>G. F.</hi> And that which he left to <hi>G. F.</hi> and others to alter, was the Matter concerning <hi>Wearing the Hat in Prayer</hi>; for that was the Matter then in Controverſie (and not Other things) which he wrote to you; <hi>For the Spirit of the Prophets is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>George Biſhop</hi>'s Paper, mentioned in your <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Hypocriſie,</hi> about the time that you would have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93328:58"/>
thruſt your <hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> in amongſt us, he did give it a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Blow in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which you might have done well to have printed with his Paper: but it is like that made againſt you, who feed upon Condemned Stuff, Actions which many have been ſorry for, running into in the time of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, wherein they beguiled the Simplicity, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Chriſt, their Shepherd, and feed amongſt the Flocks of his Paſture; but God's Words are true. <hi>The Serpent muſt feed on Duſt,</hi> who is out of Truth, <hi>Duſt is the Serpent's Meat</hi>; Your Sting, Venum and Poiſon is felt and ſavoured.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>John Bolton</hi>'s Reproving the <hi>Slit in the Woman's Coat,</hi> which you ſtuff up your Book with, and <hi>G. F</hi>'s Paper againſt <hi>Faſhion</hi> and <hi>Images, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may feed on ſuch Stuff, who live in the Vain Faſhions which therein are declared againſt, and which ſhall ſtand over you and your Images,</p>
                  <p>And as for all your <hi>Aggravations</hi> and <hi>Nick- Names,</hi> which proceed from your bitter Gaul and Envy, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> like, we ſhall leave to God to judge of; for there are few ſober Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but ſee your Books are a piece of Envy, Malice, Hatred and Spight, and to be a Spirit that ſeeks Blood, and you would not have been ſo ſerved your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And you make a great Clamour againſt our <hi>Law, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, as before, Our Order is the Goſpel Order, and our Law is the Spirit of Life, which we received, which is in Chriſt Jeſus, the Heavenly Man, by which the Old <hi>Adam</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are judged.</p>
                  <p>And further, The <hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> ſaith, <hi>That</hi> G. F. <hi>and ſome others; the Elders, had a Meeting to Judge and Condemn ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men and Women of Good Report.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why might not <hi>William Mucklow</hi> have ſaid, That he was one of them, that had reported that Slander to a Laſs, upon a Woman that was Innocent, who was judged for it?</p>
                  <p>And this is another Lye, in your ſaying, <hi>That</hi> G. F. <hi>and others endeavour to ſubvert the Royal Law of Liberty,</hi> pag. 38. For had you owned it, and kept in it, you would not have done
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93328:58"/>
that unto us, as you have done; Neither did God or Chriſt ever teach you to utter forth thoſe <hi>Scoffing Expreſſions</hi> againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> and the People of God, as may be ſeen in the 40th Page of the <hi>Hat-Spirit</hi>; and it is the <hi>Hat-Spirit</hi> indeed, for it is not the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>And in pag. 3, &amp; 4. of your <hi>Tyranny and Hypocriſie,</hi> there it is ſaid, <hi>Our Principles are far different from what we profeſs open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that we act upon the ſame Principles as the Court of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>Oh Lyes, and Malitious Men! All theſe are your invented Lyes; for you and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> we deny, your Spirit and Power, who are of the ſame Spirit that would murder us, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did formerly; your Spirit is favoured: How we invite People to Chriſt, both in publick and private, the Lord knows, to whom we leave you, for him to deal with you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Works.</p>
                  <p>And in the 7th page of your <hi>Hypocriſie and Tyranny,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>For if every Man upon pain of Sin, walk according to the Light in his own particular, then he cannot without Sin walk according to the Light in</hi> G. F. <hi>or others, when that is diverſe or contrary from his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for your <hi>Light,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It is Darkneſs,</hi> your Works and Words do manifeſt it, who are condemned with the Light, which <hi>G. F.</hi> and we, and others walk in, which is the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, which makes you to Rage; and then we know that you cannot bear our Judgment, nor <hi>G. F</hi>'s: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as pretend the Light of Chriſt, and are Haters and Perſecutors with your Tongues of them that walk in the Light, we have no Unity with you, as before. But you often with Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations and Malice quote <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſcoffingly ſay, <hi>your Elders,</hi> throwing Dirt at them, to make them Odious amongſt ſuch as your ſelves, putting your Bear-Skins upon them, that you may ſet the Dogs upon them,</p>
                  <p>And we and <hi>G. F.</hi> do know the things of God, by the Spirit of God; and the Scripture doth not reveal the Scripture, but the Spirit of God is it that leads into all Truth, and it is the ſame that is revealing the Father to us.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you make a great Complaint (in the 16th
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93328:59"/>
page) of the <hi>Quakers, not letting ſome of you Bury in their Burying-Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, when ſome of you <hi>Hat-Men</hi> have come with Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Abuſive Terms againſt us, with Abuſive Language, and called us worſe then the Prieſts; and when his Child has dyed, then the Father of ſuch a Child has come to us to have a Grave, not out of any Conſcience, but <hi>to ſave his Money,</hi> we have bid him then go to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> whom he counted better then we, with whom he had Fellowſhip. And ſuch <hi>Looſe Perſons,</hi> that live not in the Truth, <hi>We cannot be Witneſſes of their Marriages</hi>; for we Marry none, but are Witneſſes: and well might <hi>J. B.</hi> deny <hi>William Mucklow,</hi> who, <hi>Ranter</hi>-like, kept on his Hat in Prayer; we have no Unity with ſuch Uncomely Practices. And <hi>J. Oſgood</hi> and others may praiſe God that they ſee your Folly, and have given a Sufficient Teſtimony concerning your Spirit.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems you are tormented becauſe <hi>G. F.</hi> ſent for two <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> which came to hear him in <hi>America,</hi> and were tender: you wanted ſomething to ſtuff up your Book withal; had they been Malitious, it would have pleaſed you.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you Scoff at our <hi>Order of Marriage,</hi> page 21, 22. and call it <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Order</hi>: We muſt tell you, It is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Practice of the Holy Men of God, mentioned in Scriptures, who took one another before Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you Wickedly ſay, <hi>We Contradict one another in the Light and Spirit.</hi> This is all like the reſt; for ſuch as you we can ſavour, You <hi>Hat-Men,</hi> who have pretended to lean upon the Lord, but have, and ſome have had a Bitter Cup for it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>G. F</hi>'s words were true in time of <hi>J. P</hi>'s Wearing his Hat in Prayer; if all be left to the Free Spirit of God, there had been no ſuch Reaſoning about <hi>the Hat in Prayer,</hi> which you ſhould have printed the reſt of <hi>G. F</hi>'s words, how that we denyed the Wearing the Hat in Prayer in the <hi>Ranters,</hi> in the time of <hi>J. N.</hi> and alſo in the time of <hi>J. P.</hi> and did alſo deny the Practice and Principle, and directed People to keep in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93328:59"/>
Power and Spirit that the Apoſtle was in, who ſaid, <hi>Men ſhould Pray <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovered,</hi> as they did in the Apoſtles dayes.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you <hi>liken us to the Church of</hi> Rome, pag. 25. ſcoffingly. It is no matter to us, if the <hi>Pope</hi> profeſs God and Chriſt, and put off his Hat when he prayes; we ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God nor Chriſt, nor keep on our Hats when we pray becauſe of that.</p>
                  <p>And in pag. 29. you make a great <hi>Out-Cry,</hi> becauſe we ſaid in our Declaration, <hi>We alwayes paid our Taxes</hi>; and then you ſay, <hi>An Honeſt-hearted Woman paid none.</hi> We know ſhe was a Whimſical Woman, and whither her Whimſies carried her, viz. <hi>Mary Boreman,</hi> now called, <hi>Mary Pennyman.</hi>

                  <p>And whereas you ſay, they <hi>are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> G. F. <hi>and his Adherents, and ſuch as exalt themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is Spight and Malice, and much ſuch Stuff is in the 30<hi>th.</hi> page not worth taking notice of: for <hi>Dignity</hi> is the Power of God, which <hi>G. F.</hi> and we own; and they are the Body of Chriſt that are in it. You cannot exalt your ſelves above it, nor the Doctrine of Truth that is in Ancient Friends (which the Devil is out of) who are made God's Free Men and Women by it; and God has given us Power and Spirit to judge ſuch Envious Spirits as this Book comes from: and ſo, we have no Unity with ſuch that be out of the Truth, neither can we have any hand in publiſhing their Books, and we have a care of them that are printed on the Truth's Account.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>you ſay, that none may be permitted to publick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but theſe that ſeek the Good of all, that is, ſubmit to the Body of</hi> G. F. <hi>and his Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is Envy and Lyes again: Where were there ever ſuch Words ſpoken, to ſubmit to the Body of <hi>George Fox</hi> and his Party? may not the leaſt feel the <hi>Deviliſh</hi> Spirit in theſe Words? for we would have all to ſubmit <hi>to the Body,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt is the head of,</hi> and ſuch, in Chriſt's Power and Spirit, are fit to do Buſineſs in the Church, that ſeek the Good of all; and we limit not the Lord, but would have all obey him in his true Light, in which there is Fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>ſome of our Hearers have been weary of our long Preaching.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is like they were ſuch as <hi>John Pennyman</hi> and othe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatet,</hi> who come crying againſt us in a publick Meeting like the World.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>John Perrot</hi> (who is gone) we do very well know what he was, and what Imaginations he went into, though he and you, lay it falſly upon the Lord: and we contradicting him and his Practice, in <hi>Wearing his Hat</hi> and Covering his Head <hi>in Prayer,</hi> was not only from <hi>G. F.</hi> but the Apoſtles; and if <hi>J. Perrot</hi> and his Party, did ſpeak againſt <hi>G.

                  <p>And <hi>you ſcoffingly ſay, if</hi> J. Perrot <hi>he condemned,</hi> Fox <hi>cannot ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why? becauſe <hi>Perrot</hi> pretended a Revelation to do that which the Apoſtle forbids: but, poor People! you have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted your ſelves,and thus you are angry becauſe <hi>G. F.</hi> and others cannot change like you, to your <hi>Hat-Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>thou ſpeaks to a Declaration and Scurrilous Paper,</hi> pag. 37. thou ſhouldſt have printed the whole Declaration, that People might have ſeen what it was; which Declaration was againſt Wickedneſs &amp; Uncleanneſs, and Scandalous Books, and Papers againſt us.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> I never heard any one ſay otherwiſe of him, but that it was a mad and wicked Action, to which the Devil lead him, when he followed his Motions, to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> to burn his Books: and what did he carry the <hi>Bible</hi> and the Book of Martyrs there for? think you.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you make a great Buſineſs of <hi>Tho. Ibbit</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtonſhire</hi>; Friends were tender to him, and though he had a true Prophecy, and a Sight of the Fire, yet he afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the exceeded, and ſaw himſelf: And why do you mention <hi>G.

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:93328:60"/>And though <hi>J.

                  <p>And in page 44. you ſay that <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> complains and tells the World in his refuſing, to ſign a Certificate of <hi>Wm.

                  <p>And whereas you ſay in your <hi>Tyranny and Hypocriſie, He will not count himſelf Obliged to keep off his Hat by Vertue of</hi> G.F. <hi>his Law.</hi>

pretended Motion, and ſome in Oppoſition, in their Wills; and there are many Lyes in that page, which are not worth mentioning.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Vitious Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Strumpets,</hi> or <hi>Wantonneſs</hi>: We deny, the Lord knows our Hearts; and have ever ſearcht and ſeekt out, and admoniſhed, and reproved by the Power of Chriſt, who has given us Power amongſt our ſelves, not to ſuffer ſuch Actors and Actions amongſt us, and therefore not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>Major,</hi> nor the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> nor <hi>Common Council</hi>; they ſee enough of that among your Church every day: and let the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Hat-Men</hi> bring out their own of their own Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with the reſt of their Confederates, as many we might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize, and let their Six, or their Dozen of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> or <hi>Common-Council</hi> judge them, if they cannot judge, themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>J. G. D. B. W. W. T. T.</hi> and <hi>T.

And if <hi>W. C.</hi> was accuſed long ago in <hi>London,</hi> and hath condemned his Evil, and cleared God's Truth, this clears us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns your Wickedneſs. And as for <hi>T. M</hi>'s committing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs when imployed by <hi>G. F.</hi> to judge Perſons and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, this is utterly falſe; for <hi>G. F.</hi> did not imploy him: but when any thing was manifeſt of him, that was Uncivil, he was dealt withal according to Goſpel-Order. But as for your Charging him in Commiting Uncleanneſs, we leave him to deal with you for it; who, it may be, you may find like one of your ſelves, that wil ſoon go with you to an <hi>Alderman</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> who formerly charged the <hi>Miſtres,</hi> but now you ſay, it is your Miſtake, it is the <hi>Maid</hi>; and thus your Tongue is your own, who matter not what you ſay; but I leave <hi>T.

                  </p>
                  <p>So our <hi>Adeverſary</hi> would have us to Judge or Diſown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Teſtimony; this is like his Law, page 50.</p>
                  <p>And as for your ſaying, <hi>Scandalous Familiarity of the Prophets and Propheteſſes, or Miſtreſſes before Mariage,</hi> muſt go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;

                     <hi>John Boulton</hi> ſayes, <hi>he never ſaid that they confeſt to thoſe Charges charged againſt them</hi>: For, if thoſe things had been true, it had been a Shame for Modeſty to ſpeak of them; but upon their being Examined, they did deny that they were guilty of ſuch things, but in ſome things they were Childiſh, which they were ſorry for; which Confeſſion of theirs, and Anſwer to the Dirty Papers, which you feed upon, <hi>J.

                  <p>And you make a great Matter about <hi>G. F.

And are not all the true Saints Heirs of the <hi>Kingdom that ſtands in Power, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi>?

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93328:63"/>THus <hi>Reader,</hi> haſt thou the <hi>Teſtimonies of ſeveral Perſons named in that Libel</hi>; ſome of whom are more obſcure, others more known: their Truth and Honeſty ſhall ſpeak for them, I will not; But moſt of them are too Noted for Worth and Integrity to be doubted upon a <hi>Libel, ſtuffed with that Rage, Treachery, Slander and Scoff.</hi> We might alſo produce the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations</hi> of three Perſons againſt themſelves, the firſt Letters of whoſe Names are unworthily mentioned by the <hi>Libeller</hi>; but the Truth is ſufficiently cleared, and their Addition would give the Book too great a Bulk; we rather wiſh It had been many Sheets leſs, knowing that great Books are ſeldom read in this Careleſs and Impatient Age: only <hi>Reader</hi> be pleaſed to Conſider the <hi>Deceit of this Adverſary,</hi> and how ready he is to ſtretch any thing to ſlander and defame both Particulars and a Society. The <hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> charg'd our Miniſtry with Whoredoms and Strumpets in the preſent tenſe: This <hi>Apologizer</hi> tells the World, our Anſwer was Evaſion, becauſe we took it ſo; for ſayes he, <hi>the Book meant it of time paſt</hi>: that the Book meant no ſuch thing, unleſs a thing means quite otherwiſe then it ſayes, read the Paſſage. Next, what is that to us if a <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Demas</hi> that received part of the Miniſtry, fall into the Evil of this World again; can we do any more then Condemn it, and we did nothing leſs? Is that to prove <hi>our Miniſtry Vitious</hi> to tell a Story, perhaps ſeven or ten Years ſince, of any one or two that have at times opened their Mouth in our Aſſemblies? Oh! God, the Righteous and Terrible Judge, will reckon with this Ungodly <hi>Libeller,</hi> and thoſe Baſe, Murdering <hi>Judaſſes</hi> that have furniſht him with this dirty Traſh: <hi>God will clear our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and detect their Envy and Hypocriſie</hi> more convincingly to all the World: and that dreadful, black and Stormy Day that haſtens to try and win now the Nations, will ſcatter them and their Miſchievous Deſigns, when God will preſerve us in his Fear and Counſel, by his Power, to his Eternal Praiſe, and our Conſolation, World without End.</p>

               <head>A Poſtſcript To the READER, Concerning the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of our</hi> Adverſaries <hi>againſt</hi> us, <hi>amidſt the</hi> great Diſcord they are at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves.</head>
               <p>HOw hearty theſe Men are in their <hi>Envy</hi> againſt us, and <hi>Hatred</hi> to the Way we profeſs, is very diſcernable from their <hi>cloſe Confederacy</hi> and <hi>ſtrict Union,</hi> who are as remote, and differing from, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely contradictory to one another in their <hi>Faith, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as to the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves, againſt whom they have combined. They are made up of ſome <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Socinians</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates from us.</hi> A ſtrange Medley of <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and ſtranger, that there ſhould be ſuch Union to Miſchief! But let us view ſome of their Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt,</hi> The <hi>Presb. Indep.</hi> And <hi>Anab.</hi> believe that the <hi>Father, the Son, and the Spirit</hi> (though three Names, denoting three Perſonalities or Subſiſtences) <hi>are One, Infinite, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Omnip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t God,</hi> At which the modern <hi>Socinian</hi> cryes, <hi>Blaſphemy and Idolatry</hi>; For, ſayes he, <hi>Chriſt is but purely a Man, and the Spirit but a Creature.</hi> Now come in theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> againſt the Presb. Indep. Anabapt. <hi>We deny your Perſonalities and Subſiſtences</hi>; And to the Socinians,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93328:64"/>
                  <hi>We own Chriſt and the Spirit to be of one Nature and Being with God the Father; And it is Blaſphemy to ſay, that Chriſt and the Spirit are Creatures.</hi> Here's the firſt <hi>Diſcord</hi> or <hi>Jumble</hi> between our Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Presbyter. Indep. Anab. and theſe Apoſtates, <hi>aſſert God to be a Spirit,</hi> At which theſe Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiz'd Followers of <hi>John Bidle</hi> ſay, <hi>There's no ſuch thing</hi>; but, with <hi>J. Reeve</hi> and <hi>L. Muggleton, That he has a Body like to a Man, and inhabits a certain Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. and Anab. concerned chiefly againſt us, hold, <hi>That God from all Eternity elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain Number to Salvation, and reprobated the reſidue to eternal Damnation, without reſpect to any Condition of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or Diſobedience, thereby to illuſtrate his own Soveraigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory</hi>; which Principle theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> have ſo much Underſtanding yet left, as to repute <hi>pernicious</hi> and <hi>damnable.</hi> The like do ſome of theſe <hi>Socinians</hi> we have to do with; others of them having <hi>wheel'd off a few years ſince to the</hi> Geneva <hi>Predeſtinarian ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. and Anab. believe, <hi>That by Chriſt's Life and Sufferings wholely without, God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice was Satisfied for Sins, and Juſtification compleatly wrought for the Elect, not only by Forgiving Sins paſt, but reputing them really Juſt and Righteous whilſt actually Sinful</hi>; which kind of Doctrine theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> deny, as alſo doth the <hi>Socinian,</hi> affirming, <hi>That God needed no ſuch rigid Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that this is not to make him Righteous, but Revengeful; and that Chriſt cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be the Cauſe as the Effect of the Father's Love</hi>; For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c. And <hi>though ſuch are forgiven who truly Repent, and that Remiſſion was ſealed by Chriſt's Blood, as a Sacrifice; yet Men are not made really Righteous within, by any Imputation from another's Righteouſneſs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93328:65"/>
without, while they are really Unrighteous within.</hi> This is the 4th. Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Presb. Indep. and Anab. <hi>believe Chriſt to have now in Heaven an Human Body, or one of Fleſh, Blood and Bones.</hi> The Socinian and theſe Apoſtates ſay, <hi>he hath no ſuch Body, but that which he hath is more Spiritual and glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6ly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. Anabapt. and theſe Apoſtates affirm <hi>the Immortality of the Soul. The</hi> Socinians <hi>deny it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7thly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. Anab. and Socinian <hi>deny the Light that ſhines within, to be Chriſt in his Spiritual Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Theſe Apoſtates, though erred from it, yet <hi>affirm it to be ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8thly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. Anab. <hi>deny that it can lead Men that obey it unto Salvation.</hi> The Socinian with theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, affirm, <hi>that it is able to lead ſuch as follow it to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9ly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. Anab. and Socinian <hi>deny the Spirit to be poured out in theſe, as former Ages; or that Men ought to wait for the Motions of it to Preach, Pray, or Praiſe God,</hi> Theſe Apoſtates in words <hi>confeſs to maintain the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>10ly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. Anab. and Socinian affirm, <hi>That the Scriptures are the only ſtanding Rule, to meaſure and try Doctrines, and Spirits by under the Goſpel</hi>; Theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates believe no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>11ly,</hi> The Presb. Indep. Anab. and Socinians <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the Practice of Keeping on the Hat in time of publick Prayer</hi>; Theſe Apoſtates call the Pulling of it off, <hi>a Tradition of Men, a Romiſh Tradition, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, <hi>Reader,</hi> for our ſeaſonable and due, proceeding againſt them, as Innovators upon the Church of Chriſt, and Diſturbers of our Peace, by this new, unprofitable,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93328:65"/>
and irreverent Practice, denying them in their perſiſtence and rejecting their Motions, as not coming from the Spirit of God, are we furiouſly fallen upon by ſome of each of thoſe fore-mentioned <hi>Parties</hi>; who (as Men forgetting their own <hi>Eſſential Differences,</hi> and that <hi>Perſecution</hi> they have followed one another with for years) like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Scribes, Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> unanimouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our Diſgrace &amp; Overthrow in the World; as if they were all of one Faith in Doctrine, who ſcarcely in any two moſt weighty Points hit: which ſhews, that Men under divers fundamental Differences, may be acted by one and the ſame Spirit of Envy and Bitterneſs againſt the Truth, and them that live therein. What elſe can I call that which has given theſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> that place in their Hearts (that while Faithful, hated them, as they ſtill do us) who <hi>Judas</hi>-like have run away from us, to inform our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies which way they may take us at an Advantage?</p>
               <p>Theſe Men they hug, commend and vindicate at ſo high a rate, as if they were the only great <hi>Pilgrims</hi> on Earth for Righteouſneſs (as much as they differ) and we, a Crew of <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> Their <hi>Innovation</hi> muſt be called <hi>Goſpel-Liberty</hi>; but our <hi>Religious-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Tyranny</hi>: They juſtifie the Motions of theſe <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi> and, condemn <hi>Us</hi> for refuſing them, whom <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both deny Motions,</hi> and the Way to know them. They put me in mind of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of old, who were ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom wanting, in the Promotion of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the <hi>Heathen</hi>; nay, they were glad, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the leaſt Occaſion to ſet the <hi>Infidels</hi> upon their backs alwayes the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; yea, that very thing for which the <hi>Jew</hi> in his time ſuffered from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> to wit, <hi>That they worſhipped an Aſs's Head,</hi> was after abuſively
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93328:66"/>
made the Reproach of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> both by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> What others have we received from the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> of this Age? who make us to inherit that ſort of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering which they once thought Ungodly in their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>How welcome was a Renegado</hi> Chriſtian <hi>to the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>or a Backſlider to the</hi> Jew? How cheery were they of ſuch an one's Intelligence? and how apt to aggravate it to the Wrong of <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> But if that was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>True,</hi> becauſe of the Unfaithfulneſs and Treachery of its Profeſſors; neither is our <hi>Way</hi> to be concluded <hi>Falſe,</hi> nor our <hi>Society Criminal,</hi> becauſe a few ſtragling <hi>Renegadoes</hi> have in their Diſcontents, furniſht ſome common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with a broken &amp; imperfect Account of our <hi>Church-Proceedings</hi>: But as this will turn little to their Credit with Wiſe and Juſt Men, ſo have we Confidence in God, that having brought us through many Difficulties, he will continue to preſerve us through the Peril of <hi>Falſe Brethren,</hi> and all other Tribulations, which do, and will but work a far more exceeding Weight of Glory, yea of that Glory which was with the Father before the World began; and in the Poſſeſſion of which, the now <hi>deſpiſed Flock of God</hi> ſhall reſt with him in that World which never had Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and is without End.</p>
