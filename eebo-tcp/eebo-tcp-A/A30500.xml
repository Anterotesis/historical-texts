            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat and Honourable workes ought to bee directed by great and Honourable Councells; And therefore to the intent this noble Enterpriſe may not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued (as it is by ſome) I humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this Honourable Court, that beſides ſundry at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts made by divers Noble men, who deſired to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the great levell of Fenns; the undertaking was ſo well eſteemed by King <hi>JAMES,</hi> that Hee really intended to take it into His owne care; the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:64729:3"/>
of His Royall intention is unknowne. After him the Late Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> and his friends adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great ſummes of money to recover them; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their workes were finiſhed, they were circumvented and outed of all their intendments. The laſt underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was attempted by the Kings Majeſty that now is; but the greateſt part of His money being miſ-ſpent, and all his intended workes miſled by Sir <hi>Cornelius Vermuden's</hi> myſticall deſigne, His now Majeſty hath declined His undertaking alſo, ſo that it is like to returne to the now Earle of <hi>BEDFORD</hi> and his friends.</p>
            <p>This Noble Enterpriſe being thus miſguided, lyeth now before your grave Wiſdomes, expecting direction from this Honourable Aſſembly, and wanting a better friend to petition for them, (there being an Order made by the Honourable Committee for the Fens, the twenty five of February laſt, that all men whom it may concern may offer any other deſigne; In regard a perfect deſigne concerneth the preſervation of many mens eſtates, which alſo may be ruined, impaired, or caſt into eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.) I am humbly bold to informe you, that unleſſe this Honourable Court command the now intended works to be publiſhed to the ſeverall Counties (as was once intended by the Honourable Committee) ſo that the Countries approbation, or exceptions may bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued (or at the leaſt heard.) And that before the works beginne, equall compoſitions may bee made with all thoſe whoſe Lands ſhall bee impaired, endangered, or
<pb facs="tcp:64729:3"/>
taken from them: many men may bee ruined in their just Eſtates. There are two Reaſons that make me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in this cauſe: The one is the former ill deſigning, and ill mannaging of the workes, wherein Wilfulneſſe and Ignorance (in the Kings Name) over-ruled the Countries. The other concernes my ſelfe, firſt, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great part of my owne Land (and ſome of that which I Farme) from me, without ſatisfaction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or leave to cut it; and which is much worſe, by bringing all the reſt of my Inheritance, and leas't Lands (which together are not leſſe than three thouſand Acres) into eminent danger of drowning, by cutting my old firme Banck, and expoſing my Lands to bee defended from the common waters by a hollow coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Banck, made of ſo light a compoſition, that it will both burne and ſwim.</p>
            <p>And here I beſeech you give mee leave to tell you, that for want of Iuſtice in ENGLAND, and Peace in IRELAND, my aged Mother; my ſelfe and foure Brethren, have within a few yeares lost nine hundred and ſixty pounds <hi>per annum:</hi> which when time will give me leave, I hope to prove before this Honourable Parliament; which makes me the more earnestly implore your aide in this my great neceſsity.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if this Noble Enterpriſe by your Honourable paines, be well deſigned, and ſo proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; The Improvement will not only returne a
<pb facs="tcp:64729:4"/>
ſufficient ſatisfaction to the adventurers, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will ſweetly relliſh the great Improvement which will follow. But becauſe it is not ſafe to be over large in great promiſes, I will ſay no more; but GOD grant the Fenns may in due time be made VVinter grounds, not impairing any private mans eſtate.

            <head>A BRIEFE RELATION Of the true Cauſes why the FENNS In Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Northampton, and Lincolne Shires, have beene drowned. AND As briefly how they may be drained, and preſerved from Inundation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I declare the Reaſons why thoſe Low Lands are ſubject to drowning; I conceive it is fit to diſcover to them that doe not know thoſe Countries, in what condition the Fens were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were drowned: How they are ſeated, and how they are drowned.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Brittania, folio</hi> 449. referres his Readers to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> who reporteth the Lordſhip of <hi>Thorney</hi> in his time to be ſo fruitfull and fragrant, that for delight it reſembled Heaven it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64729:5"/>That Lordſhip is indeed a large and rich piece of Land, conſiſting of eighteen thouſand Acres, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and pertaineth to the Earles of <hi>Bedford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having loſt the beauty lately mentioned (nay to be plaine) being quite loſt, and perpetually drowned, ſave onely one Hillocke where the Abbey ſtandeth, was the cauſe that induced the late Earle to undertake the drayning of the great Levell. In which ſervice, by reaſon of my imployment under his Lordſhip in the yeare 1635. In deepning <hi>Wisbeach</hi> River, I diſcovered a ſtony bottome, upon which there was found lying at ſeverall diſtances ſeven boates, which for many yeares had laine buried eight foot under the bottome of the River, as it was before the late Earles underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And it is very likely, that when <hi>Thorney</hi> flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>Neene</hi> did run as deepe as that bottome.</p>
            <p>After this diſcovery, it was intended by the late Earle that the River <hi>Neene</hi> ſhould have been enlarged and deepned from <hi>Wisbeach</hi> to <hi>Stanground</hi> (by the tract of <hi>Mourton Leame</hi>) as now it is from <hi>Wisbeach</hi> to <hi>Guyherne.</hi> And I am very confident that if <hi>Neene</hi> were made a hundred foot broad, and ſo deepe as it is in <hi>Wisbeach</hi> Towne, from <hi>Wisbeach</hi> to <hi>Stanground, Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Fens</hi> in a few yeares would be as fruitfull and rich as ever they were in <hi>Malmesburies</hi> time, whoſe ſtory is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they repreſented a very Paradiſe, for that in pleaſure and delight, it reſembled Heaven it ſelfe, in the very Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes bearing trees, that for their straight tallneſſe, and the ſame without knots, ſtrive to touch the Stars: A Plaine is there as even as the ſea, which with green graſſe allureth the eye; ſo ſmooth and levell, that if any walk along the fields they ſhall finde nothing to ſtumble at; there is not the leaſt parcell
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64729:5"/>
of ground that lieth waſte and void there. Here ſhall you finde the Earth riſing ſome where for Apple trees: there ſhall you have a field ſet with Vines, which either creep upon the ground, or mount on high upon poles to ſupport them: A mutuall ſtrife there is betweene Nature and Husbandry, that what the one forgetteth, the other might ſupply and produce: What will be ſaid of the faire and beautifull buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Levell of Low-Lands, whereof <hi>Thorney</hi> is a part, is almoſt compaſſed about with high Lands, and lyeth betwixt the high Lands and the Sea. The ſuperficies thereof being generally as high as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Sea in ordinary Tides, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Neape Tides; But foure or five foot lower than the ſuperficies of the Sea, when the Sea is at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which is in the Spring Tides, whereof ſome doe very much exceed others, being ruled by the windes: Such Tides doe happen twenty or thirty dayes in the courſe of a yeare; ſome yeares more than the moſt, and ſome yeares leſſe than the leaſt, as the ſtormy windes doe force the Spring Tides into the Bay, which is betwixt <hi>Burnham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Winthorp</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire</hi>; whereby it is apparant that the Rivers which are in the Fens cannot empty themſelves into the Sea, but at ſuch times as the Sea floods are returned out of the Rivers to the place from whence they came; By reaſon whereof the Fens are often drowned, two, three, or foure foot deepe, according as the floods are greater or leſſe.</p>
            <p>Betwixt the Fens and the Sea there is much good Land that is improved and defended by ſubſtantiall Bankes made of Clay and Silt, which doe preſerve
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64729:6"/>
them from being drowned by the Sea on the one ſide, and the high land waters on the other: The common Fens being at the leaſt five foot higher than ſome of thoſe lands; ſo that the Sea commeth not neare the Fens by ſix miles, or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>The freſh water Rivers which doe paſſe through this Levell, are principally <hi>Owſe</hi> and <hi>Neene</hi>: the reſt are but branches that doe fall into <hi>Owſe</hi> at their ſeverall diſtances.</p>
            <p>The neereſt way that any part of the River <hi>Owſe</hi> doth run from the high land to the Sea, is thirty ſix miles, but the greateſt part of it runneth fifty ſix miles, or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Neene</hi> runneth through this Levell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it falleth into the Sea, twenty miles, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. So much for the ſcituation and condition of the Fens.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The reaſons why the Fens are drowned, are principally ſix.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, becauſe the ſuperficies of the Fens lyeth low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ſuperficies of the Sea, when the Spring Tides are at the higheſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the high land floods muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſſe through that great Levell of low Lands, having very little deſcent to enforce a ſtreame from the high Lands to the Sea, but at ſuch times as the Sea floods by retiring themſelves doe leave the Rivers empty, which many times is not above eight houres in twenty foure.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon is, the Rivers through which the high Land waters ſhould paſſe, are not large enough to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64729:6"/>
convey them to the Sea, nor are they armed with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient banks to keepe the Sea and Land floods from dilating themſelves over the face of the whole Levell; and it is a hard queſtion, whether the Sea or the Land floods are the moſt potent enemies to the Fenns; but this is moſt certaine, that when the Sea floods and the Land floods meet, as they often times doe, halfe way betwixt the high Lands and the Sea, in that very place like two powerfull enimies joyning in one, they doe over-run the Levell, and drowne it from one end unto the other.</p>
               <p>A fourth reaſon why the Fenns are drowned, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Sea floods, the violence whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo loud a noiſe at the firſt comming into the River <hi>Owſe,</hi> that it is oft times heard by thoſe that are two miles from it; and after the eager is paſt, for the ſpace of foure houres there followeth a mighty flood ſtreame that runneth into the Country neere forty miles; which waters returning more ſlowly, muſt of neceſſity have more time to empty themſelves then was ſpent in receiving them; for thoſe waters which the Sea forces into the Rivers, muſt all returne before the high Country waters can poſſibly be admitted to paſſe. The diſadvantage is very plaine, the high Land waters comming from betwixt the hills are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally running into the Fens, and the Sea floods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually interrupting and repelling them where they ſhould paſſe out of the Fens into the Sea, and will not ſuffer them to run above foure houres in twelve: which is one chiefe cauſe why the Fens neare <hi>Ely</hi> are ſo often drowned.</p>
               <p>A fifth reaſon is the ill diſpoſition of the Sea in thoſe parts, which being troubled by ſtormy windes,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64729:7"/>
doe carry ſuch abundance of Silt or Sand into the Rivers in the Sommer ſeaſon, that for want of a freſh water ſtreame to waſh them back into the Sea, the Rivers are choked and loſt; which Silt or Sands ſoon after the Spring Tides are paſt doe lie dry, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gaine a firmeneſſe, ſo that men and horſes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell upon them; and in the beginning of Winter they doe much hinder the ſtreame of the high land waters as they paſſe to the Sea, untill by many land floods they are removed and waſhed into the Sea from whence they came; but it is ſo long before that can be effected, in regard the high Land floods compared with the Sea floods, are very weake, that when it is done it is too late for the Country, being ſeldome wrought before the end of Winter: The dryer the Sommer is, the more the Rivers are filled and choked with Silt and Sand againſt Winter; and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſeen, that after much drought there falleth much Raine, which oftentimes occaſioneth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Inundations.</p>
               <p>The ſixt and laſt reaſon why the Fens are often drowned, is becauſe there is no Land Eayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſurpluſſage of the waters which proceed from Raine and Snow falling upon the high Lands adjacent to the Fens, and to carry them into thoſe Rivers or Draines which are next unto them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now I have briefly ſhowne the true cauſes why and how the great Levell of Fens are drowned; I will particularly declare what works muſt be made to draine and preſerve thoſe low Lands from Inundation, ſo that the greateſt part of them may be made Culturable grounds.</head>
               <p>TO remove the firſt and ſecond cauſes of Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there muſt be a deſcent gained from the high
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64729:7"/>
Lands to the Sea, which is a work of a double conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and indeed it is one of the greateſt works which is to be effected. The waters in the Fens may be fitly compared to the beame of a paire of Skales when it hangeth Levell, which being raiſed at one end doth at the ſame inſtant ſettle as much at the other; Such a contrivement muſt be made of the fal that is to be gained betwixt the high Lands and the Sea; the one halfe muſt be gained by raiſing the waters next the high Lands by Banks of a convenient heigth, and by ſetling of the waters in that part of the Rivers that is next unto the Sea, which latter work muſt be wrougt by mending and enlarging of the old Rivers and Draines where they are crooked, and where they are too narrow, or too ſhallow, and by placing of Sluces to repell the Sea floods.</p>
               <p>To remove the third impediment, it is neceſſary that every River and Rivolet ſhould be enlarged to ſuch a breadth and depth as may convey the greateſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter floods the neareſt way from the high Land to the Sea, and on either ſide of them to have a continued Bank able to keepe the high Land waters from ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the ſuperficies of the Fens; the Rivers being ſo perfected, there muſt bee many Draines opened which are now loſt, and ſome new made for the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the waters to the next adjacent River. There muſt be alſo many diviſion Dikes which will lead the Raine waters into the neighbouring Draines. The particulars will in this place take up too much time, I will therefore leave them to the Deſigne it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a large Sluce placed upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of <hi>Owſe</hi> that may be able to repell the Sea-floods, and keep up the high Land waters in dry Sommers;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64729:8"/>
of which kinde there is already one upon the River <hi>Neene,</hi> built by the late Earle of <hi>Bedford:</hi> at which time had <hi>Neene</hi> beene enlarged to a ſufficient bredth and depth, from the Sluce to <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and the Banks continued and maintained on both ſides at the ſame heigth that the Southſide Banks were once made, having a Saſſe placed at <hi>Stanground,</hi> as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to keep all <hi>Neene</hi> to <hi>Wisbeach,</hi> the petty draines and diviſion-dikes being alſo made, That ſide of the Fenns will be perfectly drained; but as it is, there is but a part of that work perfected. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Sluces is very chargeable, and ſo difficult, that every Bank-maker doth not underſtand how to place them nor make them; but the advantage which they bring, being well built, cureth the fourth and fifth inconvenience, and indeed is very materiall to the perfect draining of the Fenns.</p>
               <p>The laſt work is a great work, and will coſt much money: It is the making of ſo many Land Eayes as may receive the ſurpluſſage of the waters which doe fall upon the high Lands that are next the Fenns, and convey them to the next River, rivolet, or draine, ſo that they may not offend the neighbouring Fenns.</p>

               <p>To make a Brick Sluce and a Brick Saſſe upon the River <hi>Owſe</hi> neere <hi>Mandlin</hi> Falls, that may have one hundred ſixty foot water-way, with double doors in every Arch to keepe out the Sea floods, and Land doores to keepe up the freſh waters; and thoſe Land doores muſt have Spring doores in them to diſcharge the freſh waters on a ſudden, for the better maintaining and preſerving of the Channell from the Sluce to the Sea. The Sluce, the Sluce-pit, and the caſting of water, together with the cutting of a new River to and from the Sluce, and making of a Dam in the old River, may coſt one and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds.</p>
               <p>To make ſo many Land Eayes as may convey the downfall of all the high Land waters into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtreames, ſo that they may not drown thoſe Fens which are next them, may be a work of one hundred and five miles in length, conſidering one place with another, they may coſt ten ſhillings the rod, which is ſixteen thouſand and eight hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>The purchaſing of Several, through which many of the Draines are to be made, may coſt ſix thouſand pounds.</p>

               <p>The making of diviſion Draines may coſt five thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>The Sallary of Officers imployed in this work may in foure years amount to foure thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>It is knowne to Builders that after great care and examination of their intended charge, there will be ſome Nailes omitted. For which reaſon, if you pleaſe, you may caſt the odde money into this eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and reckon the totall charge to be one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and foureſcore thouſand pounds: and that with this caution, that the Springs of the yeares muſt not be loſt for want of money.</p>

               <p>The placing of a great Sluce upon the River <hi>Owſe</hi> neare <hi>Lyn,</hi> together with thoſe other works which are here deſigned under the title of that River, will draine all the Fenns that are on the Southſide of <hi>Bedford</hi> River, ſo that the greateſt part of them will be culturable grounds; and peradventure it will ſpare the charge of thoſe Banks which are intended to bee made on either ſide of the River <hi>Owſe,</hi> from <hi>Salters Load</hi> to <hi>Little-port.</hi> But the making of that Sluce is a work of ſo great a conſequence, that of my ſelfe I dare not abſolutely reſolve it. It is true that the Fens are drowned by the high Land waters onely; yet an I have ſaid before, the Sea floods are as Potent an

Enemy to the Fenns as the Land floods are. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration wherof, my concluſion is, That the making of a Sluce upon the River <hi>Owſe,</hi> neare <hi>Lyn,</hi> to keepe out the Sea floods, will undoubtedly prevent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move one halfe of that cauſe which occaſioneth the drowning of that great and rich Levell.</p>
               <p>The objections that will be made againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that Sluce will be three: And under favour of this Honourable Court, I conceive they will bee weak in compariſon of the great benefit which that work will produce by keeping out the Sea floods.</p>
               <p>The firſt objection is, the greatneſſe of the charge.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, the hazzard in placing of it.</p>
               <p>The third is, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and <hi>Lyn</hi> will make againſt it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth principally of three parts.<list>
                     <item>The firſt and greateſt is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the repulſing of the Sea floods will impaire <hi>Lyn</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or not.</item>
                     <item>The ſecond is, that for want of a flood Stream, the Keeles muſt of neceſſity make leſſe ſpeed in their paſſage from <hi>Lyn</hi> to <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>The third and laſt objection will be, Some loſſe of time by ſtaying the Keeles at the Sluce, in regard they muſt take their turnes in paſſing through it; which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leave to the grave conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this Honourable Court.</item>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64729:15"/>Being ſerious for the Fens, theſe objections were once ſtrooke out; for it is not a queſtion whether this be the beſt way to Drain the Fens or not. Theſe doubts therefore were only inſerted in regard of <hi>Lyn</hi> Haven, and the Navigation from <hi>Lyn</hi> to <hi>Cambridge</hi> (as is ſaid before.) But being awfull of what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this Great Councell, I durſt not omit them: And now having with all care and diligence fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my Deſigne, I earneſtly implore your Noble acceptance, humbly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you to heare all, chuſe the beſt, and God grant the Kingdom may flouriſh in your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reſolves.</p>
