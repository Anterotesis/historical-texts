            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To Christian parentes, and Housholders, grace, and mercie in Christ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He blessings of God powred vpon this Realme, in so great abundance, as the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, peace, prosperitie and wealth, vnder the rule and gouernement of our merciful Queene, causeth me in thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing to ioy. But the contempt and abuse of these blessinges, mingleth my ioy with greefe and causeth Gods children for sorow to mourne and lament. And this gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Gods Spirite in his children, shall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of children, and maisters of housholdes (though manie other do greeuously offend) especially answeare for before GOD. The great blessinges sent of God, the lawes made by the Prince, the woorde preached by the Ministers, take small effect, and bring foorth little fruite: because parentes and maisters shew such examples of loose libertie in them selues, and throwe the raines of licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into the neckes of others. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not the honourable calling whiche they haue of the Lorde, that he hath placed
<pb facs="tcp:21419:3"/>
them as it were in his owne roome, and geuen them his own names, that they might gouerne, teache, and direct others, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and serue him, vppon whom their preeminence doeth wholy depende. But (alas) they do not their duetie in gouerning, they applie not themselues in teaching them that are committed to their charge: and therefore youth not gouerned, nor taught, nor praying at home, can not pray, nor learne in the congregation. But as the deuises of men are ready to find excuses, so seke they vp figge leaues in this, to couer their shame. First they wil say, We geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meate &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for their worke, what should we do more? So do you bestowe vpon your beasts, in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; feeding them: but your seruantes are more pretious in the eye of the Lord, &amp; you are charged in the fourth commaundement, to see that they serue GOD. Some say, they sende them to the Church on the Sabbaoth, and so answeare that charge: But the Lorde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth you your selues also to rehearse his lawes to your children and housholdes. <hi>Deu. 6.7.</hi> If they plead ignorance, it wil be but a weake answeare to the Lord. Some say, they are ashamed to teache and pray with their housholdes. I say, because it is good, they are
<pb facs="tcp:21419:3"/>
ashamed, else euerie thing they are ready to performe with brasen browes in open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Some say, it is hypocrisie to performe their dutie: let such pray for new hearts: for if their owne consciences condemne them of hypocrisie, God is greater than their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. Some say, it will let and hinder their seruantes from worke, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> obiected to <hi>Moses. Exod. 5.4.</hi> But our Sauiour answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such, in his answeare to <hi>Martha, Luke. 10.41.</hi> (This I speake, not to nourse anie in idlenesse, for such should not eate, <hi>2. Thess. 3.10.</hi>) Some say, they shalbe scorned by worldlinges: If you seeke to please men, you are not the seruantes of Christ, <hi>Galat. 1.10.</hi> Yet this was Christes portion, and they are but faint souldiours that flee for a woorde, for we must buckle with the diuell hande to hande, who will not leaue vs, till death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by Apostasie we yeelde to him both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and soules. Some say, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring the vnlearned in letters to this knowledge: but they do not remember, that God geueth knowledge of his mysteries, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the simple that feare him, <hi>Psalme. 25.14.</hi> And in foure monethes space, I haue seene these principles and answeares learned by Gentlemen, Yeomen, Horsekeepers, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes,
<pb facs="tcp:21419:4"/>
Carters, Milkemaides, Kitchen-boyes, &amp; al in that houshold (where these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were obserued) excepting three or foure whose capacitie was but meane &amp; simple, &amp; yet the simplest went not without some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. Some say, youth are so stubborne, that they will abide no such orders: I say, better is the roome of suche then their companie, for if admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s appointed by the Lord, winne them not, auoyde them: and so shalt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the infecting of the rest of thy house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde by them, so shalt thou make others to feare, so shalt thou by making them ashamed of their sinnes, driue them to repentaunce, &amp; principally thou shalt auoyde Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against thee and thy houshold. If thou knowest that thou keepest an ignorant &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Papist, a blasphemous swearer, a disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t subiect, to God, Prince, &amp; Ruler, a licentious and loose liuer, which giueth his bodie to fighting, whooring, and stealing, &amp; his tongue to quarelling, filthie talking, and lying, &amp; thou seeke not to refourme him by the order of God, doest thou not make thy house his stewes, &amp; thy selfe his bawde? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue such, lest God remoue thee. Is it writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vaine, that the plague shall neuer goe from the house where the swerer is? &amp; that it shalbe
<pb facs="tcp:21419:4"/>
full of plagues? Will not the Lord perfourme that which he hath spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his prophet <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie.</hi> 5.5. That there shal remain a plague in such houses, to consume them with the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber &amp; stones therof? I would they would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what God saide to <hi>Elie</hi> in the like case, Thou honorest thy children aboue me, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wil cut thee and them off.

Turne your musicke to mourning, your feasting to fasting, your riotting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting: and say with Dauid, and with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. <hi>2. Sam. 12.13.

For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our sinnes, &amp; amend our imperfections, and graunt vs the grace of thy holie Spirite, as thou hast fedde vs plentifully, that we may serue thee faithfully.

            <p>We heartily thanke thee (O merciful father) for all thy blessings bestowed vpon vs from the beginning of the world, to this time, for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, our creation, our redemption, our sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and continuall preseruation: namely,

               <hi>Q.</hi> How many sacramentes are there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Two, Baptisme, and the Lordes Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> In Baptisme, which is the signe that may be seene?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Water. <hi>Iohn. 1.26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the grace that cannot be seene?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The washing away of sinnes by the bloud of Christ. <hi>1. Iohn. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> In the Lordes Supper, which is the signe that may be seene?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Bread and wine. <hi>Matth. 26.26.27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the grace, that cannot be seene?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The bodie and bloud of Christ. <hi>1. Cor. 10.16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> To the strengthening of our faith, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thinges doe you principally learne by Baptisme?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, as water washeth away the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the fleshe: so the bloud of Christ doth washe awaye sinne from my soule. <hi>Mark. 1.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I am taught to rise to newnesse of life. <hi>Rom. 6.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> For the strengthening of your faith, howe many thinges doe you principally learne in the Lordes Supper?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, as by the hand and mouth, my bodie receiueth bread and wine, so by fayth my soule feedeth of the bodie and bloude of
<pb facs="tcp:21419:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ. <hi>Iohn. 6.35.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, al the benefites of Christes passion, and his righteousnesse, are as surely sealed by it to be mine, as if my selfe had wrought them. <hi>Rom. 4.25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is the bread and wine turned into the body and bloud of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. For if you turne or take away the signe that may bee seene, it is no Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Going to the Supper of the Lorde, what ought a man to doe principally?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Examine himselfe. <hi>1. Cor. 11.28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why ought a man to examine himselfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, because the vnworthie receiuer is guiltie of the bodie and bloude of Christ. <hi>1. Cor. 12.25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, because he prouoketh the Lorde to wrath, and so eateth and drinketh his owne damnation. <hi>1. Cor. 11.29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether may fooles, madd men, or children be admitted to the Supper of the Lorde?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. For they cannot examine themselues <hi>1. Cor. 11.28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> In how many thinges ought a man princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to examine himselfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, whether he hath faith or no.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether he be sorie for his sinnes, &amp; doth detest and abhorre them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21419:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, whether he hath sought reconciliation with them to whom he hath geuen offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> God knoweth before wee aske what wee neede, so that he neede not to be put in mynd, he is not slouthfull that he neede to be stirred vp, he hath appointed in his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce what he wil bestow, how, and when, therefore why should we pray?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, to stirre vp our selues to seeke him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to exercise our selues in meditating vpon his promises.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that we may discharge and vnloa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How manie thinges ought we to be carefull of in prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. 5.</hi> First that we pray to God through Christ. <hi>Iohn. 16.23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that we be inwardly touched with that we pray for. <hi>Rom. 8.26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they be grounded vpon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. <hi>1. Iohn. 5.14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that wee bee not wearie of prayer, <hi>Luke. 18.1.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, he is to pray for the poore as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his substance and dainties shall doe him no good without Gods blessing.</p>

            <p>WE heartily thanke thee, O mercifull father, for that thou hast bestowed the inestimable treasure of thy holy woorde vppon vs most vile and sinfull wretches. And sith it is not in him that pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth, nor in him that watereth, but in thy mercifull hand to mortifie our sinfull lustes, and to create new hearts in vs, we beseech thee so to order and direct vs, that we proue not like the greene figge tree flourishing without fruite, nor be of the number of those hypocrits, which with tongue can say Lorde Lorde, in thy name can prophesie, cast out diuelles, and do many great woorkes, and yet are condempned for wicked because their heartes are not right: nor like to them, which are swept and garnished, but emptie, wherevnto the vncleane spirit returnes with seuen worse than himselfe, and so our ende be worse than our beginning. But gouerne vs with thy spirit, that in hart we may loue &amp; seeke thee, and in body and soule obey and serue thee in righteousnesse and holinesse all the dayes of our life. And here we offer vp vnto thee our selues, our soules, our bodies, our liues, and all that we haue, in assurance, that that cannot perishe whiche is committed to thee. Take vs into thy hande, and keepe vs this night, that

our bodies may sleep, &amp; our soules may watche for the comming of thy sonne Christ, that so both our bodies and soules may be the more apt and the better able to serue thee, in that estate and calling, wherein it shall please thee to place vs. As we pray for our selues, so we beseech thee to looke with fauoure vppon thy whole Churche, increase the number of thy children, graunt thy Gospell a free passage, comfort the comfortlesse, raise vp them that are fallen, and strengthen them that stande, that they fal not: haue mercie vppon this Realme, long continue thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes of peace and quietnesse towardes vs, and remoue farre from vs al let<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
