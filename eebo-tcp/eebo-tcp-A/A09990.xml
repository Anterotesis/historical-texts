            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T had beene much
to haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
(if it had so pleased the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Spirits)</hi>
that this worthy
man had survived the publishing of
these, and other his Lectures: for
then, no doubt, they would haue come
forth more refined, and digested; For,
though there was very little or no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="tcp:2062:3"/>
in taking them from his mouth,
yet preaching, and writing haue their
severall graces. Things liuened by the
expression of the speaker, sometimes
take well, which after, vpon a mature
review, seeme eyther superfluous, or
flat. And we oft see men, very able
to render their conceipts in writing,
yet not the happiest speakers.</p>
            <p>Yet we, considering not so much what
might haue beene, as what now may be
for the service of the Church, thought
good rather to communicate them
thus, then that they should die with the
Author. He was a man of an exact
judgement, and quicke apprehension,
an acute Reasoner, actiue in good,
choyse in his notions, one who made it
his chiefe ayme to promote the cause
of Christ, and the good of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:2062:3"/>
which moved him to single out argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
answerable, on which he spent
his best thoughts. He was honoured
of <hi>God</hi> to be an instrument of much
good, wherevnto he had advantage
by those eminent places he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto. As he had a short race to
run, so he made speed, and did much
in a little time. Though he was of an
higher elevation, and straine of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
then ordinarie, yet out of loue to
doe good, he could frame his conceits
so, as might sute with ordinary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
A little before his
death (as we were informed by the
Right Honourable the Lord Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Say,</hi> and <hi>Seale,</hi> in whose pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
wisedome, and fidelittie, he put
great repose) he was desirous that
we should pervse what of his was fit

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2062:4"/>We are not Ignorant, that it is a
thing subject to censure, to seeme
bold, and wittie in another mans
worke, and therefore as little is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
as may be. And we desire the
Reader, rather to take in good part,
that which is intended for publique
good, than to catch at imperfections,
considering they were but taken, as
they fell from him speaking. And we
intreate those, that haue any thing of
his in their hands, that they would
not be hastie, for private respects, to
publish them, till we, whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
put in trust, haue pervsed them.
We purpose (by <hi>Gods</hi> helpe) that
what shall be judged fit, shall come
forth. We send forth these Sermons
of <hi>Gods All-Sufficiencie,</hi> and
<hi>Mans Vprightnes,</hi> and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

of Grace</hi> first, as being first
prepared by him that had the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>GENESIS 17. 1.</bibl>
                  <q>When Abraham was ninetie yeares olde and nine,
the Lord appeared vnto Abraham, and sayd vnto
him, I am GOD All-sufficient, walke before me,
and be thou vpright, or perfect.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause, in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all the Duties
of Sanctification, <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>
is all in all, therefore
I haue chosen this Text,
that you may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
It is true; many
things are very excellent,
if they be right: There is no question but the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
is very precious, if it be a true Diamond,
but if it be false, it is nothing worth; If you take a
precious Balme, you make no question of the
thing, and of the excellency of it in generall, all
the question is, whether it be right or no, And so
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2062:6"/>
in the graces of <hi>Gods</hi> spirit, especially, seeing they
concerne our salvation; It much concernes vs, to
know whether they be right or counterfeit; and
therefore you see the condition, that <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
here of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is, that he be <hi>vpright,</hi> and
<hi>perfect,</hi> without <hi>hypocrisie;</hi> (so the word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
<hi>walke before me without hypocrisie.</hi> Now we
haue rather chosen this Text than another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sets forth the ground of all <hi>sinceritie,</hi> and
<hi>perfect walking with God,</hi> which is, even this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
well setled in the heart, that <hi>God is All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient:</hi>
for this is the <hi>Lords</hi> precept, <hi>Walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, and be thou perfect,</hi> or <hi>vpright,</hi> or <hi>sincere,</hi>
let it not be in <hi>hypocrisie:</hi> and this is the motiue
that he vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th to perswade him to it, <hi>I am All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
as if he should say, if there were any defect
in me, if thou didst neede or couldest desire any
thing that were not to be had in me, and thou
mightest haue it elsewhere, perhaps thy heart
might be imperfect in walking towards me, thou
mightest then step out from me to take in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
elsewhere; but seeing <hi>I am All-sufficient,</hi>
since I haue enough in me to fulfill all thy desires,
since I am every way an adaequate obiect, that if
thou lookest about, and considerest all that thy
soule can wish for, thou maiest haue it in me, why
then shouldest thou not consecrate thy selfe to me
alone? Why then shouldest thou be vneven in thy
wayes, serving me sometimes, by fits, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the creature? for there is nothing in the
creature, but thou maiest finde it in me, <hi>I am All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient.
I am All-sufficient,</hi> therefore <hi>walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, and be perfect.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2062:6"/>Yet these words containe somewhat more,
which you may see by that which followes, <hi>I will
make my Covenant betweene me and thee, and I will
multiplie thee exceedingly.</hi> The ground of all our
<hi>sinceritie</hi> is the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that is betweene <hi>God</hi> and
vs. Now these words doe the most briefly, that I
finde, of any in the Scriptures, expresse the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
betweene <hi>God</hi> and vs on both sides, for they
are but the summe of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which in other
places of Scripture is explicated, and set forth
more at large; so that the opening of the <hi>Covenant</hi>
on both sides, is the ground of all the <hi>sinceritie,</hi>
of all that obedience that we yeeld to <hi>God:</hi> And
therefore, I say, you shall not onely haue occasion
from this Text, to examine the graces of <hi>Gods</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in you, and the actions that flow from them,
whether they be <hi>sincere</hi> or <hi>perfect,</hi> but likewise we
will shew you the ground of this <hi>sincerity</hi> whence
it ariseth; and how it is wrought in every mans
heart. And thus these words containe the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
sayth the Lord to <hi>Abraham, I will be thy
God.</hi> On the other side; <hi>thou shalt be mine.</hi> Now

And this is the <hi>Covenant</hi> on <hi>Gods</hi> part.
Now that which is required on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part,
is, that he be the <hi>Lords,</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> is his, for so you
see in the words following. The question onely
is, in what manner <hi>Abraham</hi> shall be the <hi>Lords;</hi>
how that shall be declared? Sayth he, It is not an
emptie relation, but thou must shew that thou art
mine by <hi>walking before me.</hi> And yet it must not be
any kinde of <hi>walking before the Lord,</hi> but it must
be a <hi>perfect walking before him; Walke before me, and
be perfect,</hi> and therefore it is added, <hi>I will make
my Covenant,</hi> that is, this is the <hi>Covenant,</hi> of which
<hi>Circumcision</hi> was but a Signe, for it was instituted
presently, as we see in the words following.</p>
               <p>There are three especiall poynts that we will
gather out of the words.</p>
               <p>The first is from the connexion, and we will
begin with that, because it is a preparation to the
other two: In that the <hi>Lord</hi> vseth this as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Abraham, I am All-sufficient,</hi> therefore
<hi>walke before me, and be thou perfect;</hi> We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
this; that
<q>The cause of all departure from God,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evennesse
in our wayes towards God,<note place="margin">Doubting of Gods All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience, the cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God.</note> is from
hence, that we doe not thinke God to be All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As on the other side, the cause of all our <hi>sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
and <hi>perfectnesse,</hi> ariseth hence, that we doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him to be <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> This you see e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2062:7"/>
ariseth from the words; for thence is the
force of the Argument, <hi>I am All-sufficient,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>walke before me, and be perfect.</hi> My <hi>Beloved,</hi>
it is evident, that the cause of every mans keeping
off from <hi>God,</hi> the cause of his vnevennesse after
he is come in to him, is from hence, that men
thinke not <hi>God,</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> for if a man
had enough in the <hi>Lord,</hi> he would never goe out
from him; but because he wants something, he
desires something that is not in him, or he feares
something, that he thinkes he cannot keepe off
from him: hence it comes to passe that he steppes
out from <hi>God,</hi> he goeth out of the wayes of his
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. And therefore I say, the cause of
every mans departure from <hi>God,</hi> the cause of his
keeping off from <hi>God,</hi> or of his vnevennesse in the
wayes of <hi>God,</hi> is from hence, that he thinkes not
<hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> and this you shall see in
three sorts of men.</p>
               <p>First, there is a generation of men, that liue as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>without God in the world,</hi> and that looke not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>God</hi> at all, that make conscience of nothing;
and what is the reason of that? but because they
thinke, they haue sufficient of their owne, and
therefore they <hi>walke in their owne wayes,</hi> and stand
vpon their owne bottom, and they loue thern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and serue themselues altogether; and apply
not themselues to the <hi>Lord</hi> at all: and therefore
whensoever any man is brought vnto <hi>God,</hi> the
worke is, to take him off from his owne bottom,
to shew him his owne <hi>insufficiency</hi> in himselfe,
and the emptinesse of himselfe, and of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2062:8"/>
and the <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> that is in <hi>God,</hi> and
vpon this ground, he comes in to him. As you
know,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> the <hi>Prodigall Sonne,</hi> when he saw that he
could not subsist longer, but he must perish, if he
stayed where he was; and saw againe, if he
went home to his <hi>Fathers house, there was meate
enough:</hi> this was that that moved him to go home:
this course the <hi>Lord</hi> takes with all whom he
brings home to him;<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> as we see in the <hi>Iaylor:</hi>
and in those <hi>Act.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Act 2.</note> 
                  <hi>They were pricked in their
hearts;</hi> and in <hi>Paul,</hi> when the <hi>light shined</hi> about
him, and he was stricken from his horse, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note>
It was all but to shew them their vanitie, to take
them off from their owne bottoms, to shew them
their owne <hi>insufficiency,</hi> and then he discovered
that <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> that was in himselfe; for no
man will change but for the better, he will not
deny himselfe, and leaue what he hath, till some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is better be propounded vnto him:
So, I say, the cause why men come not in is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they haue an opinion of <hi>sufficiency</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and in the creature, and they apprehend
not an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in <hi>God:</hi> that is, an <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi>
to be in him alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second fort of men are such as doe come in,
and performe many things, and <hi>bring forth some
fruit,</hi> and become professors of the <hi>feare of God,</hi>
and yet they doe it not throughly, But by halues;
the cause of this is likewise from hence, that
they doe not apprehend <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi>
for it they did, they would be <hi>perfect</hi> with him;<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note>
as we see the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Ground</hi> (for that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2062:8"/>
                  <hi>Parable</hi> doth but shew you the kindes of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors)
they were all such as professed the feare of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> that are there spoken of, for we see, they
<hi>brought forth fruit, They received the Word with
Ioy.</hi> What was the reason the <hi>second Ground</hi> was
not <hi>perfect</hi> with the <hi>Lord?</hi> Because they thought
him not to be a <hi>Buckler</hi> strong enough to beare
off all evills, to beare off all persecution. What
was the reason the <hi>Third Ground</hi> did it not? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they thought there was something in <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
in <hi>pleasures,</hi> in <hi>divers lusts,</hi> that they could
not haue in the <hi>Lord,</hi> so they departed from him:
Onely the <hi>Fourth Ground</hi> kept close, because they
did apprehend all to be in the <hi>Lord</hi> that they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they did apprehend him to be strong enough
to deliver them from all the things they feared.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p>The third sort of men are such as are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
which yet are subiect to many slips and falls,
to many turnings aside: And the cause of all this
is, that they apprehend not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>
As, for example, what was the reason that
<hi>Abraham</hi> when he went downe into <hi>Egypt</hi> (being
driven thither by reason of Famine) saved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with a lye, saying that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his <hi>Sister,</hi>
and not his wife, but because he thought <hi>God</hi> was
not able to keepe him and defend him? If he had
thought him to haue beene <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> he
would not haue done it. What was the reason
that <hi>Moses,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> sent him on a message in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Egypt,</hi> was so backward to performe it; but
because he thought that the <hi>Lord</hi> was not <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> For he hath two reasons why he would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2062:9"/>
not goe; One was, he wanted speech, he wanted
abilitie and gifts; <hi>He was of a stammering tongue;</hi>
And the other was, those were aliue, <hi>that</hi> (he
thought) <hi>sought his life:</hi> If he had thought that
<hi>God</hi> was able to haue beene with his tongue, to
haue stregthned him, and to haue improved his
gifts, and to haue inabled him to that service: if
he had thought, likewise, that he had beene able
to haue defended him from those <hi>That sought his
life,</hi> he would never haue disobeyed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of <hi>God,</hi> and beene backward to
performe it as he was.</p>
               <p>And so likewise <hi>Rebeccah;</hi> What was the reason
shee vsed that wyle and shift, that inordinate
meanes to bring a good thing to passe, to obtaine
the <hi>blessing,</hi> when <hi>Iacob</hi> and shee joyned in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Isaack,</hi> but because they thought <hi>God</hi> was
not <hi>Sufficient</hi> to performe that Promise? for the
<hi>blessing</hi> belonged to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and no doubt but
he should haue had it in due time. And so it is
in all the faults of the <hi>Saints;</hi> which are hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they apprehend not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>all-sufficient;</hi>
even as it was in the first sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the
<hi>Angels;</hi> What was the reason that <hi>Adam</hi> fell from
<hi>God</hi> at the first? It was because he desired some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he thought he could not finde in the
<hi>Lord,</hi> he desired to <hi>know good and evill,</hi> which
he thought he should not haue in the <hi>Lord,</hi> he
thought the <hi>Lord</hi> had kept it from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he stepped out from the <hi>Lord,</hi> to <hi>eate</hi> that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
vsing that as a meanes to obtaine his desire.
And this, indeed, was the cause of his falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2062:9"/>
So likewise the cause of the falling of the
<hi>Angells. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 6.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> the Apostle saith there, that a
Minister was not to be a young Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oller, least he
<hi>be puffed vp, and fall into the condemnation of the
Divell,</hi> that is, least he be puffed vp, and fall into
the same sinne, for which the <hi>Divell</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
that is, to be puffed vp, that is, to haue
the desires inlarged beyond the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds which <hi>God</hi>
had set them, to desire more then they should
haue, to be <hi>exalted aboue measure,</hi> that measure,
that <hi>God</hi> had appointed them, that is, they desired
more, they looked after more, they thought there
was not an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in <hi>God</hi> for them: This
was the sinne of the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell. And as it
was the cause of their first fall, so it is the cause of
all the sinnes that haue beene committed since.
And the reasons of it in briefe are these:</p>
               <p>First it ariseth from the desire of happines that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
is implanted in every mans nature.<note place="margin">From mans desire of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.</note> Happines, you
know, is a compound which consists of all good
things, so that none must be wanting; there is no
good thing but it must be an ingredient into it.
Now the nature of man is made by <hi>God</hi> to desire
happines, every man naturally desires happines,
and may desire it, if there be any scantnes in this,
if there be any evill that lies vpon him, that is not
removed, or if there be any good that he desires
and wants, that he doth not enioy; (I say) his
heart cannot rest, for he desires happines; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he finde not an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> so that
nothing be wanting, that his heart can desire or
looke after, it is impossible he should cleaue close
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2062:10"/>
vnto him, but he will be readie to step out from
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this will appeare from the nature
of sinne:<note place="margin">From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sinne.</note> the definition that the <hi>Schoole-men</hi> giue
of sinne, (which we may receiue) is this, that it is
the conversion of a man from <hi>God</hi> to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from the <hi>immutable God</hi> to the mutable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
In every sinne there is such a turning of the
soule from <hi>God</hi> to the Creature. Now, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
if a man did finde an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in <hi>God,</hi>
he would never turne from him, nor seeke to the
Creature; even as the <hi>Bee,</hi> if it did finde honey e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in one flower, would not hasten to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but because it doth not, it goes from flower
to flower: And so is the nature of man (as <hi>Salomon</hi>
expresseth it, saying, that) <hi>He hastened to out ward
things;</hi> that is, when he fell vpon one, he found not
enough in it, he made hast to another and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so the nature of man, if it did finde sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and comfort, and contentment enough in
<hi>God,</hi> it would not turne from him to the creature;
but because, in his sence, the obiect is too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
there is some what he would haue more, he
looks over the Pale, as it were, he seeth something
that he desireth, and that causeth him to step out,
whereas if he had enough at home, if he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in the <hi>Lord,</hi> he would not goe out from
him, to turne inordinately to the Creature vpon
any occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this will appeare likewise from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>sinceritie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritic.</note> and <hi>perfect walking with God,</hi>
for <hi>to walke perfectly with God,</hi> is nothing but this,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2062:10"/>
when a man chooseth <hi>God,</hi> so that he cleaues to
him alone, whereas doublenes of minde stands
in this, when a man is distracted betweene <hi>God</hi>
and some other obiect; I say, betweene <hi>God</hi> and
riches, betweene <hi>God</hi> and credit, betweene <hi>God</hi>
and pleasure, and is sometime applying himselfe
to one, and sometime to another, and so he goes
a double way. So that when a man hath two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
objects, &amp; two principall ends, vpon which
his eye is set, when he hath two inward principles
within, that are the cause of his motion, this way
and that way, such a man is a <hi>double minded man;</hi>
he is a single hearted man that chooseth <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and though he walke imperfectly with him,
yet he chooseth him. Now if a man apprehend
<hi>Gods All-sufficiency,</hi> he will choose him alone, if
he doe not, it is impossible he should choose him
alone, but he will joyne somewhat else with him;
for if he thinke there is but a partiall <hi>sufficiency</hi> in
<hi>God,</hi> and that there is some <hi>sufficiency</hi> in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
besides, it must needs be that he must haue an
eve vpon both; and then his waies will be vneven,
then his <hi>way is vnstable;</hi> and, therefore, I say, the
cause of that instability, to which men are subiect,
is, because they doe not apprehend <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
for you must know this by the way, that
there is a double instabilitie (that word is vsed in
<hi>I am.</hi> 1. 8.<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>A double minded man is vnstable in all his
wayes)</hi> One is an instabilitie between two objects,
which makes vp all the <hi>sufficiency</hi> that he desires,
so that there is part of that <hi>sufficiency</hi> in one, and
part of it in another. The second is an instabilitie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2062:11"/>
in following one object that he hath chosen.
Indeede, the second instabilitie all the <hi>Saints</hi> are
subject vnto, all regenerate men are <hi>vnstable</hi> thus
<hi>in all their wayes,</hi> they cannot sticke fast to <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>walke perfectly</hi> with him. But herein is their
<hi>sinceritie,</hi> they choose him, they pitch vpon him.
Now the ground of it is, they apprehend him
to be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> though this apprehension be
not alwayes kept strong, it is not alway liuely,
and actiue in their minds, their perswasion is not
alway full and present, and therefore they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to step out. So the latter instabilitie befalles
the <hi>Saints,</hi> the former befalles hypocrites, and
both the one and the other instabilitie still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from hence, that we apprehend not <hi>God</hi> to
be <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> Holy men haue that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the maine, but not in a constant tenour at
all times; Hypocrites haue it not so much as in
the maine.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. This truth will likewise appeare from
the nature of <hi>faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offaith.</note> that which makes a man <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
that which sanctifies a man throughout is
<hi>faith:</hi> That which is the cause of all vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in vs is vnbeliefe, for it causeth a man to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> as <hi>Heb. 3. 12. Take heede least
there be in any of you an evill heart of vnbeliefe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the living God.</hi> In this sence <hi>faith</hi> is sayd
to be <hi>accounted for righteousnesse. Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God.</hi> Gen. 15.<note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> indeed made the same
proposition that he doth here, for substance, he
tells him what he would doe for him, and, sayth
the Text, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2062:11"/>
to him for righteousnesse.</hi> Now, <hi>It was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him for righteousnesse,</hi> chiefly, in this sence,
as it is interpreted <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> that his very taking of
the <hi>promise,</hi> and his accepting of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in
that he did receiue that which <hi>God</hi> gaue, that put
him within the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Lord</hi>
reckoned him a <hi>righteous</hi> man, even for that very
acceptation, and beleeving. But that is not all:
but likewise he accounted <hi>faith to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
because <hi>faith</hi> doth sanctifie, and make a
man <hi>righteous:</hi> and therefore <hi>Beloved</hi> (by the way)
wonder not at this, that we put so much vpon
<hi>faith;</hi> for let a man beleeue, that <hi>God is All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
which is the <hi>Covenant,</hi> for <hi>iustifying faith</hi>
is but a beleeving of that part of the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
and inabling a man to keepe the other part, which
is required; and, I say, it makes a man <hi>righteous:</hi>
for when a man beleeues that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
it will cause a man to giue vp himself to the <hi>Lord.</hi>
Againe, when he beleeues the <hi>Lord</hi> to be all in all
things to him, it inableth him to be all in all
things to the <hi>Lord</hi> againe, that is, to be <hi>holy to the
Lord in all manner of conversation.</hi> It knits his
heart vnto the <hi>Lord.</hi> It <hi>sanctifieth</hi> a man <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
it makes him <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> makes him
<hi>wholly</hi> to him. This is the nature of <hi>faith.</hi> (Now
marke it) <hi>faith</hi> could not thus sanctifie, if it did
not beleeue <hi>Gods All-sufficiency.</hi> Againe, vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
could not cause out falling or <hi>departing from
God,</hi> if it were not hence, that we fayle in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some promise of his, or some threatnings,
we thinke there is not an <hi>All-sufficiencie in God:</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:2062:12"/>
you know his promises containe all good things,
if we cleaue vnto him, and his threatnings all evill
things, if we depart from him. If this were fully
beleeved, our hearts would keepe neare to him:
as farre as it is not beleeved, so farre we step out.
Now I say hence <hi>faith purifieth the heart:</hi> It sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth,
is the cause of all righteous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esse that is
wrought by vs: and vnbeliefe is the cause of all
vnrighteousnesse that is wrought by vs. Hence
we gather then, that the perswasion of <hi>Gods All-sufficiency</hi>
keepes a mans heart <hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God:</hi>
and as farre as you come short of this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so farre you are ready to depart from him.
And all the ground of it is, because that which
drawes vs from the <hi>Lord,</hi> is either vaine feares,
or vaine hopes. Those are the two eares as it
were, by which <hi>Sathan</hi> takes euery man, whereby
the drawes him away, out of the wayes of the
<hi>Lords</hi> Commandements. Now if a man did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that <hi>God</hi> were <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> he would be
subiect to none of these false feares, if he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him to be a <hi>Buckler,</hi> that could keepe
him from all ill. Againe, on the other side, if the
did beleeue <hi>God</hi> to be an <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi>
that is, so great a <hi>reward</hi> that there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting in him, that there is a <hi>length, and
breadth, and depth, and height,</hi> in that <hi>reward;</hi> that
his heart hath latitude enough to walke in, he
can dosire nothing out of it: this would free a
man from all vaine hopes, so that the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it would keepe his heart <hi>perfect</hi> Contrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as farre as you faile in either, so farre you are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2062:12"/>
subiect to those two, either false feares, or vaine
and sinfull hopes: and that is the cause of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even
and vnaequall <hi>walking with God,</hi> that we are
not <hi>vpright</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence you may see both the nature of sinne,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
and the cause of all sinne; for it is profitable for vs
<hi>Beloved,</hi> (nothing more profitable than) to finde
out the cause of sinne. It is a Rule that <hi>Physitians</hi>
haue, that a disease, when it is throughly knowne,
(that is, when the cause of it is fully knowne) it is
halfe cured; so it is in the disease of the soule, to
know the very roote and rise, from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
or commeth, to know the principle from
whonco it ariseth, it is a great helpe to vs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, to heale it. But, I say, this will both shew
the nature of sinne, and the cause of sinne in vs.</p>
               <p>First, it shewes the nature of sinne, how evill a
thing it is, yea worse, than, for the most part, we
apprehend it to be; for, if there be no sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but it comes from hence, that you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> then there is <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doldtrie</hi>
(in a manner) committed in every sinne,
that is, you take from <hi>God</hi> and adde another <hi>God</hi>
to him, if you thinke him not to be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi>
whatsoever you seeke to, and youne with him, you
make it <hi>God</hi> as well as he; If it be credite, if it be
honour, if it be pleasures, if it be riches, yea what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is, I say, there is a bitter roote of <hi>Idolatrie</hi>
in the commission of every sinne, that makes it
<hi>out of measure sinfull.</hi> This we may consider by
the way, but this I purpose not to stand on; the
thing that I would chiefly presse, is to finde out
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2062:13"/>
the cause of sinne, the cause of that hollownesse,
and that imperfectnesse, and insinceritie that is in
the hearts of men towards <hi>God,</hi> which, I say, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from hence, that they apprehend not <hi>God</hi> to
be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> for this (for the most part) is the
case of men, if they did not apprehend some suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
in him, they would not seeke him at all;
againe, if they did apprehend him to be <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
they would serue him <hi>perfectly:</hi> but this
middle apprehension in men, that they thinke
there is a sufficiencie in the <hi>Lord,</hi> but not an <hi>All-sufficiencie;</hi>
this is the cause why the hearts of
men are hollow towards the <hi>Lord.</hi> Even as when
a man lookes towards a great man, that is a man
ofsome power, able to doe him hurt, and that
hath some abilitie to doe him good: this makes
him to feare, it makes him carefull to please him,
and to abstaine from what may offend him: yet,
because he thinkes he is not perfect with him,
that his heart is but hollow towards him, he doth
it not fully. So it is in our <hi>walking before God.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we apprehend him not to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
therefore it is that our hearts are not <hi>perfect</hi> with
him.<note place="margin">Instances.</note> We shall best shew you this in instances;
for example; What is the reason, that a man is
discouraged in seeking to <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seeking to God in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult cases.</note> in praying to <hi>God,</hi>
in depending vpon <hi>God</hi> in any great case of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
where there is more then ordinarie diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
there is more to be suffred, there is more
to be done, what is the reason of it? because we
apprehend him not to be <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> You know
the turning of men away from <hi>God,</hi> commonly it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2062:13"/>
ariseth from this, they meete with some rub, some
crosses, some barre, <hi>Some Lyon in the way,</hi> which
they are not able to grapple with, it is too strong
for them: and then they turne out of the way;
the reason, I say, of all sinne and departure from
the <hi>Lord,</hi> is, because we doe not apprehend him
to be <hi>All-sufficient:</hi> for if we did, why should not
a man in an easie case, turne from him as well as
in the most difficult? As, for example; <hi>David</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Lord</hi> long, yet when <hi>Saul</hi> grew excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
strong, and he very weake, then he stepped
aside, and sayd in his heart, <hi>I shall perish one day,</hi>
and so he goes out of <hi>Gods wayes,</hi> and flyeth to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis,</hi>
to the <hi>Philistines:</hi> This was from hence, that
he did not apprehend the <hi>Lord</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient</hi>
and <hi>Almightie,</hi> for the word signifieth both.
And so likewise <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. what was the
reason that he started aside, that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
as at other times? When <hi>God</hi> sayd to him,
that he would giue them flesh for a moneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
what sayth <hi>Moses</hi> againe? <hi>Shall six hundred
thousand men be fed with flesh, shall all the Beeues
and Sheepe be slaine, or shall all the fish in the Sea be
gathered together?</hi> He could not beleeue the <hi>Lord:</hi>
here was a difficultie, that <hi>Moses</hi> was not able to
reach, that there should be so many fed with flesh,
and that in the <hi>wildernes,</hi> and that for a moneth
together: he thought it impossible to be done,
that all the fish in the Sea should be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and all little enough to serue such a turne.
Now marke the <hi>Lords</hi> answer there, <hi>is the Lords
hand shortened?</hi> You may know by the medicine,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2062:14"/>
what the disease was. <hi>Moses</hi> (sayth he) thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
I am not able to doe it, thou thinkest my hand
is shortened that I cannot doe it. And the like
was when he came to draw water out of the <hi>rocke:</hi>
you shall see, <hi>Moses</hi> there stucke: for the case was
a case of difficulty. If it had beene out of the earth,
where there had beene probabilitie, it had not
beene so much: but <hi>Moses</hi> makes two arguments
against it, (you know how great the sinne was for
the which he lost going into the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
I say, he makes these two arguments against
it.)</p>
               <p>First, sayth he, the people are <hi>rebels,</hi> and will
the <hi>Lord</hi> giue them water, that haue carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in such a manner? that was one thing that
caused his infidelitie at that time.</p>
               <p>Another was; <hi>What? shall I give you water out of
the rocke?</hi> As if he should say. That is a difficult
thing. So that put these two together, <hi>out of the
rocke,</hi> and <hi>vnto rebels,</hi> there his fayth fayled, for it
was difficult: and whence came this? because he
thought the <hi>Lord</hi> was not <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> And so,
likewise, <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Marie,</hi> when they came to
Christ for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was dead, they were
out of hope: the reason was, because there was a
difficultie now more than before; so that, I say, the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cause of our turning aside from the <hi>Lord,</hi>
is, because we meete with some difficulties which
our faith is not able to grapple with, and it ariseth
from hence, that we forget this, that the <hi>Lord</hi> saith
to <hi>Abraham, I am God All-mightie,</hi> or <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
I am able to doe whatsoever I will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:2062:14"/>Besides this: what is the cause that men seeke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
after vaine-glory,<note place="margin">Seeking praise with men.</note> that they are subiect to enuie?
<hi>(the spirit that is in vs is subiect to envie)</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryman
envieth another, because he desireth vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
too much to himselfe: this ariseth from
hence, that he reckoneth not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>
That is. If we did reckon it enough to haue
praise with <hi>God,</hi> if we thought that his knowledge
of our vprightnesse were sufficient, though no
man in the world knew it besides, we would be
content with that honour that we haue, which he
hath allotted to vs within our owne compasse,
but, because we thinke him not to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
we would haue somthing, likewise, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we would haue honour, loue, and respect
from men; which sinne ariseth hence, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
not him to be <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> so doth that,
likewise, which is contrary to it, (for sinnes of the
same nature &amp; they arise both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d)
when men are so sencible of shame, and reproach,
and disgrace, and disparagement, doth it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
hence, that we reckon <hi>mans day</hi> too much,
and <hi>Gods day</hi> too little? We apprehend not <hi>God</hi>
enough in his greatnesse; as the Apostle saith, <hi>I
reckon not to be iudged by mans day.</hi> As if he should
say. It is but a day, it is but a time that man hath
to judge: there is another day, the <hi>Lords</hi> day, that
great day. If a man did apprehend that which is
in <hi>God,</hi> if he did see his <hi>All-sufficiency,</hi> he would
not regard to be judged by mans day, as long as
he were not judged by the <hi>Lord:</hi> he would not care
what his fellow-prisoners thought of him, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2062:15"/>
long as the Iudge, and the Law cleared him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And so likewise, what is the reason of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even
wayes of men,<note place="margin">Indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses taken to bring enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises to passc.</note> which they take to bring
their enterprises to passe? is it not hence, that
they apprehend not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient? Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
when he was in a strait, when the Kingdome,
you know, was promised him, and many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
he had to haue gotten it, if he would haue
vsed evill meanes, when sometimes the <hi>Lord</hi> put
<hi>Saul</hi> into his hands, yet would not touch him,
but committed it to the <hi>Lord,</hi> for he thought him
to be <hi>almightie,</hi> able to bring it to passe, as also he
did bring it to passe.</p>
               <p>And so likewise, <hi>Daniell;</hi> there might haue
beene meanes vsed for him to haue escaped; you
know how he was in danger, when he refused to
eate of the Kings meate, he was in danger againe,
when they <hi>obtained of the King, that is any man did
make any request to any God or man, but the King for
30. dayes,</hi> he should be put to death: yet he <hi>trusted
in God,</hi> he thought him to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> able to
keepe him, and therefore he stepped not out of
his way. And so <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saw that <hi>Festus</hi>
thought to haue had money give him, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
in those circumstances, he thought it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to doe it, &amp; therefore he <hi>trusted in God;</hi> though
no doubt, he might haue made friends, to haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
the money: It is likely <hi>Festus</hi> thought there
was a probailitie for it, because he hoped for it,
but <hi>Paul</hi> would not doe it, because he thought the
<hi>Lord</hi> was able to deliver him. But on the other
side, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> when he had a businesse to doe, you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2062:15"/>
know what course he tooke, he joynes them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he addes to Religion, he corrupts it, that he
might keepe his Kingdome. And so <hi>Saul.</hi> (But I
need not giue you Instances) I say, the cause of
all indirect waies we take to bring our enterprises
to passe, it comes from hence, that we trust not in
<hi>God,</hi> we thinke him not to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> not
able to doe it, except we helpe him with wyles,
and tricks, and devises of our owne: What is the
reason of that lying and dissembling, that is vsed
likwise, for the same purpose? Is it not from
hence, that men apprehend not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?
Peter,</hi>
when he denied <hi>Christ,</hi> was it not
from feare? And from whence was that feare, but
because he reckoned not <hi>God,</hi> to be a <hi>Buckler</hi>
strong enough, and sure enough? And so <hi>Sarah,</hi>
when shee denied, that shee laughed, sayth the
Text, <hi>for shee was afraid,</hi> and therefore shee sayd,
no, <hi>I did not laugh,</hi> when shee did, and was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for doing of it. I might giue you many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Instances, but I shall not need. Goe through
all varieties of sinnes, and you shall see they arise
hence, that we reckon not <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The satisfying of sinfull lusts,<note place="margin">Satisfying of sinfull lusts.</note> doth it not arise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
from hence? He that is given to any pleasure, to
any delight, of what kinde soever, if he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
those two things, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
him with joy, and comfort sufficient, that the
<hi>Lord</hi> is able to <hi>mortifie</hi> those <hi>lusts,</hi> and to heale
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him, he would keepe close to him, &amp; would
not goe out from him: for he need not, the <hi>Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:2062:16"/>
is <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> That is. He is able to satisfie him,
he is able to fill him with <hi>ioy and peace, through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,</hi>
which should be enough to satisfie his
heart with contentment; he is able, likewise, to
mortifie that lust, so that, as he is forbidden the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
of it, so, likewise, he should haue no such
prevailing desire to it. And therefore (<hi>Beloved</hi>)
the way to keepe our hearts <hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God</hi> (for
that is the thing for which I presse all this, for
which I bring all these instances) it is to come to
this, to set downe this conclusion with our selues,
that he is <hi>All-suffi-cient:</hi> No man is ever fit to
serue him without this: except a man be content
to haue <hi>God</hi> alone for his portion; if he will joyne
any thing with him, if he will joyne <hi>God,</hi> and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
together, <hi>God,</hi> and riches together, <hi>God,</hi> and
pleasures together, he will never keepe close to
him: for one time, or other there will fall out a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
between <hi>God,</hi> and these things, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doth not resolue thus with himselfe, I will
be content with <hi>God</hi> alone, though he strip me of

he is my father, he is willing to doe all things for

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2062:17"/>
with our selues, (if any thing be not done, if we
want any thing, if any crosse lie vpon vs at any
time,) to be readie to say, this is not because the

it is not because the <hi>Lord</hi> will not doe it; for he is
as infinite in loue to me, as he is in power: What
is the reason of it then? because it is not best for
me. So should every man say, if there be any want,
if there be any crosse, it is best for me. It is better
for thee, it may be, to be in a low estate, than to be
in a high: it is better for thee to be pinched with
povertie, than to liue in abundance: it is better
for thee to lie vnder temptation, (though it be a

haue meane gifts, than to haue high gifts: it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for thee, to be in a low place, than to be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
place: it is better for thee, to be crossed in

sicke in bodie, it is better for thee to be troubled
(sometime) in minde, than to be freed from it:
<hi>Beloved,</hi> this we must come to, and yet we must
thinke the <hi>Lord</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> For if it be so,
thou oughtest to say thus with thy selfe, it is best
for me to be so. You wil say, how shall we do to be

                  <hi>Beloved,</hi> there are many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where in we are in such a condition, which we
thinke worst for our selues, which many times is
the best, nay, alwayes it is best for every man that
is in covenant with <hi>God.</hi> For this rule must be
kept, he is <hi>All-sufficient</hi> to his children, and they
finde him so, he hath performed it, and made it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2062:17"/>
good to their experience, and therefore, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they finde any want, it is best for them to be
so: It is not either defect in the power of <hi>God;</hi> or
in the loue of <hi>God:</hi> for example; <hi>Abraham</hi>
thought it a hard thing, a great crosse, that he was
put to expell <hi>Ishmaell</hi> his sonne, whom he loved;
Was it not better for <hi>Abraham?</hi> had he not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sonne that was fitter for him, borne of his
owne Wife? And so <hi>Moses</hi> thought it a hard
thing, to be barred from comming into the land
of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but what lost he by it? was he not led
into a better <hi>Canaan,</hi> into <hi>Paradise,</hi> into a more
glorious condition? So likewise, when he went
downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> if he had had a tongue of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
given him, to his will, that would haue
satisfied him: but was it not better for <hi>Moses</hi> to
haue a stammering tongue, and yet to haue the
worke done as well, <hi>Aaron</hi> and he being joyned
together? For by that meanes <hi>Moses</hi> was kept
humble, and his loue likewise was increased. For
that mutuall indigence knits men together,
when they haue need one of another. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>David</hi> had an exceeding great desire to build
the <hi>Temple,</hi> when it was not the <hi>Lords</hi> will, that he
should doe it; was he a looser by it? <hi>David</hi> was at
that time not fit to haue done it, he was not able
to haue done it, as circumstances were: but was
he a looser by it? had not he a house built him, as
well as if he had built the house of <hi>God?</hi> had not
he as great a reward, as if he had performed it?
So likewise in the losse of his childe, it was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
grievous to him, yet, was it not better that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2062:18"/>
that childe should be taken away, and that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ther should be given him, that was legitimate?
Did not the <hi>Lord</hi> recompence it abundantly to
him, when <hi>Salomon</hi> was given to him in his stead?
And so <hi>Paul,</hi> he was exceeding desirous to be
freed from that temptation, which, no doubt, was
very grievous to him, that did gall, and vexe his
minde continually, even as a <hi>pricking of the flesh</hi>
doth: yet it was much better for <hi>Paul,</hi> it was not
because <hi>God</hi> was not <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> either in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or in loue to him: but he was an exceeding
great gainer by that meanes, he was emptied of
himselfe: for that is the scope of <hi>God,</hi> in the wayes
of his providence towards his children, even to
magnifie himselfe towards them, which cannot be
without emptying them of themselues, by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
to them their owne insufficiencie: and that
is done partly, by affliction, and partly by sinne,
but chiesly by sinne, because that workes more
immediately vpon man, it makes him to see how
little excellencie, and how little worth, there is in
him; it makes him againe to see the glorie, and
the power, and the purenesse of <hi>God,</hi> to magnifie
him, and to humble himselfe; this <hi>Paul</hi> got by it,
and it was better for him, he was in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by it. Therefore I say, this conclusion must
be set downe, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and
when we fall short of any thing that we desire,
lay it not vpon <hi>God,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> is short of his
performance, of any promise, that <hi>he compasseth
vs</hi> not <hi>about with mercie, on every side,</hi> as much as
we need, that he <hi>delivers vs</hi> not <hi>from every evill:</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:2062:18"/>
for he will make that good alway, that <hi>no good
thing shall be wanting to them that lead a godly life:</hi>
He is a <hi>Sunne and a shield</hi> to them. And whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is otherwise, it is because it is not best for
them: but this is a digression; the thing we haue
to doe (for all this is but a preparation) is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you now that the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient:</hi> as
we told you, we handle this poynt first, because
it is a preparatiue to the rest: It shewes you of
what moment it will be so to be perswaded, and
of what evill consequence it is, not to be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded.
Now I will adde a word of the second
poynt; that
<q>God is All-sufficient.<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
                     <note place="margin">God is All-sufficient.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To proue that he is so, I will propound to you
but these two reasons;</p>
               <p>First consider that all that is in the creature,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> all
the comforts, all the excellencie, all the beautie
that is to be found in them, it is but borrowed,
and derived: <hi>God</hi> is the primitiue, he is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
he is the first, the vniversall cause, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
cause of all: hence we gather this, that there
is an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> in him, and in him onely, he
is <hi>All-sufficient</hi> exclusiuely: so that no creature
hath any sufficiencie at all in it selfe: for (<hi>Beloved</hi>)
you must know, that the creature addes nothing
at all to his sufficiencie, but all sufficiency is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in him; for if they be all derived and
borrowed things, then they are in the creature,
but as farre as it pleaseth him to communicate the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2062:19"/>
same to them: now that it is so, see <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 13.<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>My
people</hi> (sayth the <hi>Lord) haue committed two evils,
they haue for saken me the fountaine of living waters,
and</hi> (secondly) <hi>haue digged to themselues pits that
hold no water:</hi> Where we may briefly obserue:
First, that <hi>God</hi> is the spring, from whom all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
come originally, the <hi>pits,</hi> you know, haue the
water, but borrowed and derived from the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;</hi>
secondly, there is something in this, that he
calleth them <hi>pits,</hi> that is, the comfort in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a mixed comfort, it is like water in a <hi>pit,</hi>
it is muddie, and not pure and cleare, like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the fountaine: That is, the comfort that
comes meerely from the creature (if you receiue
any comfort in the creature, and <hi>Gods</hi> hand be
not in it) it is alway mixed with some sorrow,
with some evill, but if it come from the <hi>Lord,</hi> it is
a pure comfort: he giues riches, and no sorrow
with them, Thirdly, the comfort that is in the
creature, it is but a dead comfort, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to that
which is in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and therefore he is sayd to
be a fountaine of living water, that is, running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The comfort that is in the creature, it is able
to doe little, it is quickly spent, and when it is
spent, there is no more in it: but the comfort that
is in <hi>God,</hi> it is like water that commeth out of the
spring, which is still renewed from day to day,
and therefore it is called living water, there is no
end of it, but still it flowes more and more. Last
of all, they are broken pits that cannot hold the
comfort that they haue, thought there be comfort,
yet it is like liquor in a brittle glasse, that is not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2062:19"/>
able to hold this comfort. In the creature, it is but
borrowed comfort, and therefore we see 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.
17.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> (where an instance is given of riches) <hi>Charge
those that are rich in this world, that they be not high
minded, that they trust not in vncertaine riches, but
in the living God, that giveth all things abundantly
to enjoy.</hi> Marke, you shall see there the difference,
that they trust not in vncertaine riches, but in the
living <hi>God,</hi> (that is) riches are but dead things,
<hi>God</hi> is the living <hi>God:</hi> they are able to doe but
some things for you; <hi>God</hi> giues you all things, and
giues abundantly. And againe, if riches doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yet the enjoying they are not able to giue;
but the <hi>Lord</hi> giues vs all things abundantly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.
Now, when we consider, that whatsoever is
in the creature, it is but a borrowed and derived
comfort, then the sufficiency is wholly in the <hi>Lord,</hi>
he is the <hi>God of all comfort;</hi> as the Sunne is the
cause of all light, whatsoever the ayre hath, it is
derived from the Sunne, so whatsoever is in the
creature, it is derived from <hi>God:</hi> and therefore this
is one ground, why wee should perswade our
selues, that he is <hi>All-sufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> is this, he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> because
he onely can be the author of good and evill:<note place="margin">God onely the author of good &amp; evill.</note> that,
you know, which can doe neither good nor evill,
there is no sufficiency in it at all; Now that is the
propertie of the <hi>Lord,</hi> as we see <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 5.<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 5.</note> a place
worthy our consideration; <hi>The Idols stand vp as a
palme-tree, but they speake not; they are borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot goe; feare them not, because they can
doe neither good nor evill:</hi> this is the argument,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2062:20"/>
whereby the <hi>Lord</hi> proveth them to be Idols, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they can doe neither evill not good: as if he
should say, if they could doe either evill or good,
they were <hi>Gods,</hi> and not Idols. The same we may
apply to any creature, considered in it selfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the influence and concourse of <hi>God:</hi> If it were
able to doe either good or evill, you might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
it as <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> onely can doe good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
of himselfe. My <hi>Beloved,</hi> if we could bring
our hearts to this perswasion, that it is the <hi>Lord</hi>
onely, that can doe good and evill, we would then
cleaue to him, it could not be, that we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from him vpon any occasion, for that which
is able to doe neither good nor evill, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne:
if your opinions were such of the creature,
that it were, without <hi>God,</hi> neither able to do good
nor evill, you would never turne from <hi>God</hi> to any
creature, vpon any occasion: for certainely, he is
able to doe both good and evill, he onely can
make every manslife, comfortable, or vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
it is his prerogatiue royall, it belongs to
him alone. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> it is sayd, a man is <hi>not able to
make one haire white, or blacke;</hi> so small a thing he
is not able to doe: and in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note> it is sayd more
plainely, if we be not able to doe the least thing,
we be not able to doe the greatest. That place,
you know, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Amos. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>shall there be evill in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> The Scripture is
plentifull in this; I should loosetime to vrge pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
I say, there is no creature in heaven or earth,
that is able to be the author of the least good, or
the least hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2062:20"/>But you will say to me,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> we finde it otherwise in
experience; we finde that they are able to doe vs
good, and to doe vs hurt.</p>
               <p>You haue an answer for that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 11.<note place="margin">Answ. Ioh. 19. 11.</note> when
<hi>Pilate</hi> sayth to our Saviour, <hi>haue I not power to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
thee, or to loose thee?</hi> He answereth, no: thou
hast none at all of thy selfe: Indeed, thou hast a
power, but it is <hi>given thee from aboue,</hi> thou hast
not a jot more then is distributed to thee: if you
compare that with <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28.<note place="margin">Act. 4. 28.</note> you shall see it was
so; <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> joyned together, to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<hi>God</hi> had appointed before: they did not the
least evill, but <hi>God</hi> had appointed it: And so it is
with all the creatures, the principall creatures,
that we haue to doe with, and that we see before
vs, even men, they doe vs not (without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
the least good, not the least hurt. When
<hi>shemei</hi> cursed <hi>David,</hi> you know, what expression
he vsed; <hi>The Lord hath bid shemei curse,</hi> as if he
should say, <hi>shemei,</hi> nor any man else in the world,
could not moue his tongue, if <hi>God</hi> did not say to
such a man, goe curse him, goe and reproach him.
It is sayd of <hi>Pull</hi> and <hi>Tiglapellazer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tiglath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pileser.</note> Kings of <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
that the <hi>Lord</hi> stirred them vp, and they carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his people away captiue: if <hi>God</hi> had not stirred
vp their spirits, they had not done the least thing.
You know, oft it is sayd, the King of <hi>Ashur the
stasse in my hand;</hi> and so <hi>Cyrus</hi> is sayd to be his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
he stirred him vp, he was his Shepheard, to
doe whatsoever he desired to his sheepe.<note place="margin">Isa. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.
Now if a man be able to doe nothing, but as farre
as <hi>God</hi> sets him on worke, then much lesse can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2062:21"/>
ther things, as riches, and the like, they can doe
no more then men can doe: for what serue they
for, but to set men a worke; so, honour, and credit,
and estimation, which men so much esteeme,
they can doe no more then men can doe; for they
set men on worke to doe good, as reproach sets
them on worke to doe hurt. Now if there be no
man, nor no creature in heaven or earth, that can
doe good or hurt, (<hi>Beloved</hi>) why should we be
servants to men? why should we be subiect to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
delights? to carnall feares? to carnall hopes,
and the like? surely, it is hence, we over-value the
creature, we thinke it is able to doe something,
we thinke that there is some suffciency in that,
and not <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in <hi>God:</hi> certainely, all the
Commandements of <hi>God,</hi> are grounded vpon
cleare reason, if we were able to finde it out: But
now when the <hi>Lord</hi> requires at our hands, that
we worship him altogether; <hi>Thou shalt haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods but me,</hi> thou shalt serue me onely, thou
shalt bestow thy selfe wholly vpon me, thou shalt
be <hi>perfect</hi> with me, as you see here: surely, it is
vpon this ground, thou shalt haue all from me,
and therefore thou shalt doe all to me. If any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were able to doe good or hurt, without the
<hi>Lord,</hi> if they had any part or portion with him in
being authors of our good, certainly, they should
haue a portion of our service: for there is reason
and equitie in it, that that which doth vs good, in
such manner, we should seeke vnto it, we should
serue it: and likewise, if it could doe vs hurt; but
now in that the <hi>Lord</hi> challengeth all to himselfe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2062:21"/>
(I say) it is vpon this ground, <hi>I am All-sufficient:</hi>
there is no creature is able to adde to me more or
lesse: and therefore (<hi>Beloved</hi>) consider the ground
of it, and let the equitie of it establish your hearts
to be <hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> that he onely is able to
make your liues comfortable, or vncomfortable.
Put the case, a man hath a great addition to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
put the case, he hath much credit, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
among men: put the case, he haue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Princes, that are most able and powerfull
among men: if the creature be able alone, to doe
neither good nor hurt, they shall not make the
least addition to his happines; and if it be so,
why should we esteeme it so much? if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
side, it turne against vs, it shall not doe vs the
least hurt. Should not this free vs, from fearefull
perplexities, from vaine hopes, and vaine feares?
should it not keepe our hearts <hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> if
we were thus perswaded? for, what are all the
creatures? are they not like servants in the great
house of the world, and we as children? and the
servants are all at the Maisters command, to doe
whatsoever he hath appointed: if we want any
thing, he can appoint them to provide for vs;
there is not any creature in heaven or earth, that
stirreth without a command, without a warrant
from the maister of the house: if he doe command
them, they goe: they are readie and nimble to doe
vs any service: this is the nature of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
we haue to doe with. Thinke with your
selues then, it is no great matter for them; if the
Maister of the house be our friend, they are all at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2062:22"/>
his command; you know those meane creatures,
the <hi>Caterpillers:</hi> are they not all the <hi>Lords</hi> host,
that goe and come as he bids them, as <hi>Ioel 2.?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> So
the meanest creatures, the fire, and the ayre, and
whatsoever they are, they are all at the <hi>Lords</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
and therefore thinke not, that the creature
is able to doe any thing for vs.</p>
               <p>There are but two things, one is our everlasting
happines,<note place="margin">The creature cannot helpe to eternall happines.</note> and there the creature by fruition of it
selfe, is able to doe nothing; there it is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
for it is inferiour to vs. Besides, there is a
curse vpon the creature, there is an emptinesse in
it: besides, <hi>it is vnder the Sunne,</hi> and therefore it
cannot helpe to the happines, that is aboue the
Sunne. These arguments you shall finde in <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes.</hi>
Besides, it is temporall, whereas we must
haue an eternall happines; for, our soules are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
and therefore, for eternall happines: for
the chiefe good of man, the creature is nothing at
all, it helpeth but in particulars. Take credit, it
doth but helpe against ignominy and obscuritie:
learning doth but helpe against ignorance: health
is but a remedie against sicknesse, and distemper
of bodie: riches are but an helpe against pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and so goe over all the creatures in the world.
But the <hi>Lord</hi> is vniversally good, he giues vs all
things, and therefore <hi>godlines is profitable for all
things:</hi> he giues vs all things to enioy: that is, he
fills the soule of man every way, not, <hi>Beloved,</hi> that
simply an infinite object is necessary, as it is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vnderstood, (I see no ground for that) I see
it not necessary, that a finite facultie, should haue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2062:22"/>
an infinite obiect, if that which is proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
be enough; but this I affirme withall, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>God</hi> were infinite, he could not satisfie the
soule of man, for this is the nature of the soule, if
it finde a bottom in any particular, it passeth over
that, and hasteth after more, and, therefore, in all
particular creatures (you see) when we haue had
once tryall of them, when we haue had the inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and possessing of them, we leaue them and
seeke after that which we want. Now the <hi>Lord</hi>
giues vs satisfaction, because the contentment,
the happines, that we haue from him, is without
a bottom, it is without limits, that, when we haue
had never so much, still there is more to be found
in him; and hence it is, in regard of the vniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
he hath all things in him, he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
and, in regard of the latitude, when we enioy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much, still there is more behind in him,
and therefore he onely hath to doe in that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in making vs eternally happie, in giving vs
that <hi>summum bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the helpe that the creature giues for the
things that belong to this life: there, I confesse,
the creature hath somewhat to doe, but it doth it
all as an instrument, and if it doth all as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then the creature doth nothing, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
we thanke not the hand, but the minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that moues the hand to doe a good turne,
much lesse dowe thanke a dead, inanimate instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Let vs looke vpon every creature, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man as <hi>Gods</hi> instrument; when any man doth
you a kindnesse, when any man doth you a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2062:23"/>
or doth you good, say as the Scripture
phrase is; <hi>The Lord hath given me favour in his
sight; he stirred vp his spirit.</hi> And so, when he doth
vs hurt, say such a man is but a meere <hi>viall,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
whereby the <hi>Lord</hi> hath powred out
some part of his displeasure vpon me. This will
cause your eye to be vpon the <hi>Lord</hi> altogether;
you will over looke men, not regarding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
or advancement by them;
nor the contrary; for in all these
things, they are but instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And so much
for this time.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that he is so to every one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First,<note place="margin">That God is <hi>All-sufficient</hi> in himselfe.</note> I will shew that he is so in himselfe; for,
except <hi>he</hi> haue an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in himselfe, he
cannot communicate it to another. Thought this
be a poynt that we all beleeve,<note place="margin">Difference betweene the <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and that which is in the creature</note> yet the opening of
it will not be vnprofitable to you, and, therefore,
you must know, that he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the creature may be <hi>All-sufficient:</hi> for there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2062:24"/>
is this difference betweene him and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The Angels and blessed men, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
they, in their kinde,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> may haue an <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,</hi>
but it is such an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> as belongs to
them, in such a spheare, and such an order, and
measure: as the creature, that hath all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the life that it leads, it hath an <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie</hi>
sutable to it selfe: a beast, that hath all
things belonging to the life of a beast, hath an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> fit for it, and so hath every creature els,
when <hi>God</hi> will make it happie; but the <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie</hi>
that is in <hi>God,</hi> is different from it in this, that
he hath a simple <hi>All-sufficiencie.</hi> That is. Take all
things that you can possiblie take, take them all
without comparison, take them without all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and so he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> that is one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>The second difference is this; that the creature,
though it haue an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> within its owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
compasse, yet that which it hath it cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to another. The Angels that are blessed
themselues, they cannot make others so. A man
that hath excellent gifts and graces himselfe, he
cannot convey them to another, but that is the
propertie of <hi>God,</hi> that is peculiar to him alone,
that he can make another <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> he can
cause another to partake of that <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
that is in himselfe; this is the difference betweene
<hi>God</hi> and the creature. Now, to make it evident to
you that he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> you shall know it by
this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:2062:25"/>First,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> in that he is most simple, without all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as we say, that is, <hi>perfect:</hi> for <hi>perfection</hi> and
<hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> are all one. Perfection is that,
whereby a thing is made vp, so that there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting to it; first, therefore, he is <hi>perfect,</hi> in
that he is without all mixture; we say, that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
gold, that hath no mixture of drosse in it; that
is perfect wine, that hath no mixture of any thing
besides; and in that the <hi>Lord</hi> is simple and most
pure of essence, it must needs be that he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
that he is most <hi>perfect,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Iohn 1.
He is light, and there is no darknesse in him.</hi> That is.
There is no mixture of any thing in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly.<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> As he is without mixture, so he is
without composition; wheresoever there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
(as there is in every creature,) there is
some imperfection: for, wherethere is compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there are parts, and wheresoever there are
parts, there must needs be imperfection: for the
part wants something of the whole; but in the
<hi>Lord</hi> there are no parts, he is without compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore he must needs be most <hi>perfect,</hi>
and most absolute, and <hi>All-sufficient</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly.<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> As he is without composition, so he
is without number: for all number, and all multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
ariseth from imperfection: for if one
would serue the turne, what needed more? And,
therefore, he, being one, simplie one, must needs
be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> for there is no multiplying in
him, and, therefore, there is no signe of imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:2062:25"/>Fourthly.<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> As he is without number, so he is
without any passive power. If he had any passiue
power in him, (as every creature hath,) he were
capable of receiving something that he hath not,
but the <hi>Lord</hi> is not so much as capable of it; for,
if there be no receptiue power, no passiue power
in him, it is impossible that any more should be
put, or infused into him, or imprinted, or stamped
in him, then is in him alreadie. And, therefore,
he is all in act. There is nothing in possibilitie in
<hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly. He is <gap reason="foreign">

of himselfe, whatsoever the creature is, it is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
all the excellencie that it hath is borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and derived, and is a participated excellencie
and therefore there is imperfection: for alway
when one hath any thing from another, there is
an indigence, in the thing, of it selfe, there is a
want: if a man haue enough at home, he will not
goe out to borrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now, the <hi>Lord</hi> whatsoever he

all the creatures in the world are as <hi>pits,</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns.</hi>
That is. Such as haue it borrowed, he hath
it of himselfe, and therefore, he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
which no creature is.</p>
               <p>Lastly.<note place="margin">Reas. 6.</note> He is without all causes, and is himselfe

no happinesse, no gift, no comfort, no blessing

               <p>

<hi>I am the Buckler,</hi> I will defend thee from all evill,

that no creature can peirce though, he is such

a Buckler as covers vs all over, he is <hi>a wall of Brasse,</hi>

is said to be <hi>a wall of fire</hi> about his children. That

defend those that are within the compasse of it,
but it burnes those that come neare it Such a one
is <hi>God</hi> to his children; And that is one thing
wherein this <hi>all-sufficiency</hi> consists, that <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to them.</p>
               <p>The second is,<note place="margin">Filling them with all good.</note> in filling them with all comfort,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

evill, and a <hi>Sunne</hi> to fill them with all comfort.
<hi>I am</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the exceeding great reward.</hi> That is.
As if he should say, <hi>Abraham,</hi> whatsoever is in
me, all that I haue, all my attributes are thine,
forthy vse, my power, my wisedome, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
my goodnes, my riches, whatsoever is mine
in the whole world, I will giue it for thy portion,
I and all that I haue are thine. And might he not
well say, he was an <hi>exceeding great reward?</hi> Who
can vnder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tand the height, and breadth, and
length, and depth of this reward, <hi>I am thy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great reward?</hi> That is. Thou shalt haue all
kinde of comforts in me, and thou shalt haue them
in the highest and greatest measure. And in these
doth <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie</hi> consist, that <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
and deriues to vs from himselfe.</p>
               <p>Now to shew that he is so, you must vnderstand
not onely that the <hi>Lord</hi> is wholly <hi>All-sufficient</hi> to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2062:27"/>
his children on the one side. That is. He brings
all comforts with him, but this must also be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that in the creature, on the other side, there
is no sufficiency at all. It was the poynt I began to
touch vpon the last day; I will now open it vnto
you more fully.</p>
               <q>That in the creature there is no sufficiency at all,
and in the Lord there is All-sufficiencie.</q>
               <p>We will not dis-joyne them, but handle both
together; (for it would be in vaine for me to
proue the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient,)</hi> but the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
which prevailes with the hearts of men, is
this, that they thinke there is somthing to be had
in the creature of it selfe. And, therefore we will
spend those Arguments by which we will proue
this chiefly, and convince you of it, that there is
nothing in the creature, no stabilitie, no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,
it can doe you, of it selfe, neither good, nor
hurt, as we told you the last day. All the good
and hurt that the creature can be supposed to do,
it stands in one of these two things, Either, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vs happie, or miserable; Or else, secondly,
in affording vs subsidiarie helpes, such as we haue
neede of, vpon occasion. In neither of them the
creature of it selfe,<note place="margin">The creature can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, of it selfe, to make vs happie. Because</note> is able to doe any thing. You
must remember (that which we then delivered)
that the creature is not able to doe any thing in
the matter of our happinesse;</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First. Because it is inferior to vs,<note place="margin">It is inferiour to vs.</note> and that which
is inferior cannot adde to that which is aboue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:2062:27"/>Secondly. Because the creature is accursed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
there is a curse lyes vpon the creature,<note place="margin">It is accursed.</note> there is an
emptines, and a vanitie in it, and that which is
emptie in it selfe, can giue no fulnes to vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. The creature is <hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
therefore you haue that phrase so often repeated
in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is vnder the Sunne.</note> 
                  <hi>All things vnder the Sunne, are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and vexation of spirit.</hi> Now the happines
that we seeke for, is aboue the Sunne, which the
creature is not able to reach.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. The creature is corporall, the minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
is spirituall,<note place="margin">It is corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> it is a spirit, and therefore it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
no happines from it; therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note>
we are sayd to goe to <hi>the spirits of perfect men,</hi> as
if that were a sutabl converse for a spirit.</p>
               <p>Fiftly. It is temporary,<note place="margin">It is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie.</note> whereas the soule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
it is not able to run the course with it
to its journeyes end, but it leaues it in the middle
way, and therefore it is not able to make it happy.</p>
               <p>Besides. As I told you then, the creature is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
finite,<note place="margin">It is finite.</note> and therefore is not able to fill the soule;
<hi>God</hi> is infinite, and therefore is able to doe it.
That no creature can doe it, we see in continuall
experience. Take any comfort that you finde in
the creature, and, when you haue enioyed it, still
you want somewhat, and you would haue more:
But when you come vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> &amp; enjoy him,
when your hearts are filled, still there is somewhat
beyond in him, there is no stop, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
And, therefore, he onely can make the
soule happie. Now the ground of it, why he is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to doe it, is, because the soule is made for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2062:28"/>
him, the soule is fitted for him, and therefore
there is nothing els answerable, there is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the minde, that it will not be filled
with any thing besides. The <hi>Lord</hi> might haue put
the minde into such a frame, he might haue so
constituted the soule of man, that the creature
might haue filled it, and satisfied it, and haue bin
an adaequate obiect to it, but he hath not done so:
for he made it for himselfe, and therefore, it is
not filled but with himselfe. So much for that,
that the creature in the matter of happines is able
to doe nothing.</p>
               <p>But you will say to me,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> This is a thing of which
we make no doubt; But what doe you say for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
vses, and for the vicissitudes of this life,
is not the creature, in these, able to doe good and
hurt?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ans.</note> as I sayd to you the last day, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not able, considered without the influence
of the first moover,<note place="margin">In doing vs good, or hurt.</note> to doe you the least good, or
hurt; as the words are <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 5.<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 5.</note> speaking of <hi>Idols,
they can doe neither good, nor hurt, and therefore feare
them not.</hi> As if he should say. If they could doe
you, either good, or hurt, you might feare them,
and it is certaine, if any creature were able, in
manner aforesaid, to doe you any good, or hurt,
you might feare the creature: for, <hi>God</hi> alters no
Law of nature, that which is in it selfe to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we may feare, that which is to be observed
and regarded, we may regard it. Now, if any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were able to doe good, or hurt, certainely
it were to be feared in regard of the hurt it could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2062:28"/>
doe, and to be regarded and observed in regard
of the good it could doe. Then, againe, the Law
of the <hi>Lord</hi> should be vnequall, if the <hi>Lord</hi> should
require all worship, that the intent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mind
be wholly taken vp about him, and that we should
haue no eye to the creature, if the creature had
any selfe-part with him in doing vs good or hurt;
for, if the creature could doe vs hurt, we should
not onely looke to <hi>God,</hi> that he should be a <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
but we should haue an eye vpon the creature.
If a man should say, I will be a defence to you,
I will keepe you safe; but I cannot doe it wholly,
such a one stands by, that may reach you a blow,
from which I cannot defend you; In nature and
reason, a man will haue an eye to that man, and
so we would to the creature, if it were able to hurt
vs: And so, likewise, for good, the <hi>Lord</hi> restraines
not that, nor sayth, you shall haue a partiall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
you shall haue no more then is in me,
though there might be something besides in the
creature; but he suffers our soules to be at full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
to seeke their happines to the vtmost, and,
therefore, if the creature did adde the least drop
of happines, or if the least beame of happines did
spring from the creature, certainely, you might
haue an eye vpon it, you might so farre worship
it, and regard it; but it is wholly from the <hi>Lord:</hi>
therefore, sayth he, let your hearts be onely fixed
vpon me, let your eye be onely towards me, let
your affections be taken vp about nothing but
me, you shall spend all the strenght of your soules
in obeying me, and keeping my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2062:29"/>
for, there is none in the world that is able
to doe you good, or hurt, but my selfe. Now, to
make this good to you, I will propound but these
two things. First. That all the creatures are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
at his disposing. Secondly. That when
he hath disposed of them, when he hath distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to vs to afford vs comfort, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
actually comfort vs, without a speciall hand
of his. Those two, being fully opened, will make
this poynt good to you, that the creature thus is
able to doe you neither good nor hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, I say, the creature is fully at his disposing,
that is,<note place="margin">Because the creature is fully at Gods disposing.</note> all the creatures in this world (let a man
cast his eye vpon the whole vniverse) they are all
but as so many servants, which are in the <hi>Lords</hi>
house, prepared to waite vpon his children, to
convey such comforts to them, as he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, so that there is not one creature in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or earth, stirres it selfe to doe you the least
good, but when the <hi>Lord</hi> commands it, and sayth,
Goe, comfort such a man, goe, refresh him, doe
him good; it stirres not without a warrant, and
without a speciall command from him. The bread
and meate, which you eate, nourish you not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he say, goe, and nourish such a man; the fire
warmes you not; and so of all the creatures else.
Againe,<note place="margin">Instance.</note> when he doth command them, they doe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it, and they doe it fully.</p>
               <p>So all the goodnesse that we participate of,<note place="margin">In Man.</note>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> both by good and evill men, all is from the <hi>Lord;</hi>
either it is from his mercy,<note place="margin">Others.</note> or from his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
therefore we should learne to sanctifie the

                  <hi>Lord,</hi> both in our hearts, and in our speeches, not
by saying I haue gotten me favour and friendship
of such a man, but, the Scriptures expression is,
<hi>the Lord hath given me favour</hi> in such a mans eyes.
So, againe, not by saying I haue procured the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of such a man against me, but say, the <hi>Lord</hi>
stirred vp such a mans spirit against me, and so
not by saying, I haue gotten such and such things,
but, as <hi>Iacob, the Lord of his goodnes hath given me
all this,</hi> not <hi>Laban,</hi> not my owne labour; if, in any
enterprise you haue successe, say not, I haue done
it, but say, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant sayd, <hi>the Lord hath
prospered my Iourney.</hi> That is. The <hi>Lord</hi> doth all in
all, it is he that commands all, it is he that dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
all; I say, that we should sanctifie the <hi>Lord</hi> in
our speeches; this is the language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
But, chiefly we should <hi>sanctifie him in our
hearts.</hi> That is. Thus we should conceiue of him,
and thus we should thinke of every creature.
<hi>Beloved,</hi> it will not be vnprofitable, if we draw this
a little neerer into particulars. That all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are so at his disposing, that they stirre not a
iot, but at his command, you shall see in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 14.</note>
the generall there set downe; <hi>I know that what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God shall doe, it shall be for euer, to it can no man
adde, nor from it can no man diminish, for Cod hath
done it, that men should feare before him.</hi> (Make)
<hi>I know that what soever God shall doe, it shall be for
ever.</hi> That is. The creature cannot alter any course
that <hi>God</hi> hath set, neither at this time, nor at any
other time, but it shall run in a constant course,
like a strong streame that cannot be resisted, it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2062:30"/>
shall be for ever, <hi>to it shall no man adde, and from it
can no man diminish.</hi> That is. The creature cannot
onely doe no substantiall action, but, when the
<hi>Lord</hi> hath done any thing, the creature cannot
adde the least thing to it, and as it cannot adde,
so it cannot diminish, nor take away the least
thing from any blessing that he bestoweth, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evill that he will doe, the creature addes not a
iot to that evill, to that crosse, to that affliction,
nor the creature mitigates not the crosse in the
least degree, though you thinke it doth: But that
we shall answer afterward. But why is this? <hi>This</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>the Lord hath done, that men should feare
before him.</hi> As if he should say; they would not
feare me, but they would feare the creature, and
looke to the creature, if it were able to adde any
thing, or to detract any thing, either to or from
any blessing, or comfort, that we haue, or to or
from any evill, or any crosse that lyes vpon vs.
Now, that it is so, that the creature is thus guided
and disposed by him, that it is able to doe nothing
without him, we will not instance in the vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creatures, which you all beleeue well enough
to be at his command, but we will instance in
those that seeme to be at the greatest libertie: that
is, the wills and vnderstandings of men; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if there be any liberty in the creature it is there,
the will of man is so free a thing, the devises of a
mans heart, his turning of himselfe this way or
that way, who can set any Rules to it? But in this
the <hi>Lord</hi> guides all: take it in other mens hearts.
<hi>Pro.</hi> 29.<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Every man seekes the face of the Ruler, but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2062:30"/>
his Iudgement is from the Lord.</hi> That is. Men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in this, if they thinke the Ruler, as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
can doe any thing, though he seeme to haue
much power, and abilitie, to doe some good, and
hurt to men, if any else can; therefore, sayth he,
<hi>men seeke his face,</hi> but, sayth he, you are deceived:
he is not able to doe any thing, but what the <hi>Lord</hi>
dictates to him, or permits him, what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
to him to doe, what he sayth he shall doe,
iust so farre he goes and no farther; for, the whole
judgement that a man hath, it is from him, it is
from the <hi>Lord.</hi> That is. All the good and evill that
he doth, that minde of his, from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,
is guided and fashioned by the <hi>Lord,</hi>
vpon every particular occasion, whensoever he
hath to doe with vs, or we with him: but that is
for men that are without vs, for other men.</p>
               <p>But, now, for a mans selfe: there is the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
reason,<note place="margin">Our selues.</note> indeed, of the one as there is of the other,
but man thinkes he hath libertie, he thinkes he can
goe to such a place, or not goe; he can doe such a
thing, or not doe it; <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is very true, and
therefore the <hi>All-mightie</hi> power of <hi>God</hi> is seene
herein, which we are not able to comprehend,
that when there is such a libertie in the soule, in
the will of man, in the devices and thoughts of a
mans heart, yet that they should be all so guided
by him, that there is not the least stirring of them
this way or that way, without his ordering and
concurrence; even, as you see, Birds flying, they
seeme to flie at libertie, yet that all should be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ordered by an over-ruling hand; Such
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2062:31"/>
are the wils of men; and that you shall see in these
particulars; when a man thinkes with himselfe,
he consults with himselfe about a thing that lyes
before him, that is his owne power to doe, or
not to doe, in this, sayth the Text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 21.<note place="margin">Prou. 19. 21.</note>
                  <hi>Many devices are in a mans heart, but the counsells of
the Lord shall stand.</hi> That is. Though there be such
varietie of devices, that he is able to cast things
this way, or that way, and to reason to and fro,
and to thinke with himselfe, I can doe this, and I
can doe the contrary, yet, sayth he, looke what
the <hi>Lord,</hi> by his counsell, will haue that man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
vpon, looke what issue he hath put to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations,
that counsell shall stand, and all those
devices shall be guided and ruled by it, and not
goe one step out of it. Come now to the counsells
of a mans heart, when a man hath thought this
with himselfe, I will speake or vtter this, or act
that, as he hath resolved to doe, you would thinke
this man hath power to doe it; but in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 1.</note> a
place that you know, <hi>There are preparations in a
mans heart, but the answer of the mouth is from the
Lord.</hi> That is. Even when it is so neere, that, you
thinke, there is nothing that can come betweene
that a man hath resolved with himselfe, and sayth
this will I doe, or this will I speake, sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi>
notwithstanding, this preparation, though you
haue made all these readie, that now it is vpon the
very poynt, on the act of execution, yet now, saith
he, the answer shall be given, as I thinke meete:
and, that which is sayd of answering, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to all kindes of actions, when a man hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2062:31"/>
thought with himselfe, and hath made his heart
ready, that all the wheeles of his soule are guided,
and turned, and compassed to effect such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
yet the <hi>Lord</hi> comes betweene the cup and the
lip, betweene the preparation and the execution,
and he doth but that which the <hi>Lord</hi> would haue
done. My <hi>Beloved,</hi> thus it is in others, and this
vse you may make of it, by the way; take a man
that is full of good thoughts towards you, the
<hi>Lord</hi> can turne it in an instant; take a man that is
full of evill devices towards you, if the <hi>Lords</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
be otherwise, that shall stand; Put the case that
the <hi>Lord</hi> suffer him to goe so farre as to resolue to
say, I will doe some hurt, or I will doe some good
to such a man, yet this preparation of the heart
shall not stand, vnlesse it be the same that the <hi>Lord</hi>
hath appointed; that shall be spoken, and that shall
be acted; and therefore, you shall see what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is gathered vpon it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 24.<note place="margin">Pro. 20. 24.</note> sayth the
wise-man there; <hi>The steps of a man are ruled by the
Lord, how can then a man vnderstand his owne way.</hi>
That is. A man, in the morning, when he riseth,
and thinkes with himselfe, this and this will I doe,
sayth he, deceiue not thy selfe, thy steppes are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the <hi>Lord,</hi> thou takest not a steppe into any
action, thou takest not a steppe into any good or
evill to thy selfe, thou takest not a steppe into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
or adversitie, but it is ruled, and over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the <hi>Lord,</hi> so that a man cannot vnderstand
his owne way. That is. He cannot say this, and
this will I doe, but like that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23.<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Him hast
thou not feared, in whose hands is thy life, and all thy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2062:32"/>
wayes.</hi> That is. Every thing that thou doest, every
steppe that thou takest, every thing that befalls
thee. So, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> this shall be enough to shew
you, that man in his actions is at the disposing of
the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for other creatures, if you will haue a proofe
for it, to make it evident to you, that no creature
stirres without him, consider that in <hi>Esa.</hi> 40. spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
there of the <hi>armies of the Lord;</hi> they are called
<hi>the armies of the Lord,</hi> because every creature is like
a Souldier that stands vnder his Generall, readie
to goe, readie to doe, and to execnte whatsoever
he commands. In the 26.<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 26.</note> Verse, <hi>Lift vp thine eyes
on high, and behold who hath created these things;
he brings out their Armies by number, and cals them
all by their names, by the greatnesse of his power, and
his mightie strenght nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ayles.</hi> This is the thing
I would haue observed out of this place, that they
are all <hi>Gods</hi> armies. Now an army consists of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particulars; take all the creatures vnder the
cope of heaven, they are not single, you know,
but there are multitudes of them, thore are many
Dealls, many Fowles, many Fishes; sayth the <hi>Lord</hi>
hore, I call them every one by their name. That is.
He knowes every one of them, notwithstanding
that infinite number of them, he knowes them
every one: even as a Maister knows every servant
in his house, and can call them by their names;
So, sayth he, every particular creature he knowes
by name. It is a comfortable consideration, when
you consider that there is not one of these, but the
<hi>Lord</hi> knowes them by name, and they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2062:32"/>
to doe either good or hurt, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him; the sleepe that you take, the meate that
you eate, the comforts that you haue, whatsoever
is done by any creature, all comforts come from
him: But this is enough for that. But, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there seemes to be the greatest liberty, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
varietie, the greatest changablenes, the minds
of men, we see also is disposed by him. That is the
first thing we are to shew, to make this good,
that the creature can neither doe good nor evill;
because though it doe both (for that there is such
a thing experience shewes, that the creature doth
good and hurt, and every creature sometimes
comforts, and sometimes hurts and grieues, but
that is at <hi>Gods</hi> disposing) and since it is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and is in the hands of the <hi>Lord,</hi> as an Axe,
or a Sword, or a Staffe, and is not vsed, except it
be at his disposing; it appeares, that it is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and absolutely subiect to the dominion of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, now, for the second, which is more than
this, when the <hi>Lord,</hi> I say, hath sent such a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to thee, aud thou hast it before thee (that is
the second thing) that it is not able to comfort,
nor hurt thee, without him. Put the case, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be pregnant, full of comfort, yet it is not able
to giue downe that milke of comfort that is in it,
except the <hi>Lord</hi> educe and bring it forth, except
the <hi>Lord</hi> apply it in particular to thee. And the
same I may say of any hurtfull creature; be
it never so pregnant with evill, be it never so
full of it, yet, it is not able to exercise it, it is
not able to act that hurt it hath, except the <hi>Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:2062:33"/>
bring it forth, except the <hi>Lord</hi> set it a worke, and
vse it for such a purpose: as an Axe if it be never
so sharpe, yet, if the Carpenter doe not vse it to
cut such a Tree, to lop such a branch, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe it.</p>
               <p>Now the ground of it, why the creature is not
able to doe this, is from hence, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that ariseth from the creature, proceeds from
that sutablenesse and that agreeablenesse which is
betweene the mind and it. That is; when the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and the minde are fitted one to another, as
the sword to the sheath, or as the meare to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
then the creature comforts; but, if there be
an vnsutablenesse, a disagreement, a disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
betweene the creature and the minde, now
thou receivest no comfort from it: for what is it
to thee? for comfort lyes not simply in any thing;
but that is comfortable that agreeth with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
and the desire of a man. Whatsoever it is,
let the desire be what it will, if that which thou
hast, sute with that desire, it is comfortable; when
a mans heart is sad, such actions as are sutable to
the disposition, are pleasant; weeping is pleasant,
and complaints are plealant; musique grieues,
because that is not sutable to the present dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And so in every thing else. It is no matter
what thy condition is, but what sutablenesse and
agreeablenesse is betweene thy minde and thy
condition; if thou be in never so good condition,
yet, except <hi>God</hi> make that and thy mind to agree,
thou shalt receiue no comfort from it; if a man
be in meane condition, if he be in prison, if he be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2062:33"/>
in the lowest estate, if he be in bondage, if he be in
exile, wheresoever he is, if the <hi>Lord</hi> make but that
condition and his minde to agree, it will sute well
enough. And therefore, hence comes the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that is in the creatures, when a man hath
them, and enioyes them, it may be, those things
which thou hast, are such as sute not with thee,
somewhat there is that thou affectest, something
that thou desirest, that thou hast not, and that thou
canst not get. As, for instance, <hi>Haman</hi> had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
full of comfort, and of all kinde of blessings,
yet there was not a sutablenes betweene his mind
and that estate, one thing came betweene, <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi>
sate in the <hi>Gate,</hi> and, therefore, this avay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him nothing.<note place="margin">Hester. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Hest.</hi> 5. That is; Though there
were all this together, yet since there was not a
coniunction of the facultie and of the obiect, this
avayled him nothing. Why? because it was not
sutable to his desire, there was something that he
would haue, that his affections and appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ite were
set on, that if he had he should be well. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
sayth he, all this avayles me nothing; that is
his expression. So <hi>Amnon,</hi> he was the Kings son,
and had all things that a Kings sonne might haue,
yet all this was nothing, there was something els,
that his heart was set on, that he had not. Many
the like instances I might giue, but I neede not.
Therefore, I say, when the <hi>Lord</hi> puts an vnsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
betweene thy minde and the comforts
that thou hast, and suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers thee to haue an in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
appotite; as women that haue good meate to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate, yet sometime doe long after ashes &amp; coales,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2062:34"/>
and such things; so when <hi>God</hi> giues a man an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
when he compasseth him about with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and blessings on all sides, yet if he suffer such
an inordinate appetite to take hold of him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
some odde thing, some by-thing that posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his soule, he may haue the blessing, and haue
it present with him, and yet receiue no comfort
from it at all. Now, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> all this tends to
this purpose, that you may know, that it is the
<hi>Lord</hi> that giues all good and evill, both in that the
creature is at his disposing that doth it, and, not
so onely, but, the efficacie of the creature (to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
such an act of good or evill to vs, that we
should receiue actuall comfort of discomfort
from it) it is from him, and all, I say, chiefly ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from that dominion that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath over
the spirits of men, it doth not lye so much in the
creature, as in framing the apprehension of the
minde, and therein is seene the truth of this poynt
chiefly that we haue now delivered, that the <hi>Lord</hi>
onely is the Author of good and hurt, and not the
creature; because he guides the apprehension;
for,<note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the mind, maketh happines mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</note> if it be true, as it is most true, <hi>Animus cuius<expan>

&amp;c.</hi> it is the mind and apprehension of every man
that maketh his life pleasant, or it is the minde of
man that maketh him happie, and not the thing,
then the <hi>Lord</hi> that guides the minde, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
the heart, he hath the onely hand in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the life pleasant. When thou hast gotten all
thou wouldst haue, yet what is that, except thy
heart be fashioned to it? This you shall see in <hi>Psal.</hi>
33.<note place="margin">Ps. 33. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord looked downe from his dwelling, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2062:34"/>
from his habitation, vpon the men that dwell vpon
the earth, and fashions their hearts every one of them.</hi>
(Make) <hi>he fashions their hearts.</hi> That is; A man
hath such a frame of heart, such an apprehension
of things, as it pleaseth <hi>God</hi> to giue him; So that,
take any estate or condition that a man is in (as
you know there is a great varietie of conditions,
to be rich, and to be poore, to be in prison, and to
be at libertie, to be in health, and to be sicke, to be
in honour, and to be in disgrace) these are, as it
were, the severall moulds, into which the <hi>Lord</hi>
casts men. Now, if he will frame the spirit to that
mould, like soft clay to the seale (for that is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in <hi>Iob</hi>) I say, if he fashion the spirit to it,
&amp; make it pliable to the condition, to that mould,
a man will beare and indure it well enough, he
shall finde comfort in it, it is nothing to him. And
therefore, the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi>
when <hi>God</hi> was with them to fashion their hearts
to passe through the varietie of troubles, might
say of themselues, <hi>Non patimur &amp;c.</hi> They seemed
to suffer, but in truth did not suffer. What was it to
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he indured that state and condition
that he did, when his heart was so fashioned to it
as it was? Now, I say, in that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath this
dominion over the spirits of men, hence it is that
he makes a mans life comfortable. Put the case,
thy hand hath gotten much, that thou hast gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much wealth together, yet, you know, <hi>Eccles.</hi>
2. 24.<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no profit to a man, but that he eate and

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:2062:35"/>
That is. All this is nothing, except a man delight
in it,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> except a man enioy the comfort of it. Well,
but is not that an easie thing, when the mind and
the state are put together? No;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> (sayth the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
<hi>this is of the hand of the Lord.</hi> That is. Except
the <hi>Lord</hi> doe it by a speciall hand vpon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is not able to doe it, except he fit the mind
to the state, except he sute them together, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe it: so I may say of all things else. A hony-Combe
may be very bitter to a man, his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
may be so disposed, as in a Feaver, you
know, that which is sweete is bitter; againe, that
which is bitter may be sweete to a man; so those
that are the greatest comforts may be bitter, and
those things that may be bitter to other men, may
be sweet to him. It is sayd of evill men, <hi>they feare
where no feare is.</hi> That is. When there is no cause
of feare, yet the <hi>Lord</hi> can so fashion their hearts;
and so frame their apprehension, that they shall

in the creature; if the <hi>Lord</hi> be thus <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
my <hi>Beloved,</hi> then let your hearts be satisfied with
him alone, let them be filled with him, let them
be so bottomed vpon him, and so strengthned by

out to others, if you haue enough in him; it will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2062:36"/>
strengthen you against that expence of spirit, and
of your thoughts, which you bestow vpon vaine
things; for, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> we haue but a short time

the most precious thing we haue, the thoughts

this water runne besides the Mill. That is. That it
be not bestowed vpon things that are vnworthy
of it. If the <hi>Lord</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> why should you
not bestow it altogether vpon him? Why should
you spend it vpon the creature? Why should your
minde be occupied about it? Why should you
be so intent vpon them? Why should you be so
subiect to carnall griefes, and feares, and carnall
desires? Surely, all these should be taken vp about
the <hi>Lord:</hi> for he lookes for it at our hands, <hi>I am
All-sufficient:</hi> therefore let all these be bestowed
vpon me. And againe, as we should learne to see
this fulnes in <hi>God,</hi> to haue our hearts bottomed
and fixed vpon him, so we should labour to see
the emptines of the creature.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> But, you will say,
who doth not know that the creature is emptie?
It is no new thing,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> my <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is certaine we
doe not fully know it, if we did, what meane those
complaints, and those griefes, that we take vp vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
euery evill accident that falls out? for nothing
is said to be emptie, but when you looke for a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

you looke for water there; you doe not say
a Rocke is emptie, for you doe not expret it there:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2062:36"/>
So we may say of the creature, if we thought, and
did beleeue, that there were an emptines in it,
we would never expect so much from it as we do.
But, when we complaine and say, I thought to
haue found such and such things, and I find them
not, it is a signe that we looke for a fulnes there;
and, therefore, let vs labour to correct that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
it will helpe vs against those griefes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
to which we are so much subiect; let vs
looke for no more in the creature then is in it.
All griefe and stirring of affection, ariseth from
this expectation, this over-weening, this high
prizing of the creature: if you finde inconstancie
in men; why doe you looke for constancie in
them? they are creatures; if you looke for stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in your estate, and wonder why a change
should come (I was heretofore rich, and now I
am poore, I was honourable, and now I am in
disgrace) why didst thou expect stabilitie in that
which is subiect to vanitie? Things would not
trouble vs, if we did not expect too much from
them, if we knew there were an emptines in them;
he that lookes not for much from the creature,
can never be much deceived: he that lookes for
much from <hi>God,</hi> shall be sure to haue his desire
answored and satisfied; he shall never fall short of
his expectation. And therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> labour
to alter your conceits that way, that whensoever
any thing falle out, you may not be troubled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>it,
you may not feare for that a coident, for it ariseth
hence, because you looked for more in it, than

Philosophie, that after a man is put into expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

more vehemently, whereas had he not had that
expectation, he would haue beene more quiet.
Therefore, if we were perswaded, and convinced
of the vanitie of the creature, and the emptines in
it, we would never expect much from it; and, if
we did expect nothing, our hearts would be quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

When the <hi>Lord</hi> giues such a precept as this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
there is a ground for it (as that we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
told you, that) in all the Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ments of
<hi>God,</hi> if they were open to vs, if we did see the

much reason for them, that if <hi>God</hi> did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them, you would see it best for you to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
them, you would see reason for it. Now, when
the <hi>Lora</hi> bids them that grieue, to do it as though
they grieved not, and them that reioyce, to doe it
as though they reioyced not, I gather this from it,
that the creature can doe very little good or hurt;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2062:37"/>
for, if the creature could doe much hurt, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then we might grieue to some purpose; but,
sayth he, let the evill be what it will, yet grieue as
though you grieved not. That is; Let it be as good
as nothing, that, as a man is said to heare as
though he heard not, and to see as if he saw not,
when he doth not intend the tale that is told, but
yet he heares it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so, sayth he, if you haue some
griefe, let it be so small, so little, as if you grieved
not; And so likewise for Ioy; Put the case, you
had all the preferments, all the comforts and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
in this world heaped vpon you, yet reioyce
in these so rmisly, as if you reioyced not. Now,
it is certaine, if they could doe vs any speciall
good, we might reioyce in a greater measure then
so: but, when the <hi>Lord</hi> sayth, <hi>reioyce as if you reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
not,</hi> it is certaine, they can doe vs very little
good. That is; So little as if they did vs no good
at all.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> you will say, it seemes it is a little good that
they can doe vs, whereas it was sayd before, the
creature can doe neither good nor hurt.</p>
               <p>We will answer that briefly;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> The meaning is
this, that the <hi>Lord</hi> giues vs leaue to grieue a little,
and to reioyce a little, so that it be in a remis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

manner, so that it be kept within bounds, but the
creature can doe vs no good, nor no hurt at all of
it selfe, but as it is disposed by the <hi>Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though it doe something, yet that is done by
<hi>God,</hi> and not meerely by the creature. So the rule
holds good, though the creature doe something,
yet seeing it is not of it selfe, but as it is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2062:38"/>
you may truely say, it is not the creature
that hath done any thing, but the <hi>Lord</hi> hath done

               <p>But,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> why then is it said, it is a little? for this
takes all away.</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> the meaning is this, it can doe a little.
That is; All the evill any creature can doe, it is
but a little in regard of the eternall that <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
on the soule, it is as good as nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of those eternall good things. As if he
should say; The things that belong to <hi>God</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
the things that belong to the Kingdome
of <hi>God,</hi> and to a mans salvation, the things that
are spirituall and eternall, these are good indeede,
and evills indeed, if any of these befall you, you
must grieue exceedingly: for you haue great cause:
for that can doe you great hurt, and so grace can
doe you much good, for it tends to eternitie, it
tends to set things even, or odde betweene al-mightie
<hi>God</hi> and you; and, therefore, in these
things, let your reioyching be very great, and
your griefe very great. But for any thing
that belongs to this present life, it
is exceeding small, it is as
good as nothing.</p>

be to you in stead of all things; and therefore let
men consider that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Whosoever comes
to God, must beleeue that God is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them that serue him.</hi> That is; a man will
never change, except it be for the better, except a
man thinke his condition will be better with the
<hi>Lord,</hi> than it was out of him, he will never come
in, but, when he is once perswaded of that, he
cannot keepe out; you know, that argument is
vsed by the <hi>Prodigall sonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 25.</note> sayth he, <hi>if I stay here,
I shall perish, if I goe to my fathers house his servants
haue bread enough;</hi> that double argument brought
him home. So when a man considers, out of <hi>God</hi>
there is no sufficiency at all, there is not any thing
in the creature, as we shewed to you before at
large: then if you come home to the <hi>Lord,</hi> there
is <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> in him. That is; All your desires
shall be satisfied, there is nothing that you neede,
nothing that you want, but it shall be supplyed.
This, I say, is that that brings a man in to consider
of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie;</hi> but this we doe not meane
to inlarge now, but rather proceede to the other.</p>
               <p>Whether a man be come in or not, there will
not be much difference in the application of this
that we are now to deliver, to be content to haue
<hi>God</hi> alone to be our portion; for that is the cause
of all our vnevennesse, and of our imperfect wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with <hi>God,</hi> we would haue somewhat besides.
And therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> taketh this course with
his Disciples, he tells them the worst first; he tells
them they must part with all, that they must deny
themselues throughly &amp; perfectly, and they must
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2062:39"/>
be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with him alone; because the <hi>Lord</hi> knew,
otherwise, they would never haue constantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, and though they might haue gone
farre with him, yet, when they had met with a rub,
when that, which they would not part with, and
the service of <hi>God</hi> should come in competition,
surely, they would turne aside, and leaue him.
Now, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> you must consider this, and
worke your hearts vnto it, that, if you haue him
alone, it is enough; for if men were perswaded,
that he is enough, they would be content with
him alone. When the Sunne shines to you, though
there be never a Starre, is it not day? Doe you
not call it so? Againe, when all the Starres shine,
and the Sunne is set, is not that night? Is it not so
when you haue the <hi>Lord</hi> alone? Suppose you haue
nothing but him for your portion, shall not the
<hi>Lord</hi> be sufficient to make you happie? Is he not
<hi>a Sunne and a Shield,</hi> sayth the <hi>Psalmist?</hi> Is he not
a Sunne. That is; <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> to fill you with
comfort of all kindes? What then though you haue
nothing but him alone? Againe, put case you had
all those creatures, all those Starres to shine to
you (for they haue an excellency in them, they
haue a light, and a comfort, though it be a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
and a derived light, as we heard, such as
they receiue from the Sunne) suppose you haue
them, it is but night notwithstanding, you are
but in a state of misery. And therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi>
why should you not be content to haue the <hi>Lord</hi>
alone for your portion? Take all the creatures,
and you finde, by experience, that when they are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2062:40"/>
inioyed, you see an end of their perfection, you
quickly finde a bottom in them; the heart hasteth
after somewhat else, you quickly sucke out the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oney that is in every one of those flowers, and,
when you haue done so, you goe to another flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and to another, and no where doth the soule
finde rest. <hi>God</hi> did purposely set forth <hi>Salomon,</hi>
and gaue him all things that his heart could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
so that no man had the like before him, nor
any man since. And for what end doe you thinke
did the <hi>Lord</hi> it? Surely, for this purpose, that he
might be a perpetuall example (as things were
written for our learning, so all these things that
were done in those former times, which are the
Rule of these latter, they were done for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
he had all varietie of blessings, more then

                  </gap> he looked
not for, many stings, many troubles. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why should you not be content with <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone?
Take all outward things; before you inioy
them, they seeme to be great; when you haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
them, and tryed them, you quickly finde a
bottom in them; for there is but a false lustre that
Sathan and your owne lusts put vpon them; they
haue gilded outsides, but when they come to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
the guilt weares off, and you finde after a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2062:40"/>
while, what they are. But come to spirituall
things; the more you weare them, the more you
finde the beautie and excellencie that is in them;
for there is a dust and a rust that is cast vpon them,
which likewise, the wearing takes off. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why should you not be content to take <hi>God</hi>
alone? What is it that man so seekes after? is it
not happines, and comfort? Alas; suppose that
you had all these in the highest degree that you
can looke for, when all is done, you shall finde
that but labour lost, you shall finde no stabilitie in
them. You know what <hi>Davsd</hi> sayth in <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 7.</note>
when he thought his mountaine was made strong
and vnderpropped well on each side; What cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
now an alteration? He doth not say, there was
a change in the thing, he doth not say, his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
was pulled downe, or that there was an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in his estate, that this or that accident fell
out, that the people rebelled against him now
which did not before, or, that he had lost such
and such friends that he had before. But, sayth
he, <hi>thou turnedst away thy face, and then I was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
The meaning is this, that, if there was a
change in his estate, the change in <hi>God</hi> was the
cause, so then it was the <hi>Lord</hi> that comforted him,
though he saw it not, it was not the mountaine
that held him vp, it was not all those blessings that
he enioyed in it that refreshed his heart, but it
was the light that shined through them; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he found, when this light was with drawne,
though he inioyed them still, his comfort was
gone. So, I say, if it were from the things, they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2062:41"/>
might continue your comforts to you, but when
there is a change in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then comes the change
vpon earth. And on the other side; if <hi>God</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
constant, if he remaine safe, you neede feare
nothing, the creature followes him, it is he that
shines through them. What if a man had the avre
and no light in it? So, what if we had never so
much, and no beames flowing form him though
them, who onely is the <hi>God of all comfort,</hi> and the
Father of all consolation?</p>
               <p>But, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> to be briefe; Put the case a
man were stript of all things, and suppose he were
exiled out of his owne Country, suppose he were
reduced to extreame povertie, or shut vp close
Prisoner, suppose all imployments were taken
from him, and he were laid aside like a broken
vessell; now for a man to say, yet <hi>God</hi> is enough,
and that he is content with him alone for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is the tryall, and this we ought to doe:
and there is great reason why we should doe it;
you shall see it was practised by the Saints. When
<hi>Abraham</hi> was an exile from his Countrey, and
had not a foote of land, was not the <hi>Lord All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
to him? did he not provide for him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly?
When <hi>Eliah</hi> fled, and had no meate, he
had neither money, nor any body to provide any
thing for him, did not the <hi>Lord</hi> provide for him?
he set the creature a-worke to doe that, to feede
him in an extraordinary way, when the ordinary
fayled. When <hi>Paul</hi> was shut vp in Prison, yet the

yet they sang with joy of heart, there was such a

they could not containe. If a man be brought to

it not enough for <hi>Iob</hi> to haue <hi>God</hi> for his portion?

               <p>Oh;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> but you will say, if I were a spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
onely of an immateriall soule, &amp; no more,
I should be content, (it may be) to haue the <hi>Lord</hi>
for my portion, but, besides that, I haue a body,
I haue a temporall life, and therefore I need tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

haue the <hi>Lord,</hi> I would haue these things added;
for, how should I be without them?</p>
               <p>To this I answer.<note place="margin">Ans.</note> First; that, though thou be
deprived of all these temporall blessings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
yet thou shalt finde them all in the <hi>Lord,</hi>
I say, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

though thou wert stript of them all, yet thou shalt
finde them all in the <hi>Lord,</hi> if thou haue him alone.
You will say,<note place="margin">2. Ob. Answ.</note> how can that be? This you must
know, that all that <hi>God</hi> hath wrought in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
all the excellencie, all the beautie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and comfort, he hath put into the creature,
into meate, drinke, musicke, flowers, yea, into
all creatures of all sorts; who is the cause of all this?
Is not the <hi>Lord</hi> the cause? It is certaine then, that
whatsoever is in the effect, is in the cause, and in
the cause in a more excellent manner. There are
some causes that produce but their like, as when
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2062:42"/>
fire begets fire, or, when a man begets a man,
here there is an equalitie betweene the cause and
the effect: but there are other causes that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
their effects; as the Sunne produceth many
effects, that haue a dissimilitude to it, it hardens,
and softens, and heates, and dryes, and all these
are in the Sunne, but they are in a more excellent
manner, then you shall see them in the effect: that
is but a poore similitude, to expresse that I would,
but yet it is the best we haue. Looke now vpon
whatsoever thou hast found in the creature, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
beautie thou hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> It is this to thy comfort; If thou loose

and mother, or brethren, or sisters, or lands, and

in him: for, if all these comforts be in him, if thou
hast him alone, thou shalt finde all these comforts
communicated to thee. That is; Thou shalt finde
the comfort of them in a greater measure, in a
more excellent manner, than thou shouldst in the
things themselues: why else should he say, <hi>You
shall haue an hundreth fold with persecution?</hi> And
marke the instance; for you shall finde the promise
repeated againe, and he names them every one;
<hi>I say to you, there is no man that forsakes father, or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2062:42"/>
mother, wife, and children, brother, or sister, or lands,
and houses, for my sake, and the Gospells, but he shall
receiue an hundreth fold in this world, and in the
world to come eternall life.</hi> That is, you shall finde
comfort in <hi>God</hi> alone; if thou be shut vp alone,
and yet conversest with <hi>God,</hi> and hast communion
with him, and seest no creature in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
him, thou shalt haue abundance of sweete
comfort: take all those varieties of comforts that
these giue; as, lands giue one kinde of comfort,
and Parents another, and wiues another; thou
shalt finde all these varieties of comforts in him,
he will fill thy soule with all these, for they are in
him alone. Marke that reason that the <hi>Lord</hi> vsed
to <hi>Moses,</hi> when he complained of his tongue, that
he was not able to speake; <hi>Send,</hi> sayth he, <hi>by whom
thou shouldest send;</hi> (sayth the <hi>Lord) who made the
tongue?</hi> who made the dumbe, and the deafe, and
the hearing,<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 11.</note> and the seeing? <hi>Is it not I the Lord?</hi>
As if he should say; <hi>Moses,</hi> sure I am the maker of
all these, though I haue not the things in me (the
<hi>Lord</hi> hath no tongue, he hath no eye) yet, sayth he,
thou shalt finde them all in me. That is; His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is this, <hi>I will be with thee;</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> might
haue made this obiection; Though thou be with
me, yet I shall want a tongue to speake, what will
that helpe? Sayth he, I, who made that, I haue a
power in me, and if I be with thee, it shall be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
I will finde out a way for thee, that shall be
as good as if thou hadst the most eloquent tongue
in the world. The same may I say of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
in the world; who made them? who made
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2062:43"/>
those fathers and mothers? who made those bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and sisters, that thou art deprived of in exile,
or vpon any such occasion, in povertie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?
Is it not he that made them? What if the
<hi>Lord</hi> will be with thee? What if he will goe with
thee into banishment, or into prison, as he did
with <hi>Ioseph?</hi> What if he will be with thee in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?
What if he will be with thee in povertie?
Is there not enough in him, who is full of all
comfort? He can fill thee with all varietie by that
immediate communicating of himselfe. <hi>Beloved,</hi>
what doe you thinke heaven is? When you are in
heaven, doe you thinke your estate shall be worse?
You see what varieties of comforts we now haue
here. When we come to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shall we haue lesse
varieties? No; we shall haue more; how shall we
haue it? for we shall haue none but <hi>God</hi> alone;
we shall haue fellowship onely with him. If there
were not that varietie in him that is in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
certainely, we should be loosers, the soule
should not be filled, nor satisfied: And therefore,
sayth the Text;<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>There shall neede no Sunne nor
Moone;</hi> all the creatures that now giue vs comfort
shall be taken away, why? <hi>for the Lord shall be Sun
and Moone,</hi> he shall be every thing, he shall be all
in all things. That is; Thou shalt finde them all
collected in him; and doe you thinke, that the
<hi>Lord</hi> shall be thus in heaven, and will he not be so
to his servants vpon earth? It is certaine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he pleaseth to communicate himselfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man, to reveale himselfe, and to take any man
into fellowship with himselfe, if he please to come
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2062:43"/>
to the soule of a man, to dwell with him, to suppe
with him, as he hath promised so to doe &amp; doth,
then when all other comforts fayle, at that time
<hi>God</hi> delighteth to come, then thou shalt finde va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of comfort enough. And therefore, why
shouldst thou not be contented to haue <hi>God</hi> alone
for thy portion? Thou shalt finde enough in him
as in an adaequate obiect. This is the first thing I
haue to shew you, that in your very communion
with him, you shall finde enough, when the <hi>Lord</hi>
hath done it, when thou art filled with the joy of
the holy Ghost, what will all be to thee? what doe
you thinke all the world was to them, if it should
haue beene presented to the Apostles, if one
should haue presented them with a Kingdome,
with all that ever the sonnes of men could devise?
Doe you thinke they would haue regarded them
much? Surely, they would not, as they did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
regard the contrary. Imprisonment was nothing,
&amp; death was nothing to them; you see with what
facilitie they passed through them. By the Rule of
Contraries, outward happinesse had beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
for he that grieues much for any outward
losse, he would much reioyce in the contrary
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ments: when the Apostles were thus filled
with the joy of the holy Ghost, in regard of the
one, certainely they would not haue regarded the
other, if it had beene represented vnto them;
what was now the joy in the holy Ghost? it was
but the <hi>Lord</hi> communicating himselfe: they had
but the <hi>Lord</hi> alone, they were but led into a neerer
fellowship with him: there was but a little cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2062:44"/>
opened, as it were, to see that excellency and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and it filled
them so, that they cared for nothing besides. But
this, I say, we would worke our hearts to, if we
did looke vpon <hi>God</hi> as an adaequate obiect.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> you will say, though this be something to
haue my soule filled with comfort thus; yet there
are many necessities, many vses, that I haue of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things.</p>
               <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> I will goe yet further. Doe thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the <hi>Lord,</hi> what he is; goe through all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
consider his almightie power, consider
his great wisedome, his counsell, and his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
consider his great goodnesse, and his
truth, and kindnesse, consider his patience, and
his long suffering, &amp;c. all these are thine. My <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
God</hi> is not knowne in the world, we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not aright what he sayth, when he sayth, <hi>I will
be thy portion, I will be thy God;</hi> for so he sayth, <hi>I
my selfe am my beloveds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and my welbeloved is mine.</hi>
Now to haue the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe, is more than if he
should giue thee all the Kingdomes of the earth;
consider this, the power of <hi>God</hi> is thine, to worke
all thy workes for thee, to make passage for thee,
when thou art in a straite, to bring thy enterprises
to passe, to deliver thee out when thou art in any
affliction, out of which the creature is not able to
deliver thee. Thinke what it is to haue an interest
in <hi>Gods</hi> almightie power, and thinke this is one
part of thy portion: the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe is thine,
and all his power is thine. Consider, likewise, his
wisedome, if thou neede counsell in any difficult
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2062:44"/>
case, if thou wouldst be instructed in things that
be obscure, if thou wouldst be led into the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that are revealed in the word, to see the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things contained in the Law; the wisedome
of <hi>God</hi> is thine, thou hast interest in it, it is thy
portion, thou shalt haue the vse of it as farre as he
sees it meete for thee. And so the Iustice of <hi>God</hi>
is thine, to deliver thee when thou art oppressed,
to defend thee in thine innocency, and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
thee from the iniuries of men. And so we may
goe through the rest. Now consider, what a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is to haue the <hi>Lord</hi> alone: if thou hadst no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> thou hadst enough. When a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
marries with a Tradsman, or with an Artist,
that is excellent but in some one Art, or with one
that is excellent in learning and knowledge, shee
is content, it may be, and thinkes it to be a great
portion, as good as if shee had many thousands
with him, for, sayth shee, this is as good, it will
bring it in. Thinke then, if thou hast the <hi>Lord</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
for thy portion, if thou hast nothing else,
thou hast sufficient. Thinke of all these attributes,
&amp; say within thine owne heart, all these are mine.
And therefore, why should I not be content to
haue him alone? But yet this is not enough, I will
goe yet further with thee, if thy heart be not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this, yet consider all things in the world
are thine: for whatsoever is the <hi>Lords,</hi> is thine.
When a virgin marries with a man that is rich,
shee lookes vpon all his possessions, and sees so
many thousand sheepe, so many fayre houses, and
so much land, he hath so much gold and silver;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2062:45"/>
and, she sayth thus with herselfe; now he is my
husband, all this is mine: I shall haue my interest
in them, I shall haue that that is fit for me. So,
looke now vpon the <hi>Lord,</hi> consider when thou
hast chosen him to be thy portion: though thou
shouldst be content to haue him alone, yet all this
comes together with him, it cannot be separated
from him, so that even then when thou art depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all, yet all is thine: he hath it readie for thee,
to bestow on thee, as there is occasion.</p>
               <p>You will say,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> these are notions, these are hard
things to beleeue, to see these really is another
thing.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ans.</note> will you beleeue your senses, I finde
that the Scriptures take away arguments from
those things, that are exposed to the view of men,
looke on nature and see what the <hi>Lord</hi> doth there,
doe but compare a house-keeper on earth with
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and see what the difference is betweene
them; Consider how many there are in this house
of the <hi>Lord,</hi> of which he is Maister, how many
there are at vprising and down-lying from day to

reasoning with the sonnes of men, even after this
manner; Why, sayth he, doe you doubt him?
why are you not content to consecrate your selues
to him, to be to him alone? Doe but see how he
deales with all creatures, in the morning they
know not what to doe, but <hi>they looke vp vnto him;</hi>
he instanceth in the <hi>Ravens,</hi> and other creatures,
<hi>he openeth his hand and giveth them foode,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 28. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>he shuts
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2062:45"/>
his hand and they perish.</hi> That is; He feeds them
all. Consider the Treasures in <hi>Iob</hi> 38.<note place="margin">Iob 38. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Doest thou</hi>
(sayth the <hi>Lord) know the treasures of snow and

Land over, thinke what a great treasure the <hi>Lord</hi>
hath, from whence it comes: in the mightie
hayles that be, sayth he to <hi>Iob,</hi> dost thou know the

                  <hi>and who
can shut them?</hi> That is; Consider well, looke on

                  <hi>when the earth is hot, and the clods knit

                  <hi>who

                  <hi>from his chambers he sendeth

Thus the <hi>Lord</hi> hath done. So againe, sayth
he, <hi>who is it that enlightens the earth? Whence comes
the light? and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Againe, who is it that maintaines all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
the <hi>Lyon</hi> when he runs out of his denne in

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2062:46"/>
prey: and not he onely, but all the creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
Consider how he provides for all: the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stridge
(Iob 39). God hath taken vnderstanding,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 39 17. 20.</note>
sayth he, <hi>from her, and she leaues her young ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
her,</hi> and provides not for them; how comes
it then that they grow vp, that the species is not
extinguished, but continues? Sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi>
I take care for them. And so the <hi>Hinde</hi> that is in
the Wildernes, as shee calues shee bruseth her
young, and casts them forth, and there she leaues
them, who should provide for them? Is it not I
sayth the <hi>Lord?</hi> And so along. But I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my selfe further in this; because I hast to
that which remaines. Onely this Vse is to be
made of it, that when you looke vpon the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse:
looke vpon all the parts of it; see the worke
of <hi>God</hi> in every kinde; and see how he provides
for the <hi>Ravens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 6. 26.</note> that haue neither <hi>barnes</hi> nor <hi>store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house;</hi>
see how he <hi>clothes the earth,</hi> that <hi>spinnes not,</hi>
that hath no garments made for it; see all that he
doth in the worke of nature, and by this you may
learne to know <hi>God:</hi> by this you may know, what
he is, how you may well be content to haue him
alone for your portion.</p>
               <p>But this will be obiected;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> I but we finde it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
those that are his children, are they not
poore? are they not forsaken many times?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> I answer in a word; It is true, while
the children are vnder age, they enioy nothing in
comparison of that inheritance, that is provided
for them. The servant many times liues in a farre
better condition, and escapes that correction, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2062:46"/>
that discipline and nurture, which the childe is
subiect to; and he hath money in his purse many
times, when the Sonne hath none: he hath many
liberties, which the childe is deprived of. The
reason is, because it is the time of his nurture;
And so sayth the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Israell,</hi> I could haue
brought you into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> at the first:
it was no difficult thing to me, but <hi>I led you fortie
yeares:</hi> to what purpose? <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that I might teach
thee</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that I might nurture thee,</hi> that thou
mightst learne to know me, and to know thy selfe:
that <hi>I might humble you,</hi> that you might learne by
that to see the vanitie and emptinesse of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So the <hi>Lord</hi> deales with his children; But yet,
my <hi>Beloved,</hi> why should you not be content to
haue him alone for your portion? he hath it for
you, it is not for want of good will towards you,
it is not for want of power, but because it is best
for you: And therefore, likewise, that is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the children of <hi>God</hi> want, and those that
are his enemies haue abundance, but they are but
land-flouds of comforts, that make a great shew,
and haue some reality in them to comfort, for the
present; but it is but a Pond, it is but a land-floud;
the spring of comfort belongs onely to the Saints,
it may be, they are but little, but yet they are
springing, they are renewed to them from day to
day, they are such springs as make glad the heart
of all the houshold of <hi>God:</hi> And therefore, what if
his enemies haue abundance? it is but as summer
flowers; though they be set in gawdy places, yet
they are but slippery places, though they flourish
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2062:47"/>
for a time, it is but the flourishing of a greene
tree, that lasts not long. And therefore be not
mistaken in that, that <hi>Gods</hi> children want, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue it, his children haue it in a better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
But I will not stand vpon this any longer.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Lord</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> then learne hence,<note place="margin">To looke onely to God in our wayes.</note>
to haue your eye onely vpon him, when you haue
any enterprise to doe; if there be any crosse, that
you would haue prevented, if there be any bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that you would obtaine, if there be any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
out of which you would haue delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
let your eye be to him alone, rest on him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
for he is <hi>All-sufficienet,</hi> he is able to bring
it to passe; as he sayth here to <hi>Abraham, I am All-sufficient,</hi>
so he will be to all that are within the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> as well as to him. And therefore, I say,
whatsoever thy case be, looke to him onely, and
thou needest no other helpe, and be readie to say
thus with thy selfe, the greatest meane, without
his helpe, is not able to bring this enterprise to
passe, it is not able to deliver me, it is not able to
comfort me, it is not able to worke such a worke
for me; and the weakest with him is able to doe it.
You see <hi>Asa</hi> was able to say this in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 14. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> sayth he, <hi>it is all one with thee to saue with
many or with few.</hi> And the <hi>Lord</hi> made it good to
him; for when he had but a few, and a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
came against him, you see he was saved
with those few; and, afterwards, when <hi>Asa</hi> had a
great multitude, he was not delivered, that he
might learne to know the truth of that which then
he heard; And therefore, sayth he, <hi>we rest vpon

thee, Oh Lord, it is all one with thee to deliver with

Therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> learne to conceiue thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
of things: we doe not vsually doe so, if we
did, what is the reason, that you provide much
for your children, &amp; all your care is to leaue them
portions? I would aske you but this question;
Whether can all that portion make them happy,
or make your selues so, or any one else? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make them happie, without <hi>Gods</hi> favour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his blessing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Put the case, againe, they had his
favour and blessing without this portion, Is not
that enough? Is it not sufficient? We may run
through many instances, but it is enough to touch
vpon this. And therefore thou shouldst be readie
to say thus with thy selfe; If I haue never so much,
if I were in the greatest floate of prosperitie, what
is this without him? If againe, I were in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ebbe, is not he enough? And therefore in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
busines say this with thy selfe; All my busines
now is with <hi>God</hi> in heaven, and not with men, nor
the creatures, and therefore, if I want comfort at
any time, if I cannot haue it from men, nor from
the creature, yet I know where to fetch it; if I want
wisedome, counsell, and advice, if I want helpe,
I know whether to goe; if the Cisterne fayle, I can
goe to the fountaine, I can goe to him alone, that
is able to be my helper in all my needs, to be my
counfeller in all my doubts, and to comfort me
in all my distresses. But, <hi>Beloved,</hi> the thing I
would presse is this, to settle your eyes vpon <hi>God</hi>
alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:2062:48"/>It may be,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> you will say, you haue an eye to <hi>God,</hi>

               <p>No:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> All the tryall is in this, to trust in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
for if you did thinke him <hi>All-sufficient;</hi>
why should you not doe so? If he had but a part
of sufficiencie, and the creature had another part,
you might joyne helpe with him; but since he is
<hi>All-sufficient,</hi> you must be content with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Put the case, he giue you no pawne, as he
did not to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Text sayth, he had not a
foote of land in all his possession, and yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved;
for he thought <hi>God</hi> was sufficient: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when thou hast any thing to doe, trust in him
alone, and thou shalt then finde it the best done:
for when we trust in him most, then we pray best,
and when we pray best, we speede best: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we commonly finde, when things are in the
lowest condition, then it hath best successe with
vs: because, by that meanes we are taught to goe
to him alone. To giue you an instance of this,
consider <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> I will shew you but
these two cases; you shall see it in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Instance. <hi>David.</hi>
                  </note> did not make hast when the <hi>Lord</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him the Kingdome, and sent <hi>Samuell</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
him, (though at one time he did, when he
fled into the land of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> yet in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
he did not) if he had made hast, he would
haue taken away <hi>Sauls</hi> life, when he was put into
his hands, but, sayth he, I will stay the <hi>Lords</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
I will not meddle with him, <hi>wickednesse shall
come from the wicked.</hi> What was the issue of it?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2062:48"/>
you see how the <hi>Lord</hi> brought it about without
paine, and labour to him, (as you shall see in the
wheeles of his providence, how he wheeled that
about, to bring <hi>David</hi> to the Kingdome) you see
first he takes away <hi>Saul</hi> by the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>Davids</hi> hand was not on him, he tooke him
away in due season. When that was done, then
there was <hi>Abner</hi> a mightie Captaine, you see, he
was taken away, and that without any fault of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
vpon a quarrell betweene <hi>Ioab</hi> and him.
When <hi>Abner</hi> was taken away, there was <hi>Isbosheth</hi>
left behinde; you see, there were two set a-worke
by his providence (for those things come to passe
by his providence) to take away his head when
he was asleepe; so that all the posteritie of <hi>Saul</hi>
was gone. He tooke not onely <hi>Saul</hi> away in the
battayle, but all the rest, and there were but two
left, <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> that was lame in his limmes,
and not fit to mannage the Kingdome, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
afterwards, put himselfe into <hi>Davids</hi> hands,
and <hi>Isbosheth,</hi> that was lame in his minde, as the
other was in his limmes. And therefore, when
<hi>Abner</hi> was gone, there was no strength in him;
So the <hi>Lord</hi> brought it to passe without any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his: so it is when men learne to trust in <hi>God.</hi>
Likewise, see it in <hi>Nabals</hi> case: he was making
hast, he was stepping out to an inordinate way to
helpe himselfe, but when he stayed himselfe, and
did it not, how did the <hi>Lord</hi> bring it to passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him? did not he himselfe take away <hi>Nabals</hi>
life, and giue <hi>Nabals</hi> wife and goods, as he did
<hi>Sauls</hi> goods, and his house, and his wiues to him?
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2062:49"/>
This the <hi>Lord</hi> did: for he trusted in him, he made
not hast, but he stayed on him alone. I say, if we
could learne this in all our enterprises, to trust in
him, he would worke our workers for vs. On the
other side; wheresoever you see a man that makes
hast, and that joynes others with the <hi>Lord,</hi> and is
not content with his <hi>All-sufficiencie;</hi> doth it not
cost him much, when he will doe his owne works,
and will not leaue it to the <hi>Lord</hi> to worke it for
him?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iacob.</note> you know, what it cost him, when he made
hast to get the blessing by a wrong way, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares exile, how much paine, and separation
from his friends? And so <hi>Saul,</hi> it cost him the
losse of his Kingdome, for making hast when he
offered sacrifice, and did breake the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>God,</hi> because the people were dispersed;
And so of the rest. And therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> what if
there be nothing besides (for that is the case I
presse) suppose you were in such a straite, that
there is no more but the <hi>Lord</hi> to rest on, yet, if
you be content to trust in him alone, he will doe
it, as he did for <hi>David;</hi> if you will needs indent,
and bargaine with him, then, I say, it may be,
you shall haue the thing you would haue, but you
had better be without it; as we see in <hi>Math.</hi> 20.
when the workemen would not be content with
the <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (as we see in that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
but would make a bargaine with the <hi>Lord,</hi>
we will not serue thee, say they, except thou wilt
giue vs so much wages, if thou wilt, we will doe it;
so he bargained with every man for a penny a day;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2062:49"/>
Goe then, sayth he, and worke in my Vineyard,
and thou shalt haue a Penny; Well, when he comes

thought that was not enough, but they murmured
against him;<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 13.</note> sayth the <hi>Lord, did you not bargaine
with me for a Penny?</hi> The meaning of it is this,
it doth most concerne the labourers in <hi>Gods</hi>
Vineyard, but it is appliable to all others. They
will not worke for the <hi>Lord,</hi> they will not reckon
him <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> but they will haue wages, they
will bargaine with him to haue a Penny. That is;
One to haue a Benefice to maintaine him; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will worke for him, if he may haue fame, and
credit, and esteeme; Another will worke for him,
if he may haue some great place. Sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi>
I will giue thee that Penny, thou shalt worke in
my Vineyard; I but when a man hath it, (marke
it) he murmurs, why? for when the end of the
day comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he sees that preferment, that riches,
that credit, are but emptie things, they are but
small things when he is to go into another world,
there is nothing left for him, he is naked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
it is but a Penny, and therefore he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs
and complaines. That is; He sees now that
it was but a poore bargaine that he made; But,
sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi> thou wouldst needs bargaine with
me for a Penny, and thou hast it. So, I say, to
those that are not content with the <hi>Lords All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,</hi>
but will haue present wages, they will
bargaine with the <hi>Lord:</hi> He will giue thee this
particular, thou shalt haue this, but remember this,
that it is sayd in <hi>Math. 6. thou hast thy reward.</hi>

If thou wilt haue prayse of men, and wile doe it

he will giue thee thy portion. The Sonne that

But if a man will haue his portion, and will not

thou hast to doe with him, <hi>that made heaven and

as knowing this providence of his, that sets the
Angels a-worke, all the hoasts, all the particulars
of them in their kinde, to doe this busines and that
busines? Who walkes with <hi>God,</hi> as seeing him
sending a messenger to doe every thing that we
see done in the world, sending a messenger to
take away such a mans life, to giue another life

when you see a concurrence of two things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the cause whereof you know not, but he

him do this or that, through the ends of the earth.
Againe, <hi>he holds the windes in his fist;</hi> who sees
him as such a <hi>God,</hi> that is able to hold the windes
in his fist? Who lookes vpon him as such a <hi>God?</hi>
The breath of a man, that is lesse then the winde,
he holds it in his fist, as a man holds a thing in

Who lookes vpon <hi>God,</hi> as thus great in power?
And so againe, breathing the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> who

Who lookes vpon him, as one sending forth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

it this way, or that way, as the windes, and the
stormes, and the Creatures? He hath them all in
his hand, and holds them all in his fist: for by these
workes of nature, we may learne to know the
greatnesse of <hi>God,</hi> and to reflect vpon our selues,
and see how farre we are short of him.</p>
               <p>And so againe, who lookes vpon him as lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
vp the waters as in a garment? That is;
When the Sea is outragious, yet he takes it as
you would take a little water in your lap some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and he containes it, and gathers it vp,
and sometimes he lets it loose againe. And so
likewise, he is able, when the people are vnruly,
even great Nations that sometimes are readie to
over-spread his Church, and to run over it with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2062:53"/>
proud waters, yet he is able to keepe them backe,
he is able to restraine them, and to shut them vp
with barres and doores, as he doth the waters.
He that lappes the waters in a garment, is he not
able to restraine men that are violent against vs in
wrath? Who can stand before wrath, and envie,
that is like a violent water, that overflowes all, and
that carries all before it? Yet he that laps the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

wheresoever he findes them. And so againe, who
walks with him, as knowing him that establisheth
the ends of the earth. That is; (as the originall
shewes more clearely) as one that hath founded

Sayth he, that <hi>God</hi> (when a mans spirit hath insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,

to prop him, nothing to vnderlay him, yet he (that
hath set the earth vpon nothing, but vpon the

it, but he onely sayth to the earth stand there) is
he not able to support a man in any case? See now
the <hi>Lord</hi> in this greatnesse of his. But who walkes
as seeing him thus in his greatnesse, and in his
<hi>All-sufficiencie?</hi> For all these doe but expresse
the <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> of <hi>God. Beloved,</hi> if we did it,
why are our hearts discouraged? Why doe wee
hang downe our heads vpon every occasion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2062:54"/>
when troubles come? If we see the <hi>Lord</hi> in his <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi>
he is able to stay our hearts, if we trust
in him alone. What though he suffer his Church
to be over-runne with enemies for a time? What
though he suffer men to prevayle against it, (as
you see how the Adversaries prevayle against the
Church of <hi>God</hi> by their strength) yet, if you did
see him in his <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi> your hearts would
not fayle you a jot. You may either apply it to the
Churches, or to your own particular cases. (And
to giue you yet an insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of these sensible things.)
When the disease prevayled farre on <hi>Hezekiah;</hi>
sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi> thou seest <hi>Hezekiah</hi> what I can do,
<hi>I will make the shadow to goe backwards.</hi> Thinke
with thy selfe; Though the disease be gone thus
farre, yet I, that make the shadow to goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
am I not able to make thy disease to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne?
And so we may say of any trouble, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,

no recalling of it againe, yet he that made the

it? And so againe, when you see the Church in
such a case as it is now in, we are readie to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all hope, and to say, What shall we doe?
<hi>Beloved,</hi> consider that which was sayd to <hi>Gideon</hi>
(as we are readie to say, when we say the <hi>Lord</hi> is

Why is <hi>Israell</hi> oppressed? Sayth the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

The like, you see, in <hi>Gen. 15.</hi> where there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
resemblance of the Church, when the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
were cut in peeces, and he had divided the
Rammes; sayth the Text, the <hi>Fowles come and
would haue devoured them.</hi> There are two simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of the troubles of the Church, and <hi>Gods</hi> res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing
them. When the Crowes came, <hi>Abraham
droue them away.</hi> That was one. And the other was,
when there was a very fearefull darkenesse, there
came a <hi>Burning Fornace, and a Lampe.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is this; The Church then was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> (for
that he hath reference to) it was a dead Sheepe,
exposed to Ravens, and you would thinke there
was nothing there to helpe it, but it must needs
be devoured. Why yet sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi> though it
be thus neere, I will driue away the Ravens, and
I will saue my Church. You know, what the
strength of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and of <hi>Egypt</hi> was. Againe,
sayth he, the Church was in fearefull darknesse,
in the valley of the shadow of death. That is;
They thought they should never be recovered,
you know, what wayes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> tooke, and at how
low an ebbe the Church was, when he would
haue all the males destroyed. Who would haue
said, that this Church should haue recovered?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2062:55"/>
Yet, sayth he, as, after this fearefull darkenes, the
Fornace came and gaue light, so, sayth he, I will
scatter this darknes. <hi>Beloved,</hi> consider, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> and consider, if thou
dost thus know him in his greatnes, what though
the motions be exceeding great and strong that
come against the Church, yet in <hi>Esay 40.</hi> (it is to
that purpose brought in) What are they to the
<hi>Lord? they are but as the dust of the Ballance, or as
the drop of a Bucket.</hi> The Bucket it selfe is no great
thing, but the droppes that fall from the Bucket,
when it ariseth out of the Well, they are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
small; Sayth he, the Nations are no more to
me, than the drop of a Bucket, or the dust of the
Ballance, which doth not sway them either way;
So, looke what I doe, the Nations are notable to
sway me, be they never so strong, they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to turne me, but according as I pitch things
they shall stand.</p>
               <p>Now my <hi>Beloved,</hi> consider whether you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comfort your selues thus out of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie.</hi>
We doe, for the most part, as <hi>Hagar</hi>
did, when the Bottle was spent, she falls a crying,
shee was vndone, shee and her childe should dye,
and there was no more hope, till the <hi>Lord</hi> opened
her eyes to see a Fountaine neere her; the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
was neere her, but she saw it not; when she
saw it, she was well enough. Is it not so with vs
all? because the Bottle is dryed vp, because such a
meanes is taken away, we thinke presently there
is no more hope, when the Fountaine is neere,
the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe is the fountaine, and he is neere,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2062:55"/>
if he did open your eyes to see. Consider whether
you walke thus with <hi>God,</hi> as seeing him in his
greatnesse. <hi>Beloved,</hi> if we did see him in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
why should Torches and Candles haue so
great a light before vs? That is; Why should we
regard men so much? Put the case, many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were against thee, thou wouldst looke vpon
all those in comparison of <hi>God,</hi> as a drop of the
Bucket, or as a little dust on the Ballance.
Art thou able to doe so, to see and know
him thus in his greatnesse? if thou be
not, certainly, thou art excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
short of seeing <hi>God</hi> in

neither is he worshipped with mens hands,</hi> as if he
needed any thing. (Marke) he giues to all life,
and breath, and all things. Thus the Apostle
makes his argument; if <hi>God,</hi> sayth he, made the
world, and all things therein, if he giueth to all
life, and breath, and all things; then, when you
doe worship him, it is not because he hath any

sayth the <hi>Lord</hi> there, <hi>If I be hungry, I will not tell
thee.</hi> That is; To shew how little neede he hath of
Sacrifices, how little regard he had them, when
they were brought in, and how little he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
when they fayled in it. For, sayth he, <hi>all are

I may satisfie my selfe, (I doe but apply it by way
of allusion) if I would haue Sacrifice in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
might I not haue it? If I were hungry after
them, who could keepe them from me? We may
say the same of the obedience of his children: If
he were hungry. That is; If he were desirous of
perfect and absolute obedience, could he not haue
it? Hath he not spirit enough? Hath he not grace
enough to put into their hearts, that he might
reape the full fruits of righteousnesse? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I say, in regard of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> he
needs it not; and if he need it not, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a more imperfect measure of it, since he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2062:57"/>
is no looser by it. This is to perswade our hearts
more fully of that truth, which wee assent vnto
with some difficultie: for we are something dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with the imperfections of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
whose faith is not weakned by it? who
comes not more vnchearfully before <hi>God,</hi> because
of it? Now, if that feare were taken away, we
would draw neere more boldly. We see what <hi>Iob</hi>
sayth in this case,<note place="margin">Iob 35. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob 35. 6. 7. If thou sinnest, what
dost thou against him, yea, when thy sinnes are many,
what dost thou to him? If thou be righteous, what gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
thou to him? or what receiues he at thy hands?</hi>
Marke, you know, sinne and righteousnesse, are
the two pathes that we walke in, those are all that
trouble vs; the sinnes that we commit, and the
defects of our righteousnesse. Sayth he, <hi>if thou
sinne, what is that to him?</hi> It doth him no hurt.
Againe, if thou fayle in thy righteousnesse, or in
thy performances, it is all one that way: for it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
not to him: because he is blessed for ever,
he hath all <hi>sufficiencie</hi> in himselfe: and therefore
he pleaseth so to administer the world, and so to
guide the hearts of his children, and to dispense
to them but such a measure of grace, to leaue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
lusts in them in such a measure vnmortified;
because himselfe is neither a gainer, nor a looser:
therefore let not your faith be weakned at this his
administration of things, let not carnall feares

               <p>These are the three parts of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which

<hi>A new heart will I giue you, also a new spirit will I

the heart is readie to object against these three,

is exceeding hard. Who is able so fully to beleeue
the forgiuenes of his sinnes, as he ought? Who is
able to doe it when he is put to it? At the day of

true: If I were as man is, it could not be, but I
should execute the fiercenesse of my wrath vpon
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> who hath provoked me so exceedingly
(for <hi>Ephraim</hi> was a part of <hi>Israell,</hi> and is put for all
<hi>Israell;</hi> and the <hi>Prophet</hi> wrote this in the time of
<hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ioash,</hi> when <hi>Israell</hi> aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in sinnes, and in Idolatry) but, sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi>
though their sinnes be exceeding great, yet I am
able to forgiue them: for I am <hi>God,</hi> and not man.
As if he should say; Looke vpon weake man, and
compare <hi>God</hi> and man together, and see how farre
<hi>God</hi> exceeds man: see how much he is stronger
then man, being infinite and almightie; so, sayth
he, his mercy exceeds the mercy of man. As if he
should say; If I were not <hi>God,</hi> it were impossible I
should forgiue the sinnes of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which they
haue multiplied against me from time to time.
So,<note place="margin">Isa. 55. 7.</note> likewise, in <hi>Esay.</hi> 55. 7. the <hi>Lord</hi> cals them in

word signifieth in the originall; when a man
makes this objection. But it is more then any
man can beleeue, that my sinnes that I haue thus
and thus repeated, that the <hi>Lord</hi> can so easily put
them away, and multiply his pardons, as I haue
multiplied my sinnes? Sayth he, <hi>my thoughts are
not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but as high as the heaven is aboue the earth, so are my
thoughts aboue your thoughts, and my wayes aboue
your wayes.</hi> That is; As a man lookes to heaven,
and considers the great distance betweene the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2062:61"/>
earth, and it, so farre, sayth he, doe my thoughts
exceede your thoughts. That is; When you thinke
with your selues, I cannot forgiue; because you
measure me, and draw a scantling of me by your
selues, when you haue gone to the vtmost of your
thoughts, my thoughts exceede yours as much
as heaven exceeds the earth. And therefore, sayth
he, my wayes are not as your wayes. That is;
When you would not forgiue, yet I am able to
forgiue in so great a disproportion. We doe with
this as we doe with all the Attributes of <hi>God,</hi> we
are able to thinke him powerfull as a man, but to
thinke him powerfull as <hi>God,</hi> there we come short.
We are able to thinke him mercifull as a man,
but to thinke him mercifull as <hi>God,</hi> there our
thoughts are at an end; we can thinke and see no
reason why he should pardon vs. Now, sayth the
<hi>Lord,</hi> my thoughts goe beyond your thoughts as
much as the distance is betweene heaven &amp; earth.
If you say to me, who doubts of this, that the <hi>Lord</hi>
is able to forgiue? My <hi>Beloved,</hi> if we did not doubt
of it; what is the reason, when great sinnes are
committed, that you fall to questioning of <hi>Gods</hi>
mercy, when you can more easily beleeue a smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
sinne to be forgiven? Therefore, certainly, men
doubt of his power, whether he be able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue:
for, if the difference of sinne, doe cause in
you vnbeliefe, it could not be that you should
pitch vpon the power of <hi>God,</hi> and his readines to
forgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is called in question, and, therefore, the
thing we haue to do, is, to make this good to you,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2062:62"/>
that the <hi>Lord</hi> is able to forgiue. But you will say
to me: It is true; If it were a matter of power,
I make no question. <hi>Beloved,</hi> you shall finde it a
matter of power: take a man; Is it not a matter
of strength in him to forgiue, to passe by an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie?
If it be strength in a man to be meeke, to
forgiue, and to passe by iniuries, to be kinde to
those that be vnkinde to him; Is it not also power
in <hi>God</hi> to doe so? Besides, is it not a power to be
rich? Riches giue a man a potencie, and the <hi>Lord</hi>
is said to be rich in mercy. That is; As a man
that is rich, though he giue much, yet he is not
exhausted; So, when you haue made thus much
vse of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, yet still there is more behinde,
still there is more and more mercy for you, there
is a spring of mercy, there is no end of it. Besides,
as there is a power in his wrath; <hi>Who knowes the
power of his wrath?</hi> so likewise, there is a power in
his mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we see <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. 23.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22. 23</note> (it is a place

Now, as it is hard to finde out the depth of the
one, so it is to finde out the depth of the other, to
consider the height, the length, and bredth, and
depth of his mercy. When a man considers his
sinnes, and lookes vpon them in the height of
them, in the bredth, and depth of them, when he
sees a heape of sinne piled vp together, reaching
vp to the heavens, and downe againe to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

make this objection, when he lookes vpon <hi>Gods</hi>
wayes, the wayes of righteousnesse, and then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the strength of his lusts, he is ready to say with
himselfe: how shall I be able to leade a holy life,
as I ought to doe? This is the answer to it; <hi>God is
All-sufficient.</hi>
He that is able to bid the light shine
out of darknesse, sayth the Apostle, he is able to
kindle a light in thy darke heart, where there is
not a jot of goodnesse; though thy heart be never
so averse, he is able to change that heart of thine,
and therefore say not, I shall never be able to doe
it: for he is able to take away all that reluctancy.</p>
               <p>

strength of my lusts, this crooked and perverse

               <p>It is very true.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Is thy heart continue in that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
it is impossible;<note place="margin">God changeth the nature of things.</note> but the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
is able to take away that reluctancie: for
he doth in the worke of grace, as he doth in the
worke of nature: he doth not as we doe, when we
would haue an Arrow goe to the marke, when we
throw a stone vpward, we are not able to change
the nature of it, but we put it on by force: <hi>God</hi>
carries all things to their end, by giving them a
nature suitable to that end. An Archer makes an
impression vpon an Arrow, but it is a violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
<hi>God</hi> carries every thing to that end, to
which he hath appoynted it; but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
he makes not a violent impression, but a
naturall impression, &amp; therefore he doth it not by
an onely immediate hand of his owne, as we doe,
but he causeth the Creature to goe on of it selfe,
to this or to that purpose, to this or that end. And
so he doth in the worke of grace; he doth not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a man on to the wayes of righteousnesse, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him in the state of nature, taking him as he
is, but he takes away that heart of his, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints
the habits of grace in it, and he changeth a
mans heart, so that he is carried willingly to the
wayes of <hi>God,</hi> as the creature is carried by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
instinct to its owne place, or to the thing it
desires. So that thou mayst thinke thus with thy
selfe: It is true; if I haue my old heart, my old lusts
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2062:65"/>
still, there must needs be such a reluctancy, as I
shall not be able to overcome; but, if the <hi>Lord</hi>

he putteth into the creature, then it is easie for me
to doe it. And this the <hi>Lord</hi> out of his <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie</hi>

such facilitie and connaturalnesse to the wayes of
his Commandements, why am I thus? why am I
no more able to overcome my sinnes? why doe I
fall backe so often to the same sinne? why doe I
come short of the performance of such purposes
and desires? why doe I finde so many things in
my life contrary to the Rules of Sanctification,
and so contrary to this <hi>All-sufficient</hi> power of
<hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> First; It may be it is from
hence, that thou observest not those Rules by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which <hi>God</hi> communicates this <hi>All-sufficiency,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We obserue not Gods Rules.</note> and
this power of his. What though the <hi>Lord</hi> be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to communicate it, yet there are some Rules
to be observed, which himselfe hath given. That
is; Thou must diligently attend vpon his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
thou must observe and keepe them, thou must
be carefull to abstaine from the occasions he bids
thee abstaine from: if thou sayle in either of these,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2062:66"/>
he hath made thee no promise to helpe thee with
his <hi>All-sufficiencie. Sampson,</hi> as long as the <hi>Lord</hi>
was with him, you know, had great strength, you
know, the <hi>Lord</hi> tels him so long as he nourished
his hayre, so long he would be with him, which
was but a symboll of <hi>Gods</hi> presence, but it was such
a thing, as he would haue him to keepe exactly,
and, if he did not keepe that, he would withdraw
his presence, and would not be with him. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the <hi>Nazarites</hi> were commanded to abstaine
from drinking wine, if they dranke wine, the <hi>Lord</hi>
would withdraw himselfe. And so it is in this
case: the <hi>Lord</hi> hath appointed vs to keepe his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and so long he will be with vs, as he was
with <hi>Sampson,</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient</hi> to vs, to giue vs
strength to inable vs to doe the duties he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
vs, and to abstaine from the evils he would
not haue vs to doe. But we must keepe his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and goe by his Rules, and if we fayle in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, that we neglect the meanes, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
vpon the occasions, now the <hi>Lord</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of his promise, as we may so say, the <hi>Lord</hi>
now withdraws his power from vs, as he did from
<hi>Sampson. If you will needs marry with such a people,</hi>
sayth the <hi>Lord, they shall turne away your hearts:</hi>
for now I will not keepe you. If you will needs
touch that tree, if you will needs goe into such a
company, if you will needs gaze vpon such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
or, if againe, you will neglect prayer, and
hearing, and sanctifying the Sabbath, if you will
neglect to obserue the Rules that he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in all these cases, the <hi>Lord</hi> withdrawes his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2062:66"/>
                  <hi>All-sufficiencie.</hi> And therefore lay the fault where
it is; That is; Vpon your selues. Doe not say with
thy selfe, it is because the <hi>Lord</hi> is not <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
but rather thinke, that he hath power to goe
through the worke he hath appointed me to doe,
but it is because I haue not kept those Rules, I haue
neglected the meanes, I haue ventured vpon such
occasions.</p>
               <p>Secondly.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Consider with thy selfe, that the <hi>Lord</hi>
doth this to humble thee. It may be, he is as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to be bestow a greater measure of grace,<note place="margin">To humble vs.</note> but he
dispenseth a lesser measure; it is that the heart
may be kept humble: for humilitie is the nurse
of graces, take away that and grace withers in the
heart. And therefore when he is willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
a mercy, or a grace on vs, he doth as he did
with <hi>Iacob,</hi> he leaves a lamenesse together with it,
he will not so bestow it on vs, that he will make
vs perfect, but he leaues some defects, some wants,
that by that, humilitie may be preserved, and that
may cause vs to cleaue to him, and depend vpon
him, that he may keepe vs from an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
in our selues, and teach vs to waite on him: for
without that he doth not communicate, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
vnto vs that sufficiencie that is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>Moreover;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Consider with thy selfe, that the
<hi>Lord</hi> many times suffereth vs to see changes in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
our liues &amp; conversations,<note place="margin">That we may know God and our selues better.</note> that by them we may
learne to know him better, and our selues also;
if we were able to doe it by our selues, the <hi>Lord</hi>
would spare vs, but who is able to doe it? It is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2062:67"/>
said in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> that <hi>therefore the wicked feare
not God, because they haue no changes,</hi> and truely, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the godly men, if they had no changes, they
would feare him lesse, so that every change in a
mans state, and the falling into sinne, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
againe, leades a man to some new knowledge
of <hi>God,</hi> and of himselfe also, to a new experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
knowledge, and that knowledge leades him to
a new degree of feare: so that still by their sinnes
they get advantage, that they shall finde in their
spirituall estate: for, even as we see the Sun when
it breakes out of a thicke Cloud of darknesse, it
shines the brighter, so grace when it breakes out
of a thicke cloud of sinnes, or of temptations, it
shines the brighter, we are still gainers by those
changes. I say, we learne to know <hi>God,</hi> and our
selues also the better, and for these causes he
leaues vs to those changes, that we may be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by them, and so we are. Therefore, say not
with thy selfe, because I finde some defects, and
some unevennesse in my sanctification, therefore
the <hi>Lord</hi> is not sufficient: for it is for thy advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
it is not for want of sufficiencie in the <hi>Lord,</hi>
nor of willingnesse in him to communicate it to
thee, but it is for thy adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, that thou shouldst
finde these changes, and this vnevennesse in thy
wayes. Therefore, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> build vpon this
that he is <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> It may be, when thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
about a worke thy selfe, thou findest it a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing to overcome such a lust, but that which
is impossible with men, is easie with <hi>God.</hi> Those
that rowed all night, and did no good, a word
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2062:67"/>
from his mouth brought them to shore presently.
<hi>The spirit that is in vs lusteth after envie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 4. 5. 6.</note> Iames 4.
<hi>but the Scriptures offer more grace.</hi> That is; Grace
is able to heale these naturall hereditary diseases,
there is an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> in him, he is able to doe
it; He that can still the Sea, and command the
windes, that at his word they are quiet, can he
not still strong lusts? He is able to restraine them:
therefore labour to see his <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> in this,
as well as in all things else. Thinke with thy selfe,
he hath a soveraignty over all thy affections, over
all thy lusts: for what is it that troubles vs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts
vs in our way, but some temptations of
the flesh, or the world? Is not the <hi>Lord</hi> the Master
of them? As <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. though Sathan
were the chiefe Buffetter,<note place="margin">Lusts are at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> and the lusts of the flesh
the messengers, yet the <hi>Lord</hi> sent that messenger,
(marke it) therefore he goes not to Sathan, he
wrangles not with the messenger, but he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
sought the LORD, he beseeches him
to recall it. So thinke with thy selfe, when
thou art set on with a strong lust, with a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that seemes too hard for thee, say with thy
selfe, this is a messenger from <hi>God,</hi> and I must goe
to <hi>God,</hi> and beseech him to take it off, and rebuke
it: for he is able to doe it, he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
they are all at his command, as the mastiue is at
the Maisters command, he is able to rate him,
but a stranger is not able to doe it, and when he
hath done that which his master would haue him,
he cals him in;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi>
                  </note> so the Shepheard sets his dogge
vpon his Sheepe to bring them in, but when they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2062:68"/>
are brought in, he rates his dogge: And so doth
the <hi>Lord</hi> with lusts, and sinne, and temptations,
he sets them on his owne Sheepe, his owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but for this end, to bring them in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not
in their owne power to rate these temptations,
and lusts, nor in the power of a stranger, but
onely in the <hi>Lords,</hi> who is Maister of them, whose
messengers they are, he is able to rebuke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
them, they are at his command, as it is sayd
of the diseases of the bodie, they are like the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions</hi>
servants, if <hi>he bid one goe he goeth,</hi> if <hi>he bid
another come, he commeth:</hi> so it is true of the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the soule; if he say to such a messenger as
<hi>Paul</hi> had, to such a lust, to such a temptation,
goe, and seaze vpon such a man, goe, and vexe
him for a time, it shall goe; if againe, he call it
backe, and restraine it, shall it not be restrained?
Labour thus to see <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>Beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We stand in <hi>Gods</hi> strength, as we may see</note> if you looke vpon other men, or

                  <note place="margin">In others.</note> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and all the Saints, so long <hi>as God</hi>

strength was like the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of <hi>Sampson:</hi> but when
the <hi>Lord</hi> withdrew himselfe, we see what base lusts
they fell into; what lusts was <hi>David</hi> given vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
Also <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Lot.</hi> All this the
<hi>Lord</hi> hath done, even for this purpose, that they

him, and not in them. Therefore, when thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
on any Saint of <hi>God</hi> that excels in grace, and
goes beyond thee, thinke thus with thy selfe; it is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2062:68"/>
not because this man is stronger then I, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Lord</hi> hath done more for him, he hath
bestowed more grace vpon him: he that hath done
this to him, is he not able to doe it to thee? He
that is so strong, if the <hi>Lord</hi> withdraw his hand,
thou feest what he is. And therefore comfort thy
selfe with this, that he is able to strengthen thee.
Thinke againe with thy selfe, how thou hast found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
him at other times.<note place="margin">In our selues.</note> My <hi>Beloved,</hi> there is great
strength in this, even when thou art at the worst,
to keepe life in the roote of grace; in the Winter

the workes of nature, to keepe life in the Plants,
when they seeme to be dead, that the hardnesse,

those that are unnaturall,<note place="margin">A double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in the soule.</note> and inordinate. There
is a double desire in the heart of man, as there is a
double thirst: there is a naturall thirst, you know,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which is easily satisfied with a little;<note place="margin">Naturall.</note> there is an
unnaturall thirst, as the thirst of a dropsie man,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
who desires exceeding much,<note place="margin">Vnnaturall.</note> and the more you
giue him, still the more he desires, and is never
satisfied. So, it is with the soule; there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
healthful desire, which desires so much credit,
and so much wealth, as is needfull; there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, an vnnaturall desire of the soule, when
a man doth long after abundance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now, <hi>Beloved,</hi>
doe not looke that the <hi>Lord</hi> should satisfie this,
nay, the best way, in this case, is not to satisfie,
but to take from our desires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we say of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2062:70"/>
                  <hi>Boulemeia,</hi> that disease wherein a man eates much,
that is called <hi>Caninus appetitus,</hi> and likewise, in the
dropsie, the one excessiuely eates, and the other
excessiuely drinkes; and the Rule of <hi>Physitians</hi> is,
<hi>Opus habent purgatione non impletione,</hi> such a man
hath neede of purging and emptying, and not of
filling; so I may say of all these, such men haue
neede of purging and emptying, which is to be
desired in this case: that wherein <hi>God</hi> shewes his
<hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> now, is not in supplying thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
in adding that which thou desirest, but in
purging the heart, and taking away those desires;
that is the way to heale thee: Therefore consider
seriovsly what that is that thou desirest, if it be an
inordinate desire, if it be a worke of fancie, know,
that thou canst not looke for this <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> to satisfie this, but to heale it. You shall see
<hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 5. 10.<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>He that loueth silver shall not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with silver, and he that loveth riches, shall be
without the fruit thereof.</hi> You see what the <hi>Lord</hi>
hath set downe concerning this case: now a man
may seeke for a competency, but when he comes
once to riches, that he seekes for them, the <hi>Lord</hi>
sayth, such a man shall not be satisfied, or, if he
be, it shall be in wrath: for it is in wrath given to
such a man. It is the destruction of a dropsie man,
to haue much drinke given him, or to giue a man
much meate that is sicke of the disease, we spake
of before. And therefore, sayth he, he shall not be
satisfied, or, if he be, it shall be in Iudgement:
Such are these desires, and therefore examine thy
selfe, whether thy desires be not such as proceede
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2062:70"/>
from fancy, such as proceede not from the health,
but the weaknesse of the soule. Therefore it is said
in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that godlinesse is great gaine with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</hi>
How doth godlines giue contentment?
<hi>Beloved,</hi> after that manner that Physicke giues sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
A dropsie man after he is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
health,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> you know, he is contented with lesse
drinke, for now he is in health, <hi>God</hi> brings the
soule to a good temper, he takes away the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the lustfull humors, that were there before,
and brings him into a right temper, it giues him
now the content that before he wanted.</p>
               <p>Againe.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> Another objection is; If <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient</hi>
for these outward things, why am I thus
crossed? why doe I suffer these afflictions? why
are they not removed from me?</p>
               <p>To this I answer briefly.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Thou mayst be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in them,<note place="margin">That is not alway good for vs, that we desire.</note> that which thou makest account is
so great an evill to thee, it may be for thy great
good, as we see <hi>Ier.</hi> 42.<note place="margin">Ier. 42.</note> that whole Chapter, the
Captaine there, and the rest of the people, they
reckoned it an exceeding great misery, a very
great affliction to continue in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they had
a great desire to goe downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but the
<hi>Lord</hi> tels them, they were very much deceived:
for this misery shall be for your good, sayth he,
but, if you will needs goe downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when
you thinke to haue abundance of all things there,
you shall meete with the Sword, and with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and with the Pestilence, and with vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
So, I say, in this case, we are often times
deceived, we thinke that to be good for vs which
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2062:71"/>
is not. Certainly, the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> he will
with-hold no good thing, but it is not alwayes
good to haue such an afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> removed, perhaps,
it were better for thee to beare it, it were better
for thee to lye vnder it, then that it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
we doe, in this case, many times with the
<hi>Lord,</hi> as the children of the Prophets dealt with
<hi>Elisha;</hi> they would needs goe to seeke the body of
<hi>Eliah, Elisha</hi> forbad them, but still they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,
sayth he, if you will needs goe, goe,
but they lost their labour, they had better to haue
taken his counsell at the first: And so in this case,
many times when the <hi>Lord</hi> would haue vs to doe
such a thing, and to be content with the want of
such a comfort, to be content to suffer such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in our estate, in our bodies, in our businesse,
we are still importunate with him, sometimes he
hearkens to vs, he suffers the thing to be done,
but we were as good to want it. I would aske thee
in this case, wouldst thou haue it without thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
good will? If thou haue it, it will doe thee no
good: The best way in this is to consider with thy
selfe, that he is <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> though this affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seeme to be exceeding bitter, yet it is a cup of
thy Fathers providing, it is that which the <hi>Lord,</hi>
that loues thee, hath ordained, it is that which the
<hi>Lord,</hi> that wants nothing, who is able enough to
take it from thee, and to supply it, it is that which
he hath seene meete to dispence to thee: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not for want of sufficiencie in him, but it
is better for thee to suffer the want of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
or to lye vnder this crosse or affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:2062:71"/>But lastly,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> some will say, if the <hi>Lord</hi> be <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
and I must be subiect to his will, why is it
not his will to put me into a higher condition?
why hath he given me but such a measure of gifts,
but such a meane place, but such a quantitie of
health, of wealth, of vnderstanding? a mans heart
will goe further, if there be such riches in <hi>God,</hi> such
an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in him, why is it not better with
me? why am I not in a higher condition?</p>
               <p>To this,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> I answer. First; That he that entereth
into Covenant with <hi>God,</hi> he should be content <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
with the lowest place in all the family,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Christian should be content with a mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> place in Gods house.</note> and be glad
that he is within the dore, as we see the <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>digall</hi>
did, and so the Apostle <hi>Paul, I am the least of all
the Saints,</hi> and he was contented to be the least.
A man that hath beene truely humbled and
brought home to <hi>God,</hi> that hath tasted and seene
how gracious the <hi>Lord</hi> is, that hath had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his owne sinne, and of <hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse,
he will be content with the least measure, if he be
put into the lowest place, if he be made the least
of all Saints, he will not exalt himselfe aboue that
measure, and that place that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him.</p>
               <p>But besides this;<note place="margin">Those that are meane in some things, may excell in others.</note> Consider, secondly, further <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
with thy selfe, that, if thou haue a lower place, or
condition in this, or that thing, yet, it may be, thou
hast a higher condition in somewhat else, and
know this, that <hi>God</hi> giues no man all things, but
hath mingled his comforts, he hath dispensed
them diversly,<note place="margin">1 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 2.</note> as we see in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. in that case
betweene <hi>Hannah,</hi> and <hi>Peninnah, Hannah</hi> had the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2062:72"/>
loue of her husband, but the <hi>Lord</hi> had made her
barren: On the other side; <hi>Peninnah</hi> had children,
but she wanted the loue of her husband: it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
noted there, that you may see how the
<hi>Lord</hi> dispenseth his comforts: And so it was with
<hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachell,</hi> the one, you know, had children,
and wanted her husbands loue, the other had a
greater abundance of loue, but shee was barren.
As it was with these, so generally the <hi>Lord</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
good and evill together. There is no man
that hath all things. You see <hi>Moses,</hi> he wanted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
that <hi>Aaron</hi> had, as <hi>Moses</hi> againe had
the wisedome, that <hi>Aaron</hi> wanted: so <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> they had different excellencies, the one
had that the other wanted, and so it is generally.
Therefore thinke with thy selfe, there is no man
that hath all, and why should I desire it? there
must be a mingling of some defects.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe. Thirdly; Consider with thy selfe, that
the varieties of the sufficiencies that <hi>God</hi> giues to
men,<note place="margin">God can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the desires in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> that he placeth some in a higher degree and
some in a lower, to some he giues greater gifts,
to some lesser, some he makes rich, and some
poor, some honourable, and some base; this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
in all the workes of <hi>God</hi> takes not away from
the perfection of each one: every man in his place
may haue a perfection, he may haue it within his
spheare, so that there shall be no want at all: for
the <hi>Lord,</hi> out of his almightie power, is able to
doe it, that the desire may be satisfied as much,
they may be filled in a lower condition as well as
in a greater, thou shalt feele no more want, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2062:72"/>
haue as great a degree of happinesse as the other,
you know, there are sundry expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in that case.
A little Bottle is as well filled as a greater. What
can a man desire more but to be satisfied? And
therein <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> there is in him an
<hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> to fill every Creature in his owne
spheare, and compasse, when he hath made ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of glory, they are not all of one sort, but of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
sorts, some of one, some of another sort, but
they are all vessels of glory, they haue all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his riches, and of his mercies, so that none
haue cause to complaine.</p>
               <p>Last of all; Consider in that meannesse of place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
gifts,<note place="margin">A Christians faithfulnesse is accepted in a meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> or condition, that thou art in; consider, thou
mayst be as faithfull in a little, as another may be
in much: Consider, that he that hath much, yet
there is nothing his, but the sinceritie wherewith
a man hath vsed that which he hath, werewith he
performes all that he doth: he that hath the gifts
that <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had, that excellency of gifts,
it is not his, but the Churches, all that is his is but
his faithfulnes in dispensing those gifts, they are
not his owne, but they are bestowed vpon him;
and he that hath the lesser measure of gifts, he that
hath the lower part given him to act, while he is
on the stage of this world, is accepted according
to his faithfulnes, every man shall be rewarded
according to his faithfulnes, every man shall be rewarded
according to his faithfulnes and sinceritie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
content thy selfe with a lower condition, say
not that <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> because thou
hast not a higher degree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thou seest here is an

and to defend thee from all evill. It may stand
with a great difference of condition, though thou
be not so high as another, though thou haue not
so much grace, though thou haue not so high a

in <hi>forgiving;</hi> He is <hi>All-sufficient</hi> in
<hi>sanctifying</hi> vs; And he is <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>

<hi>God is All-sufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; This should leade vs to a further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of the insufficiencie of the Creature.<note place="margin">The insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the Creature proved.</note> (That
we will first doe, and after it we will adde but a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to all that we haue said, to see whether we be
indeede perswaded of that <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi> that is
in <hi>God,</hi> and of that vanitie, and emptines that is in
the Creature; And this will be our busines at this
time.) If <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and that exclusiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as I shewed before, then there is an emptines,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2062:74"/>
a vanitie, and an indigence in the Creature, there
is nothing in it: and to make this good to you,
consider;</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First; That the Creature is made by some thing
else without it.<note place="margin">It is made by another.</note> It is certaine, no creature is able to
make it selfe: for that which makes another, must
be before another; if a creature could make it
selfe, it must be before it selfe, and therefore all
things are made by <hi>God;</hi> by this <hi>All-sufficient God.</hi>
Now then, if that which makes the creature be
something without it selfe, then the end of the
creature, must be some thing also without it selfe:
for it is the maker that is the efficient cause of all
things, and in all things that propounds an end
to it selfe, and the end of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing, you know,
is the perfection of the thing; so that here we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that all the perfection of the creature is
without it selfe, for if the end be the perfection,
and the end to which every creature is carried, is
without it selfe, it must needs be, that, it hath no
perfection, nor excellency within it selfe: hence it
is, that every creature is bound to doe something
for another, the inanimate, and vnreasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for man, and man for <hi>God:</hi> because all are
made for a further end. The <hi>Almightie God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
the <hi>All-sufficient God,</hi> that hath no efficient
cause, and, by consequent, no end without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
he may doe all for himselfe, and for his owne
sake, and his owne glory; if he will dispense with
the creature, and doe good or ill to the creature,
and make himselfe the end of all that he doth. I
say, he may well doe it: for he hath no higher end;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2062:74"/>
But if any creature shall say, I will seeke no further
end, but to haue an happines and perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mine owne compasse, it is all one, as if the
herbe should say, I will not be beholding to the
Sunne, but I will liue of my selfe, or I will not be
beholding to the rayne, &amp;c. this creature must
needs perish, because his end and perfection is
without himselfe altogether; It is as if the hand
should say, I will seeke a perfection in my owne
spheare, as I am such a part, as I am such a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
without looking to the soule, that giues life,
or without looking to the rest of the body it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in, this is the way to destroy it: So it is with
every creature; if it seeke a perfection within it
selfe, it is the undoing of it selfe. On the other side;
when it denies it selfe, when it emptieth it selfe,
when it lookes for nothing within its owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
but goes out of it selfe, and out of every
creature besides, to that Ocean of happines, from
whence it must receiue all the perfection it hath,
I say, therein consists the beatitude, and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. As that is one argument, to shew
the emptines of the creature,<note place="margin">It is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion.</note> that the happines of
it is without it selfe altogether, and therefore it
must needs be emptie, so this is another Reason,
which you shall finde in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.</note> Every creature,
naming divers of them, the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>waters,</hi>
and the <hi>winde,</hi> the severall <hi>generations</hi> of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whereof <hi>one goeth, and another succeedeth;</hi>
thus the <hi>Wiseman</hi> concludes, sayth he, <hi>all things
are full of labor, man cannot vtter it.</hi> And he prou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2062:75"/>
it by this, <hi>The Sunne riseth, and sets,</hi> and is never
at quiet, <hi>the Clouds goe about by their circuits,</hi> and
never remaine still in their places, <hi>the water is still
ranning</hi> to and fro, <hi>some Rivers are running to the
Sea, some running out of it, so that all things are full
of labour.</hi> Now what is the end of all motion, and
of all labour? <hi>Beloved,</hi> when any man, or any thing
moues it selfe from one place to another, it is out
of a desire, out of an appetite to be there rather
then in the place where it is, there is no appetite
or desire but of something that is wanting: for, if
it had the thing, it would haue no desire to it, and
therefore it is carried to something without it
selfe: So that the motion of the creature is a signe
of the imperfection of it. Besides, whatsoever
moues, it moveth to get that which it hath not,
yet it is in possibilitie to haue it, and it hath it not:
for, if it had it, the creature would rest there, it
would remaine in that terme, it would stand still
vpon the Center; but, because it wants somthing
it hath not, therefore it moues it selfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it labours. Now when you see this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of every Creature vnder the Sunne, we see
all things are full of labour, and sorrow, and man
that is the Lord of them (you know what is sayd
to him, that <hi>in labour he should eate his bread, and all
his life should be full of labour)</hi> it is an argument of
the imperfection, and of the vanitie &amp; indigence
of the creature, and that what it hath it must haue
elsewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Last of all; you shall know it by this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the creature hath,<note place="margin">It hath all by participation.</note> it hath it but by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2062:75"/>
it hath nothing of it selfe; as in things that
are made hot, some things are more hot, &amp; some
things lesse hot, it is an argument they haue not
hotnes in themselues, but there is something else
that is perfectly hot: for that which hath but a
part, it presupposeth that there is something else
that is the whole, of which that is but the part:
If you looke vpon all the goodnesse, excellency,
and beautie in the Creatures, you see some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
haue it more, and some lesse, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that there is something else without the
creature that hath a Sea of perfection, that is full
of goodnesse, full of excellency, as the Sunne is
full of light, and as the Sea is full of water, and
this is not within, but without the Creature.
Now the Creature being thus imperfect in it
selfe, it hath somthing communicated to it from
day to day: for if there be a continuall neede,
there is a daily supply that it must haue, and it that
fayle, or be not so good as it needs, the Creature
languisheth. This is so in every kinde: if it be in
matter of life, if meate, or drinke, or Physicke, or
ayre be wanting, the creature dayes for it: for it
hath not in it selfe, it is communicated from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And so likewise, if it be contentment, if it be
refreshing, if it be joy, without which no creature
is able to liue; if that be wanting, if <hi>God</hi> withhold
his hand, that there is not an influence into it, the
Creature languisheth according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that defect; if it be in matters that belong to
eternall life; if the <hi>Lord</hi> withhold his hand, if he
shut vp his hand, they perish eternally. And so
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2062:76"/>
we may say of all things else. So that this is the
condition of every creature, it is exceeding emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
Man himselfe is emptie, and so all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
besides are, there is no happines to be found
in them, there is no satisfaction, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to the soule of a man. If I should goe
through the particulars, you should finde it so.
If you aske, where this happinesse is to be found?
whether in riches, or in matter of estate? Surely,
it is not there:<note place="margin">Riches of two sorts.</note> for riches are but of two sorts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are naturall riches, such as meat, drinke,
and clothes; or else they are artificiall riches,
things that consist in exchange, that are invented
by art, to be the measure of them for commutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it cannot consist in the naturall; for what
serue they to but to maintain the body? and what
doth the body serue for but for the soule? and if
this were all, what should become of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
part of man, that which is indeede the man
himselfe? Besides, it cannot consist in credit, in
estimation, in honour, surely, it cannot consist in
that: for that is in the power of another, and is
not in a mans owne power, and the happinesse
and blessednesse of any thing, the contentment
which consists in the power of another, and that
in the power of the Creature, it cannot make a
man happie, it can giue little contentment to
him.</p>
               <p>Besides;<note place="margin">Honour of two sorts.</note> As we said of riches, so we may say
of honour, and glory, it is either emptie glory,
as the Scripture often cals it; That is; glory that
is gathered from vaine things, as apparrell, or
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2062:76"/>
houses, or learning, or knowledge: for there is
nothing that brings true prayse, but grace onely,
as nothing drawes shame after it properly but
sinne, it is not in this, for this is a deceivable
thing, it is a shadow that hath no substance to
answer it, or else, it is true honour and credit, and
if it be that, that is but the shadow that followes
the substance. And therefore our blessednes, our
contentednesse, and satisfaction, rests rather in
the thing from whence this credit is gathered,
then in the credit it selfe: for that is but a shadow
that sometimes followes it, and somtimes it doth
not, sometimes it is a larger shadow, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a shorter, though the body be the same.</p>
               <p>I might goe through many others,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Wiseman</hi> proveth the insufficiencie and emptines of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> but I will
rather confirme all this to you, that I haue said of
the emptines of the Creature, by that testimony
that is without all exception, That is; By the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of <hi>God</hi> himselfe, even the testimony of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">By three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. 2. where the scope of
the <hi>Wiseman</hi> is to set out this poynt, that we are

               <p>First;<note place="margin">1. Argu.</note> Sayth he, <hi>vanitie of vanities, all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
That is; There is in the Creature an excesse
of vanitie, as you know, that is the height of the
Hebrew Superlatiue, <hi>vanitie of vaniti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> Besides,
it signifieth a heape of vanities, a nest of vanities,
a wondrous exceeding great vanitie, such as he
knew not how to expresse what that vanitie is
that is in the Creature. <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is a vaine thing,
we say, that cannot profit, and therefore we see in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2062:77"/>
the 2. verse, <hi>What remaines to a man of all his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi>
or what avayles it, or what profits it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that in the Gospell, which is the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of it? Sayth our Saviour, Put the case
thou hadst all the good things in the world, that
all the glory of the world, that all the riches in the
world were in thy possession, yet, sayth he, when
thou shalt loose thy soule, what is all this? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
helpe thee to saue thy soule, <hi>what wil it profit
thee?</hi> That is; It is an unprofitable thing to make
vs happie. Besides, in this the vanitie of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is seene, that it is of a mouldring, vanishing
nature. <hi>Isa. 40. Rom.</hi> 8. those two places expresse
it:<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Isa. 40. 6. All flesh is grasse, and all the glory of it
as the flower of the grasse.</hi> That is; As it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the next Verse, as the grasse is of a fading
nature, so is the Creature it selfe, and as the
Flower of the grasse, sets out all the excellency,
all the gifts, and beautie of the Creature that is
found in it, The spirit of <hi>God</hi> blowes vpon it, and
the grasse withers, and the flower fades away:
so in <hi>Rom. 8. the Creature is subiect to vanitie.</hi>
That is; It is of no abiding condition, it withers,
and wasts, and hath nothing in it, to maintaine it.
Besides, it is called vaine: because it is not able
to bring any enterprise to passe. You would
thinke the Creature were able to doe much, but
you see what the <hi>Lord</hi> sayth; A man thinkes he is
able <hi>to build a house,</hi> or he thinkes he is able <hi>to
watch a Cittie.</hi> No; sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi> if I withdraw
my selfe, thou shalt be able to doe nothing, nor
any Creature whatsoever. What is said of that,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2062:77"/>
may be said of any thing else. A man thinkes a
Horse is a Creature that will stand him in much
steade in the day of battayle, but <hi>a horse is but a
vaine thing.</hi> And so it is of all other Creatures,
they are not able to bring any enterprise to passe,
herein is the vanitie of them.</p>
               <p>But now this is but the simple expression of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
Let vs consider (for what can we doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
since we are vpon this argument) what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> vseth to perswade vs of this
truth, that there is nothing but emptinesse in the
Creature. My <hi>Beloved,</hi> I beseech you, harken to
it: for all of vs thinke there is too much in the
Creature, we should not seeke it as we doe, our
thoughts and affections should not be so much
stirred about it as they are, if wee did not thinke
there were something in it. I say, consider the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> vseth, I will but
name the places in briefe to you, you may reade
them in these two Chapters at your leasure, it will
much helpe to bring them to your memory.
First, sayth the <hi>holy Ghost, there is nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi>
for, sayth the <hi>Wiseman,</hi> when I looke vpon
the whole universe, vpon the whole frame of
things, this I finde; first, a great instabilitie in
them, <hi>one generation commeth, and another goeth,
the Sunne riseth, and the Sunne setteth, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
constant vnder the Sunne.</hi> Now the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a man, that which will giue content to
a man, it must be some stable thing: for a man
cannot rest but vpon some Center, vpon some
place, where his soule may finde some quiet, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2062:78"/>
therefore an vnstable thing, that is in continuall
passage, is not able to giue it rest.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">2. Argu.</note> Sayth he, <hi>there is no new thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sunne:</hi> (Marke it) for, sayth he, if you goe
through the whole course of things, you shall
finde nothing new, one generation comes, and
another generation succeeds like it. And so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that as in the waues of the Sea, one followes
another, till they be all broken vpon the shore;
so it is in the succession of generations, and there
is nothing in one generation but what was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
because, sayth he, the <hi>Sunne riseth and sets,
the winds goe to and fro, they goe about by their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits.</hi>
And so <hi>the waters</hi> in the springs, and in <hi>the
Rivers,</hi> they goe and come, and there is no new
thing vnder the Sunne. What shall wee gather
from that? Why this, that there is no satisfaction
to the soule of a man. And therefore, sayth he,
<hi>the eye is not satisfied with seeing,</hi> nor <hi>the eare with
hearing.</hi> Those are the onely disciplinall senses
we haue; you know, all the knowledge you haue,
is gathered by the eye and the eare. Now if there
be no new thing vnder the Sunne, but all things
are the same; hence it is that the minde of man
when it looks about it, can finde nothing to giue
it satisfaction, for there must be some newnesse,
some varietie, something, that we haue not here,
that the soule seekes after. But, sayth he, you shall
find nothing but the same, nothing but Identitie.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> if it be objected, there is some thing now
that was not before, and there were some things
before that are not now;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:2062:78"/>The <hi>Wiseman</hi> answers thus,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> 
                  <hi>those things that
were done then, they are forgotten,</hi> they are not had
in remembrance; And <hi>so likewise the things that
are now will be forgotten.</hi> And therefore there is
no new thing. Indeede, in grace there is some
thing new, there is a new Creature, there are all
things new within and without, there is a new
Iudgement, a new Conscience, new affections,
every thing is new, <hi>all things are become new</hi> there.
Let him that hath grace, looke about him, and
there is some thing new, he comes into a new
Company, he is brought into a new world, his
eye sees things, his eare heares things that never
entred into any mans heart. That is; into any
naturall mans heart, which onely hath to doe
with naturall things, let him looke into the word
of <hi>God,</hi> there is a newnesse: for the more you
reade it, the more you desire still to reade it, the
more you heare it, still you finde some new thing
discovered: Looke on the depth of those myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
looke on the consolations of the spirit, still
there is some thing new in all the wayes of <hi>God,</hi>
that belong to the new Creature, still thou shalt
haue a fresh renewed vigor in every thing, that
satisfieth the soule of a man, and there the eye is
satisfied with seeing, and the eare with hearing.
In all the workes of Nature, there is some thing
new.</p>
               <p>The third and last reason that he vseth to shew
the emptinesse of all things under the Sunne,<note place="margin">3. Argu.</note> is,
because that which is crooked cannot be made
straight, and that which is defectiue, can none
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2062:79"/>
supply; That is; There are many things in the
Creature, that are crosse to vs, that fall thwart
vpon vs, there are many ils that we finde in our
selues, and in all the things we haue to doe with.
But, sayth he, if you looke vpon the Creature,
there is nothing that is able to <hi>make straight that
which is crooked:</hi> the daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> that
was crooked, all the Creatures both in heaven
and earth, were not able to make her straight.
A perverse and crooked minde, who can make
straight? Crooked Children, who can make them
straight? Crooked affections, inordinate feares,
and inordinate griefes, who can rectifie them?
And so, likewise, who can supply that which is
wanting? When he lookes vpon all this, and sees
it in the nature of the Creature, he concludes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all this, that <hi>all is vanitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> When he hath done all this, he goes further,
and confirmes all this by experience of his own;<note place="margin">By his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>
and now there were two things wherein <hi>Salomon</hi>
did excell, which all men would desire vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth.
That is; Greatnesse of Wisedome; And, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Greatnesse of estate; And, sayth he, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I come to the particulars, let me say this to
you concerning my experience, and see whether
the arguments that are taken from thence, be not
strong arguments to expresse the vanitie of all
things under the <hi>Sunne;</hi> Sayth he, I was a King
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a mightie man, and therefore able
to haue experience of those things that other
men had not, I had oportunities that other men
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> had not. Secondly; As I was a King, so I was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2062:79"/>
such a King as exceeded in all kinde of wealth,
and abundance of all things, as never any before,
or any that came after; so he sayth of himselfe,
and therefore he had more libertie, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
then any of the sonnes of men besides.
Moreover, he had better meanes to finde out
good and evill vnder the Sunne, because of the
largenesse of his Wisedome.</p>
               <p>Last of all, sayth he, <hi>I gaue my selfe to this, I se</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>my selfe to search and finde out,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> 
                  <hi>what is good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
to the soones of men.</hi> Now, if you would know
what <hi>Salomon</hi> found, sayth he, there are but two
things wherein this experience consists; That is;
to know what is in wisedome and folly; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to know what is in great estate.</p>
               <p>First, for matter of wisedome, he concludes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
thus,<note place="margin">Of the vanitie of wisedome.</note> 
                  <hi>he that increaseth in wisedome, increaseth
griefe.</hi> That is; Let a man goe either way, sayth
the <hi>Wiseman,</hi> (speaking of morall and civill wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not of sanctified wisedome, for that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing.) Now the question is this, among
the Creatures wherein vanitie is seene, sayth he,
<hi>he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow:</hi>
for when a man is a wise man, he findes many
defects, he sees all the miseries a-farre off that are
comming vpon him, he lookes to all the corners
of his vnhappines, which are hid from another
that is foolish. And therefore, sayth he, the more
that a man seeth, the more misery he seeth, and
the more misery he seeth, the more his griefe is
increased and multiplied. Besides, <hi>he that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
wisedome, increaseth griefe:</hi> for he sees many
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2062:80"/>
defects, he seeth many things out of order, many
things in his owne soule, many things in his own
family, many things in the Common-wealth,
many things in the Church, many things in the
course of nature, but all a mans wisedome will
not remedie it; now when a man sees ill, and is
vnable to helpe, in such a case, sayth he, <hi>he that
increaseth wisedome, increaseth griefe.</hi> Besides, if
the things themselues that are knowne, cannot
giue any filling, any contentment to the soule of
a man: certainly, the knowledge of them cannot
doe it; for the knowledge cannot goe beyond
the thing, there is more in the thing then in the
knowledge of it. But there is a vanitie, and a curse
lyes vpon all the Creatures, and therefore, he that
increaseth wisedome, takes much paines, &amp; hath
little for his labour, it costs him much paines,
much wearinesse in reading, and searching, and
when he hath done all this, as there is a vanitie in
the Creature, which is knowne; so there is in the
knowledge it selfe.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> you will say, on the other side, there is
some thing then in folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if a man be ignorant,
if a man know not that which a wiseman seeth.</p>
               <p>No;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> there is a madnesse in that, there is no
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> happines or contentment there: for such a man
multiplies griefe,<note place="margin">Of the vanitie of folly.</note> but it is of another kinde; for
evils come vpon him, and he cannot see how to
prevent them, they lye vpon him, and vndoe him
before he is a-ware, <hi>he is full of gray harres, and
knowes it not,</hi> as it is sayd of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> These are
the fruits of folly, he is precipitate, and runs into
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2062:80"/>
mischiefe, he fals into quick-sands, and hath not
eyes to discerne it, So he that increaseth folly,
on the other side, likewise, he increaseth griefe.
This, sayth <hi>Salomon,</hi> I haue found out, therefore
it is not in folly, nor in wisedome, <hi>I gaue my selfe
to know wisedome, and madnesse, and foolishnesse,</hi>
I know also, <hi>that this is vanitie and vexation of
spirit.</hi> That is; both wisedome and folly. Folly,
because it is madnesse, and Wisedome, because
it increaseth griefe.</p>
               <p>Now for the other, for the matter of his estate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
I will be very briefe in it,<note place="margin">Of the vanitie of outward things.</note> you shall finde there,
that he proues a vanitie in that, by an induction,
going through all the particulars almost that the
sonnes of men enioy vnder the Sunne. And first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
he beginnes with <hi>Laughter &amp; Iollitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Laughter.</note> that which
commonly every man seekes after, sayth he, <hi>I
thought, I would indevour my selfe to see if there
were any contentment to be found in that,</hi> but it is
not there, sayth he, <hi>I sayd of Laughter thou art mad,
and of Ioy, what is this that thou dost?</hi> These three
things he sayth concerning Iollitie, concerning
that carnall mirth, wherewith men refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>First; Sayth he, I finde it a madnesse: because
it sets a man a-worke vpon trifles, when he hath
greater things in hand, madnes, you know, is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
exulting and reioycing in vaine things,
and intending of idle things, and letting goe
things tending to our profit, as a mad man cares
for nothing belonging to his health, or his
wealth, but bestowes himselfe in picking of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2062:81"/>
flowers, or in doing some idle things, sayth he,
there is a madnes in this to consider, that in the
middest of sinne, and of danger, and in the midst
of so many great bvsinesses and imployments,
in the midst of that labour that <hi>God</hi> hath given to
the sonnes of men, for them to be full of mirth
and jollitie, this is madnes. That is one of his
censures of it.</p>
               <p>The second is, it is Folly; Folly is a stupiditie,
when stupiditie possesseth the soule of a man,
that it is not able to judge of things that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him, that is folly, so, sayth he, I found
this is jollitie and carnall mirth, it breeds stupor,
and takes away all taste and relish from me, that
as a man that tasts sweete things, is not able to
finde the relish of his Beere or Meate; so, sayth he,
when I had tasted of jollitie, and carnall mirth,
it caused me to difrelish all things: for that is the
disposition of folly, when it takes away the sense
that we should haue of other things, when it stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifieth
a man; stupiditie and folly we expresse one
by another. Last of all; What doth it? That is,
it passeth away like as musicke, there is nothing
left, it goes and leaues nothing behinde it, yea, it
leaues sadnes, if any thing, and sinne behinde it,
the thing passeth away in a moment, but the sinne
remaines, and continues, This is his censure of
that part, namely, carnall mirth and jollitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Then he comes to the rest, which I will but
name;<note place="margin">Wine.</note> 
                  <hi>Then,</hi> sayth he, <hi>I gaue my selfe to wine, to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> see if it were in that.</hi> After this, I gaue my selfe
to <hi>great workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Great workes</note> to make stately buildings, to shew
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2062:81"/>
my magnificence. After this, to get great store <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of <hi>Servants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Store of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> great possession of <hi>Sheepe,</hi> and <hi>Beeues,</hi>
&amp; to get a great retinue, to liue in much pompe.
After this, I sought all pleasant things; I made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
my selfe <hi>Paradises;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paradises, <hi>i. e.</hi> pleasant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards.</note> That is; <hi>Orchards,</hi> and <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi>
and <hi>Gardens.</hi> Likewise, I sought <hi>Singing
men, and singing women.</hi> All these things, sayth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
he,<note place="margin">Singing men, &amp;c. In those he found.</note> I sought for. And this is the verdict he giues
vpon all this, this I found.</p>
               <p>First, that in doing this, <hi>I tooke hold of folly,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
though my wisedome,<note place="margin">Folly.</note> in some measure, restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me, yet I tooke hold of folly; That is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these things, when a man is conversant
with them, they depriue him of wisedome, they
leade him on to folly; That is; They draw a man
on to sensible and outward things, to corporall
things, they abstract and withdraw his minde
from <hi>God,</hi> and from wisedome, and from spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things; this I found, sayth he, that the more
I had to doe with them, the more my wisedome
forsooke me, the more I tooke hold of folly, the
more it grew vpon me, the worse I was by med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with them, and by being conversant with
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Sayth he, I found an emptinesse in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
all;<note place="margin">Emptinesse.</note> I found them emptie Cisternes, I looked for

               <p>Thirdly; not so onely, but I found a vexation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of spirit,<note place="margin">Vexation.</note> for that which is sayd of Riches, that
they are <hi>Thornes,</hi> (they are such Thornes as doe
not onely choke the good seede, but they pricke

Thornes in them, there is vexation of spirit in
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But he addes further, fourthly, sayth he, I found
they gaue me no rest neither day nor night;<note place="margin">Restlesse care.</note> That
is; All the while I was conversant in them, I was
full of care, and trouble, and thoughts; whereas
those that are vacant from such things are at
rest, they haue rest in the night, and in the day,
but I haue none; As if he should say, he that will
be occupied in all things of this nature, he shall
finde a restlesnesse in his soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly; sayth he, I found that I had my labour
for my travaile;<note place="margin">Sore travaile.</note> this <hi>fore travaile</hi> I had, and that
was all that I had. As if he should say; I found
no comfort to answer it, I found no fruit from
them, I found certaine labour, but vncertaine
refreshments from them: This I found, that they
cost me much trouble, and paines, but when I
came to enioy the fruit of them, to receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from them, then they fayled me, then they
deceived me. Moreover, sayth he, I sound no
happinesse in them, no rest: for I was weary of
my selfe, and of my life, and of all my labours,
that I had wrought vnder the Sunne: for how
could he finde that there, which was not there?
for if <hi>God</hi> had ever sowne any happinesse in the
Creature, he might haue reaped it from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but in all these things it was never sowne:
the Creature may giue as much as is in it, but to
giue more is impossible. And therefore, sayth he,
I fought diligently to see, if there were such a
thing there, but I found it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:2062:82"/>Againe; Sayth he, moreover, when I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
all this,<note place="margin">No comfort.</note> yet I found this, that I was not able
to take comfort in it: for I saw that was the gift
of <hi>God;</hi> That is; Further than he gaue me power
to receiue any comfort from all the things that
my hand had gotten, further I could not: for,
sayth he, who hasted after outward things more
then I? the meaning is this, I indevoured, to the
vttermost of my power, to finde out content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Creature, who could doe it more,
with more diligence, who could hast after out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things more, and with more attention seeke
for all the contentments that are to be found in
the Creature then I? And yet, sayth he, I found
it was not in me, but <hi>God</hi> dispenseth that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne pleasure.</p>
               <p>The last thing of all, the last argument he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
against it,<note place="margin">We must leaue them.</note> is, he must leaue all, I must leaue it.</p>
               <p>But then comes an objection,<note place="margin">1. Ob.</note> I, but I shall
leaue it to my Sonne?</p>
               <p>True,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> sayth he, there is also a vanitie in this,
for, sayth he, first <hi>I tooke paines in equitie, and in
wisedome, and honestie, but I shall leaue it to him
that hath not taken paines for all this.</hi> As if he
should say, I shall leaue them the estate that I
haue gotten by wisedome, but I cannot leaue
them my wisedome to guide the estate when
they haue it. This, sayth he, I found in my sonne
for the present, this I saw in <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas it may be said,<note place="margin">2. Ob.</note> who knowes what
he may be?</p>
               <p>Sayth he,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> this is a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he will proue; or, put case I could know what he
would proue, who knowes what his sonne may
proue? So that all this estate that I haue gotten,
it shall not stay with them, it may be: for this is
the nature of <hi>Gods</hi> blessings (marke it) that they
abide not but vpon that Center where <hi>God</hi> hath
set them; if they come to a man that is wicked

fire, if be out of its place, water, if it be out
of its place, it is still wrastling, (though for a time
it may be kept there) till it returne to its owne
place; So it is with all those outward blessings;
It is true, evill men may haue them, and perhaps
their heires may haue them, but, if they be not
right in <hi>Gods</hi> sight, these things will roule from
them, they will not be at rest, as it were, they
will not be established there, but they will goe to
their proper Center. This he expresseth in the
last Verse, <hi>This is a vanitie</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that a man
must gather, and heape vp, to giue vnto him that is
good before God, this also is vanitie.</hi> So that, if he
had knowne what a one his sonne would haue
proved, yet he knew not what his other sonne
would haue proved, and that all his estate should
abide with him. Now, in all this, yet, sayth he,
two things I haue observed. And, <hi>Beloved,</hi> what
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> shall I say more?<note place="margin">What due is to be given and acknowledged to be in the Creature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in two things.</note> What can I say more then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
said in this poynt, to teach vs the vanitie,
and the emptines of the Creature; yet wee must
not take from the creature more then we should,
we must giue its due to it, yet, sayth he, two
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2062:83"/>
things haue I found: One is, that <hi>wisedome is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>then folly;</hi> As if he should say; Looke vpon the
whole vniverse, and see the varietie of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> with the Creatures and
the workes of the Creatures, this I finde, that
wisedome is best of all; though wisedome be a
vanitie, though it be vaine, because it cannot
helpe vs to true happines, it fals short there, yet,
sayth he, it is the best thing vnder the Sunne,
as the light is better then darknesse, and the sight
better then blindnesse: for, sayth he, wisedome
teacheth a man to direct his way, it guids a man,
when another man knowes not how to goe to
his journeyes end: wisedome teacheth a man
how to avoyde mischiefe, when a man that is in
the darke, stumbleth vpon it, and cannot see it;
That is the reason he giues; And yet, sayth he,
there is a vanitie in it, sayth he, if you looke vpon
the wisest man, and the most foolish, the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
befals them, the same sicknesse, the same
troubles, and vexation, the same death, as dyes
the one, so dyes the other; That is; for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance of their condition there is no
difference; Againe, there is a forgetfulnesse of
both, both are swept away, both passe, and are
blowne over, and they are even alike, the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as well as the foole; But, sayth he, there is
this difference, Wisedome is the best of all vaine
things vnder the Sunne.</p>
               <p>The second thing, that he hath found, is, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to enioy them, to take the comfort, the profit,
the benefit, and refreshment, that may be had
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2062:84"/>
from all the blessings of <hi>God,</hi> that he hath given
vnder the Sunne, it is a better way, and there is
lesse vanitie in it, then to heape vp still, and not
to enioy it. This I found, sayth he, that this is the
best way for a man, to take the present benefit,
this is the wisest way, so that this be remembred,
that you enioy them with weaned affections,
that you doe not so enioy them as to commit <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi>
with them: for, if you doe so, indeed then
there is a vanitie in them; for then the <hi>Lord</hi>
lookes vpon you with a jealous eye, as that he
will destroy both the things, and the man, as a
jealous man will destroy the adulterer and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse.
There is a vanitie in them then, but to
enioy them with weaned affections, this, sayth
he, I found to be the wisest thing vnder the Sun,
rather then to heape vp, and increase possessions,
and not to enioy them. This is that which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
sayth. If a man say now; But I finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and satisfaction, though <hi>Salomon</hi> found
none, I finde I haue a sweetnes in enioying plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and mirth, and a high estate: Why, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if thou doe, I will say but this to thee, it is an
argument, that thou committest <hi>Idolatry</hi> with
them, and therefore <hi>God</hi> hath made thee like to
the very things themselues. You shall finde the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> speaking of <hi>Idols,</hi> say; <hi>They haue eyes and
see not, they haue hands and handle not;</hi> and he
addes this, <hi>they that trust in them are like to them.</hi>
That is; This is the curse of <hi>God</hi> vpon those that
worship <hi>Idols,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> giues them vp to as much
stupiditie, as is in the <hi>Idols,</hi> that, they haue eyes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2062:84"/>
and see not, that they haue eares and heare not.
So, I say, when a man will so enioy these things,
that he can finde contentment in them, that he
can terminate his comfort in them; let him know
this, that is an argument, that he is made like
to them, that the curse of <hi>God</hi> is come vpon him,
or else, it may be, because thou hast not summed
vp thy accounts, thou hast not looked backe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, as <hi>Salomon</hi> did, thou hast not yet runne
through the course of them; if thou hast full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of them, and the end of them, as he
had, thou wouldst finde them <hi>vanitie, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of spirit.</hi> So much for the first, the emptines
and vanitie of the Creature.</p>
               <p>I say this,<note place="margin">2. Deduction There is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in God, as there is an emptinesse in the Creature.</note> if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> it should lead
vs vnto a further knowledge of the Creature, and
so likewise it should leade vs to a further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Almightie God.</hi> That is; To see a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fulnesse in him, I must runne briefly through
this, Labour to see him in his greatnesse, labour
to see him in all his Attributes, to see him in his
vnchangeablenes, to see him in his eternitie, in
his power, in his providence. You shall see in
<hi>Psal. 102. 21.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 102. 24.</note> what vse the <hi>Psalmist</hi> there makes
of the Attributes of <hi>God; I said O my God, take me
not away in the midst of my dayes, thy yeares indure
from generation to generation, thou hast before times
laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens
are the worke of thy hands, they shall perish, but thou
shalt indure, even they all shall waxe olde as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The meaning is this, when a man hath
proceeded to this, that he sees the vanitie of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2062:85"/>
Creatures, he lookes vpon them all, as that they
will all weare and waxe old as a Garment. A gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is new at the first, with long wearing,
you know, will be spent, and will breake into
holes, and at length be fit for nothing, but to be
cast away. So, sayth he, shall the whole body of
the Creatures be. Now, when we consider this,
that it is a mans owne case, and every Creatures,
let a man helpe himselfe with this, that <hi>God</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
and remaines for ever, and therefore, if
a man can get to be ingraffed into him, to dwell
with him, that will helpe him out of that weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and mutabilitie, and changeablenesse that
is in the Creature; and therefore in <hi>Psal. 90.</hi> sayth
he,<note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord thou art our habitation from generation to
generation.</hi> As if he should say; When a man
dwels with <hi>God,</hi> he is a safe house, a Castle, that
when generations come, and goe, &amp; times over
our heads, there is a change of all things, yet he
is a <hi>Rocke,</hi> he is a <hi>Castle,</hi> he is a <hi>Habitation,</hi> there
is no change in him; So that, when you finde
these defects in the Creature, goe home to him,
and labour to see his immutabilitie, and eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And so, likewise, when thou seest thy inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to doe any thing, when thou seest that weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the Creature, that it is not able to bring
any enterprise to passe,<note place="margin">Gods All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his providence.</note> then looke vpon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and his almightie power, in that he doth
all things that belong to him, he guides them.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Beloved,</hi> the serious setting of our selues to
consider the providence of <hi>God,</hi> and his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
power, will discover to vs his <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:2062:85"/>
more then any thing besides. In briefe, consider
this (to perswade you a little of the necessitie of
it, that you may be fully convinced of it, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular, and every common thing, must
needs be guided by him,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, proved</note> and directed by him;
I would aske but this question) First, are not all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
made by him?<note place="margin">By the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> you will grant that, that every
Creature, even the smallest, are from him, there
is no entitie but from him: Certainely, then there
is an end of it: for he made nothing but for some
end; and, if there be an end of it, he must guide
it, and leade it to the end, otherwise, he should
leaue the building imperfect, otherwise he should
but begin a worke, and leaue it in the middle, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the Creature should be lost, and perish,
and that through a default of his. But there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said to be any default, any want of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in him, in the great builder of things, and
therefore, it must needs be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat he guides every
Creature vnder the Sunne, even the smallest of
the Creatures, he guides, and directs them to
their ends. Providence is nothing else, but to
guide, governe, &amp; direct every Creature to their
severall ends, and businesses, to which he hath
appointed them. Besides, how is it that you see
things sitted one to another as they are? Is it not
the providence of <hi>God?</hi> When vousee the wheeles
of a Watch fitted one to another, when you see
the sheath fitted to the sword, you say this is some
Art, this is not by accident; Even so it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
you see a fitting of one thing to another, in
the body, in the Creatures, in every thing in all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2062:86"/>
the senses, in the Sunne with the ayre, in the eye
with the light and the colours, with the transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The fitting of one thing to another, shewes
that there is an Art that doth it,<note place="margin">The constant course of things.</note> the providence
of <hi>God.</hi> Besides, the constancy of things; we see,
they goe their course. Those things that come
by accident, that come by chance, and not by
providence, they fall out vncertainely, now one
way, and then another, but, we see, all the workes
of nature, goe in a certaine constant course.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And, lastly; Looke but vpon a house, or a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;<note place="margin">The necessitie of one gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser of things</note>
if there be not a providence, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be dissolved; there is not any family, but it will
be so; and therefore, there is a neede of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
also in the great family of the world: and
if there be a government, it must needs be by
him: for by man it cannot be governed: for the
preservation of every thing is in the vnitie of it,
and therefore, you see, any thing that is divided,
that is the dissolution of it, as when the soule is
divided from the body, and when the body is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from it selfe; So, likewise, in a family, or
in a Common-wealth, when it is divided,
looke how farre it goes from vnitie, so neere it
comes to perishing, and the more peace, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
the more safetie. Now, if there were not
one guider of all these, if there should be many
guiders, there would be different streames, there
would be divers well-heads, and if there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
principles of things, that swerue this way,
and that way, there would be a division in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2062:86"/>
nature of things, there would not be a vnitie, and
by consequence, it would be the destruction of
them. And therefore, of necessitie, first there
must be a government, or else how could the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
stand; and if there be a government, it
must not be by man; and if it be not by man, it
must be by one that is <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the objections in briefe;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> we see many
things are casuall, and you may strengthen the
objection out of <hi>Eccles. 9.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>I see</hi> (sayth he)
<hi>that the race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the
strong, nor yet riches to a man of vnderstanding,
but time, and chance befals every thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> I answer, in a word, that it is true,
there are chances that fall out in all these things,
that we call properly casuall, or accidentall, when
some thing comes betweene a cause, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and hinders it. As when a man is going a
journey, and an Axe-head fall off, and either
wounds him, or kils him, it comes betweene the
effect, and the cause, betweene his doing, and
that which he intended; if the fire be burning,
and water cast vpon it, and hinders it, that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall,
because it takes off the cause from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
So it is in this, wherein the <hi>Wiseman</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth,
when a man is strong, and some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
comes betweene, and hinders him from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the battaile, when a man hath wisedome,
and some accident comes betweene, and hinders
him from obtaining favour; This is that which
we properly call chance. Now it is true, there is
such a chance in the nature of the thing, but yet,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2062:87"/>
consider this, though this chance be contrary to
the particular causes, yet it hath a cause, and it
riseth from the vniversall cause; so that it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
chance; because it thwarts, and comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the intention of the particular cause, but
it doth not differ from the intention of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall:
for those accidentall things haue a cause,
as well as the things that we intend, haue a cause:
somewhat there is that is the author of all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that is the first of all causes, and therefore it
is impossible, that any thing should be totally by
accident. And therefore, I say, whensoever you
finde this, it is so farre from being casuall, if you
looke into it exactly, that then the providence of
<hi>God</hi> is most seene in it of al others, so far is it from
comming by chance; because those things that
are done by particular causes, according to their
intention, we vsually ascribe it to them, but when
there is an intercurrent action comes, that we
call chance, that belongs to the vniversall cause,
and is to be ascribed to him, and hence it is, that
the <hi>Lord</hi> vsually in the dispensing and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
of contingent things, he turnes things ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by accidentall causes, by casuall things, then
by those causes that haue influence into their
effects; because his owne hand is most seene in
it, he gets the greatest glory by it, when he turnes
greatest matters by a small accident, as we turne
a great Ship by a little Rudder, therein his power
and his glory is seene. And therefore, I say, when
you see such a vanitie in the Creatures, labour to
see the more fulnes in <hi>God;</hi> if there be such an
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2062:87"/>
emptines, such a mutabilitie, such an instabilitie
in the Creature, looke vpon his immutabilitie,
and his eternitie, and labour to be partakers of it.
When you see such an inabilitie in the Creature,
to bring its enterprises to passe, labour to see his
almightie providence, and to be perswaded of it,
to think with thy selfe, there is not the least thing
without this, there is not the least Creature that
makes a motion, this way, or that way, but as it
is guided and directed by him.</p>
               <p>I would willingly adde but this one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the tryall, when we haue said so much of
the <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of the emptines of
the Creature,<note place="margin">Examination, or Tryals of our beliefe of Gods All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie.</note> All the question is now how farre
we practice this: Let every man examine his
owne heart, and aske himselfe these questions.</p>
               <p>First, if a man beleeue that <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> that
is in <hi>God,</hi> why doth he terminate his affections <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in the Creature? If there be nothing in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but emptines, why doe you loue the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
why doe you feare the Creature? why doe
you reioyce in the Creature immediately as you
doe? <hi>Beloved,</hi> if there be nothing in that, but all
be in him, we should see through the Creature,
we should looke beyond it. It is that which is
said of <hi>Shisack, 2 Chron. 12.</hi> he was but the <hi>viall,</hi>
through which <hi>Gods</hi> wrath was powred vpon <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell;</hi>
so it was true of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he was but the <hi>viall,</hi>
through which <hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse was powred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Israell.</hi> If you did looke vpon every man, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every friend, and every enemy, vpon every
Creature, he is an instrument of good, or hurt to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2062:88"/>
you, but as an emptie <hi>viall</hi> in it selfe, through
which <hi>God</hi> powres either his goodnes, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or else his wrath, it would cause you not to
sticke vpon the Creature, not to wrangle with
men, not to hate men, or to be angry with them:
for that is but the <hi>viall:</hi> It would cause you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
not to be proud of the friendship of men,
not to be secure in them, not to trust in them,
not to thinke your selues safe in them: for they
are but <hi>vials,</hi> through which <hi>God</hi> powres his
mercy, and goodnesse towards you. Consider
whether you be able to doe this. Looke on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
when <hi>Naball</hi> sent him a rough answer, an
vntoward answer, he was exceedingly moved at
it: When <hi>Shemei</hi> did the same, yea, and to his
face, in a farre greater measure, he was not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
what was the reason of it, but, because when
he looked to <hi>Naball,</hi> he forgat <hi>God,</hi> he saw not
<hi>God</hi> setting <hi>Naball</hi> a-worke to giue such an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
he looked not to <hi>Naball</hi> as a <hi>viall,</hi> but as if
he had beene the principall in the action in hand,
and therefore he was ready to fly vpon him with
impatience (as you know how angry he was with
him) but when <hi>Shemei</hi> did curse him, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he thought, to be quiet, and not in the other
case: because he looked on <hi>Shemei</hi> as a <hi>viall:
God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>hath bid him doe it,</hi> and therefore
he goes to <hi>God,</hi> and not to <hi>Shemei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi> if you doe beleeue this <hi>All-sufficiency</hi>
in <hi>God,</hi> and this emptines in the Creature, why
are you not able to doe this, not to loue the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not to terminate I say, your affections in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2062:88"/>
them, but <hi>to vse this world as though you vsed it
not.</hi> That is; All the things in the world, all the
men in the world? for indeede you would vse
them, as if you did not vse them, if you did see
an emptines in them, and a fulnes and an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; If we doe beleeue there is an <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in <hi>God,</hi> why doe we goe out from him
to take in present commodities, to avoyde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
dangers? Why doe we not serue him with
the losse of all these? For if he be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
it is no matter what thou loosest, thou hast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
if thou hast him. You may see it in <hi>Paul</hi>
(to resemble it to you, to shew you what I would
haue said) sayth he, we <hi>serue the living God,</hi> we
take much paines in our Ministery, we suffer
much, but haue nothing but imprisonment, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fastings, and whippings, and stonings;
and why doe we it? <hi>for we trust in the living God,</hi>
and we thinke him to be <hi>All-sufficient:</hi> when he
sayth, we trust in him, that is implyed. I say, now
looke to thy selfe, art thou able to serue him,
without looking to present commoditie? Art
thou able to doe as they did, when they were
sent emptie, and yet were willing to doe the
worke, and were content to haue no wages gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, because they trusted in <hi>God,</hi> &amp; thought
he was sufficient? you see, our Saviour put them
vpon it; it is true, they lacked nothing, but yet
that was the tryall. <hi>Moses,</hi> when he might haue
had present commoditie, he left all, he left the
Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he left <hi>Egypt,</hi> and went emptie
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2062:89"/>
away, he did not turne aside to these present
Commodities, why? because he thought the
<hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> And so <hi>Abraham,</hi> he left
his Fathers house, and came into a Land, where
he had not a foote; because he thought <hi>God</hi> was
<hi>All-sufficient; God</hi> speakes to him, vpon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
<hi>feare not Abraham,</hi> thou art in a strange
Countrey, where thou hast no body to provide
for thee, yet <hi>I will be All-sufficient.</hi> Those that
<hi>wandered vp and downe in sheepes-skinnes, and in
Goats-skinnes;</hi> no question, they might haue had
outward comforts aswell as others, if they would
haue tooke that course that others did, but they
were willing to leaue all present commodities:
because they trusted in <hi>God,</hi> that he was <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
They suffered</hi> (sayth the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.)
<hi>the spoyling of their goods,</hi> they lost all, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
vp, and downe, and had nothing but <hi>dens</hi>
to lye in, in stead of houses, and <hi>sheepe-skinnes,</hi> in
stead of cloathes. This they did, because they
thought him to be <hi>All-sufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, Consider whether thou be able to doe
this, to let goe present wages, present comforts,
and commodities, &amp; not to turne aside to them:
for, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> what neede is there
of them? If there be enough in him, why should
you step out to them? Moreover, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
why doe we sticke so much vpon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
meanes, to say, if such meanes be not vsed,
I shall be vndone, if he be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> it is no
matter what the meanes be, he is able to bring
it to passe. It is vsuall with men to say, if such a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2062:89"/>
thing sayle me, I am vndone, and if such an evill
be not removed. What are these but particulars?
this sticking vpon particulars is a signe we thinke
him not <hi>All-sufficient. Isa. 60. 10.</hi> See what an
expression there is for matter of meanes, <hi>He that
walkes in darkenesse, and sees no light, let him trust
in the Lord God;</hi> he that walkes in darknesse, and
hath no light, yet, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> put the
case, there be no meanes at all, put the case there
be vtter emptines, that there be not a sparke of
light, but that thou walkest in darknesse and seest
nothing to helpe thee, if he be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
trust in him, let him that hath no light, but walkes
in darkenesse, trust in the <hi>Lord:</hi> for he is then able
to helpe him.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we thinke him to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
when we loose any particular means, it is but the
scattering of a beame, it is but the breaking of a
Bucket, when the Sunne and the fountaine is the
same. Why should we be troubled at it? If we
did thinke him to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> when one
meanes is broken, cannot he finde out another,
if he be <hi>All-sufficient?</hi> When he said to <hi>Paul,</hi> that
all the soules with him should be safe, you see,
there were divers meanes, all were not able to
swim to the shore, and the Ship was not able to
bring them to shore, but yet, by broken boards,
and by one meanes, and another, all got to the
shore; So the <hi>Lord</hi> brings things to passe in a
strange manner, sometimes one way, sometimes
another, he breakes in peeces many times the
Ship, that, we thinke, should bring vs to shore,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2062:90"/>
but casts vs on such boards as we did not expect;
so he doth in the meanes both good and evill,
somewhat comes in, and brings vs helpe that we
never thought of. An enemy comes in and doth
vs hurt, that we never dreamed of, and those,
that we had our eye fixed vpon, it may be, doe
neither of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And so likewise, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> if he
be thus exceeding great, consider, if thou see
thine owne vilenesse, thy ignorance, thy empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in comparison of him. When <hi>Agur</hi> looked
vpon <hi>God,</hi> and saw his greatnes, <hi>Pro. 30.</hi> he cryes
out, that <hi>he had not the vnderstanding of a man in
him.</hi> When <hi>Iob</hi> saw him in his greatnes, <hi>he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe in dust, and ashes,</hi> he had <hi>spoken once,
and twice, but he would speake no more.</hi> And so <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
when <hi>God</hi> appeared to him, sayd, <hi>I am
but dust, and ashes;</hi> whether art thou able to say
thus when thou lookest vpon <hi>God</hi> in his greatnes?
First, art thou able to say, <hi>I haue not the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of a man in me;</hi> That is; Canst thou see
the emptinesse, and vanitie of thy owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
Canst thou learne not to murmur against
<hi>God,</hi> in any of his wayes? Canst thou learne to
captivate, and bring vnder thy thoughts to the
wayes of <hi>Gods</hi> providence? Canst thou doe, as
<hi>Iob</hi> did, saying, I haue heretofore taken excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and murmured, and was discontented, and
wondered at the wayes of <hi>God,</hi> and the workes of
his hands, I haue done this once, or twice, but
now I will doe so no more? <hi>Iob</hi> knew <hi>God</hi> as well
as we know him, but when <hi>God</hi> spake out of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2062:90"/>
                  <hi>whirle-winde,</hi> and made knowne his greatnes to
him, this was the fruit of it to <hi>Iob,</hi> though he had
spoken once, or twice, that is, before that time,
yet now he would doe it no more. Canst thou
be content to see the <hi>Lord</hi> going all the wayes
that he doth, setting vp evill men, and putting
downe good men, causing the Churches to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the enemies to prosper? Canst thou see
all this, and yet <hi>sanctifie him in thine heart.</hi> Art
thou able to say, that <hi>he is holy in all his wayes,</hi>
and in this to see the greatnesse of <hi>God,</hi> and thy
owne folly and weakenes? Canst thou say, that
<hi>thou art but dust, and ashes,</hi> and to say it in good
earnest? Canst thou looke on thy selfe as on a vile
Creature, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, saying, <hi>Goe from me: for
I am a sinfull man?</hi> Then I will beleeue, that thou
hast seene <hi>God</hi> in his greatnes, I will beleeue that
thou hast seene him in his <hi>All-sufficiency,</hi> that he
hath represented himselfe by his spirit into thy
soule, in some measure, when thou seest these
effects in thy soule, when thou seest thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and thy vilenes, when thou seest what an
emptie Creature thou art, sure this is another
thing, by which thou mayst judge, whether thou
hast experience, whether thou hast practised this
doctrine, that we haue delivered of the <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> and of the emptines of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> why are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
we then so readie to knock at other mens dores?
Why are we then so readie to goe to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to seeke helpe, and comfort, and counsell
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2062:91"/>
from it, and to knocke so little at his doore by
prayer, and seeking to him? for, if he be <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
thou shouldst be abundant in prayer, thou
wouldst take little time to looke to others, thy
chiefe busines would be to looke to him, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in praying to him, but in serving him, and
pleasing him: We knocke at his doore as well by
the duties of obedience, as by prayer, and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him; if thou thinkest him to be <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
why dost thou not doe this?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Againe, if thou thinke him to be <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
why art thou not content to be at his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
finding? Put the case, he deprive thee of all
things else, and doe with thee, as Parents doe
with their Children, who giue them not a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their purse, but tell them they will provide
for them, why art thou not content that <hi>God</hi>
should doe so? What, if he strip thee of all thy
wealth, of thy libertie, of thy friends, so that thou
canst looke for nothing but immediately at his
hands, to feede thee as he feeds the <hi>Ravens,</hi> and
the <hi>Lyons;</hi> if he be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> why dost thou
not trust in him, in such a case, and rest vpon
him?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Againe, lastly, if thou thinkest <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
why dost thou not when thou hast any
service, or dutie to doe, either belonging to <hi>God,</hi>
or man, why dost thou not resolue vpon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, without looking to the consequence
whatsoever it be? For, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> if he be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
then all our care should be nothing but
to doe our dutie, and to leaue the successe to him.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2062:91"/>
A servant that thinkes his Maister is able, and
willing to giue him wages, and provide for him
sufficiently at the end of the day, or the yeare,
or the end of his service, he will be carefull to
doe his worke, without looking to his wages,
without making provision for himselfe, and so,
if thou beleeue <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> thou wilt
seeke no more but to finde out what thy dutie is,
what rule thou oughtest to walke by, what service
thou owest to man in such a case, how to keepe
a good conscience in such a businesse, in such a
straight, in such a difficultie, thou wilt set thy
wits a-worke to finde out this, but when thy wit
is over-running thy dutie, and thou lookest to
the consequence (if I doe this and this, this will
befall me) that is a signe thou thinkest not <hi>God</hi> to
be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> thou thinkest thy Maister can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
provide for thee, but thou thinkest I shall be
poore, when I haue done his service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will provide for my selfe, I shall want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
I shall haue enemies come in vpon me; if
thy Maister be a <hi>Sunne,</hi> a <hi>Shield,</hi> and a <hi>Buckler,</hi>
and <hi>an exceeding great reward,</hi> and thou beleevest
him to be so, thou wouldst finde out onely thy
dutie, and it is no matter what the consequence
is; So you see the three men did, <hi>we haue resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that we will not worship thine Image,</hi> and
whereas you tell vs of casting vs into a burning
fiery Fornace, that we care not for, <hi>God is able to
deliver vs,</hi> they did see <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> and
therefore they did the dutie. Certainely, <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
in any difficult case, no man will doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2062:92"/>
except he be perswaded that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;</hi>
Those three men would never haue refused
to worship the Idoll, except they could haue
said, and thought in their hearts, <hi>God is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
vs out of thy hands, O King.</hi> This they sayd,
and resolved to doe. And so <hi>Daniell</hi> resolved to
doe his dutie, and not to goe a steppe out of the
path, besides the Rule; Well; he shall be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Lyons denne;</hi> yet he keepes his resolution
firme; it was enough for him to doe his dutie,
for the consequence of it, he left it to <hi>God:</hi> for he
knew he was <hi>All-sufficient.</hi> You see, <hi>God</hi> watched
over them, and delivered them all. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in refusing to eate of the <hi>Kings</hi> meate, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi>
would not pollute himselfe, it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for him being a <hi>Iew,</hi> it might haue cost him
life, for ought he knew, if he had looked on the
his consequence, but he resolved to doe it: Sayth
the Text, <hi>he resolved in his heart to doe it,</hi> &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to <hi>God.</hi> And we see in all these three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>God</hi> shewed himselfe sufficient: So he doth,
when we looke to our dutie sincerely, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
when we doe it, and looke not to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
he is then <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and will shew
himselfe to be so. And the like we see in the case
of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> he thought it was a sinne to bow to
<hi>Hamman,</hi> who was an <hi>Amalekite,</hi> he would not
doe it; Well, but they shall all be destroyed, he,
and all the <hi>Iewes;</hi> He tels <hi>Hester</hi> confidently, the
Church should be delivered, but he knew not
how, but, sayth he, if it be not by thy hands, thou
shalt fare the worse for it, but certainly, sayth he,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2062:92"/>
                  <hi>deliverance shall come</hi> to the Church, one way,
or other, <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All-sufficient;</hi> Herevpon she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth,
saying in effect, whatsoever be the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
I will doe it, it is my dutie. And, you
know, <hi>God</hi> shewed himselfe <hi>All-sufficient</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
her, and him, and all the people of the
<hi>Iewes:</hi> So, I say, if thou wouldst finde out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy heart beleeue all this, that is delivered,
whether thou doe practise it, or no; Consider,
if thou canst doe it now or no: Consider, what
thy dutie is vpon every occasion, &amp; never looke
to the consequence, either to the losse of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of riches, or favour: for <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
he can bring it in. Be it againe, on the other
side, such crosses, and losses are like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vpon it, yet he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
so that thou dost it more or

               <p>Which words containe the
Covenant on <hi>Gods</hi> part, <hi>I will
be All-sufficient,</hi> which here is
expressed in the generall, but in other places more
particularly, as I shewed you then when we hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the words:</p>
               <p>The other part of the words containeth the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> or condition required on our part;
<hi>Walke before me, and be thou perfect. God</hi> will be <hi>All-sufficient</hi> vnto vs, that is his promise, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of vs, that we should be <hi>perfect</hi> with him,
he will be <hi>All-sufficient</hi> to them that depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>So the maine point that we haue to handle, is

which we haue no interest in his <hi>Covenant,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> but before I come
to handle this poynt, which is the maine, I will
touch an observation or two by the way.</p>
               <p>And first from the Connexion, <hi>I am God All-sufficient;
therefore walke before me, and be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
(I will but touch it, because I handled the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue

               <p>You see, that is made the ground of our <hi>perfect
walking with God,</hi> that we beleeue him to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
and therefore, I say, as our perswasion
of that is more or lesse, so every man more or lesse
is <hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> That is; Looke how a mans

               <p>The reason of which is,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> partly, because it is

and vnevennesse, which is selfe-loue.
The reason why men walke not constantly, and
perfectly with <hi>God,</hi> is because they loue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
inordinately, they thinke to provide better
for themselues: when a man is fully perswaded of
<hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> it answers all those false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,
all those deceitfull arguments that selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue
is readie to bring to vs, vpon every occasion;
there is no man departs from <hi>God,</hi> but he thinkes,
at that time, it is better for him so to doe: when it
shall be answered him, <hi>God is All-sufficient,</hi> it is
better for thee to keepe in the straite way, if thou
seeke thy selfe, by disobeying of him, it shall be
worse for thee, let all the false reasonings of selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue
be answered, and the heart must needs be
<hi>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vse of it,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> in briefe, is that we should labour
to be perswaded of this truth,<note place="margin">To labour for this perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and apply it to
make vse of it, vpon every occasion: when any
command is presented vnto vs, when any thing
is to be done, run to this principle, to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> that shall helpe thee
to doe every dutie, that shall preserue thee from
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2062:94"/>
every sinne: for example, <hi>God</hi> hath commanded
vs to <hi>deny our selues</hi> in our profit, in our credit,
and our pleasures; and many times it comes that
we are to performe this dutie in particular cases,
consider seriously then of the strength of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that <hi>God is All-sufficient;</hi> it will make thee
able to doe the dutie throughly. What though
thou be a looser in thy credit? if <hi>God be All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
he is able to make it vp. What though thou
be a looser in thy profit, as <hi>Amaziah</hi> was? is not
he able to giue thee fourescore talents, sayth the
Prophet to him? What though thou be a looser
in thy pleasures, that thou loose, or want <hi>the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of sinne for a season;</hi> is not he able to make it
vp with <hi>peace of conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost?</hi>
And so againe; We are commanded to <hi>take vp
our daily crosse,</hi> and not to take base &amp; sinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to avoyd crosses, and troubles, and affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctions,
when we meete with them in right and straight
wayes, and surely, the way to performe this dutie
is to be perswaded of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> let a
man thinke that <hi>God</hi> is able to defend and carry
him out, that he is able to keepe him in the time
of those sufferings, that it is he that keepes the
keyes of the prison doore, that opens, and shuts,
when he pleaseth, it is he that makes whole, and
makes sicke; <hi>the issues of life and death, belong to
him: Every mans iudgement,</hi> though <hi>he seeke the

inable a man to beare any crosse, to passe through
all varietie of conditions, and not to divert from
a straight way, but to goe through the storme
when he meets with it.</p>
               <p>And so we may say of every other dutie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
the duties of our particular callings, not for
our owne good, but for the good of others: <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
this is a speciall thing, men loose their liues,
they loose that blessed opportunitie they haue to
grow <hi>rich in good workes,</hi> that when every day they
might adde much to their treasure, to their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
against the day of Iudgement, whilest they
serue themselues, and seeke themselues altogether,
it is but time lost. Now, I say, what is the reason
that men in the exercise of their callings haue such
an eye to their owne profit, and not to the profit
of others, whom they deale with, that they haue
such an eye to their owne credit, and advantage,
and not to others good? it is because they thinke
they must be carefull to provide for their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,
to looke to themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they haue no bodie
else to doe it: let a man be perswaded that <hi>God</hi>
takes care for him, that riches are as the shadow
that followes the substance of a mans <hi>perfect</hi> ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with <hi>God,</hi> that it is he that giues them, it is he
that dispenseth them, it is he that giues the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the wages belongs to him, the care of the
worke onely belongs to vs; if a man would <hi>deny
himselfe,</hi> and be a looser many times in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
be content to doe many things for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of others, to vse those talents that <hi>God</hi> that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, not for his owne, but for his Maisters
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2062:95"/>
advantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I say, if he would doe this, he should
finde <hi>God All-sufficient,</hi> and the perswasion of his
<hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> is that that strengthens a man, and
makes him constant in the performance of it.
I might giue you the like instances, but I will not
run any further. But this you may take for a sure
rule, there is never any dutie that shall cost a man
any perill, that shall cost him any labour, any losse
that a man will be willing to doe, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> he never doth it
without this perswasion, he never fayles in it but
as farre as he fayles in the beliefe of this. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was put on the hardest taske,
to leaue his <hi>Countrey, and his Fathres house,</hi> he was
perswaded that <hi>God</hi> would be with him, &amp; would
blesse him: for <hi>God</hi> had made him a promise to doe
it, it was easie then to performe it, but afterwards,
when he began to shrinke, and to doubt of this,
that <hi>God</hi> might fayle him, that he would not be
<hi>God All-sufficient</hi> to him, as when he went downe
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he denied <hi>Sarah</hi> to be his wife, what
was the cause of this sinne? but because he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
the <hi>God</hi> could not defend him. And so <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
how many hard taskes went he through,
with all chearefulnesse, and constancie? but when
he began to fayle of this perswasion, that <hi>God</hi> was
able to deliver him from <hi>Saul,</hi> and to bring him
into the Kingdome, then he beginnes to step out
from that dutie, and way of obedience, that he
should haue walked in, to flie to <hi>Achis,</hi> &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the way, I say, to make our hearts <hi>perfect</hi> with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2062:96"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> is to increase this perswasion of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie.</hi>
Now this we should doe especially at
these times, when we are to receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for what is the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but the seale of
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> on both parts? It is the seale of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> on <hi>Gods</hi> part, he promiseth to be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
and the Sacrament seales this to you;
when it is said to you, <hi>take, and eate, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi>
the meaning is this, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and <hi>God</hi> the Father giues him, and sayth,
take him; That is; Take <hi>Christ,</hi> with all his: it is
certaine, he is a husband, that is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
he is a field that is full of treasure, and so you must
thinke with your selues, when you come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Sacrament, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himselfe, is
given to you; That is; <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> with all his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and treasure, with all his benefits, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.
Now, when you haue taken <hi>Christ,</hi> as it
is a free gift, then consider all those particular
benefits, labour to dig that field, and to see all the
varietie of treasures in it, you shall finde that there
is nothing that you can desire, but you shall finde
it in him, you shall finde an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in him,
both for this life, and for the life to come.</p>
               <p>Againe; As this is the <hi>Covenant,</hi> on <hi>Gods</hi> part,
that is sealed to vs in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> so you must
remember, that you put to your seale likewise,
to confirme the condition of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> on
your part: for so you haue promised, there is a sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,
an engagement, remember that you
keepe <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Condition with him, (for
it is reciprocall): for all Covenants must be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2062:96"/>
mutuall, they must be betweene two parties, and
remember, that <hi>thou put thy seale to it,</hi> that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
with <hi>God</hi> the Covenant, that thou hast made
to <hi>walke before him perfectly.</hi> Now, the end of the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> is to remember this, <hi>doe this,</hi> sayth
<hi>Christ, in remembrance of me;</hi> as if he should say;
you will be ever and anon readie to forget this
<hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another point I desire to obserue, before I
come to handle the maine, is from these words,
<hi>walke before me, &amp;c.</hi> it is a metaphor I finde very
frequently vsed in Scriptures, and therefore we
will not passe it over, <hi>walke before me, and be thou
perfect.</hi> Whence we will therefore obserue, that
<q>There is a great similitude betweene a Christians
life,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and walking from place to place.<note place="margin">A Christian life like a walke.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I finde not any metaphor in the Scriptures vsed
more frequently, and therefore it should teach vs
some thing: for a metaphor, you know, is but a
similitude that is contracted to one word, it is a
short similitude, folded vp in a word, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
is to be taught vs, some resemblance there is
that we will labour to expresse, and make some
short vse of it.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Lord</hi> saith to <hi>Abraham, I am All-sufficient;</hi>
therefore <hi>walke perfectly before me,</hi> it is
as if he had said, <hi>Abraham,</hi> I meane to be a good
Maister to thee, I meane to giue thee sufficient
wages, thou shalt want nothing thou needest;
now be thou carefull to doe thy worke, be not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2062:97"/>
sit not still, but be working (for that is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by <hi>walking</hi>) to <hi>walke</hi> is still to be acting in
some thing, still to be working, to be in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not sit still, so that this is intimated to
vs, when he sayth, <hi>walke before me,</hi> that the whole
course of this life is like a Iourney from one place
to another. And againe, every particular action,
is like so may steps taken to that Iourneys end,
and (marke it, I say) looke what the rounds are
in a Ladder, that goe from the bottom to the top,
looke what the paces in a Iourney are, so many
paces goe to make vp the Iourney, so doth every
particular act go to make vp that Christian course
that every man is to fulfill: so then, as every step
a man takes, tends to some scope, or other, either
East, or West, or North, or South, in generall and
in particular, to some particular place, neare some
Cittie, some Towne, or some Roome, so every
action in a mans life, it either tends in generall to
East, or West, that is; to good or evill, it tends to
the service of <hi>God,</hi> or to the service of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and,
likewise, in particular, it tends either to this good
dutie, or to avoyde this particular sinne, to this or
that particular service of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Sathan,</hi> or of our
selues, every action we doe.</p>
               <p>So that not onely the greater actions (marke it)
but even the lesser, every one of them, it is like a
pace in a Iourney, which that I may make plaine
to you, you must know, that all the actions we do,
either be actions that belong to our generall, or
to our particular calling, or such as fit vs to them.
Now take the lowest and the meanest action,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2062:97"/>
your eating and drinking, your sleepe and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they all are steps that tend to this Iourney,
that tend to this scope, they are steppes, every one
of them is a step nearer to <hi>God,</hi> and to heaven, if
they be rightly vsed; and from him, if they be not
vsed as they ought. <hi>Whether you eate or drinke, or
whatsoever you doe, doe it to the glory of God.</hi> Wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
ever you doe, marke that supreame scope, so that
all actions tend to one or other of these; now you
make no question, but even those co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon actions
are steppes that lead to the Iourney, even as you
see, take a servant that is set to worke, or to goe a
Iourney, that is to mowe, or to driue a Cart, even
the whetting of the sithe, is a part of his worke, as
well as his mowing of the grasse, the provendring
of his horse, is a dispatching of his Iourney, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on in it, as well as when he rides, and so the
oyling of the wheele, is a drawing on, as well as
every steppe he takes: so, I say, it is in these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
actions, that we make lesse account of, our
sleeping, our eating, our drinking, our recreation,
every one of them, is a steppe in the Iourney.
I speake it for this end, that we may not neglect
any action, that we may not despise the least of
our actions: for there is not one of them, but it is
a pace, or a steppe: so that this you must make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of; every day you finish a great part of your
space: for you doe many actions, and looke what
actions you doe, see what they be, examine them
at night: for every actions is a step, and either you
step towards <hi>God</hi> in it, or you step from him; either
you step towards heaven, or towards hell: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2062:98"/>
looke to every action. But this is in generall.</p>
               <p>Now in particular (to bring this similitude a
little nearer) you must consider in a <hi>walke</hi> from
one place to another, when you goe in a Iourney,
you haue these particulars.</p>
               <p>First; There must be a place, a terme to which
you walke, some whither, whither a man goes.</p>
               <p>Againe; There must be a place, or terme from
which a man comes.</p>
               <p>Againe; There is a distance: for in a point, or
a little space a man cannot walke.</p>
               <p>Againe; There must be a ground to walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And there must be a path: for in particular
Iourneys, as from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> there is a
straight path-way to walke to it, &amp;c. These parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
we will expresse to you in this course of a
Christian life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First; I say, there must be a place to which a man
goes,<note place="margin">That which he goes to.</note> 
                  <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> as we call it, and that is to
grace, we travaile to <hi>grace,</hi> we travaile to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and glory of <hi>God,</hi> and we travaile to <hi>salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
these I finde in the Scripture to be the ends,
and the aymes, and the scope, and marke, at which
every man is to looke in his Iourney, in the course
of his life: Labour to <hi>grow in grace,</hi> which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
vs to serue <hi>God,</hi> without which we can doe
nothing: Labour also, when you haue it to come
to the fruits, and operations, and effects of it;
that is, to spend your time in doing some thing
that may tend to <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and service. And last
of all, looke at the reward, looke at <hi>salvation,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:2062:98"/>
which is the end of that Iourney, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the two former, that the end is <hi>grace,</hi> and
<hi>righteousnes;</hi> there is more question of the latter,
whether a man may make salvation, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of reward, an end, a marke, and scope,
to which he travailes: but all these are our ends
you shall see <hi>Act. 26. 18. Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> is sent to preach to
the people; and this is the scope of his preaching,
he was sent <hi>to open their eyes, that they might turne
from darknes to light, from the power of Sathan to
God, that they might receiue the forgiuenes of sinnes,
and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by
faith in Christ.</hi> Marke it, that they may turne from
darknes to light, there you see the scope is <hi>light;</hi>
because, without <hi>light,</hi> a man cannot see his way,
<hi>Grace</hi> helpes a man in his Iourney, as light doth:
the next thing is, <hi>from the power of Sathan vnto
God;</hi> That is; from living in bondage to <hi>Sathan,</hi>
to serue <hi>God,</hi> to doe that which stands to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and advancement, and then lastly, <hi>that they
may receiue forgiuenes, and inheritance amongst them
that are sanctified by faith in me;</hi> there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
for a mans ayme is likewise that he might
receiue the inheritance, that he might be saved,
and haue heaven in the end. So likewise you finde
it expressed <hi>Philip. 3. 14. Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 14.</note> sayth he, <hi>pressed
hard toward the marke,</hi> for what purpose? for <hi>the
price of the high calling of God in Christ,</hi> there you
see that the ayme that <hi>Paul</hi> had in following hard
to the marke, you see there was a marke that he
aymed at, and that he had expressed before <hi>to be
found in the righteousnesse that is in Christ,</hi> and,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2062:99"/>
sayth he, that <hi>I might obtaine the price of the high
calling,</hi> the price (that is) the wages; as a man
that runs a race, there is a price propounded to
him, and when he hath finished the race, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
it, sayth he, this is one of my ends to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the price:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> so it is said of <hi>Moses, Heb. 11. he
had respect to the recompence of reward.</hi> So, my <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi>
in the journey you must make this account,
you travaile towards <hi>grace,</hi> that is the scope that
you ayme at, againe, your end is to serue <hi>God,</hi> to
seeke his glory, that all your actions may tend to
it, and lastly, that you might be saved, that you
might haue the inheritance with the Saints.</p>
               <p>Now the terme from which we travaile is from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                  </gap>d our selues,
and likewise it is from <hi>damnation;</hi> so that you shall
finde this difference in it, that all men, though
they haue but one Iourneys end, yet there are
different places, from which euery of them travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
according to the different sinnes, to which
they are inclined, some men had need to travaile
from covetousnes, some men againe, from prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie,
these seeme to goe contrary wayes, yet
both ayme at the same Iourneys end, as two men
that intend to come to <hi>London,</hi> one comes out of
<hi>Kent,</hi> another comes out of the <hi>North,</hi> these men
seeme to goe contrary, one goes <hi>North,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>South,</hi> yet both agree in their Iourneys end;
so it is in this travaile, some men are subiect to be
timorous, and discouraged, and cowardly in their
actions, some men againe to be rash, and bold,
these men haue contrary courses, yet they both
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2062:99"/>
travaile to the same mediocrity, to the same <hi>grace,</hi>
to the same way of righteousnesse: so, I say, the
termes from which we come are exceeding diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
though the Iourneys end be the same to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man. Looke what the severall inclinations
of men are, even therein to part from himselfe, to
<hi>deny himselfe,</hi> to resist his personall, and particular
lusts, that is the terme, from which he is to goe:
and so likewise it is to be considered, that we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
from damnation, that every steppe that a
man takes in the way of righteousnesse, it is so
many steppes <hi>from death to life,</hi> he is so much nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
his Iourneys end: for <hi>salvation is now neerer

looke as you travaile faster in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
so your reward is neerer, your comfort
is neerer, and so you are farther from judgement,
farther from destruction.</p>
               <p>Now, on the other side, it is to be considered,
that as this is the ayme of the godly man, to looke
to grace, and at the service of <hi>God,</hi> and at salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they travaile; So there is
another way that other men travaile, that looke
at sinne, at destruction. I doe but set one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that you may learne to know the difference:
there is a scope that every man hath, whatsoever a
man doth, though he consider it not, yet he takes
every steppe by vertue of that vtmost end that he
hath. There is a generation of men that ayme at
destruction, that ayme at sinne, at those <hi>wayes</hi> that
<hi>lead downe to the Chambers of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> if you object, and say, I but no man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2062:100"/>
pounds such an end to himselfe, there is no man
intends the destruction of himselfe.</p>
               <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> It is true, it is not the end of the man,
but it is the end of the course, as we say, it is not
<hi>finis operantis,</hi> but it is <hi>finis operis;</hi> as a theefe, that
steales, his end is not that he should come to the
gallowes, but his end is to get profit to himselfe,
but yet it is the scope of the worke, though not of
the workman; so I say in this case, a man that hath
not this ayme to serue <hi>God,</hi> to walke toward him,
though he obserue it not, his ayme is destruction,
that is the end of his worke, that way he walkes
in <hi>leads downe to the Chambers of death.</hi> So you
see, First, there is an end, a terme to which every
man goes; And, secondly, there is a terme from
which every man comes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly; in every Iourney there is a distance;
That is;<note place="margin">The distance in it.</note> that dissimilitude betweene <hi>grace,</hi> and vs,
and betweene <hi>God,</hi> and vs. Looke what distance,
and difference there is betweene grace, and sinne,
betweene righteousnesse, and wickednesse, that is
the space that every man is to goe, that is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that he is to passe through; so that even as
in a Iourney you cast some part of the way behind
you, and another part you are to passe vnto; so
you are to thinke in this Iourney: Looke how
much victory thou gettest over any sin, so much
of thy way thou hast passed. Againe; Looke in
what measure any sinne remaines vnmortified,
any lust is not fully overcome, so much of thy
way thou art yet to goe: so likewise, it is in the
defect of graces, that is the distance that thou hast
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2062:100"/>
to fulfill. So in every mans particular calling, that
course that <hi>God</hi> hath fixed to every man, that he
hath prescribed to every particular man, to some
longer, to some shorter, this is the distance of a
mans Iourney. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had a shorter course,
he fulfilled his course, he preached not aboue
three or foure yeares. <hi>Paul</hi> fulfilled his course
likewise, a longer race, but it was that which <hi>God</hi>
had appointed him; so the dissimilitude betweene
grace and sinne; and againe, the course that <hi>God</hi>
hath appointed every man he must fulfill, and
<hi>serue God in his time,</hi> this is the distance and the
space of this Iourney.</p>
               <p>Againe; the next to this is the ground: for a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
man must haue some thing to hold him vp,<note place="margin">The ground.</note> when
he walkes, the ground vpon which he walkes, is
the time of this life in this world, the latitude of
this life, that <hi>God</hi> hath afforded to every man, that
is the field, as it were, that he walkes in: we see in
the world great varietie of men, and varietie of
courses, that is the ground, the space allotted to
him, he may walke whither he will, he may walke
which way he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>But lastly (as there must be a terme to which,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
another from which,<note place="margin">The path.</note> as there must be a distance,
and a ground, so chiefly he, that walkes must haue
a certaine path, a certaine way to walke in. In a
wildernes, there is ground enough, but there is no
path, but when you goe to a certaine place, there
must be alwayes a certaine way, a certaine high
way, a path that leades to it: now the path that
we haue to walke in, you haue it diversly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2062:101"/>
in the Scriptures: <hi>Christ</hi> is said to be the way,

I will ranne the way of thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi>
saith <hi>David, when thou shalt inlarge my
heart:</hi> and of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it is said, <hi>they
walked</hi> in the way of <hi>Gods Commandements without
reproofe.</hi> These are said to be the wayes, or the
paths that we walke in, they all come to one:
Christ is said to be the way: because as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to a place, except he goe in the way that
leads to it, so no man can come to <hi>God</hi> the Father
without <hi>Christ;</hi> that is; without his intercession,
without his guidance, and direction, except he
lead you to the Father, that you come as sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with his bloud, as clothed with his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
except you come as being made accepted
by his intercession, you cannot be accepted, and
besides, except you goe the way that he directs
you: for he is the day-starre, <hi>springing from on
high,</hi> that guides our feete in the way of peace,
without him you cannot come to heaven, you
cannot come to the <hi>throne of grace:</hi> so he is said to
be the way: Againe, the spirit is said to be the way,
<hi>walke in the spirit;</hi> That is; walke according to
the guidance of the spirit, follow the direction of
the spirit; and so the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they are said to be the way; because they
are the rules we ought to walke by: So that the
way is, when, in the name of Christ, when, out of
respect to him, we walke by the direction of the
spirit, in the wayes of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2062:101"/>
when we obserue the rule. This is the way, this is
the path.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> if you aske how one should finde this
way?</p>
               <p>You must know,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that though this be the way

Commandements, I say, it is hard to finde them
out, except there be a particular gift given him
even as you see, there is a gift given to the dogge
to finde out the hare, to follow her steppes, there
is a certaine sagacitie given to that Creature, that
another wants, by which it followes the steppes
of the hare, which way soever she goes: (I may vse
it for a similitude, a farre-off expression) So, I say,
there is a sagacitie given to the Saints, a certaine
new qualitie, that others want, by which they are
able to finde out the steppes of <hi>Gods</hi> way; so that
they are able to tract him: When they are at a
losse, they will not run on vopon a false sent; but
cast about, (as sometimes they loose <hi>God,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they know not which way they must follow
him.) This gift we must labour to haue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> One thing more is to be added, that there is
this similitude in it,<note place="margin">Similitude</note> that as, when a man goes a

a little stepping to, &amp; fro,<note place="margin">A constant course.</note> and walking for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a walking as a man doth in a Gallery, but it

the course of a Christian life, it is a constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

good by a fit or two, but when he continues in
well-doing, when it is the ordinary constant tract

               <p>

with a Christian life.</p>
               <p>If a Christian life be of this nature,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> that it is like
a walke in a Iourney, that every act is a steppe,
then, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> it should stirre vs vp to consider
seriously, what busines we haue in hand, for what
purpose wee came into the world, namely, to
goe a Iourney, not to sit still, not to be idle, we are
to travaile a part of this Iourney every day, and
therefore the first thing we are to doe, is to choose
a right way: you must know therefore, that there
are many thousands (it is the common condition
of men in the Church) that thinke they are in a
right way, and so goe on in it without examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereas you must know this, that every man
by nature is set in a wrong way as soone as he
comes into the world, wherein he travailes, as in
a way that leads to destruction; so that, till a man
begin to see his error, till he begin to come seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to consider, this is not the way I should
follow, and to choose a contrary, No man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
towards heaven, no man is in <hi>Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>su,</hi> as we
say, no man is in this Iourney till then. <hi>David</hi>
sayth, he chose the way of <hi>Gods</hi> commandements;
that is; there must be a choice: for this must be a
speciall consideration, no man hath this without
choice, and not onely so, that is not onely meant,
to take it into consideration, that is naturall, but
then a man is said to choose, when he pitcheth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, when his resolution is fixed, when he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2062:103"/>
vpon this way. Therefore, when you heare
that there is such a walke, make that vse of it,
choose the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements. To
choose; that is, willingly to take that way, to goe
it resolutely, to sweare within himselfe, as <hi>David</hi>
sayth, <hi>I haue sworne that I will serue thee,</hi> and walke
in thy way. I say, this we should bring our heart
to, and you shall know it by this, whether you doe
so or no: A man, that chooseth a way, that resolues
to goe that way, if he be out of it at any time, and
be told, Sir you are out of the way, he is glad of
the admonition, he is willing to goe in to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
So that, I say, thou maist know, whether
thou choosest the way of <hi>Gods</hi> commandements,
what dost thou when any suggestion comes from
the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> that tels thee, this dutie ought to be
done, this sinne ought to be abstained from, art
thou obedient to it? When thou art admonished
by thy friend, that tels thee, this is not the way,
this is an error, this is an obliquitie, art thou ready
to turne out of it? art thou glad of such an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement?
When thou hearest rules given thee out
of the Word, from day to day, from Sabbath to
Sabbath, art thou willing to practice them, when
thy error is discovered to thee? It is a signe thou
choosest the way. Let a man resolue on the way to
a Coast, to a Cittie, when it is discovered to him
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is out of the way, certainely, if it be the
way that he hath chosen, he will easily be readie,
and willing to returne to it. Indeed, that is a signe
a man hath often the way. <hi>David</hi> chose to serue
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and therefore, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

his adulterie, and murther, he quickly returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
So it is with all the Saints, it is not so with
other men, when they are told of going out, they
goe on still, because, in truth, they haue not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
the way of <hi>Gods</hi> commandements.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> It is not enough to choose it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
but likewise, you must looke to every step
you take, take heede to every steppe in this way.
My <hi>Beloved,</hi> as you heard before, there is not an
action, but it is a step, it is a pace in the way that
leads, either on the one side, or on the other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards hell, or towards heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not enough to looke that you walke in
the way in generall, but likewise, you must ponder
your steppes. You see that expression <hi>Pro. 4.</hi> sayth
the <hi>Wise-man, Ponder thy wayes,</hi> and order thy
steppes aright; ponder thy wayes; that is, a man
is to consider every step he takes, is this right?
Doth this tend towards such a Iourney or not?
This pondering of our wayes, is exceeding neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
it is that which <hi>David</hi> constantly practised
<hi>Psal. 119. 36. I considered my wayes, that I might

wayes; that is; Except a man looke narrowly to
it, except he consider his steppes, from time to
time, except he reflect vpon them, and looke
which way they tend, he will not be able to keepe
the wayes of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements.</p>
               <p>And if you object now;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> why, but is it necessary
that a man must thinke vpon every action what his
end is, when a man is busie in his studie, when he

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, is it necessary that every particular
action should be looked vpon, that he should haue
this actuall thought, whither doth this step tend?</p>
               <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> 
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is not necessary, that it
should be done vpon every action, but that it
should be so farre done, as is necessarie, to keepe
vs in the right way, even as, you see, it is in a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
when a man resolues to goe from one towne
to another, he chinkes not every steppe he takes, I
am going to such a towne: for, by vertue of his
first intention he takes these steppes: so that the
marke and the ayme that he hath, is the cause of
every step, though he thinke not of it, every step
he takes: So in the actions that we doe, I say, if
the ayme be right, though we thinke not vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
action we doe, yet it is done by vertue of it,
and so <hi>God</hi> accepts of it. As, we see, an Arrow,
when it flyes to the marke, or a Bowle, when it
runs, there is not a new putting on, but by vertue
of the first strength, by which it was throwne out,
or by which it was shot, it passeth, and goes on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the marke, so it is in a mans life: by vertue
of the first ayme that a man hath, though he think
not of it, vpon every particular occasion, his heart
goes on, he travailes towards the marke: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I say, it is no necessary in every action. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
it is necessary that it be very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
done: because we are so readie to goe out
of the way. There is a straight way, that <hi>God</hi> hath
chalked out to vs, and we are readie, ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
to turne out, we haue still some byas, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vpon vs, that drawes vs out from that way.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2062:104"/>
Either some false feares, or some vaine hopes, or
some fancy, and inordinate appetite, some thing,
or other drawes vs out, that except a man looke
very narrowly to it, except he be ever and anon
reflecting vpon his wayes, he will not keepe the
way, therefore it is necessary, that we be still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
and pondering our wayes, and so much
the rather, because, as the Apostle sayth, <hi>Know you
not, that many run in a race;</hi> As if he should say,
all the world travailes towards heaven, every man
goes something that way: therefore, sayth he, take
heede; there are but a few notwithstanding, that
get the goale, that get the price, few that obtaine,
few that overcome: therefore, saith he, take heede
how you runne. So I say, there is much heede to
be taken in this race, many goe out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that goe from sinne a certaine way, but they
never come to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they walke a certaine way
in the Wildernesse, but they come not home.
Therefore, to direct you in it, you must know this,
that there is a length in this way, there is a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and a straightnes in this way; and thirdly,
there is a certaine breadth in this way. There is a
length in this way, and therefore you must goe
hastily in it, you must <hi>run the way of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi>
as <hi>David</hi> sayth: for there is a length in it;
that is; it will not be dispatched with an easie
pace. <hi>God</hi> requires every man to make hast in it,
he must quicken his pace in the way to heaven.
My <hi>Beloved,</hi> the cause why men goe on slowly in
this way, is from halting; because they halt in this
way: In other paces, sometimes we grow slow by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2062:105"/>
wearinesse, but in the wayes of <hi>Gods</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
still our slacknes comes from halting, and
therefore you haue that vsed often in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
men are said to <hi>halt betweene two opinions,</hi>
that is one kinde of halting, betweene two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he goes slowly forward in either of them, that
halts betweene two, he profits little, he goes slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on. As there is a halting betweene two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so there is a halting betweene two objects,
<hi>God</hi> and the world. A man desires to serue <hi>God,</hi>
and yet he desires to haue vaine glory, or desires
to make vp an estate, &amp;c. I say, these divers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
these divers respects to divers objects,
when a man hangs too much vpon the world,
when he hath an eye too much vpon vaine-glory,
when he is tooke vp too much with pleasures, and
divers lusts, this causeth men to halt in the wayes
of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements: halting, you know, is
either when one leg is sound, and another lanie,
or when we goe with one leg in a higher way, and
another in a lower way, it comes all to one; that
is, when the heart doth not wholly looke vpon
<hi>God,</hi> but lookes much to the world, therefore you
see men much dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched in worldly businesses, that
are over-come with them, that are drowned in
them, they goe slowly on in the wayes of <hi>Gods</hi>
Commandements, that goe with one leg in <hi>Gods</hi>
wayes, and another out of them: And so likewise
when one affection, and one desire shall be good,
and another shall be lame, this causeth a halting
in the wayes of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore, if you would
run, you must haue both feete whole, and sound,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2062:105"/>
without lamenes, and both feete must he in the
way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When a man is thus disposed, he runs the
wayes of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements; that is; let him
finde what is the cause of his halting, and of his
slacknesse, if it be worldly mindednesse, the way
to quicken him in his pace, is to weane his heart
from the world; if this be the cause that makes
thee slacke, and dull, and heavie, and indisposed
to prayer, and to other holy duties, something
thou doest, and thou goest in thy way, but slowly,
and dully, that is the way to heale it: And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if it be some strong lust, be it what it will
be, that causeth thee to halt, and to goe slowly on,
heale that, and thou shalt be able to run the wayes
of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements. <hi>David</hi> cals it a straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when he could not run. Therefore, sayth he,
<hi>I shall run the wayes of thy Commandements, when
thou hast inlarged my heart.</hi> That is; Every lust is a
straightning; the remooving of it giueth a libertie
to the heart, every lust is as fetters, and shackles
that straiten the spirit, that are a bondage to the
spirit, that take away the libertie of the spirit:
Therefore the remooving of the lust, whatsoever
it is, that sets thee free, as it were, and when thou
art free, and at libertie, when there is no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thou artable to run the wayes of <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
               <p>The second is,<note place="margin">Gods wayes straight.</note> there is a straightnesse in this
way, there is no way that leads to any place, but
it is straight: for, if it were crooked, it would not
lead to that place. So that every walke, every cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
walke is straight, so are the wayes of <hi>Gods</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:2062:106"/>
Commandements, they are straight; now straight
is a relatiue word; that is, it is betweene two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames,
as we say, it is straight, when a lyne runs
betweene two points, and goes not out, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, that we call straightnes, if there be
any exorbitation of the lyne, now it is not straight
but crooked, now the way is said to be straight
in regard of these two termes. A man indeede
goes from misery to happinesse, and the wayes
of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements, are the straight wayes
that lead to that; if you walke crooked in the way,
you step out to one of the two extreames; that is;
you step out from the way that leads to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
you step out to some trouble, to some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
to some evill, to some punishment, when
you step out from the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
So that that is to be observed, that this is
a straight way; And therefore, seeing this leads
straight to happinesse, every declination is a step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out to misery. You haue reason to take it;
for it is the shortest way, that is one condition:
you haue two motiues to take this way.</p>
               <p>One is,<note place="margin">Gods wayes nearest.</note> it is the shortest way; the other is, it is
the plainest way. We haue a rule in the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
Alwayes the straightest line is the shortest,
looke how much bending, and crookednesse there
is, so much the more length there is in it, the
straightest way is the shortest: So, if thou wouldst
goe the shortest way to happines, keepe the way
of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements, (if thou dost not know
that, thou goest about, thou art a looser by it)
that is the neerest way. For example; that I may
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2062:106"/>
a little expresse it to you, <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he would
goe about, &amp; not keepe the straight way, when he
would make hast to get the blessing, it was a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out from <hi>Gods</hi> wayes; was it not a going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to his happinesse? You know how many
yeares trouble it cost him. So <hi>David,</hi> when he
would goe out of the way, in his adultery, and
murther, did he not goe about towards his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines?
Was he not an exceeding great looser by
it? You know how much it cost him, what great
afflictions he had, the sword never departed from
his house; what great trouble, being cast out of his
Kingdome by <hi>Absalom?</hi> &amp;c. that was a going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to his happines. So this is a sure rule, let there
be any crookednesse in a mans wayes towards
<hi>God,</hi> it is a going about to happinesse. And so <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,
his heart was perfect all his dayes.</hi> But when he
was out of the wayes of <hi>God,</hi> when he stepped out
of these wayes, and made to his feete crooked
paths, did he not goe about for his owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?
The Prophet comes, and tels him, <hi>Asa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast done this, from hence thou shalt
haue warre: the case was this, <hi>Asa</hi> would needs
seeke to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and the King of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi>
for helpe, it was a sinfull pollicie in him, it
was a going about, he shuld haue kept the straight
way, and haue trusted <hi>God</hi> with it, when he would
doe this, when he was crooked in his wayes, it
was a leading about to his happines, the Prophet
comes and tels him, the host of the King of <hi>Aram</hi>
should escape out of his hands, and likewise he
should haue warre all his time, and so he had
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2062:107"/>
much trouble at home, and warre abroad, and at
length he was given vp to a sore disease that was
his death. Thus he went about, and so doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man when he finneth: for the other is the
straight way.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">It is the plainest.</note> As it is the nearest way, so likewise
it is the plainest way. When a man will goe out of
it, he meets with snares, there are vanities in those
wayes, as it is said, <hi>he catcheth the craftie in his
owne deceit,</hi> or in his owne actions, and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
1 <hi>Cor. 3.</hi> he catcheth the craftie; that is, if a
man will goe out of the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by any carnall pollicie and wisedome, it is
not a plaine way, it is a way wherein he shall meet
with one trouble or other, he shall meete with
some snares there, he shall not goe safely in it. So
that, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> you may take that for a sure rule,
when a man goes out of <hi>Gods</hi> wayes, he is not safe,
he is subiect to some snare, to some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where in
he may be taken: therefore let vs keepe the straight
way, it is the best, and it is the neerest. As it is said
of <hi>Ahymaaz,</hi> he ran the way of the plaine, and so
though <hi>Cushi</hi> went out before him, yet <hi>Ahsmaaz</hi>
came to his journeys end much before <hi>Cus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he went the way of the plaine: So he that
goes through the plaine way, though he seeme to
haue present disadvantage, and trouble, yet when
all is summed vp, that will bring him soonest to
his journeys end, he shall come soonest to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
and quiet that way, he that takes the fairest
course, by probabilitie in carnall wisedome, and
pollicie, and steppes out of <hi>Gods</hi> wayes, though he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2062:107"/>
thinke that the neerest way, yet he shall finde that
he goes about. Let a man thinke with himselfe,
by declining, I may escape such a trouble, such a
straite, such a disadvantage, that will befall other
men: perhaps thou maiest, but yet, I say, thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
about, thou art no gainer by this, it shall be paid
thee home in arrerages, thou shalt loose it in the
long race, thou shalt finde, that he that goes the
plaine way, shal come before thee to thy journeys
end, to the happines that we all ayme at; that is
certaine still, he that keepes the right way, he takes
the shortest way to happinesse, he that thinkes he
takes a wiser course then <hi>God,</hi> and therefore will
decline those troubles, by wynded wayes, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
brings vpoa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe by keeping the plaine
way, I say, he shall finde himselfe deceived, he
goes about towards his happinesse.</p>
               <p>The last is,<note place="margin">A breadth in Gods wayes.</note> as there is a length in this way, and
a straightnesse in it, so there is a breadth in this
way, there is a latitude, or breadth, a certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall
breadth. The way to some man is broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then to others, and to the same man the way
in some places is broader, in some narrower.
The <hi>Iewes</hi> way was narrower, then ours, there is a
Christian liberty that hath inlarged this way, and
made it somewhat broader to walke in: for, as the
Christian libertie is more so likewise is the way
broader: We haue more libertie then the <hi>Iewes</hi>
had in many things, we are freed from that <hi>yoke
of bondage,</hi> that strict observation of Mosaicall Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies:
And so againe, I say, one Christian
hath a narrower way then another; that is; as a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2062:108"/>
man is subiect to more temptations, to more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of sinne, so must he make his way narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he may not walke in so broad a path as another.
Againe, the same man in some part of his way
must choose a narrower way, in some he needs
not; As, for example, a man that is subiect to run
out in such a recreation, another man may walke
in a broader path in the vse of that recreation,
then he may: for to him it is an occasion, he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to be snared, and to be transported with it:
one man is apt to be carried to drunkennesse, if
he see but the Wine, if he come but neere it, he
must not <hi>looke on the Wine in the Cup;</hi> one man is
quickly set on fire with incentiues of lust with an
object, he may not come so neere, nor be so bold
with them as another man may, one man is apt,
if he come to such a company, to receiue some
hurt, to be intangled with them, he is apt to learne
their wayes, to goe along with them, such a man
may not be so bold to come neere that company,
as another may, that is not subiect to that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
so that there is a breadth and a narrownes
in these wayes.</p>
               <p>Now our care must be, not to goe beyond this
breadth: for it is a <hi>narrow way, there are few that
finde it, Math. 7.</hi> Therefore, I say, we had more
need looke to it, that we step not aside, that we
loose not our way. <hi>Beloved,</hi> it concernes vs much
to looke to it; because, when we goe out of <hi>Gods</hi>
paths, we are still exposed to some hazard, and to
some danger, we should looke to it, not onely for
obedience to <hi>God,</hi> but for our owne sakes: let a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2062:108"/>
man be found out of the breadth of this way; that
is, let him take more libertie then he may (for it
is profitable for vs to know both our libertie, and
our restraint,) and he shall finde still some misery,
or other shall come vpon him; take heede, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
least <hi>God</hi> meete thee out of the way at any
time; as he said to <hi>Eliah, What dost thou here?</hi> What
makest thou here <hi>Eliah?</hi> indeed it was his fault,
when <hi>God</hi> had beene with him so mightily, and
had given him rayne at his desire, to worke such
miracles: againe, to send fire from heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the sacrifices, and after to slay so many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of <hi>Baal,</hi> for a word of <hi>Iezabell,</hi> that was but
a weake Woman, to run from her so many miles,
as farre as his feete could carry him, it proceeded
from timorousnesse, and feare: <hi>God</hi> meetes with
him, and saith, <hi>What dost thou here Eliah?</hi> What
makest thou here? As if he should say; thou art
out of the way. Though the <hi>Lord</hi> dealt mercifully
with him, yet it was his fault, he was out of the
way, as sometimes feare puts vs out of our way,
and sometimes againe other passions, as <hi>Hagar</hi>
went out of her way from he mistris (as we see
in the Chapter before the text) <hi>Hagar Sarahs maid,
whence commest thou?</hi> And whither goest thou?
<hi>Gen. 16. 18.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 18.</note> Where he puts her in minde of that
dutie she did owe to <hi>Sarah,</hi> of that particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
she was in; As if he should say; <hi>Hagar</hi> dost
thou remember what thou art? dost thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what particular calling thou art in? Art thou
not <hi>Sarahs</hi> maid? Thou shouldst be about <hi>Sarahs</hi>
businesse, what dost thou here in the Wildernes,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2062:109"/>
running from thy mistris? If thou be <hi>Sarahs</hi> maid,
whence commest thou? And whither goest thou?
As if he should say; thou art out of thy calling,
thou art out of thy way.</p>
               <p>So you must thinke with your selues, when any
man goes out of his calling, when he goes out of
his duties of either of his callings, if <hi>God</hi> should
meete him, if an Angell should meete him, and
should say, What dost thou here? thou that art a
Minister, what dost thou doing the thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not to such a one to doe? Thou that art a
Tradesman, a Lawyer, a Student, whatsoever the
calling, and busines be, that <hi>God</hi> hath set a man
in, when he is stepping out to by-wayes, that are
not suteable to such a calling, <hi>God</hi> may say to thee,
and thou maist say to thy selfe, What dost thou
here <hi>Hagar, Sarahs</hi> maid? He puts her in minde
of her calling, so must we, and so much the rather,
because we are never out of our way, but at that
time we are from vnder <hi>Gods</hi> protection, we are
from within the pale, we haue no promise of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it makes vs exposed to some hazard, or other,
and, therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> be carefull of this. As the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> in the Wildernes went not a step, but as
farre as they saw the Cloud going before them,
so, I say, goe not a steppe, but as farre as you haue
a warrant, as farre as you see <hi>God</hi> going before
you, and this shall be for your comfort.</p>
               <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> it may be, <hi>God</hi> will lead me by
these straite rules to prison, to losses, to crosses,
to disgrace, to losse of preferment, to losse of
friends?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:2062:109"/>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> know this, that the Cloud, as it was a
direction to them, so it was a protection likewise,
they never followed the Cloud, but they were
safe, the Cloud was a defence to them wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they went: As we see, <hi>Esay 45. The Lord will
create vpon every place of Mount Sion, and vpon the
assemblies thereof, a Cloud of smoke by day, and a shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
flame of fire by night: for vpon all the glory there
shall be a defence.</hi> Before he had said he would lead
them by the spirit, this leading of the spirit, he
compares to the leading of <hi>Israell</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
as they were led with the Cloud, so shall you,
and if you follow the Cloud, it shall be a defence
to you; so, I say, walke with <hi>God,</hi> and he will be a
defence to you: it is no matter what the wayes
are, he is able to beare you out: for safetie is a part
of your wages; therefore that belongs to him,
your businesse is nothing, but to finde out what
your way is, and to walke in it, the care of the
worke belongs to you, and the other is not your
care: therefore (to shut vp this exhortation)
learne to doe this, to pray, that <hi>God</hi> would shew
you his wayes, that he will incline your hearts,
that he will reach you, as he doth the Ants, and
the Bees and not onely shew you the wayes you
are to walke, but giue you a secret instigation, and
inclination to them, and if you seeke him, and
your hearts be vpright, and depend vpon him,
he will shew you the path, that you are to walke
in: he puts in that condition, that your hearts be
sincere, and vpright. Againe, let vs depend vpon
him, that we may seeke to him, and trust in him,
and he will shew vs the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:2062:110"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And, as we are to seeke the way, so we must
run it,<note place="margin">Having found the way, wee must runne.</note> and not be slow, and slacke in it, but runne
the <hi>way of Gods Commandements,</hi> that is; goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.
Now every mans pace is according to his
meanes, and his abilitie, according to the might
that <hi>God</hi> hath given him: for that may deceiue vs;
A man may thinke he goes fast, when he goes but
slowly; because it is not according to his ability.
As, you know, a tall man when he doth but walke,
he goes much faster then a childe when he runs,
and yet he goes but slowly; because it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his abilitie. <hi>Beloved,</hi> our walking is
faster &amp; slower, according to the severall meanes,
and strength that <hi>God</hi> hath given to every one of
vs: some man hath a larger vnderstanding, hath
more grace, more experience, better education
then another; he must runne faster, he must doe
much more good in his owne person, he must be
more frequent, and servent in holy duties, he must
be more diligent in drawing others to <hi>God;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that hath received lesse, though he goe a
slower pace, yet it may be running to him, when
the former doth but walke: So, in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
A rich man that giues so much, it is but a
slow pace to him, when another, that is poore,
giues lesse, and that is a quicke pace to him. And
so in like cases. Therefore, I say, let vs choose out
the right way, let vs pray to <hi>God</hi> to direct vs, to
shew it to vs, vpon every occasion, that we may
not misse it. And let vs not onely walke slowly,
but let vs walke apace, and run the way of <hi>Gods</hi>
Commandements. So much for this first Vse.</p>

and continuednesse. Now our second Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
or Corollarie, we must draw from the
second Similitude; betweene a Christian life,
and a Iourney from place to place: I say, it agrees
with it in this, that they are constant, there is a
continued tenor of actions in a Christian mans
course: from whence, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay, we draw this: If it be

so, if there be this Similitude betweene them;
why, then let no man Iudge of himselfe, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by a step, or two; let him not judge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
I say, by a few actions, but let a man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what his walke is; <hi>Walke before me, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
Let a man consider what the ordinary, and
vsuall course of his life is: if you should doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
my <hi>Beloved,</hi> you shall finde it, it you judge a
man by an action, or two, you shall see, the best of
the Saints haue beene subject to divers fallings,
you shall see, <hi>Noah</hi> drunke, and you shall see <hi>Lot</hi>
committing incest, you shall see <hi>Moses</hi> speaking
vnadvisedly with his lippes, you shall see <hi>David</hi>
committing murther, and adulterie, and making
<hi>Vriah</hi> drunke, many such faylings you shall see in
all the Saints, you shall see <hi>Hezekiah</hi> boasting of
his treasure, you shall see <hi>David</hi> numbring his
people, &amp;c. So that, if you judge of men by a few
actions, and not by their constant course, you
shall condemne the generation of the just.</p>
               <p>Againe; It is as true on the other side, if you
will judge a wicked man by a few steppes, and not
by his ordinarie course, you shall be as readie to
justifie the wicked; you shall finde <hi>Cain</hi> sacrificing,
you shall finde <hi>Saul</hi> among the Prophets, you
shall see <hi>Iudas</hi> among the Disciples, you shall see
<hi>Herod</hi> entertaining <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> you shall see him
heare him gladly, doing many things at his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and admonition, this you see frequent, and
vsuall: Therefore, I say, were not to be judged
by a few actions, and a few paces, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
tenor of our life, by what we doe in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2062:111"/>
and vsuall course: for there is no man so good,
but he may haue some swarvings, though he haue
chosen the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements, yet oft
he may misse that way, oft he may be drawne out
of that way, oft he may be transported with some
strong temptation. Againe, on the other side,
there is scarce any man so bad, but sometimes he
may come into the way. You haue men that haue
no constant place to travaile to, yet, for a fit, they
may goe into the high way, as a theefe, or a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you know. Therefore, let vs learne hence,
not to judge our owne estate, or other mens, or
censure either our selues, or others by a few acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for I haue this ground for it, that you may
see the reason of the rule. A mans constant course
proceeds from the inward roote, and frame of his
disposition, from those principles, that are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in him, I say, his constant course proceeds
from it. Those same by-scapings out, whether to
good, or evill, they doe not proceede from the
frame of the heart, but from the evill that is in the
good, and from those good things that may be
in the evill. You shall see it so in nature: Take a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
let it be dammed, and stopped vp, yet let the
course of it be naturall, let the vent, and streame
of it be to goe downeward, at the length, it will
over-beare the damme, and will runne over it;
or let water, that is sweete, be made brackish by
the comming in of Salt water, yet, if naturally it
be sweete, at the length, it will worke it our; so, I
say, it is with every man, looke what the constant
streame of his disposition is, looke what the frame
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2062:112"/>
of it is, that which is most naturall, and inward
to a man, though it may be dammed vp, and
stopped in such a course, for a time, yet it will
breake through all impediments. Though there
be some brackish, some evill, and sinfull dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that may breake in vpon them, yet they will
weare them out; So it is as true, on the other side;
let a wicked man step into a good course by some
trouble, he is fallen into, or by some good famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie,
or good education, or some good Minister,
yet long he will not hold in it, he will breake
through that impediment: because his naturall
disposition, the streame of his heart runs another
way.</p>
               <p>Besides;<note place="margin">2. Cause.</note> As there is this ground of it, so there
is another cause of it; Because the outward occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
both for good and evill, I say, they are both
forcible, and yet transitory. Evill men, haue some
outward things, some outward helpes, which put
them on to a good course, they are so effectuall;
and yet <hi>God</hi> suffers them not alwaies to haue them,
but takes them away, they are but transitory,
Therefore a man may walke in a good course,
whose heart is not yet right, and yet long he shall
not doe it: because those outward occasions shall
be tooke from him: As, for example, <hi>Ioash</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in the wayes of <hi>God,</hi> all the while that <hi>Iehoiada</hi>
lived, here was the outward occasion, he was
drawne with another mans synewes, he was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with another mans heate; and when that man
was tooke away, you see, he fell to his owne
course, and by as againe; the outward occasion
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2062:112"/>
was strong, but it was but for a time, and so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his old course.</p>
               <p>The like in the case of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> he was hemmed
in for a time, with <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Prophet, but,
sayth the text, after his dayes, his heart was lifted
vp to destruction. And so <hi>Herod,</hi> he kept within
compas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, he was stirred vp to doe many things
at the Preaching of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> but he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
continue: for <hi>God</hi> so disposeth it, in his
providence, he will not suffer evill men alwayes
to haue these outward occasions of good; As it is
as true, on the other side, good men may haue
strong temptations, that may transport them for
a fit, but <hi>God</hi> will not suffer them alwayes to lye
vpon the godly, he will not suffer a temptation of
affliction, <hi>he will not suffer the rod of the wicked to
lye alwayes vpon him,</hi> it may for a time, and he may
for a fit, <hi>put out his hand to wickednes,</hi> he may, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some exigent, vpon a sudden, when he is put
to it, vpon some outward trouble, or cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, when
his heart is shaken, and distempered, when he is
not himselfe, but <hi>God</hi> so disposeth of it in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that they shall not alway lye vpon him,
but they shall be remooved in due season, as well
as the helpes to good shall be taken from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
So, you see, that may come to passe for a few
steppes, for part of the Iourney, an evill man may
goe right, and a good man may swarue from the
straight way: Therefore, let vs neither judge our
selues, nor others by it: for, if we should, we should
justifie the wicked, and condemne the generation
of the just. So much shall serue for this, and for
that point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:2062:113"/>The next, and maine point, that we intended,
was this,
<q>That whosoever hath interest in Gods All-sufficiencie,<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
must be a perfect man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is; He must be sincere, he must haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
of heart; though he may be subject to
many infirmities, yet <hi>God</hi> requires this of him.
If I be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> sayth he, to any (that is the
scope of it) he must be perfect with me; I am <hi>All-sufficient,</hi>
therefore be thou perfect; otherwise
thou hast no interest in this <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> of
mine. The poynt is cleare, and it is a poynt well
knowne to you, I shall not need to confirme it by
any other places of Scripture, but rather spend the
time in giving you the grounds of it: And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in shewing to you what this intirenesse, and
perfection, and sinceritie of heart is.</p>
               <p>First, I will shew the grounds why no man
shall be saved, he shall never haue part in this <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> except he be <hi>perfect,</hi> except he haue integritie of heart.</p>
               <p>First;<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> Because the new <hi>Adam</hi> should otherwise
not be so effectuall as the old; the new <hi>Adam</hi>
should not be so powerfull to communicate grace
and life, as the old <hi>Adam</hi> is to instill corruption
and sinne; for the finne, that hath beene convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to vs by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> hath an integritie in it,
it hath gone over the whole soule, there is a whole
<hi>bodie of death,</hi> that hath possessed vs; Now should
there not be in those redeeming actions by <hi>Christ</hi>
a contrary integritie, and perfection, a through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
holines, as I may call it? The plaister then
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2062:113"/>
should be narrower then the sore, and the remedy
should be inferior to the disease. <hi>Beloved,</hi> you
know, a leprosie is gone all over, except the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
went all over too from top to toe, I say,
there would not be an answerablenesse in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam,</hi> he should not be able to doe as much
good, as the first was able to doe hurt.</p>
               <p>Secondly; the worke of Redemption should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
be done but by halues, if the <hi>Lord</hi> should dispense
with imperfect holinesse. The workes of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you know, were perfect, <hi>God</hi> looked vpon all
his workes, and he saw that they were very good.
<hi>Beloved,</hi> doe you thinke the workes of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should come short of the workes of Creation?
Are not they likewise perfect? when the <hi>Lord</hi> shall
looke on that worke, shall he not say likewise, it is
very good? If you doe marke the parts of it, hath
not <hi>Christ</hi> redeemed vs from our vaine conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
The <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> doth not he mortifie every
sinfull lust? The bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> doth it not wash
every sinne? The Word, and meanes of grace,
doe they not strike at every rebellion? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
they doe, and therefore, there is an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
required in all: otherwise, I say, there should
be an imperfection.</p>
               <p>If you object,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> notwithstanding this, though
<hi>Christ</hi> hath redeemed vs, yet, you see, there are
many imperfections left in men; and therefore,
how can you say the workes of Redemption are
perfect?</p>
               <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> They are not perfect in degrees: for
they must haue a time of ripening; but that which
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2062:114"/>
wants any part of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though it be ripened,
when it wants the roote, and principle, when the
frame, and first disposition is not right, let it grow
vp never so fast, it will never be perfect: So this
is true of the workes of Redemption, of the works
of <hi>God</hi> in a mans heart, of destroying the workes
of Sathan, and setting vp a new building, which is
the worke of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the end, for which
he came; I say, this is true of it, it is perfect, it
wants onely growth: As, you may say, it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
seed, when it is ripe, it will be a perfect flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
or it is a perfect plant, when it growes vp, it
will be a perfect tree, it is perfect in all respects.
Such a perfection is in the workes of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and, if the heart of man be not entire, if the
worke of grace be not throughout, if there be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the principle, and constitution of it, there
should be a defect in the workes of Redemption,
that cannot be.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly; if there was not a perfectnesse of heart
wrought in all those that should be saued, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Gospell should be commands of
impossibilitie: for the Gospell requires at our
hands, that we should haue <hi>respect to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi>
that we should keepe the whole Law
in an Evangelicall manner; that is; in a true inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
the Gospell requires that we should loue
the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God with all our hearts,</hi> for the truth
of it; It requires, in a word, that we should keepe
the whole Law, in that sence, so as to square our
liues to it; to keepe it all in truth, and sinceritie,
though we cannot reach the highest top, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2062:114"/>
of it; Now if the heart were not perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that is; thoughout, there could be no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betweene the Commandement, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
and abilitie vpon which the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lyes: for it is certaine, except the heart
were perfectly holy, it could not keepe the whole
Law, there were an impossibilitie, we should not
reach every Commandement. And therefore,
there must be integritie and entyrenesse in the
heart, that we may be able to keepe them, at the
least in a Evangelicall sincere manner, though
wee cannot perfectly keepe the whole Law of
<hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is required: because otherwise there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
should not be a correspondencie, and agreement
betweene the <hi>Covenant</hi> on <hi>Gods</hi> part, and on ours:
<hi>God</hi> hath said, he will be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
this againe, on our part, that we be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his; <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> and
<hi>Psal. 18. I will walke perfectly with them that walke
perfectly with me;</hi> there are the termes of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
the <hi>Lord</hi> will haue it thus farre vpon even
termes, there shall be an integritie on both sides,
and therefore, if a man be holy but by halues, that
makes not the match, it makes not the agreement
betweene the <hi>Lord</hi> and vs: for all, and halfe is not
a match, but all, and all is that which makes the
match, the agreement, and sutablenesse betweene
<hi>God,</hi> and vs; and this is another reason why it is
required.</p>
               <p>Now last of all; this perfection, and integritie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is required: because otherwise, all that we doe is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2062:115"/>
nothing, it is to no purpose: for, except you seeke
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and serue the <hi>Lord</hi> with a perfect heart,
you serue him not at all, you cannot serue him as
<hi>God,</hi> you cannot serue him as a Maister, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serue him as a <hi>Lord,</hi> as a soveraigne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
except your hearts be perfect with him. This
reason I take out of <hi>Math. 6.</hi> a place well knowne,
<hi>No man can serue two Maisters.</hi> That is; It is true,
a woman may loue many as friends, but shee can
loue but one as a husband: A man may looke to
many subordinate ends, but he can haue but one
vltimate end: A man may haue respects, he may
affect many things in a remisse manner, but to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
many things in the highest degree, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
it can be bestowed but vpon one: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I say, to serue him as <hi>God,</hi> it cannot be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the heart be wholly bestowed on him; if you
will take in any thing with him, either credit, or
profit, or pleasure, now you make <hi>God</hi> an Idoll,
and you make that as <hi>God;</hi> so that whatsoever a
man loues, and respects or obeyes; I would aske
him but this question; Eyther it commands the
same thing with <hi>God,</hi> when it commands vnder
him, and so, in yeelding to that, you obey <hi>God</hi>
himselfe, or else, it commands somewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and if you yeeld to that, and not to the <hi>Lord,</hi>
you reject him, and take that for <hi>God.</hi> Therefore,
I say, the heart must be perfect, or else the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is nothing at all. So much shall serue to shew
you the grounds of this, why such a perfection,
and sinceritie, and integritie of heart, is required
in all those that shall be saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:2062:115"/>But the chiefest businesse will be here,<note place="margin">What sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes is.</note> to shew
you what this integritie is: the best way to finde
it out, is to open to you all those expressions in the
Scriptures, by which it is presented to vs, and you
shall finde them to be these fiue: And in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them, we shall sufficiently shew you, what
this sinceritie, or perfection of heart is.</p>
               <p>First, you shall finde it often expressed by <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and soundnesse,<note place="margin">Puritie.</note> 
                  <hi>blessed are the pure in heart;</hi>
and, <hi>God is good to Israell, even to them that are of a
pure heart.</hi> Now what is it to be <hi>pure?</hi> That is <hi>pure</hi>
which is full of it selfe, and hath no other Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall
thing mingled with it; So, that heart is
<hi>pure,</hi> which hath no sinne in it, which is holy,
which hath a renued qualitie of grace, which hath
an inward regenerate man, that will mingle with
no sinne, that is full of it selfe, and admits not the
mixture of any sinne. My <hi>Beloved,</hi> I must be wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnderstood here, I say, it admits not the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of any sinne. It is true, sinne may cleaue, and
adhere to a man, as drosse doth to the silver, but it
mingles not with the regenerate part, that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
not with it; that is, it enters not into the
frame, and constitution of a mans heart, it is not
weaved into the texture of his heart; it is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
into the very frame, and fabricke of it,
but though sinne be there, yet the heart still casts
it out of it selfe, it resists it, and rejects it, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth,
and clenseth it selfe from it, this properly
is a pure heart: As in other things, you say, a thing
is pure, when it is solid, and cleare, and vnmixed,
though it may haue some drosse, and some mudd
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2062:116"/>
cleaving to it, you say, it is pure gold, when it is
digged out of the minerall, though there be much
drosse in it, and we say, it is pure ayre, though,
for a time, there be many fogges, and mists, and
adventitious vapours within it; So, we say, it is
pure water, though there be many inundations of
mud cast into it, or that come from the spring, or
Channell, from which it runnes; So a man may
be said to haue a <hi>pure</hi> heart; that is, a <hi>perfect heart,</hi>
though there be an adhesion of much drosse,
many evill thoughts, that cleaue to him, yet, I say,
they mingle not with him; that is, <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is
certaine, that the holiest men haue a fountaine of
originall corruption in them, and from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
sinnes arise continually, as the scumme in
the pot, but yet, if the liquor be <hi>pure,</hi> and good,
if it be right wine, or right honey, whatsoever the
liquor is, though the scumme arise, still it purifies
it selfe, and casts it out; this is the propertie of a
<hi>pure</hi> heart: with the impure, it is quite contrary,
the scumme ariseth as in the other, but it is sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in, it is mingled, and confounded with it,
there is not such a segregating, such a clensing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in it but there is a mixing of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
this similitude you shall finde <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 12.
whence I take it, <hi>she wearied her selfe with lyes, &amp;c.
And her great scumme went not out of her.</hi> There is
a similitude going before of a <hi>boyling pot,</hi> into
which much flesh was put, to which he compares
the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> of that time, but this is the
Conclusion that <hi>God</hi> makes, <hi>her great scumme went
not out of her;</hi> As if he should say, it is very true,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2062:116"/>
the holiest men haue their scumme rising in their
hearts, as well as the wickedest men, but, sayth
the Prophet, here is the difference, <hi>her great scum
went not out of her:</hi> That is; though it arose, and
might haue beene cast out, it was not so, but was
sodden in, and mingled together. And therefore,
sayth he, <hi>her scum shall be consumed with fire.</hi> That
is; <hi>God</hi> will deale with her, as we doe with pottage,
when the scum is sodden into them, we cast them
in the fire, and the reason is given in the words
following; <hi>for I would haue purged thee, but thou
wouldest not be purged, therefore thou shalt not be
purged from thy silthines, till I haue caused my wrath
to light vpon thee:</hi> That is; As if he should say, I
put my Word to thee, which is as fire, I vsed such
ordinances, &amp; meanes, I withheld none of them,
and with those I would haue purged thee; not,
<hi>Beloved,</hi> by the inward purifying worke of the
spirit: for that could not efficaciously be resisted,
but I would haue purged thee; that is, <hi>my Word is
as fire;</hi> It is a segregating thing, that differenceth,
and puts a separation betweene the scum, and the
liquor, as that indeede was the end of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
to <hi>separate the precious from the vile.</hi> Now,
sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi> when these meanes were vsed,
when thou haddest the Prophets that would haue
separated the precious from the vile, in thy heart,
as well as to doe it in the companies of men: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this had no fruit, nor effect vpon thee, but still
thy scum, and filthines continued in thee, &amp; thou
wast not purged: therefore, I will destroy thee,
thou shalt never be purged, but my wrath shall
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2062:117"/>
light on thee: So, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is not the having
impurities in the heart, that makes the heart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
(that is the Conclusion I grow to) but it
is the suffering of them to be mingled, even with
the inward frame of the heart.</p>
               <p>Thus you shall finde, if you would know the
true difference betweene a pure and perfect, and
an impure and vnperfect heart, it stands onely in
this; he that hath a pure heart, there is in him a
clensing, and purifying, a segregating disposition,
that casts out whatsoever evill comes, though it
be continually rising, yet still hee casts it out,
though he be still falling into some finne, yet still
he is repenting, though many times he be myred,
yet still he washeth himselfe againe, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, he doth not, as the swyne, delight in it;
but he hath another, a contrary disposition, he still
clenseth himselfe from it: That I take to be the
meaning of that, <hi>Math. 15.</hi> where it is said, <hi>That,
which comes from within the man, as adultery, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp;c. they defile the man.</hi> The meaning is this,
when sinne riseth in a man from day to day, if he
cherish sinne, and entertaine it, and suffer sinnes
to dwell, and abide in his heart quietly, without
disturbance, if he suffer them to be sodden in, as it
were, now they defile the heart, But if sins arise
in the heart, and he continually resist them, he
continually cast them forth, he continually clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
&amp; purifieth himselfe from them, such a man
is not defiled with them, not is his minde defiled,
not his conscience defiled; but notwithstanding
this continuall Ebullition of evils (that I may so
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2062:117"/>
call it) he is a man of a pure heart, and perfect with
<hi>God,</hi> and that, I say, is one of the expressions of
<hi>purenesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so likewise <hi>soundnesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Soundnesse.</note> when a man is sound
at heart, that is another expression of this perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Now a thing is said to be sound (as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
you know, is said to be sound, when it is not
rotten at the core, though there be many specks
in it; and a Ship is said to be sound, when there is
no leake in it, though it may haue some other
flawes, and defects; And a Vessell is said to be
sound, when there is no clift in the bottom,
though it may otherwise be brused, and battered,
yet, you say, it is a sound vessell) I say, so it is in
this case, when the bottom of the heart, and the
inward frame of the heart is right and sound.
Though a man be subject to many faylings, yet
this is a perfect man, he hath a sound heart;
whereas, on the other side, take a man, my <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
(that we may shew you what this rottennesse
at heart is) take a man, I say, who doth admit a
constant neglect of any duty, or an ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of any sinne, such a man may properly be
said to haue a leake in the bottom of his heart, to
be rotten hearted, to be vnfound at the bottom;
But a man, that, though he be subject to infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet had rather dye then omit a knowne duty,
or to be in a knowne sinne, I say, this man, though
he haue many infirmities, yet he hath a sound
heart: And the reason of it is this, because, such a
man although he haue some weaknesse, some sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and infirmitie hanging vpon him, yet he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2062:118"/>
will grow it out, as one that is sound in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
will weare out his sicknesse, and distemper, as
it is said, if the inside be cleane, the outside will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
And that is as true, on the other side, let the
inside be rotten, though there be a faire and a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
outside, as in an Apple oft times, that doth
not continue long, but rottennesse will possesse
the outside also; That we see often in experience,
and you shall seldome see it otherwise; (I thinke
there is scarce an example of it) but that an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
a man of an vnsound heart, though he may
carry a faire shew long, yet, in the end, even the
outside shall be tooke away, that shall vanish also,
and rottennesse shall seize vpon it: for that is the
nature of things, that are vnsound, they stay not
there, but they putrifie, and corrupt more and
more; So that, you see throughout the Scriptures,
still those that were of imperfect hearts; that is,
that had vnfound hearts, they were discovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their death; as <hi>Amaziah</hi> was, he held out long,
and so was <hi>Ioash,</hi> and divers others; It is a rule, I
thinke, that seldome fayles: because <hi>God</hi> hath said,
I will curse <hi>the name of the wicked,</hi> and it <hi>shall rot.</hi>
Now except their hypocrisie should be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in time, and that their outside were removed,
and made as rotten as the inside, how should his
name rot? So much shall serue for this first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly; you shall haue it expressed by <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie,</hi>
and singlenes of heart;<note place="margin">Simplicitie.</note> he, whose heart is

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
a man that hath a simple heart, a heart without
guile, a single heart. Now, if we can finde out
what this singlenesse of heart is, this singlenesse of
eye, and of heart, you will finde out this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is here spoken of; <hi>Walke before mee, and be
thou perfect.</hi> Now a single heart is called so from
the singlenesse of the object, that is a <hi>single eye,</hi>
that lookes but vpon one object, and that is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
heart, that lookes but vpon one thing: likewise
that is a <hi>double eye,</hi> and a <hi>double heart,</hi> that lookes
vpon two objects, and is divided betweene two,
and knowes not which to choose; like a man that
is in <hi>bivio,</hi> in a double way, he stands, and lookes
on both, and knowes not which to take; so an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
hearted man, an vnsound hearted man, he
stands, and lookes vpon <hi>God,</hi> and vpon the world,
and he knowes not well which to choose, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he is following the one, sometimes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this is his condition, he is distracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
both; such a man hath a double eye, and
therefore, sayth the text, <hi>a wicked eye:</hi> for so it is
called, <hi>if the eye be single, all the body is light, but
if the eye be wicked:</hi> (for so it must be interpreted)
if the eye be double, which is a wicked eye; So,
my <hi>Beloved,</hi> an vnsound harted man is not descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to you by any thing so plainely, and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
as by this, that his heart is not pitched vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>God</hi> alone; but he hath an eye vpon <hi>God,</hi> and
an eye vpon credit, he hath an eye vpon <hi>God,</hi> and
an eye vpon his walth, vpon his pleasures, or
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2062:119"/>
whatsoever it is, when there are two objects: for,
in that regard a man is sayd to haue <hi>a heart and a
heart,</hi> not as commonly it is taken to make a shew
of one thing, and haue another within; But it is a
heart and a heart, when there are two objects, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the heart is set, that the heart is divided
betweene two, &amp; so is cloven asunder, as it were:
And so it is a double heart, by way of division,
and not by having one thing in shew, and another
within. Now then, if you will finde out what a
perfect man is, I say, it is he that hath a fixed reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to cleaue to <hi>God</hi> alone, that hath his eye
vpon him, and vpon nothing besides. This is a
single heart, when a man shall resolue (for instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will best make it cleare to you) when a man
shall say, as <hi>Ioshuah</hi> did, Well, sayth he, I see you
are readie to take divers wayes, but I am resolved
for my part, for me and my house, <hi>we will serue
the Lord,</hi> that I am resolved on. So <hi>David, I haue
chosen the way</hi> of his <hi>commandements, I haue sworne
to keepe them, and that I will doe:</hi> When a man is
once resolved throughly, when he is grounded,
and hath a setled resolution, an vnchanged resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that pitcheth him vpon one, he is no longer
in doubt betweene two, this is a perfect hearted
man, So <hi>Moses</hi> takes that resolution, I will <hi>suffer
affliction with the people of God,</hi> as if he should say,
I haue chosen it, whatsoever become of mee,
though I be a banished man, though I liue a poore
life, though I turne from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> sonne-in-Law
to keepe sheepe in the Wildernes, yet this is my
resolution, here I haue fixed my staffe, this will I
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2062:119"/>
doe. Herein the perfection, and integritie of his
heart was seene; So the three men, <hi>Sidrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sech,</hi>
and <hi>Abednego,</hi> This, say they, we are resolved
vpon, whether we be delivered, or not delivered,
whether we dye, or liue, whatsoever come vpon

                     </gap>b,</hi> (the place you know) <hi>though he

multiplie miseries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, even to the very death;
yet I am resolved to serue him, my heart is there
pitched, his, will I be. This is, <hi>Beloved,</hi> to haue a
single eye, and a single heart; When the heart is
divided, it is imperfect, such a man is <hi>vnconstant
in all his wayes,</hi> sayth <hi>Iames:</hi> Such a one was <hi>Saul,</hi>
and such a one was <hi>Amaziah:</hi> that indeede is the
case of all hypocrites. And to this, I adde that
which is said <hi>Math. 8.</hi> the fourth ground is said to
haue an <hi>honest heart,</hi> (I put them together, a single
heart, that I would explaine to you, they come
much to one,) an honest heart stands in this, that
a man resolues to serue the <hi>Lord</hi> with <hi>patience,</hi> and
with <hi>abstinence,</hi> that is the definition, that I will
giue of it, he that hath an honest heart, he resolues
to serue <hi>God</hi> in all things with patience, and absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
one of them is exprest in the text, <hi>he brings
forth fruit with patience,</hi> the other I adde, for a
more full explication of it. The meaning is this,
he hath an vpright, and honest heart, that so pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vpon <hi>God,</hi> that he will not be drawne aside
for any thing: Now there are but two things that
draw vs aside; that is, eyther persecution afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and trouble. And for this the honest heart
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2062:120"/>
hath patience, he resolues to suffer them, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be, and therefore he is able to goe on;
or, on the other side, pleasures, and divers lusts,
that drew away the third ground, as persecution
did the second; here he hath a resolved abstinence,
he is content to part with them, and to be without
them: therefore he brings forth fruit when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth not; that is, another may haue a faire
blade, but either persecution, or else pleasures, and
divers lusts come betweene, and intercept his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie,
that he never comes to any bearing of
fruit, to any purpose; This expression I put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with singlenes of heart, a heart without guile,
and without mixture, because there is a similitude
betweene them. So much fo that expression like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third Expression there is in the Scripture,
which you shall finde in these words,<note place="margin">Integritie.</note> 
                  <hi>Ier. 3. 10.
They did not turne to me with their whole heart, but
faignedly.</hi> And very oft, <hi>Thou shalt serue the Lord
thy God with all thy heart.</hi> So that the wholnes of
the heart, the integritie of the heart, he that hath
this is a perfect man, he, that wants it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
hearted man.<note place="margin">What it is.</note> Now what is this Integritie,
and wholnes of heart,<note place="margin">In 3. things.</note> you shall see in these three,
the integritie of the subject, the integritie of the
object, and the integritie of the meanes, whereby
the subiect, and the object are joyned together.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Integritie of the subject, that is the heart
of a man,<note place="margin">The integritie of the subject.</note> that I call the subject; The Integritie of
the object I call the Commandements, when he
hath respect to all of them; The Integritie of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2062:120"/>
meanes I call that, which brings the heart, and
the Commandement together; that is, the vse of
all holy ordinances, and the abstinence from all
occasions, that may draw vs another way. So
now he is a <hi>perfect</hi> man with <hi>God</hi> that first hath a
whole heart; that is, such a heart whereof every
part, and facultie is sanctified; There is no part
of it, but it is seasoned with grace, there is no
wheele in all the soule, but it is turned the right
way, according to that 1 <hi>Thes. 5. He is sanctified
throughout, in body, soule, and spirit.</hi> I say, when a
man shall finde every thing within him readie to
prayse the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to looke toward the <hi>Lord,</hi>
all that is within him. There is not any thing
within him, of which he can say, the bent of it is
another way. I say, such a man hath an integritie
of heart: Another man, you shall finde it thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with him, that, though in many things he
wish well, and hath a good meaning, and good
purposes, yet there is something, or other, hath
stollen away something in his heart, something
within him is not right, it may be in his feare, he
cannot say he feares <hi>God,</hi> and nothing else: for
there are many things that he feares more then
<hi>God,</hi> so he cannot say of his loue to <hi>God,</hi> that that
is right, it may be, it is misplaced, though many
other things may be right in him, he loues riches,
he loues credit, he loues reputation, he loues his
ease, and conveniencie, his practise, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
So that, if <hi>God</hi> and these should come in
competition, he would be readie to violate his
conscience towards him, rather then to part with

these: And so his griefe, that is not principally
for sinne, there is somewhat, or other, that you
shall finde him fayling in, there is not an integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And secondly, there is as little in the object;
he hath not <hi>an eye to all the commandements,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Integritie in the object.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the perfect hearted man, there is no dutie but
he giues vp his heart to it: And againe, there is
nothing forbidden, no sinne, but his heart is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from it, and he resists it to the vttermost.
You shall see this expression, <hi>Iam. 3. He that can
guide his tongue is a perfect man, in many things we
sinne all, if any man sinne not in word, he is a perfect
man: Iam. 3. 2.</hi> Compare this with <hi>Iam. 1. 26.
If any man among you seeme to be religious, and
refraineth not his tongue, but deceiues his owne heart,
this mans religion is in vaire.</hi> I say, you may take
but this one instance, that this is the judgement
of the <hi>holy Ghost:</hi> Should a man haue an eye to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Commandement, and should he but fayle
in this one thing, not bridling his tongue, but
giue vp his tongue to evill speeches, to let it
walke loose, vp and downe, whither it will, if he
doe but neglect this one particular, yet, sayth the
Text, all the rest of his Religion is but vaine;
Why? because there is not an Integritie in the
object, he hath not an eye to the whole Law, so
that, if a man fayle in this, he is not a perfect
man, if either it be in the subject, or in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Or thirdly; if it be in the meanes, that knits
these together;<note place="margin">Integritie of the meanes.</note> that is, take a man that will not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2062:122"/>
vse all <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances conscionably, and in their
season; that he doth not pray, and receiue the
Sacrament, and vse the Communion of Saints,
and fasting, and every one in their season: I say,
if he doe not vse all the meanes: And againe, if
he doe not abstaine from all the occasions, but if
he venture vpon evill occasions, and incentiues
to lust, vpon such objects, as are readie to worke
vpon him, I say, if there be a defect in these, he
is an vnperfect, and vnsound hearted man; as
you may say of a mans bodie, if you see those
things that are essentially to a mans health, if he
faile in any of them, he will not drinke, nor he
will not eate, nor he doth not sleepe, he fayles in
the meanes that should make him sound; or else,
if he adventure vpon the occasions that may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him, he venters vpon poysoning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
dyet, infected, and pestilent ayre, &amp;c.
he cannot haue a sound bodie; no more can such
a one haue a sound soule: So, I say, that the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and integritie of the heart, it lies in these
three put together. First, the heart must be all
sanctified: If you say, how shall wee know that?
Thus: he hath respect to every Commandement,
he fayles not in any thing, not in looking to his
thoughts, not in looking to his speeches, he doth
not neglect any affection that riseth in him, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time.</p>
               <p>But how shall a man know that, whether he
haue done this?</p>
               <p>So they hang, one vpon another, that you may
know the first by the second, and the second by
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2062:123"/>
the third, you may know whether a man haue an
eye to every Commandement, if he vse all the
meanes, and abstaine from all occasions of sinne:
for if thou doe not this, pretend what thou wilt,
thy heart is false; So much for this third.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth Expression, that I finde in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is <hi>vprightnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vprightnesse.</note> or straightnesse of heart: the
word, in the originall answers (<hi>Rectitudo</hi>) and an
vpright man, in the originall is as much as (<hi>vir
rectus</hi>) a straight man: <hi>Marke the</hi> way of the <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi>
and perfect <hi>man, his latter end is good,</hi> it <hi>is
peace, Psal. 37.</hi> That is, of a straight man: So the
straightnes of the heart, if we can finde what it is,
we shall know what it is to haue a perfect heart
with <hi>God.</hi> Now the straightnes of a man (for so
I will rather expresse it) in the Concrete is seene
in this, whether he hath straight &amp; vpright ends:
An vpright man you shall know by his aymes,
he hath a right end; the ayme, and scope, and
marke, that his eye is vpon, is <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and his
owne saluation, to doe, and suffer the will of <hi>God,</hi>
whatsoever it is; that is, to be faithfull, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in his Calling, to be serviceable an profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to others, these are the things that are in his
heart, these are the right ends, and he is sayd to
haue a right heart, whose ends are right, that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vpon right, and straight ends, and likewise,
he that goes by a straight rule: for a right end ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath a crooked rule leading to it. But, if a man
would know whether he hath a right end; thou
shalt know it by this, there needs not any oblique
way to lead to such an end, but thou wilt goe by a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2062:123"/>
straight rule; that is, the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
is the rule that thou wilt walke by:
Therefore if thou finde this in thy heart, that
there are devices, and plottings, and windings,
and turning wayes, that thou projectest to thy
selfe to bring any end to passe, now thou goest
not by a straight rule, but by a leaden <hi>Lesbian</hi>
rule, by a bended rule: whereas a right man, his
eye is still vpon the rule, he considers not this,
and this I will bring to passe; but he considers
with himselfe, what is the rule I ought to walke
by; As indeede every man hath some certaine
rule, and principle in his heart, and all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that hee doth, proceede from those secret
rules, though himselfe take no notice of them.
Now this is planted in the heart of an vpright
man, that still he goes by a straight rule, though
he could desire many things might be brought
to passe, yet if the rule will not hold, he will not
seeke it. This you shall finde <hi>Gal. 6. Peace on the
Israel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of God, as many as walke by this rule.</hi> They
are the true <hi>Israell,</hi> that keepe the right rule; so I
will commend this to describe to you a right,
and straight man, when his end is right, and his
rule is right: That is; when his heart is not a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
heart: for it hangs all vpon a string, crooked
ends, and crooked wayes, and a crooked heart.
He that hath a right heart; that is, not a perverse,
and froward heart; as we see <hi>Pro. 17. 18. A fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heart</hi> (as the translation is, that is, a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
heart) <hi>it findes no good.</hi> A man is then sayd
to haue a crooked heart, when if you will lay to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2062:124"/>
him any straight rule; that is, giue him any right
precepts, tell him this you ought to doe, this is
the iust course<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the way you ought to hold,
you shall never bring a crooked heart, and a
straight lyne together, his heart will still be star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside from it, it will not cleaue to it, it will
not accommodate it selfe to that: for his heart
is crooked. Therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> when wee giue

a straight heart, straight Counsell, and it would
soone agree: such an expression you see <hi>Psal. 125.
He that seekes himselfe in crooked wayes, I will leade

he be a perfect man, or no: you will say, how
shall we doe it? Indeede, my <hi>Beloved,</hi> I confesse
it is a hard thing to doe: for men are children in
vnderstanding; and, as children are apt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with guilded things, they see the outside
to be fayre, they see a fayre peece of gold, but
they are not able to finde out the base mettall,
that is hid within; So it is our case, for the most
part, we are not able to finde out this truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our hearts be imperfect, and vnsound, and
rotten, or no: Therefore we had neede of helpe,
I will name one or two.</p>
               <p>And this is one rule (I take but such as I finde
in Scripture) that is a rule that our Saviour giues,<note place="margin">1. Tryall.</note>
by which you may try your selues; sayth he to the
young man, when he comes to professe to him,
that he had done thus and thus from his youth,
saith he, <hi>if thou wilt be perfect, goe sell all that thou
hast:</hi> As if he should say; wouldest thou know
now if thou be perfect (those are the words) that
is, whether thou haue a sound heart, or no, <hi>goe
sell all that thou hast:</hi> That is, thou shalt know it
by this, that is the meaning of rhe Rule, <hi>Goe sell,
&amp;c.</hi> Let a man looke round about him; if there
be any thing in the world, any evill, any calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that he is not willing to suffer; if againe, there
be any blessing, any comfort, that he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

such a man is an vnsound hearted man: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
put the case that such a thing befall him, as

I will endure other things, but for that, I

<hi>God</hi> will bring one to it, at one time or other: or
againe, put the case a man say thus, I will endure

an Owle for every body to wonder at, this is a
thing I can never endure, let this man be put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

is, a thing that seemes strange to worldly men,
that shall bring the censure of them vpon it, let
him be put to passe through evill report, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he must be, let him be put to walke in the
wayes of righteousnesse, it sometimes <hi>seemes
strange to them that you</hi> doe not thus and thus,
such a man will deale vnsoundly, he will discover
himselfe to be rotten hearted.</p>
               <p>So againe, a man that saith thus with himselfe,
I will not loose my practise, I will not loose my
imployments, I will not loose my trade, I will

any thing in the world, I will not stand to giue

and thinke what is neare, and deare vnto him,
except he be inwardly willing to part with it,
that he can say, if any of the wayes of <hi>God</hi> fall
crosse with this; If I be any whit hazarded in the
keeping of a good conscience, by keeping this,
I will part with it: I say, except thou canst say
this, it is certaine thou hast a rotten heart; And
the like I may say for suffering; If a man say, such
a great mans favour I will not loose, my making,
or my marring depends vpon it, if there be any
such case, be it what it will be, thou art an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound

that; <hi>If any man will be my Disciple, he must denie

(he may take vp to himselfe a profession to be a

shewes, as he will, to be my Disciple, but a true
and a genuine Disciple he cannot be) he cannot
be my Disciple, except he deny himselfe in every

in thy heart, thou fallest short, in that thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is not so broad, as the <hi>Lords;</hi> that is, that
his law requires, that sayth, <hi>thou shalt not lust:</hi>
And so againe; perhaps thou sayest, he hath done
me wrong, and I will doe him no iniustice, but
an <hi>eye for an eye,</hi> thou requirest justice according
to retaliation, and proportion: But that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but thou must forgiue perfectly: if hee
haue done thee two or three or foure wrongs,
thou must beare them, and leaue revenge perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>God:</hi> if you object, this is hard, who can doe
it? He saith, <hi>be perfect, &amp;c.</hi> so you see the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it. If you would finde out now, whether
your hearts be perfect or no, consider whether
the latitude of them be such, whether it be thus
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2062:127"/>
broad, that is (that I may expresse it fully to you)
whether you walke so exactly, that you haue not
onely an eye to the maine poynts of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
but you obserue the least particle
of every Commandement, the least Iota, the least
pricke, and poynt, that you finde in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
               <p>Except you doe this, I say, your hearts are not
perfect: the scope of the Chapter is to require
the exact keeping of every Commandement, to
the least, and to the smallest things. And there
are these three reasons put together, to confirme
it.</p>
               <p>One is; for, sayth he, every Iot of the Law, is
of so much worth, though you thinke it a small
thing, <hi>That it were better that heaven and earth
should perish, then that it should.</hi> It is of greater
price then the whole world. Therefore the <hi>Lord</hi>
will not haue the least jot of the Law to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
               <p>Againe; sayth he, the <hi>Pharisies</hi> would keepe the
great Commandements, the principall poynt,
and part of every Commandement; but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of it, the nicer poynts of it, they would
not keepe. And, sayth he, <hi>except your righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
goe beyond theirs, except you goe further then
theirs, you shall never be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the last is, that I named to you before,
<hi>except you be perfect, &amp;c.</hi> there must be such a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
for the extension of your perfection,
though not for the intention, and degrees of it,
as is in your heavenly Father, you cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2062:128"/>
else. Therefore, if you say, this is a hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<hi>Beloved,</hi> you must know this, that <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> hath given to all those that shall be saved
<hi>grace for grace,</hi> that looke as he requires perfection
of obedience, in a latitude answerable to all the
Commandements, to all the particles of them,
even a perfection answerable to his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
so he hath given vs grace for grace, that
is, he hath given vs an inward abilitie of graces
which answer every Commandement; he hath
given vs grace for grace, as the Father giues lim
for lim, part for part, there is not a little finger,
not a toe, but the Father giues it the Sonne, and
the Sonne hath given it to vs, <hi>Moses brought the
Law, but grace comes by him;</hi> and when he would
shew what grace it is, it is grace of such a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that it enables you <hi>to be holy, as he is holy in
all manner of conversation,</hi> there is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
like that <hi>to be perfect as &amp;c.</hi> Therefore,

he that thinkes thus with himselfe; Alas, these

he that despiseth any of his wayes; that is, the least

that despiseth any of his wayes, any part of <hi>Gods</hi>

               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Difference.</note> you shall finde this difference between
them, that a man whose heart is <hi>perfect</hi> with
<hi>God,</hi> though he doe relapse into sinne, yet still
he gets ground of his sinne, euen by euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse;
marke it; I say, he gets ground of sinne,
and grace gathers strength by it; whereas, on
the other side, an vnsound-hearted man, the
oftner he fals, the more sinne gathers strength,
and euen the goodnesse, he seemed to haue had,
is lessened more and more, till, at length, it bee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2062:131"/>
quite abolished. This is a point much to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
and the ground of it is this; because any
grace, where it is a proper grace, where it is a
right grace, let it be wounded by any relapse,
by any transgression, I say, it gathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trength,
euen by that relapse, it is the nature of true grace
so to doe; It gathers strength euen from the
contrary, as fire doth when it is compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with coldnesse, by an Antiperistasis, so it
is with grace: It is a common saying that you
haue, and true, as you commonly vnderstand it,
that Vertue growes stronger when a man fals
into affliction: but more true, if thus taken,
that grace gathers strength, when it selfe hath
receiued a wound, when the grace it selfe is
weakned, as thou thinkest, it gathers more
strength: As for example, let a sound-hearted
man, whose grace is true and right, and genuine,
and not counterfeit, let him fall into any trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
that giues a wound to his graces, say he
fall into an act of intemperance of anger and
passion, he gathers more strength by it; euen
these graces they grow brighter by it: It is not
so with other men, the more they fall; the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
they grow; <hi>Dauid,</hi> when once he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the sinne of cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi>
garment; none was more carefull then he was
afterward, he would not offer him the least vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
And so <hi>Peter,</hi> when that grace of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and boldnesse for the Truth, had once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a wound by his denying of Christ, you
see what strength hee gathered by it, hee grew

was thereby cleansed and emptied forth: So
likewise <hi>Peters</hi> cowardlinesse and fearefulnesse
was discouered by that act, hee knew it more,
and therefore he was more watchfull against it,
hee gathered more strength against it: so that
this is the nature of the relapses of the Godly,
that still they empty their hearts more and
more of those sinnes that they fall into: againe;

               <p>The second is;<note place="margin">2. Difference.</note> though a godly man fall
backe to sinne againe and againe, yet hee neuer
fals backe to the allowance of any sinne: there
is a great difference, my <hi>beloued,</hi> betweene these
two, betweene returning to the act of a sinne,
and the allowance of it: Another man doth
not onely returne to the sinne, but hee returnes
likewise to the continuance in it, he is ready, in
the end, either to excuse the sinne, to finde out
some deuice and excuse for it, or else hee is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to say, I see it is impossible for me to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it, I see there is no remedy, I must giue
vp my selfe to it: This you shall see in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapses
of <hi>Saul; Saul</hi> tooke a resolution more

more; and no doubt this resolution was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
hearty for the time; but, you see, hee
did not onely returne to the act, but to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in it, and an allowance of himselfe in it.
So likewise did <hi>Pharoah,</hi> hee resolued many
times that hee would let the People goe, and
made that promise to <hi>Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he <hi>Lord,</hi>
that he would let them goe; but, you see, hee
returned againe, not onely to the sinne, but to
such an allowance of it, that hee excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in it, hee thought rather, hee had erred in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2062:133"/>
his purpose of letting them goe, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
still to retaine them. This you shall finde
in all the falles of Hypocrites, in all their relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that in the end (howsoeuer for a time they
may resume their purposes againe) they weare
them out, and they step backe to a resolution
to continue in that sinne; they thinke thus with
themselues, I see it is a sinne that preuailes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, I am not able to resist it, it is too
strong for me, and therefore I will goe no more
about it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly;<note place="margin">3. Difference.</note> as there is a difference in this;
so there is a difference in their manner of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming,
and in their manner of returning,
when they arise out of a sinne, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
themselues from it after a relapse, by
which you may iudge likewise; for you may
iudge the one by the other: A man whose
heart is vnsound, may take to himselfe a strong
and fixed resolution, by which hee may resist
the sinne, and yet this banke may bee borne
downe by the violence of Temptation: But,
in a godly man the resistance is otherwise, and
accordingly the relapse is of a different nature:
for the resistance is after this manner, it is as
when you see one streame resist another, as you
see in Riuers that are subiect to ebbing and
flowing, there runnes a contrary streame that
ouer-beares it; so it is in those that are sound-hearted,
there is a strong inclination, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them another way, such as that expressed,
<hi>Gal. 5. 17. the spirit lusteth against the flesh:</hi> so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2062:133"/>
that, if you marke the manner of their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming,
the manner of their rising out of
their relapses, you shall finde them to bee in
this manner; put the case the flesh, for some
brunt, for some fit, haue gotten the better,
notwithstanding, saith he, the spirit lusts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and suffers not the flesh to doe what
it would; that is, there is a contrary streame
within him, which resists those desires of the
flesh, that binds them againe, and leades them
captiue, as, before, the spirit was led captiue:
In others it is not so; there may be a certaine
fixed resolution, which may resist a strong
temptation, as a Banke or a Rocke resist a strong
billow: but there is a great deale of difference
betweene this and those risings out of relapses
that are done by a contrary streame, by the
lusting of the spirit: for they haue no such
spirit in them, to lust against the flesh, and
so to binde it, as it were, to ouercome it, that
they returne no more to those sinnes to which
before they were giuen vp.</p>
               <p>Last of all,<note place="margin">4. Difference.</note> there is this difference betweene
them, that hee that hath a perfect heart, hee
that is sound-hearted, while hee is himselfe,
he neuer relapseth into any sinne; marke it,
while hee is himselfe, which note I take
out of <hi>Romanes</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 20.</note> a place which you know:
<hi>It is no longer I, but sinne that dwelleth in mee:</hi>
that is, as if hee should say, I, while I am my

distempered, when I am ouercome, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2062:134"/>
by sinne, that dwelleth in me, then I sinne
and fall backe: But, otherwise, I say, a godly
man, while he is himselfe, neuer relapseth into
any sinne, he cannot sinne, because he is borne
of <hi>God,</hi> he keepes himselfe that the euill one
touch him not; the ground of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,

square himselfe to it, though hee cannot reach
it, yet it is his endeuour, he propounds not to
himselfe a shorter iournies end then hee should
doe, but his ayme is euen at the very toppe of

speakes of, that <hi>wee may be conformable to the

his ayme:<note place="margin">An vnsound heart aymes not at perfect holinesse.</note> whereas, on the other side, another
doth not so, but he sets a certaine compasse, a

hee that hath a perfect heart, hee followes hard

his ayme, but his owne safety, his owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and security, his owne escaping of Hell

doth with it, euen as a lazie scholler doth, that
intends not simply to excell in learning, but
would haue as much learning as should passe
through examination, and get a Degree; or as
a man that labours not simply to get an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
in the Art of Arithmeticke, but would
haue so much only as would keepe a Merchants

booke; or as a Lawyer that would haue so
much Law onely as will serue his turne, as will
serue his practice: I say, when a man aymes
at this, you doe not say knowledge is his ayme;
for were it so, he would desire to know what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is knowable, hee would set no limits to
himselfe, were knowledge his ayme simply:
but we may truly say of such a man, it is not
learning, but it is his trade, his degree, or some
such particular thing, that is his ayme: So it is
with a man whose heart is vnsound, and not
<hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God: God</hi> himselfe is not his ayme,
and therefore he doth not desire to keepe his
Commandements perfectly and exactly; for
did he so, he would set no limits to himselfe; he
would doe as <hi>Paul</hi> doth here, he would ayme at
the vtmost degree of perfection; but such mens
ayme is their owne profit, their owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
their security and deliuerance from Hell
and from Iudgements: that is, they doe not
care for holinesse simply considered, but so far
as it may serue such a turne, as it may deliuer
them from such a Iudgement, as it is a bridge to
lead theem ouer to such a benefit to themselues.</p>
               <p>And the last ground of this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them,<note place="margin">3. He wants light.</note> that they ayme not at the vtmost

he sees not; or, if hee doe discerne it

disallowes it, hee thinkes it a thing more then
needs: Whereas a man that is sound-hearted,
one that is perfect, hee approues it, hee sees an
excellency in it, hee admires it in others, and
would faine imitate it himselfe: and hence is
the difference, that they ayme not at perfection;
it is not their scope, they desire not the vtmost,
the highest degree of holinesse; whereas a man
that hath a sound heart, still he labours to adde

is singlenesse of heart; when wee loue not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2062:140"/>
in word onely, in deed and in truth, when we
loue with a pure loue, such a man, we say, comes
to be perfect with his friend: and so it is in this
case, when a man lookes on <hi>God,</hi> as one that
hath power to doe him good and euill, as one
that hath power to aduance him, or to cast him
downe, and out of these respects he serues him,
and obeyes him, and will doe many things for
his sake; but yet he doth not serue him with a
single heart; that is, he doth not inwardly loue
the person of <hi>God,</hi> he doth not looke on him
as he is seperate from all punishments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as he is sequestred from all such respects,
so as to be hearty to him. This was the fault of
the Iewes; saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they returned againe; but

they desired freedome from the Famine,

they serued the <hi>Lord,</hi> but they did not lay
hold on <hi>God</hi> himselfe, vpon the graces and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Spirit, vpon aeternall life, these were
not the things they did inwardly respect; and
therefore, <hi>God</hi> himselfe they loued not, to him
they did not returne, (as you shall see, because
I will vse that exppession of laying hold vpon
<hi>God,</hi> and vpon aeternall life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 12.</note>) when
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had spoken there of diuers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2062:140"/>
men that were contentious, he puts these two
properties together; they are exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
and couetous, <hi>they reckon gaine godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
but thou,</hi> saith he, <hi>doe not so; but fight the
good fight of faith:</hi> doe not contend with such
a kind of contention, and in such a manner as
they doe: and againe, saith he, when they lay
hold on wealth and preferment, and such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages,
doe thou <hi>lay hold vpon aeternall life.</hi>
I say, this was the case of the Iewes, they laid
hold of such benefits as a carnall man is capable
of, such as indeed they conceiued to come from
the <hi>Lords</hi> hand onely, and therefore they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto him; but they did not lay hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>God</hi> himselfe, vpon aeternall life, vpon the
spirituall priuiledges and promises of grace, and
therefore they returned to him but feignedly;
that is, they did not seeke the face of <hi>God,</hi> that
which is required,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 14.</note> 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 14. If my People
humble themselues, and seeke my face:</hi> that is,
seeke my presence; this they did not: Now
with those that haue sound hearts it is not so,
but they seeke the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe; they are thus
minded, that if they may haue the <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
though they be stripped of all things else,
they doe not much heed it; though they passe
through euill report, though they lose their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
though they bee put in what condition
they can be, yet they are content to haue the
<hi>Lord</hi> aboue for their portion, for they looke on
him as an exceeding great reward: as long as
they may haue his loue, as long as they may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2062:141"/>
haue him, though alone, they care for nothing
else: thus they are affected when <hi>God</hi> puts them
to it, as you see, <hi>Naomi</hi> put <hi>Ruth</hi> and her other
daughter to it, saith shee, Wilt thou goe with
mee? I haue nothing for thee, <hi>Gods</hi> hand is
gone out against me, I haue no more sonnes in
my wombe; or, if I had, thou wouldest neuer
stay vntill they were of age: when they were
put to it thus, one daughter forsooke her, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Orphah,</hi> and returned backe to her people;
but <hi>Ruth</hi> gaue her this answer; Bee it so; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whither thou goest, I will goe, I will dwell
where thou dwellest, I will neuer forsake thee:
So it is with the Saints, they choose the <hi>Lord,</hi>
though alone, they cleaue to him alone, they
reckon it reward enough, if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may haue him,
as you see <hi>Abraham</hi> did, as GOD said to him,
I my selfe will be thy exceeding great reward;
he would not so much as take any thing from
the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi> Why? because, saith he,
it shall neuer be said that hee hath made <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
rich: GOD alone shall make me rich, hee
is reward enough, he is <hi>alsufficient,</hi> I will not
take any of these things in with him: So all the
Saints are thus minded, they are contented
with GOD alone, because they looke on him as
an <hi>alsufficient</hi> reward, they haue a good opinion
of him, and therefore they forsake him not;
whereas others haue beene in admiration of
him, but for aduantage; when they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
what they would haue, and are deliuered
from what they feare, they start aside as a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2062:141"/>
broken Bow,<note place="margin">Hosea 7. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Hosea</hi> 7. the place before named,
as you see <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 12. 1.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 1. Saith the

from following the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 26. 7. 15.</note> And so <hi>Vzziah, 2 Chro.</hi>
26. It is said, the <hi>Lord</hi> helped him vntill hee
was mighty, and what then? when hee had
gotten what he would haue, <hi>his heart was listed
vp to his destruction:</hi> that is, he serued GOD, as it
were, a slippery tricke; then he departed from
him, when hee had gotten what hee desired,
which was a signe hee did not returne to the
<hi>Lord,</hi> or that he did serue him with his whole
heart, but feignedly; he did not seeke the <hi>Lord</hi>
himselfe, he did not seeke his face and presence.
And the ground of all this is, because they haue
no constant fixed good opinion of GOD, but
they thinke well of <hi>God</hi> for fits, and for times, as
we see the <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

GOD for such a time in the Wildernesse, after
hee had refreshed them, and deliuered them;
but as soone as new trouble came, when they
wanted bread, and water, and flesh, presently
they murmured againe, and grew discontented.
And so <hi>Ioram,</hi> King of Israel, when he was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with famine, saith he, I will waite no longer
vpon the <hi>Lord,</hi> but he would needes take away
<hi>Elisha's</hi> head, the man of GOD, that exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e on GOD. Thus it is with men,
they haue no constant good opinion of GOD;
but it is not so with the Saints; they haue
knowne the LORD himselfe, hee hath shewed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2062:142"/>
his owne selfe to them, that good opinion
they haue of him, is fixed and established; it is
the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe that hath taught it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

man, and he that hath a perfect heart, that hee

with him, when another returnes not to the

                  <hi>Howbeit we speake wisdome to those that are perfect,
not the wisdome of this world, or of the Princes of

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rie:</hi>
Heere is another property the Holy Ghost sets
downe of a perfect-hearted man; the Apostle,
when he had said, I come not among you with
the excellency of wisdome, or the words of
man, but my ayme is, my desire is, as to know
Christ crucified alone, so to teach nothing else
to you, and to preach to you in the plaine eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Spirit, and of power; whereas it
might bee obiected, I but <hi>Paul,</hi> euery man
thinkes not so, many men thinke you would
doe better, if you would preach as other men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2062:142"/>
doe, and bee curious and quaint of Oratory:
saith hee, these things, as I deliuer them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they may seeme to other men, yet to
those that are perfect they seeme wisdome;
though others may despise it, and reckon it
foolishnesse, yet to the perfect it is wisdome.
So that, I gather hence, A perfect man in this
is distinguished from another that is not sound-hearted,
that he hath eyes to see the wisdome
of the Holy Ghost, he knowes wisdome. Now
a perfect man is there so called, in opposition
to him that is meerely <hi>animalis,</hi> that hath onely
a reasonable soule, and no more; for that is the
word, the same word that is vsed in another
place of this Chapter, the naturall man, it is
translated, but the word in the Originall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a man that hath onely naturall abilities and
endowments, and naturall perfections, such a
man is reckoned an imperfect man, a man that
is not sound: But, saith the Apostle, to a man
that is perfect, that is, to a man that hath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the strength of naturall gifts, the sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit that enlightneth him, that the Spirit
of <hi>God</hi> possesseth and informes his soule, it
ioynes with his soule, it is dwelling in him; such
a one is a perfect man, saith hee, and you shall
know him by this, hee discernes the wisdome
of GOD, he iudgeth aright of it: so that, my
<hi>beloued,</hi> the meaning of it is this, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
wisdome of <hi>God,</hi> there are certaine things,
that no naturall man in the world reaches or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes:
take the hypocrite, that goes the furthest
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2062:143"/>
in the profession of holinesse, euen as farre as

tasted of the power of the world to come, yet
this wisdome that he speakes of here (we speake

                  </gap>o a man, it exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbles him, all other knowledge doth not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2062:144"/>
so, it rather puffes him vp: But this brings a
man exceedingly out of conceit with himselfe,
it makes him to stand amazed at himselfe; that
is the property of this wisdome, which shewes
it selfe to the <hi>perfect:</hi> and the reason is, because
it is a sanctified discouering wisdome; a wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which that Spirit that giues it, enables
him to make this vse of, that hee vseth it as a
Lanthorue to his feet, as a light to discouer the
crookednesse of his wayes, to finde out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
to which he is subiect, both in his heart
and in his conuersation; therefore this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
discouers him, and opens him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
wheras all the knowledge of any naturall
man, or that any hypocrite hath in `the World
besides, opens him not to himselfe properly,
but rather lifts him vp, he vseth it to reproue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he vseth it for other purposes, he holds it
as a light to other mens feet, he makes not this
vse of it, to search the inside of his owne heart,
he searcheth not euery defect and crannie of
his soule with it, and he findes not out himselfe
what he is. Therefore, you see, assoone as they
haue been enlightned with this wisdome, (<hi>Paul</hi>
and others) how they were confounded in
themselues, how vnworthily they thought of
themselues: that is the property of this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
first to humble.</p>
               <p>Another property is,<note place="margin">2. He knowes things as he ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

yet hee knowes nothing as hee ought to know,
as we see,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 2.</note> 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 2. He that thinkes he knowes
any thing, knowes nothing yet as he ought to know
it,</hi> saith the Apostle; he knowes not sinne as
he ought to know it, he knowes not the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of grace, hee knowes not aeternall life, hee
knowes not these as he ought to know them:
for, did hee; he would bee wrought vpon by
them; if he did know GOD as hee ought, hee
would feare GOD with all his heart, and with
all his soule, and with all his strength; so, if he
did know sinne as he ought, he would make it
his chiefest sorrow, he would abhorre it, hee
would not come neere it, hee would cleanse
himselfe from it, he would flye from it, as from
a Serpent, vpon all occasions: So, did he know
remission of sinnes; hee would not esteeme so
lightly of it as he doth, but hee would seeke it
earnestly, euen as a condemned man doth his
Pardon: So that is the difference; they know
not these things as they ought to know them;
for, <hi>beloued,</hi> this is to bee obserued, when any

that is infused into you, you are able
to discerne betweene good and euill, euen
as the sences doe; (for that is the scope of the
place;)<note place="margin">

                  </note> As the sences discerne betweene colour

an ability in those that are perfest, to discerne
betweene good and euill: so that, take such a
man to whom this wisdome is reuealed, you
shall finde such an aptnesse in him to discerne
betweene good and euill, that is, hee knowes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2062:145"/>
the voyce of the shepheard, hee knowes and
discernes betweene that which is good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
that which is counterfeit; hee knowes
morall goods and euils, what is to bee chosen,
and what to be refused; this he knowes, such a
distinguishing faculty he hath, this is proper to
those that are perfect; the like you shall haue
expressed,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom. 12. be renewed in the Spirit of
your minde, that you may discerne the good will of
God:</hi> that is, that you may distinguish between
the good will that is truly perfect, and that
which is not his will: This property will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a minde that is renewed, he will be able to
discerne what another cannot.</p>
               <p>Lastly;<note place="margin">4. His iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</note> that I may conclude; He, to whom
this wisdome is reuealed, he that is <hi>perfect,</hi> there
is a wondrous change in his iudgement; that
which before seemed foolishnesse to him, now
he reckons it to be the true wisdome; and that
which before was the greatest wisdome, now
it appeares to be follishnesse; as a Child, when
hee is growne to yeeres, and is perfect, the
things that before he magnified, now he disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
them; and the things that before he made
no account of, now they are prized and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
such a difference there is, such a change
in the iudgement, when once this wisdome is
reuealed. So it is in other things: take a yong
beginner in any thing, a young Scholler, hee
indgeth otherwise of the exercise of what hee
learnes, then when he is growne to maturity;
as we see, a man that is vnacquainted with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2062:146"/>
Musicke, that hath no skill in it, the common
tunes like him best; but when hee growes a
skilfull Musician, he cares not for them; those
that haue more perfect Musicke in them, those
he regards, when he hath a more skilfull eare:
so, it is the meaning of the Apostle, <hi>we speake
wisdome to those that are perfect,</hi> as if hee should
say, they are able to discerne things, their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is another kinde of iudgement then yours
is, or then their owne was before; that which
they could finde no relish in, no taste, when
they are perfect once, they finde a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vse in it then others: So that this change
of iudgement, iudging otherwise both of the
persons and of the things, argues they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And this is the last signe, that I will now
name to you, of this property heere spoken
of, <hi>We speake wisdome to those that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
that is, it is the property of those
that are perfect, to reckon that
wisdome to be wisdome
indeed.</p>

properties or adjuncts,
which are not disjoyned from
this sincerity and integrity of
heart: That which wee haue
now to doe, is to shew you the
effects of it,<note place="margin">Effects of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</note> what operation it hath in the heart.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1. It exalteth God.</note> you shall finde this, to be one proper
effect of it, that it teacheth a man to exalt <hi>God</hi>
in all his waies, to lift vp GOD in all his waies,
aboue himselfe, aboue his owne ends, aboue
any thing that tends to his owne happinesse:
for indeed heerein is sincerity of heart seene,
when a man prefers <hi>God</hi> before himselfe in all
things: for hollownesse and vnsoundnesse of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2062:147"/>
heart is in this, when one prefers himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>God:</hi> it is a sure rule, and it is practised by
all the Saints,<note place="margin">Psal. 148. 13.</note> which you haue <hi>Psal. 148. 13,
Thy Name, O Lord,</hi> (saith the Propher there) <hi>is
onely to be exalted.</hi> The meaning is this, when
a man hath any businesse to doe, when he hath
any designe or proiect in his thoughts, he is not
to thinke how hee shall aduance himselfe, or
any end of his owne, but, (saith he) O LORD,
thy Name onely, thy Name onely is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.
Such an expression you shall finde, <hi>Prou.
4. 8.</hi> speaking of wisdome,<note place="margin">Prou, 4. 8.</note> and describing the
sincerity of their hearts that sought it; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by this phrase, <hi>exalt her, and shee shall
exalt thee:</hi> that is, looke not to thy selfe, to the
way that thine owne heart shall suggest to thee,
but what way wisdome and godlinesse shall
propound, exalt and prefer those waies before
thine owne, and let wisdome alone for exalting
of thee, take thou no care for that, exalt her:
And it is a phrase frequently vsed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that <hi>God</hi> is to be exalted,<note place="margin">1. In matter of honour.</note> to bee lift vp;
the meaning of it is this, as when a man takes
another and sets him vpon his shoulders, that
he onely might be preheminent, that he onely
might appeare and bee exposed to view, and
himselfe stand in the croude, and not be seene;
so when a man exalts <hi>God</hi> in all his wayes, that
he may haue aduancement, and honour, and
preheminence, though himselfe appeare to bee
no body; this is to <hi>exalt God,</hi> and this is the
proper effect of sincerity and integrity of heart:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2062:147"/>
another man, whose heart is not sound, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he may exalt <hi>God</hi> in many things, hee
may exalt him in many Commandements, hee
may seeme to seeke him, and to seeke him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
yet he doth all in such a manner that he
may exalt himselfe, and his owne ends aboue
the <hi>Lord:</hi> you shall best see it in particulars;
the <hi>Pharises</hi> did many good workes, but (saith
the Text) <hi>they did them to bee seene of men:</hi> that
is, they had an eye to themselues, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
might be exalted in what they did, that
they might be heard, that they might be seene:
and so <hi>Iehu;</hi> though he were employed in an
honourable seruice, and hee did it diligently,
which was to avenge the quarell of <hi>God</hi> against
the House of <hi>Achab,</hi> and so did it, that he went
through with his worke, yet he had an eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himselfe all the while: <hi>Come and see</hi> (saith
he) <hi>my Zeale for the Lord of Hosts, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee
should say, indeed, I doe all this for <hi>God;</hi> but
he secretly intimates in the speech, before hee
was aware, that it was the appearance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
of himselfe, that he might haue the
praise of the zeale and diligence that he shewed
in the worke, he exalted himselfe. Looke vpon
the Saints now, and you shall see a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
disposition. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> takes this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to himselfe, saith he, let me euen decrease,
that is my condition, I am content to doe so,
and let <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> increase; so he bee exalted
and honoured, I am content to decrease, I am
content to wither in my honour and reputation
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2062:148"/>
which I haue had, so the <hi>Lord</hi> may receiue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
by it: So likewise <hi>Pauls</hi> is an excellent
example,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 5.</note> 2 Cor. 4. 5. saith he, <hi>I doe not preach
my selfe, but the Lord Iesus, and my selfe your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
for his sake.</hi> I doe not preach my selfe; the
meaning is this; saith he, in my preaching, my
ayme is not that I might set forth my selfe, that
men might looke on mee, on my wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, on my
learning, on my eloquence; no, saith hee, I
desire that I might be concealed, as it were, that
I might be obscured and hidden in the World,
and that <hi>Iesus christ</hi> might onely appeare, that
he might be seene, that those that heare mee,
may haue their thoughts and affections carried
to him alone; I am but a spokesman, but the
friend of the Bridegroome, I would haue your
affections bestowed on him, therefore I set
out him altogether; for his sake I am your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and I carry my selfe as a seruant, that still
my Master may haue honour. This <hi>Paul</hi> did,
and thus he exalted the <hi>Lord.</hi> And so <hi>Moses,</hi>
when the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> was poured vpon many
of the people, that they grew vp to some ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of gifts, and so seemed to be more equall
with him, <hi>Moses</hi> seemed to bee obscured by
this meanes, in the opinion of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> who
comes and tels him, Dost thou not see what
these men doe? <hi>Moses</hi> answered againe, hee
was very well contented, so <hi>God</hi> might haue
honour, that himselfe should be somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
and lessened; Dost thou enuie for my
sake? And this is the disposition of all the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2062:148"/>
Saints, that looke what <hi>Ioab</hi> did in the case of
<hi>Rabbah</hi> the City, when hee besieged it, and
was ready to take it, hee sent to <hi>Dauid,</hi> saying,
come thou and besiege it, lest the victory bee
attributed to me; the same the Saints are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
carefull of, that <hi>God</hi> might still haue
the preheminence, that still, whatsoeuer victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they haue, whatsoeuer worke they doe, it
might be attributed to <hi>God,</hi> and not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
this is their constant disposition to exalt
him: Therefore you see how iealous the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were of it, <hi>Act. 3. 12.</hi> when the people
were ready to exalt them for that Miracle they
had wrought, say they, in much indignation,
<hi>Why looke you on vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>as if we by our godlinesse had
done the worke, to make this man whole?</hi> No, say
they, <hi>the Lord hath done it, that hee might exalt
his Sonne.</hi> They were carefull to preferre, and
to exalt him: and herein indeed our sincerity
consists. This is an instance for matter of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that, in any matter of credit, it is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of those whose hearts are vpright, who
<hi>walke before God perfectly, to exalt the Lord,</hi> and
to set him aboue themselues.</p>
               <p>So likewise it is in all matters of aduantage,<note place="margin">2. In matter of profit.</note>
and profit: the heart of an vpright man saith
thus; so <hi>God</hi> and the Church may bee gainers,
it is no matter though I be a loser; so <hi>God</hi> may
haue honour, and his people be saued, and the
worke goe on, and the Gospell may haue free
passage, it is no matter what becomes of mee.
You see, this disposition was in <hi>Moses</hi> and in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2062:149"/>
                  <hi>Paul:</hi> saith <hi>Moses, Let my name be blotted out of
the Booke of life,</hi> let me lose all my reward and
recompence, so the Church of GOD may bee
safe: and so <hi>Paul,</hi> though I bee <hi>separate from
christ,</hi> yet, so the Church of the Iewes may be
safe, so <hi>christ</hi> may be honoured in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of him, and cleauing fast to him, it is
no matter; there is that scope in it. So likewise
<hi>Acts 20. 24.</hi> there is an excellent expression,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 24.</note>
saith the Apostle, <hi>I passe not, my life is not deare
to me, so the ministration be fulfilled, that I haue
receiued, to testifie the grace of GOD:</hi> that is,
though I bee a loser euery way; though my
life be in danger and in hazard, though many
other afflictions may befall me, of diuers kinds,
I passe not for them, so the Ministration may
be fulfilled, so the <hi>Lord</hi> may be exalted, so the
grace of GOD may be testified, I passe not, I
heed it not, I regard it not: When another
man, <hi>beloued,</hi> whose heart is not sound and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
with <hi>God,</hi> saith thus within himselfe, It is
no matter though such a Church, though such
a People, though such a Kingdome, or such a
Nation perish, so I may be safe, so I may enioy
my comforts, my ease, my profit, my liberty,
this in the heart of euery naturall man: But a
man whose heart is perfect with <hi>God,</hi> still exalts
him, both in matters of credit, and likewise in
matter of profit and aduantage.</p>
               <p>Last of all;<note place="margin">3. In matter of pleasure.</note> in any matter of pleasure: He finds
his heart disposed after the same manner; hee
saith thus with himselfe; I care not though
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2062:149"/>
my owne desire of pleasure and ease be crossed,
so men may be pleased in that which is good
for edification; as we see that disposition in
<hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 10. 33.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 33.</note> Saith he, <hi>I please all men in
all things.</hi> Saith hee, <hi>I haue liberty to eate flesh,</hi>
and I desire to vse that liberty, it is as acceptable
to me as to any other, notwithstanding, I will
euen depriue my selfe of that liberty, to please
men; not in this onely, but in all things else;
and why? for, saith hee, <hi>I seeke not</hi> my selfe,
and <hi>my owne profit, but the profit of many, that
they might be saued;</hi> and that is the reason of it:
And why did he seeke the profit of many? We
see in the 31. Verse hee giues this rule, <hi>Whether
you eate or drinke, &amp;c. doe all to the glory of God:</hi>
for this cause, saith hee, I doe not please my
selfe, but others; I please other men in all
things, because I would glorifie <hi>GOD:</hi> that is,
in pleasing them, <hi>God</hi> is aduanced, he is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and exalted: therefore, saith he, I please
not my selfe, but I please others in all things.
So, I say, that is one effect, and the first that I
name to you; That it is the property of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and integrity of heart, to set a man aworke
<hi>to exalt God,</hi> to preferre GOD before himselfe,
in all occasions.</p>
               <p>A second effect arising from sincerity of
heart,<note place="margin">2. effect, Nothing moues a man, but <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> from this perfectnesse of heart, is this; he
whose heart is perfect with GOD, you shall
finde in him this disposition, that he is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to his maine actions ordinarily, but by
vertue of some command from GOD; if hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2062:150"/>
haue not some such motiue, he stands still, and
stirres not. The ground of this is, because while
a man seekes himselfe, while a man is vnsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
while he is full of himselfe, (as euery
man is till he be regenrate, till his heart bee
changed) come and tell such a man, informe
him, and say to him, Sir, this will make for
your profit, or this is for your credit, this will
be for your aduantage, it presently moues him,
and sets him aworke: for his end is to seeke
himselfe,: but let his heart bee changed, and
be <hi>perfect</hi> with GOD, to seeke him, now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
drawne from these respects, doe not so
much worke vpon him; but let a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
come from GOD, let this bee presented
to him, this is the will of <hi>God,</hi> this is for GODS
glorie, this hee will haue performed by thee;
these are the motiues that worke vpon him in
the generall fashion and course of his life: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects, that were most preualent with
him before, they moue him not now; but,
when they are suggested, as in former time, hee
stands still, as it were, as a Ship that is becal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that hath no wind to moue it: but when
a Commandement comes from <hi>God,</hi> that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
fils the Sailes, it fils the faculties of the
soule, that moues it to and fro, that indeed is
the ground, that sets this man aworke, in all
the Actions, and in all the courses of his life.

is, a man of a sincere, of an <hi>vpright</hi> heart, a man
in whose heart is integrity and sincerity, a man
without guile, and he proues it by this, saith he,
<hi>He will doe whatsoeuer I will:</hi> that is, if my will
be known to him, that will he do, that is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
that leades him, that is the thing that stirres
him vpon all occasions: for that is the effect
by which he is described to be a man after <hi>Gods</hi>
owne heart, hee will doe whatsoeuer I will.
Now, beloued, you may examine your selues
by this, whether you haue those effects that
arise from sincerity and integrity of heart;
consider what mooues you to euery action.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2062:151"/>
Certainely there is no man that goes about any
businesse, but there is some motiue that sets him
aworke: Is it by vertue of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that thou goest about all thy occasions?
Is it that that moues thee? Hast thou that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements, that when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commandements come, thou regardest
them little, but thou hast still an eye to that? as
<hi>Dauid</hi> saith, as that is another expression of his
sincerity,<note place="margin">Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 123. 2.</note> saith he, <hi>Mine eyes waite on thee, as the
eyes of the handmaid waite on her Mistris;</hi> that is,
I am still looking to thee, to thy Word, to thy
Commandement, any becke or nod from thee
moues me, as the Maide waits vpon her Mistris,
to see what her will is. I say, this is the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Saints; and therefore take heed
of being deceiued in this; beloued, it fals out
ofttimes, that you shall finde them both impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
and inuolued together, (and therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
we are deceiued;) a Commandement
comes from <hi>God,</hi> and respects of our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre;
(marke it well, that I may take away
this deceipt) as, for example; perhaps there is
a seruice which the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe commands;
a man may bee very diligent in this worke;
but it may bee, there is not onely a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of GOD to mooue him, but
there is much applause, there is a certaine
lustre and splendour that followes diligence,
in a good action, in some great businesse. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re
now is a double motiue; here is a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from <hi>God,</hi> and withall, there is credit
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2062:152"/>
and esteeme from men. As I say of doing, so
likewise of suffering; it may be a man is to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and it is GODS will to haue him suffer, and
he suffers for the keeping of a good conscience;
but withall there is somewhat more mingled
with it, there is esteeme from men: and so for
other actions; diligence in a mans calling, it is
true, is the Commandement of GOD, and the
worke is the LORDS, he doth it for him, hee
ought to be diligent; but withall, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and reputation followes it, there is aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
comes to himselfe; here, you see, there
are more respects then one; here is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of GOD, and other respects like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
and so for hearing the Word; it is true,
it is GODS Commandement to heare, and a
man comes, it may be, out of some respect to
that Commandement; but withall, there may
be other respects mingled; a man may come
to feede his vnderstanding with new notions,
with nouelty, he may come to see wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or to know the humour and the spirit of
the Preacher, other respects may be mingled.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> you will say, how then shall a man
know whether it bee the Commandement that
moues him, if that be the proper effect of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity?</p>
               <p>Beloued,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> it is easie to know it by this; take
a man whose heart is not sound, whose heart is
impure, who is hollow toward the LORD, and
take out the other respects, and leaue the naked
Commandement alone, and he will stand still,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2062:152"/>
hee moues not; let other respects be tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
let the worke want that outward glory,
and he stands still, he goes not about it so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently:
let the suffering bee sequestred from
the praise of men, which accompanies it, let
there be nothing but a bare Command, yea sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
sometimes they incurre discredit with
men, as sometimes they doe, in suffering, there
is onely a naked Commandement to encourage
them to it, I say, if the heart bee vnsound, it
stands still, and moues not: but when the heart
is vpright, take away the Commandement,
and leaue the other respects, and it stands still
on the other side; by which you may know,
that it is not respect to mens commandements
that moues a man, because when that is tooke
out, when there is not the will of <hi>God</hi> signified
in it, when he thinkes with himselfe, this is not
for GODS glory, I haue no warrant from GOD
to doe it, though there be other respects to my
owne credit and profit, the heart stands still,
as a Mill doth, when it hath no water nor no
wind to driue it. This is an argument of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
when still the Commandement moues it.</p>
               <p>But this obiection may be made,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> May not a
man be moued with other respects, may he not
be moued with regard to credit and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that may follow vpon the performance
of good duties?</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> he may in the second place, he may
not primarily be moued with it, it is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2062:153"/>
that must set him on worke; but
when he is vpon the way, these respects may
carry him on with more facility and alacrity:
as a seruant, that is commanded to goe a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
if there be concurrence of other things,
if he haue a good way, and good weather, and
good company, and money in his purse, it is
his aduantage, he doth it the more willingly and
cheerefully; but if there be none of these, it is
enough that it is his Masters businesse, that is
enough to set him aworke. You know <hi>Paul</hi>
had many hard taskes, when he went to <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
and vpon other occasions, you know
what his entertainement was, and yet it was his
Masters worke, it was his Commandement:
for it is a sure rule, that as wee ought to vse all
<hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances, so also may wee vse all <hi>Gods</hi>
Arguments. It is an Argument that himselfe
vseth, that we may haue respect to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<hi>The reward of the feare of God, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
is riches, and honour, and life, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you aske,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> But how shall a man know when
he doth it thus in the first place, when he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with the Commandement?</p>
               <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> you shall know it by this: A ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
that seekes his masters profit altogether,
with the neglect of his owne, it is an argument
that he serues him not out of selfe-respects, but
that which he is primarily moued with, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his Master. Indeed, heere is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
A seruant that trusts not his Master, so
mannageth his businesse, as a Factor that still
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2062:153"/>
hath an eye vpon himselfe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or hee trusts not
his Master: Another, that trusts him, that
thinkes thus with himselfe, my Master is wise
to obserue, and he is willing and able to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that seruant lookes not to himselfe
and his owne ends, but he doth his Masters bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
faithfully, and he cares not so it may be
for his Masters aduantage: for hee loues his
Master, and he thinkes his owne good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
consists more in his Masters then in his
owne; this is that that moues him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without respect to himselfe, he serues him
he doth his businesse faithfully, he lookes what
may be for his aduantage, and not for his owne.
So much for this second effect.</p>
               <p>A third effect that ariseth from this sincerity
or integrity of heart,<note place="margin">3. Effect, He serueth GOD with all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s might.</note> is to serue the <hi>Lord,</hi> to doe
his will with all a mans might, to doe it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
diligently, not onely to haue respect to
his Commandement, but to doe it with all a
mans might and strength: when a man doth it
remissely, it is a signe he doth it feynedly; when
he doth it diligently, it is a signe he doth it with
a <hi>perfect</hi> heart. A seruant, when he slubbers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his worke, and doth but eye-seruice, it is an
argument that hee doth it not with his whole
heart, but feynedly: for when he doth it hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tily,
he doth it painefully, he doth it throughly,
and exactly, and with all his strength. The
ground of it is this, because, when a man doth
any thing truly, and in good earnest, when he
doth it for it selfe, he doth it alway exceeding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2062:154"/>
diligently, they are neuer disjoyned. When a
man doth a thing for a respect, he doth it so far
as that respect requires, so much diligence hee
vseth, and no more: you may see it in other
things; if a man haue money but for his vse,
he will seeke so much as will serue such a turne,
and no more; but if he doth it for money it
selfe, if he loue riches, hee will doe it with all
his might, hee sets himselfe to it with all his
strength. You haue an excellent place for
the expression of this,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 22.</note> in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 22.</hi> saith the
A postle, <hi>Seeing your hearts are purified to loue one
another, without feyning, see that you loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a pure heart, feruently.</hi> The meaning
is this, Let a mans loue be sincere, without fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
let it be with a pure heart, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
without dissimulation, and this property
it will haue, you will loue one another feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Beloued, these cannot be disjoyned, when
one serues the <hi>Lord</hi> with a perfect heart, when
his eye is vpon him, when he doth trust to him,
without any other by-respects, he will doe it
exceeding diligently. Therefore that expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you finde so oft in the Scriptures, <hi>Thou shalt
loue the Lord thy God, with all thy soule, with all
thy heart, and with all thy strength,</hi> it is not an
expression of the degrees of loue; that is not
the sole scope of that place, but it is an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the sincerity of a mans loue; as if hee
should say, herein is the sincerity of a mans
loue, this is an argument that a man loues <hi>God</hi>
truly, and not for respects, when he loues him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2062:154"/>
with all his heart, and with all his might: it is
so in all things; when you doe any thing for
it selfe, you will doe it with all your might.</p>
               <p>Besides,<note place="margin">The intention is deuided, when things are done re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly.</note> there is this further ground of it;
you shall finde this, that all remissenesse, when
a man doth a thing remissely, and ouerly, and
perfunctorily, itargues alway a diuided inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is an argument that the whole minde is
not set on it, but that the intention is distracted,
and bestowed on other things: whence that
common saying is, He that will be excellent in
euery thing, is so in nothing: because his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are diuided. So, <hi>beloued,</hi> you know,
this is the property of sincerity, to haue a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
eye, to haue the heart set vpon one obiect,
to looke to GOD alone; If a man doe so, the
heart is sincere, and he that lookes vpon GOD
alone, he must needs doe it with all diligence:
whensoeuer a man mindes one thing, hee will
doe it with all his might, because all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the intention, the thoughts, and affections
of the soule, they are then concenterate, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
and drawne together into one point, they
are still running in one channell: and therefore
a man that hath a sincere heart, that chooseth
GOD alone, that saith thus with himselfe, I haue
but one Master to serue, I haue but one to feare,
I haue GOD alone to looke to, my businesse is
with him in heauen, I thinke him to be <hi>alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
and <hi>an exceeding great reward:</hi> I say, this
will alway accompany such a heart, such a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
that he serues him with all diligence; if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2062:155"/>
there be any worke of his to be done, hee will
doe it with all his might: for that is the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a mans mind, when once he is able to
say as <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 27. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Psal. 27. 4. One thing haue I
desired of the Lord, and that will I seeke, to see the
beauty of the Lord, to liue in his Temple, &amp;c.</hi>
Why one thing I haue desired, and that will
I seeke with all diligence? when a man desires
but one thing, his minde will be exceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
vpon it; and therefore if you would finde
out now what is a proper effect of sincerity,
you shall finde this alway to be in those, whose
hearts are vpright with <hi>God,</hi> that they giue
themselues vp to his seruice; I say, they giue
themselues vp to do it with all diligence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for a man that saith this, I hope my heart
is vpright with <hi>God,</hi> and yet you see him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
busie with other things, the worke of <hi>God</hi>
he doth ouerly, he slubbers it ouer, he, doth it
negligently, as a seruant that doth eye-seruice;
but for businesses of his owne, he is exceeding
intent vpon them, hee is ouerwhelmed with
them, in following pleasures, and diuers lusts,
his minde is exceeding much taken vp in things
of that kinde; I say, hee doth but dissemble,
when he saith he hath prepared his whole heart
to seeke the <hi>Lord,</hi> that hee walkes before him
perfectly, it cannot bee: a man whose heart
is vpright, hath this disposition in him, that his
speeches, his thoughts and his actions, are still
busied about things that belong to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>God,</hi> holinesse is the element hee liues
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2062:155"/>
in, he would still be doing something <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that way, by his good will he would be doing
nothing else: I say, thus he serues the LORD
with all his might, and that is an argument hee
hath a sincere and vpright heart. You haue a
common saying, when a man doth a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
diligently, he doth it for his life: now
a man whose heart is vpright, his opinion is
changed of his owne happinesse, of his life and
safety; whereas, before, hee conceiued it t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consists in the fauour of <hi>God,</hi> in pleasing him,
and in enioying of him; and therefore when
he reckons that his life consists therein, he doth
exceeding diligently whatsoeuer worke tends
to him, and to his glory. This is the third ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that arriseth from sincerity, and perfection

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2062:156"/>
wanting nothing.</hi> Where you see, that this is
put downe, as an effect that ariseth from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse,
and integrity of heart, when we suffer
the graces of <hi>God,</hi> as patience in particular, to
haue their perfect worke. Now, patience is
said to haue its perfect worke, when it endures
all kinde of tryals: for that is the scope of the
Apostle. <hi>Reioyce</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>when you
fall into tryals of diners sorts:</hi> that is, tryals that
concerne you in soule, in body, in name, and in
state, tryals of euery sort, and euery kinde: if
patience be perfect, (and it will be perfect, if it
be in a heart that is perfect, and entire, it will
haue a perfect worke) it will make vs stay no
where: So that, <hi>beloued,</hi> patience hath then its
perfect worke, when it will suffer any thing, be
it death, be it disgrace, bee it imprisonment, or
pouerty, be it losse of friends, be it what it will
be, afflictions of any kinde; name all sorts of
trouble that you can deuise, if patience haue a
perfect worke, it will beare all of them. When
the heart is sound, <hi>beloued,</hi> then this grace, or
any other, hath a perfect worke: therefore you
see, men whose hearts are not sound, nature
will stand some where; a man perhaps will
beare many things for Religion, but if it come
to death, there he shrinkes; a man will endure
much, but if it come to disgrace, to discredit, to
losse of reputation, there his patience hath not
a perfect worke; and therefore he giues ouer.
As patience must haue a perfect worke, which
is seene in suffering, so likewise it is seene in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2062:156"/>
doing. So you see that expression,<note place="margin">Heb. 17. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb. 17. 1. Seeing we haue such a cloud of witnesses,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>let vs runne the race with patience that is
set before vs.</hi> The meaning of it is this: saith
he, if patience haue a perfect worke, it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you through the whole race to the iournies
end; but if otherwise, a man will runne so far,
or so farre; but when he meetes with such a
rubbe, with such a barre, by the way, there hee
will make a stand, when he comes to thick way,
or to thornie way, or to rough way, there hee
will not runne; and why? because patience
hath not a perfect worke. Therefore, saith he,
runne with patience the race that is set before
you. So, <hi>beloued,</hi> a mans heart is then entire,
when euery grace (I instance now in this) hath
his perfect worke.</p>
               <p>If you obiect;<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> But you see sometimes pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
euen in the best of the Saints, hath not a

               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> it is true, you see it was so in <hi>Iob;</hi>
though he were a man of an vpright heart, (<hi>God</hi>
beares that witnesse to him, hee was a iust man,
one that feared <hi>God</hi>) and likewise this grace was
perfect in him, (as that witnesse is giuen him,

                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 11.</note>

notwithstanding this, it seemed to be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it seemed not to haue its perfect worke. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,</hi>
to this I answer; that it did not rise from
the hollownesse of his heart, or the imperfection
of the grace, but it ariseth many times from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2062:157"/>
some other impediment, some other accident,
from some distemper that may arise in the
soule, that sometime or other may hinder euen
a perfect grace, from hauing a perfect worke;
as you see in the workes of nature, there may
be a perfect Spring, and yet sometimes it may
be hindered from running, by some outward
impediment, it may some way or other be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vp: so, it may be a perfect Drug, fit and
apt enough to worke, and yet some impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there may bee that may hinder it, and
choake it, and dead the vertue of it for a time,
but it is but for a fit; ordinarily, and in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
course, euery grace will haue its perfect
worke; and as I say of patience, so likewise,
you see, in all other graces, (to giue you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instance, the same the Apostle giues there
of faith) faith, when it ariseth, when it dwels
in a heart that is entire, that is perfect, it hath a
perfect worke: when it is otherwise, it workes
but imperfectly, and but by halues. I will giue
you an experiment of it; you shall see two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
examples of it, one in <hi>Amaziah, 2 Chron. 25.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 7, 8, 9.</note> you shall finde there what worke faith had
in him; you see, in the 8, 9, 10. Verses, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>
was to goe to warre against the <hi>Edomites,</hi>
he hyred 100000. of <hi>Israel,</hi> that was halfe his
Armie, to goe and assist him in the battell: there
comes a Prophet from the LORD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tels him,
<hi>Amaziah,</hi> know this, the <hi>Lord</hi> is not with <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
and therefore seperate these men, and send
them home; if thou doe not, thou shalt fall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2062:157"/>
before the enemy: for in the <hi>Lord</hi> there is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to helpe,<note place="margin">Men may doe much, and yet want sauing grace.</note> or to cast downe; <hi>Amaziah</hi>
beleeued the Prophet: so that, you see, faith
had a great worke in him; but saith hee, I am
not able to hyre any more. That is no matter,
(said the Prophet) goe with those thou hast;
and hee was content to doe so, hee went on
to the Battell; and in the next verse, hee was
encouraged to goe on: it was a great worke
of faith, to send backe halfe his Armie, and to
goe on so much encouraged notwithstanding;
yet after, in the same Chapter you shall finde,
though faith went thus farre in him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him through so difficult a case, yet it
had not its perfect worke: for immediately
after hee had ouercome the <hi>Edomites,</hi> hee
set vp their Gods, and a Prophet comes and
tels him, <hi>Amaziah, art thou so foolish, to
set vp the Gods of the Edomites, that were
not able to deliuer their owne people?</hi> Saith
the Text,<note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>hee would not hearken to the Prophet,
but bade him cease, and the Prophet ceased.</hi> So
you see, faith had a worke in him, and a great
worke; but heerein he had an vnsound heart,
as it is said, Verse 2. <hi>hee walked before the
LORD,</hi> in the way of his Fathers, <hi>but not
with a perfect heart.</hi> And you shall finde
this very Storie, that I haue now named,
brought in as an euidence that his heart
was not sound, that his faith had not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
worke: so farre his faith went, thus
far he did by vertue of that faith that he had,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2062:158"/>
but a perfect worke his faith had not. Another
example is in <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro, 11. 2, 3, 4.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. When
the Kingdome was diuided, and giuen to <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
and the tenne Tribes had made that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> hee gathered together
ninescore thousand fighting men to goe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Israel:</hi> but, saith the Text, <hi>the Word of
the Lord came to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
Speake to Rehoboam, the sonne of salomon, King
of Iudah, and to all Israel, and Iudah, and Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
saying, Thus saith the Lord, You shall not
goe vp to fight against your brethren, returne euery
man to his house: for this thing is done by mee.
They obeyed therefore the Word of the Lord, and
returned from going against Ieroboam.</hi> You see
heere a very great worke of faith, that caused
him to giue ouer, to sit downe, to be content to
lose so great a part of his Kingdome, and to
looke no more after it; that, when hee had an
Armie ready of valiant men, yet hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teut
to sit downe; though he were a man that
was not sound-hearted, yet faith had thus farre
a worke in him; and not onely for this time,
but for three yeeres after, hee cleaued to the
<hi>Lord,</hi> and serued him in all things: and yet,
for all this, it had not its perfect worke, it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not through: for afterwards he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the <hi>Lord. Beloued,</hi> this is a signe of
an vnsound heart, when faith shall goe so farre,
when it shall inable a man to doe many things,
and yet for all this, it hath not its perfect work.
Wee see the contrary in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom. 4. 19.</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:2062:158"/>
when he was put to it, when <hi>God</hi> had made him
a promise, that he should be the Father of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations, saith the Text, <hi>he was not weake in
the faith.</hi> The meaning is, he was not vnsound,
but was perfect in the faith. What did he doe?
How did that appeare? Saith hee, hee went
through, when the <hi>Lord</hi> came with such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>hee considered not his owne body, that was
dead:</hi> for hee was a hundred yeeres old; <hi>nor
he considered not the deadnesse of Sarahs wombe:
but</hi> (saith he) <hi>he belee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned that he was able that had
promised.</hi> This is giuen as an euidence of the
truth of his faith; he made not a stand in such a
difficult case: for he was not vnsound, but hee
was perfect in the faith. So likewise, when he
came to offer his sonne; here in the perfection
of his faith was seene. And <hi>beloued,</hi> by this you
may know whether your hearts be right; if you
suffer euery grace to haue its perfect worke,
when your faith doth not picke and choose,
and take heere a promise, and leaue there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
here to beleeue a threatning, another not
to beleeue; here to take hold on a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
to beleeue that this is the will of GOD,
in another case not to beleeue: for so doing
is a signe of an vnsound heart.</p>
               <p>If you obiect,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> But faith many times hath not
a perfect worke in the Saints, as <hi>Moses, at the
waters of strife,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>hee fayled through
vnbeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fe:</hi> and againe, <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee fled
from <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>Achis,</hi> we see his faith there had
not its perfect worke: so likewise, <hi>Peter,</hi> when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2062:159"/>
the waues beganne to arise, to swell, and hee
beganne to sinke, his faith had not a perfect
worke.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> that faith may haue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
worke, that is, there may be an aptnesse in
it, that ordinarily it goes through the worke,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hough, by some accident, it may be hindred:
for (marke the faith of those) wee see <hi>Dauid,</hi>
though he fayled at this time, yet at other times
he did not; no more did <hi>Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Peter,</hi>
which is an argument that it rose not from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundnesse,
from hollownesse of the grace, or
of their hearts:<note place="margin">True grace may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> but from some interueniall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,
some passion; as it was a passion in
<hi>Moses,</hi> he was distempered; and so it was a feare,
a mist that was cast before the eyes of <hi>Peter</hi> at
that time. Now you know a man may bee said
to haue a perfect eye, and yet, for all that, in a
mist he may not be able to see as at other times;
and a man may be said to haue a perfect hand,
and yet a fit of a Palsie may make it shake, and
make it v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fit for any thing: so a man may haue
a perfect taste, able to distinguish one thing
from another, yet when hee is in an Ague, in
such a fit he takes things amisse; things that are
wholsome, seeme bitter to him: so in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Spirit, there may be sometimes much
imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rfection admitted, when a man is in the
mist, when he is in the fit, when some distemper,
some passion or affection, hath ouercast and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerclouded
the soule, as it were, and possessed
he pallate; these may be defects, and yet the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2062:159"/>
grace may be perfect. But you shall know it by
this; ordinarily it is not so, it is but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and therefore it comes to passe but now
and then. And as we say of the grace of faith,
so (to giue you another instance) truth, or the
knowledge of truth: this great grace, if the
heart be sound, will haue a perfect worke; it
will goe through, it will not make a stand heere
and there, as it doth in those that are vnsound,
as you see, <hi>Rom. 1. 18.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> it is giuen there as a signe
of an vnrighteous man, when <hi>they withold the
truth in vnrighteousnes;</hi> that is, when the truth
is not suffered to haue a perfect worke; when
there is truth, and they suffer it perhaps to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their vnderstandings, but they suffer it to
goe no further; when they suffer it not to
walke abroad into all the corners of the soule,
into all the inward roomes of it; or, if they doe
that, yet they suffer it not to come into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Courts of their conuersation, it is a signe
that this grace hath not a perfect worke, but is
restrained: and such an expression you shall
finde,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 5.</note> 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 5. This they willingly know not,</hi>
(marke) <hi>that the heaue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

speakes there of certaine Atheists, that were
<hi>mockers,</hi> and despisers, that were ready to <hi>say,
Where is the promise of his comming? doe not all
things continue alike, since the time of the Fathers?</hi>
The Apostle answers them thus; saith he, they
haue truth in them, there is light enough, GOD
hath borne witnesse to himselfe in their owne
consciences; there are many things that they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2062:160"/>
might obiect against these temptations of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme:
but, saith he, they willingly will not
know them; that is, they will not take them
into consideration; as if hee should say, their
will, because they will not be troubled, because
they will liue loosely, it suffers them not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
and to enquire into these things,
that they might know them; <hi>these things they
willingly know not.</hi> So, beloued, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth hath not a perfect worke,
when there is something that a man willingly
will not know, when a man shall winke with
his eyes, as it is said, <hi>Mat. 13. 15.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>They winke
with their eyes, that they might not vnderstand
with their hearts, and bee conuerted, that I should
heale them. They winke with their eyes;</hi> that is,
when the light shines to them, they will not see
it; when the conscience suggests something,
when there is somewhat intimated, and whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
to the hearts of men, their will runnes a
loose course; therefore they will not suffer
their vnderstandings to be informed, they will
not see all the light: whereas a man whose
heart is perfect, if the light beginne to appeare,
if he see it thorow a creuice, he opens the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of his soule, and lets it in, euen into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
corner of it; and the ground is, because
his heart is sound, he desires to make his heart
perfect, he is not willing to spare it in any thing,
hee desires not there should bee any exempt
place in his heart, or in his life, or any of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2062:160"/>
courses; for he sees, <hi>Ioh. 3. 21.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that deth
euill, comes not to the light:</hi> but hee that loues
the truth, hee whose heart is sound, that is not
an hypocrite, he <hi>comes to the light,</hi> he comes to
be enlightned in what he doth, <hi>hee comes to the
light, that his deeds might be made manifest;</hi> that
is, that it might be euident that his workes are
according to <hi>Gods</hi> will; he desires not that the
light should bee kept off. This is another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Patience will haue her perfect worke,
and the knowledge of the truth will haue its
perfect worke: so I may say of all other graces.
Temperance will haue its perfect worke, if the
heart be sincere and sound; that is, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
euery inordinate appetite, it will cause a
man to for beare euery inordinate delight, euery
inordinate pleasure; it will make him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himselfe from excesse in euery thing, in
dyet, in sports, in ease, &amp;c. So likewise cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
holinesse, and purenesse, it cleanseth the
heart from all kinde of vncleannesse, if it haue
its perfect worke; it suffers none of that leauen
to remaine in soule, or body eyther; neither in
the eye, not in the thought. This is another ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of an vpright heart, of one that is perfect
with GOD, that euery grace hath its perfect
worke: and by this thou maist know, whether
thy heart be sound, or no.</p>

                  </gap>ct, it will make the
heart <hi>peaceable; it is first pure, and then peaceable.</hi>
His meaning is, that peaceablenesse is an effect
of the purenesse and entyrenesse of the heart:
so that, when any mans heart is perfect with
GOD, you shall finde this effect rising from it,
that his heart is quiet, and humble, and gentle,
and <hi>peaceable</hi> towards men; <hi>full</hi> of loue, and
<hi>of mercy, and of good fruits,</hi> and of good actions,
and workes: but when the heart is impure, and
vnfound, and hollow, it is awkward, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and contentious, and implacable towards
men; they are not full of mercy, but full of
wrath; they are not full of good fruites, and
good workes and actions, but they are like the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aging Sea, that casts vp myre and dirt vpon
those with whom they haue to doe. So that
this is the effect of a pure heart, it breeds a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse,
a peaceablenesse of spirit; whereas the
other bring forth tumult, and a turbulent dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
<hi>they are easie to be intreated,</hi> to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
saith the Text; whereas the other, whose
heart is vnsound, they are, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith of the
wicked, they are as thornes, that they cannot

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2062:161"/>
with them, they are not easily intreated. So,
my <hi>beloued,</hi> this frowardnesse, this waspishnesse
of spirit, this implacablenesse, is a signe of an
vnsound heart, of an impure heart, of a heart
that is not perfect with the <hi>Lord:</hi> as you see,
the Deuils are the most impure Spirits of any
other, the most full of malice, and of enuy, and
reuenge, of all other. <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> on the other
side, as he had the most pure heart, so hee was
the most gentle of all others: he returned not
rebuke for rebuke, but <hi>he was as a sheepe before
the shearers, &amp;c.</hi> Vse a Wolfe or a Tyger neuer
so kindely, they will bee still implacable and
greedy; vse Sheepe neuer so roughly, they
will still be meeke and gentle: so it is with the
Saints, because their hearts are pure: I say, the
ground of it is this, because an vnsound heart
breeds in it continually strong lusts, and eager
desires; and eager desires are vnyeelding, and
vnruly, and that is the cause of contention, and
implacablenesse with men: whereas when the
heart is cleansed, when it is pure, and perfect,
it is emptyed of these strong and domineering
lusts, it growes to a quietnesse of spirit; to be
quiet within, and when it is quiet within, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
will bee peaceable towards others without.
When it is quiet thus, the spirit is ready to
see GOD, and to yeeld to GOD in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
in all vnkindnesses, and in all the
euill dealings of men; they are neither ready
to murmur against GOD, nor to fret against
men: for quietnesse followes a pure heart, as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2062:162"/>
vnquietnesse and awkwardnesse and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
followes impurity and imperfection
of heart. So much shall serue

it was written in Tables of stone,

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Difference.</note> this <hi>Couenant,</hi> it brings onely a
seruile feare, and an enmitie; for when a man
lookes vpon the Author of this <hi>Couenant,</hi> &amp; he
heares no more but the Law, and what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires;
he lookes vpon <hi>God</hi> as a hard Master,
as an enemy; againe, he lookes vpon his Law
as a hard and cruell Law, as a heauy yoke, as an
vnsupportable bondage, and therefore he hates

i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and wishes there were no such law; he runs
from it, as a Bond-slaue runnes from his master,
as far as it is in his power. This is that which is
said <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Hagar gendreth to bondage:</hi> that is, the

that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 18.</note> saith the Apostle, <hi>You
are not come to Mount Sinai, to the burning of
fire, to clouds, to darknesse, and tempest, to the
sound of a Trumpet, so that Moses himselfe did
quake and tremble.</hi> That is, when a man lookes
vpon this <hi>Couenant</hi> of workes, it causeth in him
a feare, and an enmitie: that is the 2. difference.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3. Difference.</note> That <hi>it is a ministration of death,</hi>
as it is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. a ministration of death,
that is, it propounds a curse to all those that doe
not keepe it, and it shewes no meanes to auoyd
it; and therefore a man is affected to it, and to
<hi>God</hi> the Author of it, as one is to an enemy that
seekes his destruction; and therefore the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of it is said to be the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death.
The reason of all this is, not because there is any
ill in the Law, it is a ministration of the letter, it
begets feare &amp; emity, it is a ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death;
I say this ariseth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, that the Law of
<hi>God</hi> is a cruell deadly Law: for the Law is good,
but it ariseth from the weaknes and the infirmity
of the flesh: As for example, if you would take
a Pot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers vessell, and dash it against a firme wall;
the reason why the wall is the destruction of the
vessell, is not any infirmity or weaknesse in the
wall, for it is the excellencie and vertue of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2062:166"/>
wall to bee hard, it should bee so; but it is
the weaknesse, and fragility, and brit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lenesse of
the Vessell, and thence comes it to bee broken
asu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der: and so in this case, the reason why this
Law, or <hi>Couenant</hi> of workes (is a ministration
of death, and of enmity, is not because there is
any imperfection in the Law, it ariseth rather
from the perfection of it, but) is from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the flesh, that is not able to keepe the
Law; it is the excellencie of the Law, that it is
so perfect, that a man is not able to keepe it;
and so it ariseth from the weaknesse and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the flesh, that is not able to obserue this
Law.</p>
               <p>Now, on the other side, as this is the <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of workes, so you shall finde that the <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of grace,</p>
               <p>First, is <hi>a ministration of the Spirit, and not of
the letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>a ministration of loue,</hi> not of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<hi>of freedome,</hi> not of bondage; it is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of righteousnesse, as it is there called
the ministration of righteousnesse; <hi>for if the
ministration of condemnation were glorious, much
more shall the ministration of righteonsnesse exceed
in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>a ministration of life</hi> and iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not a ministration of death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
The ground of this, and how it is
thus, we shall shew shew you, by expressing to you,
he order how these depend, and follow one
vpon the other: when a man hath looked vpon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2062:166"/>
the <hi>Couenant</hi> of workes, and sees death in it,
sees a strict Law that hee is not able to keepe;
then come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Couenant</hi> of grace, and shewes
to him a righteousnesse to satisfie this Law, that
himselfe neuer wrought, shewes him a way of
obtaining pardon and remission for the sinnes
that hee hath committed against this Law, by
the death and satisfaction of another; when
he sees this, hee sees withall the goodnesse and
mercie of GOD, giuing this to him, for his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
out of his free grace and mercie; when
he sees this, the opinion of a sinner is changed:
marke; I say, his opinion, his disposition and
affection is altered, he lookes not vpon <hi>God</hi> now
as vpon a hard and cruell Master, but he lookes
vpon him now as a <hi>God</hi> exceeding full of mercy
and compassion; whence this followes, that
his heart melts towards the <hi>Lord,</hi> it relents, it
comes to be a soft heart, that is easie and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it is not haled now to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but out of an ingenuity and willingnesse,
he comes and serues the LORD with alac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse: this disposition is wrought
vpon him, because now hee sees another way,
his apprehension is altered, euen as a seruant,
when it is reuealed to him that he is a sonne, and
that those hard taskes that are laid on him, are
the best way to leade him to happinesse, they
are but rules of direction, for his owne wealth,
and for his owne aduantage, he doth them now
with all willingnesse, the case is altered, hee
lookes not now vpon the Law of <hi>GOD</hi> as an
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2062:167"/>
enemy, or as a hard bondage, but he lookes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the Law of <hi>God,</hi> as a wholsome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
rule of direction, that hee is willing to
keepe for his owne comfort: now when the

will bee expressed to you in these three
things:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the meaning of it is this, looke what
there is in the outward Law, as it is written and
laid before you, there shall be a disposition put
into their heart, that shall answer it in all things,
there shall be a writing within, answerable to
the writing without, that, euen as you see in a
seale, when you haue put the seale vpon the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2062:167"/>
wax, and take it away againe, you finde in the
wax the same impression that was vpon the
seale; you shall see in it, stampe answering to
stampe, character to character, print to print;
so it is in the hearts of the faithfull, after they
are once thus sof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned, the Spirit of <hi>God writes
the Law in their hearts,</hi> so that there is a Law
within, answerable to the Law without, that is,
an inward aptnesse, answering euery particular
of the Law, an inward disposition, whereby a
man is inclined to keepe the Law in all points;
which Law within, is called the <hi>law of the mind:</hi>
therefore, if you adde to this, that <hi>Rom. 7. I see
a law in my members, rebelling against the law of
my minde,</hi> so there is a Law in the mind within,
answerable to the Law of GOD without; it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
it, as Lead answers the mould, after it is
cast into it; it answers it, as Tallie answers to
Tallie, as Indenture answers to Indenture, so
it agrees with it in all things; that is, there is
an aptnesse put into the minde, that it is able,
and willing, and disposed in some measure to
keepe euery Commandement, that answereth
to all the particular Commandements of the
Law of GOD; this is to haue the Law of GOD
written in the minde: and this is that which is
first meant by it, there is a Law within, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the Law without in all things.</p>
               <p>The 2. thing meant by it is, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
put into the mind, as acquisite habits are, but
it is so ingrasted as any naturall disposition is, it
is so rooted in the heart, it is so riuetted in,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2062:168"/>
as when letters are ingraued in Marble, you
know, they continue there, they are not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worne out, and that is meant by it, I will
plant my Law in thy heart, it shall neuer out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
there I will write it, there it shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue:
so that is the second thing that is meant
by it, it shall bee naturall to you; for that is
meant by this, when it is said, it shall bee prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it shall be grauen and written in the heart;
and likewise it shall be perpetuall, it shall neuer
weare out againe, as things that are written in
the dust, but it shall be written so as it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
againe be obliterated.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third thing to be expressed, is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the writing of it; the Apostle here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
himselfe and all other Ministers to the
pen, but it is <hi>Christ</hi> that writes the Epistle, the
Epistle is his, for these workes he doth in it, it is
he that takes the pen, it is he that handles it, and
vseth it, it is he that puts inke into the pen, it is
he that applyes it; so that though the Minister
be the immediate writer of these Lawes in the
heart, yet the inke is the Holy Ghost, and it
comes originally from <hi>Christ;</hi> and besides,
they are not left to themselues, but the LORD
must concurre with them immediately; we are
but <hi>coeworkers with him,</hi> he holds our hands, as
it were, when we write the Epistle in any mans
heart, it is hee that guides the penne, it is hee
that puts inke into it, it comes originally from
him, and therefore the Epistle is his. Besides,
this is further to bee considered in this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2062:168"/>
that <hi>God</hi> will write his Lawes in our
hearts, that we may see these Lawes, wee may
reade them, and vnderstand them: for when a
thing is written, <hi>God</hi> may see it, and man may
see it; a man himselfe may see it, and others
also may reade it: <hi>God</hi> sees it himselfe, for he
hath written it: man sees it, for hee is able to
see the Law in his minde, he is able to see that
habituall disposition that is infused into him:
and others are able to see it; for, saith he, you
are our Epistle, <hi>euident to all men;</hi> that is, they
see the fruits and effects of it, as you may see
letters grauen in stone, so they see this Law
written in your hearts. So, <hi>beloued,</hi> you see
now what this <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace is, and how it
differs from the <hi>Couenant</hi> of Workes; it is the
ministration, not of the letter, but of the Spirit,
because it doth not onely present the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tward
letter of the Commandement, but there is a
Law written within, and that is done by vertue
of the Spirit. So that the order is this; first,
it reueales righteousnesse; secondly, it softens
the heart, it is the ministration of the Spirit; and
thirdly, it is a ministration of loue, it is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of freedome, and not of bondage and
enmity: for when the Law is thus written,
a man is not haled to it, he comes not to it as a
bond-slaue, to doe his worke, but hee comes
willingly, he finds he hath some ability to doe
it, he findes a delight in it, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I delight
in the Law of God according to the inward man.</hi>

a larger effusion of the Spirit, there is
more cleerenesse, as we see, <hi>Heb. 8. 10.<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 10.</note> After

The meaning of it is this, the promises
which were made in the Old Testament,
(though the promise of saluation was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
yet) the maine of them, the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
and insisted on, were, they should haue

prosperity, you see the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t much
insists vpon that; the New Testament meddles
little with them, but with promises of saluation,
remission of sinnes, sanctification by the Spirit:
therefore, saith the Apostle here, it is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
vpon better promises. And againe, there
is a larger effusion of the Spirit, the Spirit is
now powred on vs in a greater measure, then
it was distilled by drops, now the <hi>Lord</hi> hath
dispensed it in a greater abundance to the sons
of men, in the time of the Gospell, there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure of grace, and it followes vpon the

because there was more truth, and more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
there went likewise more grace with it;

                  <hi>I know thy pouerty, but

this is the great riches; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
exhorts rich men, that they-change these

Now a man will neuer be exhorted to change,
except it bee for the better. <hi>Charge those that
are rich in the world, that they bee rich in good
workes:</hi> let them so vse their riches, so dispense
them, so mannage them, that they may turne
to other riches. When a man is rich in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2062:174"/>
as it is said of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they
were rich in all knowledge, and in euery grace,
These are the better promises, this is the better
and more glorious condition. So that, if there
should be a <hi>Census</hi> of men, as one may so say, if
there should be an estimation of men, as there
was wont to bee amongst the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they
were put into seuerall conditions, and one was
worth thus much, and another so much. Indeed,
If <hi>God</hi> should make such a <hi>Census;</hi> as euery man
is richer in grace, as hee excels in these better
priuiledges, as he hath had these better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
fulfilled more or lesse to him, so hee should
bee reckoned a more excellent man, and so
should euery man esteeme both of himselfe and
others: and there is very great reason for it;
because when a man is rich in grace, rich in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

prospers, that is his best condition; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
his soule prospers best, when his outward
estate fares the worst: the winter of his outward
condition is vsually the spring time of his soule;
we should learne to iudge thus. You know, it
is an obseruable thing, that the promises of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
prosperity were made to the Church of
<hi>God,</hi> whiles it was yet in its infancie, while it
was weake; so that this you may obserue from
it, that it is a signe of childishnesse, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and infirmity, that a man is not growne
perfect, that he is not growne to maturity, to
thinke outward prosperity to be the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
The Iewes had these promises, but in
regard of their infancy, and when the Church
grew vp to a greater height, when it grew to
manbood (as it were) we haue little mention of
any such promises as these; the promises are
quite of another nature; and therefore when
you are able to outgrow those opinions, when
you are able to looke on things with another
eye, when you thinke this outward prosperity
to be but a trifle, in comparison of the better
promises, it is a signe you are growne vp to
more strenght. You see, <hi>Salomon,</hi> when hee
came to himselfe, when his wisdome returned
to him, (as I may so say) you see how he looked
on all outward things, how he goes through all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2062:176"/>
the particulars, they are vanity and vexation of
spirit. <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he was old, when he had
the wisdome of experience ioyned together
with that infused wisdome that hee had from
the Holy Ghost, made this the summe of all,
that outward prosperity is meere vanity, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
vanity, a vanity that hee could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
expresse, and only he magnifies these
better promises; this hee magnifies as
the better condition, to <hi>feare God

of freedome, the ministration of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2062:177"/>
and the ministration of life: then, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
we may gather this from it, that if a man
will obtaine the Spirit, and thereby mortifie the
deeds of the body, if hee would bee deliuered
from the bondage of sinne and of death; then
let him make vse of, and apply to himselfe the
Couenant of Grace, the free promises of the
pardon and remission of sinnes, let him apply
them, that is the way to get the Spirit, that is
the way to mortifie the deeds of the flesh, that
is the way to get his heart changed, that is the
way to be made a new creature. For the better
vnderstanding of which, this is to he obserued,
that which keepes euery man off, that which
keepes men in a condition of strangenesse from
the life of <hi>God,</hi> is, because they see such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the commandements of <hi>GOD,</hi> as they
are not able to keepe, when they looke vpon
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and on the stubbornnesse of
their owne hearts, and the indisposition that is
in them to yeeld obedience, they thinke there
is no hope, and therefore they neuer goe about
it: for they see the Commandement, and they
finde in their owne heart no disposition to keep
it, but an aptnesse to rise in rebellion against it;
I say, this keepes men off from the life of <hi>God:</hi>
But, on the other side, when a man lookes vpon
the promises, he begins to see the <hi>Couenant</hi> that
his sinnes shall be put a way, he beginnes to see
the goodnesse, and the mercy, and the tender
compassion of <hi>God</hi> towards him; hee begins to
see a possibility of fulfilling the Law, in such a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2062:177"/>
manner as GOD now requires; then his heart
melteth, hee becomes not onely applyable to
the Commandement, but is ready to delight in
it; this a man gets by applying his heart to the
Couenant of grace, or by applying the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace to himselfe; that very applying
of the promises of forgiuenesse, I say, it begets a
disposition in the heart, which the Scriptures
call a new life; that euen as you see the Sunne,
when it applies its beames to a fitly disposed
matter, and stayes vpon it, when it pitcheth its
beames vpon it with any continuance, it begins
to beget life and motion in it, and makes it a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
creature: so doth the Couenant of Grace,
when it is applyed to the heart of a man, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to beget life in him, and to make him a
new creature, it makes him another man: there
is that power in the Couenant of Grace, in the
promises of the pardon and forgiuenesse of sins,
that it begets another life in a man, it makes him
a new creature, it makes him a liuing creature
to GOD, which before he was not; the ground
of which you shall see, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 6.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> Hee hath
made vs able Ministers of the New Testament,
not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter
kills, but the Spirit giues life.</hi> Marke it, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it is this, when the Couenant of works
is deliuered to you, that is, when you heare the
Law, the Commands, the duty you cannot
performe, there is no more deliuered to you but
the bare letter, that is, you know the duty, and
no more. And what doth this duty doe? what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2062:178"/>
doe these Commandements and precepts doe,
when they are applyed to the heart of man?
Saith hee, they kill. Now that which kills,
fights before it kills, and that which fights must
needs be an enemy: so then the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is an Enemy, that is, euery man esteemes
it as an enemie to himselfe, and therefore hath
an enemy-like affection to it againe; that is, he
hates it, he would be rid of it, he wisheth there
were no such Law or Commandement, hee
desires it should be dealt with as he would haue
an enemy dealt with, he would haue it vtterly
taken away; when they grow in enmity one
with another, as indeed they doe, the naked
Commandement and the heart are at enmity:
for the Commandement would haue one
thing, and the heart would haue another; there
are contrary wils, and there is a striuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, the one striuing this way, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that way, the one resisting the other, and
in the end, the Law and the Commandement
gets the victory; because the sting of the Law
is sinne: now the Law is the cause of sinne, as
a straight Rule is the cause of crookednesse; for
without the Law there should be no sin: now
it causeth sinne; for if there were no Law,
you know there could bee no feare, no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;
because there could bee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which the transgression should come, this
sinne is the death of a man, so now the letter
kils: But come now to the Couenant of Grace,
saith the Text, <hi>it is the ministration of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:2062:178"/>
and the Spirit giues life; that is, when a man
lookes on the <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace, he lookes not
on it now as an enemy, as hee did before vpon
the Commandement, but he sees in it much
loue, and much friendship to wards him; he sees
<hi>God</hi> intends not any hurt, any euill to him, as
he apprehended before; he sees <hi>God</hi> exceeding
kinde, and mercifull, and willing to put away
all his sinnes, and willing to accept the sincerity
of his obedience, though there be not a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of obedience; now he begins to change
his opinion, both of <hi>God</hi> and of all his Lawes,
and precepts; when he sees <hi>Gods</hi> kindnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and his compassion and readinesse
to forgiue him, then his heart begins to relent
towards the <hi>Lord</hi> againe, he begins to magnifie
<hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse, and to condemne himselfe, he
beleeues those promises, and thence he growes
vp in loue toward GOD; I say, hee growes vp
in faith, and loue, and in this act of faith is the
Spirit infused into his heart; this Spirit being
thus infused, writes the Law in his inward

that inables him in some measure to
keepe the Law, it prints in him all those graces
that giue him strength to obserue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
that <hi>God</hi> hath given him: so, my
beloued, if a man will goe about this great
worke, to change his heart, and to change his
life, let him not goe about it as a morall man;
that is, let him not onely consider what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
there are, what the rectitude is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2062:179"/>
that the LORD requires, and how to bring his
heart to it; but let him goe about it as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that is, let him beleeue the promises of
pardon in the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
of those promises, will be able to clense
and purge the heart from dead works: (in that
place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we then named, and we could doe no
more but name it) you shall finde it, <hi>Heb. 9. 14.</hi>

by the eternall Spirit offered himselfe without fault
to God, purge your consciences from dead workes, to
serue the liuing God.</hi> The meaning of it is this,
when a man hath once applyed the blood of
<hi>Christ</hi> for his iustification, this effect will follow
vpon it, there will accompany it a certaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
a certaine vertue, a certaine power and
strength, which will also purge his conscience
from dead workes; that is, there shall goe a
power of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> together with this
blood, that shall not onely forbid him, and
shew him that hee ought not to doe such and
such euill things, but it shall clense his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from those rootes of dead workes, those
corrupt lusts, and sinfull affections, that are in
him, that dispose him to that euill; he shall find
this power growing vpon him, if hee doe but

of pardon and forgiuenesse through the blood
of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> The like you shall see, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 5.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some extraordinary manifestation of the Spirit;
saith the Apostle, when this was done, was it
done by the preaching of the Law? was it not
done by the preaching of <hi>Christ,</hi> and by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to you the pardon and forgiuenesse of sins

how doth hee worke these miracles? hee doth
them not by the workes of the Law, but by the
hearing of faith preached; that is, by our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

best way to get a greater measure of the graces
of the Spirit, to grow vp to greater holinesse of

the beliefe of those promises of the Gospell:
for there is no other reason in the world, why
in the New Testament there is an infusion of
the Spirit that giues life, but because now there
are more euident promises of pardon, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse,
and reconciliation with GOD, which
by the Couenant of workes could not be. And
so much shall serue for this.</p>
               <p>The fourth,<note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> and maine Vse, that wee are to
make of this, from this description of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,
is to learne to know the ground vpon
which we expect saluation, and the fulfilling of
all the promises; the ground of all is this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.
My beloued, it is the greatest point
that euer we had yet opportunity to deliuer to
you, yea, it is the maine point that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Gospell can deliuer at any time,
neither can they deliuer a point of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor can you heare any, then the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Couenant of Grace: this is that
you must lay vp for the foundation of all your
comforts, it hath beene the corner stone vpon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2062:181"/>
which the Saints haue beene built, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, vnto this day: there is
no ground you haue to beleeue you shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
there is no ground to beleeue that any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>God</hi> shall be made good to you, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that you shall haue the price of the high
Calling of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Riches of the inheritance prepared for vs in
him; I say, there is no other ground at all, but
vpon this Couenant; all that wee teach you
from day to day, are but conclusions drawne
from this Couenant, they are all built vpon
this: therefore, if euer you had cause to attend
any thing, you haue reason to attend to this; I
say, this Couenant betweene GOD and vs.
And therefore we will labour to open to you
now more cleerely, and distinctly, this Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
though a difficult thing it is, to deliuer to
you cleerely what it is, and those that belong to
it; yet you must know it, for it is the ground
of all you hope for, it is that that euery man is
built vpon, you haue no other ground but this,
<hi>GOD</hi> hath made a Couenant with you, and
you are in Couenant with him: therefore, that
I may shew it to you, we will proceed from the
very first preaching of the Couenant to <hi>Adam.</hi>
When the Serpent had ouercome the Woman,
and supplanted her and the Man, and had
throwne them from their happinesse, <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
first preached the Gospell to them, and
that in these termes, after he had charged them
with their sinne, and had humbled them, (for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2062:182"/>
that method he vseth) he sheweth <hi>Eue</hi> what
she had done, and saith to <hi>Adam, Hast thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the tree, of which I said thou shalt not eate?</hi>
he shewes them their sinne, and after that the
curse; then he begins to tell them hee will not
leaue them without hope; it is true, saith hee,
the Serpent is your enemy, and hath ouercome
you; but, saith hee, you shall not bee slaues to
him, and captiued to him for euer; but you
shall resist him, and be an enemy to him, <hi>I will
put enmity</hi> betweene the Serpent and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and you shall fight together, there shall be
a warre betweene you, and this shall bee the
issue of the warre, the Serpent shall afflict you,
and hurt you something, but thou shalt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, and bruise his head, thou shalt bee
the death of him, thou shalt haue the victory
ouer him. The Woman might aske, But how
can this bee? Alas, I am weake, I finde my
selfe too weake already in the Battell, he is too
strong for mee? Saith hee, I will giue thee a
certaine <hi>seede,</hi> one that shall bee borne of thee,
and he shall be an enemy to the Serpent and his
seede; that is, to all euill men, that are called
his seede, because they are like him: there shall
bee enmity betweene them two, and hee shall
fight the Battrell for thee; and in that Battell
betweene him and the Serpent, this shall be the
issue, the Serpent shall <hi>bruise his heele,</hi> that is, he
shall preuaile so farre as to cause men to crucifie
him, which is but as the bruising of the
heele; but, saith he, he shall <hi>breake his head,</hi> he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2062:182"/>
shall vtterly destroy him, and ouercome him
for thee: so thou shalt preuaile againe, and be
set in the place, and enioy all the promises.
The Church continued in the vertue of this
promise, this preaching of the Gospell, vntill
<hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and then <hi>GOD</hi> beginnes to
manifest his Couenant againe; hee calls forth
<hi>Abraham</hi> and tells him he meanes to make a
Couenant with him, he tells him that hee will
blesse him, and that all the Nations of the
world should bee blessed in him: one while it
is said thus; another while, <hi>all the Nations of
the Earth shall be blessed in thy seede.</hi> Beloued,
there are many difficulties in this, how the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
should be made to the seede? how againe
it should be made to <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe? (for
it is said to be made to both) how all Nations
are blessed in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet it is said, they
shall be blessed in thy seed?</p>
               <p>Againe, the condition of the Couenant,
which he requires of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the same
thing that <hi>God</hi> makes a part likewise of his own
Couenant.</p>
               <p>Besides, GODS Couenant seemes not to
bee the giuing of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the promised Land, giuing him a sonne, and
making him a great Nation; many difficulties
there are in this: Therefore, that you may
vnderstand them distinctly, I will deliuer
it thus to you; not in the method wherein
it is set downe, but so as I shall make it much

question is, how this shall be done? Saith the

that the people euer had, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
to them by these three, by their Priests,
by their Prophets, and by their Kings: saith
he, this promise I haue made to that seede, that

saith he, that seede of mine that I shall send,

what was the blessing that <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>
brought to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Saith hee, The LORD
blesse thee; he blessed him, that is, hee bade
him goe on, and prosper, hee wished that all
blessings might come vpon him, that he might
ouercome his enemies, &amp;c. that hee might
haue blessings of all sorts, they are not set down
particularly; and in a word, hee made him
heyre of all things: for, saith he, I am the Priest
of the most high <hi>God,</hi> possessor of Heauen and
Earth, and heere I haue brought thee Bread
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2062:184"/>
and Wine, that is, an earnest, a little for the

shalt giue him the tenth of all thou hast, that is,
by that thou shalt shew thine homage, thou
shalt shew that thou art bound to yeeld him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
thou shalt shew vpon what tenure
thou holdest all that thou hast; thou giuest him
that as a rent, acknowledging him to bee the
<hi>Lord,</hi> of whom thou hast receiued all things,
and to whom thou owest all things: therefore
<hi>Abraham</hi> would take nothing of any else, hee
would take nothing of the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi> nor
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2062:184"/>
he would doe nothing for the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi>
that is, not to him, nor any man, but as from
<hi>God,</hi> as a meanes vnder him. Beloued, this is the
great <hi>Couenant</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
So you see how the promise is made to
the seed: for the promise was made thus to the
seed, <hi>God</hi> had promised that hee should bee a
King, a Priest, and a Prophet, <hi>I haue sworne,</hi>
saith he, <hi>thou art a Priest for euer, after the order
of Melchizedeck:</hi> againe, <hi>I will giue vnto him
the Kingdome of Dauid.</hi> Thus the promises
come after in the Old Testament: So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is made to the seed, and againe it is the
seede that blesseth him. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p>Now for the Condition that <hi>God</hi> required
of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. The Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, which is faith.</note> it was this, Thou shalt beleeue
this, thou shalt beleeue that such a <hi>Mesiah</hi> shall
be sent into the World: Art thou able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
this, <hi>Abraham?</hi> He answers, Yes. Well,
saith the <hi>Lord,</hi> I will put thee to the tryall, I
will see whether thou canst beleeue this, or no;
and, withall, I will giue thee a signe or euidence
that I am able to performe it: saith he, I will
giue thee a Sonne: It is true, thou art as a dead
man, thou art almost a hundred yeeres old, and
the wombe of <hi>Sarah</hi> is dead: I will promise
thee a Sonne, art thou able to beleeue it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
thou seest the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> thou hast
not one foot in it, I will giue this land from the
length and breadth of it, for thy possession:
Art thou able to beleeue this? saith the Text,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2062:185"/>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did beleeue, and <hi>God accounted</hi> that
<hi>faith</hi> of his <hi>for righteousnesse;</hi> that is, hee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him for it: for that faith he reckoned him a
man fit to make a <hi>Couenant</hi> with all, hee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him a righteous person; that is, hee was
willing to enter into <hi>Couenant</hi> with him, because
he beleeued him. Beloued, this was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
the beleeuing of the <hi>Mesiah,</hi> (he did not
intend the <hi>Mesiah)</hi> but it was the beleeuing that
he should haue a sonne. You see, the Text is
plaine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. when <hi>God</hi> had said to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
that hee would bee his <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi>
saith <hi>Abraham, I goe childlesse, and the Steward of
my house will be my heyre.</hi> Saith the LORD to
him, Verse 4. <hi>This man shall not be thine heyre,
but one that shall come out of thine own bowels shall
be thine heyre.</hi> Goe looke vpon the Starres, if
thou be able to number them, then thou shalt
number the seed that thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shalt haue. Saith the
Text, Verse 6. <hi>Abraham beleeued, and hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
that to him for righteousnesse</hi> So likewise
he addes, in the Verses following, againe hee
said, <hi>I am the Lord that brought thee out of
Vr of the Chaldees, to giue thee this Land to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it.</hi> So, my beloued, this was the promise.
Now, when <hi>Abraham</hi> had beleeued this, saith
the Lord to him, This faith of thine, that is, not
this particular act by which thou beleeuest that
thou shalt haue a sonne, that shall be thine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
heyre, but that habit, that grace of
faith, that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>leeuing disposition in thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thou art able to beleeue this promise, saith
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2062:185"/>
he, with the same faith thou also belieuest the
promise of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that a certaine seed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
shall be giuen thee, in whom all the Nations of
the Earth shall be blessed. Saith he, this faith
of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e I take for the condition of the <hi>Couenant</hi>
on thy part, I will for this reckon thee as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
I will account thee as a man fit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Couenant withall. Againe, the <hi>Lord</hi>
tryes him afterward, when <hi>Isaac</hi> was growne,
Verse 22. Goe, saith hee, and kill thy sonne:
<hi>Abraham</hi> was able to keepe it, hee went, and
meant to haue done it in good earnest; so there
was the same ground for beleeuing now, that
there was before: So, saith hee, GOD could
haue raised him from the dead when I had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, aswell as make mee, when I was dead,
and <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe, when that was dead, to
bring forth a sonne: <hi>God</hi> can aswell raise him
from the dead, as he could giue him mee from
a dead wombe at first. Wee see, that <hi>God</hi> vpon
this renewes the <hi>Couenant</hi> againe, and renewes
it with an Oath; sure, saith he, I will performe
my <hi>Couenant,</hi> since I see that thou beleeuest, and
fearest mee, and preferrest me before thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne: these are but the concomitants of
his faith. So, my beloued, it was this act of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> by which hee did beleeue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>God,</hi> that made him partaker of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</hi>
And if you aske now what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that makes euery man partaker of this
<hi>Covenant</hi> of grace? It is nothing but onely
faith, ability to beleeue it, that <hi>GOD</hi> would
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2062:186"/>
send such a <hi>Messiah,</hi> before the Law, and
that hee hath exhibited, and sent him since:
for you must know this, that all the promises,
the very giuing of <hi>Isaac,</hi> the giuing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Land, all these were but shaddowes, as it
were, of the great promise, of the maine <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
in <hi>Christ.</hi> So likewise, that act of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
faith, whereby hee beleeued that he
should haue a sonne, and beleeued that <hi>GOD</hi>
would giue his children possession of that Land
where he had not a foot, was but likewise a
branch, and a shaddow, and a pledge, as it
were, of the maine act of faith, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
the promised seed should be giuen him,
in whom himselfe, and all the Nations of the
Earth should bee blessed. So then wee haue
found out this, what the Condition is that <hi>God</hi>
requires of euery man to bee made partaker of
his <hi>Couenant;</hi> it is nothing but to beleeue in
<hi>God;</hi> that is, <hi>God</hi> saith, I will giue my Sonne
to you; <hi>to vs a Sonne is giuen, &amp;c.</hi> that shall be
the promised seede, and I will make him a King,
a Priest, and a Prophet, to blesse you; hee
shall giue you remission of sinnes, &amp;c. he shall
teach you, and instruct you to mortifie your
lusts, and shall make you partakers of his
Kingdome; he shall make you heyres, and
sonnes; this is a very great promise, can you
beleeue this? If a man will but beleeue GOD
now, I say, it makes him partaker of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,</hi>
this puts him within the <hi>Couenant:</hi>
you will say, this is very strange; how can it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2062:186"/>
be, that so small a condition as this, that to
bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eue, should make a man partaker of the
<hi>Couenant?</hi> that vpon which all the promises
hang initially, is nothing but beleeuing. You
see <hi>Abraham</hi> did no more but beleeue GOD,
when hee told him hee should haue a sonne,
you see how much GOD made of that: So
it is with vs, if we doe but beleeue this, <hi>God</hi>
will make as much of it, he will make good all
the promises of the <hi>Couenant</hi> to vs: But, I say,
this hath need of a reason why it is suspended
onely vpon faith, and beliefe; the reason is
this, marke it well,<note place="margin">Reasons why faith is the Condition.</note> it is a point of exceeding
great moment.</p>
               <p>First, though there were nothing but faith,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
yet that beleeuing brings with it, and workes
sanctification, and holinesse of life: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you might object, May a man beleeue this
promise, and yet walke according to the lusts
of his owne ignorance, and so to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the <hi>Couenant?</hi> Let him, if he can beleeue
truly, and doe this, but it is impossible, let him
beleeue, and the other will follow. Behold
<hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe, (to giue you an instance
of it) he beleeued GOD, and it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him for righteousnesse; I say, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for him to beleeue GOD: For that
drawes after it inherent righteousnesse of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and holinesse of life: for, saith the
Text, <hi>Rom. 4. Abraham</hi> is said to beleeue
GOD, when hee said he should haue a sonne,
he gaue him glory, that is the ground, which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2062:187"/>
drawes with it all other graces, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
he that beleeues GOD, hath a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of him, hee loues him; hee that loues
him, must needs be full of good workes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
he that beleeues him, when GOD shall
say to him, <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward,</hi> see
that thou keepe close to mee, thou shalt haue
an eye vpon mee, and walke with mee from
day to day. Let a man beleeue that GOD is
<hi>alsufficient,</hi> that he will be <hi>a Sunne and a Shield</hi>
to him, and his <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> hee will
be ready to doe it. <hi>Abraham</hi> did so, when <hi>God</hi>
called him from his Fathers house, and from
his kindred, hee was ready to doe so; when
GOD would haue him to offer vp his onely
sonne, he was ready to doe it: for he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
GOD, hee beleeued his promise, and his
ability, and willingnesse to helpe him; hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
his Almighty power, and therefore
whatsoeuer GOD bid him doe, he would doe
it; hee preferred GOD before his own ease,
before his owne profit, before his onely sonne
whom hee loued: Let any man beleeue as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
did, and of necessity it will produce
good workes; let a man beleeue truely, and
truth of beliefe will bring forth truth of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and therefore wee heare what S. <hi>Iames</hi>
saith, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Abraham was iustified by
faith;</hi> it is true: but, saith hee, <hi>Abrahams</hi>
faith had workes ioyned with it: for it was
not a dead, a counterfeit faith, but a true faith,
and being a true faith, you see, <hi>Abraham</hi> had
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2062:187"/>
workes aswell as faith: for when <hi>GOD</hi> bade
him offer his sonne, he did it: Was not that
an exceeding great worke? saith the Apostle
there: So say I, no wonder that it is by faith,
that the LORD requires no more but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
for when a man beleeues, workes will
follow, it will breed holinesse of life; let him
beleeue GOD to bee an exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that hee is a Sunne and a Shield, he will
follow GOD wheresoeuer hee leades him; let
him beleeue the promise of GOD, when he
describes himselfe, hee must needes haue a
good opinion of him, and loue him, and bee
exceeding fruitfull in good workes, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him; therefore that is one reason for
it.</p>
               <p>A second reason of it is,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> because it could not
bee done by obedience to the Law; it was
impossible to haue made the sonnes of men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> that way: for if it
could haue beene done by the Law, and by
the Commandement, it should haue beene;
but the LORD tryed that in <hi>Adam,</hi> hee
gaue <hi>Adam</hi> a Commandement, and ability
to keepe it, (so hee made him perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,)
yet <hi>Adam</hi> did not keepe it. Put
the case that GOD should haue tryed him
the second time, and haue giuen him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
againe, and not haue required the
Condition of faith, but of obedience, hee
would haue broken it, as hee did before; and
therefore it could not bee by the Law: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2062:188"/>
it must needes bee by faith, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
otherwise it could neuer haue beene
sure. <hi>Adam</hi> brake it; surely, if hee brake
it, we should haue broken it, if it had beene
any other way but by faith: and therefore
wee see what the Apostle saith, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 21.
<hi>Is the Law then against the promise of GOD?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21.</note>
                  <hi>GOD forbid: for if there had beene a Lawe
giuen that could haue giuen life, surely rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>teous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
had beene by the Law:</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had stood
and had kept the Law, and if men could haue
entred into Couenant, and haue kept it, <hi>Christ</hi>
had beene spared, the Couenant of Grace
had beene spared; if righteousnesse had beene
by the Law, there had needed no <hi>Messiah,</hi>
there had needed no Couenant of Grace;
and therefore, <hi>through the infirmity of the flesh,
(Adams</hi> flesh, that would not keepe the Law,
and ours, that is not able to keepe it) there
was no other way to make mankind partaker of
the Couenant of Grace, but onely by faith,
by beleeuing GOD, and by taking the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and the gift of Righteousnesse, through
<hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> for it could neuer else in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
haue beene <hi>sure to the seede.</hi> This is
the way to make it sure, when there is no more
but an ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eptation required, and not exact o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Commandement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> it is by faith: because nothing
else can answer the Couenant, but faith: you
see, the Couenant is not a Commandement,
<hi>Doe this, and liue,</hi> but the Couenant is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2062:188"/>
I will giue thee, It runnes all vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<hi>I will giue thee a seed, and in that seede
thou shalt bee blessed. I will giue thee this good
Land, &amp;c.</hi> so that the <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace
stands on GODS part all in promises: Now
you know that it is faith that answers the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
for the promise is to beleeued; if the
<hi>Couenant</hi> had stood in precepts, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
and rules of the Law, then it must
haue beene answered by workes, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and therefore it could not be by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
for that holds not proportion, there is
not agreement betweene them; but since
the Couenant consists of promises, that
must needes bee by beleeuing, and not by
workes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> and lastly, it is by faith, because
the <hi>Lord</hi> would haue it by free grace, and not
of debt: for, saith hee, If I should giue a
Law, and rules to men, and promise them life
vpon it, when they had performed the worke,
they would challenge it of debt: no, saith
the LORD, it is an inheritance, I doe not vse
to deale with my children, as men doe with
their seruants, that I should giue them worke
to doe, and when they haue done it, I should
giue them wages, then they would come and
challenge it a my hands by way of debt: no,
saith the Lord, this is an inheritance, and you
are my sonnes, and you shall haue it giuen you
freely, and giuen you as it becomes a Father
to giue it, so you shall take it; therefore, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2062:189"/>
it might bee of free grace, and not of debt,
therefore it is by faith, and not by workes.
And that is added, likewise, if it had beene
by workes, men would haue beene ready to
boast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and haue said, I haue done this, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to keepe the Law, therefore the promise of
eternall life shall bee made good to mee, I shall
receiue it as wages, men would boast in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
No, saith the LORD, no creature shall
boast in it selfe: for that puts euery man further
from the LORD, the more a man reioyceth in
himselfe, the more he stands vpon his owne
bottome, the more he is diuorsed from GOD,
and separated from him: but, saith he, <hi>he that
reioyceth, let him reioyce in the LORD:</hi> for
that fits a man for the LORD, and therefore I
will haue it by faith, it shall not bee by workes.
So, beloued, you see now what is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Surely, looke how <hi>Abraham</hi> was made
partaker of the Couenant, so euery one of vs
must bee; <hi>Abraham</hi> was made partaker of it
by saith, so shall euery man be made partaker
of it by faith, and no otherwise. <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
<hi>God,</hi> when hee had a promise, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he beleeued him, (not that particular act
of faith but) that grace of faith, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
this, and the other promises of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
was counted to him for righteousnesse:</hi> and
so for this cause, because wee beleeue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and the <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace, therefore
the LORD accepts vs, and accounts vs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and because this seemes strange to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2062:189"/>
sonnes of men, therefore we see with how much
adoe <hi>Paul</hi> labours to make it good, what strong
obiections were against it in all times. I haue
shewed the reason. Now when you reade <hi>Rom.</hi>
3. &amp; 4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. you may know the
better the meaning of those places. Well, so
you see the <hi>Couenant;</hi> secondly, you see the
Condition; now you heare that there is such
a <hi>Couenant</hi> as this.</p>
               <p>The third thing is the confirmation of the
<hi>Couenant;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Couenant.</note> when a man heares that GOD will
vouchsafe so much fauour vnto mankinde, a
man is ready to say as <hi>Gedion</hi> did, alas my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is poore in <hi>Manasses,</hi> I am the least in all my
Fathers house, And who am I, that I should
be raised vp hitherto? that such a promise as
this should be made to mee, that I should goe,
and saue <hi>Israel?</hi> &amp;c. I say, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a man might bee ready to obiect, Alas,
what are wee the sonnes of men, that the great
GOD of Heauen and Earth should enter into
such a Couenant with vs, that he should make
vs such promises as these, that he should make
vs heyres of the World, that hee should blesse
vs in that manner, to make vs sonnes, to make
vs Kings and Priests? Saith the LORD, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it is a <hi>Couenant</hi> that needes confirmation:
therefore the LORD hath confirmed it all these
wayes; the LORD hath confirmed it, first, by
his promise; saith he, you haue my sure word
for it; if that bee not enough, I will confirme
it by an Oath, and because he had no greater to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2062:190"/>
sweare by, he saith, by my selfe haue I sworne,
that I will make it good: this is not enough,
but he confirmes it by the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
the Mediator shall come, and confirme
this Testament, and when the Testament is
confirmed by the death of the Testator, there
is no more altering of that;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 15.</note> saith hee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
<hi>A mans Testament no man changeth, after once
it is confirmed:</hi> and when the Testator is dead,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. then the Testament is confirmed: so it
is confirmed by the blood, by the death of the
Testator. This is not enough, but hee hath
added seales vnto it, hee hath confirmed it
likewise by them; saith hee, <hi>I will adde the
seale of Circumcision,</hi> and of the Passeouer.
For Circumcision, saith the LORD, Goe, and
circumcise your selues, and when I see the
Circumcision, I will remember my <hi>Couenant,</hi>
and make it good to you; that, as hee said of
the Bow, he set the Bow in the Cloud, saith
hee, I will make my Couenant, that I will
neuer destroy the Earth againe with raine,
this Bow shall be the witnesse of the Couenant,
and when I looke vpon it, I will remember my
Couenant; after this manner are the signes and
seales of the Couenant; saith he, Circumcise
your selues, and when I see that, I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
my Couenant, and will spare you, and I
will make good to you all the promises of it:
So likewise the Passeouer, saith hee, See that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou keepe it, take the Lambe, and sprinkle the
blood, &amp;c. Saith he, when I see it, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2062:190"/>
my Couenant. Where, beloued, this
is to be obserued, that these signes or seales of
the Couenant, not onely confirme the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
on our part, but they signifie that faith, that
condition which is required on our part: for
when the LORD comes, and lookes into his
Church, and sees a great company in it, sees
his House full, and he comes, and askes, What
doe you in my House? What doe a number of
those that professe themselues to be within the

where is your Circumcision? It may
be you haue that outward Circumcision in the

deny himselfe, and cleaue to <hi>God,</hi> and serue
him with a perfect heart. So againe, after that
manner doth the second signe of the Couenant,
which is the Passeouer, when the LORD shall
aske, Doe you beleeue? Yes, heere is the
sprinkling of the blood of the Lambe. But
where is the true sprinkling vpon the heart and
conscience? heere is the outward Passeouer,
the outward profession, you come and take
the signe and the seale, but where is the inward
sprinkling? Therefore you see what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Passeouer; saith hee, when you
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2062:191"/>
eate the Lambe, &amp;c. haue you tasted of the
sweet of the Lambe, haue you euer tasted of the
sweetnesse that is in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so that you can
loue him, and delight in him? are you clad
like those that went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with their
staues in their hands, and their feet shod; that
is, are you ready to goe out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that is,
from sinne and wickednesse; from the state
of vnregeneracie, wherein you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Againe, hath your soule tasted of the
sowre hearbs, of that bondage, that now you
are weary of all the bondage of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
that you desire exceedingly to goe from it,
that you reckon the contrary <hi>condition</hi> a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of freedome, wherein you are willing and
desirous to continue? saith the LORD, when
I looke vpon these signes, I will remember my
<hi>Couenant;</hi> onely see that your Circumision be
not in the letter, as we see, <hi>Rom. 2.</hi> but see that
you be circumcised in your hearts; that there
be not only a Passeouer, but see that you keepe
the Passeouer with sincerity, see that all leauen
bee cleansed out of your hearts, that is, that
your hearts be empty of the dominion of euery
sinne; see that you haue tasted of the sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that bondage, that you bee willing to
be rid of it, see that you bee willing to trauell
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to another, to a further Country;
see that this be reall, not in profession and shew,
but in deede; and, saith the LORD, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
my <hi>Couenant;</hi> and these are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations
of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> saith the <hi>Lord,</hi> you

shall not neede to doubt it, I haue sworne, it is
repeated, <hi>Heb. 6.</hi> besides, it is confirmed with
blood, with the death of the Testator, and
there is none that alters the Will of the dead,
when he is dead, they adde nothing to it, nor
taks nothing from it: besides, I haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it with seales, and therefore it stands

teaching, when the LORD teacheth vs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
then that is that wee can haue from the

you come not to heare him speake, to

teach all Nations, and I will bee with you,</hi> and I
will make you <hi>able Ministers, not of the letter,
but of the Spirit;</hi> there is no man in the world
can say this, but this great Prophet; and this is
the Prophet that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath raised vp, the
Prophet that he promised hee would <hi>raise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like Moses,</hi> that great Prophet that should
teach men after another fashion, then all the
Prophets before were euer able to doe. And
that is the second part of the <hi>Couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:2062:194"/>Beloued, we may know many things, but it
is a hard thing to know as we ought to know.
It is said of an vnregenerate man, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. Hee
knowes nothing as hee ought to know.</hi> For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
thou mayst know sinne, and know it most
exactly, but if this doe not worke vpon thy
heart, if the sinne lye not exceeding heauy vpon
thee, if it breed not in thee godly sorrow, for it,
if it doth not amaze thee, as it were, with the
filthinesse and vilenesse of it, it is, because thou
dost not yet know it, as thou oughtest to know
it: And how shall a man doe then? Goe to
CHRIST, hee is the Prophet, that is, hee teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man to see things so, that his heart, his
will and affections shall likewise be moued with
it: You are to consider the <hi>Couenant</hi> when you
goe to the LORD; and therefore that man
that saith, I can looke vpon my sinne with dry
eyes, I can looke vpon it, and neuer be affected
with it, this is because he is taught but with the
teaching of men; hee must remember that this
is a part of the Couenant, and <hi>God</hi> hath bound
himselfe by an Oath to performe it. <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> as he is a Prophet, <hi>God</hi> hath sent him to
teach thee all things belonging to saluation,
and so to teach thee, that thou shalt be in a right
manner affected with it. And so likewise put
the case thou know <hi>God,</hi> thou seest him in his
attributes, thou hearest him often described,
and art able to describe him to others, but for
all this, thou findest not thy heart affectioned
towards him, thou seest not that excellency
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2062:194"/>
and beauty that is in him, so that thy heart is
not enamoured with him, thou canst not say
thou <hi>louest him with all thy heart, with all thy
soule, and with all thy strength,</hi> What wilt thou
doe in this case? Goe to <hi>Christ</hi> the Prophet,
and beseech him that hee would teach thee to
know the LORD, this is his promise; if thou
pray to him, and he doe not doe it, vrge him
with this, it is a part of his <hi>Couenant,</hi> that hee
hath confirmed by Oath, and must doe it, and,
beloued, be assured of this, if wee seeke, and be
earnest with him, he will teach vs to know the
<hi>Lord,</hi> and to know him so, that wee shall loue
him with all our soule, and with all our strength.
The like may I say of any thing else; put the
case afflictions come vpon thee, and thou bee
not able to bee patient vnder such afflictions,
suppose that it be a matter of disgrace and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit,
that so wounds thee, that thy heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be at rest, what is the reason of this? thou
callest to minde, it may bee, all the rules of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
that should teach thee to beare afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
well, and yet thou art not able to doe it:
the cause is, because thou dost not yet know
these outward temptations, these outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
as thou oughtest to know them, if thou
diddest, they would seeme small to thine eyes,
sinne would be an exceeding great griefe, but
these would be but trifles and flea-bitings, in
comparison of the other: goe to <hi>Christ</hi> now,
and beseech him to shew thee what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these outward crosses and losses, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2062:195"/>
thou mayst be taught of him once: hee is the
great Prophet, that teacheth a man so, hee so
presents things in their owne colours to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that the will and affections fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and apprehend them aright; goe to him,
and beseech him that thou mayst know them as
thou oughtest, and thou shalt finde, that thou
shalt be able to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the greatest crosse with
patience, it shall bee nothing then to thee, it
will appeare to be a small matter, when he hath
taught thee to iudge aright, thou shalt not be
deceiued in it.</p>
               <p>So likewise, for pleasure, when a man finds
his heart so wedded to any sinfull lust, to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
haunt, wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in his heart is held inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it cannot diuorse it selfe from it, goe to
<hi>Christ,</hi> hee is the great Prophet. Thus we may
doe, beloued, with the rest. This is the second
part of the <hi>Couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third part of the <hi>Couenant</hi> is, that which
he will performe to vs, as he is King, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in these 3. things.</p>
               <p>You know the Office of a King is to guide
and rule; now, if thou finde thy heart vnruly,
if thou finde thy selfe subiect to vnruly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to sinfull inordinate lusts, which thou canst
not master, it is a part of his Kingdome, now to
set vp his owne gouernment in thy heart, <hi>to put
his Law into thy minde,</hi> and to write it in thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, that so thou mayst bee indeed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> in a willing
manner. When a man sees nothing (as wee
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2062:195"/>
said before) but the outward letter of the Law,
he will neuer be subiect, he will neuer yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
but Christ comes as a King now, and
puts an inward disposition into the minde, that
shall answer the letter without, and so he makes
a man subiect to his gouernment. Beloued, that
Phrase is to be marked, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Saith the
<hi>Lord, I will put my Law into their mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> there
are Lawes out of mens minds, Lawes without,
that euery man may see; but it is another thing
to haue the Law put into a mans minde: for
example, this is the Law without, <hi>Thou shalt
loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all
thy soule, and with all thy strength.</hi> To answer
which, you shall see, <hi>Deut. 30. 6. I will circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
thy heart, and then thou shalt be able to loue
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soule, and with all thy strength.</hi> That is, I
will put this affection, or this grace of loue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thy heart, it shal not be without onely, but I
will put it within, that there shall bee a grace
within, a habit of loue within, answerable to
the Commandement without; this is to put
the Law into the minde: and so likewise, <hi>Ier.
32. 40.</hi> you know, this is the Commandement
of the LORD, You shall feare the LORD, <hi>and
keepe his Ordinances, and his Statutes, and his
Commandements to doe them.</hi> Well, saith the
<hi>Lord</hi> there, <hi>I will make a Couenant with you:</hi> and
what will I doe? <hi>I will put my feare into your
hearts.</hi> I will not onely giue you this precept,
that thou shalt looke on without, Thou shalt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2062:196"/>
feare mee, and keepe my Commandements,
but I will put the affections of feare into thy
heart, there it shall bee, and then thou shalt easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feare mee, and keepe my Commandements;
thou shalt feare to disobey me, thou shalt feare
and tremble at my Word, and take heed how
thou doe any thing contrary to my mind: and
beloued, when this is done, hee makes indeed
Kings, as hee makes vs Priests and Prophets:
for when a man is thus taught, he is a Prophet,
other men need not to teach him, for hee is a
spirituall man then, and is able to iudge of all
things; I say, when this gouernment is set vp,
and the Law is put into his minde, when it is
put into his inward parts; I say, when this is
done, then he makes vs Kings: for when men
haue so much strength within themselues, that
they can guide and rule themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and walke
in the way of righteousnesse, now they are
made Kings, and such Kings the <hi>Lord</hi> makes all
those that come to him. This is the first part of
this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The second part is, to giue vs abundance of
all things, to giue vs peace: for the Office of
a King, you know, is to keepe his people in
peace, as it is said of <hi>Saul, hee cloathed them
with scarlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is, he made his people to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with wealth, and peace, and quietnesse:
this the <hi>Lord</hi> doth likewise, and this is a part of
his spirituall Kingdome. Now his Kingdome
is spirituall; therefore the maine worke of it is
to giue vs inward peace and ioy; you may
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2062:196"/>
haue troubles in the world, but my Kingdome
is not of this world, and therefore wee are not
so much to expect an outward worldly peace,
though we haue likewise a promise of that, but
in mee you shall haue inward peace, saith hee,
the Kingdome of <hi>God</hi> is in righteousnesse, that
is the first part, when <hi>God</hi> workes righteousnes,
as I haue named before, the second is peace,
and ioy, so that that is a part of the <hi>Couenant,
GOD,</hi> promised inward peace and ioy; beloued,
when you want it, know it is a part of the <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
you may goe to GOD, and beseech him
to fill your hearts with this <hi>peace that passeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderstanding,</hi>
and with this <hi>ioy which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
and glorious;</hi> goe, and beseech him
to enrich your hearts with those spiritual riches
that belong to saluation, this is a part of his
Kingdome, and that which hee hath promised
to vs: now this is not all, but likewise an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace he promiseth, hee hath promised
we shall be heyres of all things, all things are
yours, he hath promised outward riches, we
are heyres of all the world; so that it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a part of his <hi>Couenant,</hi> when a man wants
any outward comfort, any outward helpe, any
blessings, or deliuerance, he may goe to <hi>Christ,</hi>
that is the King of all Kings, as hee is Lord of
all things, as he himselfe is heyre of all things,
and beseech him to grant it vnto him: for it is
a part of his <hi>Couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the third and last is, that we shall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our enemies, that is the third branch of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2062:197"/>
this Kingdome; And that which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Abraham, thou shalt possesse the gates of
thine Enemes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when hee renewed his <hi>Couenant,</hi>
vpon the offering of his sonne, and you shall
finde it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74. repeated againe, this is the
great promise that <hi>God</hi> hath made, <hi>that being
deliuered from the hands of all our enemies, wee
might serue him in righteousnesse and holinesse all
the dayes of our life.</hi> Now as his Kingdome is
spirituall, so the chiefe part of this Kingdome
stands in ouercoming our spirituall enemies;
and therefore you may challenge this <hi>Couenant</hi>
at his hands, when you are to wrastle with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
or any temptation and lust, LORD, hast
thou not said that thou wilt deliuer me out of
the hands of all mine enemies? Is it not a part
of thy Couenant? But, beloued, that is not
all neither, there is a promise, and that is a part
of the Couenant likewise, that wee shall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our outward enemies, thou shalt possesse
the gate of thine enemies, so farre as it is good
for vs, as farre as <hi>God</hi> sees it meet, he dispenseth
these in a different manner, but yet it is a part of
the Couenant, and therefore a man may goe
and challenge this at <hi>Gods</hi> hands; LORD, if it
be good, if it be fit, and meet for me to haue it,
thou hast promised it, I shall haue victory ouer
them also. So now you see what the <hi>Couenant</hi>
is: But now there is one maine generall, that
likewise is a branch of this <hi>Couenant,</hi> that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
to all the three, that is the giuing of the
Spirit, it is a branch of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> as wee see,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2062:197"/>
                  <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. which is repeated, <hi>Act. 2. I will powre
out my Spirit vpon all flesh in those dayes, and your
yong men shall see visions, &amp;c.</hi> Beloued, know
that this was a part of the Couenant that was
made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> It was expressed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
in generall, <hi>I will blesse thee,</hi> afterwards
there were seuerall branches of it; now one
thing was expressed, as part of the Couenant,
and then another; among the branches, this
was one, <hi>I will powre out my Spirit vpon all flesh,</hi>
which is that which you haue likewise, <hi>Esay 44.
3. I will powre out my Spirit as water vpon the
dry ground, and you shall grow as the grasse, and

that this is the meaning, <hi>Peter</hi> makes it good,
<hi>Acts 2.</hi> and so likewise our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> the
great promise that he made to them was, <hi>I will
bapize you with the Holy Ghost,</hi> this promise was
made before hee departed in the flesh, but it
was fulfilled after, when hee powred forth his
Spirit. Beloued, this is that great part of the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> that which comprehends the life of
all the other three, that which inabled vs to doe
all the rest, that which makes vs Kings, and
Priests, and Prophets, this powring out of the

Beloued, that which makes vs able to be

made against this Couenant. There were two
great obiections that <hi>Paul</hi> euery where met
with, (for our scope is, that when wee put all
this together, that we haue deliuered about this
Couenant, you may reade at leasure <hi>Rom. 3. 4.</hi>
and <hi>Gal. 3. 4.</hi> and all the promises made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) I say, there
are two great obiections that <hi>Paul</hi> euery where
met with.</p>
               <p>The one is from the Law,<note place="margin">1. Obiect.</note> Is it not said euery
where, Those that obey the Commandement
shall liue, and euery promise is made still to
them that feare the LORD, and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?
and therefore it is by the
Law.</p>
               <p>Nay,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 3.</hi> it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that it should be by the Law: for the Law
was giuen 430. yeeres after the promise, and
Couenant was established with <hi>Abraham</hi> long
before it; it cannot bee now, that that which
comes after can dissannull that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but besides there is another great reason,
and that is this, saith the Apostle, you were
neuer able to keepe the Law, you could neuer
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2062:198"/>
be saued, if you would haue it by the Law, to
what end is the Law giuen then? <hi>By reason of
transgression,</hi> that you might learne to know
how impossible it is for you to come to <hi>God,</hi> to
be partaker of the Couenant any other way,
then by faith; saith he, you might remember
that <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was in innocency and
perfection, was much stronger then you, yet
did not keepe the Law; but, because that was
easie for people to forget, the Law was giuen
againe by <hi>Moses,</hi> vpon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that the
LORD by that meanes might reminde you of
the Commandement, and of your sinnes, and
of the curse belonging to you; and therefore,
saith hee, when the Law was deliuered, it was
so terrible, that <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe did tremble;
and therefore, said the People, <hi>Lord, doe not
thou speake to vs any more,</hi> deliuer not the Law
to vs any more, but let <hi>Moses</hi> come, and bee
as a <hi>Mediator</hi> betweene vs, let him speake; for
we are not able to see these fires, these burnings,
wee are not able to see this and liue. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it is this, the Law, if any man looke on
it, it is so terrible, when GOD comes to speake
to a man in his Law, and in his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that there is nothing to be expected but
death: that same fearefulnesse at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
was but onely an expression of that feare which
the Law of <hi>God</hi> puts vpon euery mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and therefore, when the people then
desired a Mediator, that might speake, and that
<hi>GOD</hi> might speake no more, another thing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2062:199"/>
was signified by it, that no man is able to come
to <hi>God</hi> by yeelding obedience to the Law, but
he must needs haue a Mediator to goe between
GOD and him.</p>
               <p>The other obiection is from the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Law;<note place="margin">2. Obiect.</note> they were ready to say, We
haue a Priest, we haue Sacrifices, we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
washings and Rites, &amp;c, wee were wont
to bee saued by them, why may we not so
still?</p>
               <p>The answer to it is,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> That these were but the
oldnesse of the letter; for indeed all these did
but cloathe the <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace; the <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of Grace was deliuered to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the
Ceremonies did indeede but set it out, they
were but types and shaddowes, by which it
was expressed to the Iewes: the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their ignorance, were not able to see the
body for the clothes, they were not able to see
the signification of the Spirit for the letter, they
were not able to see the sword for the sheath,
the kernell for the shell; that is, they could not
see <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, the inward promises, but
stucke in the outward barke, and rinde of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
in the shell of them, and so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
vnprofitable; but indeed those Rites did
nothing, but cloathe the <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace,
and set it forth to them. So much shall serue
for the dispatching of those fiue things.</p>
               <p>Now hence you see how those difficulties
may bee answered, that I mentioned before.
For example, it is said, <hi>the promise is made to the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2062:199"/>
seede,</hi> yet the promise is made to vs,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the <hi>Couenant</hi> is made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
How can all these stand together?<note place="margin">Ans.</note> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
that are made to the seede, that is to <hi>Christ</hi>
himselfe, those are these promises: <hi>Thou shalt
bee a Priest for euer,</hi> and <hi>I will giue thee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Dauid, thou shalt sit in that Throne,</hi>
thou shalt be <hi>a Prince of peace,</hi> and <hi>the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be vpon thy shoulder;</hi> likewise thou shalt
bee a Prophet to my people, thou shalt <hi>open the
prison to the Capti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> thou shalt be anoynted, &amp;c.
and then shalt goe and preach to them: These
are the promises that are made vnto the
seede.</p>
               <p>The promises that are made to vs, though
they bee of the same <hi>Couenant,</hi> yet they differ
in this, the actiue part is committed to the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
to the seede it selfe; but the passiue part,
those are the promises that belong to vs, <hi>You
shall bee taught,</hi> you shall bee made Prophets,
likewise, you shall haue your sinnes forgiuen,
you shall haue the effect of his Priesthood made
good vnto you, you shall be subiect to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
by an inherent righteousnes that he
shall worke in you; for you shall bee made
Kings; So the promise is made to vs. How is
the promise made to <hi>Abraham?</hi> for it is said,
<hi>In thee all the Nations of the Earth shall bee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning of this is, they are deriuatiue
promises, the primitiue and Originall was
made to <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> but why is it said then,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2062:200"/>
that in <hi>Abraham all the Nations of the Earth
shall be blessed?</hi> the meaning of it is this, there
was none that was euer partaker of these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were deriued from <hi>Abraham</hi> to all
the men in the world besides, that euer haue
beene since. Now what is it to be a childe of
<hi>Abraham?</hi> not to be borne of <hi>Abraham</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the flesh, but to be like <hi>Abraham; you
are the children of the Deuill,</hi> Why? You are
like him. So that all that haue faith, are the
children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but more is meant then
that; I say, all that doe partake of this promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Messiah,</hi> are deriued from <hi>Abraham,</hi> either
deriued from him, or grafted into him, one of
these two; all that were saued before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of <hi>Christ,</hi> were either such as descended
from him, or were ingrafted into the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But what doe you say of the Gentiles,
that are now come in? How doe they receiue
from <hi>Abraham?</hi> How can it be said, in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
shall all the Nations of the world bee blessed?</hi>
Beloued,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17.</note> you know it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that the
<hi>naturall branches were broken off, and the wilde
Oliue is ingrafted in:</hi> that is the reason likewise
why the Law comes from <hi>Sion,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> will
haue the Gentiles to bee ingrafted into the
stocke, as it were, he will haue the Law to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he will haue them put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Famely as the proselytes, and so were
all Nations: for they receiued it from <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
for they had the Oracles of <hi>God</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2062:200"/>
to them, all the Nations in the world recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them from them, they drew that sap of
knowledge from them, so that they were graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in: thus all the Nations in the world were
blessed in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> was blessed
in the seede it selfe. But yet one obiection is
behinde, that is, how comes this to passe,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that
to be renewed in the spirit of our minds, and to
walke in the wayes of the LORD, in the way of
regeneration, should be a part of the Couenant

be renewed, and then you shall be forgiuen, &amp;c.
you shall haue the Kingdome, and yet, for all

               <p>Beloued, to this I answer briefly,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

bringing forth the fruite of these inward abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of these inward habits and graces, that are
planted in vs by the power of <hi>Christ,</hi> that thing
is required in vs. As, for example, the very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of faith, the very grace and power of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
that <hi>God</hi> hath promised to giue, it belongs
to him, but to beleeue, to take the promises, to
accept of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and to receiue him, and
the gift of righteousnesse by him, this is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as a condition on our part. And so much
shall serue for the opening of this, and for this
point.</p>
               <p>The next question wee had to propound to
you,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> was this, How a man should know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be within the Couenant, or no?<note place="margin">Ans.</note> You
shall know it by this, How did <hi>Abraham</hi> know
whether he was in the Couenant, or how will
you know whether <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other
were? saith the Text, <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued
<hi>God,</hi> and therefore <hi>God</hi> reckoned him as a man
that was righteous, and accepted him to bee a
partaker of the <hi>Couenant:</hi> and so, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
it is certaine then, thou art within the
<hi>Couenant;</hi> but how shall a man know that?
<hi>Gal. 5. 5. Neither Circumcision auaileth any thing,
nor vncircumcision, but faith which worketh by
loue.</hi> If thou canst finde this now, that thou art
able to take <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to take him as a LORD
and <hi>Sauio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r,</hi> thou art able to beleeue all the
<hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace, thou art by that put into
the <hi>Couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:2062:201"/>But how shall a man know whether this faith
be right or no? for, you know, there is a false,
dead, and counterfeit faith: if it be right, thou
shalt finde it to be of a working and liuely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but many times we may bee deceiued in
that. A woman many times thinkes she is with
childe, but if she finde no motion nor stirring,
it is an argument she was deceiued: So, when
a man thinkes that hee hath faith in his heart,
but yet he finds no life, no motion, no stirring,
there is no worke proceeding from his faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is an argument he was mistaken, hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in it: for, if it be a right faith, it will
worke, there will be life and motion in it. As
<hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, you see, it enabled him to doe
whatsoeuer GOD appointed him, to offer his
sonne, to excommunicate <hi>Ismael,</hi> when GOD
bid him cast him out, though hee loued <hi>Ismael</hi>
exceeding dearely, yet he did it, and did it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily;
so, whatsoeuer <hi>God</hi> bade him doe; here
was a working faith.</p>
               <p>But yet a little further, a man may be yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in this, a mans faith may worke, and
an Hypocrite may doe many workes, if it bee
but bare working, a man may bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and therefore this is added further, it
<hi>workes by loue.</hi> Beloued, a man may doe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
many duties, as you know, hee may suffer
Martyrdome, he may giue all to the poore, hee
may be a very diligent Preacher of the Gospell:
for <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I may <hi>speake with the tongue of
men and Angels,</hi> I may <hi>giue my goods to the poore,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:2062:202"/>
I may <hi>giue my body to be burned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and yet if these
great workes be done, <hi>without loue, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
But, on the other side, if you finde this,
that you doe but the least worke, if it be but to
giue a cup of cold water, and doe it out of loue,
if you abstaine from one sinne, if you ouercome
any one lust whatsoeuer, that is deare and neare
to you, because you loue <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> if you set
your selues vpon any worke, vpon any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and endeauour, and thy heart witnesseth
this to thee, it is because I loue the LORD, and
desire exceedingly to please him, he is one that
I would faine haue communion with, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is in him, therefore I doe these workes:
for it is my meate and drinke to doe his will;
now thou art on a sure ground, now thou maist
know thou art within the <hi>Couenant:</hi> for thou
beleeuest as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and therefore thou
art within the <hi>Couenant,</hi> as hee was; thou maist
know it, because thy faith workes, and then
thou maist know that it workes right, because it
is done by loue. Well, yet there is another
way to know this, that is <hi>in thy seede</hi> (saith the
Text) <hi>shall all the Nations of the world bee blessed,</hi>
if a man be then ingrafted into this seede, into
the <hi>Messiah</hi> once, then he shall bee blessed, if
once he belong to him. Well, how shall a man
know that.</p>
               <p>If thou haue receiued the Spirit of the Son:
for whosoeuer is in <hi>Christ,</hi> hath receiued the
Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> if he haue not receiued the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Christ,</hi> he is not in him. Consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2062:202"/>
you haue receiued the Spirit of the Sonne,
the Spirit of the promised seede, that is, thou
art made like <hi>Christ</hi> by the Spirit: for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
will assimulate thee, and renew this Image
in thee, he makes thee such another in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as he is; yea, he will not onely doe this,
but he will witnesse to thee, that he is thy <hi>God,</hi>
and that thou art of those that are partakers of
the <hi>Couenant,</hi> and therefore that is the way to
finde it out, that is the thing I intend to insist
vpon, to finde out whether you haue this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
you shall finde it, this is the great marke that
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> insists vpon, still in all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
by which a man may know whether he
be within the <hi>Couenant,</hi> or no, still it is this,
we haue <hi>receiued the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit seales
vs to the day of redemption, we are established and
sealed by the Spirit of promise,</hi> and wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<hi>the Spirit, which is an earnest, &amp;c.</hi> Now
to know whether you haue the Spirit, I will
commend these two places of Scripture to you
to consider: one is, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. You haue not
receiued the spirit of bondage, to feare againe, but
the spirit of Adoption, whereby you cry Abba
Father; the same spirit beares witnesse with our
spirits, that wee are the sonnes of GOD.</hi> The
other you shall finde, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 8. And <hi>there
are three that beare record in Earth, the Spirit,
the Water, and the Blood, and these three agree
in one.</hi> If you would finde out whether you
haue the spirit of the Sonne, or no, you shall
know it by these three:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2062:203"/>
In the Antecedents, the Concomitants, and
the Consequents.</p>
               <p>The Antecedent is the <hi>Spirit of bondage;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
that of necessity must goe before, so that
if thou neuer hadst the spirit of bondage, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
thou hast not yet receiued the spirit of
the Sonne: for the Apostle speakes of it heere,
as the common condition to all Christians, they
doe not receiue the spirit of bondage againe;
you had it once, but now you haue the spirit of
Adoption: I say, euery man must haue this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of bondage, and the ground of it is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man can come to <hi>Christ,</hi> except the
Law be a Schoolemaster to bring him to <hi>Christ;</hi>
now the Law is not a Schoolemaster, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no man, except the spirit of bondage worke
feare, except the spirit of bondage put an edge
vpon the Law, put a Sword into the hand of
the Law, to pricke the heart, to wound the
heart,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> as it is said, <hi>Acts 2.</hi> this is the <hi>spirit of
bondage,</hi> Beloued, you may heare the Law,
and the threatnings and curses, applyed to you
10000. times ouer, and yet no feare be bred in
you, except the spirit of bondage ioyne with it,
that makes it effectuall. Now in the Law are
included iudgements and afflictions, which are
but the execution of the Law, sometimes it goes
with the Law it selfe, somtimes with the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and afflictions, it is the spirits of bondage

his heart was wounded, this was not for
these particular Iudgements, there might bee a
great raine, there might be a great Earthquake,
and thunder in Wheat-haruest, and yet mens
hearts little moued, but there went a spirit of
bondage, that bred a feare in them, this is that,
I say, no man can come to <hi>Christ</hi> without the
Law, either in it selfe, or in afflictions, which
are but the executioners of it, and these are not
effectuall without the spirit of bondage: and
there is a very great reason for it; because, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
wee should neuer know the loue of
<hi>Christ,</hi> he that hath not knowne what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this spirit of bondage is, what these
feares are, what these terrours of conscience are
in some measure, knowes not what <hi>Christ</hi> hath
suffered for him, or what deliuerance hee hath
had by him; besides, he will not be applyable to
<hi>Christ:</hi> But I will not stand more vpon this.

impression vpon it; I confesse it is different, it
is sometimes more, sometimes lesse, but all
haue it, more or lesse; sometimes the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
goes so close with the reuealing of sinne,
and of Iudgement, that it is not so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
sometimes againe, <hi>God</hi> meanes to bestow
vpon some men a great measure of grace, and
therfore he giues them a greater measure of the
spirit of bondage, because <hi>God</hi> meanes to teach
them more to prize <hi>Christ,</hi> he meanes more to
baptize them with the baptisme of the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> and therefore hee baptizeth them with a
greater measure of the spirit of bondage, they
shall drinke deeper of that spirit, because his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is, that they shall drinke deeper of the
spirit of Adoption: and therefore <hi>Christ</hi> takes
it for an argument concerning the Woman,
when he saw she loued exceeding much, surely
she had a great measure of the spirit of bondage,
she was much wounded for her sinnes, there
had beene exceeding much forgiuen her, in her
apprehension; and so was <hi>Paul</hi> exceedingly
wounded, you know. This must goe before.</p>
               <p>The things which goe together with it, are
these three, the testimony of the <hi>blood,</hi> of the
<hi>water,</hi> and of our <hi>owne spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, beloued, there is the testimony of the
blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>there are three that beare record in the
Earth, the spirit, the water, and the blood,</hi> though
the spirit be set first, as it is vsuall amongst the
<hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and in the Scriptures, to put the last
first, if a man would know now, whether hee
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2062:204"/>
be in <hi>Christ,</hi> whether he hath receiued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
seede, or no, let him consider first, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee hath beleeued in the blood, that is,
there is a word of promise, that saith thus to
vs, there is a Sacrifice that is offered, there is
the blood of the Lambeshed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world, and this blood shall wash
thee from all thy sinnes, when a man stands to
consider this promise, beloued, this promise
bath two things in it, there is the truth of it,
and the goodnesse of it; a man doth, with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> beleeue the truth of it, he beleeues
<hi>God,</hi> and saith, it is true, I beleeue it, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
there is a goodnesse in it, and therefore, as
the vnderstanding saith, it is true, so the will
saith, it is good, and therefore he takes it, and
embraceth it, and is exceeding greedy of it:
for when the spirit of bondage makes a man
feare, it empties a man of all righteousnesse, as
a man empties a Caske, that there is nothing
left in it, when it puls away all other props and
stayes from it, it leaues a man in this case, that
he sees nothing in the world to saue him, but
the blood of <hi>Christ;</hi> when a man sees this, hee
takes fast hold of that, he will not let it goe for
any thing; and though it be told him, you shall
haue many troubles and crosses, you must part
with all you haue, you shall haue somewhat
hereafter, but you shall haue little for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
he cares not though it costs him his life,
so he may ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e this blood to wash away his sins,
it is enough, this he layes fast hold vpon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:2062:205"/>Beloued, when a man doth this, at that very
houre he is entred into <hi>Couenant,</hi> he is <hi>translated
from death to life,</hi> he hath now receiued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
seede, and he shall be blessed, for <hi>God</hi> hath
said it, and sworne it, and it cannot be otherwise;
and this is the testimony of the blood, when a
man can say, I know I haue taken and applyed
the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> I rest vpon it, I beleeue that
my sinnes are forgiuen, I graspe it, I receiue it,
this is the testimony of the blood.</p>
               <p>Now, when a man hath tooke the blood,
What? shall he continue in filthinesse now, and
walke after the lusts, of his former ignorance?
No, the <hi>Lord</hi> comes not by blood onely, but
by water also, that is, by sanctification, that is,
he sends the Spirit of sanctification, that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and washeth his seruants, that washeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
not onely the outward filthinesse, but the
euill nature, the swinish nature, that they desire
no more to wallow in the myre, as before: for
the <hi>Lord</hi> will not haue a sluttish Church, and
therefore,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Eph. 5. he washeth his Church, and
clenseth it;</hi> he washeth euery man in the Church
from top to toe; there is not one place in the
soule, not one place in the conuersation, but
it is rensed in this water; and then, when a
man comes to finde this, that he hath not onely
found the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> applyed to him by
faith, but hath found that he hath been able to
purifie himselfe, and by the worke of <hi>Christs</hi>
Spirit ioyning with him, when he goes about
to purge himselfe, that helpes to cleanse his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2062:205"/>
conscience from dead workes. There is the
second testimony.</p>
               <p>Now follows the testimony of our own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that gathers conclusions from both these,
and saith thus, Since I haue receiued the blood,
and seeing I am able to purifie my selfe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I am in a good estate, I am a partaker of
the <hi>Couenant:</hi> if a man could say this truely, it
is said, <hi>whosoeuer beleeues, shall be saued,</hi> but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
this is the testimony of the blood onely;
but when a man can say, I doe labour to purifie
my selfe, I desire nothing in the world so much,
I doe it in good earnest, this is the testimony of
the water to this signe, and testimony of the
blood, which shewes that it is true, it is a linely
hope: for he <hi>that hath</hi> a liuely <hi>hope, hee purifies
himselfe, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. But some man may say,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 3.</note> This
testimony of a mans owne spirit may deceiue
him. I answer, it cannot, because though it be
called the testimony of our owne spirit, yet it
is a spirit enlightned, it is a spirit sanctified with
the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and then that Rule is true,
1 <hi>Ioh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. If our owne heart condemne not;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.</note> that is,
if the heart of a man enlightned, if the heart
of a man with which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> ioynes,
if the heart of a man sanctified doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
him, if hee haue the testimony of this
Spirit, he shall be saued, he needs not doubt it,
he hath boldnesse towards GOD, then againe
hee must consider this worke, the testimony of
the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and <hi>these
three agree in one;</hi> it is not the testimony of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2062:206"/>
Spirit alone, but it is the testimony of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ioyned with it; if it were but the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of one, indeed the ground were not good,
but they all agree in one; and therefore if thou
haue one sure to thee, it is enough. These are
the things which goe before, and accompany it.</p>
               <p>Now followes the testimony of <hi>Gods</hi> spirit;
which we shall see described, besides the places
I named to you,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Eph. 1. Wherein after you belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, you were sealed with the spirit of promise.</hi> My
beloued, when a man hath beleeued, and tooke
<hi>lesus Christ;</hi> secondly, when hee hath washed
and purified himselfe, that is, hee hath gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this worke, and so his owne spirit gathers
a testimony hence, that he is in a good estate;
after he hath thus beleeued, then, saith he, comes
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and seales the same things vnto
you; that is, the LORD leaues a man alone a
while, as it were, to champ vpon the bridle, as
I may say, he lets a man alone to some doubts
and feares, that so hee may purge himselfe the
more carefully; but after a time, when a man
hath put to his seale that <hi>God</hi> is true, then the
LORD seales him againe with the spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that is, the <hi>LORD</hi> sends the spirit into
his heart, and that spirit giues witnesse to him,
and when he hath put to his seale, that <hi>GOD</hi> is
true, then the LORD puts to his seale, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
him that hee hath receiued him to mercy.
You will say, What is this seale, or witnesse of
the Spirit? My beloued, it is a thing that wee
cannot expresse, it is a certaine diuine impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2062:206"/>
of light, a certaine vnexpressible assurance
that we are the sonnes of <hi>God,</hi> a certaine secret
manifestation, that <hi>God</hi> hath receiued vs, and
put away our sinnes; I say, it is such a thing, that
no man knowes, but they that haue it; you
shall finde it expressed by all these places of
Scripture,<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that shall fill his heart with peace and ioy, such
a thing that no man knowes but himselfe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
this is the testimony of the Spirit. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
it is a wondrous thing, and if there were
not some Christians that did feele it, and know
it, you might beleeue there were no such thing,
that it were but a fancie or enthusiasme; but,
beloued, it is certaine, there are a generation of
men, that know what this seale of the <hi>Lord</hi> is;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2062:207"/>
indeed you must remember this, to distinguish
it from all fancies and delusions, this Spirit
comes after you haue the water and the blood,
after you are beleeuers, after you haue purged
your selues; and therefore if any man haue such
flashes of light and ioy, that witnesse that hee
hath receiued the promise, and that he is in the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> and for all this he haue not the things
that goe before it, now thou maist take it for a

thou art deceiued, if thou art perswaded

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second way to know whether wee be in
the <hi>Couenant,</hi> or no, is, to consider whether we
haue taken the promised seede; for in him shall
all the nations of the world be blessed. How
shall wee know that? If we haue the Spirit of
the Sonne, that is knowne by the Spirit it selfe,
<hi>the Spirit beares witnesse;</hi> the witnesse of the
Spirit, as I told you, it is knowne by that which
goes before it, by that which accompanies it,
and that which followes after. This is the
point, that we were in handling, and wee were
broken off in the middest of it; wee will recall
it a little, and deliuer it somewhat more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly

and the Law is not effectuall without the
spirit of bondage, neither the Law, in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,

of those threatnings: you may heare
the Law opened vnto you a hundred and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

you with afflictions and crosses, yet except
there be a spirit of bondage to worke together

If men would haue looked to the
<hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> without being stung of the fiery
Serpents, <hi>God</hi> would haue spared the spirit of
bondage; but, <hi>beloued,</hi> who doth it? who is

the Woman that had the bloody issue, as long

as she had mony in her purse, or that there were
Physicians to goe to, that shee had ability to
haue them, shee would not come to <hi>Christ,</hi> but
when she had spent all, when she saw there was
no more hope, then shee comes to <hi>Christ,</hi> and
was healed of her bloody issue: so doe we, so
long as we can liue in sinne, wee consider not
the greatnesse, nor the dearenesse of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease;

goe on, we come not to <hi>Christ,</hi> but when wee
are spoiled of all by the spirit of bondage, when
wee are put in feare of death, that is it that
brings vs home to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and therefore
we must make an account of it as a generall rule,
there must be such a spirit of bondage to bring
vs home: we doe in this case as <hi>Ioab</hi> did with

except there be some such crosse as may
make an impression vpon vs, such a crosse
as hath the spirit of bondage ioyned with it,
to cause it to wound our spirits, (as it is said,
<hi>they were pricked in their hearts when they heard
Peter)</hi> I say, wee would not come home vnto
the LORD, wee must haue such an <hi>aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

whether thou hast tasted of this spirit;
and therefore you may obserue this by the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2062:211"/>
way, that when <hi>God</hi> doth write bitter things
against a man, it is not a iust cause of deiection:
for this is a signe that <hi>God</hi> is beginning a good
worke in thee, seeke not to put it off, and to
thinke, it is a miserable thing to bee vnder such
a bondage as this: no, but make this vse of it,
let it bring thee home to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And
heere, by the way, that men may not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in this, and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Alas, I haue not had this
spirit of bondage, and feare, and therefore I
feare I am not right.</p>
               <p>My beloued,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> you must know for what end
the <hi>Lord</hi> sends it: hee sends it for these two
ends, and by that you shall know whether you
haue it or no: for if thou hast the end once, if
the effect be wrought, no doubt but thou hast
had the cause that produceth that effect.</p>
               <p>One end is to bring vs home to <hi>Christ;</hi> if
thou finde thou hast tooke <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> it is
certaine, there hath beene a worke of the spirit
of bondage vpon thy heart, if thou finde thou
art willing to take him vpon any conditions,
thou art willing to deny thy selfe, thou art
willing to serue him, to loue him, and to obey
him.</p>
               <p>And a second end is, GOD sends this Spirit
of bondage, that thou mightest know the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
of sinne, and learne to abstaine from
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou mayest learne to tremble at his
Word, for the time to come, I looke to
him that is of a contrite spirit, and that
trembleth at my Word: that euen so
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2062:212"/>
as parents doe with their children, they would
neuer afflict and correct their children for that
which is past, but their end is for the time to
come, that they may not commit the same fault
againe; otherwise the parent would not lay
any affliction vpon the childe; and, beloued,
know that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath this very end in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the spirit of bondage, thou must not
thinke it is for thy sinnes past, that there may
be a kinde of satisfaction made for them, that
is not the end, but the end is, that thou mightst
know the bitternesse of sinne for the time to
come, that thou being scorched once with it,
thou mightst not easily meddle with it againe;
and therefore if thou findest this to be thy case,
thou hast so farre tasted of the terrours of the
Almighty, that thou darest not aduenture vpon
sinne, thou standest in awe of the LORD, that
thou darest not bee so bold with sinne as thou
hast beene, that thou darest not meddle with
the occasions of it, that thou darest not come
neere it; I say, if thou finde such a tendernesse
of conscience in thy selfe, if thou finde that that
sinne is made terrible to thee, that thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
despise before, (for it is the property of a
carnall man to despise his waies) I say, if this be
wrought in thee, defer not, make not dainty of
applying the promises, because thou hast not
receiued the spirit of bondage: for thou hast,
thou hast the effect, therefore thou needest not
doubt, but that thou hast the thing. This is it
that goes before: that which goes together
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2062:212"/>
with it, I shewed you; then is the witnesse of
the blood, and of the water, and of our owne
spirit; there bee three that beare witnesse in
Earth, 1 <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

blood;</hi> by spirit there, is meant our owne spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
enlightned; by blood is meant Iustification;
by water is meant sanctification; so that that
goes together with the witnesse of the spirit.</p>
               <p>The first is the witnesse of the blood; that is,
when a man is humbled, when a man is broken
with the spirit of bondage, then hee beginnes
to make out for a pardon: when he sees hee is
arrested, as it were, when he is shut vp, as that
phrase is vsed,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and sees what a debt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him, and he is not able to pay the least
farthing, now he beginnes to looke out for a
surety, now he beginnes to hunger and thirst
exceedingly after <hi>Christ,</hi> now he is not content
onely to watch with him, to serue him, and to
obey him, but hee is willing to part with his
life, and all that he hath, vpon that condition.
Now when a man is in this case, then the <hi>Lord</hi>
beginnes to shew him the blood of his Sonne,
he begins to open a little crevis of light, and to
shew him the New Testament in his blood that
is, the New Testament confirmed in his <hi>blood,
shed for many, for the remission of sinnes.</hi> I say, he
begins then to looke vpon the promises, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
such promises as these, <hi>Come to mee, all yee
that are weary, &amp;c.</hi> and, <hi>If any man sinne, we haue
an Aduocate;</hi> and, Let whosoeuer will, come,

                  </gap>ne, they shall be saued. I say, these are all
promises made in the blood of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
now he begins to consider these promises, and
he begins first to thinke, What? are these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
true? Yes, surely they are most true,
they are confirmed wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the blood, with the death of the
Testator: a mans <hi>Couenant,</hi> after it is once
made, and the Testator is dead, <hi>Gal. 3.</hi> no man
addes to it, or takes from it. Now when a man
considers this, Are these the promises of the
LORD? hath hee confirmed them with an
Oath? are they confirmed with the blood of
the Testator? Certainely, they are most true,
I cannot doubt of them: but then he begins to
consider, As they are true, how fit are they for
mee? what is the goodnes of them? They are
also exceeding good, there is nothing in the
world so excellent, so precious, so sweet, and
so comfortable, as these promises bee: I say,
when he hath done these two, when the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
sayes they are true, and beleeues them,
and when the will saith they are good, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth

<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is come to thee, at that very instant,
hee hath made a <hi>Couenant</hi> with thee, though

the promises are made; but what doth the <hi>Lord</hi>

I would dye that I might haue <hi>Christ,</hi> and his

further, that when thou art come in, thou take
this resolution, now I will serue him, now I
will loue him, now I will obey him, I will bee
content to take <hi>Iesus Christ, for better for worse,</hi>
I will be content to deny my selfe, to take vp
my Crosse, to follow him, in all his wayes.
When a mans spirit hath pondred this well,
when he hath looked on the blood of IESVS
CHRIST, and the promises, and sees himselfe
qualified, vpon this, he sayes, surely these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
belong to mee; this is the witnesse of
the blood: then followes the witnesse of the
water; for the blood hath a double vertue in
it, it hath not onely the vertue to deliuer vs
from the guilt of sinne, to cause the LORD to
passe ouer vs, when he sees the sprinkling of the
blood vpon our hearts, and vpon our persons,
but there is this more, it hath a clensing vertue
in it, cleanseth the conscience from dead
workes; and so hath faith, it hath not onely a
vertue in it, to receiue, and to digest and to take
the promises, but it hath an ability to worke;
as the hand, you know, hath two offices, it hath
an office to receiue, and to take, and likewise
it hath ability to worke: Beloued, these are
neuer disioyned, the blood neuer washeth from
sinne, but likewise it cleanseth the conscience
from dead workes; faith neuer receiues the
promise, but it workes likewise; indeed for the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eceiuing part, wee receiue all alike precious
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2062:214"/>
faith; but for the working part, there is much
difference: you know, a weake hand is able to
receiue, as well as a stronger, but a stronger can
doe more worke: therefore, as faith growes
more, so it workes more. Some man hath a
more working faith then others, though, as it
is a receiuing faith he hath it alike: therefore
thou maist consider this with thy selfe, if I haue
the testimony of the blood, I haue also the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the water, that is a sanctification
ioyned with iustification; <hi>Christ</hi> came not by
blood onely, but by water also: if the spirit of
a man looke on this now, and can say, I see, I
am <hi>renewed in the spirit of my minde,</hi> I see I am
washed from my filthinesse, I see my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is in some measure cleansed from dead
workes, then he may conclude with himselfe,
surely I am in the state of grace, I am in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</hi>
And this, beloued, is the witnesse of
our owne spirits, and the witnesse of the water,
and of the blood. But when this is done, it
may be the LORD continues, yet, at some fits,
to write bitter things against thee, he seemes to
cast thee off, hee seemes to wound thee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
with the wounds of an enemy. This
the LORD many times doth, that he may put
vsto it; hee turnes the deafe eare, that hee
may try what we will doe: when the spirit of
a man hath now these testimonies, and yet
hath not rest, though it haue them on good
ground, (for I meane not the naked spirit of a

First there followes a spirit of prayer,<note place="margin">1. A spirit of prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> that
goes together with it, prayer in the perfection
of it is not a lip labour; no, it is not a putting

it is not a crying to the <hi>Lord:</hi> for other men
may doe so, but it is when a man can come to
<hi>God</hi> with considence, because he knowes him
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2062:216"/>
to bee his Father, because hee hath beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him, because hee hath receiued

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can come
with holy affections to the <hi>Lord,</hi> this is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of prayer; a wicked man, as we shewed out
of <hi>Iob 27.</hi> when <hi>God</hi> comes to him, and rends,
and teares his soule from him; that is, he parts
with his soule vnwillingly, when <hi>God</hi> puls on
the one side, and he on the other, when GOD
puls away his soule, saith he, will the LORD
heare him, when hee cries to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
No: for hee doth not pray, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a cry, a man in extremity may cry hard,
as a thiefe at the Barre, he cryes hard, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loues the Iudge, or hath any confidence
in him, if it were not fot that extremity, hee
would not doe it at all, saith he, he prayeth not,
he doth not delight in the Almighty, hee goes
not to him as to a father, and it appeares hence,
that were there not such an extremity, hee
would not pray, for hee will not pray at all
times.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Loue.</note> it breeds loue; wheresoeuer the
witnesse of the Spirit is, alwayes there followes
it loue, towards <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> for it
cannot bee otherwise, all loue comes from
knowledge; now when a man hath seene <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> indeed, that is, when the <hi>Lord</hi> hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him his owne selfe to him, when hee hath
drawne neere to a man in the witnesse of his
Spirit, when he hath manifested himselfe, it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2062:216"/>
cannot be but a man must loue him. What is
the reason that wee shall loue him perfectly in
heauen, but because we shall know him fully?
any man that knowes him in part heere, loues
him in part; and therefore, if you haue euer
knowne the LORD, that hee hath thus shewed
himselfe, it cannot be but thou shalt loue him.
Besides, loue comes from kindnesse, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of one that hath shewed loue to vs; loue
begets loue, as fire begets fire. Now when
this was thy case, when thou wast a man expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
nothing but death, and hell, and the wrath
of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> hath come, and spoke
kindly vnto thee, as it were, the LORD hath
come and spoken to thee, when thou wast to
die, and hath said, thou shalt liue, when he hath
ouercome thee with kindnesse, as it were, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be now but that thy heart should be affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
towards him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith <hi>Psal 18. Lord
I loue thee dearely;</hi> for, <hi>when I was in distresse
thou didst heare mee;</hi> so when a man hath felt
the terrours of the Almighty, when hee hath
lyen vnder the spirit of bondage, for a time,
when he expected nothing but death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
and the <hi>Lord</hi> hath shewed mercy
and louing kindnesse vnto him, loue will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, likewise; if thou haue the spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it will set thee a worke, to clense thy selfe,
as, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. see a notable place for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
saith hee, <hi>if you haue such promises,</hi> that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2062:217"/>

                  </gap>st; this will certainely follow, thou
wilt clense thy selfe: but if thou finde now,
that thou wallowest in thy lusts, in thy filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that thou art not yet washed from thy
sinnes, and from thy swinish nature, be assured
thou hast not yet applyed the promises, thou
hast not yet the spirit of Adoption, be assured,
if thou hast any hope, it is not a true and liuely
hope, it is but a false and dead hope: for, if it
were a true and a liuely hope, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. it would
set thee aworke to <hi>purge thy selfe,</hi> and therefore
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. you see the difference there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the assurance of faith, and of presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Draw neere in assurance of faith:</hi> What
then? <hi>hauing your hearts sprinkled from an euill
conscience, and your bodies washed in pure water.</hi>
If it be assurance of faith, it hath alwaies this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
with it, the heart is sprinkled from an
euill conscience; but if it bee a presumptuous,
a false assurance, vpon false grounds, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
no such clensing, no such watchfulnesse.
Beloued, this is a sure rule that will not deceiue
you you, those that haue but false flashes of

when <hi>Christ</hi> leads them into his Sellar, as it

of Wine,</hi> that is, with the consolations of

when he hath once tasted of this Wine, his
case is like <hi>Elihuds,</hi> he cannot hold in, but hee
must breake forth into good workes, into holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

an excellent place for this, <hi>Gal. 3. 25. Wherefore
the Law is a Schoolemaster to bring vs to Christ,
that wee might bee made righteous by faith: But

There is no man comes to <hi>Christ,</hi> but
the spirit of bondage is first a Schoolemaster to

then he sues to <hi>Christ,</hi> as a weake Scholler doth
to a Schoolemaster, and desires him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it for him, this brings him to <hi>Christ;</hi> but,
saith hee, when you are once come to <hi>Christ,</hi>
when faith comes, wee are no more vnder a
Schoolemaster, a man neuer comes vnder the
Law againe. But you will obiect, Was it not
<hi>Iobs</hi> case? did not the <hi>Lord</hi> write bitter things
against him, and he was a iust man, and one that
feared <hi>God?</hi> Was it not <hi>Dauids</hi> case? was not
his bones broken, as hee complaines, after the
committing of the sinne of adultery? Doe not
many finde by experience, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath
wounded them sometimes with the wounds of

Beloued, to this I answer, it is very
true, there are some awakings that a man may
haue, a man may be put into a great feare after
he hath receiued the spirit of Adoption, he may
tremble exceedingly at the wrath of <hi>God;</hi> I
say, all this he may doe, yet hee neuer receiues
the spirit of bondage againe, that is, hee neuer
comes to this, to be to <hi>God,</hi> as a seruant is to a
hard Master, but alway this perswasion is in
him, that <hi>God</hi> is his Father, and still hee hath
the affection of a sonne, and still he hath that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,

weares out of him, he neuer comes againe
to looke on <hi>God,</hi> as the Thiefe lookes on the
Iudge, hee neuer comes to be such a stranger
to the <hi>Lord,</hi> so as to flye from him: for the spirit
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2062:220"/>
of bondage is nothing but this, when it makes
a man to feare the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to tremble at him
exceedingly, as a man doth at the wrath of a
Iudge, that thinkes hee will condemne him;
though he may in his extremity say, <hi>Lord,</hi> why
hast thou forsaken mee? yet there goes a secret
spirit of Adoption, that neuer leaues him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
although there be some mixture with
this, to awaken him, and to quicken him, and
to cause him to come home to <hi>Christ:</hi> for that
is the end. Still as a man is brought home by
the spirit of bondage at the first; so, my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

knowledge of GOD wrought in you? Hath
<hi>Christ</hi> so taught you? Marke it well, that from
that knowledge these two things follow; one,
that your heart is circumcised, that the lusts of

thing else, that withall, the lust, the dominion
of sinne is dissolued by that knowledge; that
this knowledge circumciseth the heart, it cuts
off those lusts that did cleaue to vs before. If
thou finde this effect of thy knowledge, now
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath taught thee this knowledge.
You know, <hi>The old man is corrupt, Ephes. 4. 22.

lusts we see what they are, <hi>Iob. 2.</hi> all lusts are

lusts arise from errour, so they are dissolued by
truth: Beloued, the roote from which euery
lust growes, is some errour, some mistake; well,

               <p>As for example, to giue you an instance of

it is but the sight of the eye, <hi>Ecclesiast. 5.</hi>
What is the reason that men loue riches? that
they seeke them, and heape them vp aboue
measure? It is because a man is deceiued, he
thinkes there is such a worth in riches, and
that they will stand him in such a stead, hee
hath a high opinion of them, and thence
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2062:221"/>
comes a man to desire them so much; from
hence ariseth this lust of the eye: Now, when
<hi>Christ</hi> teacheth a man that there is no such
thing in riches, hee is but deceiued, hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
him to looke on them as <hi>Paul</hi> did. hee

man that they are nothing; Why wilt thou
set thy heart vpon that which is nothing? <hi>Pro.
23.</hi> All the men in the world are not able to
teach this, till <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> hath taught it to a
man, but when hee hath taught it him, I say,
the lust is dissolued, there is an end of it, hee
doth no more seeke wealth in that manner as
hee did, he sets no more that price vpon it as
hee did, hee thinkes how he may doe good
with it, how h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,
and applause of men, all things of that
nature; What is the reason that this lust rules
and captiuates a man? Beloued, it is because
hee thinkes that there is an excellency in these
things, but when CHRIST hath taught him,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2062:222"/>
when hee hath written the New <hi>Couenant</hi>
within him, when hee hath written his Law
in his heart, when hee hath taught him with
his owne teaching, hee beginnes to see a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in all these things, as the Apostle saith; the
praise of men is empty glory, the applause of
men, that pleased him before, he lookes now
vpon it, as a bubble blowne with the breath of
men, an empty thing; hee esteemes it a thing
that quickly liues and dyes, and vanisheth hee
seekes no more after it. And so for <hi>the lusts of
the flesh;</hi> when a man before thought it the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life for a man to satisfie the flesh, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of it, now hee beginnes to looke on it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and the bit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to see, that <hi>fleshly lusts fight against the

then a two-edged Sword. Now when GOD
hath enlightned a man thus, and hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his Lawe in his heart, and hath taught
him that hee iudgeth so of his sinnes, and lusts,
now his sinnes and lusts are dissolued in him,
his heart is circumcised. now they are cut off,
now the building of Satan is pulled downe;
and yet beloued, this is but one part of this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not onely this, but likewise there
followes this, further, when <hi>Christ</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his Law in the heart, that man hath not
onely his heart weaned from all the finfull

lusts that before he delighted in, but there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

to the Law of <hi>God,</hi> to keepe it; there is
a wondrous desire to grow in grace, to doe
the duties of new obedience, that by his good
will hee would liue in another Element. But
in doing the duties, and vsing the meanes, by
which he may receiue strength to doe them;
beloued, when that Law is out of the heart,
when wee looke vpon the letter of the Law,
there is no such matter; but when it is put into
the heart, when it is written within, there is
an inward disposition and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it? but when thou hast it put into thy heart,
that is the grace of loue, (for that is to put the

hee shall taste of fearefull Iudgements if hee

this <hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace preached vnto you, and

but this benefit you haue by the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that now this good newes is come to
your eares; Beloued, this <hi>God</hi> brings home to
the Gentiles, and they haue their seuerall
times, and this is the season that <hi>GOD</hi> hath
brought it home to you, euen when you heare
these promises of Grace made. And what vse
should you make of it? surely this.</p>
               <p>Take heede of refusing the acceptable time,<note place="margin">Take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</note>
take heed of not comming in when the doore
of Grace is open; take heede of doing as the
foolish Virgins did, they would come, and
came, but they stayed still the doore was shut
vpon them: Beloued, there is a certaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
time, as we say to you, when <hi>God</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
grace, and after he offers it no more, as wee
told you, the time of this life is the time that we
can propound, we know no other; but there
are certaine secret times, that <hi>God</hi> reserues to
himselfe, that none knowes, but himselfe, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2062:224"/>
when that time is past ouer, hee offers it no
more. You know, those in the Wildernesse,
they liued many yeeres after, and therefore it
was not the time of this life to them, after <hi>God</hi>
had sworne in his wrath: therefore, I say, take
heede of deferring; it is an exceeding dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing; beloued, delay in all things is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
but procrastination in taking the offer
of Grace, is the most dangerous thing in the
world: beloued, we know not what we doe
when we doe it. I beseech you, consider it seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
it is that that deceiues all the world, they
thinke to doe it to morrow, to morrow, though
they be not come in, yet they will doe it, and
doe it speedily: take heed you bee not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in this, I will doe it now, and now, <hi>Modò,
&amp; modò, &amp;c.</hi> The Charriot wheeles, when
they runne, the second runnes neere the first all
the day long, but neuer ouertakes it; as in a
Clocke, the second minute followes the first,
but it neuer ouertakes it; so it is with vs, this
doing of it, now, and now, and to morrow,
and to morrow, these little distances deceiue
vs and delude vs: we thinke to doe it in a short
time, and by reason of the neerenesse and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the time, that we shall doe it easily, that
we can take hold of that time; but it is not so,
we are deceiued and deluded with it: as Grasse-hoppers
and Butter flies deceiue children, when
they thinke to lay their hand vpon them, they
hoppe a little further, and a little further, that
in the conclusion, they take them not at all; so
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2062:225"/>
it is with vs, we coozen our selues in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we lose our life, wee lose our opportunity
of taking grace, because wee thinke it to bee so
neere, we thinke we can take it the next weeke,
or the next moneth, and out of this we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
it is in our power, we may take it. No,
my beloued, for the most part wee are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
when we thinke it so neere, it may flye
away, so that thou shalt neuer haue part in it.
you see how <hi>God</hi> dealt with men in the first <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,</hi>
I meane in the time of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you see, when they would not take the
offer, how <hi>God sware in his wrath, that they should
not enter into his rest;</hi> and I am f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly perswaded,
that in this New Testament, in these dayes of
Grace, the <hi>Lord</hi> is much more quicke and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
in reiecting men, and casting them off,
the time is shorter, he will not wait so long as
hee was wont to doe in those times, hee will
sooner sweare in his wrath now that you shall
not enter in to his rest; that I speake vpon this
ground, saith hee, if the <hi>Lord</hi> would doe this
for the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> how much more, <hi>if wee
neglect so great saluation, as was preached by the
Sonne himselfe?</hi> as the mercy is much greater
now in the new <hi>Couenant,</hi> then it was then, so
the wrath and danger is greater in refusing:
therefore when we consider what a hazard it
is, my beloued, me thinkes, the doubt, and the
brittlenesse of this life, the vnsearchablenes, and
certainety of <hi>Gods</hi> seasons, and times, that hee
hath put into his owne power, the liberty of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2062:225"/>
the Spirit, that breatheth where and when it
listeth, the exceeding danger that we precipitate
our selues into, when we lose the opportunity
once, me thinkes these should moue vs to come
in, and to take heed of refusing the offer at any
time; those expressions you shall finde so often
in the Scripture, that <hi>God stands and knocks;</hi> that
he <hi>waites, and stretcheth forth his hands;</hi> that hee
will <hi>gather</hi> vs, <hi>as a henne gathereth her chickens;</hi>
signifie these two things to vs: First, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ready <hi>God</hi> is to receiue vs, if we come
in, while the acceptable time lasteth.</p>
               <p>Againe, withall, how dangerous it is to refuse
it: for who knowes how long the LORD will
waite? who knows when he will cease waiting,
and shut vp the doore of grace to vs? and then
when the day of peace is gone, it is no more to
be recouered, when the acceptable time is past.
I beseech you therefore, consider and apply it,
take heed of refusing, when you heare yet this
<hi>Couenant</hi> of Grace is offered, your doores are
now open, you may come in, if you will; take
heed of staying till the acceptable time is past,
lest the <hi>Lord</hi> sweare in his wrath (at a time when
you thinke not) that thou shalt neuer enter into
his rest. So much shall serue for this. Beloued,
that which I intended most was this, the reason
why this <hi>Couenant</hi> is made, the reason why <hi>God</hi>
makes a <hi>Couenant</hi> with man; which was chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we might haue strong consolations, that
we might know his good will towards vs, that
he might not onely doe vs good, but that hee
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2062:226"/>
make it manifest to vs. Of this likewise wee
should haue made some vse, which is the laying
hold of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> the promises of free Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
the promises of Sanctification, and the
promises of such blessings as belong to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life, those are the three parts of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
we should haue shewed how wee should
lay hold of them, that when the <hi>Lord</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
once, when faith hath a promise to cloze
with, when it hath such a ground to set footing
vpon, then to apply them, and if the <hi>Lord</hi> defer
to performe them, then to put him to it, for the
fulfilling of them; and so wee should doe for
the promise of Iustification, the promise of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of sinnes, that you haue cause to make
vse of this time when you receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For what doe you? You come to renew
your Couenant with <hi>God,</hi> that wee haue now
spoken of: for it is the seale of the Couenant;
there is a Couenant that <hi>God</hi> makes with you,
and a Couenant that you make with him: when
you consider this, you should strengthen your
faith, goe to him, and say, <hi>Lord,</hi> thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to forgiue me my sinnes, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them no more; <hi>Lord,</hi> it is a part of thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant;
<hi>Lord,</hi> it is thy Couenant that thou hast
put thy seale to; (for the seale is put to it for that
very purpose, that when you see the Bread and
Wine, you might thinke of these seales, as signes
of the Couenant) you haue <hi>Gods</hi> owne Word,
besides, as you haue his Word, that the raine
shall no more drowne the Earth, <hi>God</hi> hath set
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2062:226"/>
his Bow in the Cloud, that when he lookes, he
may remember the <hi>Couenant:</hi> so likewise,
you shall sprinckle the doore posts with the
blood of the Lambe, that when the destroying
Angell shall come and see the blood, hee may
passe you ouer: beloued, after the same manner,
for the same end, <hi>God</hi> hath appointed the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
now when you receiue those elements of
Bread and Wine, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body; and
drinke, this is my blood, which was shed for you, and
for many:</hi> you may goe to <hi>God</hi> vpon the same
ground, and say to him, <hi>Lord,</hi> thou hast made a
Couenant with me, to forgiue me, to receiue me
to thy mercy; <hi>Lord,</hi> these are the seales of thy
Couenant, that if thou forget them, thou hast
said, that if we doe but shew thee those signes,
(for it is the seale that <hi>God</hi> himselfe hath put to
it) thou wilt remember thy Couenant, &amp; make
it good: therefore is is an exceeding great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
to you, when you looke vpon them,
when you may say to the <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> here is thy
seale, that thy selfe hath put, I beseech thee, look
vpon it, and remember thy Couenant that thou
hast made. And as wee should doe thus for the
promises of Iustification, so for the promises of
Sanctification: suppose there be a strong lust
hang vpon thee, an hereditary disease, a lust that
is naturall to thee, that thou thinkest thou shalt
neuer be able to ouercome, yet <hi>God</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to breake the dominion of euery sinne,
that he will crucifie <hi>the flesh, with the affections
of it,</hi> that he will sanctifie thee throughout. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2062:227"/>
you must beleeue those promises of
Sanctification, as well as of Iustification: for
certainely, where the Scripture hath a mouth to
speake, faith hath an eare to heare, and a hand
to receiue: therefore when you grapple with a
strong lust, goe to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and say to him, I am
not able to keepe this Commandement, I feele
this temptation is too strong for me, I find such
strong naturall inclinations, that I am not able
to out-wrestle; <hi>Lord,</hi> it is a part of thy <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

thou hast said thou wilt circumcise my heart,
thou hast said, thou wilt <hi>put thy Law into my
inward parts,</hi> thou hast said, thou wilt dissolue
these lusts, I beseech thee to doe it; <hi>Lord,</hi> thou
art able to doe it, as <hi>Christ</hi> was able to heale he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
diseases, so the Spirit is able to heale
the hereditary diseases of the soule, those that
are most naturall to vs, those that are bred and
borne with vs, and therefore trust him. And so
likewise for any other blessing, go to him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
blessing thou needest, it is a part of <hi>Gods

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2062:230"/>
place is excellent for this purpose; <hi>The Lawe
continued till Iohn Baptist, the Law came by Moses,
but grace and truth came by Iesus Christ.</hi> Marke
it, <hi>grace and truth.</hi> What was the reason there
was more grace dispersed by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> than
by <hi>Moses?</hi> The reason is, because there was
more truth reucaled to the sonnes of men by
CHRIST, then there was by <hi>Moses;</hi> truth was
hid in <hi>Moses</hi> time vnder vailes, and shaddowes,
but was manifest in the time of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
Now because truth was more reuealed by him,
hence it was, that there was a greater communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of grace, a larger effusion of the Spirit,
because there is more truth: but that place
comes as neere to this purpose, that you shall
finde,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 16.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. you shall see there an expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the difference betweene the two Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants:
<hi>Neuerthelesse when their hearts shall bee
turned to the Lord, the vaile shall bee taken from
before their eyes.</hi> Hee said before, <hi>To this day
when Moses is read, there is a vaile laid ouer their
hearts, but when their hearts shall be turned to the
Lord, the vaile shall bee taken away:</hi> And what
then? <hi>They shall behold as in a glasse the glory of
God, with open face, and be transformed</hi> and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>into the same Image, from glory to glory, as by
the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> The meaning is this;
saith he, in the time of the Old Testament there
was a vaile, that couered their hearts, and their
eyes, that they were not able to see the truth
cleerely; but now, saith he, that vaile is tooke
away, and we see the truth with open face, euen
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2062:231"/>
as you see an Image in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Glasse. But what is the

                  </gap>e? Now the vaile is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, we know much more, saith hee, by
seeing with open face, we are transformed into
the same Image, that is, by the knowing of it,
by looking vpon it, by renewing those truths
that are deliuered in the Gospell, by seeing the
wayes of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the Image of GOD there
described, and set forth to vs; by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we are transformed and changed into the
same Image, from glory to glory; that is, from
one glorious degree of that Image to another;
not that the very knowledge shall doe it, but it
pleaseth the LORD to accompany that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by the Spirit; this is done, saith hee, as
by the Spirit of the LORD. So, my beloued,
the way to grow in grace, and in strength, to
receiue that immediate benefit of the <hi>Couenant,</hi>
is to grow in knowledge,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. it is a part of
<hi>Christs</hi> prayer, vers. 17. <hi>Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie them with thy
truth, thy Word is truth.</hi> The meaning is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as if he should haue said, Oh <hi>Lord,</hi> I know, that
the way to sanctifie them, the way to increase
grace and holinesse in their hearts, is to reueale
more truth to them; now, <hi>Lord,</hi> I beseech thee,
reueale thy Word to them; for thy Word is
that truth, teach them to know thy Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with it more and more; for by
that meanes they shall get grace and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So then, if you would receiue the strength
of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> you must labour to grow in
knowldge, labour to vnderstand it more and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2062:231"/>
more: for, beloued, this is a very sure rule,
there is not a new notion that a man gets, there
is not a beame of truth, of new truth, there is
not a further enlargement of knowledge, and
illumination, but it brings some riches of grace
with it, it comes not empty, but it comes loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with something, it hath some power, and
strength, and it giues a new vigour to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man; and therefore if thou wouldest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in grace, study the Scriptures, much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to them, much meditate in them day and
night, labour still to get some new sparke of
knowledge, some new light out of them, and
thou shalt finde this, that grace will follow, as
it is the Apostles exhortation to <hi>Timothie,</hi> saith
he <hi>Giue attendance to reading, and to learning, so
thou shalt saue thy selfe, and shalt be able also to saue
others.</hi> The meaning is, the way to get that
grace that will saue a man, is to giue much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
to reading and to learning: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
whatsoeuer it is that begets a man, the
increase of that likewise edifies and builds him
vp further. First, <hi>we are begotten by the word of
truth,</hi> it is the reuelation of the truth of GOD
to a man at the first, that <hi>renewes him in the spirit
of his minde,</hi> it changeth his iudgement, it makes
him thinke all things in a cleane other fashion
then he was wont to doe: thus he is begotten
to <hi>God,</hi> and he is made a new man, a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
now the increasing of the same truth,
that is it that builds vs vp further: for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
begets, the increase of that also edifies; and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2062:232"/>
hence it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> so exceedingly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
wisdome and knowledge: <hi>aboue all getting,</hi>
saith he, <hi>get that.</hi> There are many things that
are precious in the world, Pearle, Gold, and
Siluer, but this is beyond them all. Why doe
you thinke the Wiseman would magnifie wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
so much? Because this wisdome brings
grace with it; and therefore when <hi>Christ</hi> is said
to be the <hi>light of the world,</hi> he is said likewise to
be the <hi>life:</hi> the light he was, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. and, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
8. <hi>he is the true light, that lightens euery man.</hi>
And what is that light? Why, it is that light
that brings life together with it, Therefore,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note>
                  <hi>Eph. 5. 14. Arise thou that sleepest, &amp;c. and Christ
shall giue thee light.</hi> Now, you know, life is
contrary to death, but the Apostle expresseth
it thus, CHRIST shall giue thee light; because
when a man hath much light, hee shall withall
haue much life and grace: and therefore this I
will commend to you, as one of the principall
meanes of all other to grow strong in grace,
and in the inward man, to grow much in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Beloued, it is another thing then wee
are aware of: if we were fully perswaded that
it were a thing so excellent, that it would bring
so much grace with it, certainely wee would
study it more then we doe:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. saith
hee, <hi>You haue escaped the filthinesse of the world,
through the knowledge of Christ.</hi> That is, that
that deliuers you from the bondage of sinne,
that which enables you to <hi>escape the filthinesse
that is in the world,</hi> when other men are yet
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2062:232"/>
tangled with it, it is because you know that,
that other men are ignorant of, it is through the
knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> if you haue escaped; and,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace be multiplyed through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and of his Sonne Iesus Christ.</hi> Grace
be multiplyed through that knowledge, as if
he should say, multiply you that knowledge, &amp;
this is that meanes whereby Grace shall bee
multiplyed to you.</p>
               <p>That you may see the ground of all this, there
is no grace that any man hath, but it passeth
in through the vnderstanding: For example,
What is the reason that any man loues GOD
more then another, but because <hi>God</hi> is presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his vnderstanding in another maner then
he is to another? hee knowes <hi>God</hi> better then
others; and so for other graces. Why is one
man patient, when another is not, but because
his vnderstanding is enlightned to iudge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the euill he suffers, than another doth?
hee reckons them not so great and intolerable
euils, he sees another hand of prouidence, hee
sees another end in it. And so, What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
one is temperate, and sober, and meeke,
when another is not, but because he hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
iudgement of pleasures and delights? he
lookes vpon them, as on things that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to his soule, he sees a vanity and an empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in them, that another doth not; I say, all
the grace that a man hath, it passeth through
the vnderstanding; and therefore if a man
would be strong in grace, let him labour to get
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2062:233"/>
much light, to get much truth, much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in his minde: for certainely all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene Christians, the difference of
stature betweene men in Christianity, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of degrees, as one man hath a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of faith, and another a lower degree, it
followes from hence, that one is more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he hath more knowledge, hee hath more
truth reuealed to him, which truth carries grace
with it.</p>
               <p>What is the reason that <hi>Paul</hi> exceeded other
men in grace?</p>
               <p>Because there was more truth reuealed to
him then to other men: but still remember that
I deny not, but that there may be much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without grace; but this is a sure rule, there
cannot bee much grace without knowledge.
the reason why any man is strong in grace, and
able to doe that which another is not able to
doe, that he is able to goe through those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and those crosses that another shrinkes at,
hee is able to ouercome those lusts that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not able to grapple with, it is still the
strength of his knowledge, that hee hath more
vnderstanding of things, that hee is better and
more enlightned: <hi>Ioh. 16.</hi> when the Apostles
were to come into the world, and CHRIST

haue, they beginne to bee exceeding fearefull,

Satan building vp <hi>strong holds,</hi> in their deceipts

goe alone without my Spirit, truly you might
besiege the City, you might vse your spirituall
Armour, but you should doe no good; but I
will send my Spirit that shall conuince, (the
word in the Originall signifies the refuting of
an opinion that men had before drunke in,
and were possessed of) the end of the Spirit is to
sanctifie men; now what is that way that the
Spirit vseth to sanctifie men? It is to weare out
those old opinions, to confute them, to let men
know they were exceedingly deceiued. Alas,
they did not know that they were so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
sinfull as they bee, but when the Spirit
comes, he shewes them what natures they haue,
and what liues they haue liued, they know they
are other creatures then they imagined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

that is, the Spirit shall shew men the

but shall blow that sparke, he shall put new fuell
to that sparke till it ouercome, till hee haue
brought forth this beginning of Iudgement, or
integrity, or sanctification, to victory; that is,
to get the victory ouer sinfull lusts: now this
is done by conuincing, by dealing with the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstanding,
it is the worke of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
with the minds of men. Now, beloued, the
vse you may make of it is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If this bee the
way by which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> sanctifies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth,
and communicates to the hearts of men,
the graces of his new <hi>Couenant,</hi> if it bee by the
altering of the opinions of mens vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the way then that thou must take to grow
excellent, to grow strong in grace, is to grow
much in knowledge, to study the Scriptures
much, and therefore let not this exhortation
be in vaine to you, make this vse of it, still to
<hi>meditate in the Law of God day and night,</hi> still to
doe somewhat therein, to be trading therein, to

this word, and stay vpon it, as the Bee doth

got somewhat out of it; if you be still digging
in this Mine, here is enough, it is a large, it is a
deepe Mine, this would make you rich in
knowledge, and if you be rich in knowledge, it
will make you rich in grace likewise: it is the
expression that is vsed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 5.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Therefore be
assured of this, we haue many businesses to doe
in this world, and euery man bestowes himselfe
on something, he spends his time, and placeth
his intentions some where: now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world that you can bestowe it so
profitably on, as to get n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w light daily; get
new truths: if a man gather knowledge of other
things, they are but trifles; and yet that is a
thousand times beyond the gathering of
wealth, but yet that is nothing to the other
knowledge, it is beggerly, and impotent, and
poore, as the Apostle saith: for the things
themselues are poore. Is there any thing in the
world can helpe a man to happinesse to any
purpose? if the things cannot doe it, the
knowledge cannot bee better then the thing.
I say, the best naturall thing you can doe is to
gather wisdome, that will serue for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life, but to get that wisdome that will
build you vp in grace, that will make you
strong in CHRIST, that is farre more to bee
chosen; remember that which <hi>Salomon</hi> saith,
that <hi>it is aboue Pearles,</hi> and that is not enough
to expresse it; but, saith hee, goe through all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2062:235"/>
the precious things in the world, it goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them; Why? because it exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
grace; And what is the profit of it?
It makes <hi>God</hi> to set a high esteeme of you, it
makes the mighty <hi>God,</hi> who is able onely to
doe thee good, to delight in thee, it makes
him ready to doe thee much good; which I
gather out of that <hi>Heb. 8.</hi> saith the LORD there,
<hi>When I tooke your Fathers by the hand, and led
them out of Egypt,</hi> saith hee <hi>they broke my Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and I regarded them not, saith the LORD;
marke it, <hi>but I will make another</hi> kinde of <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with you.</hi> Now, by the rule of contraries,
these men had little knowledge, and by that
meanes, they had no strength, and therefore
they broke the <hi>Couenant</hi> of the LORD, and
therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> regarded them not, but cast
them away, as you refuse things: on the other
side now, there is much knowledge, that brings
men much grace, that makes them keepe the
<hi>Couenant</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in a greater measure; if hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not them that brake the <hi>Couenant,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
now he will regard them that keepe the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> those that are his peculiar people, the
men of his delight, the men whom he loues,
vpon whom hee meanes to bestowe all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
they are fauourites to the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
this you shall haue, if you excell in grace,
there are many other benefits, but still, I say,
remember this; if thou wouldest haue much
grace, reade the Scriptures exceeding much,
make it thy chiefest study from day to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2062:235"/>
day enquire into them, if thou canst liue vnder
a good Minister, that is liuely, and powerfull,
and enlightning, set a higher price vpon him
then thou hast done; if thou hast an estate,
spare nothing for thy soules good: for if wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
be better then Gold, and Siluer, why
should you not part with them for it? and so

is taken away, then the <hi>Couenant</hi> is disannulled
betweene <hi>God</hi> and vs, but till then the <hi>Couenant</hi>
remaines sure. Now, what is it that makes the
<hi>Couenant?</hi> Marke it, This is that that makes
the <hi>Couenant,</hi> when <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> offers himselfe
to vs, and makes knowne his consent, he is the
promised <hi>seede, in whom all the Nations of the
Earth shall be blessed;</hi> when wee againe come,

a full consent to this, when the heart hath thus
tooke the promised seede, and receiued him,
and lookes for all from him, now the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

Now, beloued, as long as this vnion continues
betweene CHRIST and vs, the Couenant is
not disannulled; so that, in a word, the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2062:236"/>
is neuer nullified, vntill thou hast chosen
to thy selfe another husband, till thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

there may be many failings of a Wife towards
her Husband, many neglects, many disobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
many fits of passion, many offences shee

a point exceeding full of comfort: thou must

she doth them, but not with loue, and delight,
she doth them not with cheerefulnesse and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse,
she would be free: if thou finde this

is stolne away with any thing in the world,
with matter of estate, pleasures, or whatsoeuer

set vpon, any haunt, any delight, any lust that

               <p>You must know this, beloued, that a godly

though he faile exceedingly in many things,
yet his delight is still in the LORD, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

that if it could be, (I make that supposition) if
there were such a proposition as there was in
the old Law, euery seuenth yeere, those that
had serued an Apprentiship, that were bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaues,
they might goe free, yet we see some so
loued their Masters, that they would not goe

adultery with any thing in the world, let
him haue such a Proclamation, that hee might
goe free, he would, were it not for the losse of
heauen, and for going to hell, (but suppose it
were free to him) hee would goe free with all
his heart, he would choose another Master, and
would be free from that bondage, (for so hee
accounts it;) but he that loues the LORD, will
not goe free if he might: for hee reckons that
seruice the greatest freedome, and delight, hee
had rather liue in His Family, then in any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
in the world; it is not a seruice, but a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
it is a marriage, he liues as a sonne in the

is such a disposition put into his heart, there is

his inward parts, that he longs after the LORD,
as looke what disposition and inclination there
is in the Loadstone, in lingering after the Iron,
if you pull it from it a thousand times, still it
lookes after it, and it cannot choose, it is the
disposition of the Iron: so, such a disposition
there is in the seruants of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to chuse him
for their <hi>Lord,</hi> and Husband; and it is not an
empty choice, that c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or in the naked resolution of the mind, but it is
such a choice as hath strong affections running
together with it, a strong inclination carrying
the soule to him, so that though he be hindered
many times, and often in his life, vnruly lusts
come, and make a separation betweene the
LORD and him, yet he cannot abide to bee
long from him; it is the <hi>Lord</hi> that hee loues,
he cannot for his heart choose another Master,
hee cannot choose another Husband, another
<hi>Lord,</hi> another friend, but it is hee with whom
he will dwell, liue, and dye: if this be thy case,
know, that thy continuall failings make not a
breach of the <hi>Couenant:</hi> for thou knowest that
thy heart hath not chosen another Husband:
for though thou be forced sometimes, through
the violence of temptation to serue another, yet
thy heart cleaues to thy right Master, it cleaues

               <p>No,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> beloued, that is not the meaning of it,
but take heed of this, when a sinne is drawne
out as a thread in the course of thy life, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
thou obeyest it, now thou art ouercome
of it, now it hath dominion whensoeuer it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
thee; when there is, I say, a tract of
sinne, when a man is still giuen to such a way,
to such an infirmity, (I cannot properly call it
an infirmity) that you may say it is such a mans
trade, he walkes in it, now a man obeyes sinne,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2062:239"/>
he is ouercome of it, it hath gotten the victorie
ouer him; as we vse to say of men, he is a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded
man, goe to him when you will,
you shall finde him so disposed, you shall finde
him in all his carriage to shew himselfe to bee
such a man, this sinne it runnes as a thread
through his whole life, still he mindes earthly
things, he is taken vp about them, he disrelish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Word, he doth not minde it, hee doth
not delight to reade it, or to heare it, hee doth
not loue the company of the Saints, and the
like; and so for any other sinne. If this will
not serue the turne, thou maist iudge it by one
sinne, but that is somewhat more difficult: I will
giue you 3. examples, you shall see <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<hi>Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> you shall see euery one of
them in one sinne breake the <hi>Couenant,</hi> and if
you can finde yours the same case, you shall
know whether you haue broken it by one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.
Take <hi>Saul</hi> first, he was commanded to
goe and kill the <hi>Amalekits,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> would haue
him destroy them vtterly; <hi>Saul</hi> goes about his
Commandement, he seemes to keepe it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
well, and where he failed in it, he seemed to
haue a faire excuse, saith he, I did but saue the
King, the whole body of the people was destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
again, he saued but a few of the fattest of the
cattell, and for what purpose? not for his owne
profit, to make him rich, but to offer sacrifice to
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and he hoped there was no fayling in
this. Well, saith <hi>Samuel, thou hast cast away the
Lord,</hi> thou hast chosen another <hi>God. Samuel</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:2062:240"/>
charged him with no lesse; for, saith hee, thy
<hi>sinne is as witchcraft,</hi> it is as Idolatry, that is, thou
hast now cast <hi>God</hi> quite away, thou hast chosen
to thy selfe another <hi>Lord,</hi> another Husband
to obey, How shall this be made good? The
meaning is this, when a man receiues a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
from <hi>God,</hi> (marke it) when a man
knowes it is the <hi>Lords</hi> will, that I should walke
thus, and thus before him, that I should abstaine
from such and such sinnes, I cannot deny but
this is his Commandement; well, when a man
comes to the keeping of it, &amp; his heart finds out
excuses, and saith in such and such a case, I hope
I may be somewhat excused from a strict per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it; I say, when the heart at any
time deliberates, and yet that word is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to expresse it, but when the heart workes
according to its owne proper inclination, and
then disobeyes the <hi>Lord</hi> in any Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
certainely then it casts <hi>God</hi> away. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
it is not such disobedience, as when a man
is transported with a strong affection, a strong
temptation, when he is not himselfe for a time,
and his sinne be discouered, he easily returnes,
and will be the same man he was; but, I say,
when a man deliberately commits sinne, when
a man considers himselfe well, and hee is not
transported with the strength of temptation,
but his heart workes at liberty, so that hee acts
himselfe, in this case he doth as <hi>Saul</hi> did, hee
casts <hi>God</hi> away, and <hi>God</hi> sent him word that he
had cast him away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:2062:240"/>The like was the case of <hi>Balaam,</hi> hee carried

committing fornication with their women; and
so, saith he, I shall be able to curse them, when
they haue committed sinne once, then I may
curse them to purpose. I say, there was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
the proper inclination of <hi>Balaams</hi> heart,
it was not a thing that he was drawne to; but
when his heart was left to it selfe, to goe which
way it would, that way it went: it is not so
with a man that is in the <hi>Couenant:</hi> for grace,
it still preuailes, and hath power ouer him, it is
that which hath dominion and possession, it is
that which is the Lord of the house, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he is lest simply to himselfe, that his heart
workes which way it would, certainely then he
pleaseth <hi>God,</hi> he cannot, he doth not sin against
him. I cannot stay to presse this further, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come to make some vse of it; but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,

he might thinke thus with himselfe, alas, what
can this poore and beggerly Ceremony doe, to
deliuer me from the conscience of my sinne?
Well, saith the Apostle, we haue another kind
of Sacrifice, and another kinde of Priest,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb. 7.
We haue such an High Priest, as is able perfectly to
saue those that come to him:</hi> And why? <hi>For,</hi> saith
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2062:242"/>
he, <hi>he is gone, not into the Tabernacle, as the other
Priests, but he is entred into the very heauens.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
saith he, <hi>he goes not once a yeere, as they did,
but he liues for euer to make intercession for vs, hee
is not gone with the blood of Buls and Goates, but
with his owne blood, he is a High Priest, holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
vndefiled, separated from sinners, higher then
the heauens,</hi> and therefore doubt not but <hi>hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perfectly to saue those that come vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloued, consider this, it is the very Vse that
the Apostle makes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 28.</note> saith he, seeing
these things are so, since we haue such an High
Priest as we haue described, since it is the very
Sacrifice of his blood it selfe, <hi>let vs draw neere
in the assurance of faith;</hi> that is, if the conscience
of any sinne lye vpon vs, let vs not goe to <hi>God</hi>
with a quarter wind, or w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

You must thinke so of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> hee
would haue you thinke so, and conceiue of him,
that he is now in heauen, that he is able perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> you, that there is nothing you haue
committed, that can doe you hurt; he is like a
friend in the Court; if a man were sure that hee
had one that were neuer from the King, that
hath his eare continually, that is alway in his
presence, that is such a Fauourite, of such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
with him, that certainely he can deny him
nothing, a man would be secure: put the case
there were some whispering fellows that would
be ready to informe against him, yet, saith hee,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2062:242"/>
I haue one there, that will be ready to take care
for me. My beloued, this is thy very case. <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> is gone to Heauen, it is a thousand times
better for thee, that he should be there, then that
he should be here in this world still, there he is
thy Attorney, as it were, he takes care of thee,
hee sees all the accusations that are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, and he is ready to answer for thee,
saith the Text, he makes intercession, if there
come any thing that tends to make a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>God</hi> and thee, he is the Mediator for thee,
he dwels there for that end, if there be any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
any breach comes, that he may make it
vp betweene <hi>God</hi> and thee; consider this, and
when thou hast committed a sin, go to this high
Priest, that is able to saue thee perfectly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that it is a part of his <hi>Couenant,</hi> and so
labour to grow vp in full assurance of faith, that
no conscience of sinne may lye vpon thee, to
make a separation betweene <hi>God</hi> and thee: for,
beloued, you ought to trust perfectly to the
grace that is reuealed through him.</p>
               <p>And as I say for sinne, so in the second place
you are to make vse of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> as put the
case there bee some strong lust, some violent
temptation, that thou art not able to outwrestle,
it is too strong for thee, thou wouldest faine be
rid of it, but thou art not able, why what shalt
thou doe in this case? remember that it is a part
of the <hi>Lords Couenant,</hi> that he will <hi>deliuer thee
from all thine enemies, that thou maist serue him
in righteousnesse and holinesse all the dayes of thy
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2062:243"/>
life.</hi> It is a part of his Couenant to remember it,
he hath sworne to remember it, he hath said he
will <hi>write his Law in thy heart,</hi> and that can neuer
be, without he obliterate all old writing, he hath
said he will giue the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to giue thee a <hi>new heart,</hi> and a <hi>new spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> now
consider this, it is a part of his Couenant, goe to
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and beseech him to make good his
Couenant, this is the way for thee to ouercome
it; if thou go about it any other way, thou shalt
neuer be able to out-wrestle it. Beloued, for a
man to thinke thus with himselfe, to say, I haue
receiued grace, I hope I haue some strength,
therefore I will be bold to venture vpon such a
temptation; or, at least, I hope by my promises,
by my vowes, &amp; prayers, and reading, one way
one way or other to master it, and ouercome it,
this is not the way; thou must goe to GOD, and
make vse of this Couenant, and beseech him to
giue thee strength: for, marke it, GOD would
not take this vpon him, to giue vs new hearts,
and new spirits, to sanctifie vs, to make vs new
creatures, to crucifie the flesh, to weaken the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of sinne, hee would not take this vpon
him, and make a promise, if wee were able to
doe it: but hee knowes it is in his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and he must doe it for vs; and therefore in
such a case we must goe to him, and beseech
him to doe it: for know this, when a man is in
CHRIST once, when he is in the Couenant, he
liues by a principle without himselfe, and not by
one within himselfe, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I liue by Iesus
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2062:243"/>
Christ,</hi> that is, he is without me, and it is he still
that giues me strength, therfore goe to him.</p>
               <p>If you aske the reason, why will the LORD
haue it so? why may not a man haue a sufficient
habituall strength in himselfe, by which he may
be able to out-wrestle lusts, and to ouercome
temptations? The reason is, because no flesh
shall reioyce in it selfe; and therefore <hi>Christ
is made sanctification;</hi> that is, you deriue it from
him, from day to day, from time to time, that
you might not reioyce in your selues, but in
him: therfore let no man goe about such a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
in his own strength: for a man to thinke,
beloued, by vertue of that habituall grace hee
hath receiued, to be able to ouercome sinne,
and to worke righteousnes, it is all one as if a
man should say thus with himselfe, I see my
house is full of light, now I will shut vp my
doores and windowes, I hope to haue light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
when he hath done so, you know, the
light perisheth presently, because the Sun is shut
out, that which giues light: I say, so it is, when
a man thinks, now I am some body, I haue now
gotten some strength, now, I hope, I may walke
with some confidence more then before; this
is to shut vp the windowes, as it were. No, thou
must haue continuall dependence vpon <hi>Christ,</hi>
otherwise, if thou goe to ouercome any sin, and
thinke to doe it with thy owne strength, it shall
be too strong for thee: for you wrestle with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, and without a strength from one
without thee, they will be too strong for thee:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2062:244"/>
goe to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and say, <hi>Lord,</hi> I confesse, I am
able to doe nothing of my selfe, but I bring my
heart to thee, as an empty Caske, beseeching
thee to fill it with grace; <hi>Lord,</hi> I want much
grace, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is full of grace, and hath filled
himselfe for that purpose, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
it to vs: I say, in such a case, now, if
thou goe to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and beseech him to make
good his <hi>Couenant,</hi> tell him thou restest vpon his
strength, thou goest against sinne, as <hi>Iosuah</hi> went
against the <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ites,</hi> not because he was able
to ouercome them: for they were <hi>Giants, and
had cities walled vp to heauen;</hi> but hee went in
the <hi>Lords</hi> strength; I say, if a man goe in this
manner, bee assured that the <hi>Lord</hi> will not faile
thee, he will giue thee ability to ouercome.</p>
               <p>The third case is, when any outward trouble
lyes vpon a man, let him goe and remember it is
a part of <hi>Gods Couenant</hi> to blesse him, To blesse
him with what? Withall kind of blessings, and
to be a Buckler to him; there is no euill in the
world, but <hi>God</hi> hath promised to bee a Buckler
to shield him, and to defend him from it: put
the case thou lye vnder any pressure, any cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
any crosse, any disease, any affliction of
minde, or of body, or estate, or of name, why
goe to <hi>God</hi> now, and tell him it is a part of his
<hi>Couenant</hi> to deliuer thee, and labour to find out,
if thou canst, beside the generall <hi>Couenant,</hi> some
particular. The <hi>Lord</hi> hath said, if thou bee in
trouble, <hi>call vpon mee, and I will deliuer thee;</hi> if
thou be in a strait, in extremity, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2062:244"/>
said <hi>he will worke thy workes for thee,</hi> and so yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
may goe to him in particulars. But when fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
hath once gotten a promise, be sure that thou
keepe thy hold, pleade hard with the <hi>Lord,</hi> and
tell him it is a part of his <hi>Couenant,</hi> and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that he should deny thee; doe as the
woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when thou art on a sure
ground, take no denyall, though the <hi>Lord</hi> may
deferre long, yet he will doe it, he cannot chuse;
for it is a part of his <hi>Couenant.</hi> Beloued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this case, doe, as you see two Metaphors
vsed in Scripture, they are excellent for this
purpose, <hi>Esay 66. 11.</hi> there is a Commandement
of the <hi>Lord</hi> for the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they
should <hi>sucke, and be satisfied with the brests of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
&amp;c.</hi> the words are obscure, as they are
read to you, but the Originall makes them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
cleere; there are two Metaphors vsed,
one is to milke consolation out of the promises,
the meaning is this, that the promises are full
of comfort, as a dugge is full of milke; now, if
thou be ready to faint, goe and milke out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
out of the promises, that will relieue
thee, that will stay thy heart; goe, saith he, and
sucke, draw out consolation from the dugges,
from the promises, (for that is the meaning)
which he cals the brests of consolation (for hee
repeates the promise presently after,) thus saith
the <hi>Lord, behold, I will extend peace ouer her like
a Flood, &amp;c.</hi> The other Metaphor is to extor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
to oppresse the promises, that, as a rich man op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
a poore man, and gets out of him all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2062:245"/>
that he is worth, he leaues him worth nothing,
he playes the extortioner with him; after that
manner deale thou with the promises, for they
are rich, there is a price in them, be thou as an
extortioner to them, take out whatsoeuer thou
needest, or wring it out of the promises, as it
were. Now when a man is poore and needy,
let him goe to the rich promises, and bee as an
oppressor to them, that is, consider the promises
to the vtmost, see the vtmost riches that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them, and they will make thee rich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
draw out the vtmost of that milke that is
in them, and it will exceedingly reuiue &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thee: for example, (that I may a little open
it to you) <hi>Iacob,</hi> when <hi>Esau</hi> met him, and his
heart began to faint, (for, saith the Text, <hi>he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
exceedingly</hi>) his heart began to faile him now,
and what did he? he did goe and sucke conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
out of the promises: for thus he reasons
with the <hi>Lord, Lord, thou hast said thou wilt doe
me good;</hi> now hee stayes himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e vp with this,
and hee got so much strength with this milke,
that hee was able to wrestle with the <hi>Lord</hi> all
night, and would not let him go without a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
this promise sustained him, from whence
he sucked consolation and strength <hi>for thou hast
said thou wilt doe me good,</hi> therfore I am resolued,
I am sure I am vpon good ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I will not let
thee go without a blessing.</hi> And so <hi>Abraham,</hi> when
he was to offer his onely sonne, what should he
doe now? here he was dessolate, poore, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
certainely his heart could not but be ready
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2062:245"/>
to faile, &amp; what should sustaine him in this case?
there was a promise, you see,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. he was
sure <hi>God</hi> had made a promise, and hae said vnto
him, this is <hi>Isaac,</hi> and this <hi>Isaac</hi> I will multiply,
and with him I will establish my <hi>Couenant,</hi> and
<hi>his seede shall be as the Stars of heauen;</hi> saith <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
God</hi> promised it, and though I should kill
him, <hi>God</hi> can put a new life into him; he went,
you know how farre from his house where hee
dwelt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> surely he sustained himselfe by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
he rested vpon this promise, he drew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
from it, and he drew it to the full, there
was much milke in that promise, and that sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and comforted him. I might giue you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
instances. So <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee comforted
himselfe at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> what was it that he comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe in? Surely <hi>Dauid</hi> remembred this,
the <hi>Lord</hi> hath annoynted me King ouer <hi>Israel,</hi>
he hath said that I shall be King, and shall sit in
the Throne of <hi>Saul;</hi> it is true, I haue lost all
that I haue, and the Souldiers that should bee
my strength, are now at this instant ready to
stone me; yet he remembred this promise, and
comforted himselfe in the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is, in the
promise that the <hi>Lord</hi> had made to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this was the maine that he had to comfort
himselfe with.</p>
               <p>Beloued, learne to doe this when you are in
any strait, if there be any thing that you need,
remember this, if thou can but get a promise, if
faith can but get this footing, the LORD hath
made it a part of his Couenant, and there is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2062:246"/>
his hand and seale to it, the Sacrament that thou
receiuest from time to time, is but a seale of that

                  </gap>e will remember it, hee cannot forget it long,
be assured he will performe it, it is impossible
but he should, let not your hearts faile, if thou
haue a promise, he will doe it in due season, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not in thy season, yet he will doe it in
the best manner, though not in that manner and
fashion that thou imaginest.</p>
               <p>Beloued, one thing more we should haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that is, to exhort men to enter into <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi>

you know what a weake creature man is, what

doe in the time of extremity? thou canst not
goe to GOD, thou art not in the <hi>Couenant</hi> with

want the comfort of <hi>God?</hi> No, know, if thou be
not in <hi>Couenant</hi> with GOD, he is thine enemy:
if thou come neere to him for refuge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
he will be to thee as a deuouring fire, and
when thou commest to him, thou shalt bee as

be not in the <hi>Couenant</hi> with him. You will say
to me, this is to come, if it may be well for the

may hurt thee, men may hurt thee, beasts may

if thou be in <hi>Couenant</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> all these are at
peace with thee: for all these are at <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
it is a part of his <hi>Couenant;</hi> when thou
art in <hi>Couenant</hi> and League with him, thou art
in League with them, and therefore they shall
neuer doe thee hurt. Bee assured of that, when
thou art within the Couenant, there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in heauen or earth can doe thee hurt: for
thou art at peace with it, it is not an enemy, and
that which is not an enemy, it neuer doth hurt;
but if thou be not in Couenant with <hi>God,</hi> now
these haue a power to hurt thee, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
vpon them, there is no restraint, but
they may doe thee hurt, they are enemies to
thee, both those things, and whatsoeuer else is
in heauen or Earth; Satan, and euery creature
hath power to doe thee hurt: when thou wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
in the way, when thou sittest in thy house,
wheresoeuer thou art, thou walkest in thee mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

               <p>But this obiection will be made,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Yea, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that are out of the Couenant, liue peaceable
and quiet liues?</p>
               <p>I will answer it in a word;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> It is very true, they
may be exercised, though all the host of heauen
and earth be at peace with them, and there is
not any creature can doe them the least hurt;
no, they neither will, nor can goe about it, to
lift vp their hand against them; yet they may be
exercised with many afflictions, but there is a
very great difference betweene these two, the
same disease, the same griefe, the same appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
lyes on the heart, and wounds the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the one man, but to the other that is in
Couenant, it is a rod in the hand of a father, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
him to keepe his Couenant the better, it
is as a Medicine in the hand of a Physician, to
heale him, to comfort him, to doe him good;
that very disease to another is as a sword in the
hand of an enemy, as poyson in the hand of the
destroyer to hurt him. As, for example, the
Deuill had power to vexe <hi>Saul,</hi> and to vexe <hi>Iob,</hi>
here was the same instrument, the Deuill had
power ouer both, but there was a great deale of
difference, you know, he had power ouer <hi>Saul</hi>
as an enemy, he had power ouer <hi>Iob</hi> as a friend:
and so likewise <hi>Iudas</hi> had a messenger of Satan,
to fill his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2062:248"/>
too, to sollicite him, and to trouble him, and
to ioine with his lusts, to make them as pricks in
his sides, but there is much difference; to the
one he had a restraint, the <hi>Lord</hi> saith to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s far, for what purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as there was a
restraint, so there was another end likewise, so
far it shall goe, as till it hath humbled him; <hi>Iob</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> were humbled by it, a iot further it
cannot goe: for the deuill in truth, though hee
be hostile to them in affection, yet cannot hurt
them in action, because <hi>God</hi> only vseth him to
doe them good, and to humble them; <hi>Iob</hi> was
the better, and <hi>Paul</hi> was an exceeding gainer
by it, but <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> were great Iosets; so
there is a great difference betweene these two.
The Shepheard sets his Dog vpon the Sheep to
bring them in, another man sets his Mastiffe on
another creature to worry it, and to destroy it;
the <hi>Lord</hi> sets the creature vpon his own seruants,
but as the Shepheard sends out his Dogge, to
bring them in; as soone as they are brought in,
he rates the Dog, and will not suffer him to doe
them the least hurt. A man will not haue his
seruants, nor children, nor his friends hurt, but
he will rate the Dog when he fals vpon them;
so the <hi>Lord</hi> doth with euery creature whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
when it comes to hurt them, he rebuker it,
as he did the stormes and winds: on the other
side, when a man is out of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enant</hi> with GOD,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2062:248"/>
then <hi>God</hi> vnlooseth the coller of the creature, as
it were, and sets him vpon such a man, and saith
vnto him, go &amp; worry such a man, wound him,
be an enemy to him, hurt him. This obiection is
so to be answered, that those that are within the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> they are often molested and troubled,
the creatures seeme to hurt them, though they
be in League and at peace with them, and can
doe them no hurt.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is obiected,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that others that are
out of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> they liue in peace?</p>
               <p>Beloued,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> I beseech you, consider this, and it is
profitable to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that he that belongs not to
the <hi>Couenant,</hi> he may liue in his fathers house, he
may sit at Table with the children, he may haue
the same maintenance, the same clothing, the
same vsage, the same liberty, the same priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the family as the children haue, and
yet for all this, this is one that belongs not to
the <hi>Couenant,</hi> but one whom <hi>God</hi> intends to cast
out. <hi>Ismael,</hi> you know, liued in the family, as
well as <hi>Isaac,</hi> and was as well vsed as <hi>Isaac,</hi> till
the time came that <hi>God</hi> would cast him out; and
therefore deceiue not thy selfe with out ward
peace, to say, <hi>God</hi> and the creature are at peace
with me; for I haue prosperity in all that I doe.
No, it may be, the time of casting out is not yet
come, but in due time, when the right season shal
come, then <hi>Ismael</hi> shall bee cast out, and euery
one with whom the <hi>Couenant</hi> indeed is not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
<hi>Caine</hi> remained for a time, but he was
cast out, and made a <hi>Vagabond vpon the earth.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2062:249"/>
Saul</hi> remained for a time in the house, but in
due season <hi>God</hi> cast him off: so, I say, <hi>God</hi> may
nourish, and cherish, and defend thee, as if thou
wert one of his owne children, but he will cast
thee off in the end. We haue a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for it, in his dealing with the children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
they were such as belonged not to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,</hi>
a great part of them, and yet see how
he vsed those very men;<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. it is said, <hi>hee
carried them on Eagles wings;</hi> that is the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is, the <hi>Lord</hi> carried them so safely as the
Eagle carries her yong on the top of her wings,
that no Fowle can reach them, but she is aboue
all Fowles, and stronger then all Fowles, and
flyes higher, and so they were safe as on Eagles
wings, nothing could reach them; After that
manner I carried you out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I kept you
so safe: besides, I did not onely defend you,
but fed you with the finest Wheat, with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Oyle, with the liquor of the Grape; and yet
notwithstanding all this, these men were such
as <hi>God</hi> hated, such as were not in League, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
not to the <hi>Couenant:</hi> deceiue not thy
selfe, <hi>God</hi> may doe all this, and yet cast thee out;
he may feed the with riches in abundance, and
yet if thou be not a sonne, if the <hi>Couenant</hi> be not
established with thee, thou shalt be cast out; the
sonne abides for euer, but hee with whom the
<hi>Couenant</hi> is not made, though he may continue
in the Family for a while, hee shall not abide
long, but shall be cast forth.</p>

which we spake of lately to you;

               </p>
               <p>Here you haue this answer made,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That for a
time all things come alike to all, there is the same
condition to the one, as to the other: the reason
of which you shall see when we come to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the words. But in briefe, to open them to
you: you shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inde, that this was the occasion of
them. In the 16. verse of the former Chapter,
sayth the Wiseman,<note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue applyed my heart vnto
wised<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me, and to behold the busines that is done vpon
the earth, in which I had no rest, either day or night,</hi>
I was so intent vpon them. Well; what is the
conclusion? Sayth he, I found this, I was not able
to finde out the reason of <hi>Gods</hi> workes; <hi>I beheld
the workes of God, that man cannot finde out the
workes that are wrought vnder the Sunne, yea though
a wise man thinke to know it, he cannot finde it:</hi>
That is, when I see how <hi>God</hi> dispenseth things,
I am not able to finde out the reason, and not I
onely, but no man is able to finde it, no, saith he,
though he be a wise man; no, although he search
never so diligently, he cannot find out the reason
of <hi>Gods</hi> wayes, the reason of his providence, of his
dispensing of prosperitie to the wicked, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie
to the godly; yet these two Conclusions
notwithstanding he found, which he expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth in

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that <hi>the iust, and the wise, and their workes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2062:250"/>
are in the hand of the Lord:</hi> That is, although I see
not the reason why <hi>God</hi> doth it, yet this I finde,
it is the <hi>Lord</hi> that disposeth all things, both to
men, and all their workes; All the events that fall
out, both good, and euill, I finde this, that they
are in the hand of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing he found is, That <hi>all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
come alike to all: There is the same condition to the
good, and to the evill, to him that sacrificeth, and to
him that sacrificeth not.</hi> These be the two things,
that the <hi>wiseman</hi> professeth he found out, &amp; from
hence he gathereth two Consectaries.</p>
               <p>One is,<note place="margin">Consectarie.</note> That <hi>there is no man able to know loue, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
hatred, by all that is before him:</hi> That is, by all that
he seeth done to himselfe, or by all that he seeth
<hi>God</hi> doe to other men; he is not able to judge by
that, who it is that <hi>God</hi> loues, or who it is he
hates.</p>
               <p>A second Consectarie from it,<note place="margin">Consectarie.</note> is expressed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the third verse;<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 3.</note> sayth he, <hi>This is an evill I haue
seene vnder the Sunne, that there is one condition to
all:</hi> That is, the sonnes of men when they haue
seene this carriage of things, this administration,
and dispensation of good and evill, thus premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously,
to men of all sorts; therefore, sayth he,
<hi>The hearts of men are full of evill, and madnesse is in
their hearts while they liue:</hi> That is, therefore they
seeke not <hi>God,</hi> but the creature, therefore they doe
not depend vpon him, but seeke to secondaric
meanes; What is the issue of it? <hi>therefore they goe
downe to the dead:</hi> That is, they perish for ever.
So much briefly for the meaning of the words.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2062:251"/>
Now before he comes to deliver these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
he makes this Preamble; <hi>I haue given my
heart,</hi> sayth he, <hi>to all this,</hi> or I bend my selfe with
all my might to this, even to declare these two
things; that all things are in the hand of <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c.
whence we will gather this (in that <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth,
that he bent himselfe, with all his might, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
both to himselfe, &amp; to others, that all things
are in the hands of <hi>God;</hi>) that
<q>It is a very hard thing,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> to be perswaded of

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a very hard thing to be perswaded, that all
things are in the hands of <hi>God,</hi> it is a hard thing to
perswade our selues, it is a hard thing to perswade
others, that is, I shall not deliver the poynt fully
to you, except <hi>God</hi> himselfe teach you, except <hi>God</hi>
himselfe declare it; it is so hard for a man to see all
things in the hands of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,</hi> to know that he is able
to doe all, that, except <hi>God</hi> teach it to a man, he is
not able to know it, that is, he is not able to
know it to purpose, he is not able to know it so,
as to haue the vse of it, he is not able to know it in
a practicall manner, except the <hi>Lord</hi> teach it him.</p>
               <p>The ground of which is: because,<note place="margin">The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> must perswade</note> it belongs to
the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> to perswade, it belongs to <hi>God</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
not onely to perswade this truth to the
hearts of men, but also to perswade all saving
truths of what nature soever; And therefore wee
see when Christ sends out his Disciples, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
he bids them, Goe, preach the Word to the
Iewes, and Gentiles; and whereas they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in that case;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> How shall we be able to perswade
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2062:251"/>
men, that bring a strange doctrine, and strange
newes to them, a strange thing that was never
heard of?</p>
               <p>Christ answers them thus,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> I will send my spirit
with you,<note place="margin">Iohn 16.</note> and <hi>he shall convince the world of sinne,
of righteous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esse, and of ludgement;</hi> As if he should
say, I confesle you are not able to doe it, that is a
worke that onely belongs to the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> and he
shall convince men of their miserable estate out
of Christ, he shall convince them of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
that they are to haue by Christ, he shall
also convince them of holinesse, and sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
vnder Christs government. Thus, sayth he,
the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> shall doe; you are not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it. And so when the <hi>Lord</hi> makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that the people should serue him, and feare
him: The question is, how they should be able to
doe it; shall the Prophets be able to perswade
them? shall the Apostles in their times be able to
perswade them? No; sayth he, <hi>They shall all be
taught of God;</hi> As if he should say, without his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
it will be all in vaine; but if the <hi>Lord</hi> teach
them once, they shall be perswaded effectually,
they shall not onely know what their dutie is, but
they shall be readie to performe it.</p>
               <p>The reason of which is;</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> because <hi>God</hi> onely is the generall,<note place="margin">God onely wise, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to perswade.</note> and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
worker, he onely is vniversally wise, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowes all things, and therefore he onely is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to teach all things; men know but in part, and
therefore they are able to teach but in part, (now
he that is perswaded of a thing but in part, though
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2062:252"/>
he may acknowledge the thing to be good, yet
his heart is not wrought to practice it; for there is
something yet behinde, some objections, that are
not yet answered.) It is onely <hi>God</hi> that hath an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
light, that is a generall worker, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is said to be <hi>onely wise;</hi> for a man is not
sayd to be wise, except he know all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to such a busines; If there be any part, or
corner of it hid from him, he is not wise, that is, he
is not able to proceede aright, he is subject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
but <hi>God,</hi> who hath abundance of light, <hi>God,</hi>
that knowes all things, is onely wise, and therefore
his is onely able to perswade. Hence it is that men
are able to perswade, that such graces are good,
that such wayes are excellent in themselues, that it
is good to take such courses, but yet to answer all
the secret objections of the heart, to perswade ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to turne all the wheeles of the soule, this is that,
that a man is not able to doe, to enlighten all the
corners of the heart, he is not able to convince
fully.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> is onely able to doe it; because
he onely knowes all the windings and turnings of
the heart of man.<note place="margin">God onely knowes the severall tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the heart.</note> It is sayd in <hi>Ier. 17. 9.</hi> that <hi>the
heart of man is exceeding deceit full, who can know it?</hi>
That is, no man in the world can know his owne
heart,<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 9.</note> much lesse can any man else know it, there
are so many windings, so many turnings in it,
there is such a labyrinth in the heart, such a depth
in it, that no man is able to search his owne heart,
to finde out the bottom of it: oh but who is able
to doe it? Sayth he, in the next words, it is <hi>God</hi>

               <p>We may make this vse of it:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we see the reason,
why one man is able to see and to trust to this <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why one man trusteth God, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and another is not. The reason
is, because <hi>Christ</hi> hath revealed it to one man and

A wise, learned, wittie, and able man, that can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

that is in <hi>God,</hi> yet when he comes to the practice
of it, he is able to doe nothing: On the other side,
wee shall finde in experience, that many poore
Christians, that are able to say little, yet when
they come to practice, they are able to part with

by him, &amp; therefore they are able to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
it; As for the others they are taught by men,
they are taught by themselues, and therefore they
are not taught it indeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, they are not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it, and therfore though they know such
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2062:253"/>
things, though they be floating in their mindes,
yet they haue not the vse &amp; the practice of them.
Wherein you shall obserue this difference, That a
man may know a truth, and yet not be led into
that truth,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 13.</note> as you see <hi>Ioh. 16. 13. when he shall come
which is the spirit of truth, he shall leade you into all
truth.</hi> (Marke it) <hi>he shall leade you into all truth.</hi>
It is one thing to preach the truth, and another
thing to be led into the truth. The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> shall
lead you into all truth, as a man is led by the hand
into a place: for we are not onely blind, but lame
too; wee are not onely vnable to see spirituall
truthes, but when we see them, we are not able to
follow the guidance of the <hi>holy Ghost;</hi> Therefore
sayth he, the spirit shall not onely shew you such
and such things, but shall leade you into those
truthes, he shall leade you into the practice of
them. Many men they know what temperance,
what sobrietie, and patience are, who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to practice them, that are not led into the truth
of these poynts: because that is proper to the <hi>holy
Ghost,</hi> it is he onely that leades vs into them; it is
he onely that enableth vs so to see them, as to be
fully convinced, so, as to resolue vpon the practice
of them; and therefore you shall finde the Apostle
<hi>S. Paul, Ephes. 1.</hi> when he revealeth there those
spirituall blessings, that we haue in Christ, when
he had declared many of those glorious priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
in the 18. verse he prayes,<note place="margin">Ephes 1. 18.</note> that <hi>the eyes of their
vnderstandings might be opened, to see the hope of
their Calling, and the riches of this glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
prepared for the Saints, &amp; the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2062:254"/>
of his power towardes them that beleeue.</hi> The
meaning of it is this; when <hi>Paul</hi> had discovered
all this, sayth he, this labour of mine will be but in
vaine, except the <hi>Lord</hi> open the eyes of your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
So it is when we preach to you, of
the <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> when wee discover to
you those glorious priviledges, that we haue by
<hi>Christ,</hi> except the <hi>Lord</hi> open mens eyes, except
he send the spirit of revelation into mens hearts
to discerne those things, except he preach to the
heart, as well as we doe to the eare, it is but lost la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
sayth the Apostle, if <hi>he would open your eyes
to see the hope of your Calling,</hi> to see those great
hopes that you haue by reason of your Calling,
to see the riches of that glorious inheritance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Saints, it is not onely rich, but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
riches. Againe, (sayth he,) to see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
greatnesse of his power: A man is able to
see some thing, that <hi>God</hi> is able to doe this, and to
doe that; but to see the exceeding greatnesse of
his power, how farre it reacheth, this none is able
to doe, vnlesse he haue the spirit of revelation, to
open his eyes to see it; That, even as <hi>Elisha</hi> sayd

                     </gap>, there are more with vs them against vs.</hi>
But how came <hi>Gehasie</hi> to know that? <hi>Elisba</hi> prayes
the <hi>Lord</hi> to open his eyes, and when his eyes were
opened, he saw it visibly: after this manner, the
<hi>Lord</hi> deales with his children; when such truths as
these are propounded to them, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
yet all this is nothing, except <hi>God</hi> will open
their eyes, except he will be with them; as he was
with <hi>Iob,</hi> all that his friends said to him would not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2062:254"/>
perswade him, till <hi>God</hi> himselfe spake to him out
of the whirlewinde. When <hi>God</hi> himselfe will say
to a man as he did to <hi>Abraham, I am All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
then he perswades him, and not before. And
this, <hi>Beloved,</hi> is the office of the <hi>holy Ghost;</hi> it is he
that <hi>shewes the Father, and the Sonne,</hi> to the sonnes
of men, it is he that glorifies the Father, and the
Sonne. And in this sence he is said to fill them
with Ioy vpon all occasions: for the cause why a
man rejoyceth is, because he is informed of some
good newes, something he is perswaded of, and
when he heareth of it, there followes sudden Ioy;
So when the Apostles were in distres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, in prison,
when they were in danger, the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> brought
good newes to them, he revealed to them such
and such things; vpon this revelation, vpon this
good newes that was brought to them, it is oft
said they were filled with Ioy; which is therefore
called <hi>the Ioy of the holy Ghost,</hi> which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>
workes in men by perswasion, by revealing to
them <hi>the hope of their Calling, and the riches of their
glorious inheritance, and the exceeding greatnesse of
his power, working in those that beleeue.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this you must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that though we preach
to you, and you heare all these truths of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi>
yet you are able to practice nothing,
till <hi>Christ</hi> reveale it to you. If he come to a man
when he is in a strait, and say to him, as he did to
<hi>Paul</hi> vpon severall occasions, <hi>feare not Paul, I will
be with thee.</hi> I say, if he himselfe would come thus
and speake to the heart of a man, that is, if he
would reveale it by his spirit, wee should be able
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2062:255"/>
to practice it, we should be able to stay our selues
vpon him, wee should be able to trust him in his
<hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi> and would venture vpon any
thing, we should be able to doe our dutie, wee
should be able to suffer persecution, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

speakes, <hi>because we trust in the living God.</hi> It is
a certaine and true rule, no man is able to guide
his life aright, his riches, his credit, his libertie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
except he be able to neglect them; and no
man is able to neglect them, except he haue some
thing that is better in stead of them; except he see
these two things.</p>
               <p>An emptinesse in them.</p>
               <p>And a fulnesse some where els.</p>
               <p>But now who is able to perswade men of this?
Surely he that perswaded <hi>Salomon</hi> that all was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
it is he that must perswade vs; without him
it cannot be done. What was the reason else that
<hi>Peter, Andrew, Iohn,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles,
were able to forsake all things, when others were
not? Doubtlesle, because they were per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>waded
they should finde it againe in <hi>Christ,</hi> when others
were not so perswaded; flesh and bloud did not
teach them, but the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> revealed it to them,
that though they had lost all, yet they should find
all, yea, they should finde an hundred fold more.
What was the Reason that <hi>Demas,</hi> and others,
when they met with persecution, and temporall
preferments in the world, were not able to keepe
on their course, but turned aside, when <hi>Paul</hi> who
had the same temtations did not? The reason
was, because it was not revealed to <hi>Demas,</hi> but it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2062:255"/>
was to <hi>Paul;</hi> A window was opened to him in
heaven, as it were, to looke into <hi>Gods All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,</hi>
to see the treasures there, to see <hi>Gods</hi> power,
and eternitie, and blessednes; and when he walked
in a continuall sight of this <hi>All-sufficiencie, Paul</hi>
cared not whither he went, nor what became of
him; it was nothing then for him ot passe from
prison to prison, from affliction to affliction.
So, as long as a man walkes in a continuall sight
of <hi>Gods All-sufficiencie,</hi> as long as <hi>he sees him that
is invisible,</hi>
so long he is full of comfort, so long he
is able to doe any thing; but when once his sight
is taken from him, when once he is left in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that Torches and Candles begin to appeare
great lights vnto him, (as you know it is in the
darke night,) that is a signe that a man is in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
when the feare of men, and the favour of
men, seeme great vnto him: So it will be when
<hi>God</hi> doth but leaue vs a little, when he doth but
cloud vs, when he withdrawes from vs that light
of his <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi> then we are readie to sinke,
and to fayle in our dutie, and to turne aside, to
balke the wayes of righteousnesse. And therefore
if you would haue the vse of this <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi>
if you would be perswaded that all things are in
<hi>Gods</hi> hands, beseech him to teach you to depend
vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is certaine, that the holiest man that
is, hath as much loue of himselfe as others, they
desire their safetie, as well as others, they desire to
haue libertie, and life, as well as others: but here
is all the difference, they are perswaded that <hi>God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2062:256"/>
is All-sufficient,</hi> to restore all these to them, when
they loose them for his sake, when other men are
not so perswaded: they haue a new judgement of
things, they haue another judgement of heavenly
things, and of earthly, they see another vanitie in
the Creatures, and another <hi>All-sufficiencie in God,</hi>
then other men see, or then they themselues ever
saw before; And this is the reason they are able to
doe that which other men are not able to doe;
and therefore, the way to haue the vse of all this
knowledge, is to seeke to <hi>God,</hi> to beseech him to
enlighten you, that he would declare this to you,
that he would leade you into this truth; and when
he hath taught you, you shall be able to know all
this, and to know it to purpose. So much for this
first poynt.</p>
               <p>As we told you, there are here these two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions:</p>
               <p>First; That <hi>the iust, and the wise, and their workes
are in the hands of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And secondly; That <hi>all things come alike to all:</hi>
we will take the first as it lyes, and deliver to you
the same poynt, which is this;</p>
               <p>That all things, all men, all their wayes, all the
Creatures, with the severall workes of them, are
in the hands of <hi>God:</hi> for it is thus methodically
set downe; The wise are in the hands of <hi>God,</hi> and
their workes, and so are the wicked, and their
workes, and so are all the Creatures in his hands,
with all the effects that proceede from them.</p>
               <p>This then is the poynt;<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note>
                  <q>That <hi>all things are in</hi> Gods <hi>hands.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">All things are in Gods hands.</note>
                  </q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:2062:256"/>Now how all things are in <hi>Gods</hi> hands in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
we haue declared to you before: but we will
now deliver it a little more distinctly, that I may
adde some thing to that, which I haue formerly
taught. They are all in the hands of <hi>God,</hi> that is, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
in the hands of the Father, and in the
hands of all the persons of the Trinitie, as they
joyne in the deitie, as they are <hi>God:</hi> but yet, if you
compare this place with some other, you shall see
more distinctly in what manner they are in the
hands of <hi>God:</hi> They are, I say, originally in the
hands of the Father; but yet they are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
put into the hands of the Sonne, as he is
Mediator. Therefore compare this place with
<hi>Math.</hi> 11. 27.<note place="margin">Math. 11. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>All things</hi> (sayth he) <hi>are given me

there this expression; sayth the Apostle, <hi>there shall
be an end, when Christ shall giue vp the King dome

this, that though all things be in the hands of <hi>God,</hi>
yet they are all put into the hands of <hi>Christ,</hi> as he

and the vtmost parts of the earth for thy pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:</hi>
That is, he will giue them into his hands
to doe with them what he pleaseth; So that (to
adde this to that which we haue before delivered)
it will be a profitable poynt for vs to consider, that
though <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and hath all things
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2062:257"/>
in his hands, yet he hath put all this into the hands
of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>You willsay,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> what comfort is there in that? or
to what end is it vsefull for vs to know, that they
are in the hands of the sonne, more then that they

               <p>It is to this purpose;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> That you may be more

that, as wee haue neede and vse of any thing, it
shall not be denied vs: for we know all is in the

               <p>When one heareth that his Prince hath put

it, That the Father hath put all things into the

that we should take heede of comming to <hi>God</hi>

in so doing, but dishonour the Sonne? We giue
him not that honor which his Father would haue

with boldnes to partake of his <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi>

               <p>The reason why great things are not done for
vs, notwithstanding <hi>God is All-sufficient,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we come not with great faith; If we were

him, and come in his name, we would come with
a strong faith, and if we did so, it would be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our faith. When we come timorously and
fearefully to <hi>God,</hi> when we come doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we shall receiue it or no, it is a signe we come
in our owne name; When we come boldly and
confidently, and make no question, but the thing
we aske shall be granted, it is a signe that we come
in the name of <hi>Christ;</hi> and if we doe so, doe you
thinke he will deny vs? My <hi>Beloved,</hi> to what end
hath the Father given him all things into his
hands? Why is he made rich with all treasures?
Is it that he might keepe it, and hoard it vp? No,
but it is to bestowe on those that his Father hath
given him amongst men; when a man hath riches
<hi>it is a vanitie vnder the Sunne,</hi> sayth <hi>Salomon,</hi> to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2062:259"/>
keepe them, and hoard them vp; he were as good
not to haue them, as not to vse them; and doe
you thinke that <hi>Christ</hi> will haue all things given
into his hands for nothing? Is it not to bestow on
vs? Doe you thinke, that he will purchase a thing
at so deare a rate, and when he hath done, make

this for himselfe, for his owne sake? Certainely, it
was not for himselfe, for he had no neede of it,
but he bought it for vs; and will he not make vse
of it, when he hath done? therefore doubt not
when you come in his name, you shall receiue,
and that abundantly too; when wee come in the

onely remember this, that thou come with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
It is said,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 12.</note>

that you are in Covenant with him, that you

receiue any thing, let him haue the sacrifice of
prayse, let it adde some new loue, and some new

The Father hath done it for that purpose, that the
Sonne might be honoured, that the Sonne might
be magnified, that wee might learne to loue the
Sonne, to serue the Sonne, as we doe the Father;
and therefore whensoever we obtaine any thing
at his hands, let vs be thankfull to the Sonne; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

               <p>Now we come to the next Conclusion, <hi>All
things come alike to all; The same condition is to the
iust, as to the wicked, and to the good and pure, and
to the polluted, to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
sacrificeth not; such as the good is, so is the sinner, he
that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Hence I

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:2062:260"/>That <hi>All men are divided into these two rankes,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">All men divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Rankes.</note> 
                  <hi>either they are polluted or

not:</hi> There is no middle sort of men in the

within the Covenant, or without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
all are either elect, or reprobates; <hi>God</hi> hath
divided all the world into these two, either they
are the <hi>Lords</hi> portion, or the <hi>Devils</hi> portion.</p>
               <p>There are some Reasons of it.</p>
               <p>One is;<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> That <hi>God</hi> hath made all men to be <hi>ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels

               <p>Againe;<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> Who are they that divide the world?
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Sathan:</hi> Either you belong to <hi>God,</hi> and

                  <hi>His people are his

               <p>And so likewise may we reason from the two
principles,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> either a man is <hi>borne of the flesh, or of the
spirit;</hi> if he be borne of the spirit, he is spirituall,
and if he be borne of the flesh, he is fleshly. And
therefore in one of these two conditions hee must
needes be; which I obserue for this purpose.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> you see hence then, that there are but two
places hereafter for men, as there are but two
rankes of men; there is no middle place, as the
<hi>Papists</hi> affirme, there is no <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> or <hi>Limbus,</hi>
either for the Fathers before <hi>Christ,</hi> or for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

are but two places into which all men are divided,

               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:2062:261"/>But secondly;<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> The chiefest vse that wee are to
make of it is this; If it be so, if a mans condition
must be one of these two, that either he is within
the dore in the Kingdome of <hi>God,</hi> or without, that
though some are come neere the Kingdome of
<hi>God,</hi> some are farther off among those that are
without. And againe, among those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the doore, some are farther in, some are not so
farre, some haue proceeded farther into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
some a lesse way, yet there are none in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
way, but all are either within, or without, let
vs then learne to consider, what our condition is,
let not our perswasion and opinion of our selues,
hang betweene both, but let vs come to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
to this disiunctiue proposition, Either I
am in the number of those that are good, or that
are bad; either I am within the Covenant or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
and so consider in which of these two condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we are: Men are exceeding apt in this case
to deceiue themselues; and therefore when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
hath occasion to speake of this, he premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that still, <hi>Be not deceived, such and such shall not
inherit the Kingdome of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 6.</note> and so in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 6.
<hi>Let no man deceiue you with vaine words; for, for
such things comes the wrath of God vpon the children
of disobedience:</hi> That is, men are exceeding apt to
deceiue themselues; to be pure in their owne eyes,
when they are not yet clensed from their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to thinke their estate good, when it is not;
and therefore, beware, take heede that it be not so
with you. What a miserable condition is it, that
when a man hath beene at the paines to set vp a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2062:261"/>
large building, he should then loose all his labour
for want of a good foundation? that a man should
do as the foolish Virgins, get oyle in their Lamps,
and make a great blaze for a time, and when they
come to the very poynt, to the dore, to the gate,
then to be excluded: Nay, what a folly is it for a
man to deceiue himselfe in this. It may be, a man
out of the corruption of his nature, may be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to deceiue another; but for a man to deceiue
himselfe, it is exceeding great folly. And truely,
as it is said of flattery, none can be flattered by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
till first he flatter himselfe; So no man can
be deceived by another, till first he be willing to
deceiue himselfe. Therefore take heede of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
your selues.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ankes of men
thou art? Consider then whether thou be a <hi>good</hi>

Goodnesse consists in these foure things.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First;<note place="margin">Goodnesse which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in foure things.</note> 
                  <hi>The tree must be good,</hi> as you haue it in
<hi>Math. 7. 16. 17.</hi> that is, a man then is said to be a
good man, when there is a good sap in him, when
there is some thing in him that is good, when
there are some supernaturall graces wrought in
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16. 17.</note> he that is not emptie of these, he is a good
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man: as it is said of <hi>Barnabas, he was a good man;</hi>
and how was that proved? <hi>he was full of faith, and
the holy Ghost.</hi> See then whether thou hast an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
heart or no. You say a thing is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
when it is emptie of that excellencie, that
should be in it; when Wine hath not that in it,
that belongs to wine, you say it is naught; and
so we say of all things else; When a man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath not that in him that belongs to a man,
that is, to a man, as he was created in innocency,
he is wicked and naught, a sonne of <hi>Beliall:</hi> but
when he hath a blessing in him, as grapes haue
wine in them, when he hath supernaturall grace
wrought in his heart, when he hath the new <hi>Adam</hi>
putting into his heart, the sap of grace &amp; life, then
he is good. Therefore see whether there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2062:262"/>
put into thee, more then is in thee by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
see whether thou finde the new <hi>Adam</hi> effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate new sap to thee, new grace,
and new light to thee, as the old <hi>Adam</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
corruption; See whether thou be made
a good tree or no: for it is the tree, that makes the
fruit good, and not the fruit, that makes the tree
good; So it is the man, that justifieth his worke,
and not the worke, that justifieth the man: and
therefore thou must first see, whether thou be in
the Covenant, whether thou hast this seale, that
thou seest some thing put into thee, which thou
hast not by nature. Every man by nature is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
when grace is put into him, then he is said to
be good. As it is good wine, when it is full of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
when it hath that in it, that belongs to wine;
So he is a good man, that hath that in him, which
belongs to him in his regenerate estate.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Consider whether thou <hi>bring forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
good fruit,</hi> that is, not onely whether thou doest
good actions, but whether they flow from thee,
whether they grow in thine heart as naturally, as
fruit growes on the tree, that flowes from the sap
within. When a man not onely doth good works,
but when he is zealous of them, <hi>it is his meate and
drinke to doe them,</hi> when they flow from him, as
water from the fountaine, then he is a good man:
for if the tree be good, that is, if the heart be good,
a man will be as readie, and will as naturally bring
forth good fruit, as the tree, the Vine, or the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
bring forth their fruit.</p>
               <p>The third thing you shall see in the 2 <hi>Tim. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 21.</note>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:2062:263"/>
vessels are said to be good, to be vessels of honour;
when they are <hi>prepared to every good worke;</hi> So
when a man is good, and brings forth good fruit,
and not onely brings it forth, but if there be any
occasions to put forth the goodnesse, that is in
him, he is parepared for it, as a vessell is prepared
for such a turne, for such a service. The word in
the originall signifieth, when a man is fashioned,
as a vessell is fashioned: and the meaning of the
<hi>holy Ghost</hi> is therefore to shew, that then a man is
good, when his heart is fitted to good workes,
when he knowes how to goe about them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
another bungles at them, and knowes not how
to doe them, he is prepared for them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there needs no more, but to put him and the
good worke together, and he is readie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The last is;<note place="margin">Act. 10. 38.</note> When there is not onely a readines,
but practice vpon all occasions, when a man <hi>doth
good,</hi> as it is sayd, that <hi>Iesus Christ went about doing
good.</hi> And therefore he is a good man that is a vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man, such a man that every one fares the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for, such a man as is serviceable to <hi>God</hi> &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to men. Before regeneration when a man
is a stranger to this goodnesse, he onely serues
himselfe, he is full of selfe-loue, all his ends are to
looke to himselfe, that he may be kept safe; he
cares not what becomes of any thing els, so it be
well with him; but when once goodnesse comes
into his heart, it hath this fruit, he goes about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good; because grace brings that principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heart, that never grew there before, that it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2062:263"/>
the loue of <hi>God</hi> and man; whereas before there
was nothing but selfe-loue in him, which plant
growes naturally in the garden of nature, when
grace comes, it brings loue with it, and that loue
makes vs vsefull, and serviceable both to <hi>God</hi> and
man, So that whatsoever a man hath, what gifts,
what knowledge, what authoritie he hath, he is
readie to vse it for the good of others. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
saith of <hi>One simus</hi> in the Epistle to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
Now he is profitable to thee and mee, whereas
before he was vnprofitable:</hi> So it may be said of all

and that is this;</p>
               <p>Consider whether thou bee
cleane and pure in heart, or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted;
<hi>There is the same condition
to the pure, and to the polluted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now what it is to be cleane,<note place="margin">Difference. 1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> or to be washed,
you shall see 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. And such were some of you:</hi>
That is, you were polluted with those sins, there
named, <hi>but now</hi> (sayth he) <hi>you are washed.</hi> And
wherein stands this washing? He tels vs it stands
in these two things: <hi>Now you are iustified; now you
are sanctified. You are iustified through the name of
Christ; and sanctified through the spirit of our God.</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2062:264"/>
So then, he is a pure man, or a cleane man, that is
first washed from the guilt of his sinnes, that is,
that hath no sinne lying vpon his Conscience,
that hath not a polluted Conscience, which is a
phrase vsed <hi>Titus 1.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Titus 1.</note> 
                  <hi>whose mindes and consciences
are defiled.</hi> Now defilement, or pollution is in the
Conscience, as Divines say, as a thing that is
knowne is in the facultie, or vnderstanding that
knowes it; and therefore the man that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any sinne, which yet continues vpon his
owne score, which his Conscience is yet guiltie
of, &amp; for which he hath not yet gotten an acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from Almightie <hi>God,</hi> he is an impure man,
he is yet vncleane; for <hi>he is not yet washed from his
filthinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man againe that hath gotten any assurance
of forgiuenesse, so that all his sinnes are put vpon
the reckoning of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and there are none
that lye vpon his owne score, a man who hath
made all his reckonings even with <hi>God,</hi> and hath
some assurance therof such a man is washed from
his filthinesse. Such a phrase you haue likewise in
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 25.<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>I will cleanse you</hi> (or wash you) <hi>from
all your Idols:</hi> That is, from all your Idolatrie, from
all the sinnes that you haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, I will wash
you, that is, with imputation, or sprinkling of the
bloud of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second cleannesse, is, when a man is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
onely washed with the imputation of the bloud
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the assurance of pardon, but also
when he is washed from the staine of sinne, when
he is sanctified through the spirit, when sinne is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2062:265"/>
mortified in him, when it is as well healed, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.
And therefore if thou wouldest know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art a cleane man or polluted, consider
also this, whether thou hast a cleane heart or no,
that is, whether thou hast such an habituall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of puritie and cleannesse, that thou canst
not indure to looke vpon any sinne, no more then
a man, that is of a neate and cleane disposition,
can indure to see filthines, whether thou hast such
a disposition, as that although thou be sprinkled
with sinne from day to day, though thou be fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and spotted with it, yet thou sufferest it not to
abide in thy heart; thy heart workes it out, as we
sayd to you before.</p>
               <p>So that this you are to obserue, to finde out the
cleannesse of a mans disposition, whether he can
looke vpon sinne, as an vncleane thing, as a thing
from which his soule hath an aversion, as a thing
that he abhorres, that is, although there be some
thing in him, that loues it, that delights in it, that
likes it, yet the prevailing part of the soule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres
it. Both the cleane and polluted may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
sinne, and may turne away from sinne, and
therfore in that the difference is not seene, but the
difference is in this, that thou art able to hate and
abhorre sinne, to looke on it as a thing that is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and vncleane.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A Marchant, you know, will
cast out his goods, when he is in danger of his life,
but he hates not his goods; So a man may cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
sinne, when it puts him in danger of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inking
into hell, or of the judgements of men. It is one
thing to part with sinne, and another thing to hate
sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:2062:265"/>A man may withdraw himselfe from sinne,<note place="margin">It is not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sinne that sheweth puritie.</note> he
may giue it over, he may seeme to be divorced
from it, and yet he may haue a monthes mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, he may doe with it still, as the husband of
<hi>Michall,</hi> when shee was taken from him, yet,
sayth the Text, <hi>he came weeping after her a far off,</hi>
he longed after her still, and loved her still; So a
man may part with his sinne after such a manner,
that still he goes weeping after it, he would haue
it againe, he would faine inioy it, if it were not
for some greater danger, or some greater trouble
that he exposeth himselfe vnto; as you see in <hi>Phal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel,</hi>
it was not for want of loue to his wife, that
he parted with her, but it was out of a desire he had
to saue himselfe, to escape the danger of the Kings
wrath, imprisonment, and death, that would haue
followed vpon it. Therefore consider what hatred
you haue of sinne, and by that you must judge
whether you haue a cleane disposition or no.
You must not thinke any man is perfectly cleane,
and pure, but he is a cleane man, that suffers not
any impuritie to take quiet possession of his heart,
although he haue vncleane thoughts and vncleane
affections (as all sinfull thoughts and affections
are) though sinne may passe through his heart, as
they passed through the Temple, yet he suffereth
it not to set vp Tables in the Temple, to set vp an
Idoll in his heart, he suffereth it not to make any
breach of Covenant with <hi>God,</hi> to be adulterous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; though there may be many glances,
some adulterous and vncleane actions, that is
not the thing that breakes the Covenant, when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2062:266"/>
the heart is still wedded to <hi>God,</hi> and chooseth <hi>God,</hi>
and no other. And therefore, I say, in that it is not
seene, but consider what thy disposition is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou hate that sinne all the while. A man that
is of an impure spirit, of an impure heart, when he
is with impure company, when he delights him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with impure thoughts, then he is where he
would be, he is then in his owne element, and
when he is otherwise, he is where he would not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
On the other side, he that hath an habituall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of purenesse and cleannesse, though he may
be transported to those acts of sinne and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet his heart hates it, he is not where he would
be all the while, he is not vpon his owne center,
his heart still fights against it, and resists it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider with thy selfe, what thy heart is in
this case, whether thou haue a heart that hates vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,
or whether thou hast yet a swinish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that thou lyest in the mud, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to lye in it.</p>
               <p>A man may fall into the mud, but he delighteth
not to be there; no more will a cleane disposition
delight in sinne. And you may know it by this
effect, where the disposition is vncleane, there
sinne abides, till it staine the heart, till it make a
man <hi>spotted of the world,</hi> that is, it causeth him to
keepe a tract in sinne, that a man may say, this is
the path he walketh in, it causeth him to weare the
livery of sinne, that he may be knowne by it from
day to day, it causeth the spot so to sinke into the
soule, that a man may see he is such a man. This is
to haue an vncleane disposition, when vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2062:266"/>
so cleaues to his soule, that they agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
whereas in a man that hath a pure dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is not so; as,<note place="margin">1 Ioh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

is againe,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 3.</note> a <hi>liuely hope,</hi> spoken of in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. that
sets a man on worke to clense himselfe; that is,
when a man hath a true hope, a reall hope to haue
that vndefiled inheritance, he considers this with
himselfe, that an impure heart, and an vndefiled
inheritance will not stand together, and because
he hopes for it in good earnest, (it is not a false
hope, it is not a dead hope) therefore he sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
on worke indeede to purifie himselfe; <hi>he that
hath that hope purifieth himselfe,</hi> he cleanseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Who ever therefore doth not purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
it is an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that his hope is dead which
he hath of being saved, it is but the hope of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite;
a hope that will stand him in no steede;
for it brings forth no endevour: that is the second
thing. I must be briefe in this, because this is not
the poynt I intend, but that which followes.</p>
               <p>The third expression here vsed,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> is, <hi>he that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and he that sacrificeth not.</hi> This is but a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche,</hi>
where one particular is put for all other
kindes of holy duties; But the meaning is this;
you shall know a man by this, in which of the two

<hi>God,</hi> he dares not omit any holy ordinance, he
dares not omit any sacrifice, he dares not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2062:267"/>
forme them in a slight and negligent manner.
He againe whose heart is false, sacrificeth not, that
is, either he omits the dutie, or else he omits the
substance and life of the dutie. You know in <hi>Iam.

he that keepes them, he that observeth
them, but yet fayles in one, it is argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough,
that he makes not Conscience of any. You shall
finde this true, that whosoever he is, that sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
not, that is, he that prayes not constantly,
he that heares not, he that reades not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
he that sanctifieth not <hi>Gods</hi> Sabbaths, he that
partaketh not of the Sacraments, &amp;c. he that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

it is an vsuall case, (nothing more vsuall in the

they be children, because they cannot put a

the Consciences of men, with these bare formes

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The last expression is, <hi>He that sweareth, and he
that feareth an oath.</hi> That which is said of this sinne,<note place="margin">Difference.</note>
may be applyed likwise to all others, and so here
is a fourth difference betwixt the good and bad.
A man who is within the Covenant, hath this
propertie, that he feares sinne, and dares not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with it, that is, he will not neglect looking to
his heart, he will not be negligent in keeping a
Watch over his heart, and over his wayes, but
hath a continuall eye vpon sinne, as we say <hi>Timor

sure to haue a continuall eye vnto it.</p>
               <p>If a man be about a busines, and there be any
thing that he feares, he will neglect his worke to
haue an eye vpon that, whatsoever it be. If a man
feare sinne, he will be very diligent in watching
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2062:269"/>
himselfe, in taking heede that sinne come not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by the by, with some by-blow, that he
looked not for; such a man hath a continuall eye
vpon sinne, he is exceeding diligent in looking to
his heart and wayes; when another man neglects
it, and therefore easily slips into sinne, now into
an oath, now into Sabbath-breaking, sometimes
to the omission of prayer, sometimes to the lust
of vncleann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse, sometimes to lying and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
sometimes to one sinne, sometimes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and the reason is, because he is negligent.
The <hi>foolish goes on and is carelesse,</hi> that is, he feares
not sinne, and therefore he neglects, having an eye
to sinne.</p>
               <p>Now that you may finde out more distinctly,
what this <hi>feare</hi> is, consider this, he that feares, he
doth not onely feare the sinne it selfe, but he feares
any thing that he hath a suspition of, he feares any
thing that is doubtfull; if it be such a thing, as may
be evill to him, he feares it; So, a man that feares
sinne, though it be not cleare to him, though he
be not fully convinced that such or such a thing
is a sinne, yet if he be one that feares sinne, he
will not meddle with it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Put the case he doubt
whether the Sabbath should be so strictly kept,
notwithstanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because he is doubtfull of it, he
will not meddle with it. Put the case, he doubt
whether gaming is to be vsed, if he feares, he dares
not meddle with it. As if there should be intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given to a man, that such a cup or such a dish
were poysoned, he would not meddle with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he feareth it, he feareth death, he feareth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2062:270"/>
sicknesse, so a man that feareth sinne, if there be
but a su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pition of it, though others swallow it
without making any bones of it, yet he dares not;
and therefore consider what thou doest in that
case.</p>
               <p>Besides, when a man feares, he not onely feares
the thing, but that which may make way to it: for
feare, you know, sets the heart to prevent evill to
come; the object of it, 18, <hi>Malum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uturum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the object of griefe, is present evill; so it is also
with those that feare sinne. Put the case, sinne be
farre off from a man, yet if he feare it, he will not
come neere the occasions, that might leade him
to it,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 10.</note> but keepes himselfe farre from it (as in <hi>Exod.</hi>
we are commanded, <hi>keepe thy selfe farre from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
matter,</hi>) he dares not suffer his thoughts to
wander, he dares no gaze vpon vnlawfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
he dares not come into company with them,
that will infect him, he dares not come neare the
traine, though he be farre off the blow. Thus a man
is affected that feares. And hence it is that when
a man is possessed with a disposition of feare, he
doth not onely feare for a fit, but if it be a thing
that he naturally feares, it is a constant feare, he
feares it at all times.</p>
               <p>You shall finde evill men may feare by fits. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
feared, when <hi>Eliah</hi> brought a terrible message

                     </gap>oh</hi>
feared, when <hi>Moses</hi> brought vpon him those
heavie iudgements, and plagues; but these feares
of theirs were as mists, which cleared vp againe,

the sinceritie of our feare, that we doe not feare by

               <p>The ground of it is this; such a man feares one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  </gap> onely the evill, and
therefore when that is taken away, he feares no
more; but with the godly man it is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<hi>he feares the Lord and his goodnesse,</hi>

and therefore when there is an end of evill and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,

when goodnesse comes in the roome of it, when

his feare doth not cease, (as the feare of <hi>Ahab</hi>
did,) but he feares <hi>God</hi> still, yea he feares him now
more then ever. The more <hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
towards him, the more he feares; because
the more his loue is increased, the more his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of Conscience is increased, the more
sweetnesse he findes in <hi>God,</hi> and therefore the more
he is afraid to loose it, the more he is afraid of any

finde in those that feare.</p>
               <p>Againe; You shall finde a difference in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

                  </gap>st bold in all things else.
And on the contrary; he that feares other things
most, he feareth sinne least; and the reason of this
is, because a godly man lookes vpon sinne, as the
maine; he knows that toucheth him in the maine,
it toucheth him in his freehold, and therefore, if
he be to vndergoe povertie, disgrace, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if it be death, any of these things, he feares
them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for, sayth he, thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are lesse evils, these
touch me not in the maine,) but if it be sinne, he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2062:271"/>
lookes on that, as the greatest evill, and therefore
feares it aboue all things.</p>
               <p>So now by this, thou shalt know what thy feare
is, whether thou feare the doing of evill, or the
suffering of evill.</p>
               <p>Last of all, consider whether thou feare the word
of <hi>God,</hi> when there is nothing but the meere word,
when there is nothing but meere threatnings;<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 2.</note> as
in <hi>Isa. 66. 2. I will looke to them that tremble at my
Word.</hi> If thou feare onely the actuall affliction,
the judgement, the crosse, when it pincheth thee,
and is vpon thee, any naturall man is able to doe
that; but the wise man sees it before, he beleeues
the threatning, he sees it in the cloud, before it be
shed downe in the storme, he feares the word of
<hi>God,</hi> and trembles at it, because he beleeueth it,
when others beleeue it not. Therefore consider by
this, whether thou be such a one as feares sinne,
whether thou hast all these properties of true
feare, or whether on the other side, thou art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of sinne, whether thou be <hi>one that sweares,</hi> or
one that <hi>feares an oath.</hi> So much shall serue for this
poynt; <hi>All things come alike to all; and the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the iust as to the wicked, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next poynt, that we haue to obserue out of
these words, is this;<note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For the time of this life, there
are the like events to good men, as to the wicked:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Things fall out alike to good and bad in this life.</note>
That is, though <hi>God</hi> be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> though he
make good his <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi> to the Saints, so
that <hi>he is a Sunne and a Shield vnto them, and no
good thing is wanting to them,</hi> nor any evill thing
can come neere them, yet for all this, for the time
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2062:272"/>
of this life, in this world, there are the like events
to both, he deales with the one, as with the other.
This is his common course, as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it both here, and in other places. In the
11. verse of this Chapter, I obserue, sayth he, and
I see, that <hi>the Race is not alwayes to the swi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is weake gets the battaile, &amp; he that is more
vnwise gets favour, &amp;c. So, he that deserues the
best, misseth it, and he that deserues the worst,
obtaines it. So, likewise in the 8. Chapter, you
shall see this fully, if you compare that and the
latter end of this ninth Chapter together;<note place="margin">Chap. 8. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>There is,</hi>
sayth he, a man <hi>that rules to his owne hurt,</hi> and to
the hurt of others; yet, sayth he, this man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in it, yea, he continues in it in peace, even to
his graue, and not so onely, but when he is gone,
and is <hi>come from the holy place,</hi> that is, the place of
Magistracie, (that is there called the holy place,)
<hi>it is all forgotten;</hi> though he had done evill, yet he
continued in peace, and died in peace, and after
also there was no blemish cast vpon him, but it is
forgotten; this I haue seene, sayth <hi>Salomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, you shall finde it as true on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side; <hi>I haue seene,</hi> sayth he, <hi>a poore man that was
wise, that hath delivered a Cittie, when a great King
had made forts against it:</hi> That is, though he were
a poore man, yet through his wisedome, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it from a great King; <hi>but,</hi> sayth he, <hi>this also
was forgotten;</hi> The poore man was forgotten, and
so the good ruler was forgotten, and the evill ruler
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2062:272"/>
was forgotten. And as it is said of the ruler, so it
is said of the errour which comes from the face
of the ruler; <hi>I haue seene,</hi> sayth <hi>Salomon, a vanitie
vnder the Sunne, that ariseth from the face of the
ruler,</hi> that is, from the errour of the Ruler. What
is that? <hi>Folly is set in great excellencie, and the rich
set in low place. I haue seene servants on horse backe,
and Princes walking as servants on the ground,</hi>
Chap. 10. 6. 7. That is,<note place="margin">Chap. 10. 6. 7.</note> those that were holy and
good, they were rich, how poore soever they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be, they were wise, howsoever the world
accounted of them, they were Princes, though
the world reckoned them as servants: And on the
other side, those that were evill, they were poore,
though they appeared to be never so rich, they
were base, though they seemed to be never so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they were foolish, though they seemed to
haue the repute of wisedome. Now, sayth he, I
haue seene these servants on horse-backe, sitting
in great excellencie, when others, though they
were Princes, haue beene set in low places, and
haue walked like servants on foote. Thus you see,
that <hi>all things come alike to all,</hi> so the <hi>Lord</hi> dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it; If you looke to the condition of things,
you shall see, that all bastards escape not afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and againe, that many sonnes haue but little
affliction.</p>
               <p>You shall see againe, that not all evill men haue
prosperitie, nor all good men are followed with
adversitie; but <hi>God</hi> disposeth these things promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously.</p>
               <p>You shall see <hi>Iosiah,</hi> a good King,<note place="margin">Instances.</note> slaine with an

Arrow, when he changed his cloths, and covered
himselfe, and dissembled his person, even as well
as <hi>Ahab</hi> was.</p>
               <p>You shall see no difference in the case, as it is
decribed 2 <hi>Chron. 35.</hi> the same condition fell to<note place="margin">2 Chro. 35. 23</note>
them both, they both disguised themselues, the
Archers both shot at random, <hi>God</hi> directed the
Arrowes to both of them, both were sicke and
wounded in their Chariots, both were carried
out of the battaile, yet the one a very good King,
and the other a wicked King.</p>
               <p>You see againe <hi>Ioseph</hi> was put in Prison for his
innocencie, as well as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler and Baker
were for their offences.</p>
               <p>You see <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were excluded out of

               <p>And so likewise in the manner of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
there are punishments of divers sorts, some
are more secret punishments, some are more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
some are taken out for examples, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may feare; others he lets alone, and makes
them not examples. This libertie he vseth in the
dispending of his punishments; and the like he
doth in his rewards. Some he rewards openly for
their well-doing, that others might be incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
Some men he suffers to waite a long time,
and there comes no present reward; he shall haue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2062:274"/>
it, he shall haue a reward according to his works;
but yet this libertie <hi>God</hi> vseth in the dispensation
of it.</p>
               <p>The vse we should make of it is this;<note place="margin">Vse.</note> If this be
so, then let vs not be offended, let vs not thinke,
that <hi>God</hi> is not therefore <hi>All-suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cient,</hi> because he
deales sometimes <hi>with the righteous according to
the workes of the wicked,</hi> sometimes <hi>with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
according to the workes of the righteous;</hi> for you
see, he will be <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> he will keepe the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this rule, <hi>he will reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his worke,</hi> he will make good his <hi>All-sufficiencie</hi>
in performing his promises to them,
that belong to him; and againe, he will make
good all his threatnings to those that are enemies
to him.</p>
               <p>But now for the time of his dispensation, and
administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things, it is true, he takes a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to himselfe. And to make this the clearer to
you, I will doe these two things.</p>
               <p>First, I will shew you the reasons, why <hi>God</hi> doth
thus for a time, why thus he disposeth all things
for a certaine season.</p>
               <p>And secondly, I will shew you this, that though
he doe thus for a season, yet certainely, he is <hi>All-sufficient;
To the good it shall goe well, and it shall
goe ill with the sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> I say, <hi>God</hi> doth thus for a time: And why?
One reason is;<note place="margin">To trie men.</note> That <hi>God</hi> may try the faith and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of men; for if when men haue sinned, <hi>God</hi>
should smite presently, if when they doe well, <hi>God</hi>
should reward them presently, they would be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2062:274"/>
drawne to well-doing, and from evill-doing, not
by sinceritie and by faith, but by sence. Now the
<hi>Lord</hi> therefore deferres it, he puts it off, that <hi>those
that are proved, may be knowne,</hi> that what men doe
out of sinceritie may appeare to be so, that men
may <hi>liue by faith, and not by sence,</hi> that men might
be drawne to liue by right respects, and not by
sensuall and carnall respects; as they would doe, if
either his punishments were presently, or his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> The <hi>Lord</hi> doth it to spare mankinde;
for if the LORD should punish presently,<note place="margin">Tospare men.</note> men
should perish from the earth. And therefore he
doth in this case, as Generals are wont to do with
their Souldiers, when there is a generall fault
committed, they cast lots and picke out two, or
three, and put them to death, that the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
may be saved; So the <hi>Lord</hi> doth, he takes here
and there one, whom it may be, he followes with
open and great judgements for open sinnes; But
for others againe, the generalitie, he suffers and
lets them alone, because he would spare mankind.
This reason I finde vsed,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. the <hi>Lord</hi> sayd
there, when he was about to destroy man from
the earth, <hi>My spirit shall no longer striue with man,
for he is but flesh:</hi> That is, if I should continually
deale with men, as I doe now, if I should take
them, and sweepe them away with the Besome
of destruction, as I doe these, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
no flesh vpon the earth; and therefore,
sayth he, <hi>I will not striue with them,</hi> but beare with
them patiently, though their sinnes are great and
many.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2062:275"/>
Againe;<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> the <hi>Lord</hi> doth it, that he might keepe
from vs the events of things;<note place="margin">To hide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents from men.</note> It is his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to reserue them to himselfe, and therefore he
goes not in a constant course. When men sinne,
he doth not presently punish, neither when a man
doth well, doth he presently reward him, that is,
he goes not in one tract, as it were, but sometimes
he doth the one, and sometimes the other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously;
and for this end, sayth the <hi>Wiseman,
he hath made this contrarie to that, that no man might
finde any thing after him:</hi> That is, that he might
leaue no foot-steps behinde him; (as we haue that
phrase vsed,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom. 11. 33. How vnsearchable are thy
wayes, and thy Iudgements past finding out.</hi>) The
word in the originall signifieth, that when <hi>God</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he leaues no <hi>vestigia,</hi> no print behinde him,
so that a man cannot say, he will goe this way, he
goes it not so oft, as to make a path of it; I speake
of these particular things, he doth not so dispence
good, and evill, punishment, or rewards, that a
man can say, the <hi>Lord</hi> will doe this. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this is, because future things, the event of
things, it is his good pleasure to keepe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
as he sayth <hi>Act. 1. 7. It is not for you to know
the event of things, which the Father hath kept to
himselfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1. 7.</note> and therefore he vseth this promiscuous
dispensation of punishment, and reward, that he
might hide these things from the sonnes of men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> he doth it likewise, that he may bring
forth the treasures,<note place="margin">To bring forth his treasures.</note> both of his wrath, and of his
mercie.</p>
               <p>You will say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> how shall that be done?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2062:275"/>
Sayth <hi>God,</hi> if I should presently cut off a sinner,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
and should not forbeare him, his wickednesse
should not be full; I will let the <hi>Amorites</hi> alone,
<hi>Gen. 15. 16. That the measure of their sinne might be
fulfilled:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> purposely forbeares them,
with great patience,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom. 9. 22.</hi> He leaues them,
and heapes mercies and kindnesses vpon them,
that they might continue in their sinnes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
his patience, recompensing him evill for
good, and then he drawes out the treasures of his
wrath. If he should take them suddenly and cut
them off, there might be but some of his wrath
manifested vpon the sonnes of men; but when
they runne a long course in sinning, when they
make a heape of sinne, then <hi>God</hi> drawes out the
treasures of his wrath and power; that is the very
reason vsed,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 22. and likewise <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note>
The <hi>Lord</hi> hath certaine treasures of wrath, as wee

children of <hi>Israell, he</hi> sayth, that <hi>he suffered them to
grow,</hi> (that is the meaning of that place) <hi>as a man
suffers a Vine to grow, I suffered you to bring forth
grapes,</hi> I did not trouble you, nor interrupt you;
but when you should haue had good wine in your
grapes <hi>to refresh God and man,</hi> sayth he, <hi>your wine
was as the poyson of Dragons,</hi> and as the gall of
Aspes; in steede of doing good, and being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to men, when I gaue you so much rest
and peace. The wine you brought forth was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to man, as poyson, and as the gall and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Aspes, which is the most hurtfull thing in
the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:2062:276"/>Now, sayth the <hi>Lord,</hi> all this, I haue done, that
I might lay it vp; <hi>I haue sealed it vp among my
treasures; for vengeance and recompence is mine:</hi>
That is, therefore I haue suffered all this, that I
might draw forth all my treasures of wrath, which
otherwise would be hidden, and never opened
and manifested to the world.</p>
               <p>The like he doth to the godly; he suffers them
to goe on, he suffers them to doe well, and yet for
all this hee giues them no present reward, but
leaues them to the malice of men, to the hand of
the enemy, and suffers them to prevaile against
them, he suffers them to be in povertie, in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
in prison, to be taken away by death, &amp;c.
And why doth he suffer such varietie of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to come to them?<note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Iam. 1.</hi> because their

                  <hi>Blessed are those that suffer

drawes forth the treasures of his mercie. If the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
should be presently, it should not be so great
a reward; but when he suffers any man to doe well,
and then lets him waite, by that meanes he takes
occasion to be the more bountifull; as he sayth to
them,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb. 10. 36. When you haue done his will, you

doe, and so he might shew forth on you <hi>the riches,</hi>
and the Treasures <hi>of his mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly;<note place="margin">Reas. 5.</note> another reason why <hi>God</hi> doth it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2062:276"/>
the time of this life is the time of striving,<note place="margin">This life is a time of striving.</note>
of running, of acting, it is not the time of being
rewarded; as <hi>Iam. 1. 12. Blessed is he that indureth
the time of triall. God</hi> puts a man for the time of
this life to many trials, he puts a good man to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
many crosses and afflictions, to see whether he
will beare them or no, he giues not him present
libertie, present prosperitie, nor present rewards,
&amp;c. Sayth he, <hi>When he is tryed, then he shall receiue
the Crowne of glory, which he hath promised to them
that loue him:</hi> then, and not before; so, I say, the
time of this life is the time of striving.</p>
               <p>You know men doe not giue the reward till the
wrastling be done, they are not knighted, till the
battaile be ended, they giue not the garland, till
there be an end of the combate,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> Therefore <hi>Rom. 2. 5.</hi> The last day is called the manifestation, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his iust Iudgement;</hi> So that till then
there is no declaration of the just judgement of
<hi>God,</hi> one way or other; There is not a declaration
of wrath till then, nor a declaration of mercie till
then, for a time therefore, the <hi>Lord</hi> suffers them to
goe on, he dispenceth the event of good and evill,
of punishments, and rewards promiscously, that
the sonnes of men might be tryed; but when the
race is done, then he will make good his promise
to the one, and his threatnings vnto the other.</p>
               <p>But now, though the <hi>Lord</hi> doth this for a time,
as you see he doth for a season, yet (<hi>Beloved</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this againe for your comfort, that it is
but for a season, it shall not alwayes be so; as the
<hi>Wiseman</hi> resolues in the Chapter before my Text;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2062:277"/>
Sayth he, howsoever it fall out, <hi>I know it shall be
well with the righteous, and it shall be evill with the
wicked;</hi> It is certaine that <hi>every man shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
according to his workes. Godlinesse hath the
promise of this life, and of the life to come.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
vngodlines hath the curses of this life, and
of that which is to come; and certainely, they
shall be both fulfilled. And that it may be made
cleare to you, consider this ground for it, that
though the wicked prosper a while,<note place="margin">It shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way goe well with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> and good
men suffer affliction a while, yet it must needes be
that this must be the issue of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First,<note place="margin">Because God is a iust judge.</note> because <hi>the Iudge of all the world must needs
be righteous,</hi> as sayth <hi>Abraham;</hi> As if he should
say, the first standard of Iustice, the first rule, the
first measure, either that must be right, or els there
can be no rectitude in the world. Now that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be; you see there is a rectitude amongst men,
there is a justice amongst men, there is a kinde of
even carriage among the creatures, and therefore
the judge of all the world that giues all these rules,
that sets all these measures, all things in this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that keepes vp that which otherwise
would fall in sunder, surely he must needs be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and therefore he must needes doe well to
the righteous, and reward evill to the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this is cleare from his immutabilitie:
looke what <hi>God</hi> hath done in former times,<note place="margin">He is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> he
must needs doe the same; Goe through all the
Scriptures, and you shall finde that still the evill
in the end were punished, and the good in the end
were rewarded; he is the same <hi>God</hi> still, he is still
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2062:277"/>
as holy as he was, still <hi>his eyes cannot abide iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
still he is as powerfull as he was, <hi>there is no
change in him, nor shadow of changing.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinke with thy selfe, he that was so severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Saul</hi> for breaking the Commandement,
he that was so severe against <hi>Balaam</hi> for <hi>loving the
wages of vnrighteousnesse,</hi> he that was so severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Vzziah</hi> for touching the <hi>Arke,</hi> for medling
with holy things, for drawing neare in an vnholy
manner to him, he that consumed <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu
with fire from heaven,</hi> because they came with
<hi>strange fire,</hi> (so doe we when we come with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
affections to performe holy duties) he is the
same, and though he doe it not to thee on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
as he did to them, (for he did it to them for
example, that they might be rules for future times,
that he might not onely deliver precepts, but
might second them with examples,) yet being the
same <hi>God,</hi> he will doe it to thee at length, if thou
fall into the same sinne; he that strucke <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> with death for speaking against the
truth, and against their Consciences, he will doe
the same to thee, though he doe it not in the same
manner, (because it was extraordinarie, he drew
them out for examples,) and so I may say of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
it is certaine he will doe the same.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it must needes be so, because <hi>Gods</hi>
blessednesse stands in the execution of his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Law,<note place="margin">Gods blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes requires it</note> in proceeding according to it.</p>
               <p>Take all the Creatures <hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> and
their happinesse stands in keeping close to that
rule, that <hi>God</hi> hath given them: The fire is well, as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2062:278"/>
long as it followes that rule, the water, and so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Creature; Man to whom the Law was given,
his happines is to keepe the Law, <hi>in doing it thou
shalt liue:</hi> The great <hi>God</hi> hath made a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that is, he hath expressed himselfe, his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
consists in keeping it, and therefore be
assured, that whatsoever his Law is, it shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
be performed. The Law, you know, is this;
Either thou shalt keepe these things, or thou shalt
die for it. Now a disjunctiue proposition is true,
we say, if either part be true, that is, if a man doe
not keepe the Law, of necessitie he must be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
or else <hi>Gods</hi> Law should be broken; but if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be fulfilled, the Law is kept; So I say, it must
needs be, that the <hi>Lord</hi> must doe that, wherein his
blessednesse consists. <hi>Though a sinner prolong his
dayes, and though his punishment be long deferred,
and sentence be not speedily executed,</hi> yet certainely
it must needes be executed, for the <hi>Lord</hi> must
needs act according to that rule he hath set to
himselfe.</p>
               <p>Last of all, if the <hi>Lord</hi> should not doe it, he
should loose his glory; If wicked men should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prosper, if good men should alwayes fare
ill, men would say, there were no <hi>God</hi> in heaven,
to rule things, to administer things by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
therefore, sayth he, I will bring it to passe,
<hi>that you may know that I am the Lord.</hi> So then, seest
thou a wicked man doing wickedly, and yet not
punished? He cannot continue long; the <hi>Lord</hi>
should loose his glory if he should. Seest thou
a good man that continues in his righteousnesse,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2062:278"/>
and yet he suffers adversitie and affliction, he is
set in a low place, <hi>he walkes on foote, &amp;c.</hi> he cannot
continue so long; for the <hi>Lord</hi> should loose his
glorie, and the <hi>Lord</hi> will not loose his glorie, he is
exceeding tender of his glorie. And therefore
this Conclusion must be set downe, that though
for a time <hi>all things fall alike to good &amp; bad,</hi> though
<hi>God</hi> dispence them promiscuously for a season,
yet certainely the issue shall be, <hi>it shall be well with
the righteous, and it shall be ill with the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore (to proceede a little further) let not
holy men be discouraged,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> because they see things
goe ill with the Churches; be not discouraged at
it; for it shall be well with them in due season.
You shall see <hi>Psal.</hi> 129. 3.<note place="margin">Psal. 129. 3.</note> that the <hi>Lord</hi> suffers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

it lay a-sleepe you know many yeares. The

sentence went out from <hi>Gods</hi> Law, <hi>God</hi> and his
owne Conscience was against him, but yet it was
not executed, till he was full of gray haires; <hi>his
gray haires went downe to the graue,</hi> not in peace,
but in bloud.</p>
               <p>So likewise in the sinne of <hi>Saul;</hi> when he brake
the oath with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> the sinne continued
fortie yeares vnpunished; the <hi>Lord</hi> suffered it; the
sentence went out against him, as soone as it was
committed, but yet it lay a-sleepe; The <hi>Lord</hi> did
not execute the sentence till fortie yeares after, as
we see by computation: for it was all the Raigne
of <hi>David</hi> to the latter end, and most part of <hi>Sauls</hi>
Raigne.</p>
               <p>And so the sinne of <hi>Shemei,</hi> the sinne was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>But it will be objected,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> That many evill men
doe prolong their dayes, they liue long, they liue
till they be olde, and they liue in peace.</p>
               <p>To this I answer; That though they doe liue
long,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet indeede properly they are not said to
prolong their dayes, because that all that while
they are vnripe, they are not fit for death; So that
they are taken before they are fitted to goe hence,
so they are cut off for substance indeede in the

on the tree long, yet if it be taken before it be full
ripe, it may be said not to hang long on the tree,
that is, it hangs not so long, as to ripen it, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away in an vntimely manner, it is taken away
before the season of it; So it is here, though a
wicked man doe prolong his dayes, yet still he is
taken away before he be ripe, before the time of
gathering.</p>
               <p>As it is true on the other side, that holy men,
though they be taken away betimes, yet they are
taken away, when they haue finished their dayes;
he doth prolong his dayes, though he die when
he is young, because he is ripe before he is taken
from the tree; he is now in a fit season. And this
is the meaning of that, when he sayth, <hi>certainely
it shall be ill with him, that feares not God,</hi> though
he doe prolong his dayes, though execution
should be deferred. I should adde more, as this
for another; but I will but name it.</p>
               <p>Doth one condition fall to all,<note place="margin">Adversity and</note> both good and

good things, and all the evill things, that befall
vs in this life, they are neither truely good nor
truely evill, they are but shadowes of both; for if
the <hi>Lord</hi> send adversitie vpon good men, if he
send prosperitie to evill men; If there were true
evill in adversitie, <hi>God</hi> would never doe it, if there
were any true goodnesse in prosperitie, he would

of good things, and of evill, <hi>Larvae et spectra, &amp;c.</hi>
that is, they are not the substance of good things,
neither of good nor evill. Let not righteous men
therefore say they are miserable, when they fall

               <p>And so againe, if they fall out so promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

(but there he names onely the good and the

to say, as every man is; howsoever holinesse, and

of things, yet the naturall strength of men, their
naturall weaknesse, their naturall abilitie, or their

And therefore the <hi>Wiseman,</hi> when he had finished
that former conclusion, whereof we spake, that
there is one event to the good, and bad, he fals vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the second vanitie, that he saw vnder the Sun,
that not onely, as he sayth, All things come alike
to all, that is, to the holy and vnholy, but likewise,
to those that haue naturall strength, and those that

also, sayth he, all things come alike to all.</p>
               <p>For <hi>I haue seene that the race is not</hi> alwayes <hi>to the

that occasion makes men misse of them; therefore

the <hi>Wiseman, to their hurt,</hi> to the hurt of the ruler,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2062:286"/>
and to the hurt of them that are ruled. So that all
things vnder the Sunne, looke which way you
will, they are subject to vanitie, as these which
here he names, for a man to make himselfe strong,
for a man to get wisedome, and skill, and to be
diligent in his busines, &amp;c. For let a man vse the
likeliest meanes to bring his enterprises to passe,
yet, sayth <hi>Salomon,</hi> I haue seene, that <hi>the battaile
is not to the strong, nor favour to men of knowledge,
nor bread to the wise, nor riches to men of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
So that which way soever he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
still there was a vanitie. We will make some
briefe vse of it, and so come to the next poynt.</p>
               <p>If there be so much vanitie vnder the Sunne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
that even the best things,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> (those that seeme to be
most free from it,)<note place="margin">To see the change sinne hath made in the world.</note> are subject to vanitie; then</p>
               <p>First, let vs consider hence, what a change sinne
hath made in the world. The time was, my <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
when the <hi>Lord</hi> looked vpon all things, and
he saw, that <hi>they were all exceeding good;</hi> but now
when the <hi>Lord</hi> looketh, and the <hi>Wiseman</hi> looketh
vpon them with the same eye, they are all <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to vanitie.</hi> And whence hath this proceeded,
but because sinne hath blowne vpon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as it were, it hath blasted them, it hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away their vigor, the vertue, the beautie, the
excellencie of them? And if sinne hath made this
change, then consider, that the more sinne there
is, the more these things are subiect to vanitie.</p>
               <p>In every mans particular vse, you shall finde
this true: as in riches, a man that is sinfull, shall
not haue comfort from them, but <hi>vexation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:2062:286"/>
he shall finde a vanitie and an emptinesse in
them. And so wisedome, learning, knowledge,
and skill, the more sinne, the more vanitie is in
them: Euery man shall finde this in all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>vnder the Sunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As on the other side, the more grace, the more
substance you shall finde in them, and the lesse
vanity; For that which immediatly brings the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
is the curse, and sinne is the immediate cause
of euery curse. I say, the immediate cause of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
is the curse; of <hi>God.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> bids such
a thing wither, when he bids it not prosper with
such a man, when he bids it doe him no good,
(as hee bad the <hi>figg tree wither,</hi>) that makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing vaine to a man, euen the curse that
lies vpon the creature, and sinne is the cause of
the curse.</p>
               <p>Againe that which giues a substance, that
which giues a filling to the creature, that which
causeth it to giue downe that milke of comfort,
that is in it, is the blessing of <hi>God</hi> vpon it, when
<hi>God</hi> shall say to such a creature, goe and doe such
a man good; it is the blessing which doth it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly,
but grace is the cause of the blessing.
Therefore, let vs looke on sinne, as the cause of
all this vanitie, and on grace, as the cause of the
contrary, let vs labour to excell in the one, and to
resist the other. So much for this first vse.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> if there be such a vanity in all things
<hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To see the vanity of man</note> then surely he that hath brought
this vanitie vpon them must needes be much
more vainie. For what causeth this vanitie, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2062:287"/>
lieth vpon the whole face of the creature? is it
not man? it came not vpon the creature, as you
know, for its owne sake, but by man; why then
surely man, that hath bin the cause of all this vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
must needes be himselfe much more vaine.
Therefore, if a man looke vpon himselfe, let him
consider this, that he shall neuer find any happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
within his owne compasse, or circle; If hee
will needs build himselfe vpon his owne bottom,
he is subject to vanitie, and more then any other
creature besides, therefore let vs learne to goe out
of our selues, and seeke it else-where.</p>
               <p>Againe, if you seeke for any comfort from man,
from friends, from great men, remember they
are vaine,<note place="margin">Psal. 62. 9.</note> and more vaine then any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as in <hi>Psal. 62. 9. All men are vaine, and
great men are lvers, if they be layd in the ballance,
they be lighter then vanitie,</hi> that is, in all the sonnes
of men there is a vanitie, and the greater they are,
the more vanitie is in them; not that they are in
themselues more vaine, but because wee expect
more from great men, therefore to vs, they are
lighter then vanitie, they are more vaine then all
other men. Therefore let vs neither seeke that in
our selues, nor in other men: for they that cause
the vanitie vpon the creatures, themselues must
needes be much more subject to vanitie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Vse.</note> if the creature be subject to vanitie,
then consider what an euill choice wee make to
loose heauen,<note place="margin">It is an ill choise to loose heauen, to gaine the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.</note> to loose grace, to loose the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
of growing <hi>rich in good workes,</hi> for any
thing <hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> either for riches, or vaine
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2062:287"/>
glory and praise of men, for pleasures, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
men reckon precious, and pleasant to
them <hi>vnder the Sunne.</hi> For if they be all vanitie,
what a change doe wee make? doe wee not giue
gold away for drosse? as our <hi>Sauiour</hi> expresseth
it, <hi>Luke 16. 26.</hi> Put the case a <hi>man had all the world,
and loose his soule,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 26.</note> if he neglect the things
that belong to his saluation, and for the neglect
of them shal haue in recompence whatsoeuer the
world can afford him, so that hee wants nothing
that the world hath, yet sayth hee, what shall it
profit him? that is, there is a vanitie in it, it will
be altogether vnprofitable to him. For to be
vaine, and to be vnprofitable, is all one. Consider
then what a foolish change men make, when <hi>they
draw sin on with cart-roapes,</hi> that is, when they vse
their vtmost strength to get these vaine things to
them, with the losse of better things; what a
change doe they make, although they should
get the whole world, seeing all would be vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that is, they should finde nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and Emptines,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and vexation of spirit in it.</p>
               <p>Againe if all things be subiect to vanitie,<note place="margin">Not to desire them ouer much.</note> learne
we then, first, not to couet after earthly things, not
to set our hearts vpon it, nor to desire it over
much when we want it. And secondly, when we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
haue it, not to be confident,<note place="margin">Not to trust them ouer much.</note> nor to trust to much
to it, not to rejoyce in it to inordinately. For it is
but vanitie; there is an emptines in it; it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
vs, as a broken reede.<note place="margin">Not to grieue ouer much at the losse them.</note> Thirdly, if <hi>God</hi> doe
take from vs any of those earthly things, as riches,
credit, health, or friends, let vs be content to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2062:288"/>
part with them. For even the best of them are
vanitie, subject to emptines, such as will not
performe that, which they promise, such as will
deceiue vs, when we come to vse them,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Last of all (because this is not the point I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to stand vpon,)<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> if all things vnder the Sun
be subject <hi>to vanitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Labour to be weaned from them, and to feare God and keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> even those that seeme to be
least subject vnto it, then let vs labour to haue our
hearts weaned from the world, and whatsoeuer is
in the world, to make it our whole busines to <hi>feare
God and keepe his Commandements.</hi> You know that
is the maine vse that the wise man makes of this
whole booke; it is all but an explication of the
particular vanuties which hee found vnder the
Sun, and the vse that the makes of it, is this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
saith he, <hi>the whole dutie of man is to feare God
and keepe his Commandements.</hi> My beloved, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you marke that expression: for therein we
are exceeding apt to deceiue our selues; A man
is content to doe some thing, that tends to <hi>Gods</hi>
worship, and to the Saluation of his Soule, but to
make it his whole worke, to haue all the water
to runne in that chanell, to haue his mind alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
intent vpon it, he is not willing to doe so;
but hee joynes other things with it, because there
is a secret leaning of the heart, and an vnweaned
lingering after some other vanitie. It is certaine,
that when the heart is weaned from all things <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
the Sun,</hi> a man will make it then his whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
to <hi>feare God and keepe his Commandements,</hi>
but because the heart is false in this, it hath some
thing else that it is set vpon. Some men thinke
that wisedome &amp; knowledge, increase of Skill in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2062:288"/>
such a particular Science Trade and profession,
that that is not subject to vanitie, &amp; so it may be
his heart is set vpon that; &amp; this is enough to keep
a man from making it his whole dutie, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eare
<hi>God</hi> and keepe his commandements.</p>
               <p>Another man perhaps neglects this, but to
gather in an estate, to strengthen himselfe that
way, to bottom himselfe well vpon a good estate,
this he thinkes is not subject to vanitie, as other
things, and this therefore his heart is set vpon;
though hee see vanitie in some other things, yet
this his heart is set on; and this is enough to
keepe him from making it his whole dutie to
feare <hi>God,</hi> and keepe his commandements. And
thus we might goe through many instances. Let
every man therefore search his owne heart; (for
when a man makes not this his whole dutie, some
thing or other deceiues him, a vanitie that hee
yet seeth not.) I say, the best things be subject to
vanitie, if which way so euer the wise man tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himselfe, they were subject to vanitie, it is
fit we should learne then to make it our whole
dutie to set all our thoughts and affections vpon
this, how we may <hi>grow in grace,</hi> how wee may
<hi>feare God and keepe his Commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly a man may by this trie himselfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<note place="margin">tryall</note> he hath done it of no. For, as <hi>Salomon</hi> when
he grew wise, after his repentance, he saw <hi>a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
in all things vnder the Sunne:</hi> So a man when
his heart is once changed, he will see a vanitie in
all things.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing wherein thou seest not a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2062:289"/>
vanitie, it is an argument thou art not yet a new
creature. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>now know we no man after
the flesh; for whosoever is in Christ, is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
as if he should say, when any man is a new
creature; hee looketh vpon all things <hi>vnder the
Sunne</hi> with an other eye, he iudgeth of them with
another iudgment; and therefore if thou finde it
otherwise, if thou looke vpon the world, or vpon
any thing, that is in the world, as vpon things
that are precious, that is a signe that Sathan
hath bewitched thee. You know it was one (of
the witcheries that he attempted vpon our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>he shewed him the world, the kingdomes and
glory of it,</hi> and so he doth to euery man more or
lesse, he shewes him some thing or other, and if
a man doe not see the emptines and vanitie of
them, but sees a glorie in them, he hath yeelded
to Sathan who hath bewitched him, and preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ouer him: and therefore when you looke on
euery thing <hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> riches, credit, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
skill, knowledge, if you looke on all as on
flowers, if you see a vanitie, and an emptines in
them, that is a signe you are now changed, that
you are now turned to <hi>God</hi> by vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that you <hi>see a vanitie in all things vnder the
Sunne:</hi> So much for this first point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I returned and saw vnder the Sunne</hi> sayth hee,
<hi>that the race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the
strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of
vnderstanding, nor yet favour to men of knowledge,
but time and chance commeth to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:2062:289"/>The next point that we are to obserue in these
words, is this, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men of the greatest abilities, men of the greatest
sufficiencies, are often disappointed of their hopes
and ends.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> This is <hi>a vanitie vnder the Sun;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test abilities disappointed of their ends.</note> and not
so onely, but men that are more weake, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,
doe obtaine their ends and hopes. For
you must vnderstand it reciprocally, the battell is
not alwayes to the strong, therefore it is some
times to the weake; riches are not alwayes to
men of vnderstanding, therefore they are often
to men, that haue not vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>The opening of this point will be best done in
shewing the reasons, and grounds of it, why it
comes to passe, that men of the greatest abilities,
haue not alwayes successe answerable to that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,
that is in them.</p>
               <p>And first,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> one cause of it is, because there is no
creature, that is,<note place="margin">No man stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in his owne strength.</note> or euer shall bee strong in his
owne strength. <hi>In his owne strength shall no man
bee strong 1. Sam. 2. 9.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 9.</note> A creature in it selfe hath
not so much abilitie althought it be never so well
furnished, as to bring any enterprise to passe.
There is more required then the simple strength
of the creature, be it never so strong, because in
euery enterprise there are many wheeles; many
things that must concure to bring it to passe.
Now a creature is not able to see all the wheeles,
that are in every busines; or if hee doe see them,
he is not able to turne euery wheele, but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to <hi>God.</hi> And therefore without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with the creature, be the creature never
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2062:290"/>
so strong, hee shall not be able to get the battell,
be he neuer so swift, he shall not be able to winne
the race, bee hee neuer so great in skill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
hee shall not get fauour, nor riches.
This you may see 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 3.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 3.</note> Where <hi>Hanna</hi>
giues this counsell in her song, <hi>speake no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously,
neither let arroagancy come out of your
mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
are established:</hi> As if she had sayd, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to say hee is able to bring an enterprise
to passe, hee speakes presumptuously, hee takes
more to himselfe, then hee is able to performe;
The <hi>Lord</hi> is onely a <hi>God</hi> of knowledge, that is the
reason of it, and therefore by him onely, and not
by any mans strength enterprises are established;
<hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge,</hi> as if shee had sayd,
men haue not so much knowledge and wisedome
as to looke through a busines, to see all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of it, to behold all the ingredients
into it, all the wheeles that must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre to bring
it to passe; <hi>The Lord onely is a God of knowledge,</hi> and
therefore by him enterprises are established: And
this was that I sayd, that the creatures insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
was partly, because they are not able to see
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all. And partly agiaine it is,<note place="margin">The Creature is ignorant.</note> because though they
doe see all the wheeles that goe to make vp an
enterprise, yet they are not able to turne them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As you may see <hi>Psal. 33. 16. The King is not saved
by the multitude of an host,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is weake.</note> 
                  <hi>neither is a mightie man

thing to saue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he shall not deliuer any by his great

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2062:290"/>
can say, such a wheele is necessary, yet it is not in
his owne power to vse it.</p>
               <p>An hoast is a great meanes to get a battell, yet
sayth he, be an hoast never so strong, that is not
enough. But what if hee haue valiant men and
Souldiers? Yet that will not doe it, a mightie man
is not deliuered by his great strength. I, but what
if hee haue horses and chariots? &amp;c. Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
be what it will be, <hi>a horse is a vaine helpe,</hi>
that is, except the <hi>Lord</hi> concurre with that hoast,
and turne that great wheele, except hee bee with
those valiant men, except he concurre with the
strength of the horse and of the chariot, all this is
not able to doe it. And therefore I say, this is
one reason why the battell is not to the strong,
nor riches to men of vnderstanding, because the
creature of himselfe is not able to doe it, in its
owne strength, excluding <hi>Gods</hi> helpe, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring an enterprise to passe.</p>
               <p>This likewise may bee added to that, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
though the creature should haue a strength,<note place="margin">God can take away the vse of the strength they haue.</note>
though a man should haue all things readie, that
he should be furnished with preparations of all
sorts, so that nothing shuld be wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, to bring an
enterprise to passe, yet at the very time, at the very
instant, when the thing is to be done, it is not in
his power to make vse of them, because at that
very time <hi>God often takes wisedome from the wise,</hi>
and courage from them that are otherwise vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
he takes from them their abilities, euen at
that time hee takes off the chariot wheeles, even
when they are driuing of them; which plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2062:291"/>
proveth, that the Creature of himselfe is not
able to doe it: As we see,<note place="margin">Amos 2. 14. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 14. 15. 16. sayth
he, <hi>The flight shall perish from the swift, and the
strong shall not strengthen his forces. neither shall the
mightie saue his life, he that handleth the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w shall
not stand, and he that is swift of foote, shall not deliuer
himselfe, neither shall he that rideth the horse deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himselfe, and he of mightie courage among the
strong men shall flie away naked in that day:</hi> That is,
Be they never so strong, be they never so swift, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so full of courage, at the very time when they
haue occasion to vse it, the <hi>Lord</hi> will take away
that swiftnes, he will take away that courage, he
will take away that wisedome, and suggest it, it
may be, to the adversarie, and how then shall they
prevaile? So that though a man were never so
well prepared to bring an enterprise to passe, as
when a man purposeth in his heart, and hath laid
all things readie, this will I speake, yet <hi>the answer
of the mouth comes from God,</hi> whatsoever his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
and purposes be. So in the actions and
affayres of men, though he make his preparations
never so strong, yet at the very instant, <hi>God</hi> often
takes courage from those that are most valiant,
and suggesteth it to those that are most cowardly,
he takes away wisedome when they haue most
occasion to vse it, and giues it to the adversaries,
that otherwise are more foolish then they. This
is the first Cause of it.</p>
               <p>A second Cause is this;<note place="margin">2. Cause.</note> because there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time and opportunitie,<note place="margin">Men misse their times.</note> that a man must take
to bring an enterprise to passe, and though a man
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2062:291"/>
be never so strong, and never so wise, yet he may
misse of those opportunities, and so he looseth the
battaile, he looseth the bringing to passe of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.
And this we see is the Reason that is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Eccles. 8. 5. 6. The heart of the wise is to know
the time &amp; Iudgement, because to every purpose there
is a time and a Iudgement; therefore the miserie of
man is great vpon him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 5. 6.</note> That is, to every action and
to every purpose, there is a certaine opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
&amp; be a man never so well fitted, yet if he misse
of that opportunitie, he shall not bring his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
to passe, <hi>therefore,</hi> sayth he, <hi>the miserie of man
is great vpon him,</hi> for he neither knowes himselfe,
what that opportunitie is, neither can any man
tell him, as it is in the seaventh verse. And because
it is not within the power of man, it is not within
his compasse to finde out these seasons and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for every purpose and action, hence it is,
that though they be never so well prepared,
though they haue never so much sufficiencie, and
abilitie to bring such an enterprise to passe, yet
they misse of it, because they discerne not of the
times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly;<note place="margin">3. Cause.</note> this comes to passe,<note place="margin">From the changes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God.</note> because <hi>God</hi> hath
appointed a certaine varietie and change of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the sonnes of men; and there is no mans
wisedome, riches, or strength, that is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him from <hi>Gods</hi> appointment. I say, <hi>God</hi> hath
appointed a certaine change of condition to all
the sonnes of men, he hath appointed such crosses
and afflictions, he hath appointed such times, (as
the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> speakes) to passe over their heads,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2062:292"/>
and all the wisedome, and strength, that a man
hath, is not able to turne <hi>God</hi> from his purpose, it
is not able to evacuate &amp; to frustrate his decrees,
but they shall come to passe. And that is the
meaning of this in the text. (for I take this reason
out of the text,) The translation is, <hi>but time and
chance commeth to all,</hi> it were, I suppose, better tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
(and agrees with the originall) <hi>for time and
chance comes to all.</hi> Now by time in the text is
meant, that varietie of condition, that <hi>God</hi> hath
appointed to euery man vnder the Sunne, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
vseth the word,<note place="margin">Psal. 31. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Psal. 31. 15. My times are in
thy hands;</hi> My times, that is, the varietie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
the changes of my life, the good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
the prosperitie and adversitie that befals me,
sayth he, they are not in the hands of my enemies,
nor in mine own hands, but they are in thy hands
I say, there the word is so vsed, and so we are to
vnderstand it in this place, for time comes to all,
sayth he, that is, when <hi>God</hi> hath appointed such
changes to the states of men, if riches, if strength,
if wisedome, diligence, or skill, were able to turne
the counsels of <hi>God</hi> another way, if it were able
to anticipate them, or to diuert them, then the
battaile might be to the strong, &amp;c. but, sayth he,
it is not so; What <hi>God</hi> hath appointed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alter. You shall see it in many examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> was well established;<note place="margin">Instances.</note> but when <hi>God</hi> had
appointed a change of his Kingdome, that it
should go from him to <hi>David,</hi> you see he brought
it to passe. Though he were as strong as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> as
<hi>David</hi> testifieth of him, though hee had many
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2062:292"/>
children to inherit the Crowne, though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
claue fast to him (you doe not finde that ever
they rose vp in rebellion against him) yet when
<hi>God</hi> had appointed such a time to passe over him
and his house, all that strength, all that fitnes and
preparation that was in him, and his familie to
continue the Kingdome to his posteritie, it could
not turne aside <hi>Gods</hi> Counsell, but it came to
passe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ely</hi> had a great familie, there were many Priests
of his line; yet when <hi>God</hi> had said he would cut
off from <hi>Ely</hi> his whole familie, and would turne
the Priesthood to another, you see how he found
out meanes to bring it to passe; how many Priests
were killed in one day by <hi>Dveg</hi> in the time of <hi>Saul?</hi>
and afterwards, when <hi>Abiathar,</hi> one of that poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
was tooke in, by <hi>David,</hi> yet he was cast out
by <hi>Salomon,</hi> through an accident that fell out in
his adherence to <hi>Adoniah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> had said he would cut him off
and his posteritie, though he had seaventie sonnes;
you might wonder how it should come to passe,
that none of these sonnes should inherite the
Crowne, and yet all were cut off, and not a man
left by the hand of <hi>Iehu.</hi> When <hi>God,</hi> I say, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
varietie of changes, times, and conditions
to the sonnes of men, mans strength is not able to
divert his Counsell; and therefore <hi>the battaile is
not to the strong, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last reason is likewise here vsed,<note place="margin">4. Cause.</note> and <hi>chance
commeth to them all:</hi> That is, though a man be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so able, never so sufficient, never so well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2062:293"/>
to bring an enterprise to passe, yet some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
may turne it some other way, an accident
that he can neither foresee, nor prevent; Therefore
sayth the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> though he be never so wise,
chance may happen to him, he can neither foresee
all the accidents, that come to passe, or, if he
should, he knowes not how to prevent them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ahab,</hi> for ought we see, went well enough to
the battaile, <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> and he, yet, sayth the text,
a man drew a bow at adventure, &amp;c. (which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he could not foresee,) the man aymed no
more at <hi>Ahab,</hi> nor vnderstood it no more then the
arrow that he shot, but it was a meere accident
directed by <hi>God,</hi> that he could not foresee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haman</hi> thought he had made his preparations
strong enough to bring his enterprise to passe, to
overthrow the <hi>Iewes;</hi> there came an accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene,
the King could not sleepe, he cals for the
booke of the Chronicles, and turnes to that place
where <hi>Mordecaies</hi> discovery of a treason was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and so <hi>Mordecai</hi> was advanced, &amp;c. This
was a chance that befell him; although he were
never so well fitted to bring his enterprise to passe,
yet this he could neither foresee, nor prevent.
Many such instances we might giue.</p>
               <p>So you see now the reason of this, that men of
the greatest sufficiencie &amp; abilitie, men that haue
made their preparations most perfect, yet, they
doe not alwayes attaine to their hopes and ends;
And contrariwise, men that are more weake and
vnable, which haue not made such preparations,
they obtaine often their hopes and ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:2062:293"/>The vse wee are to make of it, is</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> let men learne from hence. Not to boast
of any outward strength, of any wisedome,<note place="margin">Not to boast of outward things.</note> in
that their foundation is made strong vnder them,
that they are well bottomed, that they are thus
compassed about with friends, and estate &amp;c.
For you see though a man intends to get by all
things, yet the event and successe comes not to
passe accordingly, but oft they faile and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
him. Therefore let not men boast of them;
be a man never so strong, never so wise, yet hee
may as soone faile as he that is weake, and most
foolish.</p>
               <p>See an example of it in <hi>Asa. 2. Cron.</hi> 14. 6. 7. 8.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 14. 6. 7. 8.</note>
You may see there how he built the Citties, hee
had made him strong Bulwarkes. There was not
a King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that wee reade of, that had
strengthned himselfe more then he; he had fiue
hundred and forescore thousand valiant men,
all well armed and appointed to beare the shield
and Speare; (The text sets it downe very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
that we might see <hi>Asa's</hi> safety, his strength
and his securitie, if you looke vpon the creature)
yet sayth the text the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> came against
him, with a thousand thousand men; whence I
gather this. That there is no man so safe and so
strong, but he is still subject to danger, and that
partly by reason of the vanitie of the creature.
For all the strength that a man hath, it is but the
strength of the creature, and the creature is made
of such brittle ingredients, that of it selfe it is
readie to moulder away and faile. There is not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2062:294"/>
in the creature it selfe any stabilitie, they are but
houses of clay, the best of the creatures, that is,
they are made of mouldring mettall, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to vanish of themselues, and if they were not,
yet there is some thing stronger. Let a man bee
never so strong, (who is the best of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
yet, man is but as the grasse, and as the
flower of the grasse. The grasse of it selfe oft-times
fades, though no Sithe come neere it, but if it
doe not fade of it selfe, yet it is cut downe: so
there is none so strong, but there may bee stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<hi>Asa</hi> was strong, but hee met with one that
was stronger then he, the <hi>Lubims</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians;</hi>
and yet as strong as they were, they met with one
that was stronger then they, because <hi>God</hi> did
helpe him, and assist him, so then let no man
boast of himselfe.</p>
               <p>If wisedome would keepe a man safe, <hi>Salomon</hi>
had never fallen as hee did. If possessions would
keepe a man safe, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> had never
bin ruined, as they were. If the fauour of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
could keepe a man safe, <hi>Haman</hi> had not had
that miserable end, that he had. If courage, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and valour could keepe a man safe, <hi>Ioab</hi> and
<hi>Abner</hi> had continued safe: but you know how
they both fell. So that you see nothing vnd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the
Sunne is able to keepe a man safe. Therefore let
not a man boast in any thing, that he hath; be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
never so wel appointed, let him haue all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
agree together, to make a hedge about him,
yet afflictions, crosses, and troubles will finde
some gap or other into that hedge, to breake in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2062:294"/>
vpon him. All things that he hath are subject to
mutability; Riches take themselues wings, and
flie away, that is, though a man thinke they are
sure, he cannot see how hee could easily be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
of them, yet sayth hee, they are as a
flocke of Birds,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that sit in a mans ground, hee
cannot promise himselfe any certaintie of them,
because they haue winges, and will flie away;
such are riches.</p>
               <p>And so credit; be a man never so innocent,
let him giue no occasion at all, let him keepe
himselfe never so blamelesse, and <hi>vnspotted of the
world,</hi> yet his credit is not in his owne keeping,
<hi>honor est in potestate honorantis &amp;c.</hi> Honour is not
in a mans owne power. You know though <hi>Ioseph</hi>
was very innocent, yet he was blamed; &amp; so <hi>David
&amp; Christ.</hi> And as it is sayd of honour, so it may be
of all the rest, wealth, and friends, and whatsoever a
man hath; let no man boast himselfe, because he is
a strong man, because he is of vnderstanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is rich, because he is of abilitie in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,
because hee is a man of skill, for by these
things he shall not obtaine his ends and hopes.</p>
               <p>Nay, my beloved, let me be bold to adde this.
If a man begin to thinke himselfe safe for these,
and to grow confident vpon them, and say thus
with himselfe and his owne heart, well, now I am
thus and thus rooted, I am now compassed about
with these and these helpes, I see not now how I
shuld be remoued; let him know this, that <hi>God</hi> wil

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2062:295"/>

               </p>
               <p>I say <hi>God</hi> will doe it so much the rather, partly,

                  </note> and when a

                  <hi>David</hi> giues this reason, why he
should prevaile against <hi>Goliah,</hi> it is not I, but the
<hi>battle,</hi> sayth he, <hi>is the Lords,</hi> as if hee should say,
if the battle were mine, or thine, it may bee, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi>
thou mightest prevaile against mee, it may

the <hi>Lords:</hi> So we may say in this case. The event

comes to a man, vpon that preparation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
that hee makes, it is the <hi>Lords,</hi> and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans, nor any creatures. Therefore when a
man challengeth it to himselfe and boasts of it,
and thinkes I will doe this, the <hi>Lord</hi> will not doe
it, the battaile is his, and as it is said of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,

<hi>Beloved,</hi> when men goe well prepared to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,
and doe overcome, there is a providence of
<hi>God</hi> in that, as well as when they get the battaile
by some chance, or accident; but by reason of the
infirmitie of man, by reason of the iniudiciousnes
that he is subject vnto, they doe not so much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this providence in an ordinary course,
as they doe in accidentall things, that are done by
occasion, by sudden intercurrent causes, that wee
are not able to fore-see. Therefore, I say, <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to doe it so much the rather, when men are
prepared, and say with themselues, what should
hinder me? What should keepe me from bringing
such an enterprise to passe? <hi>God</hi> therefore puts in
some accident, and turnes it another way, that his
providence might be seene and acknowledged.
The Conclusion is, let none boast themselues,
that this and this I will doe, because I am strong,

for <hi>God</hi> will turne all a contrary way. So much

               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">2. Vse.</note> As men are not to boast themselues
when they are strong;<note place="margin">Not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</note> So likewise if the battaile

he is weake, because he is vnprepared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

he saw this, he sayth, he will <hi>reioyce in his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
That is, he thought his infirmities would be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2062:296"/>
a very great advantage to him, partly, because they
would keepe him humble; that is one reason;
And partly, because he thought that <hi>God</hi> would
the rather put forth his power, because he was
weake, that he should the rather haue <hi>Gods</hi> power
to vphold him. Therefore, I say, let not men be
discouraged for their weakenesse; be the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
never so strong, and their resolutions never
so fixed, yet they shall not prevaile, if <hi>God</hi> haue
purposed otherwise.</p>
               <p>You see how peremptorie <hi>Iezabels</hi> speech was,
<hi>God doe so and so, &amp;c. if I make no Eliah as one of
the Prophets of Baal by to morrow this time;</hi> yet
you see he was safe notwithstanding this.</p>
               <p>Thus was it also when the <hi>Iewes</hi> had vowed with
themselues the death of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aul;</hi> he was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
there was fortie to one, and their resolution
was so strong, as it could not be altered; yet <hi>God</hi>
kept him safe, he prevailed, and they were disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Elisha,</hi> when the King thought to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off his head, though he had the power of a
King, and his purpose was firme, that it should
come to passe, to a full height, there was no doubt
made of it, yet <hi>God</hi> kept him safe.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let vs be incouraged on the other
side that are weake, <hi>God</hi> is able to hide vs, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to strengthen vs, to giue vs advantage and
successe, when we are vnable to helpe our selues:
for as it is true, that <hi>the battaile is not</hi> alwayes <hi>to the
strong, nor favour to the wise, &amp;c.</hi> So it is ture on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2062:297"/>
the other side, that many times when men are
not strong, when men are not wise, when they
mannage not their businesse with that prudence,
warinesse, and circumspection that they
should doe, yet oftentimes they
haue successe, when the
other want it.</p>
               <p>So much shall serue for this time.</p>

vs then not to be lifted vp, but to be thankefulls in
our best successe, and on the contrary, not to be

since that, as you see, so often failes.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2062:298"/>
The Creature hath not power enough in it selfe
to bring any enterprise to passe, it can neither see
all the wheeles, that tend to make vp an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
or though it see them, it is not able to turne
them all. And therefore if it be done, it is the
<hi>Lord</hi> that doth it, and the prayse is onely to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi> this is a necessary poynt. It is vsuall
with vs to be very earnest with <hi>God,</hi> when a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is to be done; but we forget to prayse him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
And whence proceedes this, but from
a secret attribution of what is done to our owne
wit, to our owne strength, to our owne policie,
to other occasions? Whereas if he were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
we should be readie to giue him the praise
of all that we doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> was a wise man, yet you shall finde,
1 <hi>Sam. 18.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.</note> he did not therefore carrie himselfe
wisely in all his affayres, because he had an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
gift of wisedome, but, sayth the text, <hi>because
the Lord was with him.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> was with him to
guide him in euery action, to direct him what to
doe vpon euery particular occasion, and thence it
was, that he carried himselfe wisely in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a valiant man, and a potent; yet the
Scripture attributes it not to his strength that he
prevailed as he did, but sayth, that <hi>he was GODS
Shepheard,</hi> he was his instrument, it was <hi>God</hi> that
vsed him, it was <hi>God</hi> that wrought his worke for
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a mightie potent Prince,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2062:298"/>
and prevailed which way soev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
yet <hi>God</hi> tels him, it was he that <hi>gaue him do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and victorie</hi> wheresoever he went</p>
               <p>And as it is true on this hand, so it is likewise
on the other; when a man hath ill successe in any
busines, let him not say, it was because he did not
mannage it wisely, because he had su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h an enemy
to oppose him, or because such an accident fell
out to crosse him; no, that is not the cause; The
Reason is here rendred: <hi>for time and hance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens</hi>
to every man: That is, if there he any such
accident, if there be any crosse event fals out to
hinder him in his enterprise at that time, it is in
<hi>Gods</hi> disposing, it is <hi>God</hi> that hath done it. And
therefore you see, in the evill events, that haue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any occasion befallen the Church, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the phrase of Scripture, it is not attributed
to them, but to <hi>God.</hi> When the spirit of <hi>Pul,</hi> and
<hi>Tiglapellezer,</hi> were stirred vp against the people of
<hi>Israell,</hi> sayth the Text, 1 <hi>Chron. 5.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chro 5. 26.</note> the <hi>Lord stirred
them vp</hi> against the people; it was not they that
did it, but it was the <hi>Lord,</hi> that stirred them vp.</p>
               <p>So likewise he poured forth his wrath by the
<hi>hands of Shishak;</hi> and, as <hi>David</hi> expresseth it in
his owne case, <hi>God hath bidden Shemei curse David.</hi>
So it is in many other places. Therefore let not
men sit downe discouraged, vexing themselues,
and eating vp their hearts with griefe. Let not
men say, If such an accident had not beene, I had
prevailed; for, it is this <hi>time and chance,</hi> that turnes
the event of businesses, which is from the <hi>Lord,</hi>
and not from man. Therefore labour to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2062:299"/>
to him in the best successe, and not to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to your owne wits, or to giue him thankes in
a formall manner, but heartily to acknowledge
him; And likewise to be patient in all the cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es
and troubles that befall vs. So much for this
third vse.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> and lastly; If men of the greatest abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
be so often disappointed,<note place="margin">Not to make flesh our arme.</note> that <hi>the battaile is
not to the strong, nor the race to the swi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, &amp;c.</hi> Then
learne we hence, not to <hi>make flesh our arme,</hi> not to
trust in any strength of our own, in any wisedome
of our owne, or other mens; for if this would doe
it, if the strength of any man, if the policie of any
man were able to bring any enterprise to pafse,
it would alwayes doe it; If it were the swiftnesse
of him that runs, that could get the race, If it were
the strength of him that fighteth, that could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the battaile. I say, it would alwayes doe it:
And therefore seeing it fals not out so, but thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
are turned a contrary way, that is a signe
it is not in them, but in something else. Therefore,
I say, take we heede of making flesh our arme,
of saying thus with our selues, because we haue
these preparations, because we haue these meanes,
therefore our worke shall succeede: for that is not
so; for we see often in experience, when a man
comes to a businesse with much confidence, out
of a reflection vpon his owne abilitie to doe it,
for the most part it succeeds ill: As on the other
side, when a man comes with feare and diffidence
in himselfe, for the most part he prospereth best.
And you haue a rule for it,<note place="margin">Ier. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Iere. 17. Cursed is he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2062:299"/>
that makes flesh his arme;</hi> Cursed <hi>is he,</hi> that is <hi>God</hi>
hath ingaged himselfe, when a man will make flesh
his arme, to blow vpon his enterprises, and to
cause them to wither.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>blessed is he, that trusts in the Lord,</hi>
that is, <hi>God</hi> is tied by his promise to giue successe
in such a case. Therefore that vse we should make
of it, not to trust to our owne strength, to our
owne wisedome, nor to other mens. For, <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
what is it, when we haue other men that are
strong, and wise, and potent to rest vpon? Are
they able to bring it to passe? You shall finde that
expression <hi>Psal. 31.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 31.</note> a place that I touched in the
morning vpon another occasion; <hi>David</hi> tels vs
there, that <hi>great men sat and spake against him,</hi>
and consulted together to take away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is life; but,
sayth he, <hi>my times are in thy hands:</hi> As if he should
say, my times, and the disposing of all my affaires,
good &amp; evill successe to me, they are not in their
hands, be they never so potent, they are not in the
hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> they are not in the hands of <hi>Doeg,</hi>
they are not in the hands of all mine enemies,
but <hi>Lord, my times are in thy hands.</hi> So then, if we
could learne this lesson aright, we should not be
discouraged, when the most potent men are set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, not be much incouraged when they are
for vs. That in <hi>Isa. 51. 12.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 51. 12.</note> is excellent for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

man, whose breath is in his nostrils, and who shall be
made as the grasse?</hi> That is, if such a man be never
so potent, yet, sayth he, consider his br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath is in
his nostrils, and he shall be made as the grasse:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2062:300"/>
that is,<note place="margin">Why we feare men.</note> in truth he is of no power. But the reason
now why men doe feare, why men are discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in such cases, you shall finde in the verse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
who art thou, sayth he, that doest this,
<hi>and forgettest the Lord thy maker, who made heaven
and earth, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and laid
the foundations of the earth?</hi> You never finde a man
that feares a great man, a potent man, but the true
ground of it is, because <hi>he forgets the Lord his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;</hi>
if he did remember the mightie <hi>God,</hi> he that
stretcheth forth the heavens, and that layes the
foundations of the earth; Man would appeare a
mortall man. You may take it for a certaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rule, a mans heart is never possessed with feare,
vpon such an occasion, but when he forgets <hi>God,</hi>
the great <hi>God;</hi> he would never else feare a great
man. On the other side, he would never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
in such occasions, but when he remembers
not the <hi>Lord.</hi> Therefore learne we neither to feare
them, when they are against vs, or to trust them
when they are for vs.</p>
               <p>We vsually pittie the case of Marchants, for say
we, their goods hangs on ropes, they depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vncertaine windes; but certainely, he that
trusts in man, is in a worse condition; for he rests
vpon the affections of a man, that are more vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
then the winde. What so brittle, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant?
We see that for the most part they are
carried to doe vs good or evill with by-respects,
with something touching themselues, they are
turned to and fro, as the Weather-cocks and Mils
are, that when the winde ceaseth, and when the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2062:300"/>
waters fayle, stand still, they are driven to doe for
vs so long as such respects leade them, no longer.
And therefore, to trust in men, it is not the safest,
it is not the wisest way. See this in some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
<hi>David</hi> how inconstant did he finde the
people,<note place="margin">Instances of inconstancy.</note> and apt to rebell against him? and so <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
yea, <hi>David</hi> himselfe, though he was a holy
men, yet how inconstant was he, inconstant to
<hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> one that was innocent, one that
had never done him any wrong, one that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
given him occasion? How inconstant was he
to <hi>Ioab,</hi> when he had prevailed in that battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Absolom?</hi> How quickly was he out of grace
and place, when he had saved <hi>Davids</hi> life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Kingdome, and <hi>Amaziah</hi> that was
but a reconciled enemy put into his roome?
These and many such like examples you shall find.
<hi>Abner</hi> how inconstant was he to <hi>Ishbosheth?</hi> even
for a word spoken against him, and a word that he
gaue him occasion enough to speake, a word that
he neede not haue beene so much offended at, he
fals off from him for it; and this it is to trust in
man; I say, either in a mans owne wisedome, or
strength, or in any other mans. This place shewes
what a great follie it is. <hi>The battaile is not to the
strong:</hi> That is, let a man be never so well compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
about with strength, and wisedome of men, let
him put himselfe, and his friends into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
yet he is not safe; but let him trust in <hi>God,</hi> and
he is safe in midst of dangers. <hi>Sampson</hi> and <hi>Ishbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi>
when they were in the midst of their friends,
when they were asleepe, they were circumvented.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2062:301"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> on the other side, when he was asleepe in
the midst of his enemies, when there was an hoast
pitched against him, yet, sayth he, <hi>I laid me downe
and slept:</hi> Why? <hi>because the Lord sustained me.</hi>
So that both for our safetie when we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and likewise to haue our workes wrought
for vs, to trust in <hi>God,</hi> and not to trust either in
our owne wisedome, or in the wisedome, or
strength of man, that we shall finde constantly to
be the best way.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> abstained from going vp to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
against <hi>Naball,</hi> when he tooke the counsell of
his wife, and when he abstained from putting vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands vpon <hi>Saul,</hi> you see how <hi>God</hi> wrought
it for him: he gaue him <hi>Nabals</hi> wife, he gaue him
<hi>Saules wiues, and his houses, and his Kingdome into
his hands;</hi> this he got by trusting him. But when
men will make their owne wayes, when they will
goe about enterprises with their owne wisedome,
<hi>In his owne wisedome and strength shall no man be
strong: God</hi> hath said it, and he will make it good
vpon all occasions. The conclusion therefore is,
if the battaile be not to the strong, nor the race to
the swift, &amp;c. <hi>If men of the greatest abilitie are often
disappointed of their hopes and ends,</hi> then we should
not make flesh our Arme, but trust in <hi>God,</hi> both
for safetie in danger, and to bring our enterpises
to passe. And so much for this point. Wee now
proceede.</p>
               <q>Neither doth man know his time.</q>
               <p>This is added, partly as a second vanitie, which
<hi>Salomon</hi> saw <hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> and partly as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2062:301"/>
of the former. For, sayth he, though men be
strong, and wise, yet there is a certaine season to
doe things in, that they may mistake, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them to fayle; <hi>for man knowes not his time:</hi>
and from hence he drawes this Consequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men know not their times, <hi>therefore they are
snared in an evill time,</hi> because they know not the
good time, when good actions should be done,
therefore evill times come vpon them suddenly,
that is, they take them vnawares; and this he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
by two Similitudes, <hi>They come vpon them,</hi>
sayth he, <hi>as an evill net comes vpon fishes, and as the
snare vpon the fowles.</hi> So that in these three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
you shall haue the full meaning of these
words; and these therefore wee will handle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
               <p>First, that there is a time allotted for every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and to every businesse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is very hard to finde out that
time.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, because men cannot finde this
time, but mistake it, therefore evill times come
vpon them suddenly, that is, crosses, afflictions,
and destruction comes vpon them suddenly, even
<hi>as the snrre vpon the fowle, and as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et vpon the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.</hi>
And that this is the meaning of this place,
and that these three points are included in it, you
may see best by comparing it with another of the
like sence,<note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 4. 5. 6. 7.</note>

purpose, and to every action, that he might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to men that vanitie to which they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and likewise that he might inflict his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
vpon them; The miserie of man is great
vpon him, because every purpose hath a time.</p>
               <p>But how shall this be proved?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He proues it by this;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> for, sayth he, <hi>he knowes
not what shall be;</hi> for who can tell him what shall
be? That is, as if he should say, If a man did know
this time, he were safe enough, he were free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2062:302"/>
from miserie, but since he neither knowes
it himselfe, nor is there any that can tell him,
therefore the miserie of man is great vpon him.
Thus you see that in both these places these three
poynts are included, and these I will run over, and
so make vse of them.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>there is a certaine time, that God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to every purpose,</hi> and to every businesse;
If you take that time, you may succeede in it, if
you misse it, it is exceeding dangerous. As you
shall see <hi>Eccles. 3.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 3.</note> To all things there is an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, to every purpose vnder heaven; There is
a time to be borne, and a time to die, a time to
plant, and a time to pull vp; a time to slay, and a
time to heale, &amp;c. A time to weepe, and a time to
laugh. All these particulars mentioned by <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
may be divided into these three rankes; for
all naturall actions, as well as those that are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie,
and done by consultation, there is a time
that <hi>God</hi> hath set.</p>
               <p>Againe, for all lighter actions, as well as for
actions of moment, there is a time.</p>
               <p>Againe, for all private actions, as well as for
those that are publique, there is a time, that is, not
a time which man in prudence will chuse out but
a time which <hi>God</hi> hath appointed, a time which
<hi>God</hi> hath set downe; if a man hit vpon that time
which <hi>God</hi> hath allotted, he shall succeede in it,
ots<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erwise he failes. So you see <hi>Act. 17. 26.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17. 26.</note> he
hath made of one bloud all mankinde to dwell
vpon the face of the earth, and hath assigned the
times that were ordained before, and the bounds
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2062:303"/>
of their ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itations; That is to say, the times of
every man, the times for every mans state and
condition, the times for the severall changes to
which every man, every Common-wealth, and
every Cittie is subject, these times <hi>God</hi> hath assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he hath ordained them before, and they are
as bounds that cannot be passed. The like you see
<hi>Iob</hi> 14. 5. 6.<note place="margin">Iob. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Are not his dayes determined, and the
number of his moneths with thee, thou hast ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
his bounds that he cannot passe.</hi> (Marke it)
As if he should say; There is not a man comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, but <hi>God</hi> hath appointed him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
bounds, he cannot passe the number of his
moneths; That even as a man deales with an
hireling, (for that Similitude he vseth presently
after in the next verse,) he agrees with him for
such a time; So long you shall worke and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
So sayth he, <hi>God</hi> hath appointed every man
so many moneths, so many yeares, he must doe
him service, some ten yeares, some twenty yeares,
some fortie yeares: As you see it is said of <hi>David,
Act.</hi> 13. 35.<note place="margin">Act. 13. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>When he had served his time by the
Councell of God.</hi> As if he should say; There is an
appointed time that <hi>David</hi> had to do him service
in, he did him service as a King. And so in the
same Chapter, it is said, <hi>Iohn Baptist, when he had
finished his course, &amp;c.</hi> That is; There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
race that he was to run; he could not come
short of it, nor he could not goe beyond it. So that
both to the actions of men, to every purpose, to
every action, and busines that is done in the life of
a man, there is a certaine time appointed, there is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2062:303"/>
a certaine time that <hi>God</hi> hath allotted, and as a
man obserues this time, So is it better or worse
with him.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the second, let me shew
you the Reasons in a word, why <hi>God</hi> hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
these times, <hi>God</hi> hath set these times: That is,
<hi>God</hi> hath appointed such times for busin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sses, for
every purpose;<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> partly, because they cannot be
done in another time: and therefore it is said to
be an allotted time; If you take another time, you
may labour, and labour in vaine: As you see <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
3. 9.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 9.</note> after he had sayd, <hi>there is a time for every
purpose,</hi> he addes this, <hi>and what profit hath he that
workes of the thing wherein he travels;</hi> As if he
should say, If a man misse of these times, what
profit is there of his worke, though he travaile ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so diligently in it, if he misse his time, if he
pitch not right vpon his time, <hi>God</hi> workes not
with him, there is no concourse with him, so he
labours in vaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> There is an allotted time, because
<hi>God</hi> in his providence, in all his workes, he doth,
what he doth, in measure, in number, he waighes
every thing, and makes it beautifull; now euery
thing is beautifull in its season; out of its season,
it is not beautifull. And that is another reason,
that he likewise here renders, vers. 11. <hi>he hath
made every thing beautifull in his time,</hi> therefore
there is a time allotted to euery action, and to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
purpose: because if it misse of this time, it is
not beautifull, there is a desormitie, there is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquitie
in it, the beautie, the preciousnes, and the
comelinesse of it, is lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:2062:304"/>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> hath appointed a certaine time,
he hath allotted a time to euery action, out of his
owne royall prerogatiue, he will not haue men
to know the times; but the times must be of his
allotting, he hath appointed a time to euery thing,
wherein his great soveraignty over the creatures,
and over all things appeares; and therefore you
shall see,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Act. 1. 7. It is not for you,</hi> sayth he, <hi>to
know the times, and seasons,</hi> neither to know them,
nor appoint them; for, sayth he, those the <hi>Lord</hi>
keepes in his owne power; and therefore it it he
that hath allotted a time to euery thing. It is he
also that concealeth and hideth them from the
sonnes of men. And this is the first point; That
to every action there is a time appointed.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">It is hard to finde out the time.</note> to finde out this time, is exceeding
hard, because it is not in the power of any man to
know it, except <hi>God</hi> guide him to see it, there are
not principles in man, there is not the sufficiencie
of wisedome, to finde out the fitnes of time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>God</hi> guide him to pitch vpon that time.</p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Lord</hi> were pleased to reveale to men
these seuerall times, allotted to actions, it were an
easie thing to finde it out: but he hath kept them
to himselfe, and that for these two Causes.</p>
               <p>One is;<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> That men might watch, for if men
knew the time,<note place="margin">To teach vs watchfulnes.</note> they would be loose, and neglect,
till the time came; Therefore, sayth he, seeing
thou knowest not the time when he will come,
whether at night, or at what time of the night,
whether at the dawning, or at the Cocke-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whether at the first watch, or at the second,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2062:304"/>
therefore <hi>watch;</hi> As if he should say, If men knew
the time certainely, they would sleepe till that
time, and then they would be awake; but <hi>God</hi>
will haue men watch.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> hath appointed these times, and
reserved them to himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,<note place="margin">That men may lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne to feare the <hi>Lord,</hi> and depend vpon him.</note> that men might learne
to feare him, that they might learne to keepe a
continuall dependance vpon him, for if the times
were in our owne hands, we might mannage our
businesse with our owne strength, but when they
are in <hi>Gods</hi> hands, we know not what <hi>to morrow
will bring forth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam 4.</note> Therefore <hi>Iames</hi> sayth, say not,
<hi>I will doe such a thing, I will goe to such a place, and
stay there a yeare, and buy and sell;</hi> for, sayth he, it is
not in your hands, your life is not in your owne
hands to effect this busines. If you doe liue, it is
not in your hands; and therefore <hi>you ought to say,
if the Lord will.</hi> And therfore to keep men in this
dependancie vpon him, <hi>God</hi> hath reserved these
times vnto himselfe.</p>
               <p>The third,<note place="margin">3. Proposit.</note> and last proposition is, That because
men misse of these times, therefore <hi>their miserie is
great vpon them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Because men mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>all into miserie.</note> partly, because they do not effect
the thing they goe about, when they misse of their
time; for the <hi>Lord</hi> workes not with them, when
they hit vpon a wrong time; partly also because
they fayling in their dutie, not taking the good
time that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed, he in his most just
judgement sends vpon them <hi>evill times,</hi> that <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
come vpon them, euen as a snare vpon the birds.</hi>
As you see when birds are feeding quietly and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing, then an evill snare comes and takes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2062:305"/>
them; So it is with men, when they haue missed
their times, when they thinke they are safest, when
they speake peace to themselues; when they thinke
that danger is farthest off, then <hi>evill times come
suddenly vpon them.</hi> This you shall see best in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gehezi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instances.</note> when he tooke a gift of <hi>Naaman;</hi> The
Prophet his Maister reproues him in these words;
<hi>Gehezi,</hi> sayth he, <hi>is this a time to receiue gifts?</hi> As
if he should say; To take a gift in it selfe is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse;
but this is not a time for it: for <hi>Naaman</hi> was
but a stranger.</p>
               <p>Againe, he was but a beginner in beleeving, in
the true <hi>God,</hi> and therefore to take a gift of him,
that was not a time.</p>
               <p>It was the manner (you know) to bring gifts
to the olde Prophets, not for reward of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
but for the maintenance of their estate;
So <hi>Saul</hi> brought to <hi>Samuel</hi> a gift, and therefore
in some cases it might haue beene seasonable, but
sayth he, is this a time to take a gift of such a man,
vpon such an occasion, at such a season? And what
miserie came vpon <hi>Gehezi</hi> for missing his time?
sayth his Maister; <hi>The leprosie of Naaman the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
shall cleaue to thee,</hi> that miserie came vpon
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So you shall see</hi> Haggai 1.<note place="margin">Haggai 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The people did a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
action, but they missed of the time;</hi> Thus sayth
the Lord of hosts; This people say the time is not yet,
when the Lords house should be built: Then came the
Word of the Lord, by the ministerie of the Prophet
Haggai, saying, Is it a time for your selues to dwell in

saith the Lord of hosts, you haue sowne much, but you
haue brought in little, you eate, but you haue not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
you drinke, but you are not filled, you cloath you,
but you are not warmed, and he that earneth wages,
he puts it into a broken bagge. <hi>It was a lawfull thing
for them to build houses to dwell in, and to enioy,
but, sayth he,</hi> is this a time to dwell in your seeled
houses? <hi>As if he should say, You haue mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed of
the time. And what then? You see therefore their
misery was great on them;</hi> you haue sowne much,
but you bring in little, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iacob,</hi> It was lawfull for him to haue sought the
blessing, but, because he missed of the time, you
see his misery was great vpon him, how many
sore yeares of travaile had he vnder his vncle <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban?</hi>
And this was because he missed of his time.</p>
               <p>On the other side, <hi>David</hi> that did hit vpon his
time, <hi>God</hi> promised him a Kingdome, and he stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his time, you see he had it with good successe,
he had it in such a manner, as was fit for him; for
he stayed his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is another example, when he consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the olde men; They tolde him, that if he
would <hi>serue the people at that time, they should be his
servants for ever;</hi> but he followed the counsell of
the young men, and you see what fell out vpon
this, the missing of his time; for that was the
counsell that the olde men gaue him, if thou wilt
serue them <hi>at this time, &amp;c.</hi> As if they had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yd,
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> thou thinkest it will be disadvantage to
thee, if thou let the raines loose vpon them; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2062:306"/>
not restraine, and curbe them in the beginning,
but thou missest of thy time: There is a time for
meeknes, and a time for roughnes; There is a
time for clemencie, there is a time againe for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie,
but this is not a time for <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to vse
severitie, in the beginning of his Raigne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you see <hi>his miserie was great vpon him,</hi> he lost
ten tribes by this meanes.</p>
               <p>So likewise, The people of <hi>Israell,</hi> when they
sought a King for themselues, it was lawfull for
them to seeke a King; for <hi>God</hi> had appointed from
all eternitie <hi>David</hi> to be their King, and if <hi>Saul</hi>
had not beene their King, <hi>David</hi> had beene King
at the same season that he was; but their error was
in the time, they would haue a King, when <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>

therefore he sayth, that himselfe ruled over them;
and therefore <hi>God</hi> tels them, because they would
needes haue a King now, because they would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
him, (they would haue a King before <hi>God</hi>

and make them Apothecaries, he shall take
your Vineyards, and your Oliue trees. Thus your
King shall doe to you, because you haue missed
your time, your <hi>miserie shall be great vpon you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like you shall see in the Children of <hi>Israell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Num. 14.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> The people might lawfully fight against

the <hi>Cananites,</hi> you know, they were brought forth
for that purpose; yet because they missed of their
time, they would doe it at that time when they
were not appointed, <hi>Moses</hi> tels them if they would
needes goe vp, they should fall before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and accordingly it fell out so; for they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of their time. I neede not run through more
examples, <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> if you lay these two
examples together; you shall finde, <hi>David</hi> went
not out to warre when he should; and the other
went when he should not, and so missed of their
times; and you see what miserie it brought vpon
them, vpon <hi>David</hi> it brought the greatest misery
of all other, which was the giuing of him vp to
such sinnes, as that of murther, and adulterie, that
brought all the evill that he suffered afterwards.
And <hi>Iosiah,</hi> it cost him his life: for he went out
vnseasonablie, and did mistake the time which
<hi>God</hi> had allotted for such an enterprise. So you
see now these three; there is a time allotted to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
purpose, to every busi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es. And it is hard to
know it; for <hi>God</hi> keepes it to himselfe, he reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it when it pleaseth him, he pitcheth one man by
his providence, by the secret guidance of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
vpon a right time, when another misseth it,
I meane not that it is alwayes done in mercie,
but in the ordinary disposition of time, to them
that know him not; for when a man pitcheth vpon
the time, it is he that guides him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>because men misse of their time, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie
is great vpon them,</hi> it comes vpon them; that
is, some evill times come vpon them suddenly,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2062:307"/>
it comes vpon them like a snare.</p>
               <p>Now briefly,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> the vse we should make of it, is
this,<note place="margin">Not onely to looke to our actions, but the time of them.</note> That we be carefull, not onely to doe the
actions that belong to our Callings, either our
generall Calling, as we are Christians, or our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Calling, in our ordinarie busines, it is not
enough to doe them, but to looke narrowly to the
time. It is a Rule among Divines, that an action
is not good, except it haue all the Circumstances
good. An action may be evill vpon missing any
one, therefore the time is an ingredient into the
goodnesse of the action, were the action never so
good, if the time be missed, it makes the action
evill when we doe it out of its season; when wee
doe it not in its time. As it is said of words, when
they are <hi>in season; they are beautifull:</hi> So it is true
of euery action, when it is done in its owne season
it is beautifull, if it be not, there is some deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in it, some obliquitie, and by consequent, some
sinfulnesse, if it be a morall action, or somewhat
that brings evill after it, if it be an action of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature. Now, the actions wherein we are
to looke so narrowly to our times, are of three
sorts.</p>
               <p>Some are the actions that <hi>God</hi> hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

vnseasonably to him that admonisheth, or to
him that is admonished, it spoyles the action.
To be thankful for mercies, and to pay our vowes,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2062:307"/>
it is a good action; but yet if the time be missed,
and we giue not thankes in due season, if you pay
not your vowes but deferre them, he that deferres
his vow, though the action be good in it selfe, yet
if the time be missed, he provokes <hi>God</hi> to anger,
and sinnes against him. It is a lawfull thing for vs,
to doe the workes of our Calling, and to do them
diligently, yet if we doe them vnseasonablie, and
incroach vpon the time allotted to prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we ought to renew our repentance, and to set
our hearts straight, and right before <hi>God,</hi> now it is
not done in season, it displeaseth <hi>God,</hi> it is an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
done out of its time. To mourne, and reioyce,
are both good actions, but if they be done out of
their season, they are both exceeding evill, and
sinfull: We see how carefully <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tels them,
they should not haue mourned; for (sayth he,)
this is a time of reioycing, for this time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
(it is your strength) <hi>for the ioy of the Lord

not, butreioyce. Againe, at another time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
is as great a sinne, as then to mourne, as we

Such times and seasons are to be observed, such
opportunities there be. There is an opportunitie
of preventing a mischiefe to a Common-wealth,
or to a Kingdome, when we neglect that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie,
it causeth <hi>the miserie of man to be great vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

There is a time, and a season, and an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
of comforting the bowels of the Saints,
of relieuing and entertaining strangers, of doing
good to parents, of educating, and bringing to
<hi>God</hi> children and servants, such as are committed
to our charge; This is but a short time, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie,
which when it is past, can be recalled
no more. The missing of these times and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
is that which <hi>causeth the miserie of man to

because men did not such, and such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               <p>There is a time when <hi>God</hi> offers grace to a man.

               <p>The time of a mans health, and of his peace, of
his life, quiet, and rest, is the time of making sure

there be.</p>
               <p>You shall see an example of them in <hi>Saul,</hi> and
in the people of <hi>Israell; Saul</hi> had a time to make
sure the Kingdome to himselfe, and the Kingdome
of heaven to himselfe; but because he lost his time,
<hi>God</hi> would giue him no more, he had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
no longer; but it was cut off from him. You
know he lost the Kingdome, by not staying the
time that <hi>Samuel</hi> appointed him, he stayed to the
very point of the time; but he stayed it not out.
The seaventh day <hi>Samuel</hi> came according to his
promise; but he thought he would not haue come,
because he stayed so late, but this was the losse of

the Kingdome to him. <hi>God</hi> intimates thus much
to him there, that if he had discerned his time,
he might haue saved his Kingdome, but because
he did not see it, that miserie came vpon him, he
lost the Kingdome from himselfe, and from his

               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> likewise; there was a time when <hi>God</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> I will run through some directions ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
briefly: Consider, what the cause is, that men
misse of their time, and you shall finde by that the
meanes how to finde it out. The cause why men
misse, it is</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The causes of missing the time.</note> Inability to discerne, man himselfe knowes
it not, and no man else can tell it him. So then it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

is in <hi>Gods</hi> owne power to reveale it. Therefore to
find out this time, let a man doe these two things,
to haue abilitie to discerne the times.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Directions to finde it.</note> let him not leane to his owne wisedome,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but trust in <hi>God;</hi> that is, let him goe and aske

Cases goe to <hi>God,</hi> shall I doe such a thing, or shall

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ning is
this, let a man in his heart rest vpon <hi>God,</hi> and trust
in him, and say thus to him, <hi>Lord,</hi> I confesse, I
know not the times, I know not whether this be
a fit season, or another, <hi>Lord,</hi> I leane on thee, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee discover the times to me. When the
heart indeede rests on him, there is a promise,
<hi>trust in the Lord with all thine heart,</hi>(that is) <hi>trust
in him in good earnest, and he shall direct thy way:</hi>
That is, there shall be a secret guidance from his
spirit, that shall pitch thee vpon a right time;
There shall a secret thought come in thy heart,
(which shall be as if a man stood behinde thee,)
that shall whisper to thee, and say, <hi>this is the way,</hi>
this is the time, turne this way, and not that; So
<hi>God</hi> directs vs, if we trust in him, and rest on him;
If we goe to him, and pray him, and beseech him
to guide vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is not enough onely to pray to
him, but there is another thing added to it, to

                  <hi>walke in his wayes,</hi> not to steppe out of his wayes,
but to keepe the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, when we haue

not out to any inordinate course, but keepe the

and the Iudgement; for to every purpose there is a
time and a Iudgement.</hi> You see, though it be very

nor can any tell him, yet this promise is made, <hi>he

               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved,</hi> it is a sure rule; If we be obedient to

               <p>A second Cause why men misse of these times,<note place="margin">2. Cause.</note>
that <hi>God</hi> hath allotted to every action,<note place="margin">Of missing the time.</note> &amp; purpose,
is, some passion, and distemper, to which they are
subject; for passion, causeth indiscretion, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course of things; you see, passion makes a
man misse of his time, it makes a man doe things
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2062:311"/>
vnseasonablie; whereas were the heart quiet, the
judgement would be cleare too, to see what were
fit and what vnfit.</p>
               <p>As it is in the common Converse with men;
So it is in these great actions, to choose the time
that <hi>God</hi> hath allotted to every action, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If there be any carnall, worldly, sinfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
in the heart, you are apt to misse of the
time; for every passion and distemper is like
drunkennesse, it casts a man asleepe. Now, he that

you misse of the times, why that <hi>great day</hi> comes
vpon you vnawares, why you doe not that dutie
as you ought within the compasse of the time
that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed; it comes from hence,
some excesse in the vse of lawfull Comforts: So
you haue two Causes given there,</p>
               <p>Either, when men inebriate themselues too

when they ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eede in them, when they take more
then they ought, though the things in themselues
be lawfull.</p>
               <p>Or secondly; They take so much care for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, that it breeds a distemper in them; that
is, it distracts their mindes; for by that a man may
know when his cares are inordinate, when they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2062:312"/>
breede distractions in the mind; as we see in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha;
Christ</hi> found not fault, because shee was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to provide; but because her care went to farre,
that it troubled her, that she could not attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
spirituall duties, there was the fault, <hi>Marthaes
thoughts were troubled about many things,</hi> when such
distempers grow on vs, it causeth vs to misse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the

If we would know the times allotted vs, take h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, to doe impertinent things, is that which
causeth men to misse the time that is allotted to

is occupied about things that he ought not, he

is this; The reason why men misse their
times that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed them, is, because
men are too intent vpon impertinent things,
which interrupts their care to serue the LORD.
And therefore we are to passe by them, and not
to put our full intention to every worldly busines,
