            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yes verily, it is full of Popish errours, and doth appoint horrible blasphemies, and lying fables to bee read to the people, in stead of Gods holy word, and hath caused the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to groane under the abominations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even from the infancie of it, in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, untill this houre; and now there is great hope, that a time of refreshing and deliverance is at hand, through the blessing of God, on this Parliament.</p>

               <p>On the first of <hi>October</hi> an other lying fable is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read, how <hi>Tobie</hi> being about to send his sonne <hi>Tobias</hi> to <hi>Rages</hi> in <hi>Media</hi> for a wife, did bid him go and look for a man to goe with him, &amp; that he went &amp; found an Angell, &amp; brought him to his Father, who promised to give the Angell wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and agreed with him what hee should have by the day, and sent him with his sonne and his dog.</p>

               <p>The interrupting of the Minister by the Clarke, and the whole Congregation, is a foule errour, and such an errour and confusion, as doth much offend God; and that therefore many are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come into the Church, till the Service be all read.</p>

               <p>By rehearsing his words with a lowd voice, and by taking words out of his mouth, and by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their prayers with his. The Minister when he prayeth, is the mouth of the people, speaking to God for them: therefore they ought to be silent, till he hath done speaking, and then to say <hi>Amen.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. and not to interrupt him by rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing every word after him, as in the Confession of sinne, when the Minister saith, Almightie and most mercifull Father, we have erred and strayed out of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62:5"/>
thy wayes, like lost sheepe: and in the <hi>Letany,</hi> when he saith, O God the Father of heaven, have mercy upon us miserable sinners; the Minister must stop, and be silent, till the Clarke and people, have with a lowd voice rehearsed every word after him; in which time, it is impossible for the Minister to keepe idle and by-thoughts, from comming into his minde.</p>
               <p>Also, when he prayeth for the King, saying, <hi>Lord save the King,</hi> they interrupt him, by mingling their prayer with his, saying, <hi>And mercifully heare us when we call upon thee.</hi> The Minister being interrupted and put out, in praying for the King, doth pray for Ministers, saying, <hi>Indue thy Ministers with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi>; they doe then also interrupt him, by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their prayer with his, saying, <hi>And make thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen people joyfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Throughout the whole <hi>Letany</hi> they do interrupt him by mingling their prayers with his. They doe also, without any warrant from God, but from Pope <hi>Hormisda,</hi> interrupt the Minister, when he readeth the Psalmes, by taking every other verse out of his mouth, to reade it for him with a loud, hackering and confused noise, especially in Countrey Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where the people cannot reade well.</p>
               <p>The Minister when he readeth or preacheth Gods word, is the mouth of God, speaking to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore they ought to be silent, and to hearken with reverence.</p>
               <p>When they reade the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth verses of the fiftie Psalme, they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by some to women scoulding and accusing one <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62:6"/>
another. The Clarke and people doe beginne to scould with, and to accuse the Minister, saying, <hi>When thou sawest a theefe, thou consentedst unto him, and hast been partaker with adulterers</hi>; then the Priest accuseth the Clarke, saying, <hi>Thou hast let thy tongue speake wickednesse, and with thy tongue thou hast set forth deceit</hi>; then the Clarke and people doe set upon the Minister againe, and doe accuse him, saying, <hi>Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother, yea, thou hast slaundered thine owne Mothers sonne.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> were the Leviticall Priests, whose office was to offer Sacrifices, which together with the Sacrifices was abolished in Christ his death.</p>

               <p>The name Priest, belongeth to every Christian man and woman, as well as to the Minister, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is written, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.6. that <hi>Christ hath made us Kings and Priests unto God:</hi> the meaning is that Christ hath made all the Elect, (men and women) Priests, to offer the Sacrifices of praise, and of thankes unto God.</p>

               <p>They finde fault with the Popish errours that are in them, as in the first prayer before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, it is written, that God hath sanctified the floud <hi>Iorden,</hi> and all other waters, to the mysticall washing away of sinne. The truth is, that there is no mysticall washing away of sinne in water, but a reall and true washing away of sinne in the blood of Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. The water in Baptisme doth but signifie, that as foule things are washed and made cleane in water, so the soules of the Elect, defiled with sinne, are made cleane in the blood of Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>In another prayer, the Minister prayeth that the Infant may receive remission of sinnes, by spirituall regeneration. The truth is, that the children of God have their sinnes forgiven, and are sanctified by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. and not by spirituall regeneration, which is but an effect of faith, purifying the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. or to speake more plainly, it is God that justifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. by accepting of the sufferings and obedience of Christ, as a sufficient recompence and satisfaction, and doth by faith assure the hearts of his children, that for the merits of the sufferings and obedience of Christ, his wrath is pacified, and his Justice satisfied.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>They say, that it is full of Popish errours, as first in the Rubrick before the Catechisme, it is written, that Children baptized, have all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, and are undoubtedly saved. The truth is, that they have no knowledge of sinne, nor of the wrath and curse of God due to sinne, nor of Christ, nor of the Articles of the Christian faith, and therefore have neither faith nor repentance, without which none can be saved. It is true, that Infants, borne of the Elect, are undoubtedly saved, by vertue of Gods everlasting covenant of grace, so many as are of the number of the Elect, I say, so many as are of the number of the Elect, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Elect, that are now Saints in heaven, have brought forth children that are Reprobates and damned soules in hell: For, <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi> as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>Ishmaell</hi> as well as <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> had <hi>Esau,</hi> whom God hated, as well as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> whom God loved.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>This errour, you say, is in the Rubrick, what errour is in the Catechisme?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>In the Catechisme, it is affirmed, that Christ
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62:10"/>
hath redeemed all mankinde. The truth is, that Christ came into the world, not to redeem all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, but the Elect onely; therefore the Evangelist S. <hi>Luke</hi> setting forth the genealogie of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth from <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and ascendeth to <hi>Adam,</hi> and from <hi>Adam</hi> doth descend to <hi>Sheth,</hi> who was the first of the Elect that was borne after the death of <hi>Abell,</hi> and maketh no mention of <hi>Cain,</hi> nor of any of his posteritie. And S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> beginning from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and from <hi>Abraham</hi> descendeth to <hi>Isaac,</hi> and from <hi>Isaac</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and maketh no mention of <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maell,</hi> nor of <hi>Esau,</hi> nor of any that came of them.</p>
               <p>Also our Saviour Christ saith, that <hi>he gave his life a ransome for many,</hi> Mat. 20.28. and that <hi>his blood was shed for many,</hi> Mat. 26.28. He doth not say, that his blood was shed for all mankinde, but <hi>for many,</hi> that is, for the Elect onely, who are many, though but few in comparison of the multitude that are Reprobates.</p>
               <p>It is also affirmed in the Catechisme, that we are made the children of God in Baptisme.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that whosoever is not a childe of God, before he be baptised, shall never be a childe of God, because all that are the children of God, were (before the world was) made the children of God, by vertue of Gods eternall decree of election. It also affirmeth, that there are two Sacraments ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally as necessary to salvation; intimating that the Sacraments are necessary to salvation, so as if a child die before he be baptised, he shall be damned, which is the cause that Midwifes doe take upon them to baptize. Intimating also, that there are more Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62:10"/>
then two; therefore it is written in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before the Communion, that every Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shall communicate thrice in the yeare, and also receive the Sacraments; meaning the five Popish Sacraments: For there are none other.</p>
               <p>It affirmeth also, that Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doe promise and vow three things, first, that the Infant shall forsake the devill and all his works, the pompes and vanities of the wicked world, and all the sinfull lusts of the flesh; secondly, that he shall beleeve all the Articles of the Christian faith; thirdly, that he shall keepe Gods holy will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and walke in the same all the dayes of his life, which no man is able to doe of himselfe.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that the Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doe neither promise nor vow, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant shall doe these things.</p>

               <p>By loosing and binding on earth and in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is meant the authoritie and power that Christ gave to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the rest of the Apostles, and to every faithfull Preacher, (not to forgive sinnes) but to declare and pronounce forgivenesse of sinnes to all that by their preaching shall be brought to true faith and repentance; and that as verily as forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, is declared and pronounced, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, to them that doe truly repent and beleeve in Christ, so verily doth God, of his free mercy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them their sinnes, for Christ his sake, and that as verily, as the wrath and judgements of God, are threatned to come on them that will not repent and beleeve in Christ; so verily, the wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God shall come upon them.</p>

               <p>It is indeed, a most devillish order, and sheweth plainly, that if some of them might have their wills, they would forbid men to read the holy Scriptures at home in their houses, as in Churches they forbid the Genealogie of Christ, the Booke of Canticles, both the Bookes of Kings (save the eight first Chapters of the first Booke of Kings) and of Chronicles, and the Booke of Revelation, save some few pieces, that are appointed to be read for Epistles after the Popish manner.</p>

               <p>They have no warrant for it from God, but from the Pope, who saith, that ignorance is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of devotion: therefore the Genealogy of Christ is forbidden to be read, of purpose to keep the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in blindnesse, not able to see the truth of God, in fulfilling his promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>David,</hi> that Christ should come of them, and of their seede, nor to see that Christ came not onely of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> who were Jewes, but also of <hi>Rahab,</hi> and of <hi>Ruth,</hi> who were Gentiles, and that therefore Christ, is not a Saviour of the Jewes onely, but also of us Gentiles.</p>

time, after the death of <hi>Constantine,</hi> grow idle and proud; especially, one of them, on whom <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> had bestowed great revenues, which made him so proud and stout, as he did overtop all the other Bishops, not onely in Rome, but also throughout the whole Empire, and did alter, chop, and change, and adde his owne devises to the publick worship and service of God, and did make Canons for the establishing, and putting of his devises in practice, and through the power of Satan, by false doctrines, signes, and lying wonders, did seduce the Christian Emperours that succeeded <hi>Constantine,</hi> and drew them to acknowledge him the head of the Church, and vicar of Christ, which made him so proud and potent, as he did subdue and bring under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and tooke upon him to excommunicate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of them, and to curse them, with bell, booke, and candle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henricus</hi> the Emperour, being excommunicated, came in submissive manner to be absolved, and (in the cold winter, in frost and snow) did waite at the Bishops gate, with his wife and childe, barefoot and bareleg, three dayes and three nights, before he could have audience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Emperour, was made to hold his stirrop, and to lie downe on the ground for him to tread on his necke; and at length, the Bishop of Rome came to be the great red Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. and with his long taile of false doctrine, flattery, promises, and preferments, did draw the third part of the starres of heaven, that is, so many of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops, as were not sound in heart, and did

               <p>When Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crowne, few or none did study Divinity in the Universities, therefore Tradesmen (such as were of honest life and conversation) were made Ministers to read Service, and in stead of Preaching, to read Homilies, till the Lord Jesus (in his good time) did thrust forth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his harvest, out of the Universities, who did discover the Popish errours, wherewith the Service Booke was pestered, and the unlawfulnesse of the Romish Ceremonies. Then the Lord Bishops (who till then were quiet) did bestirre themselves to disturbe the peace of the Church, and to bring in a cursed division; according to the words of our Saviour Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.51. <hi>Thinke you that I came to give peace on earth?

now, when humble Petitions were made for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Lord Bishops onely, and such as were seduced by them, and made to beleeve that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were lawfull, and that there was nothing in the Service Booke contrary to Gods Word, did bend all their forces against Reformation.</p>
               <p>In the latter end of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reigne, when shee began to be sickly, and not like to live long, then Doctor <hi>Bancroft</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> knowing that King <hi>Iames</hi> was to succeed her, and fearing that his Majesty would reforme things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in the publick worship and service of God, and in the government of the Church, did License a Booke written by a Jesuite that he kept in his house, wherein it was written, <hi>that it was in the Popes power, as a gift appropriate to Saint</hi> Peters <hi>chaire, to depose the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>and to give authoritie to the people to elect, choose, and set up another.</hi>

               <p>On the 21. of <hi>October</hi> 1638. in service time, was heard a fearefull Thunder, much like the noise or report of great Cannons, and a most strange and fearefull darknesse, and a strong loathsome smell of brimstone; and a fearefull blast, that strucke in at the North side of the Tower; and tearing through a strong stone wall, came into the Church, through the highest Window, and tooke with it a great part thereof; and with a mighty power strucke against the North-side wall of the Church, and did batter and shake it very much; and went towards the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and in the way tooke with it the Lime and Sand from the wall, and grated the wall, and defaced it, being newly whited; and tore away the side Deske of the Pulpit; and coloured the Pulpit blacke, and left it moyst, as if it had beene newly wiped over with Inke.</p>
               <p>There was also a most fearefull Lightning, which did affright the people, and scalded them so, as the most part of them fell downe, some on their knees, some on their faces, and some one upon another crying.</p>

               <p>A man sitting on the Church Beere, at the lower end of the Church, had the Beere torne in pieces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and himselfe throwne into a seat by the wall and had no hurt.</p>
               <p>A beame broke in the middle, and fell betweene the Minister and the Clarke, and hurt neither.</p>
               <p>The Church was very much defaced, and torne, and a great stone neare the foundation, was torne out and removed.</p>
               <p>Stones were throwne out of the Tower, as thicke as if there had bin an hundred men throwing them, some of such weight and bignesse, as no man was able to lift.</p>
               <p>One of the Pinnacles of the Tower was throwne downe into the Church.</p>
               <p>A very great stone was thrown from the Tower, over the East end of the Church, and over the Churchyard, and over an hedge into a Close.</p>
               <p>Another great stone was throwne an hundred yards from the Church, which sunke into the Earth so farre as it could not be seene.</p>
               <p>A Bowling-Alley neare the Church-yard, was turned up into pits and holes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62:19"/>A Wine-Taverne neare the Church, had the side next the Church torne up, and the covering carryed off; and one of the Rafters broke into the house.</p>
               <p>A little before night, some were sent into the Church to fetch out the dead bodies, who found a couple of little children, walking chearefully, hand in hand, and seemed by their countenances, that they had been nothing affrighted with the fearefull sights that they saw, nor with the lamentable crying of the people, nor to have cryed because their mothers were gone.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Whitsunday</hi> last, 1640. in the Parish of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> in <hi>Cornwell,</hi> when the people were kneeling at the Communion, great claps of Thunder was heard, as though divers Cannons had been shot off at once; and extraordinary and most fearfull flashes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and a terrible and unspeakeable strange sound, to the great amazement of the people; and when the Minister was turning towards the Communion Table to give the Cup, after he had given the Bread, he saw (to his thinking) a flaming fire about his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and withall, heard a terrible and unspeakeable sound, and had no hurt, save that the outside of one of his legs was scalded.</p>
               <p>Presently after that, diverse balls of fire came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and strucke one <hi>Ferdinando Reepe</hi> on the sole of his left foot, with such violence, as he thought his foot had beene split in pieces, and was for a while deprived of his sences.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Iohn Hodge</hi> was stricken in the knees, and thighs, and lower part of his body, so as he thought every part of his body to be unjoyned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62:20"/>One <hi>Dorothy Tubbe</hi> was stricken so, as she thought her legs and knees were strucke off from her body.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Anthony Peeke</hi> was fearefully struck in all the lower parts of his body, so as it seemed as dead; and felt the water in his bladder, as it were boyling hot, and thought that he had beene shot thorow, and was lift up from kneeling, and set upon the form by which he kneeled.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Susan Collins</hi> was struck in the lower part of her body, so as it seemed to her, to be struck off from the upper part, and was scalded on the wrest on the right hand.</p>
               <p>A great fire, farre redder then any Lightning came into the Church, and struck one <hi>Nicholas Shelton</hi> on both sides of his head, as though he had been struck with two flat stones, &amp; did shake his body as though it would shake it in pieces, whereby he lost his sight and his sences.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Roger Nile,</hi> was strucke on the back-bone, on the right side, and on the anckle on the inside of his left legge; so as for a while he was not able to stand.</p>
               <p>After the fire there was heard in the Church, as it were the hissing of a great shot; and after that a noise, as though diverse Cannons had been shot off at once, to make one single and terrible report.</p>
               <p>The noyse did not descend from above, but was heard and seemed to begin close at the Northside of the Communion Table.</p>
               <p>After this fire and noyse, then followed a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some smell of Gunpowder, and Brimstone, and a great smoake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62:20"/>The Church had no harme, save that seven or eight holes and rents were made in the wall of the Steeple, some on the inside, and some on the outside, and impressions on the stones in diverse places, as if they were made by force of shot, discharged out of a great Ordnance, so as in diverse places, light might be seene through the walls.</p>
               <p>In this storme was no body kill'd, save one dog in the Belfree, and another at the feet of one kneeling to receive the Cup.</p>
               <p>As soone as this fearefull storme was over, they that were weake, not able to stand, were (through the mercy of God) restored to their strength; and they that were franticke, to their sences; and he that was blind, was restored to his sight; and came all to the Lords Table, and received the Wine, and went all safe home, praising God; and returned all in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, to give God thanks.</p>
               <p>Besides, the fearefull signes of Gods wrath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Churches, diverse strange and fearefull sights have beene seene in the Ayre, and on the Land.</p>
               <p>The like we read were seene in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries beyond the Sea, a little before their warres and ruine began: Therefore pray heartily for the King and his Councell, and for the whole House of Parliament, that all may joyne together in the feare of God, to reforme what is amisse, especially, in Gods Worship and Service, and that in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wrath of God be kindled.</p>

               <p>When they saw that the chiefe of the Priests, and of the people, did bring the abominations of the heathen into the publick worship and service of God, and so polluted the house of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.14. they did not refraine, but came and brought their Sacrifices, and did mourne and cry unto God against those abominations; so doe you come and offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God your sacrifices, of prayer, of praise, and of thankesgiving, and mourne, when you see the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and people, doe after the abominations of the Church of Rome, and cry unto God against those abominations.</p>
