            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that Christ toke bread and blessed it, or that he
blessed the bread which he hade taken.</p>
                  <p>Therfore it semeth more that he blessed his dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples

it semeth more that he blessed his disciples, and
also hys apostels, in whome the breade of lyfe
was lefte more then in materiall breade, for the

Also Christe saythe in the gospell, verely verely

menne maye see by the wordes of Chryste that
it behoued that he dyed in the fleshe, and that
in hys deathe was made the frute of euerlastin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
lyfe for all them that beleue on hym, as it is

Christ shall al lyue &amp; euery man in hys owne or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
for as one clerenes is in the sonne, another

For ye say that in euery hoost either pece is the

thy face not parted. So ye saye the lordes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye

to begyle an innocente foole, but wyll ye take



<pb facs="tcp:22451:10"/>
hede of thys subtyll question, howe a man may
take a glasse and beholde the verye lyckenes of
hys owne face and yet is it not hys face, but
the lyckenes of hys face, for and it were his ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry

the glasse were broken in many places, so there
shulde be manye faces, more by the glasse then
by the body and eche man shall make as many
faces to them as they wolde, but as ye may see
the mynde or lykenes of youre face and is not
the verye face, but the fygure thereof. So the
breade is the fygure or mynde of Chrystes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye

as ye do thys thynge do it in mynde of me, Lu.

For he sayeth, whom ye haue not ye loue, in to

Luke sayeth .xxii. that Chryst toke the cuppe af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter

that shalbe shedde into the remission of synnes
for man, now what say ye, the cuppe which he
sayde is the new testament in my blode, was it
a materiall cuppe in which the wine was that
he gaue hys dysciples wyne of, or was it hys
moost, blessed bodye in which the blessed blood
was kept tyl it were shed out for the synnes of
them that shulde be made safe by his passyon,
nedes we must saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he spake of his holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
as he dyd whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called hys passion eyther
suffrynge in bodye a cuppe when he prayed to
hys father or he wente to his passion. Math.
xxvi. And sayd yf it be possible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this cup passe

be done. He spake not here of the materiall cup
in which he had gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys discyples drynke for
it troubled not him, but he praied for his great
suffrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; bitter the which he suffred for oure
synnes &amp; not for his. And yf he spake of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
body &amp; passyon when he sayd. This cup is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
newe testament in my blood, so he spake of his
holy bodye, when he sayd this is my body that
shalbe gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you, &amp; not of the material bread
whiche he had in his hande. Also in another
place he calleth his passyon a cuppe, Math. xx.
where the mother of zebedeus sonnes came to
hym, &amp; axed of hym that her two sonnes when
he came to his kyngdome myght syt one of his
ryght syde &amp; one at his left syde. And he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
&amp; sayd, woman thou wotest not what thou
axest, then he sayde to them, may ye drynke of
the cup that I shal drynke, &amp; they sayd yea lord
And he sayd ye shall drynke of my cuppe, but to
syt on my ryght hande or lefte hande it is not
myne to gyue, but to the father it is proper but



<pb facs="tcp:22451:12"/>
in that that he sayde ye shall drynke of my cup,
he promysed them to suffre tribulacion of this
world as he dyd, by the which they shuld enter
into lyfe euerlastyng, &amp; to be both on his ryght
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de And thus ye may se y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chryste spake not of
the material cup neyther of hym self nor of his

wordes of god &amp; holy scryptures, but many of
you be lyke the mother of zebedeus sonnes, to
whom chryst sayd, thou wotest not what thou
axest. So many of you wote not what ye axe
or what ye do, for yf ye dyd, ye wolde not blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
god as ye do, to set an alie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sted of
the lyuynge god. Also Chryst sayeth Iohn. xv.
I am a very vyne / wherfore worshyppe ye not
the vyne for god, as ye do the breade. wherein
was Chryst a verye vyne / or where in was the
breade chrystes bodye, in fyguratyue speache,
whiche is hyd in the vnderstandyng of synners
Then yf Chryste became not a material either
an early vyne, neyther materiall vyne became
the bodye of Chryste. So neyther the bread ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teriall
breade was not chaunged from his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce
to the flesshe and blode of Chryste.</p>
                  <p>Haue ye not reade Iohn the .ii. when Chryste
came into the temple, they axed of hym what

hereof they accused hym at his passyon ful fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
Math. xxvi. for he spake of the temple of
