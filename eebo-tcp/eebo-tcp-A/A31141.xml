            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN Act was paſſed to charge 2 <hi>s. per annum</hi> Duty to the King upon every <hi>Fire-hearth</hi> and <hi>Stove;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">14 Car. 2.</note> In which Act it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, That the ſame ſhould not extend to charge any Blowing-Houſe, and Stamp-Furnace, or Kiln, nor any other Houſe wherein there are but Two Chimneys, and for which the Rent paid is not above 20 <hi>s.</hi> yearly.</p>
            <p>Upon former complaint made to the Parliament, by the Black-Smiths, of ſeveral Abuſes committed in the Collecting of Hearth-Money.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Smiths Petition was committed to the Committee of Grievances; <note place="margin">Nov. 6. 1667.</note> Which Committee ſeveral times met, and Voted all the Matters complained of to be Grievances: And amongſt many other things, They</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved;</hi> That no private Oven, no Still, no Smiths-Forge or Blowing-Houſe, no Furnace, no places in Kitchins for keeping Diſhes warm, or Stewing; no Lead or Copper, nor any place uſed onely for conveighing the Smoke, or for receving the Coles drawn out of the ſaid Ovens or Furnaces from under the ſaid Leads or Coppers, and not uſed as a Hearth for any other intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ought by any of the ſaid Acts of Parliament to be charged as Fire-Hearths, and be lyable to the ſaid Duty.</p>
            <p>And that the beſt way to remedy the ſaid Inconveniences, would be a New Bill.</p>
            <p>The Committee made part of their Report to the Houſe, <note place="margin">Dec. 7. 1667.</note> and the Houſe agreed all their Reſolves to the 12th to be Grievances.</p>
            <p>The Houſe proceeding to take into further conſideration the Committees Report concerning Hearth-Money, <note place="margin">Decemb. 10. 1667.</note> and all Reſolves from the 11th, with the Opinion of the Committee being read the ſecond time, were, upon the Queſtion, ſeverally agreed unto by the Houſe to be Grievances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved;</hi> That a Bill be brought in for the Redreſſing the Grievances and Abuſes in Collecting of Hearth-Money, and for the better aſcertaining the Duty upon the ſeveral Heads, and the Opinion of the Committee in their Report being all agreed to by the Houſe, it was referred to the ſame Committee to prepare and bring in a Bill accordingly.</p>
            <p>Accordingly a Bill was brought in, and twice read, and committed, but the Houſe was Prorogued before the Committee could come to make their Report.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the poor People in the ſeveral Counties in <hi>England</hi> did think themſelves ſecure in theſe Votes and Reſolves of the Houſe, and accordingly were quiet in the Countrey for ſome years after, but are now diſturbed in moſt places of <hi>England:</hi> To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance all would be long, therefore ſhall inſiſt only upon one Place, whoſe Caſe is the ſame with all others of their Trades in other parts of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Hallamſhire</hi> there are above One Thouſand Cutlers, Sciſer-Smiths, Shere-Smiths, Sickle-Smiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at <hi>Brimmingham</hi> are Sword-Smiths, Cutlers, Spurriers, Bridle-Bit-Makers, Naylers, and divers other Handicrafts Men who live by Manufacturing of Iron and Steel, are very Poor, have numerous Families, moſt of them Working at 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 8 <hi>d.</hi> a day Wages, cannot make any Work without Blowing, and therefore muſt have Blowing-Forges in their Houſes, (as well as Thouſands of others in other parts of <hi>England;</hi>) ſome of them (though the pooreſt Men of all) have Two or Three.</p>
            <p>Theſe moſt of them live in poor Cottages, wherein there are not above two Chimneys apeece, and for which there is not above 20 <hi>s. per annum</hi> Rent paid.</p>
            <p>For ſeveral years after the Act, and Additional and Explanatory Acts, and Votes and Reſolves aforeſaid concerning the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hearth-Money paſſed, there was no demand made of theſe poor People of any Duty for their Forges.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Collectors of the Chimney-Money have made Demands upon all thoſe poor People of 2 <hi>s.</hi> a Forge, (which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt the Letter of the Acts and Votes aforeſaid) and for non-payment have made Diſtreſſes, taken away their Goods, to their great prejudice, whereby they are diſcouraged from continuing to work any longer. And which is moſt ſevere, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſtrain upon their Working-Tools, which for want of Money they cannot ſometimes redeem in four or five days; all which time they ſtand ſtill, and muſt loſe the getting much more than might have paid the Duty demanded.</p>
            <p>Several have had Tryals at the Aſſizes concerning this Demand, been put to vaſt Charges, and upon the Tryals ſpecial Verdicts being found, the Perſons have attended many years in <hi>London</hi> to have got them Argued, but cannot obtain the ſame, which is their further Grievance; inaſmuch as their Journeys, Expences in attending, and loſs of their Time and Work by ſuch delayes, tend to their and their Families ruine.</p>
            <p>If theſe Forges be made lyable, then the Caſe will be ſad to the Poor, who were (as appears by the Act) intended to be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (having not above two Chimneys apeece in their Houſes, and not paying above 20 <hi>s.</hi> a year Rent) for if they ſhall be judged as Hearths, then having two Chimneys, and moſt of them two or three of theſe Blowing-Forges, they will be brought by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to pay 6, 8, or 10 ſhillings <hi>per annum</hi> to the King for a Houſe of 20 <hi>s.</hi> a year Rent, which they humbly conceive was not the Intention of the Parliament, their Act being expreſly to the contrary; And if it be not ſo, will tend to the Ruine of thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and thereby many thouſands of his Majeſties poor Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore</hi> they moſt humbly pray the favour of this Honourable Houſe to declare their Intentions in this Matter, that they may be diſcharged from any further Attendance upon the Court of Kings Bench for Arguing the ſaid ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verdict, and not be diſturbed upon this Account for the future.</p>
