            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Nder the name of <hi>Sprirituall Treasure,</hi> behold the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> which I here present thee, Devout Reader. It hath taken the name of <hi>Treasure,</hi> because it contains, as in a hidden mine, the highest <hi>divine truths</hi> of <hi>Christian Piety</hi>; it is a Pourtract of <hi>Perfection,</hi> the Image of a <hi>true Christian,</hi> or all which the Sonne of God hath left to his Church. And those which I propose to you in this <hi>Treasure,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a lively Image of that <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> whereto we are called, and, by the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> conducted. Perhaps you may remember that this Book hath heretofore appeared under the same name, but it was upon another design. For then it treated onely of some particular <hi>Vertues,</hi> such onely as serve to subject the <hi>soul</hi> to the <hi>guidance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It had then no other object, but the resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature to the will and
<pb facs="tcp:29616:4"/>
work of the <hi>Creator.</hi> Now it is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, and withdrawn from a limited subject, speaks in generall, explains the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the principall <hi>Vertues</hi> necessary for a <hi>perfect Christian.</hi> As for the stile, it is concise, confining it self to the truth which it exposes the most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that may be, despising all <hi>Ornaments</hi> of words, since <hi>truth</hi> hath so much lustre of it self, as she need not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of others. The World perhaps will not <hi>hearken</hi> to it, or, suffering it to speak, will not understand it, for its <hi>Doctrine</hi> is too <hi>divine,</hi> its <hi>Principles</hi> too high: That which it proposes is wholly contrary to what the World professeth. And it is much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that many will dispute it, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>falsehood</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> have taken such deep root in the greater part, as loving nothing but <hi>vanity,</hi> and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to consent to <hi>truth.</hi> We live in an age so corrupt, that even <hi>Christians</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fear to be good, least they
<pb facs="tcp:29616:4"/>
should be persecuted, and are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to appear <hi>vertuous,</hi> least they should be derided.</p>
            <p>Hardly can it promise it self a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>reception</hi> amongst them that make <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> for there are many that seek nothing but their own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the most holy things; self-love hath such absolute power over <hi>souls,</hi> that they flatter themselves in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, believing all to be good which is agreeable to them: and on the other side, seeming <hi>Devotions,</hi> have so much applause among men, that it will be hard to perswade the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that our <hi>perfect Christian</hi> who speaks here purely of <hi>Truth,</hi> and truly of <hi>Piety,</hi> cannot easily avoid the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>censures</hi> of men. For as he speaks <hi>Christianly</hi> (for his stile is in the <hi>spirit</hi>) so he condemns freely all that is not worthy of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi>; which may appear strange, and those who confide too much in themselves, esteeming nothing but
<pb facs="tcp:29616:5"/>
their own <hi>actions,</hi> will soon <hi>condemn</hi> this manner of Discourse. But what remedy? shall we therefore injure <hi>Truth?</hi> no, she will appear before the eyes of men, in despight of the <hi>World,</hi> and although she may meet with <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> little <hi>capable</hi> to receive her, yet it is alwayes good to expose the <hi>Image</hi> to the view even of her greatest <hi>Enemies,</hi> for by this meanes they will be forced, seeing her, to confess they have no <hi>vertue,</hi> that they walk in the <hi>night</hi> of <hi>untruths,</hi> and perhaps they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend their own <hi>misery,</hi> and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to loose themselves.</p>
            <p>And if there are any who think themselves already arrived at the highest point of <hi>perfection,</hi> flattering themselves in their own esteem, when they shall here consider the <hi>excellencies</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and admire the <hi>designs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon <hi>souls,</hi> and see what is necessary for a <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> they will open those <hi>eyes</hi> which <hi>self-love</hi> had bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:29616:5"/>
and acknowledge that their <hi>actions</hi> come far short of their own esteem of them; and then humbling themselves even to the centre of their nothing: they will resolve to seek God, to serve him in <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner worthy of God.</p>
            <p>However they who take the paines to read this little work will see, that many deceive themselves to their great mischeif, and will learn that it is not a small matter to gain Heaven (for to such only is Paradise open) and that there is required more purity and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue then we ordinarily propose. For if the life of a true Christian be a life of God in man; if true perfection be an amorous possession of God, what purity, what vertue must there be in him who will possesse so rich a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp; pretend to an estate of divine?</p>
            <p>This is a point you must consider of (friendly Reader) as being that which ought to be the only object of your actions. For if you will open your
<pb facs="tcp:29616:6"/>
eyes to see what God requires of you; if you will rest your thoughts upon the excellencies of the state of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, you will learn that your heart must be the Throne of the most holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> who will establish his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> therein; your <hi>Soul</hi> a <hi>Heaven</hi> where <hi>God</hi> will glorifie himself; your <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>God</hi> who lives in you, that you may raign with him. To conclude, you shall know that you are onely in the <hi>World</hi> to please <hi>God,</hi> and to do his will in the purity of his spirit alwayes holy: is not this an affaire of great importance? If for your satisfaction and profit you desire to comprehend what I say, and to know the <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>obligations</hi> that you have to love and serve <hi>God</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Read the two first parts of this <hi>Work</hi>; the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> shew you the way you must keep, and the <hi>Truths</hi> that are necessary to live a good <hi>Christian</hi>: the <hi>last</hi> gives you a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of true <hi>piety.</hi> Read and you shall learn how to be a good <hi>Christian.</hi>

                     <hi>even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> These are holy words, words of truth, pronunced by the Holy of holies, the God of Truth; words that import the beginning and eminency of the estate which we are to attain; words worthy to be engraved not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29616:13"/>
upon the fronts of our house as a celebrious Sentence of the Ancients; nor printed in our foreheads, in great Characters, like the Law of the <hi>Iews,</hi> But in the centre of our souls, and bottom of our spirits. For in these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine words, we behold as in a table brought from heaven, what we are, and what we ought to be. We see that we are the image of God by creation, and ought to be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance by sanctification. Our soul bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the image of God, is capable of God himself, and hath an essence so noble and divine, that nothing can satisfie, nothing can fill her but an infinite essence. Besides, we learn that our soul being called to the resemblance of God, nothing can ennoble her, nothing can perfect her, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and very perfections of the Divinity. And to this it is that Jesus Christ invites us, when he says, <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> This only is the subject of this little Work. I would to God, that they who are transported with the wonders in Nature, who can admire her greatness, rare varieties and perfections, who willingly confine themselves to the contemplation of the motions of the heavens, of the extent of the earth, of the depth of the sea, of the admirable secret properties of every thing, would turn back their sight into themselves,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29616:13"/>
to take notice what they are, and what they ought to be, to contemplate the singular perfection inclosed within their own souls, the greatness whereto God will raise them, and eminency of that state to which they are called.</p>
                  <p>If other Creatures are objects able to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish our spirits, and oblige them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and admiration, with how much more reason ought we to employ our selves in the consideration of our own soul, for which all things were created! If vertue, saith <hi>Plato,</hi> be so beautifull, as that her luster is able to transform our hearts, and force us to love her, what then is the soul, of which vertue is but the ornament? O soul, saith one of the Fathers, thou lovest the world, yet thou thy self art of more value then all the world! Thou admirest the Sun, and yet art more beautifull then all the Stars; Thou dost contemplate heaven, yet art exalted above the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thy God onely is above thee, all creatures are under thy feet; Let us begin to prepare our hearts to these thoughts; let us call back our distracted spirits from so many objects; let us withdraw our wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes from so many curiosities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive our hearts charmed by so many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that we may apply or selves to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29616:14"/>
of this knowledge, for in being ignorant of these truths, man is estranged from God and himself, serves the creatures who were made to serve him, makes his vanity an ornament, and advances above himself, that which ought to be under his feet, and farther loosing himself in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pursuit of creatures or pernicious affection to the world, he no more thinks of himself, and, which is worse, seems no longer to know his God. Hence spring all evils which overflow the earth, all vices and disorders in the life of man. Nor is it strange; for how can a Christian serve his God, if he esteem not his greatness, and be ignorant of his divine adorable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and how shall he know them, if he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or never consider them? Beside, how is it possible for a Christian to render unto God what he ought, and to live as God requires, if he take no time to reflect upon himself; if he know not what he is, whence he comes, whither he goes, how he lives? In this it is he ought to employ his thoughts and time. The highest employment of man, says <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> is to seek himself; and we say, the most necessary; yet we are not with <hi>Democritus</hi> to put out our eyes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our selves of the sight of all creatures, thereby with more ease and attention to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29616:14"/>
apply our selves to the study of this high philosophy, the knowledge of God, and our selves; we need not go to such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. On the contrary, let us preserve our eyes and attention to contemplate at leisure the image which I am going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto you. It is the pourtracture of a true Christian, in which shall be drawn in lively colours the Christian vertues, and represented the dispositions, actions, and piety, wherein all Christians ought to live.</p>
                  <p>To speak after this manner is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to this subject. He that would make a man to see what he ought to be, must draw his picture, that he may see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template himself therein. The soul like the eye sees all things, yet not it self unlesse by reflection. To make her know her selfe, a glasse must be set before her, wherein are represented the true beauties of the state of grace, the excellencies of Christianity, her obligation to perfection, her capacity to possesse God; that, considering all these, she may see what she is, and what she ought to be to her God.</p>
                  <p>Thus seeing her selfe, she knows her self, knowing her helf, she esteems accordingly of her own being, life, and condition, and by these degrees, arriving to this esteem, she
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29616:15"/>
faithfully endeavours to render God the honour, love, and service due to him, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to lead a life suitable to the condition and dignity whereto God hath called her.</p>
                  <p>To represent to the life so great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to acknowlege what the soul is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to whom she is called, and may arrive by the assistance of a supernaturall power; We must consider the essence and grace of the Mysteries wrought by the Son of God upon the Earth, and what he hath accomplished in Heaven, because they are the beginning and source of all <hi>Graces</hi> wherewith we are inriched; they make us know what God requires of us, what he will operate in us and by us. These then we must propose. Behold three which we must make choice of, including all the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Christianity; whatsoever is to be said of the rest, is to be deduced from these.</p>
                  <p>The first estate wherein we are establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the grace of Christianity, is that which we receive in Baptism, where we are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the most holy Trinity. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this estate consists herein, that the most holy Trinity by this Sacrament of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, giving us at once a new being, and a new birth, it sanctifies and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates us by an Unction altogether extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29616:15"/>
and divine, and by this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary consecration draws us from our selves, separates us from the common Tempests of the world, to dedicate and refer us wholly to his honour and glory, to call us to a holy conversation which we ought to have with divine persons, as the beloved Apostle saith, <hi>That our fellowship may be with the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and with his Son Iesus Christ</hi>; that by this society we may become worthy and capable of the effects of grace and divine communications to be with God, and possessed of God. That which makes this favour most admirable, is, that the most holy Trinity doth vouchsafe to apply it selfe to the accomplishment of this work in a very particular manner; it sanctifies and consecrates us, not after that ordinary way wherewith it acts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all other works common to the three Persons; but in this work of grace and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of life, it consecrates us in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly singular, and full of mysteries, altogether great, and full of love. The Father sanctifies us, giving us his Son; the Son becomes incarnate, suffers, and riseth again for us; the holy Ghost works in us <hi>Iustification,</hi> infusing into us the abundance of those <hi>Graces</hi> the Son merited for us. Thus the three <hi>Persons</hi> by distinct operations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to every person, effects in us this work
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29616:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of graces and love in this manner. Thus the most holy <hi>Trinity</hi> applies it selfe wholly to us after an extraordinary manner, and proper to this Sacrament, to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate us to their glory and honour, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration so high and mysterious, that it contains all the Truths of Faith, whence the Fathers call <hi>Baptisme</hi> the <hi>Sacrament of Faith.</hi> This is the first dignity whereto the Christian soul is advanced, but this is not all. Let us go on and penetrate further into this mystery of Love, and we shall see that this consecration (O miracle of the infinite bounty of God!) places us in God, and is the cause of Gods being in us, not after the manner that he is in all other things, nor by any gift or created grace, but after a wholly extraordinary way, which gives him to us, and causes him to dwell in us. Here God doth disclose his heart to us; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shews and gives us his Son; the Sonne gives and applies himselfe to us in the Spirit, and in the grace of his Mysteries, and both together making one profusion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of their love, send and give us the holy spirit. Thus the three divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons dwell in us, consecrate us, and fill us with their presence and abundance of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That which is admirable in the excesse of this divine Love, making this grace and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29616:16"/>
estate singularly eminent, is, that there is not any other <hi>Creature,</hi> not the <hi>Angels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are advanced to this Dignity; it is reserved only for <hi>Christians</hi> who are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the most <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> after so holy and mysticall a manner. It would require a large <hi>Discourse,</hi> to teach us to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend such rare advantages; but let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves to consider: first, that all <hi>creatures</hi> are referred to God, but a <hi>Christian</hi> not onely referred, but consecrated; as if you should say, that he belongs more to God, and is more holy then all other <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> O how beautifull is this truth, worthy to make us lift up our hearts to God!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we know that both <hi>Angels</hi> and men in the state of Innocency, were reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the graces and gifts of God; but the <hi>Christian,</hi> in the state of Christianity, is not onely filled with divine gifts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but with the most holy <hi>Trinity</hi> it self, which dwels in him, and consecrates him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner we have declared.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all <hi>creatures,</hi> even <hi>Angels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, behold God in some of his divine qualities, as the <hi>Seraphins</hi> in his love, the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> in his knowledge, the <hi>Thrones</hi> in his stability, and so the rest; but the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> by a happy advantage, beholds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to him in the extent of all his greatness,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29616:17"/>
not onely as <hi>Creator,</hi> but as <hi>Father, Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier</hi>; not only as God considered in his Nature and divine Essence, common to the three Persons, but by a happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection he distinctly beholds the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, and refers himself to God as the Father, as the Son, and as the holy Ghost. Thus by one speciall and singular Grace communicated to him in Baptisme, he is consecrated to the most holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and made the <hi>Temple, Throne,</hi> and <hi>Residence</hi> of the ineffable, immense, and adorable <hi>Trinity.</hi> What can be more said?</p>

                  <p>WE cannot say too much upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> which contains so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the soul, and such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favors of God; and when we have said all we can, we must acknowledge it is far short of the <hi>Subject.</hi> We know that God works great matters in the souls of his Elect; that his love, mercies, and divine liberality, are as incomprehensible as ineffable, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, what can be added to the love that God expresses to the world in the mysterie of the Incarnation? What more can be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29616:17"/>
hoped? If according to the mysteries of our Faith we believe God gave his Son to the world, making him like unto us, to make himself more capable of being mercifull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; we cannot doubt, but that the same God of love will shew himself bountifull in all things else, since he hath made such an extraordinary communication of his love, and of himself in thus giving us his Son, it cannot seem strange, if now after so divine a gift, he bestow on us his graces to exalt us to so holy a being; an estate which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates us to make us capable of possessing God. Nothing is impossible to him that can do all things: we ought onely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a perfect knowledge of the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and a disposition to receive all that God will give us. It were to be wished, that all <hi>Christians</hi> did follow the light of Faith as they are obliged, that being guided and illuminated by this heavenly <hi>Pharos,</hi> they might know the dignity and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of these mysteries, that knowing them, they might adhere to them; that adhering to them, they might become capable of that grace which they include and God will communicate to us, that we may thereby profit as Christ wills, who offers his gifts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring we should receive and use them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his intentions. This counsell we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29616:18"/>
ought to follow in all these mysteries. Let us begin by him, and examine what it is that God demands of us for the benefit of this regeneration &amp; Baptism. Being consecrated to God by Baptism after so divine a manner, we are no more now our own, but belong wholly to him, nor ought we to make use of our selves but for him. If any profane thing being offered to God, consecrated by ceremonies, or dedicated to celebration of the divine office, is by this means abstracted from common use, and its particular end to be wholly employed in sacred things; much more a <hi>Christian</hi> consecrated to the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> by Baptisme, solemnly dedicated to Gods service, and referred to his glory, ought to be withdrawn from himself, and such profane customs as of himself he may commit in his life and actions, to be referred in whatsoever he doth to the service and glory of God.</p>
                  <p>From these proposed <hi>Truths</hi> it followeth, that the grace of <hi>Christianity</hi> communicated by Baptisme, whereto we have right by this Sacrament doth advance man above all <hi>creatures,</hi> and withdraw him from this world, to associate with God, and to become his <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Throne</hi> of rest; that being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from care and love of the creature, he may cleave to God only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:29616:18"/>The soul may be compared to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>cloathed with the Sun, and having the Moon under her feet,</hi> to tell us that our soules being replenished with the true <hi>sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi> ought to raise themselves above all Creatures, and possessing God, contemn all that is not God, of God, or for God. The learned <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> sayes, <hi>That we ought to esteem, as beyond and above the world, all that is consecrated to God</hi>; meaning only those, who by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and ancient Customs of the Church resign themselves to Gods service. If this be true in bare <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> how much more is he whom God himself consecrates in this Sacrament beyond the world, and above all things. This is the effect of the words of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> when speaking of the spirit of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity which he had infused into his <hi>Apostles,</hi> he says, recommending them, and with them all the Elect unto his Father;<note place="margin">John 15.19. Joh. 7.16.</note> 
                     <hi>The world hates you because you are not of the world, I likewise am not of the world;</hi> where we see evidently, that according to the designs of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> a Christian must be no longer of <hi>this world,</hi> nor pretend further to the creature then the Son of God did, when he became man, and liv'd upon earth. We learn further, that by this consecration, and the state whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are advanc'd by <hi>Baptism,</hi> God assumes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29616:19"/>
a second interest in us, besides that of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in complyance with this new right, we ought to be more his, and live onely for him. For he hath right to make in us, and of us all that he pleases for his glory, and the accomplishment of his divine will. I need give no other reason hereof then that of the Apostle, <hi>Know yee not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghost,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>which is in you, which ye have of God. And ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider deliberately this Christian truth, weigh all these words, and ye shall see how much ye belong to God, and ought to live for God. Reject not this as a matter new, or too high; it much imports to your good. If you cannot comprehend it, at least admire it; and since they are truths, you ought to believe them; by Faith you shall enter into an estimate of your estate, and acknowledg it is so divine and eminent, that you cannot comprehend it, but can onely say that he that is all power will effect great things in you. Now if you will endeavour to profit by these proposed verities; First, take heed you commit no sacriledge in serving any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but God, since ye are consecrated for his glory; be careful to refer your self unto him, and to offer to him all your actions, be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29616:19"/>
they never so little, for they all belong unto him, and he knoweth how from the lowest, meanest things to bring honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing God hath separated you from the world, consecrating you for his glory, and that, by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> solemnly in the face of the Church, you have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all its greatnesse, and varieties, Take heed you deceive not God, or rather your selves, adhering to the creature, sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after, and following the <hi>Vanities</hi> of the <hi>Time;</hi> but see that in pursuit of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you have made to God, you do disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle your selfe all the days of your life, as much as you can possible from these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take your <hi>affections</hi> off from them: and if you will do well, despise them all for God, that your heart, consecrated by an <hi>Vnction</hi> so holy, may be only for God, and love none but God. The best founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Piety</hi> is to enter into a great esteem of God, and what you are unto him, so to contemn the world and all therein.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Seeing you have no right to your selfe, being marked with the character of Gods substance (so Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the love of God) and are wholly his, let him make use of what is his; go out of your self,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29616:20"/>
go out of your own Interest to God, aim at nothing but the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and therein place your principall care; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more important in the life of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> nothing more profitable or necessary then to leave wholly himself to God, and to search diligently after God only.

                  <p>THe mystery of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> a work of <hi>Love,</hi> and the <hi>Master-piece</hi> of God, ought to be considered as the foundation of all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Life of the Sonne of God. From this they have their dignity and excellency; from this they flow as from their source and principle; this we ought to look upon, and adore as the Cause of all our happinesse, for in and by it we have all that we can-desire; all the greatnesse, all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29616:20"/>
the priviledges and abundance of grace communicated to us in the state of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> flows from this ineffable Mystery as its spring. It requires an eternity to consider so worthy an object, to look into the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and to contemplate the effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>Let us here make a pause to consider this grace the most advantageous of all we have received from the Son of God in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, which gives us right and admission to all the rest, the grace of <hi>Filiation,</hi> which makes us children of God by adoption, a grace given to men, when the Son of God becoming man, made men the sons of God. By this benefit we are no longer the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> but of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is <hi>God,</hi> called by the Prophets, <hi>The everlasting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> By this <hi>grace Christians</hi> have a new being, a new life, which honoureth and imitates the new life of <hi>Iesus</hi> in his holy humanity, springing from this as its source and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For as the word unites it self to our nature in the Mystery of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenisheth and dwells in it as in his proper body, consecrates and elevates it to all the <hi>Grandeurs</hi> of his divine <hi>Filiation</hi>; so the same <hi>Iesus</hi> unites himself, not personally, but by a new Grace, and after a singular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, proper to the state of <hi>Christianity,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29616:21"/>
us, dwels in us, and advanceth us to the communication of the rights, goods, and greatnesse of his <hi>filiation,</hi> and would have us (<hi>O excesse of love!</hi>) to be that by <hi>grace</hi> which he is by <hi>nature,</hi> which he would have not onely to be accomplished in <hi>glory,</hi> but in <hi>grace,</hi> not onely in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but upon <hi>Earth,</hi> where we are truly <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and in that quality henceforward, we enter into alliance with him, we have right to his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: and, which is more (<hi>O that we would consider it!</hi>) he gives us power to call God our Father, to look up to him as such, to relate to him in this quality, in further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof he gives us his spirit. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15, 16.</note> when he saith, <hi>Ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Father, the same spirit it selfe beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with our spirit that we are the children of God.</hi> It is an effect of the mystery of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> and priviledge and excellency of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Let us deliberate further upon it. St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> summing up the graces received from God, in the Mystery of the <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ranks this the first, for it is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rest, saying, <hi>To them he gave power to become sons of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jo. 1.12.</note> If you would compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend some part of this great favour, think that as there is nothing in Divinity greater then to be the Son of <hi>God</hi> by Nature, so (<hi>but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29616:21"/>
to be God himselfe</hi>) nothing is greater then to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> by grace. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring in God the title of Father, sayes, <hi>It is an ineffable name containing the Mysteries and Secrets hid from our spirits, incomprehensible by our understanding.</hi> If then to be Father in the Deity be a thing the most mysterious and ineffable that our souls can imagine; by consequence, to be son of such a Father is a favour and dignity incomprehensible. The beloved Disciple causeth us to admire at this great benefit, when he says, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>that we should be called the sons of God,</hi> and be such in effect. St. <hi>Iohn Damascene</hi> speaks to this purpose, <hi>That the eternall Father sent his Son into the world to produce Children that should be such to him by Grace, as Christ is unto him by Nature;</hi> and therefore in pursuit of this Commission, the Son of God, from the time that he became the son of man, hath created by his power, begotten by his love, and acquired by his merits, and given by his Spirit, many children to his Father, who can breath nothing but <hi>glory</hi> to his Father, and no longer live, then by his Spirit and Life.</p>
                  <p>But to search with greater admiration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Truth,</hi> we must consider the manner by which he <hi>creates</hi> in us so <hi>divine a work.</hi> We
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29616:22"/>
must observe, that in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> we not only receive <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> by the habituall <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirt,</hi> but are also marked with the <hi>Character</hi> of God, received and owned as his children. The manner whereby God effects this is admirable; for as the Father hath sealed Jesus Christ with his Seal, and made him his Son, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to him his <hi>Essence,</hi> and making him altogether equall to himself; so Jesus Christ doth comunicate to us what he himself is, marketh us with his seal, makes us and owns us as children, and makes us as it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>himself. Wonder,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine, and rejoyce, brethren, we are made of Christ.</hi> In pursuite of this benefit, the eternall Father hath given us the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his Son, <hi>which dwels in us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> according to the <hi>Apostle.</hi> What can we think to be greater? If we go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herein, we shall find, that we are not advanced to this admirable estate of being the children of God by any simple accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by bare ceremonies, but by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more reall that passeth into our souls, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> implies, by these mysticall terms: <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>but according to his mercy he saved us. It is not for our works,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> that the spirit is given us by Jesus
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29616:22"/>
Christ, and that Jesus is sent upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign by the eternall Father, three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances worthy great consideration.</p>
                  <p>To conclude the greatness of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, let us observe with <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,</hi> that we are advanced to this divine estate by a <hi>new birth,</hi> and divine <hi>regeneration</hi>

Whence it follows, that the <hi>state</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> being a holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>estate,</hi> that makes him the Son of God, as truly by <hi>Grace,</hi> as Jesus Christ is by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> his actions also and life ought to be wholly divine, and conformable to the <hi>state</hi> of the Son of God.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then despise this heritage of <hi>Adam,</hi> and seek that of the children of God, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> or, to say better, <hi>God himself</hi>; Say with Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Joh 18.36.</note> with a sound heart, <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world.</hi> Remember that you must keep the rank of the Sons of God, as Princes of the Blood: And as the Princes of this world do maintain themselves in

God only is your heritage, undervalue not him for transitory vanities of this world; forsake him not for the whole world, unless you would be for ever miserable.

                  <p>The second benefit is a great desire of <hi>Paradise,</hi> sighing daily thousands of times after our <hi>heritage, Heaven,</hi> bewailing the want of, and demanding the liberty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and due to the children of God. In this thought of our <hi>Celestiall Sion,</hi> our sweet Countrey, we grieve to see our selves so long in a <hi>strange Land.</hi> It is hard to attend with so great impatience a happy day, a good hour, an honour which we are made to hope for; yet we are without sense in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, the true and <hi>ineffable</hi> joyes of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi> Great God! can it be that the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> should not cause us to loath the <hi>Onyons</hi> of <hi>AEgypt?</hi> How long, children of men, how long shall we have hearts of <hi>Adamant,</hi> insensible toward the things of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet open for the transitory goods of this cursed earth, to love lying, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                  <head>CHAP. V. What the Actions of Christians ought to be.</head>
                  <p>SEeing the state of <hi>Christianity</hi> is so <hi>eminent,</hi> that it advances the <hi>soul</hi> to a <hi>filiall being</hi> so <hi>divine,</hi> it follows that the <hi>actions</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to be eminently <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> This <hi>truth</hi> is proved not only by the common <hi>principles,</hi> that the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of every thing ought to be conformable to their <hi>being</hi>; but likewise by another <hi>maxime</hi> of Christianity, <hi>that a Christian</hi> receive all by Christ, and in Christ; and as the Apostle sayes,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> 
                     <hi>of him, and though him, and to him.</hi> In pursuit of this <hi>Principle,</hi> all the <hi>actions</hi> of a Christian ought to be done in the Spirit of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and in respect to God, which makes them <hi>high, perfect,</hi> and <hi>holy; High,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Christ its principle; <hi>Holy,</hi> as being wrought in <hi>him; perfect</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> as being wrought for <hi>him</hi>; such <hi>actions</hi> we truly call Christian.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>explicate</hi> this more particularly, we must observe, that a true Christian <hi>action</hi> must be done in <hi>grace,</hi> in the <hi>spirit,</hi> in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29616:26"/>
dispositions, wherewith <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>actions,</hi> during his wayfaring life, yet in a different way, for the <hi>son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> did act after a <hi>divine</hi> manner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the eminence of his <hi>estate.</hi> To work after this manner is proper only to <hi>him,</hi> to this we cannot arrive, neither must we aspire unto it, but we are obliged to act after a <hi>manner</hi> very near this, and the highest that can be, excepting this. For, the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> that we ought to observe in our <hi>actions</hi> springing from the <hi>son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> must by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence be very like it. So a <hi>Christian action</hi> should be that which is made in the <hi>spirit of God</hi> that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath borne upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> accomplished in the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> dispositions of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself. By this only Circumstance we may judge of the difference of our <hi>actions,</hi> for all that we do without the <hi>spirit,</hi> and without <hi>dispositions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to an <hi>action</hi> worthy of <hi>God,</hi> is to do nothing, or very little, such <hi>actions</hi> ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed but from a <hi>naturrll</hi> inclination, or, which is worse, from the instigation of our own <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of our selves. Let us farther consider this <hi>Truth,</hi> which will seem hard or new to those who know not the excellency of <hi>Christianity,</hi> who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the purposes of <hi>God,</hi> who are <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>mysteries</hi> of their <hi>salvation.</hi> When
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29616:26"/>
the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> are said to comprehend their <hi>perfection,</hi> you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> came into the <hi>world,</hi> not onely to communicate to us his <hi>grace,</hi> but to <hi>dwell</hi> in us, and <hi>give us</hi> his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> to give them to us, not onely to <hi>justifie</hi> us, and, as we say, to put us into the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> but to <hi>be</hi> in us, to <hi>dwell</hi> there, to <hi>be</hi> the beginning of a new <hi>life,</hi> and new <hi>spirit</hi> in us, and to <hi>give</hi> us dispositions proportionable to such an estate. This the <hi>Apostle</hi> teaches when he sayes, that the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father</hi> hath put the spirit of his Sonne into our <hi>hearts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.</note> and <hi>that the spirit it self beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God</hi>; whereby we see, that being <hi>justified</hi> by the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>filiation</hi> and <hi>divine adoption</hi> we live in the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit of God,</hi> which is made our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> which is in us, dwells in us, governs us, inlivens us, and is the Principle of our <hi>Actions,</hi> makes them pleasing to God, supernatural, and worthy of <hi>Paradise.</hi> Thus the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of God is far above all <hi>lives,</hi> a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> above all <hi>beings.</hi> I leave you to judge what the Actions of Christians ought to be, proceeding from a principle so <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will find all the very <hi>reasonable,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29616:27"/>
admire the <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> of God in this <hi>Conduct</hi> of our souls, if we will <hi>consider</hi> that the <hi>eternal word</hi> was made <hi>man,</hi> that by <hi>debasing</hi> himself, he might <hi>render</hi> to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> an honour worthy of God, he came upon the Earth to <hi>establish,</hi> by the <hi>merit</hi> and by the <hi>spirit</hi> of his Crosse, the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> God in our <hi>souls,</hi> and to make us worthy to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> God, after a manner worthy of God. For this cause he <hi>advances</hi> unto himself, he <hi>consecrates</hi> our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> by his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and that they may be referred worthily to the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> he <hi>unites</hi> himself to us, <hi>communicates</hi> to us his <hi>life,</hi> his <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> to make us capable to praise God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his greatness, which we could never do, if we did not take of him, and from him, this <hi>power</hi> and <hi>disposition.</hi> This he gives us when he dwells in us by the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>filiation</hi> and <hi>divine adoption,</hi> whereto we are advanced when we are made <hi>Christians.</hi> Hence we see, that <hi>Christian Actions</hi> ought to be <hi>holy, perfect,</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> that a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life</hi> ought to be the very life of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> living and working in him by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. His <hi>actions,</hi> his <hi>inward dispositions</hi> must be a lively image and perfect expression of the <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>holy intention</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, we think no more of these <hi>Truths; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:29616:27"/>
are become so blind, that we may well complain and say with the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, <hi>That the life of man is spent either in doing evil, or in doing nothing, or in doing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterously what he ought to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To undeceive our selves of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>abuses,</hi> to enter farther into the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the state of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and to see more <hi>evidently</hi> what we ought to be, let us further remember, that as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, we are members of the Sonne of God; he is our head, a head that infuses life in us. In this quality he hath right to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>act</hi> in us as our <hi>souls</hi> act and live in our <hi>bodies.</hi> This consider'd, we must say, that as the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> consisteth in his being a <hi>member</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so the <hi>perfection</hi> of Christian <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> is, that they are operated by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> living and operating in us as his <hi>members.</hi> I say not onely that we must <hi>imitate</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and do all our actions in <hi>Grace,</hi> that thereby they may be called Christian; but also, that they ought to be with the same <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> wherewith <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> did act on Earth, which he communicated to his Church, and to all his. Our Actions ought not only to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> but to be <hi>worthy</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> our <hi>head,</hi> whose <hi>members</hi> we are. Therefore they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29616:28"/>
must be <hi>animated</hi> by his life, guided by his <hi>motions,</hi> and regulated by his <hi>intentions,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to this end, he giveth us his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to be our spirit and life, and that he gives us freely abundant grace, in <hi>him</hi> and by <hi>him</hi> to accomplish all our actions. This is of great <hi>importance</hi>; for which we shall one day render a strict <hi>account,</hi> when God shall judge the uprightness of men by so extraordinary a favour. Certainly he will <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> the ignorance, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and abuse of so many <hi>graces,</hi> which he hath acquired for us by his <hi>travells</hi> and <hi>cross,</hi> and offereth us with so much <hi>love</hi> and <hi>bounty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will appear yet more <hi>evident,</hi> if we consider the common <hi>belief</hi> of all the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> who acknowledge that the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of a perfect Christian, ought to be <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> Let us therefore <hi>examine</hi> what the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of this <hi>grace</hi> is; for supposing that the <hi>life</hi> of a Christian is a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> we must necessarily grant, that our <hi>actions</hi> by consequence ought to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> and <hi>correspondent</hi> to the <hi>sanctity</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> which gives them <hi>life, sanctifies</hi> them, and <hi>advances</hi> them, since they must be proportionable and semblable to the <hi>cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We know that the <hi>grace</hi> which <hi>sanctifies</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:29616:28"/>
and gives <hi>life</hi> to our <hi>actions,</hi> is a <hi>grace</hi> made for the Son of God, that from him it <hi>flows</hi> into us, that we are not <hi>replenished</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched,</hi> but from his <hi>bounty.</hi> This granted, our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> must be <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> by the same <hi>sanctity</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> which is in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which is lovingly <hi>communicated</hi> to, and <hi>engrafted</hi> in our <hi>souls,</hi> sanctifying, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening and perfecting our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we say that this <hi>Grace</hi> comes from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> we express in this alone the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of it. For to know the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>eminency</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> it <hi>suffices</hi> not to say, as we commonly do, that it is <hi>supernaturall,</hi> because in it there is nothing <hi>singular.</hi> For the <hi>grace</hi> given to <hi>Angels</hi> and to <hi>man</hi> before his fall, was also <hi>supernatural.</hi> We must say, that the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> is a grace made for the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and consequently worthy of the greatness of the <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> of the incarnate word; this makes it <hi>the raiser of an Order,</hi> and gives it a <hi>being</hi> much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the first, and from the order meerly <hi>supernaturall.</hi> This gives it a <hi>being</hi> and <hi>order</hi> as different from the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> as they are from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the sonne from the servant. Now applying what we have said, that <hi>Actions</hi> ought to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29616:29"/>
                     <hi>conformable</hi> to their <hi>Principle,</hi> we conclude that the <hi>actions</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> being sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enlivened by the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> ought also to be wholly <hi>conformable</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; their principle being more then <hi>humane,</hi> more then <hi>angelicall,</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>sanctity</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> of the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> worthy the Labours of his <hi>Crosse</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> To this end, St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth, <hi>that ye walk worthy of the vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith ye are called;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.1.</note> words that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be considered, since that God will demand an <hi>account</hi> of us of his <hi>favours</hi> and <hi>benefits,</hi> and will judge our <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>lives,</hi> according to the <hi>dignity</hi> of our <hi>vocation</hi>; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>sanctity</hi> of his <hi>Grace,</hi> in brief, according to the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which alone ought to be the rule and Law of <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore we must consider the <hi>rule</hi> of God over our <hi>Soules,</hi> wherin we may <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> the wayes and meanes, whereby the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> bounty, and infinite wisdome of God, uses to <hi>give</hi> us graces, necessary to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish our <hi>actions,</hi> in that <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> that he requires. I intend not to speak of the secret and unknowne means, of the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inspirations, motions,</hi> and speedy <hi>succours</hi> wherewith God is pleased to illuminate our <hi>Spirits,</hi> to enflame our <hi>wills,</hi> and to direct all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29616:29"/>
the motions and <hi>actions</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi> But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire only to insist upon the <hi>consideration</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> that the sonne of God hath left in his Church, as channells by which he continually powers out this <hi>grace</hi> into us. <hi>Baptisme</hi> consecrates us to the most holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> makes us the <hi>children</hi> of God, members of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Temples of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and holy Vessells which bear <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who dwells in us.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Eucharist</hi> (which is among the <hi>Sacraments</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> among the <hi>Stars</hi>) gives God to us, and with him all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>heaven,</hi> elevates us and unites us, to God, changes and makes us little gods; What would ye more? Why is God think you so profuse of his <hi>gifts,</hi> of his <hi>graces,</hi> of <hi>himself,</hi> but to operate in you all that I have said, to give you a <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>being</hi> whereto he hath <hi>elected</hi> you?

of the happiness of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise it.</p>
                  <p>To awaken and draw us forth of this <hi>darkness,</hi> consider that <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us, that the <hi>happiness</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> consists in <hi>seeing</hi> themselves to be in the <hi>company</hi> of God, and the greatest <hi>recompense</hi> God promises to our <hi>travels,</hi> is to make us <hi>partakers</hi> of his <hi>glory,</hi> to <hi>raise</hi> us to his <hi>greatness,</hi> to <hi>enter</hi> into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>communion</hi> with us.<note place="margin">Jo. 17.24.</note> 
                     <hi>I will,</hi> saith <hi>Christ</hi> to his Father, <hi>that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am</hi>; implying the <hi>socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> of God with us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, that <hi>eternity</hi> shall never separate him from him that <hi>serves</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the <hi>happiness</hi> of the blessed in their <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> consists in the <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity</hi> of God, we cannot doubt but the <hi>happiness</hi> of the <hi>just</hi> upon <hi>earth</hi> consists in <hi>knowing</hi> how to <hi>preserve</hi> themselves in this <hi>desireable familiarity</hi> and <hi>presence</hi> of God: The <hi>intent</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God at his coming into the <hi>world,</hi> and becoming an <hi>Inhabitant</hi> thereof, was, to <hi>sanctifie it</hi> by his <hi>presence,</hi> and <hi>establish</hi> his <hi>power</hi> therein, and <hi>dwell with us to the end of the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 28.30.</note> as he promised at his death. This is it that he wrought by the <hi>mysterie</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> making himself <hi>man,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> among <hi>men:</hi> For this <hi>cause</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> he becomes

                  <p>Let us consider these two <hi>mysteries</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love, mysteries</hi> which give <hi>God</hi> to us, and cause us to <hi>dwell with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last is the <hi>mysterie</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> a <hi>mysterie</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> an <hi>eternall mysterie</hi>; for God shall be <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> God for ever; a <hi>mysterie</hi> causing God to <hi>live</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of man, and man the <hi>life</hi> of God, which between God and man, effects an <hi>union</hi> and <hi>society</hi> so <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>intimate,</hi> that he could not do any thing more <hi>holy,</hi> nor desire any more <hi>intimate,</hi> since it is <hi>substantiall</hi> and <hi>personall,</hi> and shall subsist <hi>eternally.</hi> Entring further into the consideration of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> we shall see evident <hi>signs</hi> of this <hi>holy Communion.</hi> God makes here a new <hi>World</hi> (as the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> calls it) a <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> a <hi>World</hi> which he governs by a new <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> and <hi>providence.</hi> For whereas before <hi>God</hi> confining himself within himself, spoke not to the <hi>World,</hi> but by his <hi>Prophets;</hi> now by the accomplishment of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> he comes out of himself, <hi>speaks</hi> to us, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs</hi> us by his Sonne.

he guided the <hi>World</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> onely by his Angels the <hi>Interpreters</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> of his <hi>divine will.</hi> Now <hi>Iesus</hi> guides his <hi>Church</hi> by himself, he infuses holy motions into our <hi>souls,</hi> by his <hi>spirit,</hi> (alwayes holy) he governs all, is present with all, and is found by all. What <hi>presence</hi> or <hi>commerce</hi> with God would you desire greater? what greater <hi>society</hi> then that of the <hi>word,</hi> by the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarnation?</hi> To know it more particularly, consider these <hi>Circumstances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> in this <hi>Mystery</hi> God lives the life of man, and man the life of <hi>God,</hi> a life of <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> a life <hi>humanely divine,</hi> and <hi>divinely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> for <hi>Iesus</hi> is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> in <hi>Iesus</hi> we adore and acknowledge two lives, one of <hi>God in man,</hi> another of <hi>man in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> by this ineffable <hi>union,</hi> God communicates himself to man, and by this communication appropriates to himself all that is of man with such wonderful <hi>wisdom,</hi> that, not <hi>dishonouring</hi> his <hi>divine greatness,</hi> he takes upon him all the <hi>lowness</hi> of man, and subjects himself so really to our <hi>infirmities,</hi> that we say God is dead, God is born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and man by a happy <hi>exchange</hi> is lifted up to all the <hi>greatness</hi> of God, inthron'd in the bosom of the eternal <hi>Father,</hi> where he <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> enjoyes the proper <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Let every tongue <hi>confess,</hi> that in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29616:32"/>
that <hi>hypostaticall union,</hi> accomplished in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarnation,</hi> man enjoyes the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>greatness, light,</hi> and <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for the life and <hi>divine myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the Sonne of God, we see he <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it to us the space of thirty three years, <hi>conversing</hi> with us as one of us; was an <hi>Infant</hi> in his first appearing, laboured in his <hi>youth,</hi> did live and eat with sinners in his <hi>wayfaring</hi> life. He disdained not to <hi>succour</hi> the <hi>infirm</hi> in his <hi>miraculous</hi> life. In a word, he resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself into the hands of sinners a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and was offered a <hi>holy offering</hi> on the <hi>Crosse,</hi> for the sins of the <hi>World,</hi> (O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full!) he died between two <hi>Thieves</hi> in the company of men, so much pleased with the <hi>society</hi> and <hi>commerce</hi> of men.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Religion</hi> ever had the <hi>presence</hi> of its God so visible? what <hi>being</hi> was ever <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced</hi> to so great an <hi>honour?</hi> To none but the <hi>Christian</hi> is this great favour granted, a <hi>Commerce</hi> so <hi>sacred,</hi> that it makes <hi>man, God,</hi> and <hi>God, man.</hi> By the ineffable <hi>mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarnation,</hi> God unites the <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth.</hi> The God of <hi>Heaven</hi> dwells upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                  <p>IN pursuit of these proposed <hi>Truths,</hi> what may we judge to be the <hi>intentions</hi> of God, but that his <hi>will</hi> is, that we should enter into a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> society with him, and that we should <hi>separate</hi> our selves from all that may <hi>hinder</hi> or <hi>prophane</hi> this <hi>holy conversation</hi> with him, since that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> thinks of us, converses with us by his <hi>divine mysteries,</hi> unites <hi>himself</hi> unto us, and abaseth <hi>himself</hi> to be as one of us, to be among us, we ought likewise to <hi>think</hi> of none but him, to <hi>love</hi> none but him, to <hi>converse</hi> with none but him, and like the Apostle, <hi>dwelling upon Earth to have our Conversation in Heaven.</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29616:33"/>
to be, saith, <hi>Christians are in the body, but they live not according to the body, they dwell upon the Earth, but their Conversation is in Heaven.</hi> This God requires of us, this we ought to be in the state of <hi>Christianity;</hi> this is the use we ought to make of the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> flowing from the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alass, it is pitty that <hi>Iesus</hi> being now <hi>revealed</hi> unto us, living with us and amongst us, we apply thereto so little of our selves, of our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and of our <hi>love,</hi> and busie our selves in <hi>things</hi> so <hi>small, prophane</hi> and <hi>mean,</hi> even such as are unworthy of man!

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, the state of the <hi>Grace</hi> of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> obliges us to be <hi>holy,</hi> seeing <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> with whom we converse is <hi>holy.</hi> The Apostle says,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15.</note>

                  <p>We see in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarnation,</hi> that the Sonne of God enters into <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>society</hi> with us, dwells with us, is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our <hi>humanity</hi>; God is made man, that man might be made God,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.1.

For as they are true <hi>Children</hi> of God by <hi>Grace,</hi> and as truly <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> by <hi>Grace</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> is by <hi>Nature,</hi> so they are Gods by <hi>Grace</hi> as <hi>Iesus</hi> is God by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And if there be any who find this <hi>Truth</hi> difficult, let him consider with St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> that it is no harder for God to make a man truly God by <hi>Grace,</hi> then it was for him to cause the Son of God to become tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man; neither is there less <hi>repugnance</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king man God by <hi>Grace,</hi> then in making God man by the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation.</hi> Since then by this <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> God is made man, why by an emanation of the same <hi>Mystery</hi> may not man be God? And as by this <hi>society, union</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> which the Sonne of God hath undertaken, the <hi>nature</hi> of man is the <hi>highest,</hi> most <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>greatest</hi> communication that God could give; so hath it <hi>effects</hi> wholly conformable to what it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29616:34"/>
is; for as the <hi>Mystery</hi> was onely operated for God's <hi>glory</hi> and mans <hi>advancement,</hi> so it produceth infallibly the <hi>effects</hi> of glorifying God in a manner <hi>worthy</hi> of God, seeing man, that is God adores God, and <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> men to such a <hi>dignity,</hi> as to be able to be <hi>Gods,</hi> and Children of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reflecting upon so <hi>eminent</hi> a <hi>truth,</hi> do we not see clearly, how <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> the life of a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be, being called to so high a <hi>dignity,</hi> a <hi>Prerogative</hi> onely proper to a <hi>Christian</hi>? if a <hi>Christian</hi> must with all his <hi>power</hi> lay hold of this <hi>estate</hi> whereto God hath advanced him, he ought also to have a <hi>particular care</hi> to become <hi>worthy</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>grace,</hi> and to dwell with <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in a great <hi>union</hi> and <hi>dependance,</hi> that he may receive of him all the <hi>effects</hi> of this divine <hi>Mystery,</hi> by whom all must <hi>operate</hi> in our <hi>souls,</hi> and he must particularly <hi>dispose</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly flow from this <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Communications</hi>; for on this fidelity of our souls, and on our <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the foundation of all <hi>Good</hi> we can hope for. And as all the <hi>happiness</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> consists in his being <hi>confirmed</hi> to his God, and <hi>dependant</hi> on him more then the beames on the Sun; so all the happiness of a <hi>Christian,</hi> is to be <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>united</hi> in a most

                     <hi>intimate</hi> society with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> from whom being <hi>separated,</hi> he becomes <hi>unworthy</hi> of the estate whereto God hath <hi>destin'd</hi> him, deprives himself of all <hi>good,</hi> and can hope for nothing lesse then a <hi>world</hi> of <hi>mischiefs.</hi> The greatest pain of the <hi>damned</hi> is to see themselves <hi>separated</hi> from God, <hi>banished</hi> his company for ever, and the happy <hi>communion</hi> of the Saints.

                  <p>NExt the ineffable <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> we have nothing more worthy consideration in <hi>Christianity,</hi> then the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in which God shewes the last touches of his <hi>love,</hi> and makes us most clearly see the <hi>designs</hi> he hath on our <hi>souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us, that by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist, Love</hi> transports <hi>Iesus,</hi> out of himself from the <hi>throne</hi> of his <hi>greatness</hi> to our <hi>baseness,</hi> causing him to <hi>live</hi> with us and in us, such is the purpose of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self said, as the <hi>institution</hi> of this <hi>divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> to establish between him and us, a mutuall <hi>cohabitation,</hi> that by this <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> he may enter into a true <hi>society</hi> with us, be <hi>united</hi> to us, and <hi>continue</hi> his life of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation among us men to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>He doth perform this <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>dwelling</hi> with us and in us, by this high <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:29616:36"/>
which according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is an <hi>imitation</hi> and <hi>extension</hi> of the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnacion</hi> to every <hi>Christian.</hi> This <hi>mysterie</hi> shews the <hi>commerce, communion</hi> and particular <hi>residence</hi> which God hath in every one of us: For as the <hi>communication</hi> which the Son of God hath made of himself to our <hi>nature</hi> united to his <hi>divine</hi> Person by the <hi>mysterie</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> is an <hi>imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>extension</hi> of the supreme <hi>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> adorable and sacred <hi>society</hi> in the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> among the Persons, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the most high and divine <hi>communication</hi> that God could do out of himself; so the <hi>Eucharist</hi> which is an <hi>extension</hi> of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in every one of us in the most divine and abundant <hi>communication</hi> that God can do in the order of <hi>grace</hi>: For <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in this ineffable <hi>sacrament,</hi> gives himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to every one of us, and advances us, and by his <hi>vertue,</hi> draws us wholly to him, by his power <hi>transforms</hi> us into his qualities, makes us <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>eternall</hi> like himself, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes his <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>dwelling</hi> in us by this divine <hi>mysterie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover by this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>union,</hi> God is <hi>present</hi> with us, is <hi>amongst</hi> us, and <hi>united</hi> to every one of us after a manner so <hi>admirable</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> that we being not able to give it a name, call it <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> as an Union
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29616:36"/>
wholly hid from our eyes, and covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadow of <hi>Faith,</hi> neverthelesse, a true <hi>Vnion,</hi> an <hi>Vnion</hi> that contains in it self, and settles in us the <hi>presence</hi> of God, makes us to be in God, and God in us. Thus God is altogether upon the <hi>earth</hi> in the midst of his <hi>People</hi> by the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and he is in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Angells</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> in the throne of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> filling at the same time both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> with his <hi>glory, presence,</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> Briefly this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> gives us God, causes us to live with him, and of him, puts us into a <hi>commerce</hi> and <hi>society</hi> with him, and that with so much <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> and <hi>advantage,</hi> as we say, that in this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fulnesse</hi> of God, we enjoy <hi>Iesus</hi> more happily and more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the <hi>world</hi> did heretofore in the time of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> during his mortall life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will more clearly demonstrate it, that we may the more <hi>esteem</hi> so great a <hi>benefit,</hi> and the excellency of the state of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> whereto we are called by the <hi>mercy</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> They who lived in the time that <hi>Iesus</hi> conversed visibly upon Earth, <hi>saw</hi> him, but did not <hi>enjoy</hi> him, few persons knew him; he was not then seen but in his <hi>lowness,</hi> as sayes the Apostle, <hi>in the likeness of sinfull
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29616:37"/>
flesh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> In the <hi>Eucharist</hi> we see him by <hi>Faith,</hi> a light as <hi>true</hi> and more <hi>infallible</hi> then that of the Sunne it self; we do adore him in his <hi>greatness,</hi> in the state of that <hi>glory</hi> which he hath in the bosom of his <hi>Father</hi>; we <hi>handle</hi> him, we <hi>touch</hi> him, we <hi>eat</hi> him. After this manner he is ours, he will have us to be his; he is in us and we in him, we <hi>live</hi> of him, and for him as he <hi>lives</hi> for us, and the <hi>life</hi> that he <hi>lives</hi> in us is so <hi>divine,</hi> that he composes it to the <hi>life</hi> that he leads in the bosom of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Now what more <hi>solid union,</hi> what more <hi>intimate society,</hi> what more <hi>divine commerce</hi> can be imagin'd, what <hi>greater</hi> can we require of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> During his life here, he <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>redeemed</hi> Man-kind, he <hi>dyed</hi> and <hi>merited</hi> for them, but he <hi>gave</hi> nothing, or if he gave it, was little in <hi>comparison</hi> of the liberal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions which he makes of himself in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable <hi>Sacrament, where he merits no more</hi> (for it is not the time) <hi>but gives himself to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and with himself all the treasures of grace and holiness.</hi> This is a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and <hi>communication,</hi> whereby the Sonne of God <hi>communicates</hi> to every one of us, a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>seed</hi> of <hi>glory.</hi> In a word, he <hi>communicates</hi> himself here as he <hi>communicates</hi> himself to the <hi>Saints</hi> in the state of <hi>Glory,</hi> yet after a different manner, and conformable
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29616:37"/>
to the diversity of the states of the <hi>Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant</hi> and <hi>Tryumphant.</hi> Add to this, that in the time of the <hi>Incarnation Iesus Christ</hi> was upon the earth, without <hi>power,</hi> covered with our <hi>infirmities,</hi> living in our <hi>weakness,</hi> subject to the empire of <hi>death.</hi> Now we <hi>possess</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> him in the bosom of his <hi>Father,</hi> in the extent of his <hi>power,</hi> having in his hand the <hi>conduct</hi> of Heaven and Earth. Then he was in the <hi>World</hi> in poverty and privation; but in this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>communication,</hi> he enjoyes the <hi>fulness</hi> of his <hi>greatness,</hi> and is onely here, that he may <hi>communicate</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here on earth during his <hi>morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> he was seen but <hi>sometimes,</hi> and that <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,</hi> for some saw him in his <hi>infancy</hi> and no more, others in his <hi>youth,</hi> some felt the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> in working of <hi>miracles,</hi> many were <hi>witnesses</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> All this past, and was seen but in a small part of the <hi>World,</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; all the rest of the <hi>World</hi> was in <hi>darkness,</hi> and saw not this <hi>beautiful Sun,</hi> nor enjoy'd this agreeable light. But in the <hi>Mystery</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist, Iesus</hi> as given to all the <hi>World,</hi> all the people of the <hi>Earth</hi> enjoy him from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>South</hi>; there is no Nation where the <hi>Christians</hi> possess not <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and in him all the <hi>estates</hi> and severall <hi>Mysteries</hi> of

his life, all that he is and shall be <hi>eternally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iesus</hi> in his life on <hi>Earth,</hi> was in the quality of a <hi>servant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20.28.</note> as he saith of himself, <hi>He came not into the World to be ministred unto, but to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi>; also he was subject to <hi>Angels,</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> even to the very <hi>devills,</hi> when he gave them power over his <hi>life,</hi> in the time of his <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> But in this <hi>divine Sacrament,</hi> he is as in his <hi>Empire,</hi> and in his <hi>Paradise</hi>; we there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him as our <hi>spouse,</hi> governing his <hi>Church,</hi> like the Sun enlightening our <hi>souls,</hi> like a <hi>Prince,</hi> establishing the Kingdom of his <hi>grace,</hi> and the power of God in our <hi>spirits,</hi> we there acknowledge him as a <hi>propitiation</hi> for humane kind, rendring to the eternal <hi>Father</hi> the honour that is due to him. In brief, in this <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> we behold <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as in the throne of his <hi>greatness,</hi> where he receives throughout the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>adoration</hi> of his <hi>people,</hi> and the <hi>duties</hi> of our <hi>souls.</hi> In this manner the <hi>Earth</hi> is made a <hi>Heaven,</hi> and we have our God with us and in us. Let us consider these <hi>truths,</hi> that so we may <hi>profit</hi> thereby, and let us see what this <hi>divine bounty</hi> will work in us, which makes such an abundant <hi>communication</hi> of it self in this <hi>Sacrament.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. The Design of Iesus Christ upon <hi>Christians</hi> in this most high Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHat think we God requires of us for so <hi>powerfull</hi> a <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Love?</hi> What design can he have upon <hi>Christians</hi> in so divine a <hi>communication,</hi> so generall a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion</hi> of his <hi>gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> he will <hi>change</hi> us, (a happy <hi>change</hi> for us) for he <hi>changeth</hi> us into himself, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saint <hi>Austin: I shall be changed into thee, but thou shalt not be changed into me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> he does thus <hi>change</hi> us, not so much by a <hi>gift,</hi> or created <hi>grace,</hi> as by his holy <hi>humanity,</hi> and the power of his <hi>divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Son of <hi>God,</hi> effecting this <hi>change</hi> out of the excess of <hi>love,</hi> make use of this <hi>means</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> himself to us, and to <hi>assume</hi> a new <hi>power</hi> over us, as of a thing that belongs to him. For having by his <hi>body</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>possession</hi> of our <hi>member</hi> as his, and made us <hi>members</hi> of his <hi>body, flesh</hi> of his <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>bone</hi> of his <hi>bone,</hi> by his <hi>divine sacrament</hi> of <hi>union, love,</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> he <hi>assumes power</hi> over us by a <hi>right</hi> to him for ever.</p>
                  <p>When we shall consider these three <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:29616:39"/>
what can we <hi>think</hi> or <hi>say,</hi> but that God will have us no longer men, but gods? He will have us to go out of our selves to be in him, and cease to be that which we are, to be what he is? O how <hi>great</hi> is this! How cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth the <hi>holiness</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> estate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? seeing then this benefit is so <hi>heavenly,</hi> and the <hi>communication</hi> so <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> in this ineffable <hi>sacrament,</hi> we are by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>obliged</hi> to make <hi>uses</hi> conformable to the <hi>thing</hi> it self, and to the <hi>designs</hi> of God, of which I shall propose some.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That your sole <hi>contentment</hi> be to be with God, who takes such <hi>pleasure</hi> to be with you; that all things be <hi>unsavory</hi> to you, that all the <hi>pleasures</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> be contrary to your <hi>heart</hi>; renounce all <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>vanity.</hi> Let even your smallest <hi>entertainments</hi> and ordinary <hi>actions</hi> be in him, who is in the bottom of your <hi>heart,</hi> who testifies such a singular <hi>love</hi> unto you. This <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> will not be <hi>difficult,</hi> if you be truly disposed to <hi>vertue</hi>; for being <hi>vertuous</hi> it will be hard to take <hi>recreation</hi> in any <hi>created</hi> thing, not in the least unprofitable <hi>word,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a <hi>perfect Christian</hi> takes no pleasure but in God, and that which is of God, for being a <hi>member</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as such he is to act <hi>holily,</hi> he must live of the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> no way <hi>recreate</hi> himself but in him, and in <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:29616:39"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Recollect and form often in your <hi>soul</hi> a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>continuall</hi> desire that <hi>God</hi> be in you all that he ought to be, and that you <hi>cease</hi> to be all that you are. Have a <hi>great desire</hi> to <hi>loose</hi> your self, and to <hi>go out</hi> of your self, and that your being be <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> and <hi>consummated</hi> in that of <hi>Iesus,</hi> who is in you. This is the <hi>point</hi> whereto you must <hi>arrive,</hi> if you will that <hi>God</hi> should <hi>possess</hi> you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdy,</hi> Desire and require, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> destroy in you, all that is <hi>contrary</hi> to God, that he establish in you the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God; that he take from you the <hi>dominion</hi> which <hi>self-love,</hi> the <hi>vanity</hi> of your <hi>nature,</hi> and your <hi>inclination</hi> usurp over you and the <hi>creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Resign your self to the will of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who by this adorable <hi>sacrament</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> will receive you into himself, and place you in his <hi>life</hi> and his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Abandon then your <hi>self</hi> to the <hi>desire</hi> that he hath to <hi>possess</hi> you, a <hi>desire</hi> as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> as the <hi>Love</hi> wherewith he gives <hi>himself</hi> to you is <hi>infinite.</hi> Pray him to destroy in this <hi>present life</hi> the <hi>being</hi> that you use and abuse, that by the power of his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and by the <hi>vertue</hi> of this ineffable <hi>sacrament</hi> he may make you what he is, that is to say, <hi>Love, Life,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> Behold what God
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29616:40"/>
requires of you; if we regard <hi>intentively</hi> the <hi>essence</hi> and the <hi>excellency</hi> of this <hi>mysterie,</hi> if by the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> we weigh the <hi>effects</hi> it <hi>produces</hi> in us, it will be easie to <hi>acknowledge</hi> them, and soon shall we be constrained to <hi>confess</hi> that this <hi>sacrament</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> doth <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate</hi> us wholly to God, <hi>draws</hi> us from our <hi>selves</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>separates</hi> us from the <hi>commerce</hi> of <hi>creatures,</hi> that we may be <hi>knit</hi> in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising</hi> all things for his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>glory;</hi> so shall be verified the <hi>word</hi> of the Son of God to his <hi>Father</hi> in the excess of his <hi>Love,</hi> speaking to him not onely of his <hi>Apostles,</hi> but of all good <hi>Christians; They are not of the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jo. 17.14.</note> 
                     <hi>even as I am not of the world.</hi> This is the spirit of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the excellency of this <hi>divine</hi> estate.</p>
                  <p>That we may the better remember, this you shall see in a little <hi>Picture: First,</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> consecrates us to God, and imprints in us a <hi>character</hi> of the power of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to whose <hi>Empire</hi> we must be subject for ever, and must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo <hi>to all eternity</hi> both in <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> the state of service and subjection to the spirit, grace and conduct of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The grace of <hi>Christianity</hi> makes us the children of God by <hi>mercy,</hi> and gives us right of <hi>inheritance</hi> to the <hi>greatness</hi> and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29616:40"/>
true <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> By this <hi>grace</hi> we have no more part in the <hi>world,</hi> because it is the <hi>heritage</hi> of the true children of <hi>Adam,</hi> but we have right to the <hi>Possession</hi> of God who is himself the <hi>heritage</hi> of his children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This <hi>grace</hi> draws our <hi>spirits,</hi> our <hi>hearts,</hi> and our <hi>affections</hi> from our selves, and all <hi>creatures,</hi> to unite us to God; it gives us right to enter into <hi>familiarity</hi> and <hi>alliance</hi> with the Son of <hi>God,</hi> who making himself man by the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> would be amongst us, to the end that we might be with him. He enters into <hi>society</hi> with men, invests himself with our <hi>miseries</hi> &amp; <hi>infirmities,</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> to us his <hi>life</hi> his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>greatness.</hi> Thus by the <hi>grace</hi> of this <hi>mysterie,</hi> we go out of our own <hi>Interests</hi> to enter into the <hi>Interest</hi> of Jesus Christ, whereof the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaking of the things of the <hi>world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> he saith, <hi>I count them but dung that I may win Christ.</hi>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In brief, by the state of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> we are advanced to the <hi>participation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who will <hi>be all in us,</hi> that we may <hi>be in him,</hi> and Jesus Christ by his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> which he giveth us in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> doth <hi>elevate</hi> and <hi>unite</hi> us to <hi>God,</hi> makes us <hi>live</hi> by his <hi>life, communicates</hi> to us all that he is, that he may <hi>be all things</hi> to us, that the <hi>world</hi> may be <hi>nothing</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> unites us

                  <p>Behold here the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which we have proposed in few words, as having no further <hi>design</hi> nor <hi>intention</hi> in this volume, then to shew that the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be <hi>conformable</hi> to the state of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> whereto he is advanced by <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Now to enter into this <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> it suffices that we see what we are.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29616:41"/>
This is that which I <hi>design'd</hi> to demonstrate in this first part, <hi>proposing</hi> as in a little <hi>Tablet,</hi> the <hi>essence, dignity</hi> and <hi>eminency</hi> of the grace of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which I have done, briefly, expressing onely the principal <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>subject,</hi> leaving the rest to the <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>consideration</hi> of those that would profit thereby.</p>
                  <p>Now if we look back with the eye of <hi>Faith</hi> upon that which hath been said, we shall <hi>clearly</hi> see what a Christian life ought to be, and shall know that the design of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> informing his <hi>Church,</hi> hath been to <hi>consecrate,</hi> to <hi>appropriate</hi> to himself, and to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himself <hi>divinely</hi> to our <hi>souls,</hi> and to <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> them from themselves, and from all <hi>creatures,</hi> that by a happy <hi>revolution</hi> he may be in us, and we in him, we may <hi>live</hi> in him, and of him as he <hi>lives</hi> in his <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> that so he may <hi>restore</hi> us to his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>re-unite</hi> us to himself, from whom we were <hi>separated</hi> by <hi>him,</hi> by being our own, and having relation to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein is comprised the <hi>perfection</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> life, whereof we cannot speak more then in the words of St. <hi>Paul, ye are dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and your life is hid with Christ in God;</hi> a passage which contains an apparent <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> If we are <hi>dead,</hi> how can our <hi>life</hi> be

hid in God, who is the <hi>true life?</hi> If we are in God, who is the <hi>life</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> how are we dead? The <hi>Apostle</hi> meanes that our <hi>life</hi> is <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi>; our <hi>life</hi> is a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> which is the true <hi>life</hi> of <hi>souls,</hi> and much better then the <hi>soul</hi> is the <hi>life</hi> of our <hi>bodies,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in us that which natural <hi>death</hi> doth. By death the <hi>soul</hi> is separated from the <hi>body,</hi> and all things in the <hi>world.</hi> So <hi>grace</hi> should <hi>separate</hi> us from our selves, from all things, from sin, that, being wholly so separated, we may be <hi>dead</hi> to our <hi>selves,</hi> and to all things, that we may <hi>live</hi> in God and of God.</p>
                  <p>This expression of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> further shews all the properties of a <hi>Christian</hi> life, the end whereof is, that, being <hi>separated</hi> from <hi>all</hi> we may be in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that is to say, <hi>united</hi> by an indissoluble <hi>Vnion</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ, life</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and be referred with him to the <hi>glory</hi> of the most <hi>holy Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The life of a <hi>Christian,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith is <hi>hid,</hi> because it is indeed <hi>hid</hi> from the sight of the <hi>World,</hi> which neither <hi>sees</hi> it as it is, nor <hi>esteems</hi> it; and (because it is <hi>little, humble,</hi> and <hi>abject</hi>) disdains to <hi>behold</hi> &amp; to take <hi>notice</hi> of it, as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>society</hi> of men. They that will live <hi>Christianly,</hi> will not subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>corruption</hi> of the men of this age; so this life is <hi>hid</hi> from the <hi>sight,</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29616:42"/>
more from the <hi>power</hi> of this world, for the soul that liveth <hi>christianly,</hi> is above all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, and insensible to all <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi>; and as the <hi>Diamond</hi> continues entire, and strengthened by the violence of <hi>blowes</hi>; so the perfect <hi>christian</hi> remains more content in the violence of <hi>Temptation,</hi> more assured in the motions of <hi>disgrace,</hi> more firm amidst the batteries of <hi>afflictions,</hi> even <hi>Prosperity</hi> changeth not his <hi>spirit,</hi> he is alike in all things, for by <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>true Christian vertues,</hi> the soul is raised above all things, and <hi>lives</hi> in God; <hi>Ye are dead, and yet your life is hid with Iesus Christ in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the life of a <hi>christian</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a life that imitates that of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> upon earth, who according to the <hi>Oracles</hi> of the Prophets, was <hi>despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrow, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</hi> When <hi>Hell,</hi> the <hi>World, Devill, sinners,</hi> thought to triumph over him,<note place="margin">Jo. 10.18.</note> and ravish both his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>life</hi> at the same time, he triumphs over them, shewing that <hi>he hath power</hi> (as he saith) <hi>to lay down his life, and he hath power to take it again</hi> at his pleasure. Thus the life of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is hid from the <hi>eyes</hi> of men, who know him not, and from their <hi>power,</hi> seeing he triumphs over his Enemies, over

Christ,</hi> in <hi>adhering</hi> to him, and <hi>operating</hi> by him; all the perfection of a <hi>christian</hi> soul consists, in that it <hi>dwells</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> that it <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heares</hi> to him, that it <hi>lives</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> not but by his <hi>spirit.</hi>

                  <p>Now this cannot be, but when the Soul is divided from it self,<note place="margin">Col. 3.9.</note> and from all <hi>creatures</hi>; for according to St. <hi>Paul, We are to put off the old man with his deeds, and to put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of him that created him.</hi> Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that <hi>abnegation</hi> and <hi>uncloathing,</hi> is the principal point of <hi>christian perfection,</hi> so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith; <hi>It had been better for us never to have been, then to dwell in our selves, and to our selves</hi>; for the greatest misfortune of the <hi>soul</hi> is to see it self separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God.

                  <p>We see and adore this <hi>proceeding</hi> of God in the <hi>Mysterie</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> the cause and example of the life of our <hi>souls.</hi> For

the eternall <hi>word</hi> choosing <hi>humane nature,</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> himself unto it, and to <hi>operate</hi> in and by it our redemptions would uncloath it of its own <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>humane</hi> person, to shew us that we are not <hi>acceptable</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> if we do not abandon our selves; and that, if we <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi> our selves of our selves, and <hi>deprive</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> of all <hi>created</hi> things, <hi>God</hi> will fill us with <hi>divine things,</hi> for <hi>Grace</hi> as well as <hi>Nature,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres vacuity.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29616:45"/>
the Divinity, had so liberally inriched him, and degraded him of all honour, and put him into a condition of meanness, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and error. This goodly spirit of man, or rather this man all spirit, is now nothing but flesh; this beautiful Soul which breath'd for nothing but Heaven, entertained it self so deliciously in the knowledge of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truths, and was inriched with contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the greatness of God, as with Divine Dew, and heavenly Manna, after so deplorable a fall, obstinately links him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the perishable goods of this World, believes in lies, seeks after vanities, and can no more elevate himself to God; so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and impotent hath sinne made him. O unhappiness which cannot sufficiently be bewailed! Man, who by the happiness of his creation, had eyes to contemplate onely his Creator, and converting himself wholly to him, had no heart but to love him, no spirit but to adhere to him; after so fatall a cast, wholly turn'd away from God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards nothing but himself, is wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Creature, lives as a Beast, onely upon the Earth, and like a Beast with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judgement.</p>
               <p>The Apostle goes further, for describing the estate whereto the sinner is reduced, he declares him uncapable of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29616:45"/>
of things which are of the Spirit of God.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>The natural man,</hi> saith he, <hi>receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> Hence I doubt, least the wayes I intend to propose, which are according to the Spirit of God, appear too high, or above the capacity of our spirits. I confess they are so, if we look upon man in the state of sin, impotency, and the corruption of his Nature. But we shall find the contrary, if we consider that the Sonne of God came into the World to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve man after his fall, to restore him those gifts with advantage which he lost, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him capable of God. In brief, he was made man to teach man the true way to love and serve God; he gives the power, having setled in his Church an inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treasure of Graces, whence all souls may draw strength in their weakness, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in their necessity, and ability in the very impotency of their nature. Here, of <hi>Iesus</hi> man and God, we are to learn the way to love, and adore, and to serve God; from him we must have the grace to do it. We must in and by <hi>Iesus,</hi> operate above our strength, above our being, and natural power, and nothing ought to seem difficult to us, or impossible for him, seeing he gives
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29616:46"/>
us his grace and spirit in abundance to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it.</p>
               <p>To believe this, we must look back upon the designs of the Son of God, in the Profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his gifts and graces, and leasurely examine with the eye of Faith, what he will operate in us, by his grace and divine communications. At the first view we shall see that Grace draws from us our impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, advances us above our nature, gives us a new being, a new life, a life intire and wholly hid in God, a life proper to the state of Christianity, according to which all Christians ought to live. The Son of God speaking to the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and in her to all the faithful, makes a Discourse hereof wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be consider'd, expressing an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to establish his Church.<note place="margin">Joh. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>The houre shall come,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>and now is, wherein the true Worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth, for the Father seeketh such to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him.</hi> The reason he adds, <hi>God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they that worship him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>must worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> What more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and clear testimony of the will of God, who tries and elects Souls that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, in spirit and truth? If he himself doth choose them, and call them to this new life, is it not necessary, that in pursuit of this election, he give them grace necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29616:46"/>
to arrive at such an estate? Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this passage, and ponder all the words of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> shews us that our life must be holy, and severed from the creature, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we must serve God <hi>in Truth,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amusing our selves with the vanities and things of the Earth, which are nothing but lying. <hi>In truth,</hi> that is to say, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Greatness of God, and to that principle whence the Soul takes power to serve God, the grace, spirit, and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Jesus Christ, the spirit of <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We learn further, that if perfection of this life is inward, pure, holy, and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine, seeing it is, and subsists in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of God, who, as <hi>he is a Spirit pure and holy,</hi> will be served and adored <hi>in Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> teaches, that we must wait upon him for this Grace, necessary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his Commands, who requiring of us a life so pure and perfect, obliges himself to give us necessary Graces to arrive unto it, since that without him, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which he teaches. In brief, we see how much we are obliged to require this grace, to search after it, to submit our selves unto it, and to endeavour to become worthy of it. We must not in a matter so
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29616:47"/>
important, as this of our salvation demurre in consideration of our impotency, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our own incapacity, but raising our selves above our selves by the spirit of Faith, we must hope in him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands nothing impossible, who giveth grace abundantly, to accomplish what he demands.</p>
               <p>These are the first dispositions of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and which those souls, that have any desire to live Christianly, ought first of all to learn. But it happens quite contrary; the understanding of men is so corrupt, that they desire not these internal solid vertues, nor require them of God, and, which is worse, many think it unnecessary to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess them; and that such a life as we call interiour, is for few persons, as if Jesus Christ speaking to the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken onely to Her, and not to the whole Church. Others perswade themselves, that it is impossible to attain them, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Apostle, who saith, <hi>I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> a manifest error wherein many lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in not sufficiently considering what they daily see by common experience set before their eyes. If weakest Women, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and Children, have had strength suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, notwithstanding their young and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29616:47"/>
tender bodies, to embrace tortures almost insupportable, and have by Grace been strengthned to overcome those difficulties, why should not we believe also, that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our selves to the power and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Grace, and becoming faithful to the designs of God, we may have sufficient grace and capacity to acquire these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? If by the help of grace they can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain strength of body to support the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of a penitent life, wherefore by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the same grace, may not we arrive to the possession of that true vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Christian life doth consist?</p>
               <p>What difficulty do we find in this kind of life? all the obstacle, (if we neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it) proceeds from not understanding what is the interiour life of the Soul, many believe it a kind of an abstract life, and of the other World, a life full of care, a life which is an enemy to humane society. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers consider it as a life of insupportable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and inaccessible contemplation; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one speaks of it as he pleases. Some condemn it; others say it is impossible, most believe it difficult. Let us not insist upon words, they are explicated to all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; let us onely say, that the life we call interiour, is no other then the life of the Soul, the life of the Soul is God, the grace
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29616:48"/>
of God, the life of his grace, the mother of all vertues. Thus then the interior life is no other then a vertuous Christian life, to which life all Christians are obliged. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and spiritual man must fear God from the bottom of his soul, must highly esteem of all that is in Christianity, and in the Church of God, must be vigilant to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to displease God, careful to preserve his Soul and Conscience in the purity of grace, and, as the Apostle saith, having a <hi>good Conscience in all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 13.18.</note> to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of God from the bottom of his heart, and of all that belongs to God, and to carry a mean esteem of himself and all Creatures. To live in this manner, is that which I call an inward life, the rest without this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to teach Souls any other life, is to betray them.</p>
               <p>Now who sees not that all Christians are obliged to this kind of life, if they will be saved? who findes not now how much this life is easier then it was represented, and all together contrary to what was expected? Let us then take a firm resolution to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and to give our selves with all our Souls to him, who hath given himself to us. He hath right and power to live in us, to do in us, and of us all that he pleases. Let us onely take care that we commit our selves
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29616:48"/>
to his conduct, and to the operation of his holy Spirit, and being assisted by his Grace; Let us <hi>chearfully</hi> endeavour the <hi>acquisition</hi> of <hi>Christian vertues</hi>; Let us so order, that <hi>grace may reign in us,</hi> according to the <hi>design</hi> of God, that God <hi>may dwell in us, as in a living tabernacle,</hi> which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his blood, and we shall see by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that with the Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note>

               <p>BEfore I proceed, I must <hi>suppose</hi> that I speak to <hi>souls</hi> desirous to <hi>live vertuously</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> in the state of <hi>Christianity,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Jesus Christ, the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule.</hi> My address is to such who are <hi>faithfull</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensators of the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> of God, will make use thereof according to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> of the Son of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to profit a <hi>hundred fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first <hi>thing</hi> that I ask of them, is, <hi>What is the end of the life and actions of a Christian</hi>?
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29616:49"/>
For as in things <hi>naturall</hi> &amp; <hi>artificiall,</hi> the first thought and knowledge of the <hi>workman,</hi> is the end of his <hi>work</hi>; so in <hi>Piety,</hi> we must consider and know the <hi>end,</hi> and the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Christian actions,</hi> that knowing them we may resolve <hi>couragiously</hi> to undertake them, and <hi>promise</hi> our selves great <hi>fidelity</hi> in the <hi>practice</hi> of all that shall be <hi>proposed</hi> to us, or is <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> for to <hi>arrive</hi> at so <hi>happy</hi> an estate.</p>
               <p>We know the <hi>end</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> soul is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.23.</note> who is <hi>he that filleth all in all,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle</hi>; whom it <hi>seeketh</hi> to, and <hi>possesseth</hi> as its sole <hi>happiness,</hi> and to <hi>enjoy</hi> him for ever. None reject this <hi>truth,</hi> though it appear <hi>high</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi>; for they that discourse ordinarily of <hi>Christian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> say all that it <hi>consists</hi> in the <hi>love</hi> of God, and in <hi>perfect charity,</hi> which is true. But if we consider what this <hi>love</hi> means, we shall find, that it is nothing but the <hi>possession</hi> of God, for the <hi>love</hi> of God hath <hi>priviledge</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to give God, who is <hi>essentiall love.</hi> Thus considering this <hi>truth,</hi> we shall find that <hi>perfection consists in love,</hi> which <hi>love</hi> gives us the <hi>possession</hi> of God; therefore the <hi>perfection</hi> of our <hi>soul</hi> must be the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> He that will <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>excellency</hi> of this, must know the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> from which <hi>knowledge</hi> he shall <hi>learn</hi> what the <hi>life</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> must be, what our <hi>entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:29616:49"/>
and how holy our <hi>actions</hi> ought to be: For if the <hi>means</hi> be proportionable to the <hi>end,</hi> it must necessarily follow, that the <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> being <hi>supernaturall,</hi> and nothing less then <hi>God</hi> himself, the <hi>means</hi> also that we must use to <hi>arrive</hi> to this <hi>end,</hi> must be <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall</hi> and <hi>divine.</hi> They therefore who seek <hi>perfection</hi> in the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of this <hi>end,</hi> must have a particular <hi>care,</hi> not only to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>uses</hi> which may <hi>conduct</hi> them, but <hi>shun</hi> and <hi>contemne</hi> all <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous</hi> things, which serve not to attain to this <hi>end,</hi> and must detest them.</p>
               <p>We must remember that we cannot <hi>arrive</hi> at this <hi>end</hi>; nor to the <hi>possession</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (who is the <hi>perfection</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> his <hi>fulness,</hi> and the <hi>consummation</hi> of his <hi>soul</hi>) but by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of God himself, by <hi>grace</hi> alone and <hi>mercy,</hi> and according to the <hi>testimony</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> none can <hi>arrive</hi> to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, but by his <hi>divine Light,</hi> and by a speciall <hi>Revelation:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Joh. 15.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Without me,</hi> saith he, <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> On the one side the <hi>soul</hi> sees and confesses, that God is her <hi>perfection,</hi> her <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> and <hi>heritage,</hi> that in <hi>him</hi> she hath all; that he alone is her <hi>sufficiency,</hi> her <hi>life</hi> and <hi>consummation.</hi> On the other side she finds, that she cannot <hi>go</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> nor <hi>enjoy him,</hi> nor <hi>think</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>by him,</hi> that is to say, <hi>by his grace, by his infinite mercy</hi>; she feels that she bears in the <hi>bottom</hi> of her <hi>being,</hi> not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, impotency</hi> and <hi>feeblness,</hi> but of <hi>oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to <hi>grace,</hi> to the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>work</hi> of God. On the other side, she carries the <hi>effects</hi> of Gods <hi>love,</hi> she knows the <hi>power</hi> of God over her, who can <hi>advance</hi> her to what degree of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi> it shall please him, and do in her, and by her all that he <hi>pleases.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this consideration, man must <hi>adore</hi> the secret <hi>Iudgements, will,</hi> and <hi>designes</hi> of God over his <hi>Creature</hi>; he must humble himself in his <hi>nothing,</hi> annihilate himself in his <hi>humility,</hi> and by his knowledge see into the <hi>little</hi> he is, the <hi>need</hi> he hath of God, and the <hi>misery</hi> of a <hi>Soul without</hi> grace.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the practise and means whereby we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the possession of God, of his grace and spirit.</head>
               <p>IT much imports <hi>souls</hi> that seek after God, and would live in the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that they <hi>endeavour</hi> to enter and settle themselves in <hi>good</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> dispositions, for that God chiefly regards in us; and we are not <hi>ignorant</hi> that the <hi>operations</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> are alwayes <hi>proportioned</hi> to the <hi>disposition</hi> she puts or finds in the <hi>soul.</hi> Now amongst all <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> the most <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> the chief path of the <hi>soul</hi> to true <hi>vertue,</hi> is <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>truth.</hi> We must love <hi>truth,</hi> and strongly adhere to it: we must wholly study to fill our <hi>spirits</hi> with the knowledge of this <hi>Truth,</hi> that it may be unto us a foundation to <hi>Christian</hi> life, a light in the <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of our actions. Therefore before I propose any <hi>practise,</hi> I alwayes put <hi>Truth</hi> for a foundation of <hi>Exercises</hi> necessary to our subject.</p>
               <p>Let us then consider as a certain <hi>Principle</hi> that the more we <hi>act</hi> for our selves, and for the <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>being,</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct our selves, or our own <hi>spirit,</hi> the more
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29616:51"/>
we estrange our selves from God, and by consequence from the <hi>end</hi> for which we are <hi>created,</hi> from the <hi>perfection</hi> whereto we are obliged. The <hi>spirit</hi> which is in us is the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> our nature, the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore is it a <hi>nature</hi> become damnable by <hi>sins,</hi> a <hi>spirit</hi> infused into us by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> possessing us in the <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Adam.</hi> This <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> is subject to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of the <hi>Devill</hi> and <hi>sinne,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot <hi>act</hi> but according to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> whereto it is a slave, for <hi>operation</hi> followes <hi>essence.</hi> As this <hi>being</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is estranged from God, and <hi>enemy</hi> to him,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> for by nature we are born the <hi>children of wrath,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) so it cannot act but against God. Now by this reducement, man is drawn out of this <hi>Captivity,</hi> freed from this <hi>bondage,</hi> and made a new <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>Grace</hi>; he acts no more according to the Principle of his own being, but by the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which gives him a new being, making him a new <hi>Creature</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> To arrive to this <hi>Liberty,</hi> which we call the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of the <hi>children</hi> of God, two things are requisite, the <hi>mercy</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> of God, and the <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>co-operation</hi> of the <hi>soul.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> therefore that will live <hi>vertuously,</hi> must first give himself to <hi>God,</hi> offer him his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>intire consent</hi> to all the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29616:52"/>
                  <hi>designes</hi> he hath upon him, and to all the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> which he will by his <hi>grace</hi> operate in him: Then he must <hi>study</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself from this <hi>bondage,</hi> to shake off the yoak of sin, which <hi>oppresses</hi> and <hi>drags</hi> him whither it will to free himself, he must quit himself, that is, his <hi>imperfections,</hi> his <hi>passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inclinations,</hi> and, much more, sinne; he must kill this <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and pluck it up by the <hi>root,</hi> that it may the better make room for the <hi>spirit</hi> of God; that this holy <hi>spirit</hi> may <hi>live</hi> in him, and <hi>act</hi> by him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he can no way <hi>possess</hi> the true <hi>christian vertue,</hi> nor attain the <hi>perfection,</hi> whereto he is obliged, nor the end whereto he is <hi>created,</hi> the <hi>possession</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows, that the first <hi>exercises</hi> whereto the <hi>soul</hi> must apply it self, is to place it self in the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> to draw it self out of the <hi>bondage</hi> of sin, and to annihilate in it self the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> which it carries in the very <hi>marrow</hi> of its bones. Here it must begin, all other <hi>exercises</hi> are but unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without this, and all it does will be to no <hi>purpose,</hi> unless it arrive to this <hi>point.</hi> For we must remember, that the <hi>vertue</hi> to be truly <hi>Christian,</hi> is the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> who <hi>acts</hi> in us, and that the <hi>perfection</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> consists in <hi>love,</hi> a love that is never without the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> of God; it is easie then to conclude
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29616:52"/>
and <hi>believe,</hi> that he that will be vertuous, and a perfect Christian, must make room for God in his heart, there <hi>establish</hi> God, there cause his <hi>spirit</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>live.</hi> He must <hi>root</hi> out, and expel all that is contrary and in enmity to God, even all that is not God;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.30.</note> for <hi>he that is not with me,</hi> saith Jesus Christ, <hi>is against me.</hi> The true <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>principall</hi> care of a <hi>Christian</hi> consists herein, all others that <hi>abut</hi> not upon this, we must <hi>despise,</hi> saying with St. <hi>Paul, in Iesus Christ, neither circumcision availeth any thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but faith which is by love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the onely question is, how we may <hi>arrive</hi> to this <hi>happiness</hi>; herein is the <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> We say it is by inward and outward <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> by the <hi>senses,</hi> and by the <hi>spirit,</hi> by <hi>vigilancy</hi> in all things, that we neither <hi>receive, consult,</hi> nor do any thing contrary to God, or that may <hi>displease</hi> him; by <hi>prayer,</hi> by <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi> In fine, it is by the <hi>grace</hi> of God, for it belongs to God alone and <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to make us <hi>free,</hi> and draw us out of the <hi>captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of our selves and sin. <hi>If the Sonne shall make you free,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 8.36.</note> 
                  <hi>you shall be free indeed,</hi> saith <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> It is an effect onely of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, who alone can <hi>give</hi> us a new <hi>estate,</hi> and <hi>reestablish</hi> all in us. Wherefore when we have laboured and done all that we are able, we must think that we have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29616:53"/>
done <hi>nothing,</hi> we must have recourse to <hi>grace;</hi> we must enter into an humble <hi>resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our <hi>misery,</hi> we must cry after <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for our relief. Herein it is good to forme often these following <hi>acts,</hi> or rather to carry them continually in the bottom of our hearts; we must desire, with a desire full of <hi>efficacy</hi> to be <hi>filled</hi> and <hi>possessed</hi> by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>submit</hi> all to him, to <hi>require</hi> this <hi>grace</hi> of him with <hi>humility</hi>; to offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selves to him for it, giving him from this time, and alwayes the <hi>consent</hi> that he requires of us, and when we find that he gives us the <hi>first fruits</hi> of his <hi>spirit,</hi> that he begins to live and move in us, then we must be faithful in <hi>correspondence</hi> thereunto, and preserve a great <hi>attention</hi> to his motions, and <hi>divine</hi> and inward operations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must often <hi>renounce</hi> our selves, our <hi>self-love,</hi> and our <hi>spirit,</hi> to sacrifice our selves before God, that is, to <hi>renounce</hi> our own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, inclinations</hi> and <hi>dispositions,</hi> to live no longer, then in the holy <hi>will, intentions,</hi> divine and adorable dispositions of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For as anciently, the <hi>victime</hi> was not onely <hi>killed,</hi> but also consumed before God; so we must <hi>offer</hi> our selves after the same manner, that God may <hi>annihilate</hi> and <hi>consume</hi> in us, all that is of us; we must <hi>aske</hi> it of God, not out of <hi>self-interest</hi> &amp; <hi>profit,</hi> but for his <hi>glory,</hi> out of a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29616:53"/>
desire that his <hi>holy will</hi> may be fulfilled in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We must pray <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to work in us an <hi>effect</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and not to wait after our <hi>infirmites,</hi> to establish in us his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> his <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>spirit.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. That by Creation man is obliged to tend to this perfection, and to resign himself to God.</head>
               <p>WHen we say that <hi>man</hi> is <hi>obliged</hi> to tend to <hi>perfection,</hi> we <hi>impose</hi> not a new <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>propose</hi> the <hi>indispensible</hi> duty he oweth to his <hi>Creator.</hi> For as a <hi>creature</hi> he belongs to God his <hi>Creator,</hi> he depends on him, and (though he would not, yet) must he subsist onely by him. In this quality he must <hi>live</hi> not only subject to his <hi>government</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> but is obliged by the <hi>Law</hi> of all <hi>created beings,</hi> according to the <hi>intention</hi> of his <hi>Authour,</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> prescribed him: For as the <hi>creature</hi> hath no other <hi>being,</hi> then what he received of his <hi>Creator,</hi> so his <hi>being</hi> hath no other <hi>power</hi> nor <hi>end,</hi> then what he, who gave him that <hi>being,</hi> giveth and prescribes to him. By the same <hi>Principle</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his <hi>being</hi> from God, he is obliged to <hi>act</hi> conformable to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>end</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to him. All <hi>creatures</hi> employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves according to the <hi>capacity</hi> of their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:29616:54"/>
in that for which God <hi>created</hi> them; they tend <hi>directly</hi> (if they go not aside) to the <hi>end</hi> for which they were <hi>created</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> Man above all the rest, ought to do the same, to <hi>live</hi> according to the <hi>capacity</hi> he hath received of God, <hi>incessantly</hi> to tend to the <hi>end</hi> which the <hi>divine</hi> wisdome hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to him: For God in the <hi>creation</hi> of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> seemed to have regard to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>man;</hi> he stayd not till he had made him, thought onely of <hi>perfecting</hi> him: he made the <hi>world,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> as if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed not himself unto it; he spake but a <hi>word,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> was made; but <hi>man,</hi> the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>hands,</hi> to which he applies his care, he <hi>polisheth</hi> him with the touches of <hi>divine perfection,</hi> makes him the <hi>Master-piece</hi> of his <hi>work,</hi> the last draught of his <hi>created perfection,</hi> framing him after his own <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>designing</hi> him for <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In what respect soever then we consider <hi>man,</hi> we shall see by the condition of his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and favour of his <hi>Creator,</hi> that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to great <hi>perfection,</hi> since the <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>being</hi> regards nothing but God. He is in a <hi>capacity</hi> to <hi>love</hi> him, and is <hi>created</hi> to <hi>possess</hi> him. O <hi>man!</hi> why dost thou not see the <hi>dignity</hi> of thy <hi>being,</hi> the <hi>happiness</hi> which thou mayst <hi>possess,</hi> the <hi>eminency</hi> of the <hi>condition</hi> whereto thou art <hi>created?</hi> Thou
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29616:55"/>
onely of all <hi>creatures</hi> bearest the <hi>effects,</hi> the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of thy <hi>Creator</hi>; thou onely art <hi>capable</hi> to <hi>love</hi> him; that which he hath <hi>refused</hi> all other <hi>creatures,</hi> he hath in <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance bestowed</hi> on thee. After so great a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> darest thou <hi>appear</hi> without <hi>love?</hi> Canst thou <hi>live</hi> without <hi>loving</hi> him who <hi>created</hi> thee onely to <hi>love</hi> him?</p>
               <p>When we say that <hi>man</hi> by the <hi>condition</hi> of his <hi>being</hi> hath a <hi>capacity</hi> to <hi>love</hi> God, we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the highest <hi>benefit,</hi> the most signall <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> that he hath received of his <hi>Creator,</hi> for the capacity to <hi>love</hi> him, giveth him power to <hi>possess</hi> him.</p>
               <p>All <hi>creatures,</hi> indeed, even the most <hi>insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> feel the <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of their <hi>Creator;</hi> they are left to the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of their God, but not one hath power to <hi>love</hi> him, but man, who was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only for this <hi>end,</hi> being made <hi>capable</hi> to <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Creator.</hi> Therewith God hath not only given him this <hi>capacity,</hi> and the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> of so <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> a <hi>quality,</hi> but <hi>wills</hi> also that all that he hath <hi>created,</hi> should fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him in this <hi>love,</hi> and serve as <hi>motives</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> him to <hi>love.</hi> Is not <hi>man</hi> then obliged to <hi>love,</hi> so <hi>good,</hi> so <hi>kind,</hi> so <hi>liberall</hi> a <hi>Creator;</hi> and if he be obliged to <hi>love</hi> him, is he not as much obliged to <hi>perfection,</hi> seeing this <hi>perfection</hi> consists in <hi>love,</hi> which gives us God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:29616:55"/>God in creating man, useth another <hi>meanes</hi> to oblige him to him, and to seek <hi>perfection</hi> in that, besides making him <hi>capable</hi> to <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Creator,</hi> he hath assigned as the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of his <hi>being</hi> the <hi>possession</hi> of his <hi>Creator.</hi> This resentment the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> giveth us. <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us that the end of man is <hi>supernatural,</hi> that this end is no other then God, whom man must possess. Thus by <hi>Creation,</hi> man is not onely in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to <hi>love</hi> God, (a most singular favour) but hath also for his <hi>end</hi> the <hi>possession</hi> of God himself. Whence we must <hi>conclude,</hi> that as every thing seeketh its <hi>perfection,</hi> and by a <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> instinct, runs to its last end to enjoy it and repose there; so man being created to <hi>possess</hi> God, his ultimate end, carries an instinct that drawes him to God, and by the same <hi>Law</hi> whereby he is <hi>naturally</hi> obliged to seek <hi>perfection,</hi> he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>seek</hi> God in <hi>love</hi> and <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> in whom consists his <hi>perfection.</hi> This <hi>instinct</hi> is naturall and proper to him, as it is naturall to a <hi>stone</hi> to tend downward, and to <hi>fire</hi> to mount upward; whereby it is evident, that we must <hi>promise</hi> our selves not onely in <hi>Heaven</hi> the fulfilling of this <hi>Law,</hi> but we must begin it upon <hi>earth,</hi> and from the first use of our <hi>reason,</hi> observe this precept. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this capacity of <hi>Love</hi> is fulfilled and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29616:56"/>
perfected in <hi>Heaven,</hi> onely in the state of <hi>glory,</hi> but we must begin to <hi>love</hi> here. We must <hi>resign</hi> to God who is our end, if in the end we will <hi>possess</hi> him, <hi>for whatsoever a Man soweth,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Considering these <hi>truths,</hi> it is impossible to conceive to what <hi>blindness</hi> the corruption of <hi>times</hi> have reduced the <hi>spirits</hi> of men, who being born for <hi>Heaven</hi> onely, spend all their thoughts on <hi>Earth,</hi> and separating themselves from their God, are so strongly <hi>fetter'd</hi> to the <hi>Creature,</hi> that they know not what <hi>perfection</hi> is, believing they have power to <hi>dispence</hi> with so holy a <hi>Law.</hi> But can this <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> be blotted out of our <hi>hearts?</hi> Can we despise it, notwithstanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>reasons</hi> that oblige us to it? Is there any thing more reasonable then to <hi>love</hi> them that <hi>love</hi> us? what greater <hi>love</hi> could God testifie to us, then to make us capable to

                  <hi>love</hi> him, and to create us to <hi>possess</hi> him? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>nature</hi> obliges us hereto, this <hi>benefit</hi> is an act of <hi>Love.</hi> God loving us to be beloved again, we can do no lesse in <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of this benefit of <hi>love,</hi> but perfectly <hi>love</hi> him; we can never deny we are obliged to this <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> if we would not be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> of <hi>ingratitude,</hi> nor can we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it but by <hi>loving</hi> him.

               <p>The better to <hi>understand</hi> this, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that by <hi>sinne,</hi> man is equally <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in two <hi>considerations,</hi> the <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of <hi>sinne</hi> which oppress him, and the <hi>evills</hi> and <hi>disorders</hi> whereinto <hi>sinne</hi> precipitates him; from which <hi>two states,</hi> he cannot get but by <hi>possessing</hi> of God. For the first, <hi>faith</hi> teaches
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29616:59"/>
us, that <hi>man</hi> cannot get out of <hi>sin,</hi> do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he can, if God himself come not to <hi>relieve</hi> and <hi>deliver</hi> him. <hi>Man,</hi> of himself, may <hi>lose</hi> himself, may <hi>plunge</hi> himself, may <hi>sell</hi> himself, may <hi>enslave</hi> himself, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>free</hi> himself, nor <hi>bestow</hi> himself, but by the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, who gave us his <hi>Son,</hi> to <hi>re-establish</hi> all <hi>things</hi> in us, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. Now, this <hi>re-establishment</hi> is done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> which is the <hi>spirit</hi> of God in us, given to us. From whence we see, that he that will <hi>avoid</hi> his <hi>miseries,</hi> and <hi>shake</hi> off the <hi>yoke</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> must necessarily <hi>possess</hi> God, who onely can <hi>free</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Hence we may observe, what a work the <hi>conversion</hi> of a <hi>soul</hi> to God is, and the <hi>freeing</hi> of a <hi>sinner,</hi> by what way soever it is wrought in <hi>man.</hi> To apprehend <hi>properly</hi> the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this <hi>work</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> we must say, that he that would be <hi>converted,</hi> and <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from <hi>sin,</hi> must not onely go out of his <hi>sin,</hi> but must also <hi>possess</hi> God, and consequently by the same <hi>Motive</hi> that he <hi>desires</hi> to go out of his <hi>sin,</hi> he is obliged to <hi>dispose</hi> himself to <hi>possess</hi> God, and to become <hi>worthy</hi> of so <hi>holy</hi> an <hi>heritage</hi>; for to <hi>confess</hi> his <hi>sin,</hi> to <hi>turn</hi> to God, to be <hi>delivered</hi> from his <hi>sin,</hi> and to <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess</hi> God is all one <hi>thing</hi>; wherein appears the <hi>need</hi> we have to <hi>seek</hi> God, and how

seriously a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to <hi>labour</hi> in an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire,</hi> wherein his eternal safety doth <hi>consist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> state of our <hi>miseries,</hi> doth no lesse <hi>oblige</hi> us to seek God then the <hi>former,</hi> for by the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> and the <hi>Tyranny</hi> it exercises over us, we are continually <hi>tossed</hi> about, <hi>disorder'd</hi> made <hi>vagabonds,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated from <hi>imperfection</hi> to <hi>imperfection,</hi> from sin to sin, from <hi>trouble</hi> to <hi>trouble.</hi> This evil hath no <hi>remedy,</hi> what <hi>resolution</hi> soever the <hi>soul</hi> takes, what <hi>diligence</hi> soever it <hi>useth,</hi> what <hi>habit</hi> soever it <hi>assumes,</hi> it will never find <hi>calme, rest,</hi> or <hi>deliverance,</hi> till it hath found and <hi>possesses</hi> God, and be <hi>possessed</hi> of him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall she be in true <hi>liberty, Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the <hi>liberty</hi> of the <hi>children</hi> of God, until she possesses the <hi>spirit</hi> of God; wherein they deceive themselves, who to <hi>acquire</hi> the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> and true <hi>liberty</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> use a thousand <hi>practises,</hi> and a multitude of <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises</hi>; peace and true <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> being not to be found but in the <hi>possession</hi> of God. Many things indeed that we <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> serve to lessen our <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>thraldom,</hi> but not one can give true <hi>liberty,</hi> or the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> but the <hi>possession</hi> of God. The reason is <hi>demonstrative</hi>; nothing can have <hi>peace, liberty,</hi> and <hi>repose,</hi> but in its proper <hi>Centre.</hi> God is the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in God alone is her <hi>peace, liberty,</hi> and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29616:60"/>
                  <hi>repose,</hi> and as long as she is with God, and <hi>possesses</hi> him, she is in <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>repose</hi> no longer. Whence we evidently <hi>conclude,</hi> that while the <hi>soul</hi> is <hi>separated</hi> from God, she is <hi>tyrannized</hi> over by the <hi>malice</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawn into <hi>circumstances, terms,</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions.</hi> And <hi>souls</hi> that make shew to <hi>search</hi> after the <hi>truth,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> if they seek not God <hi>purely,</hi> and <hi>seriously</hi>; if he dwelleth not in the bottom of their <hi>hearts,</hi> shall never <hi>live</hi> but in <hi>disquiet,</hi> and in <hi>trouble,</hi> in <hi>scruples,</hi> and in <hi>Pannick ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:</hi> For it's an infallible <hi>maxime, That man can never rest but in the possession of God, the contre of his soul.</hi>

                  <hi>Eschew evil, and do good;</hi> words that contain all Laws, <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>humane</hi>; for they onely forbid <hi>evil,</hi> and command <hi>good</hi>; words so absolute and generally true, that he who keeps this <hi>Commandment,</hi> shall certainly be <hi>perfect.</hi> It is not needfull to explicate this <hi>Proposition,</hi> it is a naturall <hi>Precept,</hi> a <hi>Law</hi> God hath graven in the bottom of <hi>Reason,</hi> that none might be <hi>ignorant</hi> of it, that all might be without <hi>excuse</hi> before the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of God. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, (O unhappiness of <hi>humane nature!</hi>) since the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so <hi>unworthy,</hi> so <hi>criminall,</hi> that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without the <hi>favour</hi> of God, either <hi>eschew evil,</hi> or <hi>do good,</hi> so evident is it, that man hath need of God.</p>
               <p>As children of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are children of <hi>malediction,</hi> begotten in a generall <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> conceived in <hi>sin,</hi> born children of <hi>wrath. Adam</hi> indeed gave us <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> but subject to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29616:62"/>
subjects us to the <hi>Devil,</hi> confining us to his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>conduct.</hi> From the <hi>womb</hi> we bear the yoke of <hi>sin,</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith, we are in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> so far <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> that without the <hi>grace</hi> of God we can do nothing but <hi>works</hi> of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>captivity,</hi> wherein we see the need we have of God to <hi>avoid</hi> this <hi>misery.</hi> For if from our <hi>birth</hi> we are subjected to the <hi>tyranny</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> doubtless we should be drawn to all <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>vice</hi>; there is no <hi>sin</hi> which man would not <hi>commit,</hi> if God did not withold him; <hi>Every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thought of his heart is onely evil continually</hi> (sayes God of man) so <hi>evil,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This it is Saint <hi>Austin</hi> means in his <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> when he thanks God, not onely for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering</hi> him from the <hi>sins</hi> he committed, but also for <hi>restraining</hi> him from all others. <hi>I ascribe it unto thy grace,</hi> saith he, <hi>that thou hast dissolved my sins, as the Sun doth Ice.</hi> I refer to thy <hi>mercy,</hi> all the <hi>sins</hi> which I have not committed. I confess that all hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given me, as well that which I did of my own <hi>will,</hi> as that which I did not commit,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29616:62"/>
being <hi>prevented</hi> and <hi>aided</hi> by thy <hi>grace.</hi> Where he <hi>teacheth</hi> us, that without the <hi>grace</hi> of God we cannot shun <hi>evill</hi>; thus is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the need we have of God. If the <hi>Lord of Sabboth</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul out of the Prophet</hi>) <hi>had left us a seed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 9.29</note> 
                  <hi>we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not hard to conceive, if, by the way we consider, that man, as the Sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> is degraded from the <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> of God, deprived of <hi>grace,</hi> despoyl'd of all his <hi>gifts,</hi> cruelly wounded in his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is separated from <hi>God,</hi> hath wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted himself to the <hi>Creature,</hi> and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, and plunged in this deplorable <hi>condition,</hi> is so <hi>impotent,</hi> that he cannot <hi>raise</hi> himself according to his <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> up to <hi>God,</hi> unless assisted by the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> who onely can draw us out of the <hi>abysse</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> reinvest us in <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> as with new gifts merited by his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> he alone can lead us to <hi>God</hi>; and as without him, we <hi>separate</hi> our selves continually from <hi>God,</hi> so with his <hi>assistance</hi> we <hi>approach</hi> unto him, and by his <hi>grace,</hi> we who were <hi>children</hi> of <hi>cursing,</hi> are made <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>blessing.</hi> Wherein, on one side appeareth the miserable <hi>estate</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are reduced as <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>; on the other, the great need we have of <hi>God</hi> and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29616:63"/>
his <hi>assistance.</hi> Now in considering these <hi>truths,</hi> if we have any sense of <hi>salvation,</hi> will we not immediately say that we are <hi>obliged</hi> to seek <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>implore</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>spirit,</hi> and strongly to renounce the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and to resign our selves wholly to the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing and acknowledging before the <hi>throne</hi> of his <hi>mercies,</hi> the <hi>need</hi> we have of him, to eschew <hi>evill,</hi> which is man's first <hi>duty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we examine the <hi>need</hi> we have of <hi>God,</hi> to do good and <hi>practise vertue,</hi> we shall find our selves in the like indigence. <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us, that we cannot do any work of <hi>salvation,</hi> if we be not joyned to God by <hi>grace,</hi> and, as <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> saith, <hi>as the branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 15.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</hi> We can do nothing of our <hi>selves,</hi> as our <hi>selves,</hi> because <hi>sinne</hi> hath brought us into such a condition, that being dispoiled of the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, and made unworthy of his <hi>grace,</hi> we are reduced to such <hi>impotence,</hi> that we can neither <hi>serve</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> God, nor do any <hi>good work,</hi> if we have not of him <hi>grace, strength,</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> to do it. He alone gives us the thought of <hi>good,</hi> nor is that sufficient, he must give us also the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> to accomplish it, which when we have also received, if God
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29616:63"/>
himself give us not the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of it, it is <hi>nothing.</hi> For notwithstanding all the <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>resolutions</hi> in the World, we shall never put them in <hi>practise</hi> without <hi>grace,</hi> and after all this perseverance in <hi>good,</hi> is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>for he onely shall be crowned who continues to the end.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.10</note> Yet we cannot <hi>have,</hi> nor <hi>merit</hi> it, it is the <hi>gift</hi> onely of the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, a pure effect of his <hi>bounty.</hi> Herein appears the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream <hi>need</hi> that we have of God, how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary this <hi>grace</hi> is to us, not onely to <hi>do well,</hi> but also to <hi>persevere.</hi> From these <hi>truths</hi> we learn that a <hi>Christian</hi> that will be saved, must not onely have a <hi>good will,</hi> or entertain a <hi>good intention,</hi> but further he must seriously <hi>seek</hi> God, <hi>adhere</hi> to him, and <hi>possess</hi> him, since in him alone consisteth the <hi>grace</hi> that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to <hi>do well,</hi> and to <hi>end well,</hi> in a holy <hi>perseverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvation</hi> is not a thing so easie as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for we have nothing at all in our <hi>selves</hi> as our <hi>selves,</hi> that can help to <hi>save</hi> us.

They seek not in <hi>Iesus Christ strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to <hi>work,</hi> for they think not of it, being so blind that they <hi>rely</hi> upon themselves, and by secret esteem of their own <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>Labours,</hi> easily perswade themselves, that there is <hi>Vertue,</hi> where none is, and that they are in some <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> when they are very <hi>far</hi> from it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in their own <hi>good will,</hi> or in a simple <hi>intention,</hi> which they think <hi>good.</hi> Believing this enough for them, they <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise</hi> all the rest, which is of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>Now, to remedy this <hi>evil,</hi> which is not to be <hi>neglected,</hi> you must <hi>practise</hi> what I shall tell you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We must be in <hi>will</hi> and perpetuall <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in a <hi>resolution</hi> not to <hi>love</hi> or <hi>act,</hi> but by <hi>grace,</hi> and by the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi>; this <hi>desire</hi> is a <hi>disposition</hi> little known, yet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29616:65"/>
more <hi>important</hi> then it seems; for <hi>God</hi> will be desired, and takes pleasure to see a <hi>soul thirst</hi> and <hi>run</hi> after him: We see that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his great <hi>mercies,</hi> and gave not his <hi>sonne</hi> to the world, till 4000 years after man had <hi>desired</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must demand his <hi>spirit</hi> with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness, crying from the bottom of our <hi>hearts,</hi> after <hi>Iesus</hi> the onely <hi>freer</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> the true principle of <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. All our <hi>recourse</hi> must be to <hi>Iesus</hi>; not relying, or confiding in any thing but his <hi>power, vertue</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> and act by his dispositions. This is properly that we call <hi>acting</hi> by the <hi>spirit,</hi> and by submission to <hi>grace.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> who becomes unto us by God, <hi>Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> These words represent unto us two <hi>truths.

               </p>
               <p>By those <hi>truths</hi> we learn that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> being the true <hi>gift</hi> of God, we have nothing if we <hi>possess</hi> not him.

               <p>If we proceed a little further in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>lights</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> we shall find a

               </p>
               <p>This expresseth the <hi>perfection</hi> whereto God hath called us; These <hi>truths</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will cause us highly to esteem the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> These <hi>motives</hi> are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29616:68"/>
so <hi>powerfull,</hi> that they seem not only to <hi>invite,</hi> but to <hi>constrain</hi> us by <hi>amorous</hi> allurements to <hi>resign</hi> our selves wholly to God. Let us adde a common <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> as the last <hi>draught</hi> of this admirable <hi>conduct. The conduct,</hi> saith he, <hi>of Iesus in us, is admirable, in that he hath as much care of one single soul, as well as of all; his wisdom is employed for one soul as well as for all; and he loves one soul with the same infinite love wherewith he loves all; yea, he loves his elect and Christians, with the same love wherewith he loveth himself.</hi> Here let us stop, for more cannot be said; Let us <hi>adore</hi> this <hi>love</hi> which <hi>operates</hi> with great things in the <hi>souls</hi> of the <hi>Elect.</hi> Let us <hi>love</hi> him who <hi>loves</hi> us so much; and let us <hi>live</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of him who <hi>lives</hi> in us. If we reflect upon these <hi>truths,</hi> justly may we be astonished at the <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>blindness</hi> of those who make so many difficulties to <hi>resign</hi> themselves wholly both <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> to the <hi>conduct</hi> of God, and absolutely to abandon themselves to the <hi>providence, love</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi> What? can any man yet doubt of the <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God? distrust his <hi>wisdom</hi> after so manifest a <hi>truth?</hi> Is it possible a <hi>Christian</hi> can imagin that he is to take <hi>care</hi> of the <hi>creature,</hi> that humane prudence is necessary where God vouchsafes by his <hi>bounty</hi> to apply and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his <hi>care, wisdom,</hi> and infinite <hi>goodness?</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:29616:69"/>
But only to apply himself to the way of <hi>God,</hi> that is to say, with an <hi>application</hi> worthy of God, <hi>perfect</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is <hi>perfect; good,</hi> as God is <hi>good,</hi> accommodating himself, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the commodity and feebleness of the <hi>creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we adhere to these <hi>truths,</hi> it is fit, that as <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we live sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his <hi>will,</hi> abandon our selves to his loving <hi>conduct,</hi> endeavouring nothing so much as to <hi>please</hi> and <hi>satisfie</hi> him.

The true <hi>Christian</hi> must make a strong <hi>resolution</hi> to rely onely on God, all other things being <hi>indifferent</hi> unto him, whence he will endeavour to <hi>follow</hi> and <hi>accept</hi> with tranquillity of <hi>spirit,</hi> all that God <hi>ordains,</hi> and to establish himself wholly in this <hi>confidence</hi> of God, in this <hi>conformity</hi> and <hi>relyance</hi> on the conduct of <hi>Iesus.</hi> He will study to bear in his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> a contempt of all <hi>naturall prudence,</hi> in making little account even of things that <hi>depend</hi> on his <hi>grace,</hi> saying to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he will onely rely on <hi>Iesus</hi> who is his <hi>All,</hi> and that whatever happen, <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall grace,</hi> which is the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> will never fail to give him as much <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> in all things, as shall be <hi>necessary</hi> for him, but far more <hi>profitably,</hi> and more <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> then <hi>humane prudence</hi> can do.</p>

the <hi>spirit</hi> of God. And because nature useth to insinuate amidst <hi>grace,</hi> and, <hi>disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> her self, dissemble to be what she is not, (we not knowing it, and even contrary to our own intentions) to prevent this deceit, and to <hi>assure</hi> our selves in a matter so <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> yet hard to be <hi>discovered,</hi> it is necessary that the <hi>Christian</hi> with a great <hi>humility,</hi> and a <hi>desire</hi> full of <hi>efficacy,</hi> renounce all the <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and give himself with all his heart to the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi> After all which he must yet have a great <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy</hi> upon the <hi>bottom</hi> and the <hi>dispositions</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> that with a great <hi>fidelity</hi> he may live in the subjection he ought to the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To help us in this <hi>practise,</hi> and to see how important it is; we must consider that the effect of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to one <hi>point</hi>: The <hi>designes</hi> of God upon our <hi>souls</hi> are reduced to one <hi>thing</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which it is their aim to <hi>effect</hi> in us. This point which God will do in us, is to establish his <hi>sanctification, glory</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> in our <hi>souls.</hi> This is the end of his <hi>design,</hi> whereto all the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>divine operations</hi> tend. Whence we may infer, that if God requires nothing of us, nor hath no other <hi>design</hi> on us, but to establish in our <hi>souls</hi> his <hi>empire</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:29616:71"/>
we also must have no other <hi>care, desire,</hi> or <hi>application,</hi> then to subject our selves to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God, to live in the obedience and conduct of his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> And as all the designs of God unite themselves in this one point, so the <hi>Christian</hi> must labour in this point, that he may be, in all, even to the least of his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and smallest <hi>motions</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> subjected to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God. Hereby I mean that all the <hi>motions, thoughts</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> must be ruled and subjected to the <hi>love, power, will,</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of God, that with peace and inward <hi>content,</hi> he must receive the <hi>effects</hi> of God, and walk with <hi>fidelity</hi> in the wayes God requires, that God may <hi>raign</hi> perfectly in him by his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and that he may raign here in all those wayes and manners, (that is, as <hi>gloriously</hi>) as he raigns with the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably notwithstanding to our present <hi>estate</hi> and <hi>meanness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not whether a true <hi>soul</hi> that hath true <hi>faith,</hi> can make this point hard to it self. I cannot believe that a <hi>Christian</hi> will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne this <hi>Truth,</hi> and lesse imagine that a <hi>soul</hi> it cannot arrive to the <hi>possession</hi> of a solid and <hi>Christian vertue,</hi> if she walk not by the <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>truths</hi> proposed, if she do not found her self upon this <hi>spirit.</hi> For

if we consider and believe that we are <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ, true,</hi> not <hi>imaginary</hi> members, <hi>not of a man,</hi> or <hi>Saint,</hi> but of <hi>Iesus Son</hi> of the <hi>living God,</hi> and that in this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we are truly and immediately <hi>united</hi> to him; if I say we consider our selves as such, do we not at the same time see, that we are <hi>united</hi> to God, and that by such an <hi>union</hi> we must be <hi>animated</hi> by his <hi>spirit, live</hi> by his <hi>life,</hi> and be governed by his <hi>conduct.</hi> This is the first <hi>condition</hi> whereunto we are <hi>raised</hi> by <hi>Christianity,</hi> the first <hi>grace</hi> we receive in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi> What <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> can that <hi>soul</hi> have, which lives not conformable to this <hi>estate?</hi> what doth that soul learn which knowes not his truth? To what end is the rest of our <hi>practise</hi> and this great fabrick of <hi>devotion</hi> which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to our selves, if we lay not this first <hi>foundation</hi> which is so necessary, that without it all the <hi>rest</hi> cannot <hi>subsist?</hi> If we have God for us; if we are <hi>united</hi> to him, as <hi>members</hi> to the <hi>head;</hi> yet if we are not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed</hi> as we ought to his <hi>infinite wisdom</hi> and <hi>loving conduct,</hi> why do we trouble our selves with all the <hi>rest?</hi> To what end so much <hi>care,</hi> so much <hi>prudence,</hi> and humane <hi>providence?</hi> To what end so many <hi>desires? He is too cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, whom God sufficeth not.</hi> What can a <hi>soul</hi> desire, to whom its God and Creator is

made <hi>all things</hi>? And if it cannot find rest in this, where can it find rest? <hi>What can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, who is not content with God,</hi> saith St. <hi>Prosper</hi>? Certainly that <hi>soul</hi> is very <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>miserable,</hi> which is not content with <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi> I demand all that you would have of humane <hi>prudence</hi> in all things, (we shall find but two many reasons to invite us) but a <hi>soul</hi> brought up in the knowledge of the <hi>truths</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and nourish'd in the <hi>esteem</hi> of God, will say with a holy person of our time, that <hi>the poor Doves are more pleasing to God then the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then raise our selves up to God, <hi>trust</hi> in him, adhere to his <hi>spirit,</hi> and beg light of him to penetrate into these <hi>truths,</hi> to bear the effects of them, and <hi>grace</hi> to live faithfully in his wayes.

in acquisition of <hi>Christian vertue,</hi> and <hi>possession</hi> of inward <hi>perfection</hi>; a manifest <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> the more damageable in that it <hi>dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi> from the honour of <hi>God,</hi> gives license to the <hi>world;</hi> and blinding their <hi>souls,</hi> looses them, and makes them slothfull in the search of the <hi>right way</hi> to <hi>salvation.</hi> To undeceive our selves then in a matter so <hi>important,</hi> and to secure our <hi>salvation,</hi> which otherwise would remain very <hi>doubtfull,</hi> we must <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> observe the <hi>obligations</hi> of these two <hi>estates,</hi> that by this <hi>knowledge</hi> we may know what we <hi>ought</hi> to be.</p>

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:29616:73"/>
she knows that by the <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> she enters into a <hi>profession</hi> which must sever her from the <hi>world,</hi> and whatsoever is in the <hi>world,</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> her to her <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>place</hi> her, if we may so say, in the <hi>bosom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> upon <hi>earth,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> live in <hi>heaven,</hi> to lead, in a holy <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> that <hi>God</hi> leads in his <hi>holiness,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>God;</hi> For as <hi>God</hi> is busied wholly in the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of himself, so the <hi>soul</hi> which desireth to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate</hi> her self, is not busied in <hi>Religion,</hi> but in a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>continuall</hi> contemplation of <hi>God,</hi> and in <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> which she doth with great <hi>care</hi> and <hi>vigilancy;</hi> For, for the <hi>soul</hi> to be as <hi>God</hi> would have her, and <hi>arrive</hi> to the <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> estate whereto <hi>God</hi> hath called her, must be <hi>accidentally,</hi> and by <hi>grace</hi> that which God is <hi>substantially,</hi> and by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> This is much in few words to extoll the <hi>Religious</hi> estate, and makes us see how <hi>holy</hi> it is whereto they are called.

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.48.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye perfect,</hi> saith he, <hi>even as your Father which is in Heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> What can be said more? or spoke in more express <hi>terms?</hi> How would we have more cleerly expressed what this <hi>perfection</hi> ought to be, then to say, you must be <hi>perfect</hi> as your <hi>heavenly Father</hi> is <hi>perfect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>perfection</hi> consists in the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and this <hi>union</hi> is <hi>made</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished</hi> by <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect love;</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> coming from <hi>God</hi> above, which alone hath <hi>power</hi> to give <hi>God</hi> to us, and to <hi>unite</hi> us to <hi>God.</hi> All <hi>Christians</hi> in generall, are called to the <hi>union</hi> which is made on <hi>earth</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> and in <hi>heaven</hi> by <hi>glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:29616:74"/>Whence I first infer, that as all <hi>christians</hi> are called to this <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> with God, so are all obliged to that <hi>love</hi> which makes this <hi>union,</hi> that is to say, to a <hi>love, pure, holy</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> of God, a <hi>love</hi> express'd and lively, represented by the mouth of God in these words,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note>

               </p>
               <p>I infer secondly, that the <hi>perfection</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the <hi>Religious</hi> are called, is not different from that whereto all <hi>christians</hi> are obliged, wherein many deceive themselves. The reason is <hi>clear,</hi> and the deduction of it is easie. For if <hi>perfection</hi> consists in the unity of the <hi>soul</hi> with God, an <hi>union</hi> wrought by true <hi>love,</hi> and all <hi>christians</hi> as well as the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> are called to this <hi>union</hi> made by <hi>grace</hi> upon earth, and in <hi>Heaven</hi> by his <hi>glory.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if it be commanded to all <hi>christians,</hi> and to all men as well as the <hi>Religious,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> God with all their heart, that is perfectly, and as much as they can in this mortall life by the ayd of <hi>grace,</hi> it followeth evidently, that these <hi>two estates</hi> which appear so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, are alike in the same <hi>obligation</hi> of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>perfection,</hi> though by different wayes.</p>
               <p>In fine, who can doubt so manifest a <hi>truth?</hi> no man can be ignorant that the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29616:75"/>
Commandement of Love is common to all men, of what estate soever they be. No man can deny but that <hi>Love is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> so St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it.<note place="margin">Col. 3.14.</note> There is no <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> then but in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> that we are to take, to arrive to this <hi>perfection.</hi> There are <hi>divers,</hi> and we must esteem <hi>all,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them with respect. But if it be a <hi>question</hi> to make choice of some <hi>way</hi> to arrive to this <hi>love,</hi> and if we must have <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Maxims</hi> to conduct us thereunto, and to conserve us therein, it is certain, we cannot find them more <hi>pure,</hi> more <hi>divine,</hi> and more <hi>assured</hi> then in the <hi>Gospel</hi> where the <hi>Son of God</hi> himself as <hi>Authour</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> showes us the <hi>way,</hi> gives <hi>us</hi> the <hi>rule,</hi> and proposes to us the <hi>maxims</hi> which we ought to <hi>keep,</hi> to <hi>guide</hi> us to this <hi>love</hi> which he commandeth, to live in this <hi>union,</hi> and to arrive to this <hi>perfection</hi> whereto we are called, and therefore <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> living according to the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> shall infallibly arrive to this high <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and enjoy this most desirable <hi>union.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of Christianity, <hi>In Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor incircumcision, but a new Creature,</hi> and <hi>as many as follow this rule, grace be unto them and mercy.</hi> Under the name of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> he teacheth us that nothing in the World, no estate is worthy to be esteemed but that of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29616:75"/>
a <hi>new Creature. Christianity</hi> onely, giveth us the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>power</hi> thereof; wherefore that is the <hi>rule</hi> whereof the <hi>Apostle</hi> here speaks. Whence we learn the <hi>eminency</hi> of the state of <hi>christianity</hi> above all others. We see then how true it is that we are all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, obliged and called of God to <hi>love</hi> and to <hi>perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This and more, which might be said on this <hi>subject</hi> is true; and yet notwithstanding it is certain, that <hi>christian perfection</hi> is as the Sun proposed to all <hi>christians</hi> in generall, the <hi>Precept of Love</hi> is equally given to all men, and consequently, all are obliged to the same <hi>perfection,</hi> which is all the <hi>Argument</hi> wherewith I would undeceive such <hi>christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> as would exempt themselves from <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This granted, it rests onely to consider the <hi>qualities</hi> of <hi>love;</hi> it must be <hi>pure, perfect,</hi> and <hi>indissoluble,</hi> the <hi>three properties</hi> of <hi>love</hi> in Christianity: <hi>Pure,</hi> for it regards nothing but God; if it regard any thing else, it is not for God, nor according to God, whence it comes, that that which regards <hi>pure love,</hi> doth <hi>separate</hi> us from our <hi>selves,</hi> from all our <hi>interests,</hi> and <hi>alienates</hi> us from all <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as far as they <hi>obstruct</hi> our <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>love</hi> makes us regard nothing but in the belief that God is there present by his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29616:76"/>
                  <hi>immensity</hi>; we neither <hi>tast</hi> nor <hi>feel</hi> them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then as they bear the <hi>presence</hi> of God; for God being in all things, the <hi>soul</hi> that loveth him, enclines to him, seeks him, and finds him every where. This <hi>love</hi> must also be <hi>perfect,</hi> God saith so expresly; <hi>We must love him with all our soul, and with all our strength:</hi> There is no need of <hi>explicating</hi> these words, they are too cleer, and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew us that God will have us <hi>love</hi> him <hi>with all that which we are,</hi> that is <hi>perfectly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>love</hi> must lastly be <hi>indissoluble</hi>; no <hi>force</hi> must <hi>separate</hi> us from God, no <hi>violence</hi> must <hi>tear</hi> this <hi>love</hi> from our <hi>hearts</hi>; no <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in <hi>heaven</hi> or <hi>earth</hi>; no <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> or of the <hi>loss</hi> of all we enjoy; no <hi>good,</hi> either <hi>present</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> must <hi>separate</hi> us from this <hi>love</hi> which must be in us <hi>more powerfull then death, more indissoluble then unity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now making use of all that we have said, and reducing to <hi>practise</hi> all the proposed <hi>truths,</hi> we shall find what we sought in this <hi>tract;</hi> we shall see that by a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, we are all obliged to <hi>divorce</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> our selves truly and strongly from all that hinders us from <hi>loving God perfectly.</hi> We are obliged to be <hi>perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> this <hi>perfection</hi> is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>true love of God</hi>; this love cannot be in us, but in as much as we are <hi>separated</hi> from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29616:76"/>
our <hi>selves,</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> and all <hi>Creatures.</hi> Whence we learn, that a Christian obliged to the <hi>love of God,</hi> and to <hi>perfection,</hi> cannot arrive to this <hi>estate</hi> which he seeks and is commanded him, if on the one side he be not wholly <hi>subjected</hi> to God, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether <hi>separated</hi> in <hi>spirit, conduct,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> from all the <hi>Creatures.</hi> Therefore he must apply himself earnestly to this exercise of <hi>subjecting himself to God,</hi> and devesting himself of himself; for it is certain, the soul can never acquire this <hi>divine spirit,</hi> nor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to <hi>Evangelicall perfection,</hi> if she stay in <hi>her selfe,</hi> obey her <hi>own will,</hi> and follow her <hi>own motions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>dwell in our selves</hi> is, to <hi>think</hi> of our selves, to <hi>take care</hi> of our selves, to <hi>have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall regard</hi> to our selves, and our self-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, to <hi>use the powers</hi> of our souls for our selves, and our own satisfaction, and not purely to please God. To <hi>love</hi> thus is to wear the <hi>maske</hi> and <hi>false appearance of vertue,</hi> but not to have the <hi>reality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these <hi>Principles of piety,</hi> it is easie to see, how dangerously they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who speaking of Religious souls, who are in a most pure and perfect estate, and according to the eminency of their <hi>vocation,</hi> say they ought to be night <hi>Christians,</hi> as Stars in the Firmament, and perswade others that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29616:77"/>
they are not obliged to the perfection of <hi>inward vertues,</hi> and that it is enough for them to become punctuall, and to live with order and fidelity in their <hi>exteriour conduct,</hi> making them believe that they are capable of no more; that this <hi>self-desertion</hi> is above their strength, nay that it were folly so to leave themselves to live in such a general manner of <hi>abandoning themselves.</hi> This is a manifest <hi>errour,</hi> for not onely the <hi>religious estate,</hi> but even that of <hi>Christianity,</hi> obligeth all <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to the <hi>practise</hi> of these <hi>vertues,</hi> seeing they are obliged to be <hi>perfect,</hi> according to the Commandement of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily appear by all the <hi>Motives</hi> handled in this second <hi>Part.</hi> Now if all they who aim at <hi>perfection</hi> in any profession whatsoever, must enter into this <hi>conduct of grace and subjection,</hi> if they must live devesting themselves to <hi>obey</hi> God more perfectly, and to live the life of God, which is the life of a <hi>true christian,</hi> the true life of <hi>grace;</hi> what ought those <hi>souls</hi> to do, who by <hi>particular graces</hi> and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements</hi> of speciall favour are <hi>called</hi> by God, <hi>cherished</hi> and <hi>inriched</hi> with his gifts? O how great will these <hi>obligations</hi> appeare to those that consider them? O how ought such <hi>souls</hi> to take care, and be <hi>vigilant</hi> to <hi>co-operate</hi> with the <hi>designs</hi> of God upon them, and to become faithful, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29616:77"/>
to the estate and <hi>fulness of grace</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them.</p>
               <p>This would require a long <hi>deduction,</hi> for nothing is of more importance, or needs a more ample <hi>discourse</hi> to content our spirits, and satisfie our piety. But it shall suffice that we shew the fundation and principles thereof; of which we shall now speak.</p>

                  <head>The conclusion of the second Part. The care and vigilancy which a <hi>Soul</hi> must have which seeks perfection, and would live in true subjection to the grace and conduct of Iesus Christ.</head>
                  <p>WE have cleerly enough <hi>deduced</hi> and <hi>demonstrated</hi> by divers <hi>motives,</hi> the <hi>obligation</hi> all <hi>Christans</hi> have to seek <hi>perfection,</hi> and wholly to <hi>subject</hi> themselves to the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; yet must we not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this <hi>Doctrine</hi> so generally, but that there is something more to be done, and that we fail not in our <hi>care</hi> and <hi>vigilancy</hi> to <hi>cooporate</hi> with the work of God in us, and to become faithfull to his <hi>conduct</hi>; and here we will shew what this <hi>care</hi> and <hi>vigilancy</hi> ought to be.</p>
                  <p>Let us first enter into consideration of the <hi>excellencies</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> that knowing it,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29616:78"/>
we may be ravished with its <hi>beauty, elevated</hi> and <hi>excited</hi> to conserve it carefully, in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> according to the <hi>designe</hi> of God upon us. This <hi>knowledge</hi> is not easie, for the <hi>soul</hi> is such a lively <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> and God hath <hi>invested</hi> her with so many <hi>lights,</hi> that our spirits are too feeble to sustain the beams thereof, and to <hi>penetrate</hi> the splendor of this <hi>beauty.</hi> If we will speak of her, we must say that she so perfectly represents her <hi>Prototype,</hi> God, that as we cannot better comprehend God, then in averring he is <hi>incomprehensible</hi>; so we cannot enter better into this <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>perfect beauties</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> then in saying, <hi>she cannot be known.</hi> For all that we can say of her, is below her, so neer doth she approach to the infinite greatness, and ineffable <hi>perfections</hi> of her <hi>Creator.</hi> The <hi>highest</hi> that we can say of her, that seems to imply the last draught of her <hi>perfection,</hi> is that she is a <hi>capacity of God,</hi> an <hi>Image,</hi> wherein the <hi>perfections</hi> of the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> are engraved; so as we may compare it to a <hi>Seal,</hi> wherein the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi> is perfectly and artificially cut: As the <hi>Seal</hi> is <hi>capable</hi> of receiving the soft wax applied to it, and imprints thereon a second <hi>Image;</hi> so our <hi>soul,</hi> which is the <hi>Image</hi> of God, is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of <hi>receiving God,</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> him once, she bears a continuall <hi>Image</hi> of him, his true
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29616:78"/>
                     <hi>resemblance.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> therefore, in as much as she is the <hi>Image,</hi> is also a <hi>capacity of God,</hi> since as the <hi>Image</hi> she is <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>receiving</hi> God. And this <hi>capacity</hi> is the ground of her being, and containing in it all her <hi>perfections</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> comprehending all that can be said of her.</p>
                  <p>It is not hard to <hi>penetrate</hi> this <hi>truth,</hi> if we consider the <hi>designs</hi> of God in the <hi>creation</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us that God alone is the <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> her <hi>fulness,</hi> that he hath <hi>created</hi> her to enjoy his <hi>greatness,</hi> to <hi>associate</hi> her into his <hi>glory,</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> to her his <hi>divine perfections.</hi> In pursuit of this <hi>designe</hi> it was, that he gave her so great an <hi>amplitude</hi> and <hi>capacity,</hi> that she cannot be filled but with God, which caused Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> to say, <hi>that our soul may be occupated by all things in the world, but that she cannot be filled with any but God, who created her for himself alone, to fill, to live in her, and to advance her to the enjoyment not of gifts, not of grace onely, but of glory, and of the essence of Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this <hi>begins</hi> upon <hi>earth,</hi> and is <hi>consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi> and <hi>perfected</hi> in <hi>heaven</hi>; indeed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>be</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> if it <hi>begin</hi> not upon <hi>earth,</hi> since the <hi>soul</hi> after <hi>death enjoyes</hi> but what she hath <hi>merited</hi> in her <hi>life,</hi> for we see that here <hi>below</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> receives her God by grace, she receives him in his loving <hi>communication,</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:29616:79"/>
and she is filled of God by his <hi>Spirit</hi> which dwelleth in her, and in <hi>Heaven</hi> she <hi>possesseth</hi> him fully by <hi>glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this <hi>possession,</hi> all her <hi>capacity</hi> is filled according to all Gods <hi>designes</hi> upon her. Thus Saint <hi>Iohn, We know that when he shall appear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>we shall be like to him, we shall see him as he is.</hi> Now, we cannot <hi>see God,</hi> and <hi>be like to him</hi> in glory, which is a <hi>pemanent</hi> estate without <hi>possessing</hi> him; and we cannot <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess</hi> him but in this <hi>capacity</hi> which is given us by God, which is the <hi>foundation</hi> of our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and all the <hi>perfection</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> so great a <hi>perfection,</hi> that we conceive it farther then we know the <hi>greatness</hi> of God. For as God is <hi>great,</hi> this <hi>capacity</hi> is <hi>great, ample,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.</hi> This deserves <hi>profound</hi> considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may serve to all men as a powerfull <hi>motive</hi> to <hi>sever</hi> themselves from <hi>all upon the earth,</hi> and to seek <hi>God only.</hi> for whom alone we are <hi>created,</hi> who alone is our <hi>fulness.</hi> This <hi>truth</hi> discovers the <hi>favour</hi> we receive from this infinite <hi>goodness,</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> being a <hi>capacity</hi> of God, as also continually regarded by him, who <hi>sees</hi> her; yea, he <hi>sees</hi> her, and he <hi>regards</hi> her to <hi>raise</hi> her to himself, to <hi>fill</hi> her, and fully and perfectly to <hi>possess</hi> her, in a manner <hi>worthy</hi> of God, and <hi>conformable</hi> to his <hi>love.</hi> He will be <hi>all things</hi> in this <hi>soul,</hi> he will be her <hi>life,</hi> her <hi>love,</hi> her <hi>good,</hi> her <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>All the World holds this for <hi>truth;</hi> yet we seem not to consider enough, what the meaning of <hi>interiour</hi> is, that onely the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> must be good, as many think and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; that it suffices in all things to have a <hi>good intention,</hi> and <hi>simple regard</hi> to the <hi>Action.</hi> But when we speak of the <hi>interiour,</hi> we mean the <hi>bottom of the soul,</hi> which is to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian actions life,</hi> as the <hi>Earth</hi> is to the <hi>fruits</hi> she produceth, and as the <hi>root</hi> is to the <hi>Tree,</hi> which it <hi>nourisheth</hi> and <hi>enliveneth.</hi> The <hi>bottom of the soul</hi> is the true <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of all our <hi>actions.</hi> By <hi>the bottom of the soul,</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a <hi>true and reall goodness</hi> which is in the <hi>soul,</hi> a pure <hi>intention</hi> that accompanies her; <hi>grace</hi> that assists her, <hi>necessary and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29616:83"/>
dispositions</hi> to the <hi>vertues</hi> which are in her, all <hi>this I call the bottom of the soul.</hi> What will it profit a man to practise an <hi>action</hi> of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>humility,</hi> and to do it with a good <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if <hi>in the bottom of his soul</hi> he hath a proud will? what doth it serve for in a <hi>Christian,</hi> to get the true <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>charity</hi> outwardly, to give <hi>alms,</hi> and be liberall, and <hi>in the bottom of his soul,</hi> to bear a heart pitiless and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous? It is certain, that after this manner, he shall never acquire <hi>vertue,</hi> though he had all the <hi>good intentions</hi> in the world; because the <hi>foundation of his soul,</hi> (which is <hi>the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour</hi>) is not good: the <hi>first</hi> thing he must do, is, to <hi>perfectionate</hi> the <hi>bottom of his soul,</hi> and to form his <hi>interiour</hi> after the manner proposed, to know the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>vertue.</hi> Let us propose a particular <hi>example</hi> of some <hi>vertue,</hi> as a <hi>rule</hi> for all the rest; we will take <hi>humility,</hi> which is necessary for all <hi>Christians.</hi> If we would acquire this <hi>vertue,</hi> and practise it, we must first know wherein it consists, that when we would produce the <hi>acts</hi> thereof, we may form them in the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour spirit</hi> of this <hi>vertue,</hi> conformable to our knowledge of it. For how can we practise a <hi>vertue,</hi> if we know it not? How shall we perform an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>humility,</hi> if we know not what <hi>humility</hi> is? We must then study to know the <hi>vertue</hi> that we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29616:83"/>
unless God himself incited by his <hi>bounty,</hi> give us the <hi>spirit of it,</hi> without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But speaking according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>wayes</hi> of the <hi>practise of vertues,</hi> we must <hi>know</hi> them, that when we would acquire them, by <hi>practise,</hi> we must endeavour to do the <hi>Acts,</hi> and accompany them with a <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must further yet put our selves into <hi>dispositions interiour</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> to the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> we would acquire, as in the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> it must be in an <hi>esteem</hi> of God alone, in a <hi>mean opinion</hi> of our selves, in a desire of <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> and to do this from the <hi>bottom of the soul.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> being in these <hi>dispositions,</hi> will endeavour to apply her thoughts thereto, when it shall be time to do any <hi>outward actions</hi> thereof. For example, If she do an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>outward humility,</hi> it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in <hi>her</hi> heart a thought and a sense of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and <hi>awaken</hi> in her some <hi>disposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this vertue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note> and so she will do this <hi>exteriour Act,</hi> by an esteem and pure desire of <hi>humility,</hi> with <hi>mean esteem</hi> of her self. To do an <hi>action</hi> after this sort, is that which I call to do it in the <hi>spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>dispositions of vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To see how necessary this is, we need no other Witness then <hi>Experience;</hi> no other Judge then <hi>Reason</hi>; for how can we (for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29616:84"/>
example,) get the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>humility,</hi> though we should perform infinite and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>acts</hi> of it, if we know not this <hi>vertue?</hi> and if in practising it outwardly, we reflect not upon <hi>it self?</hi> How can we conceive that a man can attain this <hi>vertue</hi> by any <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice</hi> whatsoever, if we bring <hi>contrary dispositions?</hi> It is evidently impossible. We must therefore take <hi>care</hi> to establish it in the <hi>dispositions</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> and first labour to form her <hi>interiour</hi>; for he that shall have an ill <hi>foundation</hi> in his <hi>soul,</hi> cannot produce good <hi>fruits.</hi> Can we acquire <hi>humility,</hi> if at the same time that we produce <hi>exteriour acts of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> our <hi>soul</hi> is filled with <hi>esteem of our selves,</hi> our <hi>spirit</hi> full of <hi>doubleness,</hi> our <hi>sense</hi> given to <hi>curiosity,</hi> our <hi>whole heart</hi> tyed to our <hi>proper interests?</hi> It is cleer, that in so doing, it will be an <hi>impossible labour.</hi> We must then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that to attain <hi>true Christian vertues,</hi> it is necessary to have <hi>inward care,</hi> (that is to say) that the first thing we must study, is <hi>to take care</hi> that the <hi>bottom</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> be <hi>good;</hi>

                  <hi>If the root be holy, so are the branches.</hi> Then we must labour to acquire the <hi>dispositions</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to accompany <hi>vertue;</hi> to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is to take the <hi>shadow,</hi> and to leave the <hi>substance,</hi> to bear the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> and to have the <hi>reality</hi> of <hi>vice;</hi> it is to pursue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and to take nothing but flyes.

many who think not thereon; For, we may averr, (not without <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>regret</hi> that a great number of <hi>souls shut the door of their hearts</hi> to God, <hi>oppose themselves</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his <hi>grace,</hi> and by consequence will never <hi>arrive</hi> to <hi>perfection,</hi> what pains soever they take, because they <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>disesteem</hi> the <hi>practices</hi> of true <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>slight</hi> them, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here too much to their own <hi>sense,</hi> to love themselves too much, and to seek too greedily their <hi>proper interests.</hi> This is that (to speak properly) which hinders them from <hi>resigning</hi> themselves to the <hi>conduct</hi> of God. Hence it proceeds, that by too much seeking after their own <hi>satistaction,</hi> their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> and the <hi>contentment</hi> of their <hi>spirit,</hi> they grieve <hi>the spirit of God,</hi> captivate <hi>grace,</hi> and lose <hi>themselves</hi> in seeking <hi>themselves</hi>; and in stead of <hi>uniting</hi> themselves to <hi>God,</hi> they <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> themselves from him, and (which is more to be feared) they go out of the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of heaven,</hi> and from the <hi>counsels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to follow their <hi>own will,</hi> their <hi>own desires,</hi> and their <hi>own conduct,</hi> to tye themselves to their <hi>own flattering affections.</hi> It is they must give remedy to their <hi>own mishap</hi>; Let us leave them, to speak to <hi>souls</hi> who will <hi>quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly</hi> to acquire the happy <hi>possession</hi> of <hi>vertues.</hi>

               <p>SInce the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> must be a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> a <hi>life</hi> representing the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> expressing in man the <hi>perfections</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> it followeth that the <hi>actions</hi> of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> proceeding from such a <hi>Principle,</hi> be <hi>great</hi> and suitable to such an <hi>estate,</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which dwels in it by the <hi>grace of adoption.</hi> And if the <hi>vertues</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> are so <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>rare</hi>; certainly the <hi>dispositions</hi> must be also <hi>great,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> to obtain them <hi>singular,</hi> and the <hi>practice</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; For as there is great <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>morall vertues</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the <hi>supernaturall</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> so must the <hi>practice</hi> hereof be <hi>different</hi> and <hi>extraordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wisest of the times past, gave <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> to form man, and instate him in the most <hi>perfect use of reason</hi>; they prescribed <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>overcome</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> the <hi>passions</hi> to the <hi>reasonable will,</hi> the most noble part of the <hi>soul.</hi> But all this considered, is no more then to make us <hi>perfect men,</hi> that is, <hi>very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>; but our business is to make our
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29616:86"/>
selves <hi>perfect Christians</hi>: and as it is much more to be <hi>Christians,</hi> then to be men (there being a great difference between them;) so the <hi>practises</hi> imposed for attaining these two estates, are different, <hi>one</hi> as much advanced above the <hi>other,</hi> as the state of a <hi>Christian</hi> is above that of a <hi>man,</hi> as <hi>grace</hi> is above <hi>nature.</hi> We must now build upon this <hi>foundation,</hi> and advance the <hi>edifice</hi> of <hi>Christian perfection</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>principles</hi> we intend to propose. Therefore we must speak and act as <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> not as <hi>Philosophers.</hi> I say then, to attain <hi>Christian vertues,</hi> we must before all things, have a great desire of <hi>Christian perfection,</hi> and a resolution to labour in the acquisition of <hi>true vertues,</hi> as much as is necessary, and as God requires of us. This desire must be <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious</hi> and <hi>permanent,</hi> from the bottom of our heart. It is good also to awaken if often, and to form acts thereof with <hi>application of spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first means to obtain <hi>vertue</hi> is <hi>prayer.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> that applies her self with <hi>perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> to <hi>prayer,</hi> cannot fail of the <hi>possession</hi> of <hi>vertue.</hi> Prayer is understood two wayes; first <hi>as a demand,</hi> as if we should say, that if we demand <hi>vertue</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.5.</note> he will give it us. <hi>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally.</hi> This <hi>Proposition</hi> is true in this sense; but this <hi>demand</hi> must be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29616:86"/>
accompanyed with these <hi>considerations,</hi> true <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>vertue, perseverance</hi> in <hi>prayer,</hi> a <hi>vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy</hi> to become faithful to the <hi>grace</hi> that God communicates to us; otherwise our <hi>demand</hi> will be <hi>without effect,</hi> our <hi>prayer</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>fruit.</hi> It is not sufficient for the <hi>soul</hi> that would be said to arrive at <hi>Christian perfection,</hi> to nourish in it self <hi>vertuous desires,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them of God, if she be not also care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to demand them <hi>as she ought,</hi> and if she doth not with <hi>vigilancy</hi> labour in the <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> of these <hi>vertues.</hi> God will have us co-operate with his <hi>grace,</hi> and put to our hand to do <hi>with him</hi> what he will <hi>operate in us</hi>; so that to obtain <hi>vertues,</hi> we must <hi>demand</hi> them of God, but in demanding them, we must <hi>labour</hi> therein. Thus we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>acquisition of vertues by prayer.</hi> This <hi>Proposition</hi> is built upon this truth, <hi>That we cannot have vertue unless God give it, and God gives it not,</hi> but with an intent that we should <hi>co-operate therein,</hi> and that we should labour on <hi>our parts,</hi> shewing in this <hi>co-operation,</hi> the <hi>fidelity</hi> of our souls. For this end hath God given us <hi>free will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another way of <hi>obtaining ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues by prayer,</hi> understanding by prayer <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> or as we say ordinarily, <hi>mentall prayer.</hi> The <hi>soul,</hi> which applies it self to this <hi>exercise,</hi> considering the <hi>greatness of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:29616:87"/>
the <hi>verities of Faith,</hi> the <hi>beauty and stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of eternall things,</hi> the <hi>inconstancy of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,</hi> the <hi>vanity of all in the World,</hi> easily apprehends the <hi>love of Truth,</hi> and a <hi>contempt of vanity,</hi> (two, <hi>foundations</hi> necessary to the <hi>perfections</hi> of a <hi>Christian life</hi>) the <hi>soul</hi> by this exercise, remaining united and tyed to <hi>God,</hi> receives the <hi>rayes</hi> of this <hi>divine light,</hi> which is the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> and if she <hi>persevere</hi> with <hi>fidelity,</hi> must at last be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this <hi>love</hi> which she so contemplates. By this means entring into the enjoyment of <hi>divine love</hi> (which is alwayes liberall of <hi>Communications,</hi>) she will infallibly receive the <hi>Vertues</hi> necessary for her, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with most <hi>pure gifts,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>greatness of God,</hi> who will give her more then sufficiently graces convenient for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the <hi>perfection of Christian Vertues:</hi> wherein appeares the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> of this manner of <hi>prayer,</hi> which <hi>elevates</hi> us to God, causes us to enter into a <hi>conversation</hi> with God, <hi>unites</hi> us to him, <hi>enlightens</hi> us, <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms</hi> us, and <hi>disposes</hi> us to the <hi>life of grace,</hi> and leads us to the acquisition and possession of <hi>true Vertues.</hi> Food is not so necessary to the life of the body, as this manner of <hi>prayer</hi> to the <hi>life of the soul,</hi> and the <hi>acquisition</hi> of <hi>Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second meanes to acquire <hi>Christian</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:29616:87"/>
vertues, is <hi>mortification,</hi> which is absolutely necessary to the <hi>soul</hi> that will live the <hi>life of grace,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Christianly.</hi> We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and intentively consider that we are all the <hi>Children of Adam,</hi> living his <hi>life,</hi> following the <hi>inclinations</hi> of the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> to be <hi>christian,</hi> is to be the <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> his life, wholly to follow the <hi>spirit, motions,</hi> and holy <hi>inclinations</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> into this <hi>state</hi> and <hi>new-being,</hi> we are put by <hi>Baptisme.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> 
                  <hi>As many of you</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ,</hi> meaning they are made like the Son of God; they are by <hi>grace,</hi> that which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is by <hi>nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth granted, it is easie to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the necessity of <hi>mortification.</hi> If to be <hi>christians,</hi> we must be <hi>re-invested</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, <hi>live of his spirit,</hi> and follow his <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> then to <hi>arrive</hi> to this happiness, we must uncloath our selves of the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and we must, to speak in the words of the <hi>Apostle, Put off the old man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and put on the new man</hi>; this cannot be done but by <hi>mortification,</hi> which is the more necessary, in that the <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> are as much different from those of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the Heaven is distant from the Earth. These two <hi>spirits</hi> are as contrary one to the other, as the <hi>animal</hi> is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29616:88"/>
to the <hi>spirituall,</hi> according to the Apostle, who saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note> 
                  <hi>The first man is of the earth earthy, the second man is from Heaven,</hi> and cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord together. Now to argue by the <hi>rule of contraries,</hi> we must say that to <hi>establish</hi> the one, it is necessary to <hi>annihilate</hi> the other; to plant <hi>good,</hi> we must root out <hi>evill:</hi> so he that would love <hi>christianity,</hi> that is, according to the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> must take away and mortifie the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> which are in all, alwayes contrary to <hi>Iesus Christ. The Son of God came into the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh 3.8.</note> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>to destroy the works of the Devill.</hi> The spirit of <hi>Adam</hi> is a sinner, and his <hi>inclinations</hi> are but <hi>concupiscences,</hi> works of the flesh, therefore is the Sonne of God come to destroy them. We must also labour and <hi>co-operate</hi> with him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy in us, and to root out of us, all that sin hath put in us, wherein <hi>mortification</hi> assists us.</p>
               <p>This that <hi>Divinity</hi> which we call <hi>mysticall,</hi> teaches us, which requires that a <hi>christian</hi> to arrive to that <hi>perfection</hi> whereto God calleth him, passeth through the <hi>purgative life,</hi> in the wayes of <hi>mortification, annihilation</hi> and <hi>resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> that by this exercise, the soul may purge and cleanse it self from all that is in her opposite to <hi>grace</hi> and the true <hi>possession of God.</hi> This <hi>Doctrine</hi> is founded on a Truth

               </p>
               <p>To comprehend this <hi>truth,</hi> we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we said, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is our <hi>All</hi>; whence it followeth, he is <hi>our humility, our love, our patience, our vertue</hi>; and he that shall <hi>possess him,</hi> shall <hi>possess all</hi> in him; He is the <hi>foundation,</hi> the <hi>treasure</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> of the <hi>soul;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> 
                  <hi>He is made unto us,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption.</hi> Who then would have <hi>wisdom, righteousness,</hi> and other <hi>vertues,</hi> let him <hi>adhere</hi> to <hi>Iesus;</hi> He that would <hi>acquire</hi> and <hi>possess perfection,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2 3.</note> let him <hi>possess Iesus,</hi> for in him, <hi>are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> explains this further,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> saying, <hi>The eternall Father giveth us his Son,</hi> and with him freely <hi>giveth us all things</hi>; by which words,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29616:91"/>
he not onely implies, that by his <hi>merits,</hi> by his <hi>grace,</hi> and for his <hi>love</hi> we have all, but moreover, that with <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> (note the <hi>energy</hi> of this word, with <hi>Iesus</hi>) we have all, <hi>possessing</hi> him we <hi>possess</hi> all; we must add, that if we do not <hi>possess,</hi> nor adhere to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> we cannot have true <hi>christian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth is not hard to conceive, if we consider the essence of <hi>christian vertue</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> which is the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> or <hi>Iesus</hi> himself living in us, and <hi>working in us that which is well pleasing in his sight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.21.</note> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. Our ordinary manner of speaking, teacheth us as much, for we say, <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>christian perfection,</hi> have their beginning in <hi>grace</hi> from whence they spring, and what goes out of a just soul, that we call <hi>grace.</hi> Now the <hi>soul</hi> cannot be in <hi>grace</hi> nor just, but by the habitation of the holy spirit, living and acting in her. So the Apostle, <hi>The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>which is given to us,</hi> whence we infer, that if to live in <hi>christian vertue,</hi> we must be in <hi>grace,</hi> and if <hi>grace</hi> be no other then the holy spirit, living in us and there acting, seeing the holy spirit is no other then the very spirit of <hi>Iesus,</hi> it followeth evidently, that to live christianly, we must possess true <hi>vertues,</hi> and to possess them, we must possess
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29616:91"/>
                  <hi>Iesus,</hi> and adhere to him, for <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> consists in this possession.</p>
               <p>Let us rise higher, and come to the source hereof, Faith teaches us, that in <hi>Adam</hi> we are devested of innocence, fallen from the state of grace and perfection, whereto we were destined by Creation, and by the first designes of God. By this fall we have lost for ever the vertues, graces, and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts, wherewith the infinite goodness of God had inriched and cloathed the first man. At the sight of this misfortune, God being moved, onely by his own goodness to be merciful to us, would raise us from this fall, and inrich us more then ever with his graces and heavenly favours; <hi>where sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,</hi> saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20</note> 
                  <hi>grace did much more abound.</hi> To raise us to this happiness, he would give us a new beginning of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> his onely Sonne <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who being made man by the mystery of the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is established Father and principle of that being and life of grace which should be in man. As we participate in sin of the evil of <hi>Adam,</hi> and are with him despoiled of all <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> adhering to him, as to our naturall principle, and have with him his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his nature. So adhering to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as to our <hi>Head,</hi> our <hi>new Principle,</hi> we participate of his <hi>being,</hi> of his <hi>spirit,</hi> of his

                  <hi>and grace for grace.</hi> From this <hi>being,</hi> deliberately consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we may derive worthy <hi>documents</hi> to our subject: First, we see how much we ought to <hi>adhere</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi> if we will <hi>live</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> and participate his <hi>vertues,</hi> which are the onely <hi>Christian vertues;</hi> for in as much as we <hi>adhere</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> we are not <hi>capable</hi> of any thing, but to <hi>live</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>sinners,</hi> we have no <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> to <hi>practise</hi> or <hi>possess</hi> any <hi>Chrstian vertue.</hi> If we will <hi>live</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and obtain <hi>power</hi> to <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>possess vertue,</hi> we must lay hold of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and to receive it of him, we must <hi>adhere</hi> to him; for we cannot <hi>possess</hi> him, but in <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering</hi> to him; wherein appeareth also the <hi>necessity</hi> of this <hi>adherence.</hi> From this <hi>truth,</hi> we draw a <hi>second document,</hi> how much they deceive themselves, who speak <hi>meanly</hi> and <hi>indifferently</hi> of true <hi>Christans,</hi> or of a thing <hi>proportioned</hi> to our <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>being</hi>; For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> we must <hi>put on the Lord Iesus Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> that is, the gifts of the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> in such manner, that we may be like unto him, in such a <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>perfection,</hi> that we may bear in us an <hi>expression</hi> and a <hi>lively image</hi> of the <hi>life</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:29616:92"/>
and <hi>vertues</hi> of <hi>Iesus. Christian vertue,</hi> is not animitation of the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> of a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> man, not of <hi>Adam,</hi> considered in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency</hi> and originall <hi>Iustice,</hi> to have <hi>vertues</hi> after this manner, were not much; it is a lively Image of the <hi>vertues</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> Man-God; or to say better, it is the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> it self of <hi>Iesus</hi> in man: As men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by their <hi>habits,</hi> so are true <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> from others, by these <hi>vertues</hi>; and these <hi>vertues</hi> are distinguished from all others (if there be any) by the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then appears the <hi>divinity</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>Christian vertues,</hi> they are the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> himself, according to which, the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, we are <hi>new creatures</hi>: As <hi>creatures</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> we must bear his <hi>Image</hi> which is <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>celestiall,</hi> not that of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>terrestriall,</hi> that is, our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> must not be of a man, but of God; <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> as <hi>different,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as <hi>heaven</hi> is distant from the <hi>earth,</hi> as unlike as <hi>Iesus</hi> is to sinfull <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, by these <hi>Principles,</hi> we learn (and it is that I would most perswade) that the way to obtain <hi>Christian vertues,</hi> the most powerfull means to arrive to <hi>perfection,</hi> is, to <hi>adhere</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi> to prostrate our selves frequently before the <hi>Throne</hi> of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29616:93"/>
to subject our selves to his <hi>soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to give our selves to him and to his <hi>vertues,</hi> to endeavour to be replenished with his <hi>spirit,</hi> to bear him in the bottom of our <hi>hearts,</hi> that as the <hi>centre</hi> is in the midst of its <hi>circumference,</hi> he may be in the midst of our <hi>hearts,</hi> as the <hi>centre</hi> of our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and our <hi>souls;</hi> We must look upon this <hi>practice</hi> as very <hi>important</hi> to the <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>adhering</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and <hi>possessing</hi> him, she shall <hi>possess</hi> all in him, and easily obtain all from him; a <hi>truth</hi> none can be ignorant of that do acquire <hi>vertues</hi>; We must have them in <hi>Iesus,</hi> and of <hi>Iesus,</hi> their onely principle, <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Prototype,</hi> upon whom we must mould our <hi>actions,</hi> and form our <hi>life</hi>; By him the eternall <hi>Father</hi> speaks to us; by him he teacheth us; In a word, by him he giveth us this <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>perfection,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> which is no other then <hi>Iesus</hi> living in us; <hi>He that hath the Son,</hi>

If you desire a more express practise, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it thus.

sense, more like <hi>Philosophers</hi> then <hi>Christians.</hi> Such persons by their <hi>discourse</hi> and <hi>conference</hi> study to destroy the maxims of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to establish humane prudence, and use their uttermost to abase <hi>vertue,</hi> and make it hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.

               </p>
               <p>There are, who will think that the <hi>soul</hi> may be deceived by this <hi>way,</hi> our <hi>spirits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too <hi>feeble,</hi> this <hi>way</hi> too <hi>eminent,</hi> and that it occasions a <hi>perpetuall</hi> combate in the <hi>spirit</hi>: As it is <hi>troublesome</hi> to a man to walk in <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> so it is <hi>hard</hi> for the <hi>soul</hi> to go this <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>hidden.</hi> But if we would <hi>learn</hi> it well, we must say the <hi>contrary,</hi> all other <hi>wayes</hi> are <hi>uncertain,</hi> and <hi>deceitfull, vertue</hi> alone is <hi>infallible,</hi> we shall never be <hi>deceived,</hi> if we stick to it.

               <p>If at any time the <hi>souls</hi> who take this <hi>way</hi> are <hi>deceived,</hi> it is in that they go out of it, and (being <hi>perswaded</hi> by the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>self-love,</hi> or the <hi>vanity</hi> of the <hi>humane spirit,</hi> which esteems it self in every thing) withdraw themselves from the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that of <hi>humane prudence,</hi> choosing to be <hi>guided</hi> by the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> of worldly <hi>vanity,</hi> rather then by the <hi>maxims</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>heavenly truth.</hi> Thus indeed they find themselves <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> and fall into <hi>misfortunes,</hi> not for having taken this <hi>way</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> but for having quitted it, and adhered to <hi>humane prudence,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>reason,</hi> which like an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> will lead us out of the <hi>way,</hi> unless we be aided by a <hi>supernaturall</hi> force, and guided by a more sure <hi>light,</hi> such as is this of <hi>faith.</hi> But to the <hi>soul</hi> that is <hi>faithfull,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:29616:101"/>
applying her self to the <hi>truths</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that seeks God with <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> there must necessarily arrive great <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> in <hi>christian perfection.</hi> We must not therefore <hi>condemn</hi> this way, and reject it as too <hi>high,</hi> too <hi>difficult,</hi> and too <hi>painfull</hi>; for it is the way that the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself hath left to his <hi>Church,</hi> and commanded all his <hi>children.</hi> But on the contrary, we must <hi>teach</hi> it every one, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating our selves to their several <hi>capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and giving them all the <hi>means</hi> to pursue it, without going out of it, least they be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> If we find here any <hi>difficulty,</hi> it is in our selves.</p>
               <p>There are two things in man which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his progress this way, one is <hi>esteem</hi> of himself, and of his own <hi>spirit</hi>; the other is the <hi>Love that he bears himself,</hi> and, for his own sake, to the <hi>Creatures.</hi> To pursue this way, and to make use of <hi>Faith,</hi> he must go out of himself, and renounce his own <hi>spirit,</hi> and raise himself above all <hi>Creatures,</hi> to adhere to <hi>truth,</hi> to believe and to make use of what he did believe; he must renounce his <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> his <hi>reason</hi> and his <hi>sense</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>annihilate</hi> them. If our <hi>reason, sense,</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the <hi>truth</hi> proposed to our <hi>belief,</hi> we must quit our reason and our sense, to unite our selves to the truth.

proposed, that the <hi>uncreated eternall word</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man; that God <hi>died; reason</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> oppose this <hi>truth; Reason</hi> cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the <hi>eternall God</hi> should make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self subject to <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>immortall</hi> submit himself to <hi>Death;</hi> yet to believe this, our <hi>Will</hi> moved by <hi>grace,</hi> notwithstanding the opposition of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>sense,</hi> must say, I will <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>adhere</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> proposed.

               </p>
               <p>Thus we are to understand that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> 
                  <hi>bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi> By <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>understanding</hi> which useth to command, is made captive and obedient to the <hi>Will;</hi> therefore the <hi>soul</hi> in the practise of <hi>Faith,</hi> goes out of her selfe, and no more obeys her <hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>sense,</hi> she no more regards her self, but the <hi>truth</hi> onely, which she embraces as her <hi>object,</hi> adhering and uniting her self thereto. Thus by <hi>Faith,</hi> the soul is elevated above her self, to be tyed and united to the eternall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>truth</hi> revealed and proposed to her.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To <hi>make use of faith</hi> and <hi>truths</hi> conceived, we must first consider <hi>what faith proposes,</hi> but we must consider it <hi>barely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> without any <hi>discourse</hi> upon it; we must <hi>adhere</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and having <hi>adhered</hi> to it, we must <hi>act</hi> and <hi>do</hi> all things in pursuit of this <hi>adherence.</hi> Let us propose an <hi>example</hi> in common things, to facilitate the <hi>practice.</hi> I <hi>look</hi> upon God, I <hi>consider</hi> his <hi>infinite essence</hi>; I see that in respect of his <hi>divine Majesty,</hi> all <hi>creatures</hi> are as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

               <p>I would form in my self the <hi>presence of God</hi> by the <hi>principles of Faith.</hi> Hereupon I will <hi>rouse</hi> up in my <hi>spirit</hi> the <hi>thought</hi> of that <hi>truth</hi> which teaches me <hi>God is present every where,</hi> and thence <hi>infer,</hi> that consequently <hi>he is in my heart,</hi> with the same <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> that he is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> amidst the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> for it is the same <hi>God.</hi> Having <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> this truth, I <hi>adhere</hi> to it, and say <hi>it is true</hi>; then making use of it, I find my self in the <hi>presence</hi> of God, who is in my heart; I hold my self before him in great <hi>reverence</hi>; I walk with <hi>recollection</hi> of spirit, and a sweet <hi>application</hi> of my soul to God who is present.

               <p>But wherefore all this, seeing it pertains to the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>prayer?</hi> let us leave it to them who treat thereof, and content our selves to conclude with that which <hi>we</hi> would perswade that the first thing that he must practise, who will live a <hi>perfect christian,</hi> is to <hi>live in the spirit,</hi> and to <hi>walk in the light of faith,</hi> and by this light to enter into an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem</hi> of God, which is supported upon the <hi>knowledge</hi> of his <hi>greatness,</hi> and of <hi>what he is.</hi> What <hi>course</hi> we must take to obtain this knowledge, we will proceed to speak of in the <hi>subject</hi> of <hi>Humility.</hi>

               <p>THe knowledge of <hi>truth</hi> consists in <hi>knowing God</hi> and <hi>our selves;</hi> a man may <hi>arrive</hi> at this <hi>knowledge</hi> two wayes, by <hi>infusion,</hi> by <hi>acquisition.</hi> The first comes from <hi>God</hi> alone, who <hi>communicates</hi> and <hi>infuses</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>soul</hi> a <hi>light</hi> springing from <hi>truth,</hi> which we call the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> This <hi>light</hi> brings and gives the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>our selves</hi>; and this <hi>knowledge</hi> as well as the <hi>light,</hi> is an <hi>operation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who by this <hi>divine light</hi> which he spreads in us, <hi>annihilates</hi> our <hi>soul,</hi> and in all <hi>things</hi> detains it wholly in this <hi>annihilation,</hi> wherein consists <hi>humility:</hi> Thus is <hi>humility</hi> a <hi>grace infused,</hi> and a <hi>pure ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of God alone; this <hi>operation</hi> is greater or lesser, according as God pleases, who by the <hi>communication</hi> of this <hi>divine light, consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth</hi> and <hi>annihilateth</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> more or less, as he pleases, for his glory. This first man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is for <hi>few persons,</hi> because <hi>few</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to this <hi>way, few</hi> render themselves worthy of such <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:29616:111"/>The <hi>second,</hi> and more <hi>ordinary</hi> is <hi>acquired.</hi> We propose divers means to acquire the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>of our selves,</hi> the most common and easie whereof, is <hi>consideration</hi> and <hi>application</hi> assisted by <hi>grace,</hi> without which nothing can be done. We arrive to the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> not by <hi>sublime penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> that is not necessary, and few are capable of it, but by <hi>faith.</hi> When the soul considers God as he is <hi>simple,</hi> proposed in the <hi>Creed</hi> to us, according to the <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> signification of the words, as <hi>all good, all wise, all mighty,</hi> this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is sufficient. Therefore we must accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom our selves to make use of that which <hi>Faith</hi> proposes, and after excite in our selves the thought of God, and entertain our selves therein, not by <hi>speculation,</hi> but by <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> which is that we call an <hi>affective thought of God,</hi> as if we should say in our hearts; <hi>yea my God, thou art wholly wise, and wholly good, I will leave my self to thy conduct, I will submit my self to thy divine will.</hi> By these frequent thoughts of God, the soul <hi>unites</hi> it self to God, <hi>adheres</hi> to his truths, and by little and little, <hi>ascends</hi> to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God. This manner is not hard, neither requires it any rule, we must onely be vigilant often to <hi>apply</hi> our selves thereto, when any thing gives <hi>occasion</hi> thereof. To arrive to the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29616:111"/>
of our selves,</hi> it suffices not, to consider our own impotency, our feebleness and our imperfections, we see them, and know them but too much, we make a custom of it, and this truth will never lead us to <hi>humility,</hi> but we must <hi>elevate</hi> our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and make use of the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> thus. The soul must present it self before God, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as well as she can the <hi>infinite being,</hi> and <hi>soveraign Majesty</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> before which she is, she regards him, she <hi>adores</hi> him; then she begins to <hi>compare</hi> her <hi>being</hi> with that of God, she <hi>entertains</hi> her self in this <hi>thought,</hi> and in this <hi>regard,</hi> and presently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the <hi>exaltation of the divine essence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her own,</hi> she accounts her self as if she were not, by reason of the infinite <hi>distance</hi> she sees betwixt God and her, and in this view she regards her self, rather in a <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and a nothing then in a <hi>being.</hi> The soul filling her self with this thought, and <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> with this <hi>truth,</hi> humbles her self in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of her <hi>nothing,</hi> and abases her self as much as she can. For having conceived the <hi>greatness</hi> of God throughout, she sees that she is a <hi>meer nothing.</hi> This <hi>truth</hi> annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates all <hi>creatures,</hi> yea the most <hi>perfect</hi> upon earth, and the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, forc'd by this principle, humble themselves, and make themselves <hi>as nothing,</hi> before the <hi>supreme</hi> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29616:112"/>
                  <hi>incomprehensible Majesty of God,</hi> in respect of whom <hi>all creatures</hi> together, are not so much as one <hi>grain</hi> of Sand. The soul in the sight of this truth, must say in her self; <hi>If all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are nothing before God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa 40 15.</note> 
                  <hi>what am I who am the least? And if I am nothing before God, can I make my self any thing? If before the Creator, I find not my self, by reason I am so much plung'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing, would I to the prejudice of truth, appear to be something before the Creature?</hi> In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this truth, the spirit is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, the soul knowes what she is, and is constrained to humble her self. We must passe farther, and enter into the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the totall and absolute <hi>dependance</hi> wherein the soul is in regard of God, a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> so <hi>great,</hi> that she holds onely of <hi>God,</hi> she <hi>subsisteth</hi> not, nor moveth but <hi>in</hi> God, with so much necessity, that the beames <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi> not <hi>by,</hi> nor depend more on the Sun, then the soul doth on her God: O happy <hi>dependance,</hi> which gives us God, and binds us to God! In considering this truth, the soul finds that she <hi>is nothing,</hi> and that she <hi>hath nothing,</hi> either in the order of the <hi>essence crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> or <hi>in the order of grace,</hi> for all is in God, and depend on God in such manner, that if God should wholly withdraw himself, she should leave to be that which she is, and should find her self in her <hi>nothing.</hi> So that if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29616:112"/>
she have any thing, she sees that it is in God, not in her self; <hi>in him</hi> saith St. Paul, <hi>we live and move,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and have our being.</hi> Reflecting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, she saith in her heart, <hi>If all that I have belong not to me, nor is of me, but of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God, then am I nothing, nor have any thing. Wherefore do I flatter my self, and believe my self to be something, when in truth I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? why do I glorifie my self, and please my self in that which belongs not to me? wherefore should I attribute to my self, the honour, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and glory, which belongs onely to my Lord? No no, I will keep in my meanness, I will hide my self in the abysse of my nothing, and if God be merciful unto me, and out of his</hi> bounty <hi>give me something, I will hold it of him, I will onely keep it for him, and I resolve from this time, and to all eternity, I will live in the dependance that I owe to the regard of my Lord and God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us not stay here, but advance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the <hi>light of truth,</hi> and let us cast our eyes upon the <hi>need</hi> we have of God, and we shall find what we are, and that we are <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> nor have <hi>nothing,</hi> as having received all of God, and we <hi>possess</hi> nothing, either <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi> or <hi>spirituall,</hi> in <hi>nature</hi> or in <hi>grace,</hi> but onely that which God reserves; and if he should be pleased to withdraw his gifts, or cease to preserve them, we should find our selves like <hi>Adam,</hi> naked and poor, and should return to our <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:29616:113"/>Let us behold our selves then so <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>devested,</hi> and let us pause upon this thought, and upon this consideration, and we shall be ashamed to look upon our selves, and we shall be forced, whether we will or not, to humble our selves, but with a <hi>humility</hi> full of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> which shall make us lift up our eyes to Heaven, to behold <hi>him</hi> on whom we so absolutely <hi>depend</hi> from whose hands we have received all, and must yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment receive <hi>influence, conduct, grace,</hi> and <hi>stability,</hi> and that so necessarily, that if we happen to separate our selves from him, and if he but stop his assistance and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, leaving us to our selves, we assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall fall, and in an instant lose all, in what state soever we are of <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> O most <hi>powerful Truth,</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> us if considered; a <hi>truth</hi> that <hi>humbles</hi> the most <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>just</hi> upon earth, and which <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Seraphims</hi> in Heaven, a truth which makes the <hi>glorious spirits, Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> who enjoy God, to acknowledge that they have nothing but of the mercy of God, and that they have no stability but in God; an acknowledgement so strong, that it were able to pluck them, and unite them to him indissolubly, if otherwise they were not ty'd to him by the state of <hi>glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the very state of a soul of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:29616:113"/>
who knowing the <hi>greatness</hi> of God, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself his Creature penetrating those truths by a light springing from the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union of the word, a <hi>light</hi> worthy of the <hi>glory of the Sonne of God,</hi> humbles it self but with a humility that shall be eternall, a <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> more profound then that of all the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> a <hi>humility</hi> which alone is worthy to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> the infinite <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and the supreme <hi>Majesty</hi> of God. So that these <hi>truths</hi> annihilating all the <hi>spirits,</hi> and humbling all the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> nothing but man shuts his eyes against so great a <hi>light. Iesus Christ</hi> and these <hi>Seraphims,</hi> humble themselves in the <hi>throne</hi> of their <hi>glory,</hi> and men glorifie themselves sitting on the <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> of their <hi>vices.</hi> O hardness and obstinacy of humane spirits! O the power of the <hi>blind ambition</hi> of men, who see and confess these <hi>truths,</hi> who bear the <hi>marks</hi> of them, who feel the <hi>violence</hi> of them, yet remain insensible, <hi>triumph</hi> in their wickedness, and <hi>refuse</hi> to act by <hi>love</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> what they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to do by <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>rigour,</hi> for those who <hi>exalt</hi> themselves shall be <hi>humbled,</hi> but <hi>humbled</hi> by the <hi>revengefull</hi> hand of <hi>Almighty</hi> God.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29616:114"/>
in us, and if we bear a true <hi>esteem</hi> of God. But we must proceed further, this <hi>desire</hi> must not be in the <hi>mouth</hi> onely, but in the <hi>heart</hi>; to be <hi>pure,</hi> it must regard nothing but God, to be <hi>perfect,</hi> it must be <hi>infinite</hi> without <hi>limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>restriction,</hi> as if we should say, <hi>I will be Gods in all that he wills,</hi> and in sign of the <hi>perfection</hi> whereinto I desire to enter, I will know <hi>nothing</hi> of all that he <hi>desireth</hi> of me, I <hi>content</hi> my self to be in a bare abandoning of my self to all the <hi>thoughts,</hi> all the designes, all the <hi>Counsels</hi> he hath formed of me in the Cabinet of his <hi>eternall wisdom,</hi> to all the <hi>thoughts Iesus Christ</hi> had of me on the <hi>Altar</hi> of his <hi>Crosse,</hi> sacrificing himself to the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and offering vvith himself the <hi>souls</hi> of his <hi>Elect.</hi> I offer my self to him to be all that he vvill, and to leave all the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>divine pleasure,</hi> be it of <hi>Iustice</hi> or of <hi>love</hi> of <hi>abandoning</hi> or <hi>enjoying,</hi> of <hi>abundance</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> of <hi>fervour</hi> or of <hi>drought.</hi> In brief, I will have no other desire but to be <hi>Gods,</hi> to be all that <hi>he will,</hi> that I should be.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>adorable</hi> estate into which the <hi>soul</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> entred the first instant of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as soon as it was united to the <hi>Word,</hi> for in the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his <hi>soul</hi> produced an act of <hi>obligation</hi> of him to be wholly Gods, wholly obedient to his <hi>divine decrees</hi> in all the wayes which he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29616:115"/>
ordained upon him, and upon his <hi>life,</hi> in the wayes of <hi>humiliation,</hi> of <hi>sufferings,</hi> of <hi>privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cross</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> This is also the <hi>estate</hi> and first <hi>disposition</hi> whereinto the <hi>soul</hi> must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that seeks God, and will <hi>live Christianly</hi>; but she must remain herein with such <hi>stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>constancy,</hi> that she may render her self <hi>immutable,</hi> in regard of his <hi>disposition</hi>: For in whatsoever <hi>change</hi> she finds her self, she must never quit this <hi>disposition</hi>; on the contrary, it is herein that she must <hi>establish</hi> and <hi>settle</hi> her self more and more, and all her <hi>care</hi> must be, to bear it, not in her <hi>mouth,</hi> nor in her <hi>will,</hi> but in the bottom of her <hi>heart,</hi> and centre of her <hi>soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have said, that this <hi>desire</hi> to be God's, must be <hi>pure, simple, naked,</hi> and <hi>absolute</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to forme this <hi>desire</hi> and make it <hi>perfect,</hi> we must not <hi>receive</hi> into our <hi>spirit,</hi> any <hi>reason,</hi> any <hi>consideration,</hi> any <hi>interest,</hi> but onely say, and say it truly, <hi>I will be Gods for Gods sake,</hi> according as God will have me, and in such manner as shall <hi>please</hi> him.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Disposition</hi> thus <hi>explained,</hi> teaches us, that they who seek <hi>Christian perfection,</hi> and faithfully <hi>resign</hi> themselves to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> in the state that <hi>pleaseth</hi> him, must not <hi>desire</hi> to know or understand what God will do with them, nor what he will say to all the <hi>motions</hi> which they <hi>think,</hi> or in all that they

               </p>
               <p>To <hi>facilitate</hi> this, it is good for the <hi>soul</hi> to present her self often before God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing in her self an <hi>efficacious desire</hi> to do the <hi>pure</hi> will of God, and to do it in the <hi>dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and manner that he requires, without <hi>knowing</hi> what he will, and she shall often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her self to <hi>God</hi> for this end.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is very <hi>profitable</hi> to offer our selves to God, and to form a generall <hi>will</hi> to <hi>practise</hi> all sorts of <hi>good,</hi> though we have no <hi>light</hi> nor <hi>feeling,</hi> contenting our selves with a <hi>resignation</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and taking <hi>care</hi> to follow him, and to <hi>co-operate</hi> faithfully with the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> we receive from him.

not seek any <hi>sense,</hi> any <hi>light,</hi> nothing of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> but keep and conserve it self in a <hi>pure estate</hi> to be Gods, to do his <hi>divine will,</hi> and to render her self <hi>faithfull</hi> to his <hi>graces,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, that we have nothing to do in this <hi>world,</hi> but to submit to the <hi>will</hi> of God, to receive his <hi>gifts,</hi> and to render them again unto him.</p>

his <hi>love?</hi> We must believe God will require in us a <hi>purity</hi> worthy of God, seeing he who is <hi>purity</hi> it self, will <hi>dwell eternally</hi> in us. This <hi>purity</hi> that God demands, and whereof he is worthy is so <hi>divine,</hi> that our <hi>strength</hi> cannot arrive unto it, he must give it, he must assist our <hi>importance;</hi> there is nothing but the fire of his <hi>love,</hi> the lightning of his <hi>light,</hi> the force of his <hi>grace,</hi> and the power of his <hi>spirit</hi> that can <hi>purge, expiate,</hi> and <hi>consume</hi> all in us that is contrary to this <hi>purity.</hi> In brief, it belongs to God alone to place us in the <hi>purity</hi> that he requires of us: This shews how much those <hi>souls</hi> are deceived, who think to <hi>possess</hi> God, and <hi>be well with him,</hi> yet are more <hi>remote</hi> from him then <hi>heaven</hi> is from <hi>earth.</hi> We need not but to behold and judge by the <hi>effects,</hi> what its <hi>cause</hi> is. Now, as this <hi>purity</hi> is altogether necessary to possess <hi>God,</hi> so it is our part to <hi>desire</hi> and to <hi>demand</hi> it of him, and our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>care</hi> must be to <hi>purify</hi> our <hi>heart,</hi> to make it to bear God, we must <hi>offer</hi> it to him, that we may bring to our selves the <hi>effect</hi> of this saying of God to his <hi>Spouse,</hi> and to all others; <hi>My son, give me thy heart,</hi> we must <hi>give</hi> and <hi>resigne</hi> it to him alone,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.26.</note> it is his <hi>desire,</hi> it is our <hi>duty,</hi> and our <hi>happiness,</hi> if he will vouchsafe to <hi>accept</hi> it, it will be his when he <hi>pleaseth</hi> to make it such as he <hi>requires</hi> it.

               <p>The <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>two wayes;</hi> one, that we must <hi>purifie</hi> our <hi>heart</hi> from all sorts of <hi>sins,</hi> and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>imperfections.</hi> God enters not into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>soul,</hi> nor inhabits in a <hi>body</hi> enslav'd to <hi>sin;</hi> we mean, not only gross <hi>sins,</hi> but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>failings,</hi> even all <hi>faults,</hi> be they never so little: For, <hi>God</hi> being <hi>purity</hi> it self, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>inhabit</hi> in a <hi>heart,</hi> if he find not, or put not therein this <hi>purity;</hi> and being <hi>infinitely good,</hi> he infinitly hates <hi>evil,</hi> whatsoever it be, and though the least <hi>faults</hi> drive not <hi>God</hi> out of our <hi>souls,</hi> yet they make a <hi>division</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> they make great <hi>spoil</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> they <hi>undermine it,</hi> they <hi>brand</hi> it, they <hi>indispose</hi> it; and being so, it is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable</hi> to God, and becomes the <hi>object</hi> of his <hi>Iustice.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> that knowes how to <hi>esteem</hi> of God, and bears any <hi>impression</hi> of his <hi>purity,</hi> will think more then I say, and never <hi>consent</hi> to the least <hi>imperfection,</hi> all is <hi>insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable</hi> to her that she knows to be <hi>disac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> to God, she hath no consideration of <hi>estate, honour,</hi> her own <hi>good;</hi> or of men, where she sees there is any thing <hi>capable</hi> to <hi>offend</hi> the <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> of her <hi>God</hi>; all her

                  <hi>care</hi> is to <hi>detest</hi> and <hi>extirpate,</hi> not onely the least <hi>faults,</hi> but to <hi>quit, renounce</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> her self from whatsoever she knowes to be displeasing to God. It is the chief advice of St. <hi>Augustine; Before any work,</hi> saith he, <hi>be sure to purify the heart, and take from it all that you observe displeasing to God.</hi> When he would have us take from our <hi>hearts</hi> all that is <hi>displeasing</hi> to God, he <hi>discovers</hi> a great <hi>secret;</hi> he would have us go out of our selves, and take out of us all that is of <hi>Adam</hi>; he would have us <hi>annihilate</hi> our <hi>inclinations,</hi> because whatsoever is of <hi>Adam,</hi> is <hi>impure,</hi> and opposite to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and ever contrary to him; whence we conclude, that he who would possess <hi>Iesus,</hi> must do all he can possible, to dispossess <hi>himself</hi> of, and to drive away <hi>Adam,</hi> this <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his <hi>inclinations</hi> can no more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the <hi>soul</hi> with the <hi>spirit</hi> of God, then the Idol <hi>Dagon</hi> could stand before the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> All that is in us, and is not of God is <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> of God, and all that is out of God, can <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> no <hi>good,</hi> nor any thing <hi>worthy</hi> of God; these are great <hi>truths,</hi> such as might <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> our <hi>spirits,</hi> yet let us not be <hi>astonish'd</hi> at this <hi>Proposition</hi> as too <hi>high</hi> and impossible, and we shall see that therein is nothing too much, but rather far less then so worthy a

                  <hi>subject</hi> merits, if we consider how <hi>pure</hi> that <hi>soul</hi> must be that would please God, <hi>be</hi> in God, and <hi>possess</hi> God, and what <hi>purity</hi> it must have to be one with God, for thereon the life of a <hi>Christian</hi> happily terminates. O great God, how many deceive themselves! O God of <hi>adorable purity,</hi> how few are fit to <hi>possess Thee!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>light</hi> of these <hi>truths</hi> we may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the abuse and deceits in <hi>christian devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Some think that they hold God by the hand already, and believe themselves well advanced in <hi>perfection,</hi> in that they <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> in that they <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> every day, and a thousand such like things, wherein they exercise themselves, they have the <hi>taste</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> they speak well of God, and if you will believe them, they say they are <hi>ravished</hi> in God. But consider them well, you shall find they <hi>live</hi> wholly according to their own <hi>inclinations,</hi> they mind onely their own <hi>Interest,</hi> they care onely to <hi>satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> in a word, they are but <hi>themselves,</hi> and full of <hi>self-love,</hi> you shall know these <hi>Trees</hi> by their <hi>fruits,</hi> and the end will let you see, that do but touch these <hi>Mountains,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will come out but <hi>smoke.</hi> God dwells not with <hi>Baal</hi>; let us not go <hi>two wayes,</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> who will <hi>possess</hi> God, who is <hi>purity,</hi> must be <hi>pure,</hi> must <hi>purge</hi> and <hi>take</hi> from it self, all
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29616:119"/>
that <hi>displeases God,</hi> for <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> possess not <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another <hi>deceit</hi> whereto we must take heed, which is of those that believe they <hi>do much,</hi> and think that God is <hi>endebted</hi> to them, when their <hi>Conscience</hi> troubles them not with any <hi>deadly sin,</hi> that is, when they themselves say they avoid them all for that, according to the <hi>truth</hi> of this <hi>proposition</hi> sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply taken, it is certain, he who dies without <hi>mortall sin,</hi> shall be a Saint. But laying aside many things that may be said against this <hi>abuse,</hi> I will onely make it <hi>appeare,</hi> that they <hi>support themselves</hi> upon a <hi>Reed,</hi> for I advise all those <hi>souls</hi> that speak so, to acquaint themselves with their own <hi>state,</hi> because that to know the <hi>state</hi> of our <hi>Consciences</hi> and our <hi>faults</hi> as they are, we must know what they are before God, and by the light of God. We cannot have this knowledge, but in as much as we are filled with the light of <hi>truth,</hi> and as we esteem God and his greatness: But if we did <hi>esteem</hi> God, and <hi>acknowledge</hi> his <hi>greatness,</hi> and if we did <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>truth,</hi> we would never speak thus. On the contrary, we should not onely <hi>shun</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>sin,</hi> but even the least <hi>faults,</hi> for <hi>knowing</hi> God, and <hi>esteeming</hi> his greatness, we love him, <hi>loving</hi> him, we <hi>fear</hi> to do any thing that may displease him, be it never so triviall, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29616:119"/>
they therefore who onely regard and fear the <hi>grossest sins,</hi> and care not for the rest, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly, neither <hi>know</hi> nor <hi>esteem God.</hi> They <hi>know</hi> him not, for they cannot <hi>know</hi> the state of their <hi>Consciences,</hi> and consequently, they <hi>deceive</hi> themselves when they ground their <hi>assurance</hi> on a <hi>pretence</hi> that they are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with <hi>mortall sins,</hi> and that so much the more in that they <hi>care</hi> not for all the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they are well <hi>assur'd</hi> of their <hi>salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Alass, who is he that can be assured he is worthy of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate?</hi> what <hi>presumption</hi> is it in men of this age, to <hi>assure</hi> themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst so many dangers? Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Sanctity</hi> said of himself, <hi>I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by my self, yet I am not hereby justified</hi>; and elsewhere he sayes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4</note> 
                  <hi>that he runs and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours alwayes, because he is not arrived to that perfection God requires of him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note> We must say the same in what state soever we are. Whence I conclude, that to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>purity</hi> that God requires of a <hi>Christian,</hi> he must not onely <hi>shun</hi> all <hi>sin,</hi> but further have a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>care</hi> and particular <hi>vigilance</hi> to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which may <hi>displease</hi> God, whatsoever it be, and must neglect nothing conducing thereto; and herein consisteth <hi>purity</hi> in the first sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Purity</hi> taken in the second manner, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no other thing then a <hi>pure regard</hi> of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29616:120"/>
man to God, be it for the <hi>soul</hi> or for the <hi>body.</hi> This <hi>purity</hi> is greatly <hi>important,</hi> and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>necessary</hi> to those who would <hi>live</hi> as <hi>perfect Christians,</hi> by this <hi>purity,</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards onely God, she doth nothing but in the sight of God, she seeks nothing but his <hi>Will,</hi> if she <hi>love,</hi> it is onely God, if she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any thing else, it is onely for God, and according to <hi>God,</hi> in every thing <hi>she seeks</hi> his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>satisfaction,</hi> all <hi>creatures</hi> are before her, as if they were not; in this consists the <hi>essence</hi> of this <hi>vertue.</hi> Perhaps we shall make it better known by <hi>proposing</hi> the <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> whereby we may arrive to the <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of so <hi>divine</hi> a <hi>vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first I place in <hi>purity and simplicity of intention,</hi> when the <hi>soul</hi> in all that she does, <hi>annihilates</hi> all her <hi>intentions,</hi> her <hi>desires,</hi> her <hi>motions,</hi> her <hi>thoughts,</hi> and admits none but the <hi>pure desire</hi> of <hi>complying</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> I call this <hi>intention</hi> simple, because it must be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> without consulting <hi>Reason</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. This <hi>intention</hi> is simple, because it is one wholly, and alwayes equall in all things, it <hi>regards God</hi> onely, and him <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi>; in brief, this <hi>intention</hi> and regard is simple, because it onely rests upon <hi>God</hi>; the <hi>soul</hi> that seeks this <hi>vertue,</hi> seeks onely <hi>God.</hi> O how desirable is this <hi>vertue!</hi> how happy is this manner of life! This is that which
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29616:120"/>
                  <hi>unites</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> that which pleaseth <hi>God,</hi> and is fit to bear <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second meanes to arrive at the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> of this <hi>vertue</hi> is, by <hi>denying our selves,</hi> when we renounce our selves, and admit no <hi>resentment</hi> that beares <hi>impurity</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> to our selves or the <hi>creature,</hi> as the <hi>esteem</hi> of our own <hi>merit,</hi> of our <hi>capacity,</hi> of our <hi>vocation,</hi> the content of a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> the profit of <hi>Friends,</hi> the acquisition of <hi>Vertue</hi> and such other things that cause us to stray from <hi>God.</hi> We must <hi>annihilate</hi> all these <hi>resentments</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> to persist in the <hi>unity</hi> and bare sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the <hi>pure regard</hi> of God; the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of God, <hi>his glory</hi> and <hi>his content</hi> is a thing more <hi>important,</hi> and <hi>infinitely</hi> of more worth then can be imagin'd, yea, then the <hi>salvation</hi> of all men. The <hi>soul</hi> therefore that seeks <hi>God</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> (for that is all one) must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take heed to this manner of <hi>purity,</hi> for to <hi>regard</hi> any thing but God, and to <hi>love</hi> out of God, is to <hi>love</hi> unworthily, and to <hi>love</hi> any other thing with God whatsoever it be, to think thereon, to seek it, and to care for it, is to make too little <hi>account</hi> of God, it is to <hi>esteem</hi> his <hi>love</hi> too meanly. Men addicted to this <hi>World,</hi> will passe over this <hi>lightly,</hi> and perhaps with <hi>contempt,</hi> but I wish all that heartily seek God, and are in the number of those whom God holds in his <hi>hand,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29616:121"/>
to all <hi>eternity</hi> with a regard of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good will,</hi> that they think of what <hi>worth</hi> this eternall <hi>regard</hi> of God is, who <hi>regards</hi> us without ceasing, that they consider what God deserves, and demand of God that which he <hi>pleases</hi> for this regard of his <hi>love</hi>; I am confident that these <hi>thoughts</hi> would lead them to <hi>true piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third meanes to attain this <hi>Vertue,</hi> is <hi>vigilancy,</hi> whereby we take heed to that which God does in us, to correspond faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the <hi>designes</hi> he hath to <hi>purifie</hi> us, for by this <hi>vertue</hi> he is infused, and God by his <hi>operations</hi> incessantly <hi>purifies</hi> us. It is the duty of the <hi>soul,</hi> to watch the occasions that God giveth her, I say to <hi>watch,</hi> for the <hi>love</hi> of our selves is very cunning to separate us from God, and to apply us to our <hi>senses,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>necessity.</hi> The <hi>devout soul</hi> must seriously take heed, least she <hi>destroy</hi> in her self the <hi>works</hi> of God. This is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of <hi>Satan,</hi> they are his ordinary <hi>subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that deceive the most <hi>fervent,</hi> by this meanes, <hi>destroying</hi> in them all that God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi> It requires a very quick <hi>sight</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive these <hi>snares,</hi> and a great <hi>vigilancy</hi> to correspond with the <hi>work</hi> of God, and to act with the <hi>purity</hi> of God, for to this point it must arrive. To this <hi>end</hi> will contribute much the second means we have proposed,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29616:121"/>
which makes us <hi>renounce</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> and <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate</hi> in <hi>us</hi> all regard to the <hi>Creatures,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> alone may be the <hi>object,</hi> the <hi>hope,</hi> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi> and the whole of our <hi>soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>brightness</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of this <hi>vertue,</hi> will hurt their <hi>eyes,</hi> who too much love <hi>themselves,</hi> for they must <hi>quit</hi> all to <hi>possess</hi> it, they must have neither <hi>heart</hi> nor <hi>eyes</hi> for <hi>themselves</hi> or the <hi>creatures,</hi> and this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digest, who esteem <hi>themselves</hi> perfect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and think they hold <hi>God inchain'd</hi> by the <hi>chains</hi> of their <hi>devotions,</hi> which they <hi>love</hi> even to <hi>idolatry,</hi> despising and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>vertue</hi> which gives us <hi>God,</hi> out of an opinion that they already possess him. The sloathful will not regard it, because it exacts two much <hi>care</hi> and <hi>vigilance,</hi> it is for them who <hi>love God,</hi> or who seriously desire to <hi>love</hi> him, to esteem this <hi>vertue,</hi> and to seek it fervently; for where love is, there the eyes are, and we desire not to <hi>please</hi> but where we love. Let us <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> shall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>difficult.</hi> Is it not an intolerable <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> to see so many <hi>refusalls</hi> as <hi>we</hi> make to so great a <hi>happiness,</hi> and to make difficulties, <hi>when</hi> God <hi>will</hi> love our <hi>souls, when</hi> he <hi>will</hi> replenish them <hi>with</hi> himself. He <hi>will provide</hi> for them, he <hi>will conduct</hi> them, therefore he <hi>will separate</hi> them from themselves and the <hi>Creatures,</hi> that the <hi>heart</hi> may be <hi>pure,</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29616:122"/>
fit to receive him who is <hi>purity</hi> it self? O <hi>soul</hi>! saith Saint <hi>Cyprian, If thou suffice God, let God suffice thee, if God love thee, love thou him, if he regard thee, do thou regard him.</hi>

be done by <hi>self-deniall,</hi> whereby the <hi>soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth</hi> the <hi>creature,</hi> and <hi>annihilateth</hi> in her self all that she is.

               <p>Let us consider this first <hi>truth,</hi> by the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of <hi>faith</hi>; Since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> we are not <hi>sanctified,</hi> but by, and in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> we cannot be <hi>sanctfied</hi> as <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> but as <hi>members of Iesus Christ, and as the new creature in Iesus Christ.</hi> This <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> granted, it follows, that if we will take part with <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>holiness,</hi> and be <hi>sanctified</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> we must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>renounce</hi> our selves, and <hi>cease</hi> to be to our selves, that we may be to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which cannot be but by <hi>self-deniall.</hi> This was the <hi>state</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at his <hi>conversion,</hi> and the <hi>sense</hi> of his words,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> when he sayes, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> Thus we must understand these words of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, directed to all <hi>Christians:</hi>

                  <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself;</hi> wherein appears how necessary this <hi>vertue</hi> is to all <hi>souls</hi> that would follow <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and turn to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>self-deniall</hi> is the <hi>centre</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> Let us consider it from it's <hi>birth,</hi> and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29616:124"/>
we shall find, the <hi>Son</hi> of God founded his <hi>Church,</hi> accomplished our <hi>Redemption,</hi> and will save the World by the wayes of <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> The whole life of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and the <hi>Crosse,</hi> the preaching of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the propagation of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Conquest of the <hi>World,</hi> have been onely effected by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement of the <hi>Word</hi> into our humanity, by <hi>annihilating</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in all his <hi>works,</hi> and by the grace of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but debasement, as shall be said else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Whence it comes, that all <hi>Christians</hi> who would participate of this <hi>grace,</hi> who subsist in the bosom of the <hi>Church,</hi> and desire to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> must resolve to enter into this way of <hi>abnegation,</hi> and <hi>annihilation,</hi> in regard that all the <hi>life,</hi> and all the <hi>grace</hi> they can hope is in the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> flowing from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> of whose <hi>fulness</hi> we have all <hi>received.</hi> If this <hi>life</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> flow from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> it must be conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his <hi>life,</hi> it must bear his <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>properties,</hi> as the River hath no water but that of the source, leaving the <hi>tast</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi> thereof. So all our <hi>graces</hi> being of <hi>Iesus,</hi> as their <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Principle,</hi> they must necessarily be all <hi>conformable,</hi> and like to him.

Let us ascend to the <hi>source</hi> of this <hi>Truth.</hi> Consider, that as God hath created so many and so different <hi>creatures,</hi> for the beauty of the materiall <hi>World,</hi> so in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>grace,</hi> he hath made different wayes to come to him, one <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>Angels,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>man,</hi> another for his <hi>Sonne,</hi> who by the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> became capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>grace,</hi> but of a <hi>grace</hi> proportion'd to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29616:125"/>
the order and state of his <hi>incarnation</hi>; that of the <hi>Angels</hi> is not for us, that of men was lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> there resteth no other for us then that of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whereby he repaires and sanctifies us. Now as this <hi>grace</hi> is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and neerer to God, because made for <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> God and man, not for men, it followes, that they who will <hi>participate</hi> of it, must be <hi>elevated</hi> above their first <hi>capacity,</hi> and be <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to be by him <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to God. Thus the <hi>grace</hi> that sanctifies us is by a <hi>holy Iesus,</hi> worthy and proportioned to the greatness of <hi>Iesus,</hi> infinitely <hi>elevated</hi> above our <hi>being</hi> and <hi>capacity.</hi> If then we would <hi>participate</hi> of this <hi>grace,</hi> we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be <hi>elevated</hi> to an union with <hi>Iesus,</hi> forced above our own <hi>capacities,</hi> to be made capable to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> this <hi>grace.</hi> If I would arrive to this <hi>union</hi> and <hi>capacity,</hi> I must go out of my self to be <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> I must die to my self to live in <hi>Iesus.</hi> This is the work of <hi>self-denyall</hi> and <hi>annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> this is the effect of <hi>grace,</hi> for one is not without the other, no more then the <hi>effect</hi> can be without the <hi>cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>point</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, when he calls <hi>christians, Sacrifices,</hi> to shew that the state of <hi>christianity,</hi>

               <p>The first is an <hi>efficacious desire</hi> of this <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>; we must <hi>desire</hi> it, and look upon it as <hi>necessary</hi> for him that would be in <hi>grace,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and convenient for a <hi>Christian.</hi> We must often <hi>excite</hi> this desire in our <hi>heart,</hi> and form in our <hi>soul</hi> an <hi>alienation</hi> and <hi>displeasure</hi> of too great a <hi>love</hi> born to our selves, and of that <hi>adherence</hi> and <hi>fastning</hi> which we have for the <hi>creature.</hi> And for as much as one of the greatest <hi>hindrances</hi> to <hi>vertue,</hi> is to think <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> that we have <hi>vertue,</hi> we must believe that we are at a great <hi>distance</hi> from the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> God <hi>demands</hi> of us, and are filled with our <hi>selves,</hi> the <hi>affection</hi> of the <hi>creature,</hi> and <hi>voyd</hi> of God. Hence we proceed and raise in our selves a <hi>continuall hunger</hi> after God, a <hi>desire</hi> and a firm <hi>purpose</hi> to <hi>approach</hi> unto him, to <hi>love</hi> him, to <hi>please</hi> him, and to <hi>separate</hi> our selves from our <hi>selves,</hi>and from all <hi>creatures.</hi> We must think upon these words,<note place="margin">Rev. 3 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou sayest, I am rich, and encreased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not thou art wretched and miserable
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29616:127"/>
and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> In fine, as all <hi>Evangelick perfection</hi> practised and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> consisteth in <hi>two points,</hi> in <hi>love of God only,</hi> and in <hi>hate of our selves;</hi> we must study to establish and advance our selves in these <hi>two Principles,</hi> we must vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly <hi>seek God,</hi> in <hi>all</hi> occurrences, in <hi>all</hi> things, at <hi>all</hi> times, and <hi>annihilate</hi> our selves upon all occasions and objects presented to us.</p>
               <p>The second <hi>Practise</hi> must be <hi>actuall abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> we must study to <hi>annihilate</hi> and <hi>go out of our selves.</hi> This may be <hi>done two wayes; One,</hi> when we seek <hi>occasions to practise self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,</hi> or choose some <hi>exercise</hi> upon this <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> This is for those who have <hi>courage</hi> and a great <hi>desire</hi> to be <hi>God's,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> good <hi>Christians:</hi> But many belive not that they ought to <hi>renounce,</hi> and have not sufficient <hi>courage</hi> to seek occasions to <hi>annihilate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. There is <hi>another</hi> manner whereby they may profit by this <hi>exercise,</hi> which is <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with a spirit of self-deniall whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to them,</hi> and to <hi>entertain it</hi> as from the <hi>hands</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without which nothing can <hi>happen</hi> unto us, and to whom all the <hi>powers of the earth</hi> are subject: Here the <hi>soul</hi> must have a <hi>care</hi> to be <hi>faithfull</hi> to <hi>God</hi> when any occasions <hi>occurre</hi> to practise the <hi>interiour</hi> or <hi>exteriour self-deniall,</hi> to make <hi>good use</hi> of it,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29616:127"/>
as <hi>God</hi> shall give him <hi>power,</hi> and according to the <hi>objects</hi> God shall cause them to be presented to him. It is a Lesson that all <hi>Christians</hi> ought to <hi>learn,</hi> that we are <hi>obliged,</hi> and it must be our continuall endeavour to <hi>destroy in us the old man,</hi> even in the least things, if we will have the <hi>new Adam, Iesus Christ</hi> to <hi>live</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>If it be <hi>demanded</hi> what <hi>self-deniall</hi> is, since it concerns us so much to <hi>practise</hi> it; I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> to <hi>practise self-deniall,</hi> is to <hi>go out of our selves,</hi> and to <hi>sever our selves</hi> from the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to <hi>employ</hi> our <hi>heart,</hi> and make <hi>our selves</hi> fit to bear God, for our <hi>heart</hi> is God's, and he <hi>created</hi> it by his <hi>power,</hi> he <hi>consecrated</hi> it by his <hi>grace</hi> to dwell there, and be there as a <hi>Father</hi> in his <hi>family</hi>; the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>heavens,</hi> a <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>kingdom; Sin</hi> drives him from thence, the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>selves</hi> and the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> holds the place of God, and hath the boldness and rashness to seat it self in the <hi>Throne</hi> of God. This <hi>love</hi> of <hi>our selves</hi> and of the <hi>creature,</hi> reignes tyrannically in us, <hi>usurps</hi> the right of <hi>divinity,</hi> does all there that God ought to do. The <hi>duty</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> is to <hi>establish God in his Throne,</hi> to <hi>re-place him in his heart,</hi> and to <hi>let him raign in his soul.</hi> To do this we must necessarily drive away this <hi>love</hi> of <hi>our selves,</hi> and <hi>extirpate</hi> our <hi>affection</hi> to the <hi>creature.</hi> This is the office of <hi>self-denyall,</hi>

which <hi>annihilates</hi> us, and makes us go out of our selves, and clear our heart to replace therein the <hi>fulness</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To practise self-denyall,</hi> and for a man to go out of himself, is <hi>to have no other desire then purely to please God, to have no other will then his, to have nothing but God before his eyes, and to quit all considerations of the World, onely to seek the glory of God.</hi> To <hi>go out of our selves</hi> is to <hi>lose the care of our selves,</hi> either of the soul or body, <hi>to commit our selves wholly to the will of God, to abandon our selves wholly to his conduct,</hi> and the order he hath establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all eternity over our life. It is to think no more of that which concerns us, and to desire no more that any love us, or esteem us, no more to seek our own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests or satisfaction, but onely the pure will of God. <hi>So to live,</hi> is to <hi>go out of, and to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate our selves</hi>; for the soul by these practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, renounces and <hi>annihilates</hi> in her self all <hi>affections,</hi> all <hi>respects,</hi> all <hi>care</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> all that is not God or of God, and so renders her self capable to possess God.</p>
               <p>To attain this <hi>practise</hi> of this <hi>vertue,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the meanes already supposed, a third may be added, which is, when God himself operates in the soul the <hi>annihilation</hi> he would have there, and there are two ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>wayes</hi> that he makes use of herein, one
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29616:128"/>
by <hi>christian</hi> and <hi>justifying grace,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the soul, till he drive thence, and <hi>annihilates</hi> what is contrary to him, and as far as it reigns herein, and possesses the <hi>heart</hi> it proportionably <hi>annihilates</hi> in us this <hi>love of our selves,</hi> and of the <hi>Creature</hi> so truly, that we may say, there is <hi>as much</hi> of the one, as there is little of the other, for <hi>grace</hi> and the <hi>love</hi> of our selves cannot reign together, one drives away the other. Besides grace, God makes use of divers favours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications secret and interiour, as <hi>lights, motions</hi> and other <hi>divine</hi> and loving <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whereby he infallibly operates <hi>self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall</hi> and <hi>annihilation</hi> in us. It is a true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that <hi>God never operates any effects which bring not purity, self-denyall, and annihilation into the soule</hi>; where these effects meet not, it is a certain mark that it is not the <hi>work of God,</hi> for God who is <hi>purity,</hi> cannot ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate but <hi>purely,</hi> he is alwayes like <hi>himself.</hi> If there be an <hi>operation of God,</hi> there is <hi>purity,</hi> and consequently <hi>annihilation,</hi> for <hi>purity</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilates <hi>impurity.</hi> If in the operation which the soul bears, there is not the effect of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>annihilation,</hi> 'tis not an operation of God, or an effect of <hi>grace,</hi> but an effect of proper or naturall <hi>love,</hi> or else <hi>of the Devill, who can transform himself into an Angel of light, but he cannot give the soul the effects of light,</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:29616:129"/>
which is to be observed thereby, to know how to discern <hi>naturall operations</hi> from those of <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>truth</hi> will appear most clear, if we consider the designs of God in his divine and loving communications. We know that <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>communicate</hi> himself, nor work in our <hi>souls,</hi> but to <hi>prepare</hi> and render them worthy and capable to <hi>receive</hi> him; being therein received, he will possess and fill them with his fulness. How can all this be done in the soul, if <hi>God</hi> at first by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations doth not <hi>purifie</hi> the soul, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from all things? without doubt, if God operate, you shall see all these <hi>effects,</hi> and therefore the soul that will be perfect, must narrowly look into all this, and have an extraordinary vigilancy to become faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and attentive to the <hi>operations</hi> of God in her, on one side to <hi>correspond</hi> thereto, and to labour after the manner God inspires her with, on the other to annihilate <hi>her self, not the works of God,</hi> for if we oppose not our selves to <hi>grace</hi> and the effects thereof, if we do not <hi>annihilate</hi> the works of God in us, God will certainly work great things in us. But alas! the wayes whereby we make use of <hi>devotion</hi> in this <hi>age,</hi> are more capable to drive God away, then to invite him into our hearts. I shall describe them unto you.</p>

                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:29616:129"/>The soul blinded with <hi>naturall love</hi> to her <hi>self,</hi> desires to be brought up in the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, she would enjoy him, and would love what seems good and profitable to her; she fills her self with divers <hi>desires,</hi> she tyes her self thereto, and will continually act and attain, she puts her self into all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and motions, she seeks them, she pleases her self with a <hi>satisfaction</hi> that her own <hi>love</hi> takes in <hi>things</hi> most <hi>holy,</hi> and in the very <hi>operation</hi> of God, she seeks her self therein, she <hi>elevates</hi> her self thereto.

but above all, they must be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and attentive to his inward <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> having a great care and fidelity to leave the <hi>spirit</hi> to act by the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in them.

               </p>
               <p>God, who is <hi>truth,</hi> is not satisfied with these <hi>feignings,</hi> and <hi>wills,</hi> that we serve him in <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> he detests a <hi>lye,</hi> and <hi>curses those that serve him with the mouth onely;</hi> if he <hi>love,</hi>

                  <hi>dispositions</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> which lead us to this estate, and to make us <hi>perfect.</hi> Indeed many other <hi>vertues</hi> might be proposed, but these contain all, and infallibly guide to the <hi>estate</hi> God requires of us. Faith makes us know and <hi>esteem</hi> of God, it shews us the <hi>way</hi> to God, and leads us to the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our selves</hi>; this <hi>knowledge</hi> draws us to <hi>humility,</hi> that humbles us and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses us <hi>to receive God</hi>; the <hi>good desire,</hi> if it be <hi>efficacious,</hi> draws us to God; <hi>purity</hi> makes us <hi>worthy</hi> of God; and <hi>self-deniall</hi> brings to the <hi>fulness</hi> of God. He that hath <hi>God,</hi> hath <hi>all,</hi> he is <hi>perfect,</hi> and he that hath not God, is <hi>nothing,</hi> and hath <hi>nothing.</hi> Do what he can, though he should do <hi>miracles,</hi> (as <hi>Iudas</hi> probably did) he can do nothing that is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> no work <hi>worthy of heaven,</hi> for it is God onely that <hi>works in us the works of grace,</hi> and who is the principle of our merits (<hi>which must be well noted</hi>) therefore he that will be saved, and become a <hi>perfect Christian</hi> must aim only at this point. All that we have proposed serve hereunto. The first thing demanded, is <hi>to endeavour to have a good foundation,</hi> and a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere uncorrupted interiour,</hi> to <hi>conduct</hi> us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>maximes</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> to regard God in all things, to please him, or at least, not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him, with particular care to <hi>annihilate</hi>

the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> for they are enemies to <hi>God,</hi> they can no more dwell together, then <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau.</hi> After all these <hi>dispositions,</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God, and be wholly left to his <hi>operations</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> and be very <hi>vigilant</hi> to shew her self <hi>faithfull</hi> to correspond with the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of God, and not to withdraw her self from his <hi>conduct,</hi> and the order he would take with her.</p>
               <p>This last <hi>point</hi> is of great consequence, and deserves to be a little more insisted upon; for it is the <hi>last touch</hi> we shall give to the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of a <hi>perfect Christian.</hi> We must observe, that in the <hi>order of grace,</hi> it is not as in the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature.</hi> In <hi>nature,</hi> that which is most dependant on it's <hi>cause</hi> is the most <hi>imperfect,</hi> as the <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> which is so dependant on its <hi>cause,</hi> that it ceases to <hi>be</hi> when it ceases to be <hi>produced:</hi> In <hi>nature,</hi> that is esteemed most <hi>perfect</hi> which hath the least <hi>dependance.</hi> It is otherwise in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> that is most <hi>perfect</hi> which is neerest and the most <hi>dependant</hi> on its <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> God; so that he that tends to <hi>perfection,</hi> must be in a great <hi>dependance</hi> on God, and not <hi>act</hi> but in this <hi>disposition,</hi> and by a generall <hi>resignation of himself to God:</hi> To put and establish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in this estate, he must have <hi>a pure regard of God,</hi> that is, he must hold all of God, and

               <p>To conclude, as the <hi>soul</hi> most <hi>purely</hi> walks in the wayes wherein God will <hi>lead</hi> her, so must she also <hi>endeavovr</hi> to follow the <hi>light of Faith,</hi> and <hi>maximes</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which shall serve her as a <hi>guide</hi>; thus shall her <hi>heart</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>neat,</hi> having no other <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor other <hi>hope,</hi> but to <hi>be to God,</hi> and to <hi>please God, caring</hi> for nothing else; she shall fill her <hi>spirit</hi> with a great <hi>esteem</hi> of God, and <hi>respect</hi> to his <hi>greatness</hi> and the infinite <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>divinity,</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of her own <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>humility</hi> abandon

said, <hi>Beauty is a flash of goodness,</hi> as all flowers and leaves take their beauty from the root, so all that is <hi>outwardly fair</hi> in man, is but a beam of his <hi>inward goodness,</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>leaves</hi> of his perfect and <hi>vertuous actions,</hi> are but the effects of the <hi>root</hi> of <hi>inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>

                  <hi>Inward perfection</hi> begets the <hi>outward,</hi> one cannot be without the other. Good if it be <hi>perfect,</hi> must be such in all parts, if one fail, this <hi>defect</hi> takes away its <hi>vertue,</hi> and makes it <hi>vicious.</hi> Man is a <hi>whole</hi> composed of <hi>parts,</hi> neither all soul nor all body, but consisting of both.

               <p>St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaking of the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> the pattern of <hi>vertue,</hi> saith, that her <hi>exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Beauty,</hi> her <hi>demeanour,</hi> and the <hi>actions</hi> of her life, were <hi>images</hi> of the <hi>vertues</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>perfections</hi> of her <hi>soul</hi>; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> meant to hide the <hi>greatness</hi> of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> in the <hi>lowness</hi> of our <hi>nature,</hi> and hid himself <hi>thirty years</hi> in an obscure life, yet it alwayes appeared from time to time, nor could he avoid it, but that his face, his body and actions, discover'd what he was.

can have no good but what it borrows of the <hi>interiour</hi> as of its root, and the <hi>interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> cannot be <hi>perfect,</hi> but the <hi>exteriour</hi> will bear and manifest the effects thereof. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> if it be true, hath a lustre like the <hi>Emerald</hi> which sparkles in the obscurest night, it can no more be hid, then fire can be retain'd in the bosom of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which will force a way to its <hi>centre</hi>; or the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> be clouded by any <hi>shade</hi> so thick, but its <hi>beams</hi> will break through.

               <p>We must not indeed endeavour to be seen, much lesse to be esteemed, or <hi>affect</hi> the sight of men, but on the other side, we must not <hi>fear</hi> them.

                  <hi>image</hi> of God, who lives in us.</p>
               <p>This may be more clearly understood by the advice of the same St. <hi>Paul;</hi> we <hi>walk not</hi> (saith he, speaking of good Christians) <hi>after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi> He then that will be a good Christian,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.4.</note> must order his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>actions</hi> according to the <hi>spirit</hi> of God who lives in us, not after the flesh and the World, enemies to the spirit of God. To be <hi>vertuous,</hi> and to do acts of <hi>vice,</hi> to have light in the heart, and to do actions of <hi>darkness,</hi> to be in the Temple of God, and to sacrifice to <hi>Baal,</hi> can neither be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by man, nor approved by reason.

Can we have thee in our hearts, and thy enemy the World in our hands and mouth? No no, a Christian, if he fear God at home in his own house, will fear him abroad in the <hi>Kings</hi> Palace. The devout <hi>soul,</hi> who beholds God

in her heart, and sees nothing but <hi>God</hi> there, beholds him every where. She knowes not that the World sees her, she onely knowes her God, beholds her, and she her God; that suffices her. If a Christian love his God, he will love him every where, and not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men, he will say with the spouse, my God <hi>is mine and I am his.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2.16.</note> The Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster St. <hi>Paul,</hi> gives us a good lesson upon this subject, and in divers places furnishes us with reasons to perswade us to the care we ought to have of the outward man, and of the actions that appear to the eyes of men, he sayes, that first we owe to God, the care of perfecting our <hi>exteriour,</hi> for God will be honoured by our <hi>actions.</hi> This <hi>object</hi> we must have continually before our <hi>eyes,</hi> this <hi>thought</hi> must never go out of our <hi>souls</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 14.8.</note> the reason that the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives is, that we are not our own but Gods, <hi>whether we live or die, we are the Lords,</hi> saith he, and consequently in all our <hi>exteriour actions,</hi> we must have a regard to God, as if I should say, whether at <hi>Court,</hi> in <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> in <hi>happiness</hi> or <hi>misfortune,</hi> in what estate soever I am in of <hi>death</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> what condition soever I live in, I am Gods, and therefore must so order my self, that in all <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>estates,</hi> I may honour God by my <hi>actions,</hi> that my <hi>exteriour</hi> may be as agreeable to him as my <hi>interiour.

               </p>
               <p>If this reason be not sufficient, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives you another, taken from the condition of Christians, and which they profess, <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> As a <hi>Gentleman</hi> is oblig'd to live like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> like a <hi>Prince,</hi> every one according to his <hi>quality</hi>; so a <hi>Christian</hi> must live according to the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> his <hi>exteriour</hi> life must be

The perfect <hi>Christian</hi> must take heed that he do nothing <hi>inwardly</hi> or <hi>outwardly,</hi> but according to the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of God.

for God to abandon us thus to our own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> and will, is the greatest <hi>evill</hi> that can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to man, the greatest <hi>punishment</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God can <hi>revenge</hi> himself of the <hi>sins</hi> of men. <hi>My people would not hear my voyce</hi> (saith God being angry,<note place="margin">Psal. 81.11, 12.</note>) <hi>and Israel would not obey me, so I gave them up unto their own hearts lust, and let them follow their own imaginations.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, that Gods most rigorous <hi>punishment</hi> of the ingratitude of men, hath been to leave them to their <hi>own desires and appetites;</hi>

               <p>It imports him therefore who would be a good <hi>Christian,</hi> and make his <hi>salvation</hi> sure, to forsake his own <hi>conduct,</hi> to <hi>annihilate his inclinations, passions, appetites,</hi> to confound his own <hi>will,</hi> to withdraw himself from the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>humane prudence,</hi> and from his own <hi>reason,</hi> to follow the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> which is above <hi>reason,</hi> and illuminates and guides, that <hi>he</hi> do nothing but according to the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, law,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God.</p>

               <p>If we would know what this <hi>conduct</hi> of God is, wherein it consists, we must consider it two wayes.

men, who being left to themselves, walk in <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>ignorance. Counsel is mine, equity is mine, wisdom is mine,</hi> saith the <hi>spirit</hi> of God. He then that will <hi>live</hi> according to <hi>prudence,</hi> according to <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low good counsels, must have them from God, for <hi>true prudence</hi> and <hi>true justice</hi> belongs to God.

Lord, thou hast made me wise by thy <hi>word,</hi> said <hi>David,</hi> who had try'd it.

               </p>
               <p>There is another <hi>conduct</hi> of God, more hidden and invisible, when God vouchsafes by the <hi>motions</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> his <hi>inspirations</hi> and <hi>loving communications</hi> to <hi>conduct souls</hi> to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and takes a particular care of them. Here the <hi>soul</hi> must take a great and vigilant care, that she <hi>quench</hi> not in her these <hi>lights,</hi> and resist not this <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>amorous conduct.</hi> This way is for <hi>souls</hi> who give themselves to God, who are wholly out of themselves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of, and severed from the <hi>Creature,</hi> who have <hi>annihilated</hi> their <hi>desires, inclinations</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> who are wholly abandon'd to God, professing to live no longer then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>conduct</hi> of this <hi>divine spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who are thus <hi>happy,</hi> must take great care to maintain their <hi>spirits</hi> in a neere <hi>alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> with the <hi>spirit</hi> of God, to do nothing but by his <hi>conduct</hi>; they must take heed they <hi>admit</hi> not any thing, nor <hi>receive</hi> any other <hi>spirit</hi> which may separate them from that of God.

               <head>CHAP. III. That a <hi>Christian</hi> must do all his <hi>actions</hi> for love of God, and for God.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>perfect Christian</hi> must not so much consider what he does, as the manner of doing; for men consider the <hi>face,</hi> God the <hi>heart.</hi> It is a <hi>maxime</hi> in <hi>Morality,</hi> that it suffices not to do <hi>good actions,</hi> but we must do them <hi>well,</hi> as the <hi>Philosopher</hi> saith; it is not enough to do <hi>just things,</hi> but they must be done <hi>justly,</hi> meaning, that an <hi>action</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> must be <hi>accomplished</hi> with all these <hi>circumstances</hi> which are so <hi>necessary,</hi> that if this <hi>fail,</hi> all the rest will be <hi>deficient; good,</hi> if it be <hi>true good,</hi> must be <hi>accomplished</hi> in every <hi>point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, our <hi>Question</hi> is not only of an <hi>action good</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> but which is more, of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an action,</hi> suitable to the <hi>eminence</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> of an <hi>action</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> If it be <hi>reall,</hi> it must have <hi>circumstances</hi> onely <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> and chiefly it is <hi>requisite</hi> they have a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate <hi>object</hi>; for as <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>specified</hi> by their <hi>objects,</hi> so is it <hi>necessary</hi> that the <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> of a <hi>true Christian action</hi> be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:29616:145"/>
to consider, what is it's <hi>object</hi> which must be proportioned to the <hi>dignity, sanctity</hi> and <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of an <hi>action</hi> worthy God; which being supposed, this <hi>object</hi> can be no other then God himself, and therefore we must say, that as all the <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> must be <hi>conformable</hi> to their <hi>state,</hi> all <hi>worthy</hi> of God, so must they have God only for their <hi>object,</hi> and consequently a <hi>Christian</hi> to <hi>live Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> must have respect onely to God in all his <hi>actions,</hi> and to do nothing but with <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>please</hi> him. This is the wish of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he prayed to God for the <hi>new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to whom he writ, <hi>That you might walk,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>worthy of the Lord, as unto all pleasing.</hi> This <hi>counsell</hi> ought to be <hi>engraven</hi> in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of men; for either they think not of it, or are <hi>ignorant</hi> of it, yet is it altogether necessary.</p>
               <p>Let us then suppose this to our <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> that to do acts truly <hi>Christian,</hi> and worthy of God, we must <hi>regard</hi> nothing but God, and have no other <hi>intent</hi> then to <hi>please</hi> him. The <hi>reason</hi> is from the <hi>commandment</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> for by the same <hi>principle</hi> that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to <hi>love</hi> God in <hi>all,</hi> and above all, we are obliged also to <hi>please</hi> him in <hi>all,</hi> and to seek onely his <hi>honour, glory,</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> He that knows how to <hi>love,</hi> will easily <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of this <hi>counsell</hi>; For <hi>love,</hi> if it be <hi>true,</hi>

               <p>To <hi>comprehend</hi> this <hi>truth,</hi> we must observe that all the <hi>creatures</hi> are nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; they are as but a drop of water drawn up by the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if all <hi>creatures</hi> are nothing, man is yet less; and man being so small a thing, his <hi>action</hi> can be no more; but if the <hi>creatures,</hi> if <hi>man</hi> and his <hi>actions</hi> are any thing before God, it is onely in as much as they <hi>regard</hi> God, and have <hi>relation</hi> to him; For nothing is <hi>worthy</hi> of God, but what is of God, and for God. <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>earth,</hi> are nothing,<note place="margin">Isa. 66.1.</note> yet are they <hi>esteemed</hi> worthy of <hi>honour,</hi> because <hi>heaven is the throne of God, earth is his footstool.</hi> We may say as much of man, although he be nothing in himself, or in his <hi>actions,</hi> yet they are most worthy by this <hi>relation</hi> to God, and <hi>regard</hi> of God.

being <hi>consecrated</hi> and <hi>dedicated</hi> to God, so our <hi>actions,</hi> though they be <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of God, yet being <hi>referred</hi> and <hi>dedicated</hi> to his <hi>honour,</hi> and the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> they are raised up, and become <hi>pleasing</hi> to God.

Therefore one of the greatest <hi>faults</hi> to be observed in <hi>piety,</hi> which makes us most <hi>unworthy</hi> of God, is want of this <hi>regard</hi> of God. Many instead of <hi>referring</hi> all things to God, <hi>seek</hi> nothing but themselves, <hi>labour</hi> onely for themselves, and in all that they do, think onely of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and if they should <hi>examine</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:29616:147"/>
as they ought, they would find that the end of their <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> is nothing but their own <hi>Interest,</hi> and going on in the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of these confusions, they will find, that seeking to do their own <hi>will,</hi> they do what God <hi>requires</hi> not, and fail to do that which he <hi>commands.</hi> By this <hi>abuse</hi> it appeares that such <hi>souls</hi> design their own <hi>health</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> to be their <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>object</hi> of their <hi>actions.</hi> By so doing, God is no more their <hi>ultimate end,</hi> nor the centre of their <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> but their own <hi>interests</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> take the <hi>place</hi> of God, an <hi>errour</hi> so manifest, that it is easie to <hi>perceive,</hi> and necessary to <hi>condemn</hi> the same.</p>
               <p>Let us remember a <hi>principle</hi> very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that teacheth us, if there were neither <hi>Heaven</hi> nor <hi>Hell</hi> to recompence or punish, yet we were <hi>obliged</hi> to devote our selves wholly to God, to fulfill his <hi>designes,</hi> and to render him <hi>honour</hi> in every thing. This is an indispensable <hi>obligation</hi> whereto we are bound by the <hi>condition</hi> of our <hi>being,</hi> for as such we are Gods, being Gods, we ought to <hi>refer</hi> our selves <hi>wholly</hi> to him, and be onely for him. The <hi>fruit</hi> is his to whom the <hi>Tree</hi> belongs; if we belong wholly to God, our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> consequently must be <hi>referred</hi> to his <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> employed in the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment</hi> of his <hi>Will.</hi> In effect, none can

be <hi>ignorant,</hi> but that we are in the <hi>World</hi> to do the <hi>work</hi> that God hath put into our <hi>hands,</hi> according to our <hi>vocation,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>manner</hi> that he <hi>proposeth,</hi> and for the <hi>end</hi> that he hath <hi>ordained</hi> us.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more <hi>evident</hi>; for what have we to do in this <hi>World,</hi> and what should our <hi>soul</hi> aim at, but to accomplish the will of God, and to do all our <hi>actions</hi> according to the designes, and order established by the <hi>eternall wisdom?</hi> why are we in the <hi>World,</hi> if we <hi>please</hi> not God?

               <p>This is the onely point of our <hi>happiness,</hi> the principall care that a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to have, to regard God in all his <hi>Actions,</hi> and to <hi>perform</hi> them in a pure desire to <hi>please</hi> him.

               <p>To transgress this <hi>regard</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> is to forsake the <hi>Sun</hi> to go into <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> to destroy the <hi>perfection</hi> and purity which makes an action truly <hi>Christian.</hi> We ought therefore to have continually in our <hi>heart</hi> the prayer of <hi>David, Turn away mine eyes,</hi>

               <p>One of the greatest <hi>retardments</hi> that the <hi>soul</hi> finds in the way to <hi>perfection</hi> in any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or estate, is quitting the <hi>pure regard,</hi> and going out of the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>intention</hi> to seek <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of God. By reason of that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> can never taste God, nor arrive at <hi>perfection.</hi> We need no other proofs of this, then the difference between pleasing God and the <hi>Creature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>glory</hi> of God and our own <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;</hi> they are two paths so contrary, that it is as impossible for them to subsist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>falshood,</hi> or bitter and sweet without <hi>corrupting.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> who seeks her own <hi>satisfaction,</hi> to please her <hi>self</hi> in her <hi>self,</hi> or any other <hi>thing,</hi> is as far from pleasing God, as the <hi>Creature</hi> is from God.

               <p>Reason it self shewes us that those <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies</hi> and <hi>self-satisfactions,</hi> are unworthy a <hi>heart</hi> that God hath <hi>created</hi> onely for his <hi>pleasure,</hi> consecrated to his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour</hi>; of a <hi>heart</hi> I say, that God will <hi>possess,</hi> and

They are unworthy of God, opposite to the <hi>purity</hi> of his <hi>love.</hi> As God is <hi>pure</hi> in his <hi>entertainments,</hi> and <hi>jealous</hi> in his <hi>love,</hi> he never suffers such an evill, seeing it is not becoming his <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to divide his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>contentment,</hi> to mingle his <hi>honour</hi> with <hi>self-satisfaction</hi> and the <hi>complacency</hi> of the <hi>creature.</hi> The <hi>law</hi> of <hi>love</hi> forbids this <hi>division;</hi> we are <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>love</hi> God with all our <hi>heart,</hi> that is, <hi>perfectly,</hi> for as he that <hi>loves</hi> well, cannot <hi>love</hi> two things; so he that will <hi>satisfie</hi> himself, and <hi>please</hi> the <hi>creature,</hi> cannot <hi>satisfie God,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> himself to his <hi>divine will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> teaches this <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> for if we are <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> only for <hi>God,</hi> why then all these <hi>satisfactions?</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> that desires to be <hi>saved,</hi> must onely seek <hi>perfection,</hi> that is <hi>God</hi>; for true <hi>perfection</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the <hi>possession</hi> and <hi>seeking</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> she must have <hi>no regard,</hi> but that of <hi>God,</hi> no other <hi>intention,</hi> but to <hi>please</hi> him.

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the care a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to have to do all his actions according to his vocation, and to maintain himself in the order and conduct of God.</head>
               <p>NExt <hi>interiour dispositions</hi> necessary to <hi>Christian perfection,</hi> it is convenient to speak of the <hi>exteriour,</hi> to make our <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> see how he must comport himself to be <hi>perfect in all things.</hi> We have already spoken of the <hi>care,</hi> we must have to appear <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>exemplary</hi> and to <hi>walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as the Apostle sayes, <hi>according to the truth of the Gospel.</hi> Next we have shewed how all his <hi>actions</hi> must be squared to the <hi>Law of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> subject to his <hi>conduct,</hi> which is the <hi>Law</hi> of his <hi>divine inspirations.</hi> Lastly, we have proved, that to do <hi>actions</hi> worthy of God, and conformable to his <hi>sanctity</hi> and the <hi>state of Christianity,</hi> they must <hi>regard</hi> God, and have no <hi>intention</hi> but to <hi>please him.</hi> It remains that we shew what is the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>perfection,</hi> the most considerable in <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an piety,</hi> that is, how all our <hi>actions</hi> should be done according to our <hi>vocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The life of man is a <hi>circle</hi> that <hi>comes forth</hi> from God, and must <hi>return</hi> to God. God alone is the <hi>Principle</hi> of our <hi>being,</hi> of our <hi>life,</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:29616:153"/>
and of our <hi>action,</hi> &amp; as he is the <hi>beginning</hi> of them, so is he the <hi>end</hi> thereof. He is the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> does all in us, he is our <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>recalls</hi> us unto himself, so that we <hi>have all</hi> of God, and are <hi>recalled back</hi> to God, for the <hi>creature</hi> bears a right <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> which can never be <hi>annihilated,</hi> which causes it to subsist, calls it back to it's God, there to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> as to its <hi>repose</hi> and <hi>ultimate perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein we find two <hi>things</hi> remarkable which belong to our <hi>subject</hi>; one, that God is the <hi>beginning</hi> of our <hi>actions,</hi> the other, that he is the <hi>end.</hi> He is the <hi>beginning</hi> of our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> because there is no <hi>good</hi> in us which <hi>God does not;</hi> of <hi>him</hi> we have the <hi>motion, thought,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> to <hi>do well</hi>; he gives us the <hi>effect</hi> of it, and not only gives us the <hi>power</hi> to <hi>do it,</hi> but himself <hi>does it</hi> in us, so truely that he is more the <hi>Authour</hi> of a <hi>good work</hi> then we <hi>our selves,</hi> and according to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> we should say to God, <hi>Lord, thou hast wrought all our works in us. It is God,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul, that worketh in us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 26.12.</note> 
                  <hi>both to will and to do, of his good pleasure</hi>; implying, not onely that <hi>God gives us his grace</hi> and <hi>good motions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> which joyned with our <hi>consent</hi> effect the <hi>work,</hi> but that <hi>by grace, God is in us</hi> after a new and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner united to our <hi>souls</hi> which <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> to him, and by this <hi>union</hi> and <hi>adherence</hi> God fills the <hi>capacity</hi> which the <hi>soul</hi> hath to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:29616:154"/>
                  <hi>good</hi> and to <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>operates</hi> in her, and by her the <hi>action of vertue,</hi> but so, that it is <hi>he</hi> who <hi>operates</hi> more then <hi>we: We operate,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine; but it is God who operates in us this operation.</hi> Thus is <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of our <hi>actions,</hi> and the <hi>beginning</hi> of them, whence it follows, that he is also the <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>being</hi> and <hi>operations</hi>; the <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>being,</hi> because he is the <hi>Creator</hi> thereof, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>order of nature,</hi> that which is the <hi>beginning</hi> of a thing is also the end thereof, and by the <hi>order</hi> that <hi>God</hi> holds in his loving <hi>operations,</hi> he cannot act, but he must be the <hi>end</hi> of his action, and as he is the <hi>beginning</hi> of the being, action and perfection of man, so is he the <hi>end thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Principle</hi> teaches us, that as God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the <hi>end</hi> of man, so he alone gives the <hi>meanes,</hi> and prescribes the <hi>order</hi> that he must keep to come to <hi>God</hi> his <hi>end.</hi> For as the <hi>Creature</hi> hath not power to draw it self from <hi>nothing,</hi> so hath it not the <hi>right</hi> to propose an <hi>end</hi> to it self, nor to prescribe to it self the <hi>order, way</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> to come to this <hi>end;</hi> that appertains to God, who alone can give the <hi>being, propose</hi> the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>prescribe</hi> the <hi>means.</hi> And when <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>prescribed</hi> the <hi>end</hi> and ordained the <hi>meanes</hi> thereto, yet cannot we follow the <hi>way,</hi> nor keep this <hi>order,</hi> if God himself doth not <hi>act</hi> in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:29616:154"/>
us, <hi>conduct</hi> us, and work in us what is necessary to attain our <hi>end,</hi> for he alone is the <hi>beginning</hi> of all our <hi>actions,</hi> he performs both the <hi>will</hi> and the <hi>deed, We are his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (speaking of <hi>God</hi>) <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Christ Iesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>that we should walk in them.</hi> Hereby the <hi>Apostle</hi> sheweth, that <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>regulated</hi> the life of man, <hi>ordained</hi> all his <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> prepared all the good <hi>works</hi> wherein he wills that he should employ himself, that it is <hi>God</hi> who does all in us, and that we are his <hi>workmanship,</hi> so all our <hi>safety</hi> consists in <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>end, God</hi> alone hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>meanes</hi> to arrive at our <hi>end; God</hi> alone must conduct and operate in us <hi>works neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to that end whereto we are called. Herein consisteth all the <hi>happiness</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, all the <hi>duty</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> whence all the <hi>piety,</hi> all the <hi>care</hi> we must have, consists in these <hi>three points,</hi> which contain the <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all the rest; to <hi>tend</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, to <hi>continue</hi> in the order and conduct of God, and to <hi>entertain</hi> all the <hi>divine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>; to let God act, who conducts us in that <hi>order</hi> he hath established over us, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates in us incessantly the <hi>works</hi> which he prepared from all <hi>eternity.</hi> In these <hi>three points,</hi> consisteth all the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Therefore we
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:29616:155"/>
must take great <hi>care</hi> herein, though they are unknown to us, and their <hi>use</hi> appear diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, yet we must endeavour to <hi>know them,</hi> and demand of God <hi>light</hi> and <hi>grace</hi>; we must <hi>follow</hi> them with <hi>fidelity,</hi> and <hi>embrace</hi> them with <hi>vigilancy</hi> in <hi>all</hi> things, even in the very <hi>least,</hi> for in what concerns God, his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> nothing is <hi>little,</hi> all is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>inestimable.</hi> Here we must consider how we may be deceived in a <hi>subject</hi> so important, that we may avoid the <hi>snares</hi> prepared for us on all sides. All the evill that can befall us herein, comes either from the <hi>Devill</hi> or from <hi>our selves,</hi> and more from <hi>our selves</hi> then from the <hi>other,</hi> for we are the <hi>principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> of our own <hi>ruine.</hi> The Devill inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his <hi>ordinary malice,</hi> being crafty, and having a thousand <hi>subtle wayes</hi> to annoy us, continually considers the <hi>wayes of God,</hi> over our souls, and by the little knowledge he hath thereof, can easily represent something of Gods <hi>Ordinance</hi> over us, of his <hi>designes</hi> and wayes to <hi>save us.</hi> Having considered these, he <hi>goeth about,</hi> he makes it his perpetuall <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi> to persecute us, and <hi>precipitate</hi> us. The first <hi>effect</hi> of his <hi>malice</hi> is <hi>to ruine in us the works of God,</hi> and to shut our heart against the <hi>motions of grace</hi>; he particularly labours to divert us from the <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> and to make us go out of the <hi>order</hi> and conduct
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:29616:155"/>
which he knowes God hath <hi>established</hi> over us. He employes a thousand <hi>surprises</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>treachery</hi>; he makes use of <hi>our selves,</hi> of all the <hi>Creatures,</hi> which are as the wise man sayes, <hi>snares for the feet of fools,</hi> he offers us <hi>pleasure.</hi> In brief, his <hi>malice</hi> omits nothing that he can make use of to ruine us. To those souls that have a little <hi>desire</hi> of good, some <hi>fear</hi> of God, and who have made some <hi>progress</hi> in <hi>vertue,</hi> he redoubles his <hi>circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and concealing his <hi>aim,</hi> does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to them either <hi>sin,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> or <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> for that would advantage him nothing, but he proposes <hi>change,</hi> he gives them divers <hi>desires,</hi> he inflames their hearts with <hi>fervours,</hi> and transported <hi>Devotions,</hi> he inspires them with other actions, with other exercises, with some other manner of living, which in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, carry's some <hi>great perfection,</hi> but look'd into narrowly all their <hi>motions</hi> and manners will prove to be nothing but <hi>deceit,</hi> and that the Devill strives but to engage the soul in a <hi>labyrinth</hi> and <hi>disorder.</hi> Those who ordinarily consent to this <hi>temptation,</hi> we find to be rash, inconstant, and easily drawn aside to quit their <hi>vocation,</hi> self-wil'd, adhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to their own <hi>judgement,</hi> disturbed in spirit, unquiet; in brief, they are full of perpetuall <hi>agitations,</hi> the marks and effects of a malignant spirit and <hi>temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:29616:156"/>By these <hi>effects,</hi> we know that the Devill with all his subtleties, onely seeks to <hi>separate</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> from God and from the <hi>peace of the spirit,</hi> and to draw it from the <hi>order</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God, that he might lead it as he would, knowing the <hi>soul</hi> being out of the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of God, is in danger, and altogether <hi>loseth her self,</hi> or else for some long time estrangeth her self from God. For it is a <hi>generall maxime, that we are nothing but what we are in God,</hi> and that going out of the <hi>order</hi> and conduct of God, we cannot but fall into evident <hi>danger,</hi> and pernicious <hi>disorder.</hi> And therefore one of the greatest <hi>cares</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> must have, is to <hi>beware</hi> of these <hi>secret crafts</hi> of the Devill to keep her self in the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of God, in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>vocation</hi> soever she be. For as the Devill labours onely to separate us from God our <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> seeking continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>annihilate</hi> in us as much as may be the <hi>works of grace,</hi> and to draw us from the <hi>order</hi> of God, so must we be very vigilant to please God, to receive the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> his divine <hi>operations,</hi> and to live in the <hi>order</hi> of God, according to our <hi>vocation</hi> and <hi>estate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not onely the <hi>Devill</hi> deceives us, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates us from God, but also the <hi>love of our own selves,</hi> and our own <hi>Inclinations.</hi> This
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:29616:156"/>
                  <hi>seed of sin</hi> which remains in us, is the <hi>principall Authour</hi> of our <hi>harm,</hi> and that which most violently drawes us from the <hi>order of God.</hi> The <hi>experience</hi> is but too ordinary, the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> evident; for the order that we ought to follow, is an <hi>order of grace,</hi> that advances us <hi>above</hi> our selves to God. <hi>Self-love</hi> depresseth man, and converts him wholly to <hi>himself,</hi> the <hi>order of God</hi> conducts him to <hi>unity,</hi> for God is <hi>unity: Self-love</hi> leads us into a <hi>Labyrinth</hi>; the works of God are alwayes pure, holy, and perfect, for God is alwayes like to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> he operates in us <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>sanctity,</hi> for he <hi>hath chosen us that we should be holy and without blame before him, in love,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>love of our selves,</hi> destroyes the <hi>work of God,</hi> instills nothing into us but <hi>impurity</hi> and <hi>imperfection.</hi> By this <hi>love, Adam</hi> went out of the <hi>order of God,</hi> and forfeited the <hi>grace</hi> which God had given him. We do the <hi>same</hi> and worse, for by <hi>sin</hi> we are enclin'd to <hi>our selves</hi> and the <hi>Creature,</hi> we are brought to take that in <hi>our selves,</hi> and in the <hi>Creature,</hi> which we ought to take onely in God. Our pleasure, repose, abundance and all other good that we are capable of, which we ought to seek in God, and receive at his hands, we seek <hi>in our selves,</hi> and in the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, separating</hi> our selves from God, who is

                  <hi>multiplicity</hi> of <hi>desires,</hi> nor seek to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>one thing,</hi> sometimes <hi>another,</hi> for all that is <hi>well,</hi> and all that is <hi>good,</hi> is not proper to every person, and although it seem <hi>good,</hi> yet is it not alwayes <hi>desirable.</hi> Some will say, we must have <hi>prudence</hi> to make choice, but we must express our selves more christianly or clearly, and say, that when any <hi>good</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented us to <hi>practise,</hi> we must lift up our eyes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and demand of God, that he would be pleased to let us know what we should do, for to speak properly, there is not any <hi>good</hi> which is pleasing unto God, further then in that he takes pleasure that we should do <hi>his will,</hi> and suffer him to act, and that we <hi>persevere</hi> in the <hi>order</hi> whereto he hath <hi>predestin'd</hi> us. The Christian therefore who would <hi>assure</hi> his <hi>salvation,</hi> must be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do all sorts of <hi>good works.</hi> His heart must be <hi>open</hi> to God, to receive all <hi>divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations</hi> and holy <hi>communications;</hi> but when it is question'd to fettle him in the <hi>one exercise</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> he must regard that which is conformable to his <hi>vocation,</hi> and above all, consider what is <hi>consonant</hi> to the state of <hi>Christianity,</hi> for he must more satisfie and regard <hi>himself</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> then as a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or <hi>Merchant,</hi> &amp;c. he must offer himself to God, and do his will, and finally receive the <hi>motions</hi> God shall operate in his <hi>soul,</hi> and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:29616:158"/>
accordingly seek alwayes the <hi>glory</hi> of God, never minding his own <hi>particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in as much as great <hi>difficulties</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happen herein, we take for a <hi>second document</hi> the <hi>necessity</hi> we have to ask <hi>counsel,</hi> and to take a <hi>Director,</hi> for this is an <hi>affair</hi> of very great <hi>consequence,</hi> seeing it <hi>acts</hi> towards the <hi>salvation of the soul.</hi> And the <hi>chief</hi> of this <hi>affair</hi> consists in <hi>conducting Christians</hi> in the wayes which God hath established to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them to <hi>perfection</hi> worthy of the <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>sanctity</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and which may render them <hi>worthy</hi> of God, and <hi>capable</hi> to enter into the <hi>glory</hi> that God hath prepared for them to all <hi>eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>conduct</hi> must not be <hi>indifferent,</hi> but the same with that of God. The <hi>Director</hi> must not <hi>guide</hi> after <hi>one</hi> manner, and God after <hi>another</hi>; for so the poor <hi>soul</hi> were lost, or tyranniz'd over. He that giveth <hi>counsel,</hi> must take heed that the <hi>matter</hi> he treats of have an <hi>immediate</hi> respect to the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>designs</hi> of God over our <hi>souls,</hi> and consider that he is upon either the <hi>ruine,</hi> or <hi>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>works</hi> of God, a <hi>point</hi> of great consequence, which makes us see what they ought to be whom God hath <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in so high an office,</hi> and who enter into so <hi>sacred a ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:29616:158"/>He that will <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>counsel</hi> a <hi>soul,</hi> must know the <hi>designes</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of God over this <hi>soul</hi>; he must consider the <hi>order</hi> God keeps to govern it, that it is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>hidden</hi> in God, that it is a <hi>secret</hi> to us, and that the <hi>soul</hi> cannot without much <hi>difficulty</hi> know it. It is necessary that he who <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi> and <hi>counsells,</hi> be full of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> that he strongly <hi>adhere</hi> to God, who is the <hi>Father of lights;</hi> otherwise, what <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or <hi>experience</hi> soever he may have, he will be deceived in the <hi>conduct.</hi> The more he shall be <hi>able</hi> and <hi>experienced,</hi> the more he shall be in hazard to <hi>deceive souls;</hi> for though <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> be necessary, yet must we not <hi>confide</hi> therein, much less <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> thereupon; for God abhors the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, and forsakes those who are <hi>over-confident of themselves.</hi> In the <hi>conduct of souls,</hi> there must always be new <hi>succours</hi> from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and new <hi>lights.</hi> He who would <hi>conduct</hi> or <hi>counsell</hi> another in that which concerns his <hi>conscience,</hi> must remember himself, that he is an <hi>Instrument</hi> of God, that he must not, either <hi>counsel</hi> or <hi>act</hi> in this <hi>soul,</hi> but what God will <hi>establish therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, he that <hi>conducts</hi> a <hi>soul,</hi> and who giveth <hi>counsel,</hi> must consider, that in <hi>truth</hi> and in <hi>conscience,</hi> he ought to have no other <hi>intention</hi> or <hi>desire,</hi> then to follow the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:29616:159"/>
very <hi>truth,</hi> to <hi>establish</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God in the <hi>soul,</hi> to <hi>lead</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> to God, and to do in <hi>that soul,</hi> the <hi>work</hi> of God, according to the <hi>intention</hi> of God, and to <hi>establish</hi> nothing therein but what God will. For which <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> he is obliged to <hi>labour</hi> much to the end that he may <hi>annihilate</hi> in the <hi>soul</hi> of any <hi>Christian</hi> whatsoever hinders the <hi>work of God,</hi> and <hi>kingdom</hi> of <hi>grace</hi>; and for his part, he must have a right <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>pure regard</hi> of God, not respecting or desiring any thing but his <hi>glory,</hi> seeking neither <hi>honour</hi> nor <hi>esteem, favour,</hi> nor <hi>advantage</hi> of those whom he <hi>conducts.</hi> And truly, if we consider what it is to <hi>conduct</hi> a <hi>soul</hi> in the <hi>design</hi> of God, and to conserve it in the <hi>order</hi> which God hath appointed it from all <hi>eternity,</hi> we shall see that it is no <hi>indifferent business,</hi> but the most <hi>noble</hi> and most <hi>important</hi> of all, and that we must apply our selves thereto, with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great <hi>charity,</hi> with <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>intentions,</hi> and a <hi>zeal to Gods glory</hi>; for it is for this that principally they who <hi>conduct</hi> shall render an <hi>account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence proceed the <hi>evil</hi> which falls out when those who <hi>conduct, lead</hi> and <hi>counsel souls</hi> negligently and with <hi>indifference,</hi> without endeavouring to find out <hi>what God requires</hi> of them, in what <hi>state</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> soever they be, and without troubling themselves
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:29616:159"/>
to establish therein the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and of his <hi>grace:</hi> and we see in what <hi>danger souls</hi> are, when they <hi>conduct</hi> them according to their <hi>own sense,</hi> or <hi>lead</hi> them by those <hi>wayes,</hi> give them the same <hi>exercises,</hi> form them by their own <hi>spirit,</hi> and which is <hi>worse,</hi> mold them to their own <hi>humour.</hi> We must proceed quite otherwise, for <hi>souls</hi> have <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent wayes,</hi> and are called to divers <hi>states</hi> of <hi>graces,</hi> as they are <hi>predestinated</hi> to divers <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>glory;</hi> and consequently he must <hi>conduct</hi> them according to the <hi>designes</hi> of God, which he must endeavour to <hi>know,</hi> and according to their <hi>vocation,</hi> and he must <hi>comport</hi> himself in the <hi>conduct</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>soul</hi> in the same manner, as if he did <hi>know</hi> from <hi>point</hi> to <hi>point</hi> the <hi>decrees</hi> which the <hi>eternall wisdom</hi> hath formed upon this <hi>soul,</hi> and all the particular wayes whereby God <hi>leads</hi> them.</p>
               <p>To know things so <hi>secret</hi> and so <hi>hidden,</hi> it is <hi>needfull</hi> to have the <hi>spirit of God,</hi> to use much <hi>prayer,</hi> and to have a great <hi>purity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;</hi> I say, <hi>purity of intention:</hi> For he who takes upon him the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>souls,</hi> and will <hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> the <hi>consciences</hi> of men, must take heed that he follow not his <hi>own spirit,</hi> that he think not of his <hi>own interests,</hi> that he seek not his <hi>own satisfaction,</hi> and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not himself to be carried away with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi>

and naturall <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>inclination.</hi> For in such a case, he may be assured, that it is no longer <hi>God</hi> that <hi>conducts</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God that <hi>governs</hi> it, but it is the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> and by this manner of <hi>conduct</hi> he shall not establish the <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>kingdom</hi> of God, but the <hi>flesh,</hi> the <hi>kingdom</hi> of <hi>sin.</hi> He who <hi>conducts,</hi> holds the <hi>place</hi> of God, both in the <hi>soul,</hi> and in the <hi>conduct;</hi> so that this were to do great wrong to the <hi>grace, power</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> of God. If we say there is <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in the <hi>soul</hi> that <hi>conducts it self,</hi> that <hi>follows her own spirit, self-love, inclinations, humour</hi> and <hi>will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the desire of the flesh</hi>; we must also <hi>affirm</hi> that the <hi>danger</hi> is greater, when he who <hi>conducts</hi> suffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be carried away with his <hi>own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and onely follows his <hi>own will</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And if the <hi>Christian</hi> be <hi>obliged,</hi> as we have shewed, to seek nothing in all his <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> but to <hi>please God;</hi> if he must have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>vigilancy</hi> to establish the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in his <hi>soul,</hi> to <hi>cooperate</hi> with his <hi>work,</hi> and to remain in the <hi>order</hi> wherein he <hi>conducts</hi> him; with far greater reason, he who <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi> a <hi>Christian soul</hi> in any <hi>profession</hi> or <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is obliged to have the same <hi>vigilancy,</hi> the same <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>intention,</hi> and regard of God, which he ought often to consider.</p>
               <p>From all these <hi>truths</hi> we may easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:29616:160"/>
how much they are deceived, who are <hi>guided</hi> by their <hi>own nature,</hi> according to the <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of their <hi>own spirit,</hi> without considering what <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of them, without any regard of the <hi>grace</hi> that God presents unto them, yea, without taking heed to the <hi>state</hi> whereto God hath called them. As likewise their <hi>error</hi> who can bear nothing but what is <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> to them, nor agree with any but those that <hi>flatter</hi> them, and suffer them to live at their <hi>own pleasure,</hi> and who best <hi>accommodate them</hi> to their <hi>inclinations, desires, humours,</hi> and such things, which are but too too ordinary. All this is <hi>dangerous,</hi> and an evident <hi>mark</hi> that such <hi>souls</hi> seek not <hi>God,</hi> nor true <hi>vertue,</hi> but the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of their <hi>own spirit.</hi> You shall find their <hi>hearts void of God, full of self-love</hi>; their <hi>actions</hi> inconstant, their <hi>thoughts</hi> in continuall <hi>changings.</hi> In fine, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>disquiets, complaints</hi> and <hi>murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Look upon their <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> it is but a <hi>pastime, unprofitableness,</hi> and the <hi>vanities</hi> of the <hi>age;</hi> and having considered it all, it will not be hard for you to know whether those <hi>souls</hi> have the <hi>fear</hi> of God and the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> yet in appearance they make a great shew, &amp; we know not whether is to blame, those who are <hi>conducted</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected</hi> or the <hi>Directors.</hi> But how ever it be,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:29616:161"/>
the <hi>Christian,</hi> who would be saved, must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein seriously, and neither fear <hi>pains</hi> nor <hi>mortifications,</hi> but seek to be conducted by the <hi>wayes</hi> that God hath ordained, and passing above all <hi>considerations,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>difficulties</hi> prove constant and complyant with the <hi>order</hi> that God hath established o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, he must every day renew his good <hi>resolutions,</hi> and pray to God to let him know and be acquainted with the <hi>designes</hi> he hath upon him, and give him <hi>grace</hi> in every point to follow them, and with <hi>fidelity</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish them.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the fidelity of the soul, and of its necessity in the wayes of grace, and the actions of a Christian.</head>
               <p>TO speak of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and to see how much it is <hi>necessary</hi> to all Christians, we must reflect upon the <hi>truths</hi> already propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and remember that man was created for God who is his <hi>end,</hi> that God alone can conduct him to this <hi>end,</hi> and that it is the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:29616:161"/>
same God who onely operates in him all the <hi>good works</hi> which are <hi>necessary</hi> to make him Gods, and to <hi>arrive</hi> at this <hi>end</hi> which is God. From these <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> we enter into our subject, and presently see, that we have not any thing more <hi>important</hi> in this World, then to <hi>go to God,</hi> to co-operate with the <hi>works</hi> which God does in us to save us, and to accomplish with <hi>fidelity,</hi> that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, and in the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>disposition</hi> that he desires, every one applying himself faithfully to the <hi>way</hi> that God proposes, and the <hi>works</hi> of his <hi>vocation,</hi> that the Priest live according to the <hi>perfection</hi> of his <hi>estate,</hi> the Christian as Christian, in brief, that all men live so as at the <hi>houre of death</hi> they may say with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> My <hi>Father, I have glorified thee upon the Earth, I have finish'd the work thou hast ordained me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>fidelity</hi> which is absolutely <hi>necessary,</hi> must be in our <hi>soul</hi> from the time we were born. Though there were neither <hi>Heaven</hi> nor <hi>Hell,</hi> we are obliged to live according to the <hi>will of our Creator,</hi> what aversness so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>creature</hi> may have, it shall be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes subject to the <hi>order of God,</hi> either in the way of <hi>justice</hi> or mercy. If we would be saved, it cannot be, unless we co-operate with the <hi>works</hi> that God will do in us, unless we become <hi>faithfull</hi> to his graces, and follow
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:29616:162"/>
the <hi>order</hi> that God hath prescrib'd, wherein he will conduct us to <hi>salvation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns us more then we think, to take heed to the <hi>designes</hi> that God hath over us, and to the <hi>vocation</hi> whereto he hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, to the <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>inspirations</hi> he gives us, to make use with <hi>fidelity</hi> of the <hi>graces</hi> he offers, least drawing our selves from the <hi>order</hi> and offer of his <hi>mercy,</hi> we enter into that of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> and one day he say to us in the <hi>rigour</hi> of his <hi>determined Decree,</hi> as he said to his people, <hi>I will choose their delusions, and bring their feares upon them, because when I called, none did answer, when I spake, they did not hear, but they did evill in my sight, and chose that in which I delighted not.</hi> Isa. 66.4.</p>
               <p>When we speak of the <hi>vocation</hi> and <hi>use</hi> we are to make of the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> of God we speak of <hi>Paradise</hi>; to despise them, is to neglect <hi>salvation.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> must consider what he does, as well in that which concerns the <hi>vocation</hi> he must choose, as in the use of the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> he receives of God, seeing thereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends all his <hi>happiness</hi> or <hi>misery</hi>; we must take heed we chuse not what God <hi>would not</hi> have us, nor despise what he <hi>would</hi> have us to <hi>embrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>point</hi> is the most important of all in a <hi>Christian life,</hi> yet is it a <hi>mystery</hi> the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:29616:162"/>
of any in <hi>Christianity.</hi> The <hi>vocation</hi> of a soul is as much hidden as her <hi>election,</hi> which none can know or easily discern by her <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</hi> The <hi>wayes</hi> of God are as much eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above ours, as <hi>Heaven</hi> above <hi>Earth,</hi> and yet (O wonderfull!) God wills that we follow his <hi>wayes,</hi> and none shall be saved, but according to the <hi>vocation</hi> whereto God from all time hath called him. What reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? seeing on the one side <hi>necessity</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains us, and on the other the <hi>incertainty</hi> and <hi>obscurity</hi> deters us. O <hi>just</hi> God, God of all <hi>bounty,</hi> who shall enlighten us in this <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> who shall resolve us in an <hi>affaire</hi> so <hi>doubtfull?</hi> who shall assure us amidst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>doubts</hi>? nothing but thy <hi>light</hi> O God, the onely <hi>refuge</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> can conduct us, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thy <hi>spirit</hi> can teach us, but thy <hi>truth</hi> can assure us, and but thy infinite <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> can protect us.</p>
               <p>This lets us see in what <hi>danger</hi> they put themselves, who so long neglect the <hi>motions, graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> of God, and make such <hi>ill use</hi> of his <hi>benefits.</hi> From these <hi>truths</hi> we learn the <hi>esteem</hi> we ought to have of our <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and with what <hi>circumspection</hi> we must make <hi>choice</hi> thereof, and if we will make our selves <hi>worthy</hi> to receive of God the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> necessary in an <hi>affaire</hi> of so great <hi>consequence</hi> for our <hi>salvation,</hi> it will be very
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:29616:163"/>
profitable to enter into these following <hi>dispositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Christian</hi> must have a pure <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> of God, and a <hi>resolution</hi> to do in every thing his <hi>divine will,</hi> being from the <hi>bottom</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi> wholly resigned to his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He must have a great <hi>sence</hi> of his <hi>weakness,</hi> he must be in an <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> before God, not esteeming himself <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> or <hi>capable</hi> of any thing, for the <hi>humble</hi> shall never perish, and, as <hi>Esay</hi> saith, God looketh <hi>to him that is poor, and of a contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and trembleth at his word.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 66.2</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He must renounce his <hi>own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,</hi> and all his <hi>particular concernments,</hi> he must not regard his <hi>own safety,</hi> that he may have no object but the <hi>pure will</hi> of God, yet in such manner, that he who resolves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main so faithfully and constantly in the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>designes</hi> of God, and proposes to make hereafter use of Gods <hi>gifts, graces</hi> and <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> and regards not <hi>perfection, advancement, vertue,</hi> not <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, must not content himself with a <hi>thought to please God,</hi> (for alas, who is worthy thereof) but <hi>cleansing</hi> and <hi>purifying</hi> his <hi>intentions, thoughts</hi> and <hi>dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> he must onely regard God, and have a desire to be in the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> of God in him, without having other <hi>interest</hi>

               <p>In fine, we must pray to God <hi>continually,</hi> and in an affaire so important as is <hi>fidelity</hi> to <hi>grace,</hi> and the employment of our <hi>life,</hi> we must demand of God, and that instantly, his <hi>light</hi> to know what he would of us, his <hi>grace</hi> to accomplish it, his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>particular assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> to <hi>persevere</hi> in it, for he alone, who <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severes</hi> to the <hi>end,</hi> shall be <hi>saved,</hi> and we know that without the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we can do nothing.</p>

               <p>THe consideration of this <hi>great evil,</hi> which draws along with it the <hi>peril</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> obliges us to find out by what <hi>way,</hi> and after what <hi>manner</hi> we come to <hi>ruine,</hi> and extinguish the <hi>operations</hi> of God in us, and what the <hi>principall subject</hi> or <hi>object</hi> is that causes us to <hi>refuse his grace,</hi> and <hi>despise his love,</hi> who <hi>loves</hi> us more then his own <hi>life,</hi> seeing that <hi>Infidelity</hi> to the <hi>graces</hi> of God, is the <hi>onely evil of our soul</hi>; this must be a <hi>point</hi> of which we ought to <hi>advise:</hi> hereunto we must <hi>apply</hi> the greatest <hi>vigilancy</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi> To understand so <hi>necessary a Doctrine,</hi> we are onely to consider <hi>grace</hi> in it's <hi>essence,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what God <hi>intends</hi> to do in us by his <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>operations:</hi> we have spoken of it elsewhere, but we will briefly repeat it upon the present <hi>subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God by his <hi>love, operations,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> gives himself to us, and possesseth us; he <hi>wills</hi> that we be wholly <hi>his</hi> as he is <hi>ours,</hi> he is <hi>in us,</hi> and lives <hi>in us,</hi> that we may live <hi>in him,</hi> and by an excessive bounty, <hi>elevates us</hi> to the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation</hi> of his <hi>divine essence,</hi> and associates us <pb n="307" facs="tcp:29616:165"/>
to all his <hi>divine greatness.</hi> For this he <hi>created</hi> us, and hath <hi>given</hi> us the <hi>capacity</hi> to <hi>love</hi> him, and in <hi>loving</hi> him, to <hi>possess</hi> him; and all that he doth in us, all the <hi>graces</hi> that he gives, are to no other <hi>end,</hi> but to <hi>accomplish</hi> all this <hi>in us.</hi> This therefore being granted, we shall find, that all the <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of God must produce <hi>two</hi> things <hi>in us; one</hi> to draw us <hi>from our selves,</hi> and separate us from the <hi>creature; the other,</hi> to draw us <hi>to God,</hi> to give us <hi>to God,</hi> and to make us <hi>one with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold in few words, the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>designs of God.</hi> This <hi>being</hi> considered, it will be easie for us to see and know that we <hi>annihilate</hi> the <hi>graces</hi> of God and his <hi>works,</hi> when we <hi>remain</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> and <hi>adhere</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> and embrace the <hi>creature;</hi> for in this <hi>doctrine of piety,</hi> we must say, that as <hi>grace separates</hi> us from <hi>our selves</hi> and the <hi>creatures,</hi> and <hi>unites</hi> us onely to God, so we separate <hi>our selves</hi> from God, and destroy his <hi>work</hi> when we <hi>are our selves,</hi> and <hi>adhere</hi> to the <hi>creature,</hi> and consequently we are <hi>less Gods,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> we are <hi>our own</hi>; so that to <hi>ruine</hi> the <hi>work of God,</hi> and <hi>annihilate</hi> his <hi>grace,</hi> is nothing else, but to be <hi>our selves,</hi> to <hi>adhere</hi> to the <hi>creature,</hi> to follow our own <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> in a word, to <hi>love our selves.</hi> This is a powerfull <hi>truth,</hi> which should beget in our

First, the <hi>Christian</hi> must take his <hi>vocation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and not of <hi>men;</hi> for as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said, God only hath <hi>power</hi> to <hi>ordain</hi> all things, and it is the greatest <hi>mark</hi> of his <hi>Omnipotency</hi> for himself to choose and <hi>ordain</hi> the <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of all men, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to give to his <hi>Elect,</hi> and to propose to them the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>light</hi> whereby he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> them to the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> he hath prepared for them.

               </p>
               <p>When therefore the <hi>Christan</hi> is at the <hi>point</hi> to make choice of his <hi>vocation,</hi> he must ask it of God, and regard only <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>desire,</hi> and to render him <hi>capable</hi> of so <hi>important</hi> a <hi>grace,</hi> he must make an <hi>entire</hi> &amp; <hi>true resignation</hi> and <hi>annihilation</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> and of the <hi>use</hi> of his <hi>liberty,</hi> and neither have choice of <hi>liberty</hi> or <hi>will</hi> in any thing that concerns him, as

having no <hi>will</hi> but that of God, leaving to <hi>God</hi> alone the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>care</hi> to <hi>choose, ordain</hi> and <hi>establish</hi> all according to his <hi>holy wil,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering nothing therein but the <hi>pure glory of God,</hi> and reserving a <hi>desire</hi> to <hi>accomplish</hi> what God by his <hi>good pleasure</hi> hath <hi>ordained</hi> him, proposing to do all that he should know to be the <hi>will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when the <hi>Christian</hi> is in a <hi>settled estate</hi> and <hi>profession,</hi> then he must <hi>live</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of his <hi>estate</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and apply himself wholly to God in the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>wayes</hi> proportioned to his <hi>estate,</hi> wherein consists the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>souls fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> To comprehend this <hi>advice,</hi> we must know that in the life of every one, there are considerable <hi>two estates; one</hi> generall, which is <hi>common</hi> to all the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity;</hi> the <hi>other</hi> particular, which consists in the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he professes in the <hi>world.</hi> The perfect <hi>Christian,</hi> who would be <hi>faithfull</hi> to God, must <hi>first</hi> have a <hi>care</hi> to <hi>agree</hi> with the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the most noble of all <hi>professions</hi> of men, and the <hi>ground</hi> whereon we must of necessity raise the whole <hi>edifice</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> in what <hi>condition</hi> soever a man be.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>soul</hi> seeing her self in a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>vocation,</hi> must wholly apply her self thereto, so as if there were no other, and although she <hi>esteem</hi> of all other <hi>vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>All things are lawfull, but all things are not expedient,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that all that is lawfull is not alwayes good to do, and that for divers circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a man must retain and deprive himself of that which is permitted.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>acquisition</hi> of <hi>exteriour things,</hi> even of those that appear lawfull, we may fail in divers manners, for the <hi>employment</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts us from God, the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>possession</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Luke 14.18.</note> others employ themselves in their <hi>affaires,</hi> some to <hi>buy,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to <hi>sell,</hi> and busying themselves in these <hi>occupations,</hi> think no more of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or, if they have <hi>thoughts</hi> or <hi>desires</hi> of it, they are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled in the <hi>confusion</hi> of <hi>affaires.</hi> So that if God offer them <hi>graces,</hi> and cause them to feel good <hi>motions,</hi> either they refuse them, or think not seriously of them. Thus they extinguish in themselves the <hi>resentments</hi> of their <hi>salvation,</hi> the <hi>esteem</hi> of God, and by little and little, make themselves insensible of the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> This <hi>evill</hi> is whereinto they fall in employing themselves too much in things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear lawfull, and whereof they have not any fear. But the <hi>Son of God</hi> adds these dreadful and menacing words, <hi>that none of those men which were bidden,</hi>

the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>exteriour things,</hi> seeing they are capable to make us lose, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>vocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no <hi>example</hi> more clearer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate this <hi>truth,</hi> then the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> who fell from the <hi>heighth of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> to turn to <hi>themselves</hi> and the <hi>Creature</hi>; and because they had a will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and employ themselves in their own <hi>perfection,</hi> they were withdrawn from beholding <hi>God,</hi> and lost <hi>themselves</hi> in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>themselves,</hi> and in the <hi>Creature,</hi> that which they ought to lay hold of, and seek in God alone. And to this day, sin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted onely, because the <hi>soul</hi> is <hi>diverted</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>converted</hi> to the <hi>Creature,</hi> and seeks in the <hi>Creature</hi> for her own particular <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>satisfaction,</hi> what she ought to seek onely in <hi>God</hi> and for <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may easily conjecture the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards</hi> which happen, and the <hi>failings</hi> which they commit, in the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>research</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and for as much as it is the <hi>snare</hi> wherein all <hi>souls</hi> are intrapped, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to beware of it, and cause all men to see it. See then in <hi>particulars,</hi> how a man ought to comport himself.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Christian</hi> who will live <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in any <hi>estate</hi> or <hi>profession,</hi> must have a care above all things, to do <hi>nothing that may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:29616:170"/>
God,</hi> for this <hi>motive</hi> is the <hi>touchstone</hi> of <hi>true perfection,</hi> the <hi>foundation</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>solid vertue,</hi> and consequently, absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for a <hi>Christian.</hi> For if, as we have elsewhere said, he must do all <hi>for</hi> the <hi>good pleasure</hi> of God, he must also by the same consequence, take need of doing any thing <hi>against</hi> the <hi>pleasure</hi> of God. In this advice, there are <hi>two things</hi> to be considered, very important to <hi>Christian Piety,</hi> one when it is said we must have a care to do <hi>nothing, sin</hi> nor <hi>any thing which displeaseth God</hi>; in these words, we must learn, that this <hi>care</hi> is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>necessary,</hi> so <hi>necessary,</hi> that it is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>care</hi> wherein a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to live. For the <hi>soul</hi> which must do nothing to displease God, and detests all that may displease him, shall never fail to be acceptable to his <hi>divine eyes,</hi> who contemplating her in this <hi>purity,</hi> will <hi>love</hi> her, loving her will <hi>possess</hi> her, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing her will <hi>inrich</hi> her with his <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> according to his <hi>divine will</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.</hi> Therefore in the <hi>acquisition</hi> of true and solid <hi>piety,</hi> we must not study so much to <hi>do</hi> as to <hi>take away,</hi> nor <hi>labour</hi> so much to <hi>acquire</hi> and act, as to <hi>devest our selves,</hi> and do nothing <hi>displeasing to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other <hi>point</hi> is, when we say that we must do <hi>nothing to displease God;</hi> by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, we shew what the <hi>duty</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> is,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29616:171"/>
that will live in <hi>Christian purity,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in that she is obliged to <hi>regard God,</hi> and the <hi>good pleasure</hi> of God in all <hi>her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The <hi>reason</hi> of this duty is grounded in that we are <hi>not</hi> for <hi>our selves,</hi> neither our <hi>life</hi> nor <hi>actions,</hi> but we are <hi>for God,</hi> by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we must employ our life, actions, and selves for God. For this reason, God demands an account, even to the least <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our <hi>time,</hi> unto the least <hi>thought</hi> of our <hi>heart,</hi> the slightest <hi>word</hi> of our <hi>tongue,</hi> and to the smallest <hi>action</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi> In brief, he will demand an account of our selves <hi>from</hi> our selves, because that we being not our <hi>own</hi> but Gods, we must employ our selves all for God, for his <hi>good pleasure</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi> He that will examine the <hi>precept of love,</hi> will inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously confess that which we say, for we cannot <hi>love God with all our heart, with all our soul, and withall our strength,</hi> but in seeking to please him in <hi>all</hi> things, even the <hi>least,</hi> much more in those which we call <hi>indifferent,</hi> though in <hi>truth</hi> they are not so, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Christian</hi> must avoid in his <hi>actions,</hi> the <hi>multiplicity</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi> which occurs ordinarily in <hi>affaires,</hi> even in those which are good and appear <hi>charitable,</hi> and above all, he must exempt himself from that which concerns him not, and is not of his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:29616:171"/>
                  <hi>office,</hi> nor suitable to his <hi>profession</hi> and <hi>voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and especially those which are above his <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> This <hi>advice</hi> is to be weighed and cleared, for the most <hi>serious</hi> may be deceived, and the most <hi>zealous</hi> may lose themselves in their <hi>occupations</hi>; by this <hi>way</hi> the Devill withdrawes away many <hi>souls</hi> from <hi>vertue</hi> and the <hi>purity</hi> of their <hi>vocation.</hi> It is easie for us to be lost in this <hi>snare,</hi> if we have not a <hi>pure regard</hi> of God, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <hi>vigilancy,</hi> we fall ordinarily into this <hi>evill.</hi> Sometimes a <hi>false zeal</hi> of <hi>charity</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports us, sometimes we are seduced by <hi>complacency,</hi> sometimes by <hi>curiosity</hi> and our own <hi>inclination,</hi> which is much given to <hi>change</hi> and <hi>variety,</hi> and takes pleasure in all that it employes it self in, busies it self therein with much <hi>content,</hi> fastens it self thereto, insomuch, that the <hi>soul</hi> becomes at last so disordered that she finds no more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> in her <hi>spirit,</hi> no more <hi>attention</hi> in her <hi>self,</hi> but feels her <hi>self</hi> wholly estranged from God, even in the most <hi>holy exercises</hi> of her <hi>vocation.</hi> Being in this <hi>condition,</hi> she is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, and this <hi>disquiet</hi> causes a <hi>distaste</hi> and <hi>alienation</hi> from <hi>vertue,</hi> whereupon losing the reins, she more and more abandons her self to <hi>exteriour things,</hi> and infallibly loseth her self, if she have not a care to withdraw her self in good time, and if God preserve her
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:29616:172"/>
not, and behold her with the eye of <hi>mercy.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> therefore that seeks <hi>perfection,</hi> and the inward <hi>peace</hi> of the heart, must be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant herein, and not suffer her self to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately transported</hi> under any <hi>pretence</hi> whatsoever, for it concerns her <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>state</hi> of <hi>true love</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> alwayes withdrawes the <hi>soul</hi> from all <hi>multiplicity,</hi> and separates her from all things; for <hi>so much</hi> as she hath of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace, so far</hi> is she sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and estranged from the <hi>Creature,</hi> and the more she is to God, the more she flyes and detests <hi>all things else</hi>; the more <hi>grace</hi> raigns in her, the more it separates her from her <hi>self</hi> and the <hi>world. Self-love</hi> drawes us to the <hi>Creature,</hi> and involves us in a <hi>multiplicity</hi>; on the contrary, the <hi>love of God</hi> separates us from the <hi>Creature,</hi> and puts us into <hi>unity.</hi> This most true <hi>principle,</hi> may serve us as a <hi>plummet</hi> to sound the <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>interiour</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> He who is subject to <hi>grace,</hi> and hath but any <hi>pure love,</hi> needs not to be perswaded to this, because the <hi>love of God</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> makes him hate, fly, and detest both the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>affaires</hi> of it, and assuredly, he will shew it by the <hi>effects,</hi> for he cannot do otherwise. Whence it will be hard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>opinion</hi> of those, who would be truly devout, and perswade themselves they
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:29616:172"/>
have true <hi>Christian piety,</hi> yet charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with <hi>cares,</hi> with <hi>affaires</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> perplexing themselves in <hi>thoughts, desire,</hi> and bringing about divers <hi>designes.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and <hi>enlighten</hi> them if they be capable, we must resume our <hi>principle,</hi> and onely say to them, that the <hi>love of God</hi> speaks <hi>unity,</hi> and the <hi>love of our selves multiplicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are many <hi>actions</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in many <hi>affaires</hi> wherewith we cannot dispense for that they are necessary, and wherein our <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> may be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and content. But we must renounce this <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> for God must have all our <hi>actions,</hi> and to do <hi>Christianly</hi> and <hi>purely,</hi> we must do it onely for <hi>his good pleasure,</hi> so that if we mingle with it other <hi>pretences</hi> or <hi>contentments,</hi> it is not <hi>purely for God,</hi> but we share with God, and we <hi>rob him</hi> of all that <hi>part</hi> that we take therein. But if the <hi>actions</hi> we do be <hi>naturall,</hi> as to eat, sleep, and the like, we must not fulfill them by the <hi>instinct</hi> and <hi>appetite</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> which forces us to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie both her <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> but we must perform them out of a <hi>pure desire</hi> to do the <hi>will of God,</hi> which obligeth us to this <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;</hi> this <hi>desire</hi> must be exclusive, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>instinct</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> For in <hi>actions</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and necessary, there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>action</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:29616:173"/>
The <hi>rule</hi> is humane and <hi>naturall,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> must alwayes be <hi>supernaturall,</hi> as for example. We do some <hi>necessary act,</hi> as to eat, sleep, or the like, the <hi>necessity</hi> is the <hi>rule,</hi> but God must be the <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>action,</hi> for he is the <hi>end</hi> of all the <hi>actions</hi> of man, both <hi>free</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> and we are obliged to direct all our <hi>actions</hi> to their <hi>supernaturall ends,</hi> it is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, let all be done to the glory of God.</hi> This <hi>truth</hi> is most evident, for if God were not the <hi>end</hi> of such <hi>actions,</hi> it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be, that man himself is the <hi>end</hi> thereof, which would be a kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> to affirm. We must then conclude and say with the Apostle, <hi>Whatsoever ye do in word or deed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>do all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> In all lawfull <hi>actions,</hi> therefore we must regard the <hi>rule</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>necessity,</hi> which must be no other then the <hi>good pleasure</hi> and <hi>pure will</hi> of God. But if in these <hi>actions</hi> there should happen some <hi>displeasure,</hi> as if they should be contrary to our <hi>Honour,</hi> or if they be full of <hi>bitterness,</hi> then we must couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously embrace them, and with an <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>love</hi> ready for the displeasure which might happen, offering our selves to God to be filled with <hi>bitterness,</hi> as often and as long as it shall please his <hi>divine Majesty;</hi> So in all
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29616:173"/>
the <hi>actions</hi> of man wherein he may take <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> or <hi>displeasure,</hi> in what manner soever they are, we may frame <hi>three acts. The first</hi> is an <hi>act of obedience,</hi> making such an <hi>action</hi> very naturall and necessary by <hi>submission</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>pure will of God,</hi> who hath ordained all things after the best <hi>manner</hi> that best <hi>pleaseth</hi> him. The <hi>second</hi> is of <hi>abnegation,</hi> renouncing the <hi>pleasure,</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting</hi> the <hi>displeasure</hi> which may be therein. The <hi>third</hi> of <hi>resignation,</hi> giving our selves up to the <hi>will of God,</hi> to be in a continuall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of <hi>displeasure,</hi> if it shall so happen, and that for <hi>as long,</hi> and in <hi>what manner</hi> it shall <hi>please</hi> God; For the <hi>soul</hi> must have <hi>no will</hi> but to accept the <hi>will of</hi> God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we may fail, yet in the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>research</hi> of things, not onely <hi>lawfull,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>vertuous,</hi> by <hi>adherence</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. It is a <hi>fault</hi> ordinary enough, and which we must avoid, because our <hi>soul</hi> must be free and not tyed but to God onely and to his <hi>pure will.</hi> For as we ought to do nothing but <hi>for God,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit of Iesus Christ,</hi> which is the true and onely <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>; so we must not <hi>act</hi> by our own <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> or <hi>passions.</hi> Whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who <hi>employ</hi> themselves in those <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which they are most <hi>inclin'd</hi> to, and shun those they <hi>fear,</hi> and embrace most willingly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:29616:174"/>
the <hi>occupations</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> whereto their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> carrries them. Thus we see some have an <hi>inclination</hi> to <hi>exterior penitence,</hi> others to <hi>compassion,</hi> and some to <hi>penance</hi>; one is prone to the <hi>love</hi> of things <hi>regulated,</hi> another is <hi>pleased</hi> with <hi>solitude,</hi> and the like. And we know that ordinarily, every man follows the <hi>motions,</hi> and most willingly chooses the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> to <hi>live</hi> according to his <hi>inclination.</hi> It is a great <hi>advantage</hi> and <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>good soul,</hi> as the <hi>Wise man</hi> saith; but to embrace the <hi>good,</hi> and do it's <hi>actions,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>inclination</hi> or <hi>passion</hi> carries us thereto, though they be <hi>good,</hi> this is not to <hi>act Christianly</hi>; on the contrary, this is to <hi>live bruitishly,</hi> for beasts follow their <hi>passions</hi>; or at best, to <hi>act</hi> but <hi>humanely,</hi> when the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> is conformable to <hi>reason.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that wil do a <hi>Christian action,</hi> must take a <hi>supernaturall principle,</hi> which is <hi>grace,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do his <hi>actions,</hi> because <hi>passions</hi> and his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> carry him thereto, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon him, and because such <hi>actions</hi> are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he that will <hi>live Christianly,</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver undertake any thing which he <hi>believes</hi> is not the <hi>will of God;</hi> if he do any <hi>good action,</hi> he must do it <hi>for God</hi>; if he choose a <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of life, he shall <hi>regard God</hi> onely, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29616:174"/>
strive to do only what is most <hi>perfect</hi> in him, most <hi>conformable</hi> to the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and most <hi>contrary</hi> to his own <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> and <hi>naturall affections.</hi> But if he find himself in <hi>doubt,</hi> or <hi>perplexity,</hi> and if he <hi>desire</hi> to judge his <hi>actions,</hi> his <hi>resentments,</hi> and <hi>intentions,</hi> to know if they be <hi>good,</hi> and truly <hi>Christian,</hi> then shall he have <hi>recourse</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the chief <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>actions;</hi> he shall demand <hi>light</hi> of him, and taking <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for the <hi>object</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> for his <hi>rule,</hi> he shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether his <hi>intentions</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> be conformable to the <hi>truth,</hi> whether they be like to those of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> whether he <hi>act</hi> in the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> that <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him according to his <hi>vocation,</hi> and conformable to the <hi>sanctity</hi> of the <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> living in this <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> shall become <hi>acceptable</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> shall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the <hi>perfection</hi> which <hi>God</hi> requires of him, and shall do all his <hi>actions</hi> with the <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> he ought, which is the <hi>Principall point</hi> of a <hi>Christian life.</hi>

He that will <hi>live per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> must know the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other</hi>; as he must <hi>act Christianly,</hi> so must he <hi>suffer Christianly,</hi> that is, <hi>holily,</hi> and in a manner, <hi>worthy</hi> the <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Christianity. This</hi> is that which we have left to <hi>examine,</hi> and is the last <hi>draught</hi> of the <hi>Picture</hi> of a <hi>perfect Christian.</hi> We have already spoken of his <hi>foundation,</hi> of his <hi>interiour,</hi> of the <hi>purity</hi> of his <hi>actions</hi>; it remains that we treat now of his <hi>sufferings.</hi> This is a <hi>point</hi> which we must look upon as the most <hi>essentiall</hi> in <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; for <hi>suffering</hi> is the <hi>first state</hi> which a <hi>Christian</hi> must expect, and wherein he is to continue. We are born in <hi>sufferings,</hi> we <hi>live</hi> in <hi>solitude</hi> among <hi>temptations,</hi> and shall <hi>die</hi> in <hi>pain.</hi> It is the <hi>portion</hi> of <hi>humane life,</hi> the most ordinary <hi>food</hi> of our <hi>souls.</hi> It behooves us therefore to know how to make <hi>use</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> thereof. He hath made a great <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> in <hi>perfection</hi> who can suffer, and bear
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29616:175"/>
couragiously all that can befall him, such a one God owns as a <hi>friend. Fire</hi> tries <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> but men are tried in the <hi>Furnace</hi> of <hi>humiliation.</hi> Here the <hi>fidelity</hi> of our <hi>soul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; for the <hi>Christian</hi> ought to follow <hi>Christ</hi> as willingly to <hi>mount Calvary,</hi> as to <hi>mount Thabor.</hi> In brief, here the <hi>purity</hi> of our <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> do best appear what we do of <hi>our selves,</hi> be it in <hi>penitence, good works,</hi> or otherwise, is for the most part full of our own <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows our <hi>inclinations,</hi> it is in regard of our <hi>selves,</hi> and our own <hi>Interests</hi> proportioned to <hi>self-love,</hi> and for the most part concerns <hi>our selves.</hi> But in all that happens to us, we shall find nothing but God, if we know how to lay hold of him, when he puts forth his hand unto us.</p>
               <p>To learn so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we must propose these <hi>truths</hi> for a <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. First,</hi> if we consider God, as soon as his wife <hi>providence</hi> embraced all the <hi>world,</hi> his <hi>divine eyes</hi> surveigh'd all things, his infinite <hi>wisdom</hi> ordained the whole; and his <hi>wisdom,</hi> sayes the <hi>Wise man,</hi> stayes in his force from one end to the other, and <hi>sweetly disposes all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. 8.1.</note> and he not onely <hi>ordains</hi> and <hi>disposes</hi> all, but he makes all the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>evil, life</hi> and <hi>death, poverty</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> come from <hi>God.</hi> Now, the <hi>works</hi> of God are holy, his <hi>will</hi> is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29616:176"/>
just, his <hi>decrces</hi> equitable, his <hi>ordinances</hi> ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and above all things we must <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>seek</hi> his <hi>good pleasure.</hi> What remains then, but that we receive all things from the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly</hi> and loving <hi>hand of God,</hi> that we kiss the <hi>hand</hi> that strikes, since it is the <hi>hand of God,</hi> that we bear with an humble and quiet <hi>submission</hi> all <hi>events,</hi> be they painfull or easie, good or bad, prejudiciall or profitable? and we must entertain them not onely with an <hi>equality</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>inward peace,</hi> but with <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>essence,</hi> as coming <hi>from God,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being done but by his <hi>order.</hi> It is just we should <hi>esteem</hi> this <hi>conduct</hi> as the <hi>conduct</hi> of God, and subject our selves to it, not onely with <hi>patience,</hi> but with <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> for all that comes from God, must be highly <hi>esteemed. Souls</hi> that <hi>live enlightened</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> with the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> hold it a great <hi>honour,</hi> and much <hi>esteem sufferings,</hi> as being the <hi>work</hi> of God, and the effects of his <hi>will,</hi> which we ought to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>esteem,</hi> as well in <hi>sufferings</hi> as in <hi>quiet,</hi> in <hi>privation,</hi> as well as <hi>fruition,</hi> in <hi>evil,</hi> as in <hi>good;</hi> for in all, it is the <hi>will of God,</hi> a will <hi>adorable,</hi> to be <hi>esteemed</hi> above all the <hi>world,</hi> a <hi>will</hi> more <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> then the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> of all <hi>mankind.</hi> We must not regard the <hi>evils</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> in themselves, but we must consider them in the <hi>will of God</hi>; There we shall see what
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:29616:176"/>
they are, and the <hi>esteem</hi> that God makes of them. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> wills his <hi>Apostles,</hi> speaking to them of <hi>sufferings,</hi> to receive them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>fear,</hi> and with <hi>esteem,</hi> and wills, that they be unto them <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>pleasing</hi>;<note place="margin">Luke 12.4</note> 
                  <hi>Because,</hi> saith he, <hi>the hairs of your head are numbred, and not one of them shall fall to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of your Father:</hi> He said, <hi>that God is our Father,</hi> to engrave in our <hi>hearts</hi> a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, confidence,</hi> and <hi>love</hi>; He sayes, <hi>that our hairs are numbred,</hi> and that he keeps an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of them to perswade us, that Gods <hi>care</hi> of us is great, and that he hath a <hi>care</hi> of us, even to the <hi>least things.</hi> In brief, he saith, <hi>that a hair shall not fall to the ground without his order,</hi> to shew that all the <hi>losses, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, sufferings,</hi> all <hi>events,</hi> loss of <hi>goods,</hi> of <hi>honour,</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> happen not but by the <hi>order</hi> of God who is <hi>our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What greater <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>esteem sufferings,</hi> and to <hi>conduct</hi> our <hi>souls</hi> to <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>repose</hi> amidst the <hi>perplexities</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> then the <hi>assurance of Iesus Christ?</hi> It is enough for a <hi>Christian</hi> (if he be a <hi>Christian</hi>) when <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> sayes to him, <hi>Fear not, for a hair shall not fall to the ground without your Father</hi>; how full of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>consolation</hi> are the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>I beseech you that you walk worthy the vocation wherewith ye are called</hi>: The <hi>Reason</hi> he adds; <hi>There is
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29616:177"/>
but one Lord, one faith, one Baptisme, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> These words are sufficient to establish us christianly in the spirit of <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> and to make us to bear all with sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, peace and <hi>tranquillity</hi> of spirit, even with <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>respect.</hi> We need no other <hi>object</hi> for our <hi>eyes,</hi> nor other <hi>thought</hi> in our <hi>heart,</hi> but there is but <hi>one Lord,</hi> this Lord is <hi>God,</hi> this God is our <hi>Father,</hi> this Father is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all.</hi> In these words we shall learn in what <hi>respect, subjection</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> we ought to be in all the contrarieties and <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>humane life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We may look upon the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and examine what is the <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of the true spirit of <hi>piety</hi>; we shall find that <hi>sufferings</hi> is the principall, its <hi>life,</hi> and its <hi>continuance,</hi> and its <hi>maintenance. My Son,</hi> sayes the wise man,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.1.</note> going to the service of God, <hi>keep thy self just and in fear, and prepare thy soul to temptation,</hi> adding, <hi>Take all that shall be imposed on thee, suffer pain with patience and humility.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> more clearly describes this, when speaking of the <hi>persecutions</hi> he had suffered,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.12.</note> he adds, <hi>And all those</hi> also, <hi>who will live godly in Iesus Christ, shall suffer persecution,</hi> which must be understood of all <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>sufferings,</hi> both <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> For the life of a <hi>Christian,</hi> is no other
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:29616:177"/>
then the life of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the spirit of <hi>Christianity.</hi> This is the spirit of <hi>Iesus,</hi> or in the common phrase, the <hi>spirit of grace.</hi> Jesus was alwayes in <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi>; he <hi>loved</hi> from all eternity, seeing that from all eternity he was resolved to <hi>be man</hi>; he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invested therein <hi>becoming man, humiliation</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> were the centre of his life. It is enough to honour pains, humiliation and sufferings, to say that <hi>Iesus Christ hath born them</hi>; and as the <hi>Christian</hi> must be the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so must he bear with <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> all sorts of commotions, pains, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations and sufferings.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.49.</note> 
                  <hi>As we have born the earthly Image of the earthly</hi> Adam, let us <hi>also bear the image of the heavenly,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> meaning that we must reinvest us with his <hi>Vertues,</hi> that <hi>our life</hi> may be an express <hi>image</hi> of <hi>his life,</hi> which appearing alwayes in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, lowness</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> so ours must be but the same <hi>state</hi> of <hi>sufferings.</hi> What honour is it to a <hi>Christian</hi> to weare the <hi>Livery</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> what happiness to follow his <hi>steps?</hi> we are his <hi>members,</hi> he is our <hi>Head</hi>; were it not a shame to see the <hi>body</hi> decked with <hi>flowers,</hi> bathed in <hi>delights,</hi> and the <hi>head</hi> crowned with <hi>Thorns</hi>? we are his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and must possess one <hi>heritage</hi> with him; is it not reason then that we should be like him, and imitate his <hi>conflicts,</hi> if we would parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:29616:178"/>
of his <hi>Triumphs? We are co-heires with Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 8.17.</note> saith the <hi>Apostle, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.</hi> Whatsoever it be, the Sonne of God hath so ordered it in <hi>Christianity,</hi> that he that will <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him,</hi> must <hi>renounce himself,</hi> and take up his <hi>Crosse.</hi> They are deceived, who think to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>true piety</hi> with <hi>delights,</hi> who refuse all sorts of <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>mortifications,</hi> who take care for peace, repose and health, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly study to frame to themselves an <hi>easie life</hi>; and seek for <hi>ease</hi> in their <hi>labours,</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> in their <hi>spirits,</hi> and think thereby to make a great progress in <hi>perfection.</hi> No no! <hi>vertue</hi> walks onely amongst the <hi>thorns</hi>; and amidst the travails of the spirit of <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi> She must tame her self by <hi>watchings</hi> and <hi>mortifications</hi>; and the <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> is onely in the <hi>Crosse.</hi> It is the <hi>Livery</hi> of the Children of God, the mark of their <hi>election,</hi> the <hi>Plummet</hi> of their <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and the onely <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>; for saith St. <hi>Paul, We must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The third reason is, that the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> can operate no other <hi>effect</hi> then <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation</hi> and suffering, for to be <hi>in grace,</hi> is to be <hi>subject to graces,</hi> and to be in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of grace, that is to be in the <hi>Crosse.</hi> For <hi>so much</hi> as the <hi>soul</hi> hath of <hi>grace, so much</hi> she
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29616:178"/>
must have of the <hi>Crosse.</hi> The Fathers of the Church call the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> a <hi>hidden Martyrdom,</hi> which is easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if we consider that the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> consisteth in a <hi>crucifying love,</hi> a love like that of the <hi>spouse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5.8.</note> who cryes, <hi>I charge you O ye Daughters of Ierusalem, if you find my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that you tell him, that I am sick of love,</hi> love which <hi>pierceth</hi> the <hi>soul,</hi> which <hi>transports</hi> and <hi>transforms</hi> it into its <hi>object Iesus</hi>; love which combates <hi>sufferings,</hi> and triumphs over <hi>death.</hi> Behold this <hi>combate</hi> of <hi>love.</hi> God loves us, gives us his love, makes us suffer to prove the <hi>faithfulness</hi> of our love; the soul that suffereth <hi>because she loves,</hi> willingly throwes her self into <hi>sufferings,</hi> and defies all <hi>labours,</hi> that in her sufferings she may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> her <hi>love. Iesus</hi> did so at the evening of his <hi>death,</hi> when he went to <hi>sacrifice</hi> himself upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> when he said to his Apostles,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.31.</note> 
                  <hi>To the end, the World may know that I love my Father, and do as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, arise and let us go hence,</hi> whence he went to the Garden of <hi>Olives,</hi> to <hi>deliver himself</hi> willingly into the <hi>hands</hi> of his <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> where he shewed that <hi>love</hi> was the <hi>cause</hi> of his <hi>sufferings,</hi> his <hi>sufferings</hi> the <hi>marks</hi> of his <hi>love.</hi> Howsoever it be, to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> and not to love <hi>God,</hi> cannot stand together, and to <hi>love God,</hi> and not to <hi>suffer</hi> is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:29616:179"/>The <hi>spirit,</hi> and the proper <hi>grace</hi> of the state of <hi>Christianity,</hi> puts us into this <hi>necessity</hi>; for the <hi>first</hi> and most <hi>inseparable effect</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> is to <hi>destroy</hi> in us the <hi>old man,</hi> and to <hi>crucifie</hi> him, there to make the <hi>new man</hi> to <hi>live,</hi> who according to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> is no other then <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and we know that <hi>grace</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>destroy</hi> our evill <hi>inclinations,</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> will <hi>purifie</hi> and consume, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he pleases, and as much as <hi>he will,</hi> the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> who is in <hi>us,</hi> there to <hi>establish</hi> a <hi>being</hi> and a <hi>life</hi> of God. Now this cannot be but by <hi>sufferings,</hi> by <hi>subversions,</hi> and by a <hi>long</hi> and painfull <hi>death,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> said to the <hi>Galatians, Those that are of Iesus Christ have crucify'd the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> the sins, the passions and concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, shewing that <hi>those</hi> who are Gods, and in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> are <hi>crucify'd,</hi> and must necessarily <hi>be</hi> in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>subversions.</hi> And immediately after, he tells us, that we are <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Children of God,</hi> not onely to <hi>live</hi> in this <hi>estate,</hi> but withall, by a <hi>necessity</hi> so <hi>absolute,</hi> that we may say, that <hi>those</hi> who are <hi>belonging</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> are <hi>known</hi> to be <hi>such,</hi> because they have <hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>mortified</hi> their <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> more then <hi>those</hi> who have not <hi>mortification,</hi> and who avoid and <hi>neglect it,</hi> and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29616:179"/>
long not to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> The conclusion is manifest in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who said, <hi>If any of you have not the spirit of Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>he is none of his.</hi> Now this <hi>spirit</hi> is no other then the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>sufferings, subversions, contrarieties, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> and the <hi>Crosse,</hi> and therefore he that will be <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> must resolve to suffer, and though he be not oblig'd to <hi>demand</hi> it of God, yet he must <hi>embrace</hi> it with <hi>esteem,</hi> and receive it with <hi>love</hi> and courage, when it befalls him, for that it is necessary to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish him in <hi>vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may see what <hi>deceipt</hi> is crept into <hi>Christians,</hi> who making <hi>profession</hi> of some <hi>piety,</hi> instead of <hi>profiting</hi> by sufferings, and receiving them with <hi>esteem</hi> have no greater care then to exempt themselves from them, seeking nothing but their own <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward content,</hi> and labouring to live in a satisfaction and <hi>repose of spirit,</hi> they fly all sorts of <hi>pains,</hi> and remove themselves as much as they can from all <hi>trouble,</hi> be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>little,</hi> and renounce and avoid all <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations</hi> and <hi>occasions</hi> that may mortifie them, and if they cannot help themselves, nor find any <hi>remedy,</hi> then there is nothing but <hi>vexation of spirit,</hi> murmuring in their <hi>hearts,</hi> impatient in their <hi>words,</hi> and excessive in their <hi>plaints,</hi> suffering themselves to fall into a <hi>dulness</hi> and <hi>weakness,</hi> unworthy a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:29616:180"/>
To live so as to become <hi>uncapable</hi> of any <hi>solid vertues</hi> is the <hi>mark</hi> of a <hi>heart</hi> which is <hi>not Gods,</hi> and of a <hi>soul</hi> which loves but <hi>it self.</hi> Let us then hearken to the <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi>

               <p>One of the greatest is, a <hi>fear</hi> to suffer <hi>pains,</hi> an apprehension of <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For commonly, we stand in fear of <hi>crosses</hi> and <hi>travails, self-love</hi> causing us to shun all that <hi>humbles</hi> us, making us to fly what ever is <hi>low,</hi> and hindring us from embracing any thing that is <hi>difficult.</hi> This <hi>fear</hi> is a great <hi>obstacle</hi> to <hi>vertue,</hi> which cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd but by <hi>travel,</hi> nor preserv'd but by <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glancy,</hi> nor <hi>perfected</hi> but in <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> it is the common <hi>resentment</hi> of all men. We see also by experience, that he who <hi>fears labour</hi> and <hi>suffering,</hi> often fails of <hi>goodness,</hi> and willingly renounces it, when he finds any trouble to conserve it. He easily quits the <hi>rudder</hi> when he sees the least <hi>storm</hi> of <hi>temptation,</hi> or opposite <hi>action</hi> arise, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then suffer <hi>humiliation,</hi> he will quit <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and if there be occasion, renounce his <hi>portion</hi> of <hi>Paradise,</hi> rather then the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> and <hi>content</hi> he takes in doing his own
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29616:181"/>
                  <hi>will,</hi> rather then his own <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>repose.</hi> We see the greatest part of <hi>Christians</hi> dare not enter into <hi>consideration</hi> of their <hi>lives past,</hi> nor reflect seriously on their <hi>sins,</hi> nor think of <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>future estate</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> meerly by reason of <hi>fear</hi> to suffer <hi>sorrow</hi> for their <hi>sins.</hi> That they may not be sensible of the <hi>apprehension</hi> they ought to have of God's <hi>Iudgements,</hi> they will not so much as <hi>think</hi> thereon. Hereupon they persevere in their <hi>malice,</hi> and remain finally <hi>obstinate</hi> in their <hi>sins,</hi> living in <hi>ignorance</hi> of things necessary to <hi>salvation</hi>; so true it is that the least <hi>fear</hi> of pains withdraws them from <hi>vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To see how much this <hi>fear</hi> is prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, let us consider that to the <hi>acquisition</hi> and <hi>conservation</hi> of <hi>vertues</hi> two things are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary which require both <hi>travel</hi> and <hi>pain.</hi> First, we must destroy ill <hi>habits,</hi> next, we must acquire vertuous <hi>habits</hi>; We cannot <hi>ruine</hi> the <hi>evil</hi> without <hi>mortification,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi>; we cannot root them out without <hi>privation</hi> and <hi>resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> wherein is both <hi>travel</hi> and the <hi>cross.</hi> But if we will obtain good <hi>habits,</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise <hi>Christian vertues,</hi> and all in <hi>grace,</hi> then we must have a great <hi>care, vigilancy</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>courage</hi> to resist all <hi>oppositions,</hi> that <hi>nature, inclinations,</hi> or <hi>occasions</hi> present unto us.

they shut their <hi>heart</hi> against <hi>love,</hi> and which is more to be lamented, go out of the <hi>order of God,</hi> and from the <hi>conformity,</hi> they ought to have with <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> crucified, who is the <hi>object,</hi> the <hi>way,</hi> and the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>perfect Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who cannot <hi>conduct</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> but in the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>annihilating,</hi> of suffering and humiliation, which is the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>essence.</hi> Here may these <hi>delicate persons</hi> see how their <hi>faint-heartedness</hi> deceives them.

               <p>Herein also appeares the <hi>wrong</hi> that the <hi>fear</hi> of suffering causeth to Christians, How much do souls separate themselves from God, who seek no other <hi>consolation,</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and enjoyment but their own, and labour onely to put themselves into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>repose,</hi> thinking that <hi>perfection</hi> consists in this false <hi>rest,</hi> and never to suffer any <hi>crosse, affliction</hi> or <hi>temptation.</hi> No no, <hi>Earth</hi> is the place of <hi>combate; Christian life</hi> is the <hi>death</hi> of man; <hi>perfect love,</hi> like the <hi>Phenix,</hi> seeks <hi>death,</hi> and findes <hi>life</hi> in the same <hi>flames</hi>; the <hi>Crosse</hi> gave <hi>grace,</hi> grace now giveth the <hi>crosse,</hi> the sacred <hi>spouse</hi> saith, she is <hi>fair</hi> but <hi>brown,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If then the Christian will love, if he will be subject to the <hi>Kingdom of grace,</hi> he must defie all sufferings, and couragiously em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all that shall befall him, for love over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes all, and triumphs over the soul.

                  <hi>comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love.</hi> The greatness of God, the infinity of his <hi>being,</hi> his divine <hi>spirit</hi> are so powerful, that if he never so little communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the <hi>soul</hi> by the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> He is able to annihilate and consume her. For if he apply himself to the <hi>Creature,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29616:183"/>
proportioning himself to its <hi>capacity,</hi> he cannot be supported, for he overwhelms and ruines the created, being by this <hi>power</hi> infinite, and infinitely predominating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>being</hi> so small, so subjected to his <hi>power.</hi> In fine, it would swallow up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it, if he did not proportion his <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to our <hi>weakness,</hi> and if he gave us not a <hi>capacity</hi> and force to bear it. But whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he doth, if he communicate himself, he alwayes annihilates, if he giveth <hi>grace,</hi> he changeth the <hi>man,</hi> if he giveth <hi>light,</hi> he humbles him, if he make him to bear his <hi>love</hi> he wounds him. Thus the <hi>soul</hi> that will <hi>love</hi> God, must <hi>love</hi> sufferings; he that will love the life of <hi>grace,</hi> must lose himself, and <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate</hi> himself to receive <hi>divine operations.</hi> He that will beare the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> must hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself, seeing God doth not manifest himself but to the <hi>humble</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> and that all the <hi>works</hi> of God bear his Crosse in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Hence we learn, that it is necessary we esteem the <hi>Crosse</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them with <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>fervour</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> but we must further observe that <hi>sufferings, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, losses</hi> and <hi>humiliations,</hi> and other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of humane life, are necessary to a <hi>Christian,</hi> to keep him steadfast amidst the <hi>deceits</hi> and <hi>blandishments</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>subtleties</hi> and <hi>surprizes</hi> of the Devill. By these
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29616:184"/>
wayes which we call <hi>rigorous,</hi> God severs us from the <hi>world,</hi> and takes us from <hi>kindness</hi> to the <hi>creatures</hi>; he makes use of these <hi>losses</hi> and <hi>subversions</hi> as of gall and bitterness to <hi>mingle</hi> with the sweets that the <hi>creatures</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to us. He uses <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>affliction</hi> to abate our <hi>pride</hi>; and if he do leave us for a time, it is to <hi>humble</hi> us, and in all this, he is most mercifull to us, whereof they are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi> who fear <hi>sufferings,</hi> and for <hi>love</hi> of themselves, oppose the <hi>love</hi> that God bears them, and <hi>destroy</hi> what God would do for their good.</p>
               <p>Moreover by these <hi>losses</hi> and <hi>eversions,</hi> by <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>humiliations, privations</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negations,</hi> God delivers us from the nets and snares of the <hi>Devil.</hi> This <hi>enemy</hi> of our <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> seldom tempts us but in the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and our own <hi>inclinations,</hi> he makes use of the <hi>love</hi> of our selves against our selves. Now he is unable to do us <hi>evil,</hi> and is deceived in his <hi>malice.</hi> When God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to <hi>annihilate</hi> us, and put us into the <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>suffering,</hi> of <hi>desertion,</hi> of <hi>humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; or when of our <hi>selves</hi> we give our <hi>selves</hi> to the study of <hi>mortifications,</hi> to <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>humility</hi> and to the practice of the <hi>spirit,</hi> of <hi>repentance;</hi> for through these <hi>mortifications,</hi> we destroy in us whatsoever is <hi>evil,</hi> and pluck from our <hi>selves</hi> that which serves as

an instrument of the <hi>Devil</hi> to loose us and deceive us.</p>
               <p>In fine, by <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>humiliations,</hi> we put our <hi>selves</hi> out of hazard, and are shield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dangerous <hi>darts,</hi> and most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>temptations</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> because it is a thing so <hi>noble</hi> and so <hi>worthy</hi> to <hi>suffer,</hi> and to <hi>suffer</hi> in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> that it is above <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp; the common <hi>order.</hi> Whence it comes to pass, that the <hi>Devil,</hi> who cannot <hi>tempt,</hi> but according to the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> knows not how to take the <hi>soul</hi> that <hi>lives</hi> in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>sufferance,</hi> and of the <hi>cross.</hi> But if he will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault her, (as he will not fail to do) it will be against her <hi>sufferings,</hi> endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy in the <hi>soul</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>cross,</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting to her <hi>temptations</hi> of <hi>impatience,</hi> of <hi>envy,</hi> of <hi>vexation,</hi> giving her occasion to make ill use thereof.

               <p>Reflecting upon what we have said, we see it is a great <hi>impediment</hi> to the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> to decline <hi>sufferings,</hi> and not to <hi>care</hi>

                  <hi>it was necessary that temptation should try thee.</hi> This is evident, that the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>sufferings</hi> is necessary, and how much it imports us to <hi>esteem</hi> of them, to <hi>hear</hi> them with <hi>affection,</hi> and make use of them with <hi>profit,</hi> for God hath greater <hi>designes</hi> over <hi>souls</hi> by <hi>sufferings,</hi> then by all other wayes of <hi>grace</hi> that we could <hi>represent,</hi> it is the <hi>state</hi> that most <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>holily</hi> honours his <hi>divine being</hi>; it is the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity;</hi> in brief,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:29616:186"/>
it is the <hi>life</hi> of man, and therefore he must know how to <hi>drink</hi> of the cup of <hi>blessing,</hi> he must learn to <hi>ascend</hi> the ladder that reacheth from <hi>earth</hi> to the arms of God. And to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>our selves</hi> thereto with <hi>method</hi> and <hi>facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> we will divide this matter into three <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> which accompany our <hi>sufferings,</hi> and the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> in her <hi>crosses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We may suffer according to <hi>divine</hi> wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the <hi>zeal</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> against <hi>sin.</hi> In these three <hi>Dispositions</hi> we shall find all the rest. To <hi>suffer</hi> according to <hi>divine</hi> ways belongs onely to <hi>souls</hi> who are truly Gods, who <hi>adhere</hi> to him, and are <hi>dissolved</hi> in his <hi>love.</hi> To suffer this way is wholly <hi>divine,</hi> he must be wholly God's, <hi>love</hi> nothing but God, and be in the <hi>pure regard</hi> of God. To have this <hi>Disposition perfect,</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> in its <hi>sufferings, eversions</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> and in all the <hi>contrarieties</hi> of <hi>humane life,</hi> must have no other thought nor <hi>interiour state,</hi> but to <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> because it is the pleasure of God she should <hi>suffer.</hi> This I call a <hi>pure regard</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> she suffers onely to praise God, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath <hi>delight</hi> to see her suffer, and wills that she should suffer. This Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the <hi>state</hi> that the <hi>Wise man</hi> calls the <hi>Sacrifice of the Holocaust,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. 3.6.</note> a sacrifice killed
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:29616:187"/>
and layd whole on the <hi>Altar</hi>; as the <hi>holocaust</hi> is all consumed and <hi>annihilated</hi> to the <hi>glory, content,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> alone, without the <hi>Creatures</hi> having any part therein; so the soul suffering in this <hi>pure regard</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices her self wholly to <hi>God,</hi> and is wholly consumed in the good pleasure of <hi>God,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her <hi>bringing</hi> or <hi>receiving</hi> any other <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thought</hi> or <hi>state</hi> wherein her <hi>happiness</hi> doth consist. For <hi>God</hi> seeing the soul suffer onely for his <hi>content</hi> and good pleasure, gives her a sufficiency and <hi>capacity</hi> to suffer with so much <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>amplitude,</hi> that she no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>regards</hi> what she suffers, nor thinks more of sufferings, but only <hi>thinks</hi> to do the good pleasure of <hi>God.</hi> So that she undergoes not sufferings with pain, but with <hi>love,</hi> and with a disposition that beares in it more of <hi>love</hi> then of sufferance in the suffering it self, resigning her self wholly to <hi>God,</hi> and to all the <hi>effects</hi> of his spirit and grace, how <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> soever they may be, thinking no more of sufferings, but <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>loving</hi>; and in this disposition, <hi>love</hi> is the <hi>life</hi> of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and sufferings are the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> of a <hi>love pure</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>suffer</hi> according to <hi>divine</hi> wayes, may yet be understood in another manner, when in <hi>sufferings, mortifications</hi> and <hi>humiliations,</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> is such to God, and so firmly <hi>united,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:29616:187"/>
that all things in the <hi>World</hi> are <hi>painfull</hi> to her, all is <hi>unsupportable</hi> to her, and her own body causes her to <hi>sigh</hi> and <hi>lament,</hi> saying with the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23</note> 
                  <hi>We groan within our selves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Every where she findes <hi>contrariety,</hi> and the more she <hi>lives</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the more she feels the weight of the <hi>Creature</hi>; all her <hi>repose</hi> is to be Gods, she seeks not, nor findes any thing but <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>contrariety,</hi> for she findes all her <hi>pleasure,</hi> all her repose and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be in the good <hi>pleasure</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>disposition</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> must be really lost in God, for she no more beares all the <hi>adversities</hi> of <hi>humane life,</hi> but according to the <hi>spirit</hi> of God with a <hi>divine patience,</hi> that is in the same manner that God beares them, or if you will in the <hi>spirit</hi> wherewith <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> suffered our <hi>nature,</hi> our <hi>sins</hi> and the <hi>Worlds,</hi> a patience which we must <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare them, but also (which is <hi>admirable</hi> in the excess of his <hi>love</hi>) gave his <hi>life,</hi> a <hi>divine life</hi> for our <hi>sins,</hi> and by the same <hi>patience,</hi> bearing the <hi>contrariety</hi> that his <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite essence</hi> hath to all <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>limited crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> he acted with the <hi>creature,</hi> laboured and died for it.</p>
               <p>This patience of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cause of our <hi>happiness,</hi> this patience
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:29616:188"/>
is the cause that all the <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> that ever were in the <hi>Church militant,</hi> have born all <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> with <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>meekness</hi>; this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must alwayes make us to <hi>suffer</hi> all the rigours of this <hi>life,</hi> but after a manner so much more <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> as the <hi>soul</hi> hath received of <hi>grace,</hi> and is advanced in the way of <hi>perfection,</hi> according to the measure that the <hi>soul</hi> is possessed of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to the same measure the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance,</hi> must be <hi>pure</hi> in her, and she must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main more resign'd to the <hi>designes</hi> of God, more divided from all <hi>Creatures.</hi> In this point consisteth the <hi>principall subject</hi> to be examined, whereby to know the <hi>fidelity</hi> of the <hi>soul.</hi> He that would know the way to make use of this <hi>divine spirit,</hi> must learn it of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the rule and example of our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> all that he did, all that he suffered, had relation to the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to the <hi>exaltation</hi> of his <hi>name,</hi> to the <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment</hi> of the Kingdom of God in our <hi>souls.</hi> In a word, he lived in the <hi>World,</hi> and dyed upon the <hi>Crosse,</hi> onely to do the good <hi>pleasure</hi> and will of his <hi>Father. My meat</hi> (said he to his <hi>Apostles</hi>) <hi>is to do the will of him that sent me</hi>:<note place="margin">Jo. 4.34.</note> This was the end of his coming and of his <hi>incarnation.</hi> Let us do the same, and remember, that as we must have <hi>purity</hi> of intention in all our <hi>actions,</hi> so
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29616:188"/>
must we in all our suffering, have a pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the will and good pleasure of God. When we shall <hi>suffer</hi> (whatsoever it be) let us <hi>suffer</hi> it, because God <hi>permits</hi> it, or so <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points</hi> it, or because he will shew his <hi>power</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and will be <hi>glorified</hi> in our <hi>subjection.</hi> Let us not regard our own <hi>interest,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue all things in respect of the <hi>glory</hi> of God. Let us endure them onely in regard of <hi>God,</hi> since it is his will, since he takes pleasure to see us in <hi>sufferings</hi> and in the <hi>Crosse,</hi> and that he will shew his power in our <hi>submission.</hi> Let us reduce all our <hi>intentions</hi> hither, they may be good, but this includes all the <hi>rest.</hi> In this <hi>disposition, Iesus Christ</hi> prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the <hi>Crosse,</hi> and presented himself to his <hi>Father,</hi> to be the <hi>offering</hi> and the <hi>sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>holocaust,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 26.43.</note> a <hi>propitiation</hi> for our <hi>sins.

               </p>
               <p>To this we must add a <hi>remarkable admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for those who will <hi>profit</hi> by <hi>sufferings, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations,</hi> and other <hi>adversities</hi> of humane <hi>life,</hi> and bear them with <hi>faithfulness.</hi> And that is this, that in all <hi>conditions</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> in all that may happen to us, we must <hi>endeavour</hi> to find out, if it be possible, the <hi>designes</hi> which God hath over us, in all that he <hi>does</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:29616:189"/>
to be done; and we are to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>receive</hi> them, and <hi>co-operate</hi> faithfully with them. For as God in all he <hi>does</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> hath alwayes some <hi>design</hi> worthy of his <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> so is it the duty of the <hi>soul</hi> to submit her self thereto, to <hi>subject</hi> her self according to all her <hi>capacity,</hi> that with an intire consent, she may act with God, if need be, and receive with fidelity all things according to the <hi>designes</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> of God: as for instance. There happens <hi>losses</hi> and <hi>ruines,</hi> we are to see if God by these losses, would separate and sever us from the <hi>Creatures.</hi> If it be so, we must accept them with this disposition, and make it our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to sever and <hi>deprive</hi> our selves of the <hi>love</hi> of all things created, because that by the losses and disgraces which befall us, we see that this is the design of God. Or else if by <hi>humiliations,</hi> and interiour or exteriour eversions, God will <hi>annihilate</hi> us, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to this <hi>annihilation,</hi> and applying our selves thereto, <hi>co-operate</hi> with the work of <hi>God,</hi> with all the <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> and so let us do in all, and according to the diversity of the <hi>objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This advice is not contrary to the <hi>pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> of God which we must have in all suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, for in the works of God, and in all that he <hi>permits,</hi> we must consider the <hi>end</hi> for
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29616:189"/>
which God does it, and the cause that moves him either to <hi>permit</hi> it or <hi>do it.</hi> The <hi>end</hi> of the works of God is his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> but the cause that moves him in his <hi>operations,</hi> and <hi>divine permissions,</hi> is the salvation of our souls, the <hi>establishment</hi> and <hi>communication</hi> of his spirit, his <hi>graces,</hi> and his <hi>vertues.</hi> We must here do as before, we must suffer, having no <hi>end</hi> but the pure regard of God, and of his <hi>glory.</hi> But because God requires <hi>fidelity,</hi> and will establish his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in our souls, it is also our duty to <hi>co-operate</hi> with his <hi>intentions,</hi> and to receive all things not onely because such is his good pleasure, but also in the manner that he will, and to make use thereof according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>perfection</hi> therefore of the spirit of sufferance, consisteth not in <hi>receiving</hi> all things <hi>indifferently</hi>; a soul is not <hi>perfect,</hi> though it be insensible of all <hi>accidents,</hi> be they never so sad and miserable. Perfection consists not in a <hi>Stoicall apathy,</hi> but if there be a <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> in <hi>suffering,</hi> it is when we receive all things in the <hi>spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>holy</hi> &amp; <hi>divine dispositions</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and that we bear them after that manner that God wills, and according to the <hi>designs</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> of God.

makes use of to teach us patience is, when he sayes, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> suffered for us, and that we must <hi>imitate</hi> him, and <hi>follow</hi> his steps, after this we cannot in reason find any thing hard.

How easie would all things appear, if in them we had no intent but to <hi>act</hi> and <hi>suffer</hi> onely to please God, with a full <hi>resignation</hi> of our selves, in all things to his <hi>divine conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To facilitate this <hi>disposition,</hi> and make it more generall, we must remember that the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God rules all this great <hi>World,</hi> and hath a generall and particular <hi>superintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> over all things. Nothing happens by <hi>chance</hi> to God, all is foreseen by his <hi>praesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and ruled by his <hi>providence.</hi> In this wise <hi>conduct</hi> he is Soveraign, and meanes to shew his <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> men to his <hi>will,</hi> and as <hi>Soveraign</hi> he disposes all, and as <hi>wise,</hi> he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains all, it belongs to him to <hi>ruine</hi> or <hi>build</hi> up, to <hi>advance</hi> or <hi>debase,</hi> and to us to <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> So that in <hi>disgraces</hi> and <hi>misfortunes,</hi> we must regard God as our <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and therefore must receive them with the greatest <hi>submission</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> which will that God <hi>dispose</hi> of all as he <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and that we receive all according to his <hi>dispensation.</hi> This is the <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> that God requires of us, whereby the most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> embrace all manner of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, acknowledging the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29616:197"/>
God, and confessing their dependance. I call this <hi>disposition, zeal to Iustice,</hi> because it is <hi>just</hi> that God should do in us, and with us, all that he pleases, and that we should be <hi>content</hi> in all things.</p>
               <p>This is so <hi>essentiall</hi> to man, so <hi>just</hi> in the disposall of the Universe, that we shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see in the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that that <hi>Soveraign Majesty</hi> will be acknowledged, and adored in <hi>afflictions</hi> with so much necessity, that he never stops the course of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> nor withholds <hi>sufferings</hi> and other <hi>pains,</hi> till the <hi>soul</hi> submit and freely render her self to <hi>God,</hi> and untill she do so <hi>submit</hi> her self, she will still be under the <hi>rod.</hi> So said <hi>Daniel,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the great <hi>Nebuchadnezar, God will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee,</hi>

                  <hi>till thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men.</hi> The impious <hi>Antiochus,</hi> made a publick confession, which the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as a Rack extorted from his guilty mouth, <hi>That truly it was a just thing to submit himself to God.</hi> The first <hi>disposition</hi> then wherein a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be in all <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>adversities,</hi> in all sorts of <hi>estates</hi> and <hi>chances,</hi> is to subject himself to God, <hi>because he is God.</hi> Upon this <hi>subjection,</hi> he must <hi>ground</hi> his desire and <hi>zeal,</hi> to abandon himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>divine justice,</hi> seeing all that is mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and painful in this <hi>World,</hi> is an effect of his <hi>justice,</hi> and the reward of sin, and we see
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:29616:198"/>
that all the <hi>chances</hi> that happen in this <hi>World</hi> are the effects of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>conduct.</hi>

               <p>This being supposed we are obliged to bear them, and receive them with a <hi>zeal</hi> and desire to <hi>appease</hi> that <hi>Iustice</hi> which requires that we be <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and suffer for our sins. Herein consists the disposition we speak of. If we would practise this disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is thus. First the <hi>Christian</hi> must accept of all <hi>adversities</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> which are or may be in the <hi>life</hi> of man, as a mark of the will of <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>effect</hi> of his <hi>Iustice</hi> upon him; he must them <hi>embrace,</hi> and bear them in this sense, and with a desire to please <hi>God,</hi> and submit to his <hi>divine Iustice,</hi> who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to manifest himself in these <hi>painfull</hi> and <hi>laborious</hi> wayes; he must regard them as <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> not considering whence they come, and who is the immediate cause thereof, but shutting his eyes to all <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> he must look up towards <hi>God,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them of his fatherly hands. If there happen any motion contrary to the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he must say with the <hi>penitent</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi> King, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right are thy Iudgements.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119.137.</note> Nor must he <hi>content</hi> himself with this; but passing farther, he must <hi>offer</hi> himself to <hi>God,</hi> to bear all his <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements</hi> after the manner that <hi>God wills,</hi> and as long as shall please him. And since the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:29616:198"/>
true <hi>Christian</hi> always <hi>distrusts</hi> his <hi>own strength,</hi> he must beg <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain them according to the <hi>intention</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> to make such use of them as he requires. For as it suffices not a <hi>perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> to conform himself to the will of <hi>God,</hi> and to do what <hi>God</hi> wills, but he must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it <hi>after the manner that God wills,</hi> and according to the <hi>vocation</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> hath established him, so in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which is an <hi>estate more noble</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> it is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to suffer <hi>patiently,</hi> (for <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>generosity</hi> can produce this effect, and make the greatest rigours em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceable) but we must suffer <hi>Christianly,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner that God wills, according to his <hi>designes,</hi> conformable to the <hi>grace</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> receives of him, which ought to be seriously considered by those who are most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the wayes of <hi>grace,</hi> and who owe a great <hi>fidelity</hi> to God. And since to discern this is <hi>difficult,</hi> and that the <hi>soul</hi> may commit in it great <hi>impurities,</hi> and much <hi>infidelity,</hi> it suffices, to be exempted of the <hi>miscarriages</hi> which may happen, that he who seriously looks after <hi>Christian perfection,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to please God above all things, be carefull to <hi>preserve</hi> himself in an absolute <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation</hi> of himself to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God; in which estate if it be <hi>firmly setled,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29616:199"/>
there is nothing to be feared, but all these will prove easie, in regard that <hi>patience</hi> in <hi>suffering</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> ought to be <hi>proportionable</hi> to the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> wherein the <hi>soul</hi> is, and it must needs be of a great <hi>purity,</hi> when the <hi>grace</hi> is <hi>singular</hi> and <hi>transcendent.</hi>

               <p>TO <hi>suffer</hi> all things out of <hi>zeal</hi> to God's <hi>justice,</hi> is not onely a <hi>Disposition,</hi> but a <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>penitence,</hi> necessary to all, since all have <hi>sinned,</hi> and need the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as profitable to a <hi>Christian,</hi> as <hi>repentance</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. True <hi>penitence</hi> hath no <hi>end</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> no <hi>regard</hi> but to <hi>satisfie God.</hi> To <hi>repent,</hi> is to enter into a <hi>regard</hi> of our selves in <hi>zeal</hi> to God's <hi>justice,</hi> who will punish <hi>sin</hi> in us. We must take heed that the true <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance operate</hi> in us a <hi>resentment</hi> of the <hi>state</hi> whereto we are reduced by <hi>sin,</hi> a <hi>state</hi> which <hi>displeases</hi> God, and draws us from the <hi>amity, presence,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God, a <hi>state</hi> whereinto we put our selves through our own <hi>fault,</hi> to satisfie our own <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>passions.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> seeing her self so <hi>estranged</hi> from God, and being sensible of this <hi>misfortune,</hi> is
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29616:199"/>
                  <hi>grieved</hi> extremely, and enters into a <hi>desire</hi> to be reveng'd of her self, and to please <hi>God,</hi> whom she hath <hi>offended,</hi> she doth protest to <hi>love</hi> him above all things; for if she could not <hi>love</hi> him, she could not <hi>desire</hi> to please him. This <hi>love</hi> elevates her into an <hi>esteem,</hi> by this <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> she finds it easie to bear all <hi>pains, rigours,</hi> or <hi>difficulties</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; she overcomes them <hi>couragiously;</hi> she onely minds to please <hi>God,</hi> whom she hath <hi>offended</hi>; so that by this <hi>zeal</hi> to his <hi>justice,</hi> all things are easie to her; the <hi>contrarieties</hi> of this present <hi>life,</hi> and the unexpected <hi>rigours</hi> and <hi>disgrace</hi> are light. In brief, <hi>animated</hi> with this <hi>zeal,</hi> she willingly <hi>embraces</hi> all that may happen unto her, and receives it as a <hi>speciall favour.</hi> The reason is, because such a <hi>soul loves</hi> God, <hi>loving</hi> God, she <hi>esteems</hi> him; <hi>esteeming</hi> him, she will not <hi>displease</hi> him, and as much as she hath <hi>displeased</hi> him by her <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi> she desires to <hi>glorifie</hi> him; and this desire bears her to a <hi>zeal</hi> of Gods <hi>justice</hi>; and finally, this <hi>zeal animates</hi> her to <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> all things <hi>patiently,</hi> and to <hi>embrace</hi> them <hi>freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we learn, that the <hi>true spirit</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> consisteth not onely in <hi>sorrow</hi> for sins committed, and a <hi>hatred</hi> of all sins, but also it contains a desire to <hi>glorifie</hi> God; for we can no more enter into <hi>Paradise</hi> without

this, then without <hi>repentance</hi>; Herein they must have a <hi>care,</hi> who perform indeed some acts of <hi>mortification,</hi> and <hi>suffer</hi> many things, but with certain <hi>dissemblings,</hi> or out of some private <hi>considerations</hi> or <hi>concernments,</hi> and many times out of <hi>curiosity.</hi> Let them take heed they build not with <hi>straw</hi>; for true <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> hath no eyes but for God; no other <hi>regard</hi> but to <hi>content</hi> God, and to <hi>glorifie</hi> his <hi>divine justice.</hi> The more <hi>love</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> hath, the more <hi>ardent</hi> is her <hi>zeal,</hi> so that if she <hi>love</hi> much, she desires to sorrow much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves she hath never done enough, for true <hi>love</hi> is never satisfied. Such a <hi>soul esteemeth</hi> all <hi>pains</hi> sweet, <hi>injuries,</hi> truth, <hi>contempt,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and <hi>labours</hi> the <hi>enjoyments</hi> of her <hi>spirit.</hi> O how good it is to <hi>suffer</hi> thus, for who knows how to <hi>love,</hi> knows how to <hi>suffer,</hi> and <hi>transported</hi> with the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>sufferings,</hi> cryes out with the penitent <hi>King, Lord, prove me and try me,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To be throughly acquainted with true <hi>repentance,</hi> we must further consider the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of it; for if it be true, the <hi>effects</hi> of it shall be as certain, and will be <hi>great</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> True <hi>repentance, annihilates</hi> us, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys</hi> sin in us, and the <hi>fountains</hi> of sin; as also our <hi>evil inclinations</hi> and <hi>vicious habits</hi>; it roots out of our <hi>hearts</hi> all that divides us from <hi>God,</hi> all that <hi>displeaseth</hi> him; it <hi>converts</hi>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:29616:200"/>
us to <hi>God,</hi> it drawes us neer to him, it gives us <hi>God,</hi> and separates us from the <hi>creatures,</hi> and <hi>our selves.</hi> For the <hi>true penitent</hi> is <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> in all things, and <hi>dead</hi> to himself, of a death to sin, which giveth him <hi>life</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and makes him lead a new <hi>life,</hi> altered in himself and in his <hi>actions.</hi> This is the true meaning of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> where he saith, <hi>As you have yeilded your members servants to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.19</note> 
                  <hi>and to iniquity even so now yeild your members servants to righteousness, unto holiness.</hi> Which shews the great <hi>change</hi> and <hi>conversion</hi> which <hi>repentance</hi> must <hi>operate</hi> in us, seeing our <hi>members,</hi> which have been servants to sin, must now be onely servants to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and to serve <hi>God,</hi> after a manner which <hi>operates</hi> in us <hi>sanctification,</hi> and serves as an instrument to our <hi>glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, <hi>true repentance</hi> unites us to <hi>God,</hi> and puts us into a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> relation to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> He acquires a <hi>new right</hi> over us, when we <hi>participate</hi> of his <hi>mercies,</hi> and applies to us the <hi>merits</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> pardoning our sin. He acquires a <hi>new right</hi> over us, because he applies to us the <hi>price</hi> of his <hi>blood,</hi> by the <hi>merits</hi> of his <hi>death.</hi> He withdraws us from the <hi>empire</hi> of sin, whereto we had <hi>subjected</hi> and <hi>sold</hi> our selves; he delivers us from the <hi>captivity</hi> and <hi>slavery</hi> of <hi>vice,</hi> to put us into the <hi>liberty</hi> of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:29616:201"/>
his <hi>children,</hi> into the <hi>possession</hi> of his <hi>spirit;</hi> so that from the time that he delivered us from the <hi>tyranny</hi> of sin, we belong unto him, and are his <hi>children,</hi> his <hi>captives,</hi> his <hi>heritage;</hi> we are so many times his, as he pardons our sins, as many sins as he pardons, so many times he <hi>offers</hi> himself to his <hi>eternall Father,</hi> to pay the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>misdeeds,</hi> and offereth him the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> for the <hi>redemption</hi> of <hi>offences.</hi> Thus he <hi>purchaseth</hi> us anew as often as he <hi>pardoneth</hi> our <hi>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance,</hi> if it be <hi>true,</hi> gives the <hi>Son</hi> of God a new <hi>right</hi> in us, and draws us from the <hi>right</hi> we have of our selves, to put us into new <hi>propriety</hi> as to him, whence it follows, that the sins which <hi>separated</hi> us from <hi>God</hi> by our own <hi>default,</hi> serve by the <hi>bands</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> to unite us to <hi>God</hi> by the new <hi>right Iesus Christ</hi> hath to us, by the <hi>band</hi> of <hi>love</hi> which we have to him. <hi>Many sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her,</hi>

                  <hi>for she loved much, and he to whom less is pardoned loved less,</hi> saith <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> True <hi>repentance</hi> produceth <hi>two</hi> admirable <hi>effects, one</hi> in relation to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends an <hi>abnegation</hi> from the <hi>creature</hi> and our selves to be <hi>God's</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ's,</hi> to whom we must be the more <hi>united,</hi> the more he hath <hi>pardoned</hi> us. <hi>The Father is an effect of love,</hi> which issues from this <hi>union</hi> &amp; <hi>adherence.</hi>

He that is most <hi>united, loves</hi> most, and the more he <hi>loves,</hi> the faster he ties himself. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is an example hereof, who was no sooner <hi>converted,</hi> but she fastened her self to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to crucifie her self in his <hi>love,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> no longer then with him, and for him. If we will examine what hath been said, it will be easie to see, that many persons deceive themselves in this <hi>business</hi> of so great <hi>concernment,</hi> I mean, <hi>Repentance,</hi> who go so <hi>negligently,</hi> and <hi>indifferently</hi> to this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that being they are sensible neither of the <hi>effect</hi> nor <hi>advantage</hi> of it, and it is much to be feared, lest they find at the hour of <hi>death,</hi> rather the <hi>penitence</hi> of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious <hi>Iudas,</hi> of an impious <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of a sensuall <hi>Esau,</hi> then of a Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or a <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> However, if be, let him apprehend the menaces of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, <hi>If ye do not repent,</hi>

               <p>CHrist saith, we are all <hi>ingraffed in him,</hi> as the <hi>scien</hi> is in the <hi>Vine-stock,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 15.5.</note> we are <hi>bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayes;<note place="margin">Eph. 5 30.</note> for we are his <hi>body,</hi> we are in him, and with him. This <hi>truth</hi> alone shews how much we are <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>live holily</hi> and <hi>perfectly,</hi> to be <hi>regulated</hi> in our <hi>actions,</hi> in our <hi>exteriour, modest</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> being <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> our <hi>life</hi> must be an <hi>expression</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and as <hi>Iesus,</hi> being the <hi>Son</hi> of God, by <hi>nature</hi> is the Image of his <hi>Father</hi>; so a <hi>Christian</hi> being the <hi>child</hi> of God by <hi>grace</hi> must be the Image of the same, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> an Image so <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> as cannot be fully expressed: For on the one side the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> is a <hi>life</hi> hid from the eyes of man, <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>invisible,</hi> and therefore infinitely remov'd from the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> of the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> who are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,</hi> and, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>carnall and animal.</hi> On the other side, this <hi>life</hi> is a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> a <hi>divine life,</hi> a <hi>life</hi> of God in man, a <hi>life</hi> full of secrets, <hi>operated</hi> by God

in the depth of the <hi>soul.</hi> Our weak <hi>nature</hi> hath not termes proportionable to the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>divine</hi> things, and therefore all that we can say of the state of <hi>Christianity,</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and of the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Christian,</hi> doth but derogate from, and deface the value of this work which cannot appear in its <hi>lustre,</hi> but to their eyes who have the <hi>true light</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor can be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> or <hi>comprehended</hi> but by <hi>souls</hi> that are chosen of God. We must notwithstanding, draw the last <hi>lines</hi> of our <hi>Christian</hi> image, and lightly passing over what hath been said to <hi>sweeten</hi> that which appeares either <hi>too high</hi> or <hi>too harsh,</hi> that so we may <hi>benefit</hi> those who will see things in <hi>perspective</hi> and <hi>superficially,</hi> we must also fix our <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> upon <hi>Christian grace,</hi> which will make us appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>truth</hi> of what hath been <hi>proposed,</hi> and, if we can <hi>understand</hi> it, will cause us to <hi>admire</hi> the <hi>indulgence</hi> and <hi>communications</hi> of God, who out of the <hi>excess</hi> of his <hi>love,</hi> the more advanceth <hi>men</hi> and <hi>sinners,</hi> the more they were debased by the greatness of their <hi>ingratitude,</hi> that <hi>grace</hi> might superabound where sin had abounded, that <hi>love</hi> might tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over us. Let us then descend to the <hi>particularities</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and examine the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>grace</hi> which we receive and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29616:205"/>
us, is the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which flowes from his <hi>fulness,</hi> and communicates to our <hi>souls grace,</hi> which is not onely <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,</hi> but was made for <hi>Iesus,</hi> and is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>infinite dignity,</hi> whence we are called <hi>Christians.</hi> It hath all its <hi>being, dignity,</hi> and <hi>residence</hi> in <hi>Iesus,</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our <hi>nature,</hi> and in the rank of <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> things, in an order <hi>soveraign</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> worthy of the <hi>soveraignty</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and proportioned to his <hi>Filiation, order</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> very different from the originall <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> which was given to the first man. For though the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> were <hi>supernatural,</hi> yet was it an order very inferiour to <hi>Christian grace,</hi> being proportioned to his <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> in the state of <hi>innocency.</hi> All men as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> had been <hi>sanctified</hi> in the <hi>order,</hi> and according to the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and in the naturall uses thereof. But it is not so in <hi>Christian grace,</hi> for that is not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the <hi>nature</hi> of man, but above it, wholly in <hi>Iesus,</hi> wholly for him, it issues out of him, and, by an effect <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> to it, drawes us from our selves, to unite us to him, as <hi>members</hi> to the <hi>head,</hi> and being united, <hi>sanctifies</hi> us in Him, in such a manner as that we are no more in the <hi>quality</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> but as <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and by a
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29616:205"/>
                  <hi>grace</hi> proper to the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; of whose <hi>fulness</hi> we have all received.</p>
               <p>Whence we infer, that he who would be <hi>sanctified,</hi> and partake of <hi>Christian grace,</hi> must be united to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the <hi>branch</hi> to the <hi>Tree,</hi> the <hi>graft</hi> to the <hi>stock,</hi> the <hi>members</hi> to the <hi>head,</hi> and if <hi>united,</hi> must also be one with him, as the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>members</hi> make up but one <hi>body,</hi> and consequently by reason of that <hi>unity,</hi> must not onely partake of his <hi>grace,</hi> but also his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> in the same manner as we say, the <hi>members</hi> move not themselves nor <hi>live,</hi> but by the <hi>life</hi> of their <hi>head.</hi> This being considered, we see that to <hi>live Christianly,</hi> it is not enough to say that we must be in <hi>grace,</hi> but we must <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> for <hi>grace</hi> produceth this <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> for as much as by the same <hi>principle,</hi> whereby we are united to <hi>Iesus,</hi> as <hi>members</hi> to their <hi>head,</hi> we must <hi>live</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> and be guided by his <hi>spirit.</hi> And as it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Christian grace,</hi> to unite us to the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> so is it the effect of the same <hi>grace,</hi> to rule us by his <hi>spirit,</hi> and to make us <hi>live</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> wherein appeares how <hi>perfect</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> in <hi>grace</hi> should be, how <hi>exemplary</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> his <hi>actions</hi> must be, how <hi>regular</hi> his <hi>motions,</hi> and how <hi>pure</hi> his <hi>intentions,</hi> seeing it is a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> which unites us to the <hi>Son</hi> of God, which making us one with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:29616:206"/>
him, causes us to <hi>live</hi> in his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us enter further into the <hi>consideration</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and we shall see, that according to the <hi>Apostle, Grace</hi> is a <hi>participation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> These words contain the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and describe all that can be said of <hi>grace.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> implies, that we are <hi>accidentally</hi> what God is <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> and that which agrees with God, and is <hi>proper</hi> to him according to his <hi>divine nature</hi> is <hi>appropriated</hi> to us, and may be convenient for us, according to the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>grace:</hi> so that by <hi>grace</hi> we are elevated from our own <hi>baseness</hi> to the <hi>fellowship</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and we are put out of our selves, to receive a <hi>new being</hi> in God. Can any thing be said more <hi>admirable</hi> or <hi>great?</hi> If we reflect on this <hi>truth,</hi> we must needs confess, that to <hi>live</hi> according to <hi>Christian grace,</hi> and bear it's <hi>effects</hi> in our <hi>souls,</hi> we must go out of our selves, and be no more our own, nor in our selves. When we say, we must go out of our selves, we would <hi>intimate,</hi> that the <hi>Christian,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> like a <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> must <hi>regard</hi> nothing but God, <hi>mind</hi> no <hi>Interest</hi> but that of the <hi>glory</hi> of God, <hi>please</hi> none but God, have no <hi>desire,</hi> but to <hi>accomplish</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of God. In brief, he must <hi>renounce</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the <hi>love</hi> of all <hi>things</hi> to <hi>love</hi> none but God. To <hi>live</hi> so, as to go out of ones
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29616:206"/>
self, is in two words, all that we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the <hi>fourth Part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>Point</hi> may be thought <hi>hard,</hi> and <hi>too high,</hi> yet the practice thereof is <hi>necessary,</hi> according to those words of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God, He that will follow me, let him deny himself</hi>;<note place="margin">Luk. 9 23.</note> where we see how much a <hi>Christian</hi> is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> all, and to <hi>go out of himself</hi> after the manner we have <hi>declared,</hi> which will appear more <hi>cleer,</hi> if we consider the <hi>essence</hi> of the <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> for the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> is a <hi>love,</hi> says <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagite, extatick,</hi> that is to say, it <hi>raiseth</hi> us to a <hi>contempt</hi> of our selves, and all things, to <hi>unite</hi> us to God, who is <hi>essentially love</hi> and <hi>charity</hi>; so that by the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which is in the <hi>love</hi> of God, we are drawn from the <hi>love</hi> of our selves and the <hi>creature,</hi> to be onely God's, and not to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> our selves in any thing but in God.</p>
               <p>Thus, which way soever we consider <hi>Christianity,</hi> we find, that both <hi>love</hi> and <hi>Christian grace,</hi> causes us to go out of our selves, to <hi>unite</hi> us to God, and make us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his <hi>divine Nature.</hi>

            <p>FRom the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> last explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we learn the great <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Innocency</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> righteousness in <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>power</hi> over all things, it was <hi>permitted</hi> him to <hi>enjoy</hi> the whole <hi>world,</hi> and to <hi>rejoyce</hi> therein. Original <hi>righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>grace</hi> of the first man, was in that, and in the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full use</hi> of all things, but <hi>Christian grace</hi> is quite contrary; for God wills not any more that man <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>content</hi> himself in any thing but in him, that he <hi>live</hi> not but for him; that he alone be his <hi>possession</hi> and <hi>heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi> Besides, the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> was in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,</hi> in the <hi>possession,</hi> in the <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> that he might <hi>lawfully</hi> take in the <hi>creatures</hi> that were <hi>subjected</hi> to him, during the time that he remained in <hi>obedience</hi> to God. But the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> is wholly <hi>opposite,</hi> it consists altogether in <hi>privations,</hi> in <hi>humiliations,</hi> in <hi>dejections,</hi> and in summ, it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests</hi> man of all <hi>power,</hi> even that which he hath of himself, that he may be wholly <hi>Iesus Christ's,</hi> that <hi>separating</hi> himself from the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and from himself, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> might be
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:29616:207"/>
his <hi>All,</hi> and his <hi>Fulness,</hi> that by <hi>Christian grace</hi> he might enter into <hi>society</hi> with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and by him, with his <hi>Father,</hi> according to what the beloved <hi>Apostle</hi> promised us, when he said,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Thus all the <hi>fruition, satisfaction, pleasure,</hi> and <hi>exaltation</hi> that man took in the <hi>creature</hi> by originall <hi>righteousness</hi> he takes in God, making a happy <hi>change</hi> and <hi>possessing</hi> the <hi>Creator</hi> for the <hi>creature,</hi> wherein is verified the word of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <hi>where sin did abound, grace did superabound.</hi> By <hi>Christian grace,</hi> we are drawn from the <hi>creature,</hi> and from our selves, to be in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>possess</hi> God, and to take no <hi>content</hi> or <hi>satisfaction,</hi> but in God. The <hi>Christian</hi> by this <hi>grace,</hi> takes all in God, lives not but for God, and lives the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of God. In this sense, the <hi>Apostle,</hi> fill'd with this <hi>grace,</hi> saith, <hi>I live, but it is no more I that live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>but Iesus Christ who liveth in me.</hi> We should all say the same, for <hi>Christian grace</hi> makes us to <hi>live</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> which is so <hi>true,</hi> that we see the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> hath for it's sole <hi>conservation</hi> and <hi>food,</hi> the very <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> for, if according to the ordinary <hi>maximes</hi> of things <hi>naturall,</hi> we say that every thing draws it's <hi>nutriment,</hi> from whence it draws its <hi>being,</hi> since the <hi>food</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> is no

If we further consider the same <hi>grace,</hi> we shall discover a new secret in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life</hi>; for having said that <hi>grace</hi> makes us <hi>live</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> we ought to know what his <hi>life</hi> is. The <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> is <hi>divinely-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> and <hi>humanely-divine;</hi> He is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> and therefore <hi>lives</hi> a <hi>life divine,</hi> and a <hi>life humane.</hi> As God he <hi>lives</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of God in the bosom of his <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Glory, Power</hi> and <hi>Majesty;</hi> as man he <hi>lives</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> in <hi>lowness, humiliation,</hi> in <hi>impotence,</hi> in <hi>sufferings.</hi> So that at the same time, he is living in the bosom of his <hi>Father,</hi> and dying on the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Crosse.</hi> There he <hi>raigns</hi> and <hi>governs,</hi> and <hi>judges</hi> all the <hi>World</hi>; here he is <hi>accused, condemned,</hi> and <hi>crucified.</hi> At the same instant, he is in the <hi>exaltation</hi> and <hi>greatness</hi> of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and in the <hi>lowness</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi> of our <hi>humanity.</hi> Such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ought the <hi>Christian</hi> life to be; on the one side it is great, seeing <hi>grace</hi> makes us the <hi>Children</hi> of God, <hi>elevates</hi> and <hi>unites</hi> us to God, makes us partakers of the <hi>proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi> of God, in a word, <hi>deifies</hi>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:29616:208"/>
us, and makes us as <hi>little</hi> gods. On the other side, the same <hi>life</hi> is <hi>obscured, dejected,</hi> wholly in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>privation;</hi> for <hi>grace</hi> cannot <hi>reign</hi> in the <hi>soul</hi> without <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> therein <hi>annihilation, death</hi> and <hi>humility.</hi> Moreover, the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> is <hi>exposed</hi> to <hi>temptations, derided</hi> by men, <hi>condemned</hi> by the <hi>world,</hi> and in the greatest <hi>cherishing</hi> of God, it is <hi>agitated</hi> by the <hi>cross</hi> of <hi>love.</hi> God <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> it is granted, but it is in <hi>annihilation,</hi> he <hi>upholds</hi> her, but it is in <hi>confounding</hi> her, he <hi>unites</hi> her to him, but it is in <hi>separating</hi> her; and the <hi>love</hi> it self which she <hi>enjoys, unites</hi> her to God; she remains <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi> from God, as long as she remains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>earth, While we are in the body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the Lord</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.6.</note> so is she at once <hi>united</hi> and <hi>separated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>conduct</hi> of God over his <hi>Church,</hi> nay, if we reflect upon the highest <hi>works,</hi> we shall find, he puts not the <hi>ornament</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>foundation</hi> of her <hi>estate,</hi> but in <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; his <hi>grace,</hi> his <hi>gifts,</hi> his <hi>spirit,</hi> and his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> we are but in <hi>humiliation,</hi> when he established the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are <hi>conduit pipes</hi> whereby he conveighs his <hi>graces</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> and into our <hi>souls.</hi> He hath chosen <hi>bread, water,</hi> and such things as are <hi>mean, little,</hi> or nothing <hi>esteemed</hi> among men. In the <hi>birth</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> he took the <hi>cross</hi> for
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:29616:209"/>
the <hi>throne</hi> of his <hi>Empire,</hi> a <hi>Calvary</hi> for his <hi>seat-royall</hi>; he <hi>rejected</hi> an <hi>estate</hi> by <hi>poverty, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and <hi>martyrdom,</hi> and at this day he does the same in the <hi>regency</hi> of his <hi>Church.</hi> It is true that this <hi>littleness</hi> is not now known, this <hi>martyrdom</hi> is within, all this <hi>holiness</hi> is hidden, it appears no more to the eyes of the <hi>world,</hi> as it did of old by the <hi>triumphs</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> who became <hi>victorious</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> in the <hi>effusion</hi> of their <hi>blood,</hi> and yet notwithwanding, she cannot be <hi>exempted</hi> from undergoing her <hi>humiliations,</hi> her <hi>heresies</hi> and <hi>persecutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the proceedings of God in the <hi>conduct</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> is likewise his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the <hi>sanctification</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> he <hi>leads</hi> them by the <hi>cross,</hi> he retires from them, he hides himself, he leaves them in <hi>privations,</hi> he <hi>humbles</hi> them, <hi>annihilates</hi> them, <hi>smites</hi> them, <hi>overthrows</hi> them. The <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Christian</hi> must resolve to fight with, and bear his <hi>sufferings</hi> in such manner as we have said, but <hi>sufferings</hi> that are hidden to men, are known to God, which do <hi>glorifie</hi> him only in the sight of <hi>Angels.</hi> Wherin is <hi>discovered</hi> how they are <hi>deceived</hi> who in their <hi>devotions</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> seek <hi>resentment, enjoyments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and would know and feel the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>elevations</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> I call it a <hi>deceit,</hi> for <hi>Christian grace</hi> consists, chiefly <hi>in privations,</hi> in <hi>lowness,</hi> in <hi>rigours,</hi> and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29616:209"/>
that is it they stand most in fear of and avoid. Now, as the life of <hi>Iesus</hi> begun in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> and ended on the <hi>cross,</hi> so a <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> who would <hi>live</hi> a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> must resolve to walk amongst <hi>thornes,</hi> to bear <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> and sustain <hi>desertions</hi>; for the <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>thornes</hi> are things proper to <hi>Christian grace,</hi> and to the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To abridge therefore the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and all that hath been proposed, let us say, that the <hi>Christian</hi> to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>walk worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> according to the <hi>vocation</hi> whereto he is called, must <hi>go out of himself</hi> to <hi>live</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> his <hi>centre</hi> must be the bosome of <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> a hidden <hi>martyrdom,</hi> and all his <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> must be <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>referred</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> of God; his <hi>intentions</hi> must look onely upon God, his <hi>desires</hi> must be onely to <hi>please</hi> God, his care onely to <hi>follow</hi> God, his <hi>contentment</hi> wholly in God. In brief, his <hi>thoughts,</hi> his <hi>designes,</hi> his <hi>works</hi> must bear the Image of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the foundation of his <hi>being</hi> must be onely of God, all to God, and all for God, that he may say with the Master of <hi>Christians,</hi>

               <p>The advice which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives his <hi>Disciple,</hi> we must here propose to our <hi>perfect Christian,</hi> having already spoken of <hi>vertues,</hi> the most profitable and necessary to the state of <hi>Christianity.</hi> There remains then no more to commend unto him, but a true and solid <hi>Christian Piety,</hi> for this <hi>Piety</hi> is the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi> or <hi>Mistriss</hi> of all other <hi>vertues.</hi> I mean the <hi>Christian vertues</hi> dispose us, assist us, and put us into a <hi>capacity</hi> agreeable to God, and to honour him, they are necessary for us to make us <hi>worthy</hi> of God, they shew us the <hi>way</hi> to God, but <hi>Piety</hi> leads us to <hi>God,</hi> and makes use of all <hi>vertues</hi> to <hi>conduct</hi> us thither, and having no <hi>object</hi> but God, teaches us the worship and honour that we must render to him, and like a good <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss,</hi> puts us into a <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> practise of <hi>true vertues,</hi> and entertains us in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of <hi>actions</hi> that <hi>honour</hi> God, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him: In brief, she <hi>enables</hi> us to <hi>pay</hi> God what we <hi>owe</hi> him.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Piety</hi> is the first use, and exercise of a <hi>soul</hi>; as the first <hi>motion,</hi> the first <hi>instinct,</hi> the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29616:211"/>
first <hi>light</hi> we have from <hi>nature</hi> to know <hi>God,</hi> so the first exercise she inspires us with, is to <hi>honour</hi> the same God, to render him that <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>service</hi> which the <hi>Creature</hi> owes its <hi>Creator.</hi> This <hi>Piety</hi> teaches, to this she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites us, this she produces in us: Whence we may apprehend, how necessary it is to know wherein this <hi>true piety</hi> consisteth, and to <hi>establish</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> therein. For above all that we have said already, which is very <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,</hi> it is evident, that this <hi>true piety</hi> is one of the principall <hi>foundations</hi> whereby <hi>Christian perfection</hi> is supported. In the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of men all <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> of their <hi>life,</hi> are ruled according to <hi>piety,</hi> and as we commonly say, according to the <hi>devotion</hi> they have. If then their <hi>piety</hi> be not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a solid foundation, the rest of the <hi>Christian life</hi> will be <hi>unconstant,</hi> and its exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses very <hi>uncertain, superficiall,</hi> and perhaps, wholly <hi>unprofitable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim 3.5</note> as we see in the <hi>devotions</hi> of many which is onely in the <hi>exteriour,</hi> who as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>having the form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, despise the power thereof.</hi> In such <hi>souls</hi> we see nothing solid, nothing but <hi>inconstancy</hi> in their <hi>lives, imperfection</hi> in their <hi>actions, disquiet, disturbance,</hi> and <hi>adherence</hi> to severall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their <hi>spirits,</hi> a small blast of <hi>adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> overturns them. If we consider all their <hi>life,</hi> it is nothing but an appearance and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:29616:211"/>
of <hi>piety,</hi> counterfeit Pearls, that make a fair glittering shew, but are fully onely of <hi>wind.</hi> Some fall into this evill <hi>by ignorance,</hi> others <hi>by default,</hi> it is our duty to direct <hi>both</hi> into the <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It concerns us therefore, to <hi>examine</hi> wherein <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>true Christian devotion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. Severall persons speak of it severally, every one adds to it, and appropriates it to his own <hi>inclinations, humour,</hi> and <hi>particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> But according to <hi>Catholick truth,</hi> the foundation of <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>true Christian pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> consisteth in the <hi>soul's</hi> being <hi>Iesus Christ's,</hi> and belonging to him, by a relation of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>charity. True piety</hi> consisteth in the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, esteem, adherence,</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> to <hi>Iesus Chrst,</hi> from which <hi>esteem, adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>subjection,</hi> all our <hi>exercises, actions</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> must proceed as <hi>heat</hi> from the <hi>fire,</hi> the <hi>effect</hi> from the <hi>cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This description of <hi>Piety</hi> may seem new, but it will appear manifest, if we weigh with patience the <hi>deduction</hi> thereof, and consider that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is our <hi>Saviour,</hi> our <hi>Mediator,</hi> by whom we have <hi>access</hi> to God, by whom we <hi>honour</hi> God, render our <hi>duties</hi> to him, and have a relation to the most <hi>high</hi> and most <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable Trinity,</hi> and refer our <hi>life actions,</hi> and our <hi>selves</hi> thereto. Herein <hi>consisteth</hi> true <hi>piety,</hi> for by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> we are acceptable to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:29616:212"/>
him, by him God, who is all sufficient in himself, vouchsafes to accept our <hi>wills,</hi> to <hi>sanctifie</hi> our <hi>actions,</hi> and recompense our <hi>good works.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth this, when he sayes that <hi>Iesus Christ is all our glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sess. 14. cap. 8.</note> It is by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and in him that we <hi>live,</hi> in him we <hi>merit,</hi> and satisfie by <hi>fruits</hi> worthy <hi>repentance,</hi> it is in him that they are <hi>meritorious,</hi> it is he that offers them to his <hi>Father</hi> (consider these words) and his <hi>Father accepts</hi> them, and they are <hi>acceptable</hi> to him for his sake. What more clear or more to our <hi>purpose?</hi> Hence we conclude, that <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>Christian pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> cannot be in a <hi>soul,</hi> if that <hi>soul</hi> be not <hi>Iesus Christ's,</hi> if it adhere not to him, and be <hi>subject</hi> to his <hi>spirit.</hi> For if we <hi>live</hi> not, if we <hi>merit</hi> not, nor can <hi>satisfie</hi> God but by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> it necessarily follows, we cannot <hi>live,</hi> if we are not <hi>Iesus Christs.

                  <hi>who hath not the Sonne hath not life,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, he hath <hi>nothing,</hi> and consequently, he hath no <hi>capacity</hi> to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>serve</hi> God, wherein consisteth <hi>true piety.</hi> Whence we may conclude that to <hi>acquire</hi> true <hi>devotion,</hi> we must begin with this <hi>esteem</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and by an <hi>adherence</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> to his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us more particularly <hi>explain</hi> wherein this <hi>true piety consists.</hi> To know it, we must not stop at <hi>exteriour things,</hi> or at <hi>actions</hi> which
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29616:212"/>
have nothing but <hi>appearance,</hi> but we must enter into the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> and regard true <hi>devotion</hi> onely in the centre of the <hi>heart</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The proper <hi>office</hi> and principall <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>true piety,</hi> is to cause us to regard God, to <hi>induce</hi> us to render to God what we owe him. It is necessary that we enter into the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, not by <hi>speculation</hi> or sublime <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> but by the light of <hi>Faith.</hi> This <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> leads us to esteem God, by this esteem we enter into a <hi>propriety</hi> and a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute subjection</hi> to his <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> all which is necessary to <hi>true devotion,</hi> for as much as we cannot render to God the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, love,</hi> and <hi>service</hi> we owe him, but in as much as we <hi>esteem</hi> him, and are <hi>subject</hi> to him. Seeing then <hi>Piety</hi> consisteth in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to God the <hi>honour, love,</hi> and <hi>service</hi> we owe him, and that we cannot otherwise <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> or <hi>serve</hi> him then as we esteem him, and depend of him and his <hi>divine will;</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that to be <hi>truly devout,</hi> we must act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>truths</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and follow this supernaturall <hi>light,</hi> we must conceive a great <hi>esteem</hi> of God, and live in great <hi>subjection</hi> to his <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>divine conduct,</hi> and so to <hi>live,</hi> is to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>true spirit</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> and to be <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all, we must proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Christian</hi> being in the bottom of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29616:213"/>
his <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> disposed after the manner we mention, feels a <hi>spirituall vivacity,</hi> an <hi>easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>promptitude</hi> which drives him to the <hi>practise</hi> of all <hi>vertues,</hi> and incites him to shew outwardly, in all sorts of <hi>actions,</hi> the <hi>worship, reverence,</hi> and <hi>love interiour,</hi> which he beares his God. This <hi>motion</hi> is so <hi>powerfull,</hi> this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity</hi> so <hi>efficacious,</hi> that he cannot but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <hi>express</hi> what he carries in the centre of his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> as fire that cannot be <hi>hid,</hi> but will break forth in flames. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>true piety</hi> cannot be concealed, but will appear by its <hi>effects,</hi> by the <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and by severall <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>occasion</hi> and <hi>time</hi> permits. We must observe that these <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> are the more <hi>pure sincere</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> the more the <hi>soul</hi> esteems God; her <hi>vertues</hi> are the more <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> the more she is <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>soveraignty</hi> of God, and <hi>submits</hi> her self to his <hi>divine will,</hi> as much as she encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> of her <hi>God,</hi> and establishes her self in this <hi>submission</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> to the will of <hi>God,</hi> so much doth she receive <hi>capacity, motion,</hi> and <hi>facility</hi> to all sorts of <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> and the <hi>practise</hi> of all <hi>vertues.</hi> The more this <hi>inward estate</hi> is <hi>augmented</hi> and <hi>perfected</hi> in her, the more her inward and outward <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>pure, holy,</hi> and <hi>perfect, not that she believes Devotion to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29616:213"/>

               <p>To summe what hath been said, we see that in <hi>true piety</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> things to be considered, <hi>one</hi> the <hi>interiour</hi> and bottom of the <hi>soul,</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> the <hi>exteriour,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in its <hi>actions.</hi> The <hi>interiour</hi> we look upon as the principalll <hi>root</hi> and <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>true piety;</hi> the <hi>exteriour</hi> is but as the <hi>blossome</hi> and <hi>fruit;</hi> as the <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to men, are but the mark of <hi>piety,</hi> and makes shew of it, but <hi>true piety</hi> consisteth in the <hi>interiour,</hi> as we have said.

delude the <hi>judgements</hi> of men, who see but the <hi>outside,</hi> and perhaps, before the eyes of that <hi>divine spirit</hi> which <hi>penetrates</hi> the <hi>centre</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> they are neither <hi>devout,</hi> nor <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> to him, for all their great <hi>performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>; unless these <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>outwardly</hi> proceed from the very <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,</hi> from a good <hi>foundation,</hi> from an <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> such as we have <hi>described.</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> who would be <hi>devout,</hi> to acquire a <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>Christian piety,</hi> must before all things bear an <hi>esteem</hi> of God; and if he truly <hi>esteem</hi> God, he will make <hi>account</hi> of all that is of God, he will <hi>honour</hi> all that is in the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and in any <hi>condition</hi> or <hi>estate</hi> will accept all the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>providence</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of God, he will <hi>resigne</hi> himself to his <hi>divine will,</hi> and above all, <hi>endeavour</hi> to enter into an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble relation</hi> to God, and having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>interiour,</hi> he easily practises <hi>vertue,</hi> and feels a <hi>promptitude</hi> to embrace all sorts of <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>devotion.</hi> By this we know <hi>true piety.</hi>

                  <hi>NO man cometh to the Father,</hi> saith <hi>Iesus Christ, but by me</hi>; to shew us that no man hath <hi>access</hi> to God,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.6.</note> but by his <hi>intterces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> By these words, he shews us the <hi>need</hi> we have of him, and the <hi>impotence</hi> wherein we all are. The <hi>impotence</hi> appears, in that we can do nothing <hi>without</hi> him, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God but <hi>by him;</hi> For <hi>sin</hi> hath not onely <hi>separated</hi> us from God, but also taken from us the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to return to God, and in <hi>effect,</hi> we would never have <hi>access</hi> to his <hi>Majesty</hi> justly provoked by our <hi>sins,</hi> if the <hi>Son</hi> of God by his <hi>divine mercy</hi> did not <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>bring</hi> us, to receive <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> The eternall <hi>Father</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us not, <hi>accepts</hi> not of our <hi>actions,</hi> is not <hi>pleased</hi> with our <hi>devotions</hi> and <hi>homage,</hi> otherwise then by his <hi>Son,</hi> in him, and by him, God <hi>triumphs</hi> over us.

Hence we must
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:29616:215"/>
confess, that the <hi>Christian</hi> who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>true vertue,</hi> and desireth to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>perfection</hi> of his <hi>estate,</hi> as he is <hi>obliged,</hi> must necessarily be <hi>Iesus Christ's.</hi> He must <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> to him, <hi>appertain</hi> to him, be <hi>subjected</hi> to his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> and much more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, if he would have <hi>true devotion</hi>; For seeing <hi>true piety</hi> consisteth principally in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's, and rendring to his most <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>soveraign Majesty,</hi> the <hi>worship, honour,</hi> and <hi>service</hi> due to him, and that otherwise we are <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>uncapable</hi> to do all that, without <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by whom, as we have said, we are God's, without whom we can neither <hi>honour God,</hi> nor be <hi>acceptable</hi> to him; It follows, that the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>true piety</hi> consisteth in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, in the <hi>adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>relation</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and in the <hi>submission</hi> of our <hi>being</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to the <hi>conduct</hi> of his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi>; for by that <hi>adhering</hi> to him, and being <hi>subjected</hi> to him, we are <hi>pleasing</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and receive in him, and by him the <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>honouring</hi> and <hi>serving</hi> God, which is the proper <hi>effect,</hi> and chief <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>truth</hi> would need no <hi>proof,</hi> but that few persons think thereof, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ignorant of it, therefore it seems to be to purpose, to speak thereof more at large in the <hi>Principles of Christianity.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

out going any further, let us <hi>consider,</hi> that to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> we must <hi>put off the old man, with his deeds,</hi>

                  <hi>and put on the new man, Iesus Christ</hi>; it is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostle</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we must found our <hi>Discourse.</hi> If to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> we must <hi>crucify and put off the old man,</hi> to <hi>put on the new,</hi> with much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to be a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>devout Christian</hi> we must <hi>crucify and put off the first,</hi> to invest us with the <hi>second.</hi> When we say that we must be <hi>clothed</hi> with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> it is to shew we must be <hi>united</hi> to him, <hi>adhere</hi> to him, and as a <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adheres</hi> to the body, and is <hi>united</hi> to it; so must we be <hi>Iesus Christ's,</hi> but much more <hi>perfectly</hi> then this <hi>comparison</hi> expresses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> will easily convince us of this <hi>truth,</hi> if we doubt of it; for <hi>faith</hi> teaches us, that it belongs to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to give us <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> to <hi>put off the old man,</hi> that is, to draw us from our <hi>imperfections,</hi> to deliver us from our <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>annihilate</hi> our <hi>evil inclinations.</hi> It is the same that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> invests us with the <hi>new,</hi> gives us his <hi>spirit, grace</hi> and <hi>vertue;</hi> for and according to Saint <hi>Paul, Iesus Christ hath been to us wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteousness,</hi>

                  <hi>sanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi>; In a word, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is <hi>all in all</hi> to us. Now, that the <hi>Son</hi> of God may <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> in us all that we have said, it is necessary that we be <hi>united</hi> to him, <hi>adhere</hi> to him, and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:29616:216"/>
                  <hi>be subjected</hi> to his designes, his will and <hi>divine operations.</hi> Who can deny so manifest a <hi>truth?</hi> If <hi>Iesus</hi> annihilate our evill <hi>inclinations,</hi> and <hi>root</hi> sin out of our hearts, ought not we to be <hi>subject</hi> to his conduct and spirit, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his <hi>operations</hi> of mercy? If we parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Commandements,</hi> is it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary we should be united to him? And how should we be united to him, but by a true <hi>relation</hi> and faithful <hi>adherence</hi> to him? This <hi>deduction</hi> is easie, and clearly shewes how true it is that the <hi>foundation</hi> of true <hi>piety</hi> consisteth in <hi>unity,</hi> and in the <hi>adherence</hi> and dependance of the <hi>soul</hi> on <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; it is acknowledg'd by all that <hi>devotion</hi> cannot be true, if we be not exempted from our <hi>vices</hi> and <hi>imperfections,</hi> and filled with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and assisted with his <hi>grace,</hi> to make us worthy to honour and serve <hi>God.</hi> We cannot perceive in that devotion, nor practise the exercises thereof, if the same <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> be not operating in us the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> according to his <hi>will.</hi>

                  <hi>Piety</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> requires not so much <hi>exteriour exercises,</hi> as <hi>interiour</hi> and permanent <hi>estate</hi> doth in our <hi>souls,</hi> nor demands it any <hi>novelty</hi> of <hi>affection,</hi> but a <hi>newness</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> a new <hi>disposition,</hi> enclining our <hi>souls</hi> to employ themselves in the <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>regard</hi> him, to <hi>love</hi> him, to <hi>honour</hi> him as the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>life, actions,</hi> and <hi>devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> It requires that the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> should be <hi>devout,</hi> those of the <hi>ordinary Christians vertuous,</hi> those of a <hi>private person,</hi> familiar in this <hi>object,</hi> without changing his <hi>spirit,</hi> but directing his <hi>intentions</hi> and <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the <hi>pure regard</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God. For example, let us do all that we do by the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; if we <hi>suffer,</hi> let it be to imitate and render <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to his <hi>sufferings;</hi> what ever happens to us, let us receive it by a dependance on, and submission to his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>conduct.</hi> If we will insist upon any <hi>good thoughts,</hi> let it be of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>consider</hi> his <hi>greatness,</hi> the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>

of his <hi>life,</hi> his <hi>vertues,</hi> his <hi>benefits,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> he hath over us. By these <hi>sweet entertainments,</hi> by these <hi>regards of honour and love,</hi> the <hi>perfect Christian</hi> advances himself, is <hi>confirm'd</hi> in the <hi>piety</hi> we speak of. To know what this <hi>piety</hi> is, and how we must <hi>apply</hi> our selves thereto, let us <hi>consider,</hi> that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>principle,</hi> the <hi>centre,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian souls</hi>; for as <hi>faith</hi> teaches us, he is the <hi>cause</hi> of all the <hi>good</hi> that is in us, the <hi>spring</hi> of all the <hi>graces</hi> we <hi>possess, Author</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> which we <hi>live</hi> in <hi>Christianity,</hi> and being the <hi>principle,</hi> he is also consequently the <hi>end</hi> thereof.

                  <hi>You are not your own</hi>; and again, <hi>you have no power on your selves.</hi> This <hi>power obliges</hi> us to refer our selves wholly to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the first <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> to be done in <hi>Christian piety, being,</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> we have no <hi>right</hi> to our selves, but are wholly <hi>Christ's,</hi> and, having conceived in the depth of our <hi>souls</hi> this <hi>belief,</hi> to have a <hi>vigilant care,</hi> that in our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> we draw not our selves from the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God to make use of our <hi>selves</hi> and the <hi>creatures</hi> to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:29616:221"/>
our own <hi>content</hi> and <hi>particular interests.</hi> For according to the <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> we have no <hi>right</hi> to <hi>appropriate</hi> any thing to our <hi>selves.</hi> This <hi>belief</hi> is the ground of <hi>true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, saying,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> 
                  <hi>The Son of God died, that those that live might live no longer to themselves, but to him who died for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this <hi>truth,</hi> we ought often to reflect. For as the <hi>foundation</hi> of it consisteth in a true <hi>dependance</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his <hi>soveraign power</hi> over us; so the <hi>principall care</hi> of him who seeks <hi>true piety,</hi> must be to continue in this <hi>dependance,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> with such <hi>fidelity,</hi> that he <hi>appropriate</hi> nothing to himself, either as to his <hi>life</hi> or <hi>actions,</hi> or yet of the <hi>creatures,</hi> and assuredly, he must make great account of this <hi>care</hi> and <hi>fidelity.</hi> But whereto serves it? To bear in his <hi>heart</hi> a sensible <hi>desire</hi> to belong to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and every day to renew his <hi>resolutions</hi> and <hi>good purposes.</hi> What doth it profit our <hi>soul,</hi> to have the <hi>knowledge</hi> of so high a <hi>truth,</hi> if in the <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>humane life</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> we withdraw our selves from this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> on the <hi>Son</hi> of God, to apply us to our selves, and seek in our own business and exercises our <hi>content</hi> and <hi>satisfaction.</hi> This were, by our own <hi>actions</hi> to belie the <hi>resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> to profess <hi>piety,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                  <hi>impiety,</hi> to bear a double <hi>heart,</hi> to have <hi>vertue</hi> only in the <hi>mouth.</hi> For if we are truly <hi>devout,</hi> we can not but be <hi>Iesus Christ's,</hi> and if we are his, our <hi>principall care</hi> will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be to <hi>continue</hi> our <hi>dependance</hi> on him, not onely in that which concerns our <hi>condition,</hi> but in all the <hi>dispositions, intentions, actions,</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same <hi>Principle operates</hi> in our <hi>souls</hi> a <hi>second effect</hi> of <hi>piety</hi> in that our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> belonging properly to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as their <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> ought accordingly to be <hi>submitted</hi> to his <hi>divine conduct,</hi> to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after what manner he <hi>pleases,</hi> according to the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>spirit,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of his <hi>loving communications.</hi> It is but reason that all good <hi>depend</hi> on <hi>him</hi> from whom it <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,</hi> and that we be <hi>ruled,</hi> not according to our <hi>own wills,</hi> which are blind, and <hi>transported</hi> with <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>self-love,</hi> but according to the <hi>intentions</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>cause,</hi> and ought necessarily to be the <hi>rule</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus the second <hi>interiour estate</hi> whereto the <hi>Christian,</hi> who seeks <hi>true piety</hi> must <hi>arrive,</hi> is a <hi>Resignation</hi> of himself, to the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that being so <hi>subjected,</hi> he may <hi>perform</hi> all his <hi>actions</hi> in a <hi>pure regard</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>divine intentions.</hi> This <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,</hi>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:29616:222"/>
if true, makes us bear with <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>inward peace,</hi> all <hi>estates</hi> we may possibly <hi>arrive</hi> to; it gives us <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>spirit, capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> to follow and embrace that only which is of <hi>God,</hi> and according to <hi>God;</hi> it puts us into a great <hi>fidelity</hi> to the motions of <hi>grace,</hi> in such manner, that according to the measure of our <hi>increase</hi> in this <hi>resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we advance in <hi>Christian piety,</hi> and live with greater <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> of <hi>soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed appears something <hi>difficult,</hi> and many believing it an <hi>estate</hi> onely for the most <hi>perfect,</hi> pass by it as a thing <hi>impossible</hi> for them.

to the <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> of the <hi>old man,</hi> it is but of little value, being at the most but <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>humane actions.</hi> But if it issue from <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> then is it truly <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Hence we say, the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>true piety</hi> consists in the <hi>subjection</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> to <hi>grace</hi> and the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; for if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> do not <hi>conduct</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> nor <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> her by his <hi>spirit,</hi> she can do nothing considerable.</p>

               <p>This the greatest part of Christians think not of; as being, by reason of their <hi>impiety,</hi> ignorant of their <hi>benefactor,</hi> as the Ancients were through their <hi>Idolatry</hi> of their <hi>Creator.</hi> It is a strange <hi>ingratitude,</hi> that man should be so <hi>blind</hi> in these dayes, as not know his <hi>Iesus,</hi> and passing his life away carelesly, neglect to acknowledge him in his <hi>greatness,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him in his <hi>works,</hi> and to honour him in his <hi>humane divine life.</hi> Our business then must be to reform this <hi>ignorance,</hi> and therefore we will propose the <hi>principall rights</hi> which he
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:29616:225"/>
hath to us, that we may learn with what <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> we ought to follow and serve him, and that those souls who neglect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise this <hi>piety,</hi> may re-enter into themselves, and endeavour from henceforth, to render to Jesus Christ the <hi>honour, love</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> whereto they are by so many just <hi>relations</hi> obliged.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>right</hi> that Jesus Christ hath to man, is derived from his <hi>Quality</hi> of being <hi>God-man,</hi> for such is the Sonne of God, not onely in regard of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>humanity.</hi> In this quality, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ by a power of <hi>excellency,</hi> ought to rule and command all that is and shall be created, a <hi>power</hi> that the eternal Father gave him at the first minute of his <hi>Incarnation</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, by this Mystery, the Son changing his <hi>condition</hi> for the <hi>glory of his Father,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing himself to honour him, the Father also will needs honour him, constituting him from thenceforward, the <hi>principle of life, grace and glory,</hi> proclaiming him <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of the universe,</hi> and replenishing his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature with all the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and all the <hi>states</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> possibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to him as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> that as the <hi>Sonne honoured</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> in debasing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so did the <hi>Father honour the Sonne,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting him. For this cause he makes him his
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:29616:225"/>
equall in <hi>power, greatness</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> and invests him from this first moment for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, with all the power that he hath over his <hi>creatures.</hi> This the beloved Apostle teaches,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.35.</note> when he saith, <hi>The Father hath given him all things into his hand:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to write the greatness of <hi>Iesus,</hi> saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, speaking of his mission, That the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father appointed him Heire of all things,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> by whom also he made the World. Thus by this first <hi>Right,</hi> and by the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> Jesus hath the same <hi>power</hi> over souls, that the <hi>Creator</hi> hath over his <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and in relation to this <hi>power,</hi> we give him all that we owe to God, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, acknowledge in this <hi>Mystery,</hi> Jesus to have a double power over us as <hi>God</hi> and man. This consideration obliges us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and serve him, acknowledging this <hi>power</hi> must doubly subject us to his <hi>conduct,</hi> and <hi>divine will.</hi> Heaven and Earth pay this <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> to this <hi>Iesus God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Let us hear with a resentment of love, how St. <hi>Iohn</hi> describes the <hi>triumphs</hi> of our <hi>Iesus</hi>; he tells us that he heard the <hi>Angels</hi> crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, <hi>The Lamb who hath been slain, is worthy to receive power and riches, and wisdom and strength, and honour and glory, and blessing.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> and all the <hi>creatures</hi> of the Universe do the like, and present themselves before

hath bought us with his most <hi>ineffably preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood.</hi> But the better to understand this <hi>sublime mystery,</hi> let us <hi>derive</hi> it from its very <hi>source.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are then to consider, that by the <hi>sin of our first parents,</hi> we should all have <hi>perished</hi> in him, as guilty with him, all <hi>nature</hi> should have been <hi>extinct</hi> by his <hi>sin</hi>; for, from his <hi>first offence</hi> he ought to bear the <hi>execution</hi> of the <hi>Decree</hi> pronounced against him by the mouth of <hi>God,</hi> in these words, <hi>In the day that thou shalt eat thereof, thou shalt surely die;</hi> And doubtless <hi>divine Iustice</hi> had <hi>annihilated</hi> him,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> and in him <hi>humane nature,</hi> and all <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> had <hi>perished</hi> with the <hi>Sinner,</hi> if the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father</hi> beholding his <hi>Son</hi> designed for the <hi>reparation</hi> of this <hi>offence</hi> had not <hi>repress'd</hi> the <hi>rigour</hi> of his <hi>Iustice.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> out of the <hi>love</hi> he bore his <hi>Son,</hi> suspended the <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this <hi>Decree,</hi> he saved the <hi>offender, mercy</hi> triumphed over <hi>justice,</hi> he granted this sinful man <hi>life,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> to <hi>live</hi> in; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>humane nature,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> it self, which for this <hi>sin</hi> should have been <hi>destroyed,</hi> were preserved, onely in consideration of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for his sake the <hi>eternall Father</hi> took compassion on us. From this first <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,</hi> is easily inferr'd, that we owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Son</hi> of God <hi>all that we are,</hi> and <hi>all that we have</hi>; and therefore we are as <hi>often his</hi> as
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29616:227"/>
there are <hi>moments in our life,</hi> and as often as we receive any <hi>benefit</hi> from this bountifull <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore all these <hi>rights</hi> which are innumerable, ought to be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>tyes</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> us <hi>indissolubly</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we dive further into the <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of these <hi>truths,</hi> we shall find, that by <hi>sin</hi> we belong to the <hi>Devil,</hi> we have granted him that <hi>right,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Creation</hi> gave us over the <hi>creatures</hi>; we have, as it were, by <hi>sin</hi> made over our selves to him. Thus by <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary offence,</hi> Man, who should have <hi>commanded</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> becomes a <hi>slave</hi> to the <hi>Devill,</hi> and sels himself to sin.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.14</note> in the name of all sinners. In this <hi>quality</hi> the Devill hath all manner of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> over us, and assuredly would exercise his <hi>malice</hi> against us, if the <hi>divine goodness</hi> did not restrain him. He would make us even now feel the same <hi>rigours</hi> which he exerciseth over the <hi>damned,</hi> and dispose of us at his pleasure, as he doth of <hi>souls</hi> eternally cursed of God, were it not that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by his <hi>death,</hi> hath forc'd us out of this <hi>captivity,</hi> and devested the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of all <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> over us. <hi>He hath blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us,</hi>

                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:29616:227"/>
makes us his <hi>Captives,</hi> acquiring by his <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> a new <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> over us, which he will use not with <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> but with <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> having nothing but sweetness and indulgence. <hi>He hath delivered us,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>from the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note> For the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> is all in <hi>love,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it self into <hi>dearness.</hi> What Christian seeing so much <hi>sweetness,</hi> will not resign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the <hi>excess</hi> of this <hi>goodness,</hi> to the <hi>power</hi> of this <hi>love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conceive more fully the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>rights</hi> to us by <hi>redemption,</hi> observe, that, by the <hi>conduct</hi> of God, and according to the <hi>merit</hi> of our <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi> so soon as man is in sin, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes himself from the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>end</hi> that God hath prefix'd and proposed to him, he is nothing but the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>divine justice,</hi> unworthy of any favour from Heaven. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> bandy against him, God is obliged onely to promote the punishment of sin by <hi>malediction, blasphemy, damnation</hi> and <hi>hell.</hi> If God stay the <hi>stroke</hi> of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> if he hath yet some <hi>reserve</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> for this miserable <hi>sinner,</hi> if he suffer him to live, and preserve him, out of an expectation of his <hi>penitence,</hi> that so he may escape hell, it is by
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:29616:228"/>
                  <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and onely for <hi>his sake.</hi> We must then acknowledge that a sinner owes to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> all the <hi>motions</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> all the <hi>happiness</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> all the <hi>good</hi> which may befall him in Heaven or Earth. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>obligations</hi> have we then! even as many as there are <hi>moments,</hi> as many as we have <hi>thoughts,</hi> as many as we have received <hi>benefits</hi> from time to time, so many <hi>rights</hi> hath <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to our <hi>souls,</hi> so many times do we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him. Who can number these <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi> Can there be any thing in nature able to break these <hi>bonds,</hi> and separate us from <hi>Iesus</hi>?</p>
               <p>Let us dive yet a little further into this <hi>consideration,</hi> by an examination of <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> let us see how by daily sins we separate our selves from God, and, shaking off the <hi>obedience</hi> we owe him, become slaves to sin. He <hi>that sins is a slave to sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 8.34.</note> saith <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so that the sinner by a deplorable <hi>blindness,</hi> withdrawing himself from the sweetness of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the Sonne of God, subjects himself to the <hi>power</hi> of sin, which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly exercise its <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> over him, if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by his mercy did not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press its <hi>malignity.</hi> For as sin ruling over the rebellious Angels, subjected them to its <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> and <hi>rigour,</hi> causing those <hi>Angels of light</hi> to be to all eternity <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>darkness</hi> and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:29616:228"/>
                  <hi>malediction</hi>; So the sinner, from the time he offended, should be abandoned to the same Tyranny, and left to the <hi>fury</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> which would precipitate him into all manner of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, abhomination</hi> and <hi>misery,</hi> had not <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> sustained the <hi>yoak</hi> of sin, and stayd the <hi>power</hi> of its <hi>malevolence.</hi> So that we are as many times <hi>Christ's,</hi> as he hath preserved us by his <hi>divine mercy</hi> from severall sins and <hi>abhominations.</hi> If on the other side we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider our <hi>actuall sins,</hi> we must acknowledge that they also serve to bind us to <hi>I. Christ,</hi> for <hi>as many sins as we commit,</hi> so <hi>many times</hi> do we deprive our <hi>souls</hi> of the <hi>favours</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> which we have received of God, by the only <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>Ie. Christ,</hi> and when <hi>Ie. Christ</hi> shewes mercy to us, or washes us with his <hi>blood,</hi> and withdrawes us from our <hi>sins,</hi> to restore us the <hi>graces</hi> which we have lost, at the same time he takes a new <hi>power,</hi> and acquires as many new <hi>rights</hi> over us, as he pardons <hi>sinnes</hi> in us. By this meanes the sins which God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons in us, oblige and bring us to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus on what side soever we look on our selves, we wholly belong to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and consequently are obliged to live in a totall <hi>dependance,</hi> and perpetuall <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>conduct, spirit,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if now to what we have said, should
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:29616:229"/>
be added the <hi>merits</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, we should find our selves infinitely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be <hi>united,</hi> and to appertain to the same <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For his <hi>merits</hi> being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in dignity acquire to him, <hi>infinite rights</hi> over us; nay, if we consider them <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</hi> we must needs nevertheless acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> acquires as many <hi>rights</hi> over us, as there are <hi>moments</hi> in his <hi>life,</hi> since in <hi>Iesus</hi> all is of <hi>infinite merit.</hi> We are <hi>his</hi> by his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> by his <hi>birth,</hi> by his <hi>teares,</hi> by his <hi>sufferings,</hi> by his <hi>Crosse,</hi> in a word, we are as many times <hi>his,</hi> as he lived <hi>moments</hi> upon earth, as often as he did <hi>actions</hi> in the world during his life here. But if we lift up our eyes to behold him in his <hi>glory,</hi> we shall see him incessantly, offering up himself for us to his <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.24.</note> 
                  <hi>he is entered into Heaven, now to appear in the presence of God for us,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, where he by continuall benefits shed upon us, forces our acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there are so many rights and obligations to appropriate and unite us to him, as there are moments in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>What remains then, but that we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by what meanes we may <hi>satisfie</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>obligations</hi> to the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree pronounced by him,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.48.</note>

                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:29616:229"/>
All our <hi>life</hi> then must be employ'd in <hi>true piety,</hi> a <hi>piety</hi> which shall establish us in a supreme <hi>honour,</hi> in a most powerful <hi>love,</hi> and an <hi>intire</hi> and <hi>absolute</hi> dependance on Jesus Christ. We must continually begg, that as the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> changed his <hi>condition,</hi> and became man to testifie his <hi>love</hi> to us, and to deliver us from the <hi>captivity</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> and put us into the state of <hi>salvation,</hi> so we may change our <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>disposition,</hi> to be happily converted into a pure regard of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and of <hi>imitation</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> who is all <hi>love,</hi> all <hi>goodnesse.</hi>

               <p>IF we make <hi>application</hi> of what hath been said, we shall find, that as the <hi>Son</hi> of God hath infinite <hi>rights</hi> to us, so we are infinitly his, we <hi>depend</hi> on him, we have infinite <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> to him, which the <hi>shortness</hi> of our <hi>dayes</hi> will not give us leave <hi>sufficiently</hi> to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi> nor the <hi>weakness</hi> of our <hi>spirits</hi> to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</hi> Yet speaking <hi>suitably</hi> to our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we may <hi>reduce</hi> them to <hi>two principles,</hi> the <hi>foundation</hi> and <hi>prop</hi> of all <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty interiour</hi> and <hi>exteriour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> is an <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of the <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> over all <hi>creatures,</hi> and over us in particular, confessing that he is our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Soveraign.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> use of <hi>piety</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi> is to <hi>acknowledge</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> his <hi>supreme authority</hi>; it is <hi>life</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> to know and to serve <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> desires that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> should <hi>know the love of Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.19</note> 
                  <hi>which passeth all knowledge, to the end that they might be filled with all the fulness of God,</hi> teaching how <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> this <hi>knowledge</hi> is. The other <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> is a <hi>continuation</hi> of the first, the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:29616:231"/>
                  <hi>Christian</hi> acknowledging the <hi>soveraignty</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> enters into a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>relation</hi> to, and a <hi>dependance</hi> on him, and <hi>adoring</hi> his <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,</hi> submits to his <hi>power,</hi> not out of <hi>constraint</hi> or <hi>necessity,</hi> as <hi>Rebells,</hi> but out of <hi>choice, love</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> which he renders to him as his <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Iesus.</hi> This <hi>dependance</hi> must not be <hi>indifferent,</hi> but the <hi>lowest</hi> and most <hi>submiss</hi> that is possible; so that a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in this <hi>state,</hi> looks upon himself only as a <hi>servant</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> in all things, only in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>humility.</hi> This <hi>subjection</hi> is an <hi>effect</hi> of our knowledge of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and that knowledge a fruit of the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and a <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>state</hi> of <hi>service,</hi> is proper and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the <hi>creature,</hi> in regard of <hi>God</hi>; the <hi>creature</hi> is essentially <hi>dependant</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Creator.</hi> It is an <hi>indispensable estate,</hi> the <hi>creature</hi> may as soon cease to <hi>be,</hi> as cease to <hi>depend</hi> on the <hi>Creator.</hi> It is a <hi>primitive estate</hi> in <hi>grace</hi> and essential to all <hi>Christians</hi> the first step of our <hi>entry</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; into <hi>faith,</hi> the first <hi>operation</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in our <hi>souls,</hi> is to become <hi>servants</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> This service is the first <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that we make to <hi>God</hi> by a solemn pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>profession</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Baptisme.</hi> There we <hi>devote</hi> our selves to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>belong</hi> to him, to <hi>depend</hi> on him, and at the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:29616:231"/>
same time we receive and aknowledge him as our <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> we <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> him as our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> we are <hi>united</hi> to him as to our <hi>Head.</hi> Thus this <hi>state</hi> of <hi>service</hi> brings <hi>grace</hi>; yea, singular <hi>grace,</hi> which is the first thing that God gives in his <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> a <hi>grace</hi> which he gives with a <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>impression</hi> of his <hi>power,</hi> so deeply <hi>imprinted</hi> in our <hi>souls,</hi> that nothing can <hi>deface</hi> it, not <hi>Hell</hi> it self. Whence we see, that at the same time that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> conceives us by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and receives us into his <hi>Church</hi> as his <hi>children,</hi> we enter into the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and vow our selves to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as such. So that by one and the same <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we are made <hi>children</hi> of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his <hi>servants,</hi> and consequently we are in the <hi>House</hi> of God, both as <hi>sons</hi> and <hi>servants,</hi> yet so, as that we are his <hi>children</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> his <hi>servants</hi> by <hi>nature.</hi> Now as we say, that the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>subjection</hi> is essentiall to the <hi>creature,</hi> and to the <hi>Christian,</hi> so the same <hi>state</hi> is essentiall to the <hi>piety</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and therefore they who would establish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>piety,</hi> must begin their <hi>establishment</hi> in this <hi>subjection</hi>; for we must bear a <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as we do of <hi>purchase</hi> and <hi>necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be convinced of this <hi>truth,</hi> we are to observe that this <hi>state</hi> of <hi>subjection</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:29616:232"/>
in taking <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>actions,</hi> we serve him, we contemplate him as our <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> we do all things by a <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>love, honour,</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> on him; So that this <hi>state</hi> of <hi>dependance</hi> and <hi>service</hi> is a generall <hi>Disposition</hi> wherein we perform all our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> By this <hi>Disposition</hi> they are truly <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> accomplished in the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>true piety</hi>; and though there appear nothing <hi>outwardly,</hi> either <hi>new</hi> or <hi>extraordinary</hi> in our <hi>life,</hi> yet by this <hi>disposition</hi> and <hi>state</hi> of <hi>service,</hi> we are more neerly <hi>Christ's,</hi> who looks on us as his own, <hi>raising</hi> and <hi>uniting</hi> us to himself by a reall <hi>dependance,</hi> wherein consists the true <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>piety.</hi> For by the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>service</hi> we <hi>acknowledge Christ</hi> our <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and our selves his <hi>vassals</hi>; we <hi>adore</hi> him as our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and confess our selves his <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> In this <hi>quality</hi> we <hi>adhere</hi> inviolably to all his <hi>will</hi>; In a word, we see that he is our <hi>Head,</hi> and we <hi>united</hi> to him as his <hi>members.</hi> In this <hi>union</hi> we <hi>live</hi> by his <hi>spirit,</hi> and follow his <hi>motions,</hi> in which three <hi>points</hi> consisteth <hi>solid piety,</hi> and the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> So that we are so much the more God's, and <hi>consequently</hi> the more <hi>perfect,</hi> by how much we are the more <hi>abased</hi> and <hi>devested</hi> of our selves, entirely <hi>depending,</hi> and faithfully <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> under the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of him who
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:29616:232"/>
makes himself ours, that we may be his, and hath <hi>purchased</hi> us to <hi>himself</hi> at an <hi>inestimable</hi> rate. For this cause, they who <hi>exercise</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves seriously in <hi>piety,</hi> begin at the same time to look upon the <hi>Son</hi> of God as the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of their <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>resign</hi> themselves up to him. Hence springs the daily <hi>practice</hi> of certain <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>interiour devotion,</hi> which is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> proposed to them that seek <hi>true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> recommended to them, because they are <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> drawing the <hi>soul</hi> from it self, to <hi>elevate</hi> and <hi>unite</hi> it to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> We shall further <hi>explain</hi> it in the ensuing <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we enter into that <hi>Discourse,</hi> we are to know, that we must not conceive these <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>interiour devotion,</hi> to be <hi>actions</hi> meerly <hi>transcient,</hi> or a simple <hi>operation</hi> of our <hi>spirit,</hi> for that would be <hi>little</hi> in comparison of what <hi>God</hi> requires. But we must pass fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bear in the <hi>bottom</hi> of our <hi>hearts</hi> the <hi>state</hi> wherein we propose these <hi>interior acts,</hi> that must be our principall <hi>end</hi> and <hi>intention.</hi> For though God onely hath <hi>power</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to put us into this <hi>estate,</hi> when, and how he pleases, yet, because in the wayes of <hi>grace,</hi> God doth ordinarily expect our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> and <hi>cooperation</hi>; it is for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the <hi>soul</hi> exerciseth her self in this <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> and it is upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:29616:233"/>
that she <hi>forms</hi> to her self these interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Acts,</hi> whereby she <hi>resignes</hi> and <hi>offers</hi> up to God her <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> So that in this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,</hi> the <hi>christian</hi> must not content himself to <hi>form</hi> this <hi>Act,</hi> and to <hi>pronounce</hi> the <hi>words,</hi> but he must demand of God the <hi>grace</hi> to bear a <hi>permanent estate</hi> thereof, and for his <hi>part,</hi> must do his utmost endeavour to <hi>attain</hi> it.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Containing certain interiour acts for those souls who are desirous to be established and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in true piety.</head>
               <p>THE first <hi>act</hi> of <hi>interiour piety</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which we are to practise fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently every day, is an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration.</hi> This I place <hi>first,</hi> because it is the <hi>first employment</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> and the <hi>first duty</hi> of the <hi>creature,</hi> who is obliged to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> its God with so much <hi>necessity,</hi> that the very Devills and damned are forced to do it; it is the <hi>first act</hi> that <hi>christian Religion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth. To form this <hi>act,</hi> we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Iesus Christ Sonne</hi> of God, both God and man, we must regard him as our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:29616:233"/>
Lord</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> as cause and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all our <hi>happiness.</hi> We must <hi>annihilate</hi> our selves before him, and <hi>humble</hi> our selves even to the <hi>bottom</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> willingly submitting to all that he is. This is called an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>adoration.</hi> It contains two <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> one of the <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> employ'd in considering and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in his <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi> looking on him as the <hi>principle</hi> of all <hi>good,</hi> and of all the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>esteeming</hi> and <hi>honouring</hi> him as such. Then followes an effect of the <hi>will,</hi> which <hi>humbles</hi> it self before him, <hi>receives</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> him as her <hi>God, King,</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> and with all its strength, <hi>submits,</hi> wholly to his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>greatness,</hi> in an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>adoration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may perceive, that <hi>adoration</hi> consists not onely in an <hi>esteem</hi> of God, be it never so <hi>highly elevated,</hi> but requires also a voluntary <hi>submission</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> with <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> of honour <hi>interiour</hi> and <hi>exteriour.</hi> He therefore who practiseth as he ought, an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>adoration,</hi> desireth alwayes to shew his respect by the <hi>effects.</hi> As the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is infinitely <hi>adorable,</hi> he who would <hi>adore</hi> him, strives daily to increase in <hi>adoration,</hi> and <hi>consequently</hi> endeavours with great <hi>fidelity,</hi> to subject himself more and more in <hi>will</hi> and <hi>deed,</hi> to the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

Christ.</hi> I say <hi>in will and deed,</hi> for it would avail but little, to say it onely with the <hi>mouth,</hi> and to have in <hi>thought</hi> the name and ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>greatness</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> if all our <hi>actions</hi> be full of our own <hi>will</hi>; and it were to little purpose to <hi>subject</hi> our selves by words to the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to the <hi>conduct</hi> of his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>motions,</hi> if in the management of our life, we follow the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> living in a continuall <hi>desire</hi> to satisfie our <hi>selves</hi> and our own <hi>inclinations.</hi> This were to say <hi>much,</hi> and do <hi>nothing.</hi> This we must be carefull in, since many deceive themselves in this kind of <hi>piety,</hi> which they so easily <hi>profess,</hi> contenting themselves with the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,</hi> and neglecting the rest. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he, who sayes we must <hi>adore</hi> God in <hi>spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4.24.</note> said also, we must adore him in <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>second act</hi> of this <hi>piety,</hi> is an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Oblation,</hi> whereby the <hi>soul</hi> offers her self wholly to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and renouncing her self, resignes into his hand <hi>all that she is, all</hi> the power that she hath <hi>over</hi> her <hi>self, over</hi> all her <hi>actions, over</hi> all <hi>things,</hi> and to make her <hi>self</hi> the more a servant to <hi>Iesus,</hi> in a <hi>perfect condition,</hi> she renounces her own <hi>liberty,</hi> and all the <hi>use</hi> she can make thereof, giving it up into the hands of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, of whom she received it, granting him all the <hi>right</hi>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:29616:234"/>
that she had to <hi>dispose</hi> thereof, to order it as he pleases, that being so resigned to <hi>Iesus,</hi> she may not <hi>have</hi> any thing more, nor <hi>be</hi> any thing more, but that he may <hi>be all, have all,</hi> and <hi>operate</hi> all in her. This <hi>Obligation</hi> thus conceived, is of great <hi>importance.</hi> For if it be done after the manner it ought, if the <hi>Son</hi> of God vouchsafe to <hi>accept</hi> it, it puts us in the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> in as much as it drawes the <hi>soul</hi> from her <hi>self</hi> and all <hi>creatures,</hi> to be <hi>Christ's,</hi> to <hi>adhere</hi> to him, to <hi>depend</hi> on him in all <hi>things,</hi> wherein consisteth <hi>true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, this <hi>Obligation</hi> is an effect of the <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> we have of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and contains the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christian subjection.</hi> For, as according to <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>slave</hi> is no more his own, nor hath any <hi>right</hi> over any thing, but is wholly left to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of his <hi>Master</hi>; so by this <hi>Obligation,</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> puts himself as nothing before <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; he gives place to all his <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> to be onely the subject of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>divine will.</hi> And though we are all <hi>servants</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by <hi>right</hi> and <hi>purchase,</hi> as we said elsewhere, yet we will be such also out of <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> giving him by this <hi>Oblation,</hi> a new <hi>power</hi> over us, that we may be the <hi>Captives</hi> to his <hi>love,</hi> as well as to his <hi>power,</hi> and submit to the <hi>designs</hi> of the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:29616:235"/>
eternall <hi>Father, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and translated us to the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus examining this <hi>Oblation,</hi> we find that it is <hi>necessary</hi> for all those who seek <hi>true piety,</hi> as containing the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi>; it puts the <hi>soul</hi> into a perfect <hi>denu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> and makes her entirely <hi>dependant</hi> and <hi>resigned</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to be <hi>led</hi> according to his <hi>will.</hi> They therefore who in their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises</hi> of <hi>piety</hi> make ordinary use of this <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> must <hi>weigh</hi> well what they say, and <hi>consider</hi> with what <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>faithfulness</hi> they proceed with the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For seeing they <hi>leave</hi> themselves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him in the <hi>quality</hi> of <hi>servants,</hi> and make <hi>profession (mark the word)</hi> to have nothing which is not <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>of him,</hi> and <hi>that by this Oblation,</hi> they yeild up all to <hi>him,</hi> even to the <hi>use</hi> of their own <hi>life</hi> and <hi>naturall liberty,</hi> what have they more to think of, but <hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>faithfully</hi> to <hi>accomplish</hi> what they <hi>profess</hi>? What have they more to do, but to take <hi>care</hi> that their <hi>life</hi> be conformable to what they <hi>say,</hi> otherwise they shall be constrained to <hi>condemn</hi> themselves, and to confess that they have no <hi>devotion</hi> any further then the <hi>mouth,</hi> that they <hi>deal</hi> not <hi>sincerely</hi> w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>God</hi> and their own <hi>consciences</hi>? It concerns them to take heed that that is not <hi>justly</hi> to be <hi>attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:29616:235"/>
to them which the <hi>Prophet</hi> said, <hi>Cursed are they that do the work of the Lord negligently.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To these <hi>Exercises</hi> of <hi>interiour piety</hi> we may add a third <hi>act: Purity of Intention.</hi> By this <hi>intention,</hi> the <hi>Christian,</hi> who offers himself to God in the manner we have described, begins to refer himself <hi>actually</hi> to <hi>him</hi> and to his <hi>glory,</hi> protesting that in <hi>all things,</hi> even to the least, and in <hi>all his actions,</hi> he will have no other <hi>intention</hi> then the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and <hi>live</hi> no longer, nor <hi>act</hi> any thing but according to the <hi>intention</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Having made this <hi>protestation,</hi> he demands of him <hi>participation</hi> of his <hi>holy spirit,</hi> and prayes him to <hi>inspire</hi> him with <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>pure dispositions,</hi> whereby he may accomplish his <hi>actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>piety</hi> is little known, and perhaps little understood, yet it is <hi>necessary</hi> for a <hi>perfect Christian.</hi> To <hi>conceive</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> it, he is to remember, that, (as we have said) <hi>true piety</hi> contains a <hi>resignation</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> to the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and to the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus;</hi> and that this <hi>resignation</hi> is more then a bare simple <hi>resignation,</hi> for it includes <hi>annihilation</hi> and <hi>unity; annihilation</hi> of our own <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> with the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to which we <hi>resigne</hi> our selves.

               <p>Hence it may be inferr'd, how <hi>necessary</hi> this <hi>intention</hi> is to all those <hi>souls</hi> that thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>true piety</hi>; but to make a fuller discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, we are to reflect on our own <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi> and <hi>incapacity,</hi> which is so great, that we know not what is <hi>lawfull</hi> for us to <hi>desire,</hi> and are <hi>ignorant</hi> of what we ought to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of God, as not <hi>understanding</hi> what <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes Iesus Christ</hi> may have upon us. We must therefore <hi>wait</hi> till he <hi>enlighten</hi> us, and <hi>inspire</hi> us.

It is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who says,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26, 27</note> 
                  <hi>We know not how to pray as we ought, but the spirit makes intercession for us by groans that cannot be uttered.</hi> He who searches the <hi>heart,</hi> knows what is the <hi>desire</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi>; he sueth for the <hi>Saints</hi> according to the <hi>will</hi> of God. Here we are taught this <hi>practice,</hi> which shews us that our <hi>prayers, desires,</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> must be inspired by the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who knows what <hi>God</hi> demands of us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This also shewes how <hi>unprofitable,</hi> and <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous</hi> their employment is, who fill their <hi>hearts</hi> with <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>intentions,</hi> and perplex themselves with <hi>multiplicity</hi> of <hi>thoughts,</hi> who conceive <hi>desires,</hi> and form <hi>designes</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one way, sometimes another, (though upon occasions, in appearance, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi>) since they do onely what pleases themselves.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> is a <hi>subjection</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, spirit,</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> a <hi>subjection</hi> that amounts to a <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude,</hi> and such as makes the <hi>soul</hi> capable to receive the <hi>communications</hi> of God, to bear the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> and to enter into a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> effect puts the <hi>soul</hi> into a <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>regard</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> which makes her <hi>vigilant</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> to do and <hi>desire</hi> nothing but the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; to regard nothing but his <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> so as to have no <hi>eyes</hi> but for <hi>Iesus,</hi> no more <hi>life,</hi> but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to the <hi>honour</hi> of his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>divine actions.</hi> This <hi>adherence</hi> to, and <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> on the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> raiseth in a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> a <hi>true imitation</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> to such a degree of <hi>perfection,</hi> that he becomes a lively <hi>representation</hi> and <hi>image</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi> Of these three <hi>effects,</hi> we must speak particularly, for herein consisteth the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>

of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Christian piety.</hi> We begin with the first.</p>
               <p>The <hi>subjection</hi> which by this <hi>adherence</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is begotten in us, represents two things; the <hi>power</hi> he hath over us, and the <hi>capacity</hi> we are in to bear the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>power.</hi> The <hi>power</hi> which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath over us, is a particular <hi>power,</hi> which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires by the <hi>mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and by all the <hi>states</hi> &amp; <hi>moments</hi> of his <hi>life</hi>; a <hi>power</hi> that gives him a double <hi>right</hi> to do in us, and with us, what ever he pleases, a <hi>power</hi> from which he <hi>imprints</hi> in the <hi>centre</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> the time that we were first made <hi>Christians,</hi> an <hi>eternall</hi> and <hi>indispensable power.</hi> In a word, it is a <hi>power</hi> which he establish'd by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> and left to the <hi>Church</hi>; For if we consider them, we shall find, that besides the <hi>graces</hi> which they <hi>communicate</hi> to us, they have other extraordinary <hi>effects</hi> expressing the <hi>power Christ</hi> assumes over us: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; <hi>Baptisme</hi> gives us <hi>grace,</hi> and blots out all <hi>sin</hi> in us, but withall, put us into a <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>service</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>imprints</hi> in our <hi>souls</hi> a character of <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power,</hi> a character never to be <hi>defaced,</hi> in <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>service</hi> which the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> underwent by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> becoming man, and a servant, <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi> himself to the <hi>Father,</hi> he was always,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:29616:238"/>
and shall be for ever, <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>coeternal</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> and in <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>gift</hi> which the <hi>eternall Father</hi> makes us of his <hi>Son,</hi> by the <hi>incarnation</hi> and <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> with <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in man, and of man in <hi>God.</hi> The same <hi>Son</hi> of God instituted the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> wherein he <hi>gives</hi> and <hi>unites</hi> himself to us, that he may <hi>live</hi> in us, and we in him. By this way of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> he takes <hi>power</hi> over us to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> in us all that he pleases, and shews the <hi>power</hi> that he hath over our <hi>souls,</hi> to establish therein continually his <hi>designs,</hi> to <hi>glorify</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thereby, and please himself in them.</p>
               <p>In pursuit of this <hi>power,</hi> he puts us into an <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>subjection,</hi> yet such as gives us a <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> to rceive and to bear in us the force of his <hi>love,</hi> and of all the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>life, grace,</hi> and <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them according to what manner and time he shall please to <hi>communicate</hi> them.

               </p>
               <p>The very <hi>mysteries</hi> of our <hi>faith</hi> acquaint us with this <hi>truth,</hi> and discover unto us the <hi>designes</hi> whereby the <hi>Son</hi> of God would <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> us to a <hi>participation</hi> of his <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and the severall <hi>estates</hi> of his <hi>life.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> of God becoming man by <hi>incarnation</hi> takes possession of the <hi>nature</hi> of man, of our <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and of our <hi>souls,</hi> by which he <hi>acquires</hi> a <hi>right</hi> to his <hi>nature</hi> to <hi>advance</hi> and <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate</hi> it to himself after what manner he pleases; as by this <hi>work</hi> of <hi>love</hi> he took <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature</hi> upon him, assuming <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> which he <hi>appropriated</hi> to himself, and <hi>elevated</hi> to all the <hi>greatness</hi> of the <hi>divinity,</hi> communicating to it for ever the <hi>person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of God.

them to <hi>adherence</hi> and <hi>union</hi> of <hi>spirit</hi> with him, and by a particular <hi>indulgence,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth them in a <hi>communication</hi> of his <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> To this end he <hi>applies</hi> and <hi>employes</hi> his <hi>power,</hi> to which a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be most <hi>vigilant</hi> and <hi>attentive,</hi> that he may alwayes continue in the <hi>subjection</hi> he owes to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>accept, receive,</hi> and bear the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> is <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> upon the common <hi>doctrine,</hi>

               <p>This first <hi>disposition</hi> leads us farther, and

advances us in the wayes of <hi>piety,</hi> and puts us into a second <hi>disposition,</hi> by which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>submission,</hi> all the <hi>estates</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> that the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> shall <hi>operate</hi> in us, and bear with <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> whatsoever <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> we meet with.

                  <hi>principle</hi> of our <hi>being</hi> in the state of <hi>grace.</hi> And if we would make use as we ought of the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and of the <hi>gifts</hi> we receive of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, we must em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them wholly to his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> in such sort, that as <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Authour</hi> of our <hi>being, life</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> he may also be their <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an inseparable <hi>obligation,</hi> and an indispensable <hi>duty.</hi> For if the <hi>Christian</hi> and all that is in him, proceed from the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, and is <hi>consecrated</hi> to him by his <hi>death,</hi> it followes, that he can neither make use of himself or any thing else, but the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God; otherwise he might refer his <hi>actions</hi> to some other then <hi>him</hi> to whom they are due, and for whom they are <hi>consecrated,</hi> which were to <hi>prophane</hi> the most <hi>holy things,</hi> and to enjoy the <hi>gifts</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> against his <hi>intentions,</hi> which is a <hi>sacrilegious treason</hi> against the <hi>divine Majesty.</hi> For as amongst men he is guilty of <hi>theft,</hi> and deserves <hi>death,</hi> who converts the <hi>treasure</hi> of his <hi>Prince</hi> to his private use, to passe away his <hi>life</hi> in <hi>vanities</hi> and <hi>sports</hi>; so is that <hi>Christian</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall, who abuses the <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, and is prodigall of the <hi>Treasures</hi> of his <hi>bounty.</hi> That we receive all from the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God no man can doubt, for of him and for him <hi>life</hi> is given us, as also <hi>motions, sense,

reason, repose, health,</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> and, in a word, the use of all things.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Treasures</hi> of his <hi>Court,</hi> for he hath by his <hi>travels</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by the price of his <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> purchased our <hi>lives,</hi> our <hi>actions,</hi> our <hi>thoughts,</hi> nay even the <hi>time</hi> which we enjoy.

               <p>This manner of <hi>rendring honour</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> to the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is an exercise of <hi>piety</hi> that we ought to perswade all <hi>Christians</hi> to, and is grounded upon the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which teach us, that all the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> be it of God towards men, or of men towards God, relate to <hi>Iesus</hi> as their <hi>principall</hi> support, prop and foundation, for it is by him that the <hi>eternall Father</hi> gives us
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29616:247"/>
all, in as much as he hath chosen the <hi>holy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> of his onely <hi>Sonne,</hi> as an <hi>instrument</hi> conjoyned to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> to operate his <hi>works</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and upon <hi>Earth.</hi> By him he receives the <hi>homage</hi> and <hi>adorations</hi> of his people, and of all men in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> Hence it may be inferr'd, that all is grounded upon <hi>Iesus,</hi> all subsists by him, that all may be <hi>united</hi> to him, and by him, to the <hi>Father.

               </p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>truth,</hi> we ought to make often reflections, for God hath <hi>subjected</hi> the <hi>World</hi> to our use, and given us his <hi>Sonne</hi>; the <hi>Sonne</hi> I say, out of an excess of incomparable <hi>love,</hi> becomes wholly <hi>ours,</hi> that by a mutuall <hi>right</hi> we may be wholly <hi>his,</hi> and by him the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,</hi> that we may say to him in <hi>piety,</hi> as he said to his <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>love, All that is mine is thine, and all that is thine is mine.</hi> Yea my <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> thou art mine, by thy <hi>Incarnation</hi> thou art mine, by the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of thy <hi>life</hi> mine, thou gavest me thy <hi>spirit</hi> in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> thy <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> thy <hi>glory</hi> I shall have in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and thou mayst say truly, that what is <hi>thine</hi> is <hi>mine.</hi> So order it then, that I may say to thee with as much <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> as thou hast expressed <hi>affection</hi> in giving thy self to me, that whatever is <hi>mine,</hi> is also <hi>thine,</hi> my <hi>being,</hi> my <hi>life,</hi> my <hi>actions,</hi> my <hi>love,</hi> all <hi>thine,</hi>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:29616:247"/>
but much more truly then my <hi>own,</hi> for it is in me but by thee, and for thee.

               </p>
               <p>Hence we are to conclude, that the first <hi>design</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> we are to have in our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi> is to refer all our <hi>actions</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>remember</hi> him before we <hi>think</hi> of our selves, to seek his <hi>glory</hi> before we look upon our own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi> or <hi>necessities.</hi> Herein the greatest part of <hi>Christians</hi> at this day are deceived, not onely those who in the exercises of <hi>piety,</hi> seek the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> of men, and aspire onely to <hi>vanity</hi> and a fleshly <hi>spirit,</hi> but even those who seem to follow the exercises of <hi>piety</hi> with most <hi>love</hi> and <hi>purity.</hi> For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they do much in seeking the <hi>occasions</hi> of <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>employing</hi> themselves in what <hi>promotes</hi> their <hi>spirituall advancement,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some relish and enjoyment therein, whenever there is <hi>occasion,</hi> they make it their onely <hi>businesse,</hi> their <hi>principall employment,</hi> it takes up their chiefest <hi>thoughts,</hi> and what is worse, they often place their <hi>end</hi> therein, and are perswaded that they have attained a <hi>high</hi> and <hi>perfect degree</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> imagining themselves rich in <hi>merits,</hi> and far advanced
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:29616:248"/>
in the wayes of <hi>perfection,</hi> and that they may serve God with <hi>delight.</hi> He is blind who sees not the <hi>danger</hi> those are in, who live thus, for while they think they <hi>serve</hi> God, they <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> mind their own <hi>profit,</hi> and if the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be well examin'd, you will find they change the <hi>glory</hi> of God into their own <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular satisfaction,</hi> the end of their exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, being their own <hi>content</hi> and <hi>interests,</hi> of whom we may say with the Apostle, <hi>They love and seek themselves,</hi>

               <p>To reform this <hi>universall</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, we must consider, that as the <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>true piety,</hi> consisteth in <hi>loving, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring,</hi> and <hi>serving</hi> of God, in order to an <hi>adherence</hi> to him, and a <hi>dependance</hi> on his <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> will; so the <hi>motive, object</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> we are to have in our <hi>devotions,</hi> must onely be the <hi>honour, love,</hi> and <hi>service</hi> of God, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with his amorous <hi>conduct.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> therefore who would live in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of true <hi>piety,</hi> must first by a voluntary <hi>subjection,</hi> adhere to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, as we have already shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and further refer himself wholly to the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> in as much as we are his, and by him, God's, and render to God the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>service</hi> we owe him. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this <hi>advice,</hi> the <hi>perfect Christian</hi> must
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:29616:248"/>
have a <hi>continuall</hi> and <hi>vigilant care</hi> so to <hi>order</hi> it, that his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> may be accounted worthy of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as being such as shall <hi>contribute</hi> to his <hi>glory</hi> after the manner he would have it; which is to be done thus.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:29616:249"/>This granted, it follows, that the <hi>Christian</hi> who desires to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> must on the one side shun all manner of <hi>sin,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially such as may <hi>ruine</hi> this <hi>grace</hi> in him; on the other, become very <hi>attentive</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> to receive the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> and the <hi>operations</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, that so he may <hi>cooperate</hi> therewith according to his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> otherwise it is to be <hi>feared,</hi> he may lose it, or at least hinder it's <hi>effects,</hi> and so destroy the <hi>honour</hi> of God, and all that the <hi>Son</hi> of God hath <hi>established</hi> in his <hi>soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is grounded upon the very <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>faith</hi>; For we can do nothing of our selves, as of our selves, but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> doth all in us, <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>referring</hi> all our <hi>actions</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Father.</hi> We must then let him <hi>act,</hi> and, as we know not his <hi>divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> and <hi>designes</hi> over us, neither know the <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> whereto he would <hi>elevate</hi> us for his greater <hi>glory,</hi> (for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him to do all, when and how he pleases.) It remains then, that we <hi>oppose</hi> not our selves to his <hi>intentions,</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> not his <hi>works.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> therefore, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to be God's, and to <hi>live</hi> in <hi>true piety,</hi> must not amuse himself in these <hi>unprofitable</hi> and <hi>superficiall</hi> things, nor regard so much these <hi>exercises,</hi> but <hi>purifie</hi> himself, and make himself worthy of the <hi>grace</hi> of God, taking
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:29616:250"/>
great care to preserve himself therein, and have a continuall <hi>attention</hi> to all that the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> operates in him, for the <hi>glory</hi> of God, that he destroy it not by a contrary <hi>application</hi> and want of <hi>co-operation.</hi> Hereby we shall see how many false <hi>devotions</hi> there are, and how many deceive themselves in the exercise of <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These two wayes of honouring the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> may be understood after two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereby we may <hi>honour Iesus Christ,</hi> and he may <hi>honour</hi> himself in us two wayes, one by <hi>action,</hi> the other by <hi>estate.</hi> The <hi>action</hi> is transient, and is but for a little time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is but in one part of the <hi>soul,</hi> but <hi>estate is a thing permanent</hi> which dwells in the whole <hi>capacity</hi> of the <hi>creature,</hi> and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the bottom of its <hi>being,</hi> having no dependance on the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> We may act well in the first manner, and it is good, but we must also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>establish</hi> our selves in an <hi>estate</hi> which perfectly <hi>honours</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For as the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself hath not onely <hi>honoured</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> by the <hi>actions</hi> of his <hi>transitory life,</hi> but hath been pleased to become man, and take upon him a <hi>nature</hi> which <hi>essentially</hi> is in a <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>servitude,</hi> and remain perpetually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably therein, in regard of his <hi>Divinity:</hi>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:29616:250"/>
so we must endeavour to <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> not onely by <hi>transitory actions,</hi> but also by a permanent <hi>estate</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> such as may render him <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>perpetuall homage.</hi> This we are obliged to do for our part, to the utmost of our <hi>power,</hi> as being one of the most <hi>essentiall exercises</hi> of <hi>piety.</hi> But our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are feeble, and all we can do is little, in comparison of what we owe God. The <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> therefore who is our <hi>supplyer,</hi> doth it sometimes himself by his <hi>grace</hi>; by his <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>amorous attractions,</hi> he calls us, and puts us into the <hi>estate</hi> which he himself <hi>operates</hi> in us, by which he satisfies his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi> It is a singular <hi>happiness,</hi> a <hi>favour,</hi> to obtain which all we can do, is to continue disposed, attentive to whatever the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God operates in us, and carefully to take heed thereto, and to <hi>co-operate faithfully</hi> therein, and with the best <hi>disposition,</hi> may be proposed. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof is, to keep our selves in a <hi>simple submission</hi> of our <hi>spirit</hi> to that of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, and this <hi>submission</hi> consisteth in not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting</hi> it, but, leaving our selves wholly to the <hi>power</hi> of, and a <hi>dependance</hi> on his <hi>holy spirit</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> giving up, offering and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selves to the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>designes</hi> which he hath in and upon us, renouncing all our own contrary <hi>inclinations.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi>

that <hi>lives</hi> in this <hi>submission,</hi> is capable to bear <hi>effectually</hi> the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and to <hi>honour</hi> God in all things.</p>
               <p>Now when it is said, that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all our <hi>actions</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, we mean not onely the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but even the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>naturall actions,</hi> even to a moment of time, for all belongs to God, and must be referred to his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi> This <hi>truth</hi> we learn of the <hi>Church</hi> our <hi>Mother,</hi> who in her <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> doth not onely represent the <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>honours</hi> them in representing them, and as such is her <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whence it may be observed, that in all her <hi>ceremonies,</hi> even to the least, she intends to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> him. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself may be also an example to us in this exercise of <hi>piety,</hi> for in that he hath taken the <hi>nature</hi> of man upon him, he hath <hi>honoured</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> in all things, and by all the <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>humane nature,</hi> doing to that <hi>end</hi> and <hi>intention,</hi> not onely those <hi>actions</hi> which we call <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>vertuous,</hi> but even those which are <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>purely humane,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to his <hi>honour,</hi> all the moments of his <hi>life.</hi> We must carry our selves in the same manner, what he did being done by him, as a <hi>Master</hi> for our <hi>imitation.</hi> The <hi>devout Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> therefore must refer all his <hi>exercises</hi> and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:29616:251"/>
                  <hi>actions,</hi> both <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>common, little</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> to the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> By this <hi>relation,</hi> our <hi>actions</hi> are ennobled, for what he hath <hi>sanctified,</hi> is neither <hi>common</hi> nor <hi>inconsiderable</hi>; whatsoever is <hi>consecrated</hi> and <hi>referred</hi> by his <hi>honour,</hi> cannot but be <hi>great,</hi> when his <hi>honour</hi> is so <hi>great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are a many that judge this <hi>practise of Piety</hi> to be too <hi>difficult,</hi> whereas they will indifferently receive some others. But if we consider it, we shall find that it is an <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> proper to the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which cannot by any meanes be <hi>dispenced</hi> with. For if the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> be a lively Image of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and a <hi>life</hi> derived and flowing from his, it must of necessity follow, that, as all things are <hi>sanctified,</hi> and made <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so are they such in us by the same <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> which is given us, which <hi>dwells</hi> in us, and <hi>operates</hi> in us. From which <hi>reason</hi> we may infer, that, as in <hi>Iesus</hi> there is nothing <hi>mean</hi> or <hi>vile,</hi> but all in him is <hi>elevated</hi> and <hi>referred</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> so in <hi>Christian souls,</hi> there ought to be no <hi>actions</hi> mean and <hi>object,</hi> no, not indifferent, seeing they all belong to the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who hath <hi>sanctified</hi> them in his <hi>spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> of him it is, that we are to <hi>operate</hi> and <hi>accomplish</hi> them. Besides, we cannot doubt at all, but that the <hi>Sonne</hi> of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:29616:252"/>
God hath his <hi>great designs</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy himself over our <hi>actions,</hi> even to the smalled, nay, over all the <hi>moments</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi> Which if it be so, how we can say, that our <hi>actions</hi> are indifferent? On the contrary, they belong all to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> they must proceed from his <hi>spirit</hi>; God will be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured</hi> in all that is of man. We shall render an account as well of the <hi>least</hi> as the <hi>greatest</hi> things; and assuredly, God will <hi>exercise</hi> his <hi>judgement</hi> as well for a <hi>moment</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and the least of our <hi>actions,</hi> as for all the rest of our <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must therefore acknowledge there is nothing <hi>little,</hi> nothing to be <hi>neglected</hi> in the <hi>state of Christianity,</hi> but all therein ought to be worthy the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>cross</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; we must make use of all things <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably</hi> to the designs and <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> who, as he is always <hi>great,</hi> even in the <hi>least</hi> things, so also must we have <hi>great intentions,</hi> even in the <hi>meanest</hi> of our <hi>actions,</hi> and our <hi>first</hi> and <hi>principall</hi> must be to <hi>referr</hi> those to the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the time of his <hi>life</hi> upon <hi>earth,</hi> did so; <hi>living</hi> among us as one of us, he made use of all things with a <hi>zeal</hi> to the <hi>honour</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>referred</hi> them to him as to his <hi>Father,</hi> his <hi>principall being</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> Let us do the <hi>like,</hi> and by a <hi>zeal</hi> to the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi>

out of a <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>homage</hi> to his <hi>greatness,</hi> let us offer to him all our <hi>actions,</hi> &amp; accomplish them all even to the <hi>least,</hi> with a desire that they may be <hi>referred</hi> to him as to the <hi>principle</hi> of our <hi>being</hi> and <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> This he taught us by his <hi>death,</hi> this <hi>disposition</hi> he inspires us with by <hi>grace,</hi> this <hi>spirit</hi> he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth</hi> into us by the <hi>Sacraments</hi> which he hath <hi>left</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>himself</hi> said, <hi>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father;<note place="margin">Joh. 6.17.</note> so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me</hi>; which include in two <hi>words</hi> all that we would perswade that <hi>Christian</hi> to, who seeks <hi>true piety.</hi>

               <p>AS we are <hi>obliged</hi> to honour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by our <hi>life,</hi> and all our <hi>actions,</hi> so with much more reason are we <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>imitate</hi> him as far as lies in our <hi>power.</hi> The greatest <hi>honour</hi> we can give him, is to <hi>conform</hi> our selves to his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>intentions.</hi> This is the third <hi>effect</hi> which produces <hi>adherence</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and as this <hi>adherence</hi> is the first <hi>estate</hi> whereinto we are put when we are made

                  <hi>Christians,</hi> and the first <hi>foundation</hi> we must lay to acquire <hi>true piety</hi>; so from this <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence</hi> as its <hi>centre</hi> and <hi>generall principle</hi> must be derived all the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> which we bear in our <hi>souls.</hi> Now, that which remains to be treated of, is this <hi>Imitation:</hi> for our <hi>life</hi> ought to be a <hi>lively Image</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the first use a <hi>Christian</hi> is to make, is to look upon the <hi>Son</hi> of God as the <hi>Prototype</hi> and <hi>exemplar</hi> of his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> not onely to <hi>imitate,</hi> but to <hi>express</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi> him, as it were, to the <hi>life.</hi> As the <hi>Son</hi> of God is the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>resemblance</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> so must the <hi>Christian</hi> be of the <hi>Son.</hi> Hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> assures us, that none shall be <hi>saved,</hi> or <hi>received</hi> into <hi>heaven</hi> in the number of the <hi>elect,</hi> if he be not conformed to the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:29616:253"/>
                  <hi>mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarnation,</hi> for giving his <hi>Son</hi> a new <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>mystery</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> and giving it to be <hi>communicated</hi> to us, he makes him thereby the <hi>principle</hi> of a <hi>new life</hi> in us, and wils, that, as he is the <hi>principle</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi> in <hi>eternall generation,</hi> so his <hi>Son</hi> should be the <hi>principle</hi> of our <hi>life</hi> in the new <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall generation</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> by <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also teaches this, when speaking of the <hi>reformation</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> he says, <hi>As we have born the image of the earthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.49.</note>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Doctrine</hi> is wholly <hi>conformable</hi> to the <hi>Principles of Christianity.</hi> The <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> honours and regards <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>imitates</hi> his <hi>life,</hi>

                  <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> saith <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; or to say better, it is the <hi>life</hi> of God himself who <hi>lives</hi> in us by his <hi>Son.</hi> Whence it follows, that as the <hi>Father lives</hi> in the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Father,</hi> so we <hi>live</hi> in <hi>Iesus,</hi> and <hi>Iesus</hi> in us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Prayer</hi> of the same <hi>Son</hi> of God to his <hi>Father</hi> full of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affection.

                  <hi>and thou in me, that they may be <pb n="484" facs="tcp:29616:254"/>
made perfect in one.</hi> But how can we be one with the <hi>Son</hi> of God? How can we <hi>adhere</hi> to him, and be <hi>incorporated</hi> with him? How can we conceive this <hi>reciprocall life</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> in us, but in <hi>imitating</hi> him, and not only <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating</hi> him, but expressing and perfectly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting</hi> him, since he <hi>lives</hi> in us, and we in him, in the <hi>mystery</hi> of the <hi>incarnation</hi>? For the <hi>eternall Father</hi> giving us his <hi>Son</hi> to be man, and to <hi>live</hi> with men a <hi>life</hi> common and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of men, he gives us in him a <hi>law, rule,</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and shews us in him the manner of <hi>conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that we must follow, to <hi>live Christianly,</hi> that is, to <hi>live</hi> a new <hi>life,</hi> which the <hi>eternall Father</hi> gives us in his <hi>Son,</hi> and by his <hi>Son,</hi> a <hi>life</hi> singularly proper to the <hi>estate</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> We are then to look on the <hi>Son</hi> of God as our <hi>Law, imitate</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> him as our <hi>rule,</hi> which is, to speak properly, as the <hi>sacred Oracles</hi> foretold, when, speaking of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and the time of his <hi>coming,</hi> they said, that God will make a <hi>Word</hi> abbridged upon the <hi>earth.</hi> This <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of God, who descending to the vile and mean <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>humane nature,</hi> gives us his <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> a model for ours.</p>
               <p>This also Saint <hi>Paul</hi> explains, where he says that God spoke to the <hi>world</hi> four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:29616:254"/>
years,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.1, 2</note> and <hi>conducted</hi> and taught men <hi>after divers manners,</hi> and sent <hi>Angels,</hi> he gave a <hi>Law</hi> writ with his own <hi>hand,</hi> he prescribed many <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and in all ages caused <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> to speak. But in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> he <hi>speaks to us by his Sonne,</hi> who teacheth us <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall truths,</hi> till then unknown to the <hi>World,</hi> and reserved for the Excellency of the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> now guide us no more, but attend us, the written <hi>Law</hi> doth not <hi>oblige</hi> us, the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are now <hi>limited,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> speak no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It is <hi>Iesus,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> of the eternall <hi>Father,</hi> who becoming man, and conversing among men, <hi>speaks</hi> to us, and <hi>teaches</hi> us. He is our <hi>Angel</hi> to inlighten us, our <hi>Law</hi> to direct us, our <hi>Prophet</hi> to speak to us, and our <hi>Master</hi> to teach us. He is the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg'd word,</hi> and by the <hi>condition</hi> that he hath made with his <hi>Father,</hi> he <hi>conducts</hi> us by his <hi>spirit,</hi> he illuminates us by his <hi>grace,</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us by his <hi>providence,</hi> and he is the <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> so he teaches us not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his <hi>words,</hi> but also by the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable actions</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>rule,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>modell</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Iesus</hi> be <hi>the rule and law of our life,</hi> it is manifest that we ought to <hi>imitate</hi> him, if we would live <hi>Christianly,</hi> and if, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of a <hi>solid piety,</hi> we desire to attain a
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:29616:255"/>
                  <hi>perfection</hi> suitable to the <hi>vocation</hi> and <hi>estate</hi> we profess, we must choose none but those which imitate the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, holding it a <hi>maxime</hi> in all kindes of exercises, that the <hi>Christian</hi> is so much the more <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> the more conformable his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are to those of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that he is neither <hi>devout</hi> nor <hi>perfect,</hi> but as far as he <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for <hi>true piety</hi> and <hi>Christian perfection,</hi> if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, consisteth onely in this point.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Precept,</hi> we have also from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> where he sayes, <hi>If any man serve me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 12.26.</note> 
                  <hi>let him follow me, and where I am there my servant shall be also</hi>; the servant of God must imitate <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> To <hi>serve</hi> is nothing else but to <hi>follow,</hi> to follow, according to St. <hi>Austine,</hi> is to <hi>imitate;</hi> so that the <hi>devotion</hi> whereby we should serve God, is not <hi>devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> but <hi>illusion,</hi> if it be not in the exercises which cause us to <hi>follow</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we may see how much they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who dare call him <hi>rash,</hi> and accuse him of <hi>presumption,</hi> that would <hi>imitate Iesus Christ</hi>; who say it is to soar too high, and that it is impossible man should <hi>imitate</hi> his God, and blinded with this <hi>ignorance,</hi> are content to employ themselves in some good <hi>morall exercises.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> condemns this
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:29616:255"/>
errour, saying, <hi>Iesus Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet 2.21.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> confesses, that his study and principall care was to <hi>imitate Iesus Christ</hi>; to which end,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1.</note> he writ to the <hi>Corinthians; Be ye followers of me, as I am of Iesus Christ.</hi> In a word, we are not made <hi>Christians,</hi> nor parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the <hi>graces</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, but to be put into a <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>imitate</hi> him. This is his intention when he sayes,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.38</note> 
                  <hi>who doth not follow him, is not worthy of him.</hi> To say the contrary, is to oppose the <hi>opinions</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> a <hi>truth</hi> more manifest then day.</p>
               <p>By these <hi>Principles,</hi> we discover another blindness greater then the other, a deceit more dangerous in many <hi>Christians,</hi> who onely study to perfect their <hi>reason,</hi> and think they do much to follow that in every point, wherein they are much deceived. For they believe it <hi>sufficient</hi> to live <hi>reasonably</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly,</hi> and in this belief, forget or neglect the rest, thinking they are arrived to an <hi>estate</hi> perfect enough. But is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for by the use of <hi>reason</hi> onely, we live as <hi>perfect</hi> men, or at most, but as good <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>; but if we would <hi>live</hi> and <hi>operate</hi> as good <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of God, we must advance our selves above <hi>Reason</hi> to live, not a humane, but a <hi>divine life,</hi> that is the <hi>life</hi> that
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:29616:256"/>
the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God liv'd upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and communicated to <hi>true Christians,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of the new man. To live this <hi>life,</hi> we make use not of <hi>reason</hi> but of <hi>grace,</hi> which is farre above <hi>reason,</hi> and must be the principle of <hi>Christian actions.</hi> For onely <hi>grace</hi> can bring us to God, and render us worthy of God, that is of God, considered as the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foundation of all consisteth in this, that a <hi>humane spirit</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> is not our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> nor the <hi>rule</hi> of our <hi>life</hi> as <hi>Christians; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> is the onely <hi>rule, law,</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> thereof, wherefore in our exercises of <hi>piety,</hi> we must have this continually before our eyes, if we would be <hi>devout, viz.</hi> we must <hi>follow</hi> him if we would be saved, and we must <hi>imitate</hi> him if we will <hi>follow</hi> him. Which we are now to consider, how it is to be done.</p>

               <p>WHen we speak of <hi>imitating</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, we mean not doing of <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> as he did; we are not commanded to walk upon the Sea, to raise up the <hi>dead</hi> to <hi>life,</hi> and to give <hi>sight</hi> to the <hi>blind.</hi> We mean not the being elevated to an intuitive knowledge of the <hi>secrets</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi>; this is onely for <hi>Iesus,</hi> these are the <hi>effects</hi> of his almighty <hi>power,</hi> and the marks of his <hi>Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> We are not called to come into <hi>competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with him, but, as he was <hi>humbled</hi> to our <hi>meanness,</hi> and was cloathed with our <hi>nature,</hi> becoming man, and taking <hi>a new being</hi> and <hi>estate</hi>; so he takes also a new <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> conformable to ours, which we ought to <hi>imitate,</hi> after which we are to form the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> of our <hi>Consciences,</hi> and the procedure of our <hi>actions.</hi> He <hi>annihilated</hi> himself in the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle;</hi> he <hi>humbled</hi> himself in all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of his <hi>life</hi>;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> he made himself poor in all his <hi>estates;</hi> he was <hi>obedient</hi> even to the <hi>Crosse,</hi> he suffered even to <hi>death,</hi> he hath shewed his <hi>love</hi> in all his
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:29616:257"/>
                  <hi>works.</hi> In a word, he practised all manner of <hi>vertues</hi> in the progress of his <hi>life.</hi> Let us do the like; he was born for our <hi>sakes,</hi> and all that he did was onely that he might <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> him as the <hi>modell</hi> of our <hi>life.</hi> For this reason he chose a kind of <hi>life</hi> full of <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous estates,</hi> and practised severall <hi>actions,</hi> that all sorts of <hi>persons</hi> in all manner of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi> should find in him the <hi>Idaea</hi> of their <hi>actions,</hi> and the <hi>prototype</hi> of their <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to <hi>imitate Iesus Christ,</hi> is an <hi>Obligation</hi> belonging to the state of <hi>Christianity.</hi> When we receive <hi>Baptisme,</hi> we are <hi>incorporated</hi> into him as <hi>members</hi>; this <hi>incorporation</hi> doth not onely bind us to adhere to him as <hi>members</hi> to their <hi>head,</hi> but to be like him, and to have as much <hi>conformity</hi> in our <hi>actions</hi> to those of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> as there is between the <hi>head</hi> and the <hi>members</hi> of the same body. So that this <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> must not be indifferent, but most <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> All <hi>as many of you,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>as are baptized into Ie. Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> 
                  <hi>have put on Christ,</hi> that is, ye bear his <hi>Livery,</hi> and, as the <hi>Doctors</hi> interpret it, ye are made <hi>like unto him,</hi> ye <hi>imitate</hi> his <hi>vertues,</hi> and are <hi>followers</hi> of his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> For it is but reason, that where the <hi>head</hi> is, there the <hi>members</hi> should also be, and that there be a <hi>resemblance</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> of the one to the other.</p>
               <p>To <hi>imitate</hi> then the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> implies
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:29616:257"/>
                  <hi>two things</hi>; the one is, that we do what he hath done, the other, that we do it with the same <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>dispositions</hi> wherewith he did it. He was <hi>humbled</hi> for us, he shewed his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>clemency</hi> towards us: Let us also learn of him to be <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>humble of heart.</hi> He was <hi>obedient</hi> even to <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>death of the Crosse</hi>; let us <hi>imitate</hi> his <hi>obedience,</hi> preferring the accomplishment of his <hi>divine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>holy will,</hi> before all things, even our own <hi>life.</hi> He was born in a <hi>stable,</hi> layd in a <hi>manger,</hi> he took <hi>poverty</hi> for the <hi>companion</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> he condemned the <hi>World,</hi> and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed its <hi>pride,</hi> shewing us, that all is <hi>vanity,</hi> and a meer nothing in the eyes of God. Let us do the same, and, though we are in the <hi>World,</hi> condemn its <hi>vanity,</hi> in a word, so use it, that all our <hi>life interiour</hi> and <hi>exteriour,</hi> may be a continuall <hi>imitation</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi> This is the <hi>true piety</hi> that a <hi>Christian</hi> must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, the onely meanes to be <hi>perfect.</hi> In this <hi>imitation</hi> and <hi>resemblance,</hi> consisteth the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> as well in the state of <hi>grace,</hi> as of <hi>glory. We know that when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear we shall be like him, we shall see him as he is,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> If then we shall be like him in <hi>glory,</hi> we must also be like him in <hi>grace</hi>; for <hi>glory</hi> is nothing but <hi>grace consummated,</hi> grace glory <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:29616:258"/>But we must not rest here, it is not enough to <hi>do</hi> barely what the <hi>Son</hi> of God hath <hi>done,</hi> we may deceive our selves herein, <hi>believing</hi> we <hi>do much,</hi> when we <hi>do nothing</hi> of <hi>value,</hi> because <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> being man as we are, and conversing amongst us; no doubt but we may find some <hi>conformity</hi> and <hi>resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> to him, even among the <hi>wicked</hi> in the common <hi>states</hi> of men; many <hi>suffer</hi> and are <hi>oppressed,</hi> many <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>humbled,</hi> many <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester</hi> themselves from the <hi>pomp</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>obscurity</hi> of a <hi>solitary life</hi>; many <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and do almost all the <hi>exteriour actions,</hi> that the <hi>Son</hi> of God <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised</hi> upon <hi>earth.</hi> He was man <hi>as we are,</hi> we are men <hi>as he was,</hi> but this does not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> us, this is no <hi>imitation</hi> of him, the reason is because it is not enough to do as he did, but we must do it with the <hi>spirit,</hi> in the <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> and by the <hi>principle</hi> that he <hi>operates,</hi> which few persons mind. It is not enough <hi>to do,</hi> but we must <hi>do it</hi> by a <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> not of generall <hi>grace,</hi> comprised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>generall</hi> name we give to all the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, which is an usuall way of speaking, but of <hi>grace</hi> which giveth us <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> communicateth to us his <hi>spirit,</hi> and puts us into the <hi>holy dispositions</hi> of his <hi>soul.</hi> So that doing all things by this <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> we perfectly <hi>imitate</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of God, so
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:29616:258"/>
far, that our naturall common <hi>actions</hi> are withdrawn from their <hi>meanness,</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> and <hi>united</hi> to those of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, after a particular manner, as being <hi>operated</hi> by the same <hi>principle,</hi> and with the same <hi>dispositions.</hi> This manner of acting is peculiar to the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and in all <hi>circumstances,</hi> conformable to the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace;</hi> for by <hi>Christian grace,</hi> we are <hi>new creatures, creatures</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we have a <hi>new being</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> Which if we have, we must also have <hi>new inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> another <hi>goodness,</hi> and all our <hi>actions</hi> must be conformable to this <hi>new estate,</hi> seeing that according to the ordinary <hi>maxims,</hi> the <hi>work</hi> is according to the <hi>being.</hi> Now, as the <hi>being</hi> we have by <hi>Christian grace</hi> is wholy <hi>divine, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> it followes, that all our <hi>actions</hi> must be <hi>elevated</hi> and <hi>done</hi> in <hi>Iesus.</hi> For this the <hi>Son</hi> of God humbled himself to all <hi>practices</hi> and <hi>exercises,</hi> to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble</hi> and <hi>sanctify</hi> them; for according to the <hi>Fathers, Iesus</hi> entring into the <hi>waters</hi> in the day of his <hi>Baptisme,</hi> by his touching them, he <hi>sanctifies</hi> the <hi>waters</hi> of our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>he sanctified the world, and blessed it by his conversation.</hi> So by the use he hath made of <hi>humane nature,</hi> wherewith he hath clothed himself, and of all the <hi>exercises</hi> and <hi>functions</hi> proper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:29616:259"/>
he <hi>sanctify'd</hi> ours, shewing that we may <hi>imitate</hi> him, seeing he became man to be the <hi>rule, law</hi> and <hi>model</hi> of our <hi>actions,</hi> and not onely <hi>imitate</hi> him, but <hi>express</hi> and <hi>represent</hi> him to the <hi>life,</hi> and be so many <hi>Christ's,</hi> as <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God. We must be one with him, and consequently must not <hi>operate</hi> but with him, and in his <hi>person,</hi> not in our own. For this cause he gives us his <hi>spirit</hi> whereby we <hi>act;</hi> or, to say better, he <hi>acts</hi> all in us; It follows, that they are not so much our <hi>vertues,</hi> as those of <hi>Iesus</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>Herein appears the great <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Christian vertues</hi> and <hi>morall,</hi> or <hi>humane.</hi> For instance, The <hi>love</hi> God requires of a <hi>Christian,</hi> must not be that of a <hi>Pagan,</hi> who <hi>loves</hi> them that <hi>love</hi> him, nor that of a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,</hi> who <hi>loves</hi> according to his <hi>humour,</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> much less that of a <hi>Iew,</hi> who <hi>loves</hi> not, but out of an hope of <hi>reward</hi> promised, or a fear of <hi>Iudgments.</hi> The <hi>love</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> must be the same with that of <hi>Iesus,</hi> that is, he must <hi>love</hi> with the same <hi>love</hi> wherewith <hi>Iesus loves,</hi> he must <hi>love</hi> with the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> as he must <hi>live</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Iesus.</hi>

                  <hi>Walk in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul, as Iesus Christ hath loved you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.34</note> The <hi>Son</hi> of God himself in the Eve of his <hi>passion,</hi> speaks thus to his <hi>Apostles, I give you a new Commandment, that ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I have loved you.</hi> To <hi>love</hi> is no <hi>new
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:29616:259"/>
Commandment,</hi> this law was imprinted in our <hi>hearts</hi> from the beginning of the <hi>world,</hi> but the <hi>manner of loving is new</hi>; we must <hi>love</hi> by the same <hi>love</hi> wherewith <hi>Iesus loved us,</hi> his <hi>love</hi> must be in us. O, how great is this <hi>love,</hi> how <hi>pure,</hi> how free from <hi>self-interest!</hi> how <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>powerfull,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.21, 22.</note> since, according to the <hi>Apostle,</hi> it is the same <hi>love,</hi> which made <hi>Iesus</hi> to be <hi>born,</hi> and <hi>die</hi> for us, even then, when we were his <hi>enemies,</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> raigning in us. The <hi>Son</hi> of God gives us a cleer testimony of this <hi>truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 17.26.</note> speaking to his <hi>Father, I have declared to them thy Name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.</hi> Expound as you please these words, you shall always find it most true, that <hi>Christian love,</hi> must be the same <hi>love</hi> with that of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and that what we say here of <hi>love,</hi> we must judge the like of all other <hi>Christian vertues</hi>; for, as we have alwayes said, <hi>Iesus</hi> is our <hi>vertue,</hi> our <hi>strength,</hi> our <hi>life,</hi> and our <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To possess this <hi>vertue</hi> in an eminent <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> as <hi>Christianity</hi> obliges us, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that this <hi>favour</hi> is not for all, and that it's not enough to have <hi>grace</hi> in the manner we commonly speak, but we must have <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in us, we must have his <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>holy dispositions,</hi> that we may <hi>imitate Christianity,</hi> and express his <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>life.</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:29616:260"/>
The <hi>Christian</hi> therefore who would acquire <hi>true devotion,</hi> and do the <hi>exercises</hi> thereof, must first of all <hi>purify</hi> his <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>conserve</hi> it in that <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> the motions and <hi>thoughts</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> that <hi>Iesus</hi> may dwell and <hi>act</hi> in him. To <hi>dispose</hi> him to this <hi>favour,</hi> he must often <hi>elevate</hi> his <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and demand of him part of his <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>holy dispositions,</hi> to accomplish <hi>Christianly</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> all things. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God are so many <hi>springs</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> a <hi>grace</hi> which he <hi>merited</hi> and <hi>communicateth</hi> to us, we must <hi>bind</hi> our selves to this <hi>grace,</hi> we must <hi>adore</hi> it, we must <hi>desire</hi> it, and <hi>demand</hi> it of him in all things, and in all our <hi>exercises,</hi> that our <hi>actions</hi> may be done in him, by him, and for him, according to his <hi>designes.</hi> This <hi>advice</hi> is further to be observed, that in the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>vertues,</hi> that we <hi>desire</hi> them not principally and onely for the <hi>love</hi> of them, nor acquire them because they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to <hi>Reason;</hi> or because they bring some <hi>excellency</hi> or <hi>benefit</hi> to the <hi>soul.</hi> For though <hi>vertue</hi> be <hi>seemly</hi> and <hi>profitable,</hi> and of it self much to be <hi>desired,</hi> yet it it not enough to <hi>desire</hi> to be <hi>vertuous</hi> upon these <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>principles,</hi> since this seems to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>covetousness</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; to <hi>live</hi> in his <hi>spirit,</hi> which onely aimed at <hi>elevation,</hi> and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:29616:260"/>
to make himself a <hi>little god,</hi> or to fall into the corruption of <hi>self-love,</hi> which follows only it's own <hi>interests, profit</hi> and <hi>satisfaction.</hi> To <hi>act purely,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>Christian piety,</hi> all must be done in the <hi>regard</hi> of God, for <hi>love,</hi> of him, and for his <hi>honour.</hi> We must <hi>seek</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> every <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> chiefly, to render our selves <hi>conformable</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> of God, to <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>please</hi> him. And as the first <hi>grace</hi> that God gives us in the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> is to make us his <hi>children,</hi> to <hi>incorporate</hi> us in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as <hi>members,</hi> and to put us into an <hi>adherence</hi> to him; so the first &amp; principall <hi>care</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> must be, to <hi>conserve</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> himself in his <hi>adherence,</hi> and to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to the <hi>effects</hi> thereof. Herein consists the <hi>happiness</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>essence</hi> of <hi>true piety,</hi> which is all we have to propose in this <hi>subject.</hi> But as all things have their <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and man is in a <hi>land</hi> of <hi>hostility,</hi> so he must expect to meet with great <hi>opposition</hi> in the way of <hi>vertue,</hi> and encounter <hi>enemies</hi> on all sides, and <hi>dangers</hi> at every step, we shall direct how to <hi>defend</hi> himself against them.</p>

               <p>There are <hi>four things</hi> which continually <hi>separate</hi> us from the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and <hi>force</hi> us to <hi>ruine,</hi> if his <hi>grace</hi> prevent us not. The <hi>first</hi> is our own <hi>nature,</hi> prone to evil, being taken out of <hi>nothing,</hi> it hath an <hi>inclination</hi> to that <hi>nothing,</hi> whence it came, to <hi>re-enter</hi> thereinto, and would <hi>infallibly return</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if the <hi>arm</hi> of God, who created it, did
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:29616:262"/>
not withhold and sustain it. Nay, this <hi>evill inclination</hi> of our <hi>being</hi> would not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>nothing,</hi> but to a <hi>nothing</hi> that is rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious against God, that is, to <hi>sin,</hi> which hath no other <hi>Originall,</hi> but (if we may so express it) the meanness of our being, which <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth</hi> all that God puts into us. The <hi>creature</hi> being drawn from nothing inclines to evill, if <hi>grace</hi> stay him not, saith St. <hi>Gregory.</hi> This is evident in the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> and the first man, which can onely be attributed to this <hi>nothing</hi> whence they were drawn, and which by a secret <hi>power,</hi> attracts them to it self. For before sin, there was not in these two <hi>natures</hi> any perverse <hi>inclination.</hi> But if this were in two natures so <hi>perfectly accomplish'd,</hi> what ought not we to fear who are not onely in this <hi>nothing,</hi> but after a manner much more <hi>miserable,</hi> without <hi>light,</hi> without <hi>grace,</hi> in a depraved <hi>nature</hi>; by the evill <hi>inclinations</hi> of our <hi>being,</hi> we have in us the <hi>source</hi> of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills. The <hi>senses</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> of the heart of man, as the <hi>holy Text</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>are inclined to evill continually,</hi> which ought continually to <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> us at the feet of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him to <hi>sustain</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> us, and never to suffer us to be <hi>separated</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>inclinations,</hi> and <hi>evill habits</hi> that are in us, the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>estates</hi> of <hi>originall sinne,</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:29616:263"/>
which are fixt to our <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>self-love</hi> therein are the <hi>second</hi> enemies which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually endeavour our <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> from God. The <hi>reason</hi> is, that our own <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> are easily fix'd on crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things, as being of the same <hi>order</hi> and <hi>condition.</hi> These <hi>applications</hi> are <hi>defective,</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> us from God, but the greatest evill proceeds from this, that our <hi>nature</hi> is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> and tyrannicall <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,</hi> as long as we <hi>live</hi> upon <hi>earth;</hi> it is subject to the <hi>curse</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> as being the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> a cursed rebellious <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> wholly opposite to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> What therefore proceeds from so <hi>bad</hi> a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which of itself can produce no good, is not onely to be suspected such, but, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>quality</hi> of its <hi>fountain,</hi> separates us from God, so that those who follow the <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> of the flesh, are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> divided from God.<note place="margin">Rom 8.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Those that are in the flesh,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, cannot please God,</hi> and doubtless, the more they follow their own <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> the more they are separated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Christian</hi> therefore who would be <hi>perfect,</hi> and begins to <hi>live</hi> in the exercises of <hi>true Christian piety,</hi> must <hi>oppose and annihilate</hi> his <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> or at least not follow them, for they are the <hi>inclinations</hi> of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:29616:263"/>
the man <hi>Adam,</hi> but must comply with the <hi>inclinations</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, resign himself to his <hi>divine conduct,</hi> who rules us by his <hi>providence,</hi> assists us with his <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> in us by his <hi>spirit.</hi> Where, the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against this <hi>danger,</hi> is to preserve our selves in an <hi>adherence</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who by the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>spirit,</hi> can suppress the tyranny of <hi>sin,</hi> and preserve us from the <hi>dominion</hi> it usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over us, as over a <hi>nature</hi> it hath a right unto. Hence the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> call the <hi>Son</hi> of God, him, that easily taketh off the yoke of sin; he alone by his <hi>grace,</hi> fortifies our <hi>souls,</hi> making them able to resist, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged therein, the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from its <hi>violence.</hi> By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, how much it concerns those who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise themselves in <hi>true Christian actions,</hi> to acquire <hi>solid piety,</hi> that they may depend on and adhere to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> seeing that if they do not, they are the <hi>slaves</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and chain'd to their own <hi>inclinations,</hi> which separate them from God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> of our <hi>enemies</hi> is the <hi>World</hi> which conspires our <hi>ruine,</hi> and, by the hate it beares to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> continually endeavours to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> us from him, either <hi>deceiving</hi> us by its <hi>allurements,</hi> or <hi>discouraging</hi> us by <hi>derision</hi> and <hi>opposition,</hi> or forcing us from our <hi>duties</hi> by

               </p>
               <p>When we speak of the <hi>World,</hi> we include all the <hi>creatures</hi> whereof it consists; they all <hi>separate</hi> us from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> not onely by the <hi>ill use</hi> we may make of them, but in some

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of temptations, and the advantages a Christian ought to make of them.</head>
               <p>THE first <hi>advice</hi> to be given in this <hi>point</hi> is, not to be <hi>over-confident</hi> of our selves, but to believe that we may be easily <hi>tempted;</hi> while we are <hi>mortall</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>tyranny</hi> of <hi>concupiscence,</hi> we shall alwayes have something to fight with. There are a many who think they are in no danger of <hi>temptation,</hi> who yet are very deep in it; for either they are <hi>guided</hi> by their own <hi>naturall inclinations</hi> and <hi>motions,</hi> and yet believe they do nothing but by the <hi>motions</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:29616:268"/>
of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>self-love,</hi> and <hi>perswaded</hi> they are <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or haply, are deceived by <hi>false apprehensions,</hi> thinking themselves well advanced in the <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>truths of God.</hi> These are great <hi>temptations</hi> which yet have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of solid <hi>vertue,</hi> when indeed the <hi>estate</hi> of such is very dangerous.</p>
               <p>The greatest part of <hi>Christians</hi> think <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> free from <hi>temptations,</hi> when they feel not the <hi>violence</hi> of them; it is not that they are not <hi>tempted,</hi> but the <hi>temptation</hi> hath feiz'd on them, and <hi>raigns</hi> in them. Whence they say they are in peace when they are most <hi>tyranniz'd</hi> over, and most <hi>enslaved</hi> by <hi>temptation</hi>; the evill is the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the lesse it is <hi>known.</hi> For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we say, the <hi>Christian</hi> must alwayes take heed to himself in <hi>temptation,</hi> and easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that he may the better stand upon his <hi>guard,</hi> for our <hi>nature</hi> is <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>infirm,</hi> our <hi>inclinations</hi> stray from <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> is opposite to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and our enemies <hi>subtil</hi> and <hi>powerfull,</hi> watching al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for our <hi>ruine.</hi> This <hi>consideration</hi> should not perplex us, but keep us in <hi>humility</hi> and continuall <hi>vigilancy.</hi> The <hi>sight</hi> of the <hi>danger</hi> wherein we are should cause us every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cry out and require help of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>protector</hi> and <hi>refuge</hi> in <hi>tribulations</hi>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:29616:269"/>
and <hi>anguishes</hi> of <hi>soul.</hi> When we find our <hi>selves</hi> in <hi>temptations,</hi> we are presently <hi>obliged</hi> to get out of them; it is not sufficient not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereto, and to be willing to submit to the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>evill spirit:</hi> but we should endeavour to <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>temptation</hi> as far as we can, if it arise from within us, and issue from our own <hi>nature,</hi> we must curb it as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> 
                  <hi>I keep under my body</hi> saith he, <hi>and bring it into subjection.</hi> For in such <hi>temptations</hi> which must often make use of <hi>fasting, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prayers</hi> and <hi>austerities,</hi> we must oppose our selves, fight against our <hi>inclinations,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy our evill <hi>habits,</hi> curb our <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> forcing them from all <hi>objects</hi> as much as possible. In brief, we must use <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> against our selves, delicacies are indeed the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>self-love,</hi> and the fuel of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> If we would free our selves from <hi>temptation,</hi> we must take away the <hi>cause,</hi> for when there is a <hi>correspondence</hi> between our <hi>nature</hi> and our <hi>enemies,</hi> our <hi>souls</hi> will at last be yielded up unto them.</p>
               <p>Let men commend these <hi>serenities</hi> of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> as they will, and <hi>preach</hi> up the <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet if it be true that <hi>vertue</hi> must be bought, that we must <hi>crucifie</hi> the <hi>old</hi> man, and <hi>destroy</hi> him, not <hi>sooth</hi> and <hi>cherish</hi> him; if according to <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>humane Lawes,</hi>

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:29616:269"/>
                  <hi>fight</hi>; if <hi>wrastlers,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, to gain a transitory <hi>honour,</hi> and fading <hi>crown,</hi> deprive themselves, and <hi>abstain</hi> from all things, what we do, who (<hi>as Christians</hi>) hope for a <hi>crown</hi> must of <hi>glory</hi> &amp; <hi>immortality?</hi> We must <hi>fight, oppose,</hi> and <hi>subdue</hi> our selves, if we will <hi>triumph</hi> over <hi>temptation</hi> which is bred in us. But if the <hi>temptation</hi> be from the <hi>Devil,</hi> we must then <hi>oppose</hi> it the more <hi>couragiously</hi> with a <hi>Christian generosity.</hi> For if he find us <hi>remiss,</hi> he will strike home, &amp; overcome us. To a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> confident <hi>soul,</hi> he is no more then a <hi>Fly,</hi> to a <hi>feeble</hi> and <hi>cowardly,</hi> fierce as a <hi>Lion. Resist the Devil,</hi>

               <p>As to <hi>discover,</hi> so to <hi>vanquish</hi> and <hi>destroy temptations,</hi> we must <hi>live</hi> in <hi>great humility,</hi> and above all, take heed we trust not too much to our own <hi>courage,</hi> or good <hi>resolutions</hi>; on the contrary, we must <hi>distrust</hi> our selves, and <hi>confide</hi> only in <hi>God;</hi> for we should be overcome in any (ever so small) <hi>temptation,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>grace,</hi> did not <hi>assist</hi> us, if he gave us not his <hi>light,</hi> we should not so much as know them.<note place="margin">Mat. 8.24.</note> Wherefore we must always say with the <hi>Disciples, Save us, O Lord, or we perish.</hi> We must often call upon the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and the <hi>grace</hi> of his <hi>mysteries,</hi> to give us <hi>strength</hi> in our <hi>weakness,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> in the <hi>darkness</hi> of our <hi>spirit,</hi> who was <hi>himself tempted,</hi> that he might overcome us, that in the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi>

                  <hi>that ye may resist in the evil day.</hi> It belongs to the <hi>Son</hi> of God to give us the <hi>armour,</hi> that is, to give us <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> to resist. To obtain this <hi>favour,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> particularly recommends <hi>Prayer</hi> to us, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pray alwayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>with all prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, in the spirit, and watch with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance.</hi> These words are to shew with what <hi>importunity, devotion</hi> and <hi>fervour</hi> we are to <hi>pray.</hi> And truly we have need, when the <hi>perills</hi> are so <hi>great,</hi> our <hi>enemies</hi> so <hi>powerfull,</hi> and our <hi>forces</hi> so <hi>small.</hi> In the time of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it is not requisite to <hi>fight</hi> hand to hand, much less to <hi>dispute</hi> with it, to <hi>reason</hi> with, or <hi>examine</hi> it, or to <hi>force</hi> it away by <hi>violence</hi>; this were to <hi>attribute</hi> too much to <hi>our selves;</hi> for many times to <hi>examine</hi> it, is to <hi>entertain</hi> it, and to strive to <hi>oppose</hi> it too <hi>neerly,</hi> is to <hi>become fastened</hi> to it; and by <hi>disputing</hi> with it, we are overcome. It is more to purpose, that as soon as we see the <hi>temptation,</hi> we turn our thought some other way, and look upon it with <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>derision.</hi> We must neither hearken to the <hi>Devil,</hi> nor speak to him; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing puts him into greater <hi>fury,</hi> then to see himself <hi>slighted;</hi> nothing <hi>pleases</hi> him more,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:29616:270"/>
then to <hi>heed</hi> and <hi>regard</hi> him, for so we give him <hi>access,</hi> and in a manner, <hi>enter</hi> into <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> with him. This is one of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>subtilties</hi> whereby he <hi>deceives</hi> even the most <hi>wary,</hi> yet we take no <hi>heed</hi> of it. The <hi>devils intention</hi> in all this, is to <hi>amuse</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain</hi> us; the <hi>objects</hi> he lays before us, are not always <hi>evil</hi>; it is <hi>sufficient</hi> for him, if he but see us <hi>hearken</hi> to him, that he may by little and little <hi>enter</hi> into <hi>discourse</hi> with us, which once done, he will soon <hi>instill</hi> his <hi>poyson</hi> into us. Which way sover it is, his <hi>drift</hi> is to <hi>turn</hi> us from God, that he may have the <hi>disposall</hi> of our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>spirits;</hi> that is enough to <hi>deceive</hi> even those who make <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>solid piety,</hi> and much <hi>faithfulness</hi> in the ways of God. It is no small <hi>evil</hi> to <hi>turn</hi> away from <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>regard</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> a <hi>suggestion</hi> and <hi>conference,</hi> that the <hi>devil</hi> would have with our <hi>spirits,</hi> although we should do it to a <hi>good end,</hi> with an <hi>intent</hi> to <hi>drive</hi> him away. For it is to <hi>heed</hi> the <hi>devil,</hi> to <hi>hearken</hi> to him, and by a strict <hi>examination</hi> of his <hi>suggestions,</hi> to <hi>conferre</hi> with him; it is to <hi>withdraw</hi> our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> from God, to <hi>employ</hi> them in what the <hi>devil</hi> proposes.</p>
               <p>To avoyd all these <hi>impurities,</hi> and to keep our selves from <hi>danger,</hi> we must bear the <hi>temptation</hi> without <hi>enclining</hi> to it; we must <hi>spit</hi> at the <hi>devil, slight</hi> all his <hi>assaults,</hi> and
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:29616:271"/>
above all, <hi>withdraw</hi> our <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> from all he <hi>proposes.</hi> This is the <hi>shortest</hi> and most <hi>easie</hi> way in all kinds of <hi>temptations</hi>; For we shall find, that <hi>temptations stay</hi> in us, because we <hi>entertain</hi> them under <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>driving</hi> them away, and <hi>examining</hi> them; It is enough we be <hi>watchfull,</hi> and as soon as we have <hi>discovered</hi> the <hi>temptation</hi> or <hi>suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>devil,</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> it. But there are some <hi>temptations</hi> that arise from <hi>objects</hi> or <hi>occasions,</hi> in which case we must onely avoyd them, and from all that may <hi>divide</hi> us from God. There are others that are <hi>urgent,</hi> and make <hi>lively impressions</hi> upon our <hi>spirits,</hi> upon divers <hi>matters,</hi> which would be long to <hi>explain.</hi> In these cases we must not <hi>regard</hi> the <hi>temptation,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> in it, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, when he was most <hi>tempted,</hi> and <hi>afflicted: The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away</hi>;<note place="margin">Job 1.21.</note> so we, when <hi>pressed,</hi> must <hi>cast</hi> our selves at the <hi>feet</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> our selves to him, that he may <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> the <hi>temptation</hi> in us, if it be for his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or keep us from <hi>consenting</hi> thereto. We must <hi>implore</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> for there are such <hi>pressing temptatirns</hi> that there is need of the greatest <hi>mercy</hi> of God to <hi>deliver</hi> us from them. We must therefore cry out with <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and, as much as we can, <hi>enter</hi> into some <hi>conference</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of <hi>spirit</hi> with

the <hi>Son</hi> of God, acording to the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> of our <hi>soul.</hi>

recommended to the <hi>Christian</hi> who would be <hi>saved</hi> from the <hi>subtilties</hi> of the Devill, that he be alwayes in <hi>fear,</hi> a filial <hi>fear,</hi> and that in the <hi>temptation</hi> it self, in his greatest <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>resignation</hi> he hides himself in his <hi>nothing,</hi> and keep himself in a profound <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> for that is the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> Buckler <hi>to quench</hi> as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> sayes,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.16.</note>

The most <hi>perfect</hi> will never do so, they having given up themselves wholly to <hi>God's divine conduct,</hi> will here also <hi>leave</hi> themselves in the <hi>hands</hi> of God; without saying any thing, for they think of nothing but <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> seeing it is Gods pleasure and their practise, to <hi>annihilate</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> themselves, being assured he will never forsake those that are his in <hi>temptation.</hi> The <hi>devout Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> who walks steadfastly in the way of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> seeks no <hi>support</hi> or <hi>repose</hi> in any thing, or troubles himself about it, or omitteth the least of his <hi>exercises,</hi> or looseth the <hi>peace</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> or <hi>serenity</hi> of his <hi>look.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is <hi>animated</hi> in this <hi>combate,</hi> he defies his <hi>enemie,</hi> and derides him and all his <hi>works,</hi> addressing himself wholly to God who is his

                  <hi>love</hi> and <hi>trust.</hi> He renders him <hi>thanks,</hi> and absolutely <hi>resignes</hi> himself up to him, to bear as long as, and in what manner he pleases the <hi>temptation</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> he is in. There is a way to make a further <hi>progress</hi> in this <hi>estate.</hi> Some <hi>souls</hi> there are (which will haply seem <hi>incredible</hi>) who have neither <hi>desire</hi> nor <hi>thought</hi> of imploring Gods <hi>assistance,</hi> not but that they know the <hi>need</hi> they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but they are so <hi>devoted</hi> to God, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>resigned</hi> to his <hi>divine will,</hi> that if God would <hi>destroy</hi> them, they would be <hi>content,</hi> so great a <hi>thirst</hi> have they for the <hi>glory</hi> of God, so great a <hi>desire</hi> to <hi>suffer,</hi> that they are so far from <hi>receiving,</hi> that they do not so much as think of demanding help, their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> being barely and simply in <hi>God.</hi> Besides they know the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>infallibility</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> faithful in his <hi>promises,</hi> never forsaking those that are his. By this <hi>truth</hi> they are <hi>possessed</hi> and <hi>excited.</hi> On the other side, they so <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>absolutely</hi> resign themselves to the will of <hi>God,</hi> that they never mind whether they <hi>suffer</hi> or are in <hi>danger,</hi> it is enough for them that they do nothing to <hi>displease</hi> God, and know that they are Gods, and God wholly theirs.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>resignation</hi> is onely in some few; we will not say, but it is <hi>permitted</hi> sometimes to <hi>demand</hi> help of God and man, not to be
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:29616:274"/>
absolutely freed, (that were haply to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>designes</hi> of God) but for <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> in <hi>Temptation.</hi> For example. If a <hi>Christian</hi> through want of <hi>light, courage</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> find himself <hi>fail,</hi> it will be very requisite that he speak with his <hi>director,</hi> demanding his advice in an <hi>Affaire</hi> of so great <hi>consequence,</hi> and so much danger. In these anguishes he must <hi>elevate</hi> his heart to God, <hi>call</hi> upon him, and <hi>earnestly</hi> implore his <hi>assistance</hi>; this is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is <hi>necessary,</hi> so it be with this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> that the will of God be accomplished in him, and his <hi>good pleasure</hi> fulfilled, and that his recourse to God be not forced by any secret <hi>impatience,</hi> or <hi>irresignation</hi> of his <hi>soul.</hi> In that case it were to <hi>yield</hi> to the <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to <hi>commit an extraordinary impurity,</hi> and <hi>prejudiciall infidelity.</hi> But to run unto God to demand <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> with <hi>resignation</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> is that which is promised to all <hi>Christians.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Divers <hi>Uses</hi> that may be made of <hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE must observe well what hath been said upon this <hi>occasion.</hi> The <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> who would <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>true piety,</hi> must greatly <hi>esteem</hi> this way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> and <hi>temptation,</hi> for it is noble, and <hi>works</hi> great <hi>effects</hi> in the <hi>soul,</hi> which she may meet with in all the <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>humane life,</hi> since in all we are to <hi>fight</hi> against the <hi>imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, failings, impurities</hi> and <hi>malignities,</hi> which secretly insinuate themselves into her. But we must chiefly <hi>esteem</hi> thereof, because the <hi>Son</hi> of God hath great <hi>designes</hi> upon our <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>operates</hi> great things in them by these wayes of <hi>temptation, desertions,</hi> and <hi>resignations.</hi> Wherefore it concerns us to know how to make <hi>use</hi> thereof, that we <hi>cooperate</hi> with the <hi>designes</hi> of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Cum tentatione proventum.</hi> For the <hi>Son</hi> of God, who is <hi>faithfull,</hi> and <hi>permits</hi> us not to be <hi>tempted</hi> beyond our <hi>strength,</hi> gives ordinarily with the <hi>temptation,</hi> particular <hi>graces,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himself, though in a hidden manner, yet truly to the <hi>soul</hi> that receives
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:29616:275"/>
them as she ought, it being most <hi>certain,</hi> that in the wayes of <hi>piety,</hi> God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates himself, more ordinarily by these then any other wayes, as we formerly said when we treated of <hi>sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief <hi>use</hi> we are to make of <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> is to receive it, and look on it as the <hi>conduct</hi> of God over us; we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it with a <hi>profound humility,</hi> with a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> of <hi>soul,</hi> upon the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of God in the <hi>temptation</hi> it self. I say, with <hi>humility,</hi> because the <hi>soul</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>true Devotion,</hi> must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire throughly to be <hi>humbled,</hi> and embrace with readiness of <hi>spirit,</hi> all the wayes of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and all the <hi>occasions</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves therein. It is a <hi>maxime</hi> in all <hi>estates</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> that the <hi>principall</hi> use we are to make of all the wayes of <hi>God</hi> over us, is <hi>humility,</hi> and therefore, as <hi>temptation</hi> is a way of God, a way of <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> so must we <hi>humble</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> much therein, the more we are <hi>tempted</hi> and <hi>abandoned</hi>; For, in <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> the best and most profitable <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that we can be in, is to <hi>annihilate</hi> our selves before God; and like <hi>Iob,</hi> place our selves, if it be requisite, upon a <hi>dung-hill,</hi> to attend and receive what <hi>punishment</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the hand of God shall vouchsafe to
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:29616:275"/>
                  <hi>inflict</hi> upon us. Is it not <hi>reason</hi> it should be so? If God be so pleased, as to <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate</hi> us by <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>temptations,</hi> what have we to say against it? To what purpose so much <hi>fear,</hi> so much <hi>reluctancy?</hi> If God will <hi>punish</hi> us in this <hi>fire,</hi> we must hold our selves content; if he will <hi>humble</hi> us, we must <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate</hi> our selves; if by <hi>temptation</hi> he will use his <hi>justice,</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> us, why should we be troubled thereat? Yea, though he should leave us to be <hi>swallowed</hi> up by the <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which can <hi>never fall</hi> out but through <hi>our</hi> own fault) let us accept of his <hi>judgments,</hi> and adore his <hi>justice,</hi> saying with <hi>Eli,</hi> when he heard from the mouth of little <hi>Samuel,</hi> the <hi>decree</hi> of Gods <hi>justice</hi> against him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus est, quod bonus est in oculis suis faciat.</hi> Let us say the same, let us receive all from the <hi>hand</hi> of God, with great <hi>humility.</hi> This is the <hi>first use</hi> we are to make of <hi>temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another is, to receive it with <hi>subjection</hi> of <hi>soul</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of God. <hi>Temptation</hi> is the <hi>conduct</hi> of God over us. We must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider him that <hi>tempteth</hi> us, nor yet the <hi>temptation</hi> we groan under, but the <hi>order</hi> of God, and the <hi>designs</hi> he hath upon us in that <hi>temptation.</hi> Nothing can happen to us, but by his <hi>permission,</hi> though the <hi>Devil</hi> make it his constant <hi>business,</hi> to <hi>hurt, molest,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi> us, if he could, yet he hath no <hi>power</hi> but
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:29616:276"/>
what he receives from God, all his <hi>power</hi> is limited. We must not therefore <hi>regard</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> that <hi>tempteth</hi> us, nor the <hi>temptation</hi> or <hi>malice</hi> of our <hi>enemies,</hi> but the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of God in the <hi>temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To comprehend this well, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>temptation,</hi> is not onely a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of God, but one of his ordinary ways of proceeding over us, to <hi>conduct</hi> us to him. Whence it followes, that it is not enough to <hi>suffer,</hi> and to <hi>submit</hi> to <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but we must do it <hi>purely,</hi> and <hi>holily.</hi> For seeing <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> are the ordinary ways of God to <hi>conduct</hi> us to him, we must not in <hi>temptation</hi> make any <hi>pause,</hi> or <hi>think</hi> it <hi>sufficient</hi> to bear them <hi>patiently,</hi> or to <hi>fight</hi> against them, but we must pass further, and go even to <hi>God,</hi> to whom they will <hi>conduct</hi> us, if we make such use of them as we ought. Thus in <hi>temptation,</hi> we must rather <hi>regard</hi> God then the <hi>temptation,</hi> that <hi>binds</hi> us to God. It is true, we may <hi>fear</hi> to be <hi>overcome,</hi> but if we be <hi>left</hi> to God, he will not <hi>fail</hi> us in our <hi>necessity</hi>; he promised to be with us in our <hi>agonies</hi> and <hi>temptations.</hi> Let us be but <hi>faithfull</hi> in our <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and without doubt, he will be <hi>faithfull</hi> in his <hi>promises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>third</hi> use of <hi>temptations,</hi> is, to refer them to the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>offer</hi> to him the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:29616:276"/>
                  <hi>state</hi> that we bear, and all that passeth in us. This is grounded both upon our <hi>duties,</hi> and the <hi>designes</hi> of God, who wills, that we <hi>referr</hi> to him all the <hi>estates</hi> of our <hi>soul,</hi> and all the <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>moments</hi> of our <hi>life,</hi> that is, all that is in us, and all that we are. This use is also <hi>grounded</hi> on the <hi>condition</hi> of all things which are opposite to <hi>honour,</hi> and pay <hi>homage</hi> to God, but principally, the <hi>Christian,</hi> who is called to the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> only to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> God; and particularly, such as make <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>piety</hi>; since <hi>true devotion</hi> requires much <hi>fidelity,</hi> and wills us to make use of all things to <hi>unite</hi> us to God, and to <hi>render</hi> to him the <hi>honours</hi> and <hi>homages</hi> due to his <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>supreme Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we <hi>reflect</hi> upon all that hath been said from the <hi>beginning</hi> to this <hi>instant,</hi> we shall see that we <hi>end</hi> where we <hi>began,</hi> and that we have done nothing, but shewn the <hi>Christian,</hi> who would be <hi>perfect,</hi> that <hi>true piety</hi> consists in <hi>purifying</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> and making it worthy to <hi>bear</hi> and <hi>possess</hi> God; that he is <hi>truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,</hi> who <hi>lives</hi> according to the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>; that to arrive at this <hi>happiness,</hi> we must <hi>adhere</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> our <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> to bring us to <hi>God;</hi> that the <hi>principall care</hi> we ought to have in these <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi> is, to <hi>preserve</hi> our selves therein, which, indeed, brings us to an <hi>adherence</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:29616:277"/>
of God, and to <hi>live</hi> with great <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>vigilancy,</hi> subject to the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and <hi>dependant</hi> upon his <hi>holy Ordinances.</hi> These are the <hi>foundations</hi> we must lay, if we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>true piety;</hi> and when we come to the <hi>Consideration</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and to express the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worship, love,</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> which we would <hi>render</hi> to God, we have said, that it is not enough to do <hi>good things,</hi> but we must accomplish them by the <hi>conduct</hi> of his <hi>holy spirit,</hi> according to his <hi>intentions,</hi> and in <hi>holy dispositions.</hi> We have already proposed the <hi>method</hi>; it suffices to know, that therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> for which we <hi>render</hi> to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>service</hi> due to him. This is all we mean to shew in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> which we will conclude with the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul, The God of peace make you perfect in every good work,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.20.21.</note>
