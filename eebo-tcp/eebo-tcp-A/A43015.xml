            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Distinction III. Signes of the Plague.</head>
               <p>THe highest pitch or degrees of Malignity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion accompanying a Feaver, are the essential
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49507:3"/>
properties, that distinguish the Plague from all other Diseases; so that where we find a Feaver is most Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign and most Contagious, there we are not to doubt of the birth of a Plague.</p>
               <p>That the said Pestilence is a most Malign and Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Feaver, is evidenced by these signatures; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that superlative degree of Malignity is known by an universal Lassitude, or Subitous soreness of all ones Limbs, as if bruised or beaten; sometimes a <hi>Diary</hi> Feaver, but immediatly changing into a putrid, and that soon after into a most Malign Feaver; or a Putrid Feaver at first, suddenly accrescing to a most <hi>Malign</hi> or <hi>Pestilent</hi> Feaver; or a most Malign Feaver at the first attaque, a great burning heat within and without, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the heat is moderate or scarce sensible without, but within melting and burning; other times the heat is not very intense either without or within, continual vigilies, or a perpetual restlesness, with anguishing jactitations, or throwing ones self from one part of the bed to the other; a raging pain of the Head, a sudden and raving Phrensie; a loss of appetite, with a loathing of all Victuals, an insatiable drought, frequent and anguishing Vomitings; a Dysentery or griping Loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in some, in others a Costiveness. The Pulses beat according to the nature of the Pestilence, <hi>viz.</hi> in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent Diary great and quick; in a putrid Pest inequal in motion and strength, but quick; in a Malign Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Feaver, thick, low; languid, inequal in motion and strength, quavering and intercident. The Urine varies likewise accordingly: and observe that both Urine and Pulses are very fallacious in Pestilentials, many expiring after strong Pulses and good Urines. Spots and Blotches of several colours and figures stragling over the Body;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49507:4"/>
some are red like fleabits, but livid about; others yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, livid, or black. A pricking of the intire skin, as if stung with Nettles: Risings like blisters, or small tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and pushes, some red, others yellow or blackish: Carbuncles, or red, purple or blackish Boyls or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations about the groin, under the ears or armpits, which if they break, contain a black crust or coal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them.</p>
               <p>The single presence of these Signs are no certain Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks or Determinations of a Plague, unless the said Feaver prove Infectious, as two or three dying in one house, or several in a Neighbourhood, of one and the same kind of Feaver, is no small argument.</p>

               <head>Distinction IV. Causes of a Pestilent Feaver or Plague.</head>
               <p>DIseases are caused through some innate, or adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious weakness of the Intrails; or vitiate qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and effect of some or all the <hi>Non-naturals, viz.</hi> victuals and drink, air, passions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by reason of some external errors, or intemperance, or ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the use of the said <hi>Non-naturals</hi>; or mischances, as falls, poysons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first sort of these Causes evades all suspicion, since strong Bodies and the best Complexions are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exposed to the said Contagion with the worst. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the second accusable, most persons varying in the use and election of all the <hi>Non-naturals,</hi> except the air, which all Inhabitants of a City or Country seeming to inspire alike or in common, must likewise be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of a common Disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49507:4"/>The air to be capable of engendring a venomous and malign Disease, must be first venenated or rendred poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous it self, for if distemper'd only generates no other than hot or cold, dry or moist Distempers: But 1. What this venom is? 2. Where out? 3. Through what? 4. Whence this venenosity in the air arrives? are intricate Queries, that merit studious Solutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is this Pestilential venom?</hi> Pestilential sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms declare nothing a proportionate efficient of their effrajable and miscreant nature, but <hi>Arsenical fumes,</hi> which imitating the nature of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> result into a most pernicious poyson; for <hi>Arsenick</hi> ingested within the Body in a course thick substance, immediatly effects enormous Vomits, Dysenteries, burning Feavers, raging Headaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much more such subtil <hi>Arsenical fumes,</hi> that aggress the Body from all parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where or in what place are the said Arsenical fumes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated?</hi> The Earth can only be supposed the Womb of such venene fumes, which imbibing all sorts of stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or putrid Bodies, embraces them within her close recesses, coagulates and kindles them into Pestilential Arsenical flames; so that all manner of stinks or rotten Bodies expiring into the air, are returned by moderate Rains, and so suckt in by the Earth; likewise all filth and dirt thrown into standing Waters, Pools, Sinks, Gutters, or Ditches, are also imbibed by the Earth, or by its clammy mud, and there coagulated into venene Miasms. Whence its apparent that nastiness and filth of Kitchins, and several nasty Trades, as Tallow-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlers, Butchers, Poulterers, Fishmongers, Dyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neglect of cleansing Gutters, Sinks or Ditches, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng the Streets, burying the dead, removing Carrions and dead Carcases, are great occasions of a Plague.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49507:5"/>
Further observe, that to the production of Pestilential atoms, the concurrence of these conditions is requisite: 1. That those Pestilential fumes be first embryonately or preparatively formed in a close thick or standing air, (that is not much ventilated) and close places, <hi>viz.</hi> by harbouring great quantities of stinks and corruptions, and returning them to the earth or mud of standing Waters, Ditches, Gutters, or dirt of the streets, to be coagulated into venene fumes, which stinks participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a sulphurous inflamable nature, do soon kindle and are converted into flaming atoms, by being coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in close places, as the pores of the earth or mud. 2. A want of great showers of Rain, which otherwise would prevent a Pestilence, by washing away all stinks and mud, clear the Gutters and Sinks, cool the Earth, and extinguish those late concepted venoms. 3. Small Rains to open the pores of the Earth, and to conveigh those corruptions in the air into her bosom. 4. A dry and hot season following the moist, whereby the mud of the earth is seared up, and the foresaid malign coagulations are kindled into flaming atoms. 5. The said Arsenical bodies being now coagulated and kindled into flaming atoms, require either a very dry and warm, or subtiliating air, to melt and open the surface of the Earth, for to disincarcerate the said venene bodies, or to attract and evocate them thence: Or smal Rains to unglue and relax the earth to give vent to the inflamed atoms. 6. These expiring require a thick and dull air to support, preserve and feed them, otherwise if subtil and thin, they would soon be amortised, dissolved, or expelled by the thin quick and moveable air.</p>
               <p>But since Plagues oft reign in places where the air seems cleer, and freed from all stinks or corruptions, its
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49507:5"/>
an argument, there must be some other sort of pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Mineral arsenical fumes, engendred within the bowels of the Earth; for its probable, the Earth being an universal Parent of various mixt bodies, as Vegetables, Stones, and Minerals, must necessarily abound with excrements, that are sequestred from all those Bodies she concocts, and remain unapt of being converted into them, which she expels to the surface, and thence into the air; But if it happens the Pores of the surface should be constipated, and occasion a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural retention of the said excrements, probably the more sulphurous parts of them do putrefie and inflame, in the same manner of retained excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours within the Microcosm, and so assume a venene nature, which expiring infect and venenate the air. The Earth may also happen to be constipated upon great Frosts, and so we see many Plagues derive their original from a rude Winter, or by great Rains converting her surface into a tough thick mud.</p>

               <p>THe said flaming Arsenical corpuscles floating in the air, are attracted into the Body, by Inspiration through the Lungs and Nostrils; or otherwise they pierce through ones clothes, and so penetrate into the pores of the intire Body. The said <hi>Miasms</hi> entring the Body are not so Energick as to venenate the intire mass of blood in an instant, (for in that case no preservatives would avail, and any Person that had but inspired the least breath of contagious air would be struck with death

               <p>THis Contagion might have been presaged upon consideration of its precursors, <hi>viz.</hi> a rude Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, want of great showers of rain, a thick, close, sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous, and fiery air, stinks of ditches, and neglect of cleansing the gutters, sinks, and paring the streets. Whence we may collect, this Pestilence derives from expiring Mineral and adventitious Arsenical exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The differences of Plagues are specified by the degree, qualification, or <hi>modus substantiae</hi> of the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Seminaries, which according to their grosseness or subtility, activity, or hebetude, cause more or less trucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent plagues, some partaking of such a pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of malignity, that in the manner of a most presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous poyson, they enecate in two or three hours, suddenly corrupting or extinguishing the vital spirits; others at their first appulse excite a <hi>Per-per-acute</hi> malign Feaver; and some begin with a putrid feaver, swiftly changing into a malign one, which nature this present Pest seems to have assumed, gradually encroaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as we have already expressed.</p>
               <p>The Pestilence, in respect of its Seminaries, peragrates the four ordinary times: to wit, first, the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when those fiery Miasms are but newly kindled, and begin to expire into the air, and but few dye. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The <hi>Augment,</hi> when the said pestilent exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exhale in greater quantities, and kindle other Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries in the air. Thirdly, The <hi>state,</hi> when they burst out in a full stream, and have kindled most part of the

               <head>Distinction XII. The Preservative Cure.</head>
               <p>THe Preservative part seems the best, easiest, and surest cure of the Plague, for if once attaqued, it is great odds whether you escape, and therefore shall principally encline my endeavours to propose the best and most certain Preservatives.</p>
               <p>We have illustrated to you, this Plague works upon us gradually by vitiating and corrupting our humours through the malign air, against which we are to preserve our bodies and humours in their natural state, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our selves against the injuries of the air.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our bodies and humours are best preserved by feeding moderately upon meats of easie digesture, and of a dry temperature, as Mutton, Veal, Hens, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but dry roasted. By being temperate in drink, avoiding French Wines, Sack, Strong Alc, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially musty Beer. <hi>Coffee</hi> is commended against the Contagion; likewise moderate exercise; be sure to prevent costiveness, and violent passions; Sleep mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and after you are up uncover your bed, and open the curtains to air it, and have the bed well shaken when it is made; for damps are very dangerous.</p>
               <p>Abstain from all moist victuals, as fish, and moist fruits, especially from Cowcumbers, Lettuce, Spinnage, Plumbs, Peaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oranges and Lemmons are judged very good against Infection; likewise Vinegar.</p>
               <p>To go forth with an empty or hungry stomach is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom, because the spirits tending from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49507:8"/>
to the stomach and intrails to attract nutriment, their deserted vacuities in the extremities are filled up with the infectious air.</p>
               <p>The best breakfast against the Contagion is Bisquit and Raisins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Plethory or abundance of bloud oppressing the spirits, that are already engaged by the malign air, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning them from without, is very apt to putrefie, and to be converted into malignity: and therefore <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> or opening a vein is of absolute necessity, whereby the vessels are rendred more loose and free for the spirits to work in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Likewise foulness of body, or excrementitious humours lodging in hidden recesses, being disposed to putrefaction, and oppressing the spirits, ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely purged away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These internal disorders or apparent intestine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilities being thus prevented, you are to provide against the injuries of the venene air, which assaults us two waies: 1. Through the nostrils and lungs by Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Through the pores of the body, especially where the skin is thinnest, and the Arteries most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, (for the vital spirits seem to attract the air po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently through the Arteries,) as about the wrists, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Jugulars, groin, and under the arm pits. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicata</hi> relating to those <hi>Indicantia</hi> are: 1. Perfumes to smell to, correcting and purifying the air before it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Lungs, or rather antipestilential unguents and oyls to annoint the nostrils with; for it is tedious to be alwaies obliged to hold a perfume to ones nose; besides, I observe most people that carry those perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med boxes about with them, imagine them sufficient preservatories, as if the Infection were only taken by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49507:9"/>
inspiration through the Nostrils; but that is a great mistake, since the Contagion doth more ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penetrate into the body through the pores of the Arteries. 2. <hi>Lavatories</hi> to wash the temples, hands, wrists, and Jugulars, do potently profligate and keep off the venome: But I should rather advise Antipesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Emplasters to be applied to the wrists, temples, groin, and arm-pits, which is a most excellent and commodious way of preserving, because those <hi>Lavato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are easily dried up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since it is impossible, that those that are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with a pestilential air can so preserve themselves, but at one time or other the Contagion will enter into this or that part, it is advisable we should continually fortifie our spirits with internal <hi>Antidotes,</hi> to expell those Venenosities, as fast as they croud in. The <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes</hi> ought to be so qualified as in a single Doss to retain the bloud in a continual mild fermentation for 24 hours, (known by a small glowing of the body and extremities,) whereby the insidiating corpuscles are expulsed, and the advenient ones kept off: and such are only gross <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks</hi> given in substance, that scarce exhale out of the body in less time than a natural day. Hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the vulgar vanity, reposing an indubious confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a spoonful or two of those ordinary Antipesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential spirits, (as that of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> the <hi>Lord Bacon, Mithridate, Treacle,</hi> and a thousand more, that are composed out of the same sudorifick ingredients) which because of their subtil parts and exiguous Dose, are consumed and evaporated in less than two hours time, and so the body is deserted without defence for the remainder of the day; besides they are apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the body, enrage the Gall, and engender
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49507:9"/>
pernicious humours. Neither, as we may universally observe, is the Plague more shie in attaquing those that are armed with the said Antipestilentials, than others that slight all Preservatives.</p>
               <p>But the greatest levity and imprudence is, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should so preposterously addict themselves to tipling of the fore-instanced spirits, which encountring with foul bodies, and Plethories, and exciting a fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those vitiate humours, must necessarily precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them into putrid and malign Feavers, especially where the air is so propitious for them. Moreover, they must also cause obstructions and constipations, by dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating and absorbing the subtiler parts of the fluors, and leaving the courser behind. Now, to evidence the necessity of <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> and <hi>Catharticks</hi>; the long rude Winter and cold Spring occasioning great appetites have extreamly provoked people to gourmandizing and debauchery, whence bodies result <hi>Plethorick,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymick,</hi> add thereunto the vitiate disposition of the air, sensibly contributing to the generation of depravate bloud; thus far touching the <hi>Indications.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. SHun all publick meetings, where people promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously conversing with one another, do readily propagate the infection: besides nothing subministrates apter matter to be converted into pestilent Seminaries than peoples steams and breaths, especially of nasty folks, as beggers, and others: whence those houses happen to be soonest infected, that are crouded with

dampness, as I have illustrated in my <hi>Philosophy,</hi> Part 2. Book 1. Chap. 24. Par. 5. is a great cause of the Plague.
