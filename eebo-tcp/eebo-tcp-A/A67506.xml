            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>SINCE a Poet, in a piece of Satyr, like a Passionate Man in a Skirmish, may by accident offend those he never designed to meddle with, the Author, lest People should think he has too far jested with an Edge-Tool, has thought fit to declare, that he had no other Intention in the following <hi>Poem,</hi> than to apply it as a Carpenter does his Axe, when, to the hazard of its Edge, he strikes at those stubborn and irregular Knots which are a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to the Tree, and lessen the value of the Timber: Or as a Surgeon handles his Lancet, when he lays open a corrupt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is both troublesome and scandalous to the sound parts of the Body. It is evident enough, there is no Church in the World but what has received some Blemishes from her Priests, meaning some few, who, for want of either Learning, Prudence, or Piety, have been a dishonour to their Function, such only I accuse; and I hope, should I blame <hi>Peter</hi> for denying his Master, or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> for betraying Him, the rest of the Apostles would have no reason to be angry. If I am condemn'd for Arraigning 'em in the Lower Regions, which some of 'em have good reason to hope was prepar'd only for us Laymen, I have only this to say, that I am not the first that has plac'd a vicious Clergyman in the Infernal Territories; for <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> the Famous <hi>Roman</hi> Painter, in his Resurrection in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chapel, had the presumption to paint a Cardinal in Hell, so very like the grave Father he represented, that every body knew the Picture, which put the good Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under so great a Dissatisfaction, that he complain'd to the Pope, and desir'd he would Command it should be rub'd out; who told him, he was got quite out of his Jurisdiction, saying, If he had been but a step on this side, he could have released him from Purgatory, but having not the Keys of Hell, from thence there could be no Redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59366:3"/>
The next part of my Apology, is to the Learned Professors both of Law and Physick, for whom (as well as the Orthodox Clergy of the <hi>English</hi> Church) I have a peculiar Veneration, who cannot be insensible what swarms of hungry and unskilful Practicers in both Sciences there are, who fraudulently prey upon the honest Labours of the Publick, at such only is this Satyr pointed, who support themselves basely by others Ruin, and have no just Prospect, for want of true Knowledge in their Business, to preserve themselves from Beggary, but by often bringing others into it; one side plunging their Clients further into Trouble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of helping them out; and the other, instead of recovering their Patients of Curable Distempers, will, if they be Poor, thro' neglect; or if Rich, by delays of Cure, for Interest sake, be the Death of some, and the undoing of others, to their whole Lives Misery. Therefore, since it as essentially relates to the Comforts of the Life of Man, to know what other People are, as well as what he himself should be, I thought it no Ill Task to Communicate to the World what knowledge of Mankind I have gather'd from my own Experience; the Good wont hurt us, 'tis the Bad we must be Cautious how we deal with; for which reason, I have herein separated the Wicked from the Godly, representing only the former, to show Youth what Monsters in Humane Shape they must expect to meet with in this World, tho' of the most Noble Professions: Therefore, my whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is only to make Men careful with what <hi>Priests</hi> they trust their Souls; with what <hi>Lawyers</hi> their Estates; and with what <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi> their Bodies. And if this Part of my Undertaking suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well, and that the World is pleased with it, they shall hear further from me on the same Subject; for in this I had not room to half finish my Design. <hi>So Farewel.</hi>

                     <lg>
                        <l>WHEN <hi>Western</hi> Clouds involv'd the God of Light,</l>
                        <l>And all the <hi>Eastern</hi> starry Orbs look'd bright;</l>
                        <l>When Sots their Tavern Bacchanals begun,</l>
                        <l>And <hi>Thetis</hi> at a draught drank up the Sun;</l>
                        <l>Whilst <hi>Luna</hi> with her Silver Horns drew near,</l>
                        <l>To bless the Night, and bear Dominion here.</l>
                        <l>'Twas then that I, my better self, my Soul</l>
                        <l>Broke loose, and thro' my Prison Casements stole,</l>
                        <l>And glad I'd shifted off my Earthly Chains,</l>
                        <l>Danc'd like a flaming Vapour round the Plains.</l>
                        <l>I then thro' Brakes and over Whirl-Pools flew,</l>
                        <l>Till tir'd with only superficial view;</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59366:4"/>
Then into Holes and Crannies did I dive,</l>
                        <l>Where Badger, Fox, and sundry Vermine live;</l>
                        <l>Where Moles were labouring to enlarge their Homes</l>
                        <l>And buzzing Bees made Musick o'er their Combs.</l>
                        <l>Farther I darted thro' the porous Earth,</l>
                        <l>To seek that Womb whence Nature had her Birth,</l>
                        <l>But found the hidden Mistery far too great,</l>
                        <l>And for a Human Soul too intricate:</l>
                        <l>Causes with sundry Causes mix'd I found,</l>
                        <l>Each Matrix did with proper Seeds abound,</l>
                        <l>But why those Seeds their likeness shou'd produce,</l>
                        <l>Their Form preserve, be still the same in use,</l>
                        <l>My shallow Reason neither see or knew,</l>
                        <l>But found each Cause did the Decrees pursue,</l>
                        <l>Of some Eternal Pow'r beyond dim Reasons view.</l>
                        <l>Thro' deeper Caverns still I forc'd my way,</l>
                        <l>Where useless Dregs of the old Chaos lay,</l>
                        <l>Involv'd in Night, remote, and never seen by Day.</l>
                        <l>Where Plagues and Pestilential Fumes were pent,</l>
                        <l>Till Heav'ns Decree shou'd give 'em fatal vent:</l>
                        <l>Where greater Serpents do the less devour,</l>
                        <l>And Human-like, contend for Sov'reign Pow'r:</l>
                        <l>Where Streams thro' subteranean Channels run,</l>
                        <l>And fight with Winds far distant from the Sun;</l>
                        <l>Whose violent Shocks the World can scarce survive,</l>
                        <l>But trembles at the very strokes they give.</l>
                        <l>And where Heavens Judgments in subjection lay,</l>
                        <l>Ready the dreadful Trumpet to Obey,</l>
                        <l>And work the World's destruction at the last sad Day.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59366:4"/>
Thus thro' Nights deep Avenues did I pass,</l>
                        <l>Where all was rude as in the unform'd Mass.</l>
                        <l>Thro' Death's remoter frightful Vaults I went,</l>
                        <l>Where ghastly Sprights their Follies past lament,</l>
                        <l>And in dispairing Sighs such Discord make,</l>
                        <l>No Soul could hear, but of their Grief partake,</l>
                        <l>Dreading from thence their sad remove each Hour,</l>
                        <l>To endless Pains, where Time shall be no more.</l>
                        <l>So the poor Thief, when seiz'd for his Offence,</l>
                        <l>Finds his own Conscience Judge and Evidence.</l>
                        <l>And thus, before he to the Bar shall come,</l>
                        <l>Dreads with sad Terror his succeeding Doom.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I forward press'd, bemoaning of their Case,</l>
                        <l>Freed from my Earth, Death ask'd me for no Pass,</l>
                        <l>But boldly shot the Adamantine Gates</l>
                        <l>Without repulse, unquestion'd by the Fates,</l>
                        <l>Who busie sate, with Distaff, Reel, and Knife,</l>
                        <l>Spining and cutting Man's short Threads of Life.</l>
                        <l>O'er scorching Sands, where fiery Seeds lay hid,</l>
                        <l>I Travell'd, till the <hi>Avernuan</hi> Hills I spy'd,</l>
                        <l>High were their gloomy Heads, the trodden Path as wide,</l>
                        <l>I ventur'd forwards, till to <hi>Styx</hi> I came,</l>
                        <l>Which shone like humid Vapours in a flame;</l>
                        <l>Its poysonous Fumes so fatal and impure,</l>
                        <l>None but Immortal Spirits can endure.</l>
                        <l>I stood a while, and ponder'd by the Lake</l>
                        <l>Upon the frightful Voyage I had still to take.</l>

                     <head>CANTO II.</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>My Resolutions now much stronger grew,</l>
                        <l>My first Intentions to at last pursue,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Charon</hi> I call'd, his leaky Boat to Freight,</l>
                        <l>Who in's infernal Pinnace nodding sate:</l>
                        <l>Hearing a Voice he started, and with speed,</l>
                        <l>He drag'd his rotten Bark from Mud and Weed:</l>
                        <l>With painful pulls he brought her to the Shore,</l>
                        <l>Black with the Guilt of those he'd wafted o'er.</l>
                        <l>The grisly Churl ask'd whither I wou'd go,</l>
                        <l>Up to <hi>Elizium,</hi> or the Shades below.</l>
                        <l>I told him I to <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Court was bound,</l>
                        <l>Where restless Souls amid'st their Pains are found.</l>
                        <l>The frowning Pilot finding me alone,</l>
                        <l>E'en bid me wait, for he'd not carry One.</l>
                        <l>'Twas I, said he, this Ferry first began,</l>
                        <l>And held it ever since the Fall of Man,</l>
                        <l>But never yet, as <hi>Pluto</hi> knows full well,</l>
                        <l>E'er wafted o'er one single Soul to Hell.</l>
                        <l>On Earth of what Imployment coud'st thou be,</l>
                        <l>Who com'st so destitute of Company:</l>
                        <l>Hard was thy Fate, to these dark Shades unknown,</l>
                        <l>Thou art the first that e'er was Damn'd alone.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I heard his Questions, but no Answer made,</l>
                        <l>And what he further ask'd did still evade,</l>
                        <l>With humble Words, that with him might prevail,</l>
                        <l>To take his Fare on board and set up Sail.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59366:5"/>
But all my soft Perswasions would not make,</l>
                        <l>The grim Tarpaulin his old Custom break,</l>
                        <l>Who gently row'd his Ferry to and fro,</l>
                        <l>Bauling aloud, <hi>Hey, downward, downward ho.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Thus for more Company being forc'd to wait,</l>
                        <l>Down on the Bank, amongst the Weeds, I sat,</l>
                        <l>And looking round me, at a distance saw,</l>
                        <l>A loit'ring Crowd towards <hi>Charon</hi>'s Ferry draw:</l>
                        <l>They gently crept along, oft seem'd to stay,</l>
                        <l>And hung their Arses as if bound my way:</l>
                        <l>So the Wretch, drove to suffer for his Crime,</l>
                        <l>Now steps, then stops, to lengthen out the Time.</l>
                     </lg>

                        <l>
                           <hi>Charon</hi> look'd out, the multitude drew nigh,</l>
                        <l>P—on'em, says the Churl, this sooty fry</l>
                        <l>Are Lawyers Souls, I know them by their dye.</l>
                        <l>Close to the <hi>Stygian</hi> Banks at last they came,</l>
                        <l>Showing some signs of Sorrow, some of Shame:</l>
                        <l>Despair and Anguish in their Looks I read,</l>
                        <l>Each did his sultry unknown Voyage dread;</l>
                        <l>And, Transport like, as gladly would be drown'd,</l>
                        <l>As see the slavish Shore to which they're bound.</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Charon</hi> pull'd near, but grumbl'd in the Throat,</l>
                        <l>Your pondrous Ills will never let me float,</l>
                        <l>You always come in Crowds, enough to sink my Boat:</l>
                        <l>If Hell in such mean Traffick means to Trade,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Pluto</hi> must get a stronger Vessel made:</l>
                        <l>But come, step in, and do not make me stay,</l>
                        <l>Pray trim the Boat, whilst I my Stretcher lay.</l>

                        <l>Then in we hobbl'd from a steep Descent,</l>
                        <l>Hoisted up Sail, and on our way we went;</l>
                        <l>Whilst I, not under the Decrees of Fate,</l>
                        <l>Amongst the sighing Crew with Pleasure sate,</l>
                        <l>Bearing some glim'rings of celestial Light,</l>
                        <l>With them compar'd, look'd innocent and bright,</l>
                        <l>As the tan'd Mariner 'mongst Negro Slaves looks white.</l>
                        <l>My Soul was light, and they so weighty were,</l>
                        <l>We held no poize, made <hi>Charon</hi> curse his Fare.</l>
                        <l>Who pull'd and puff'd, still roar'd with open Throat,</l>
                        <l>W—nds move your Shades, and better trim the Boat,</l>

                        <l>My Soul considering her diviner Air,</l>
                        <l>No ballance with their heavy Crimes could bear,</l>
                        <l>Stept from the side, and in the center got,</l>
                        <l>And to the Churls content I trim'd the Boat,</l>
                        <l>Which <hi>Charon</hi> skull'd a head with mighty pains,</l>
                        <l>Deep Laden as a Western Barge from <hi>Stains.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Downwards our Course, and as more way we made,</l>
                        <l>The Rocky Beach still loftier rais'd its Head;</l>
                        <l>Whose thistly Product all look'd parch'd and dry,</l>
                        <l>Like Weeds long ho'd that in the Sun-shine lye.</l>
                        <l>Vapours condens'd hung low'ring o'er each Head,</l>
                        <l>And sporting Daemons round the Vessel play'd.</l>
                        <l>Night-Ravens, Bats, and Screech-Owls then drew near,</l>
                        <l>To give old <hi>Charon,</hi> as he pass'd, a chear;</l>
                        <l>Who with their horrid Skrieks alarm'd each frighted Ear,</l>
                        <l>Mix'd with the Groans of filthy Souls from Stews,</l>

                        <l>And to his Scribe presents, with scraping Leg, the same;</l>
                        <l>Who bids the Booby Client chear his Heart,</l>
                        <l>And haughtily does bad Advice impart,</l>
                        <l>Fear not, says he, I'll make the Rascal smart;</l>
                        <l>But when his Purse has yielded up its Store,</l>
                        <l>His Cause proves bad, if he can bleed no more:</l>
                        <l>You told me wrong, did several things misplace,</l>

                        <l>They tax'd the Farmer as themselves should please:</l>

                        <l>And plagu'd the sinful Land like <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Frogs and Lice.</l>
                        <l>As they from Leathern Belt to Sword arose,</l>
                        <l>And from a rural Grey to Town-made Cloaths,</l>
                        <l>The greater value on their Pains they laid,</l>
                        <l>The more impos'd, the Client still obey'd,</l>
                        <l>And scrap'd and bow'd more low at ev'ry word he said.</l>
                        <l>These were the Locust first from Envy bred,</l>
                        <l>Who like the Drone, on others Labours fed;</l>

This said, the pensive Scribes were all set by,</l>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I Have reason to suspect, from some Clamours I have heard against the Title of this <hi>Poem,</hi> upon the Publication of the <hi>First Part,</hi> that 'tis a very wicked Age we live in, since the very Name of <hi>Hell</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> are such wonderful Scare-crows to a parcel of Puritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Fornicators, which, if they had been oftner put in mind of his Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worship, and his dreadful Dominions, might have been a means, for ought I know, of frighting 'em from a Licentious and Wicked Life, into more Honesty and Vertue. Words in themselves are no more than Marks by which we signifie or express the Conceptions of our own Minds, or raise up Idea's of the same things we represent in others.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to put the World in mind of <hi>Hell</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> in a justifiable way, representing both as terrible as the narrowness of my Capacity would give me leave, I hope can be no Fault, since it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable enough to believe, the dread of eternal Punishment deters more People from an Ill Life, than the hopes of everlasting Happiness has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc d to a Good one; for we may observe the weakness of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be such, that the fear of Wracks and Tortures has often brought Offenders and Conspirators to a Confession of their Guilt and Plots, when the reward of Life would not tempt 'em to a Discovery; and almost every Man may find, who will but examine himself or observe others, that Prosperity in this World does not so much elevate a Man, as Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity depresses him; Pleasure does not so much affect us as Pain, which makes us more watchful to avoid the one, than industrious to obtain the other. I declare my Intention to be good, and those that look into the Design without Prejudice, must allow it to be so: But as for such kind of zealous Shop-Criticks, who are afraid to peep into the Book because they see the Devil in the Title-Page, I must needs tell 'em, it favours more of ridiculous Preciseness and Hypocricy, than it does of true Zeel or good Judgment, and I think they deserve as much to be laugh'd at for being angry with the Title upon that Account, as the Lady did for burning her Bed upon another, which affording something of a Jest, I'll proceed to the Story. In the Times of Confusion, when the Sword had cut down the Scepter, Purity knock'd down the Church, and a High Court of Justice had destroy'd both Law and Equity, there happen'd then to be a very Devout Lady, who number'd her self amongst the prevailing
<pb facs="tcp:59366:20"/>
Saints, and would not suffer any thing that had been polluted to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under her Roof; the more to strengthen her in her Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises and Heavenly Meditations, she kept a thumping lusty Precisian in her House, which she call'd her Chaplain, who was always wonderful busie in watching the Lambs of Grace in the Family, 'that they might not Err and Stray like lost Sheep; and at last happen'd, by his vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, to discover a Man-Servant and a Maid-Servant upon a Bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in very close Conjunction, and running presently to the Good Lady, brought her to the Key-hole of the Door to be an Eye-witness of the Matter, who seeing such an abomination committed in her House, call'd out to 'em with all impatience to open the Door, and for a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of unsanctified Wretches to depart her House, which she fear'd would fall under some heavy Judgment for so vile a Transgression; their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness being done, in Obedience to their Lady's Commands, they drew the Bolt, and the enrag'd good Gentlewoman, with the assistance of her Holy Servant, turn'd 'em out into the Street, by Head and Shoulders, which being done, they consulted together how they should punish the defiled Bed, for assisting them in their Wickedness, at last concluded it should be burnt, which was done accordingly; who should come by, when the sinful Utensils were in Flames, but the Fellow who had been the Transgressor, and being inform'd what the Fire was made on, <hi>Egad,</hi> says he, <hi>they might as well have burnt all the Beds in the House, and most of the Chairs to boot; for there are none of the one, and very few of the other, but what, to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, have been privy to the same business.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I only give this Story as an Instance of the unaccountable Folly and blindness of some Folks Zeal; for if every Bed was to be burnt that has been thus polluted, and every Book to be supprest that has <hi>Hell</hi> or the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Name in it, our Libraries would be very thin, and our Houses but indifferently Furnish'd; besides, as to the latter, the drift of the whole <hi>Poem</hi> being to detect and scourge the Frauds and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of Men. I say, they may as well Censure most Sermons preach'd, in the Nation, wherein the same Bugbear Words are us'd with a good Intention: But however, because such Persons should not be Offended, I have, in this Part, put <hi>Hell</hi> with a dash, and supplied the place of <hi>the Devil</hi> with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Method, to please 'em, I shall continue in all the succeeding Parts, which (God willing) I intend to carry on as long as the World shall give Encouragement.</p>

                        <l>On others ruine have themselves enrich'd,</l>
                        <l>And with their charming Juice the World bewitch'd.</l>
                        <l>Crowds of poor Mortals in a Year they slew,</l>
                        <l>With base adulterated Stuffs they drew;</l>
                        <l>Impos'd on Customers when Drunk and Mad,</l>
                        <l>And with good Words wou'd put off Wine that's bad.</l>
                        <l>If fault, altho' deservedly, was found,</l>
                        <l>They'd tell ye, if they search'd the Cellar round,</l>
                        <l>They have no better, but with all their Heart,</l>
                        <l>Will change it for a strong or smaller sort</l>
                        <l>May please you better, but with some new Name</l>
                        <l>Wou'd bring the cred'lous Bubble back the same,</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59366:32"/>
And falsly swear his Pallat is amiss,</l>
                        <l>If he finds fault with such kind Wine as this,</l>
                        <l>For that to please his Taste he'd broach'd a fresher Piece.</l>
                        <l>Kept <hi>Cider</hi> in their Vaults with ill Design,</l>
                        <l>Yet vow they never mix but Wine with Wine;</l>
                        <l>Bought Eggs by Hundreds for their Cellars use,</l>
                        <l>The Yolks made Puddings, but the Whites for Juice.</l>
                        <l>For common Wine, unreasonably would ask</l>
                        <l>Six-Pence the more because 'twas in a Flask,</l>
                        <l>Bound with large Wickers, fill'd with heavy Port,</l>
                        <l>Sold for <hi>French</hi> Claret, wanting of a Quart.</l>
                        <l>And that their Crimes a deeper dye should take,</l>
                        <l>Ingratitude made all their Actions black;</l>
                        <l>For him wh'amongst 'em his Estate had spent,</l>
                        <l>When Poverty had brought him to repent</l>
                        <l>His Follies past, the Gainers in the end,</l>
                        <l>Would blame him most, and be the least his Friend.</l>
                        <l>Thus, says Hell's Pleader, I my Charge conclude,</l>
                        <l>And to your Lordship leave the Tipling Multitude.</l>
                        <l>The Judge sum'd up, in a short Speech, their Sins,</l>
                        <l>And then the Culprits Doom he thus begins.</l>

                        <l>For Evils done above, from whence you came,</l>
                        <l>Infernal Fevers shall your Souls inflame;</l>
                        <l>Eternal Drowth upon your Tongues shall dwell,</l>
                        <l>And all be fetter'd near an empty Well;</l>

                        <l>Burnt Brandy shall your only Liquor be,</l>
                        <l>And in this State remain to all Eternity.</l>
