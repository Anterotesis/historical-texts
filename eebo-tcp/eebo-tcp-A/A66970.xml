            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing (Pious <hi>Reader</hi>) wherein a Christian can receiue a greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in order to Saluation,<note place="margin">§. I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> then to be any way misinformed, or prejudiced concerning <hi>Prayer:</hi> and too much pains cannot be taken in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to satisfy all doubts and scruples raised on this subject. I have therfore thought fit to enlarge myself in this ensuing discourse, not only in discussing punctually page by page that part of <hi>Doctour Stilling fleets</hi> late Book that handles this matter, but also in premising (for the <hi>Readers</hi> benefit) a more Generall Account of the <hi>Church's Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> herein; as being the most fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall part of a Christians Duty, and wherein Man, whil'st here on earth, entertains a nearer conversation with Heaven; as also the instrument, by which he derives from thence all other <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Blessings,</hi> Spirituall or Temporall.</p>
            <p>And here I may first say this,<note place="margin">§. II.</note> in my entrance vpon this task; that there is no part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church might think herself more secure from blame and censure; and wherein her extraordinary care and prudence for the right Guidance of her children in this Holy exercise (as appears by the great store of writings vpon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) doth more deserue praise euen from her Adversaries; all Sects borrowing from Her, <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Patterns</hi> for <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58163:4"/>
as the Catholick Books on this subject tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated and rendred common among them do abundantly witness. For, from whom can they learn these so well, as from those, who most practise Prayer? and who are they, but those who also vse solitude and Retirement, and a sequestration of themselues from all unnecessary secular affaires, to attend altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this Holy exercice, who renounce all worldly wealth, and prevent the trouble of a conjugal life, of children, family, and the like, and so both the cares of this world, and the necessary causes thereof, that so they may calmely and quietly entertain a closer communication with God, and have their <hi>conversation in Heaven,</hi> whilst here on Earth: Or to vse the Apostles language, 1. Cor. 7. that so <hi>they may giue themselves to Fasting, and Prayer.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>may be without solicitude</hi> ver. 32. <hi>may take care only for the things of the Lord, how they may please the Lord.</hi> Ib. and <hi>that they may attend upon him without distraction</hi> ver. 35. Which they doing, I hope it may seem no wonder, if God also vse a greater familiarity towards them, delight to be with them; he and those of his Court; and shew them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Kindnes, who love him more (or nothing but him:) and whom also he loves more: who is no mans debter in love; and who also loveth first, otherwise they could not love him at all; <hi>&amp; magit amat, &amp; ante.</hi>

In the former of these we may safely conclude; that, that which is <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest</hi> to vs to be the better as to our perfection is the motion in vs of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; and that the doing it is the doing the <hi>wil</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in this matter; and that, so often as we reject, or neglect, this, so often we <hi>contristate</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> (that would thus conduct vs to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;) and refuse to do <hi>Gods will,</hi> when this is known to vs; Whose wil it ought always to be presumed to be, that we should do that, which is cleare to vs, all things considered,

to be best, for his glory, and our good, to be done; though such omission or neglect, amounts not to a sin, but to a failing so much in Perfection. And indeed the not vigilantly observing these Motions of the Spirit within vs, and the not hearkning to and obeying them when evident to be such, or also, the not preconsulting by prayer what it adviseth, but rather precipitating our action to prevent it, is the Reason of so many their no greater improvement in the Spirit, and that they are such strangers to it, and It to them; is a check to the further, and stronger operations of it in the Soul; (for who would offer Counsel, seldome, or never accepted, or asked?) abates the fervour, and solace, that there would be in prosecuting it's suggestions and leave vs guilty of much vnkindnes, and ingratitude.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58163:20"/>
are Supernatural and Divine. So, S. Austin <note n="*" place="margin">Confess. l. 6. c. 13.</note> relates of his Mother Monica, that she clearly knew such Supernatural actings in her from her own imaginations.— <hi>Dicebat enim, discernere se nescio quo sapore, quem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis explicare non poterat, quid interesset inter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velantem Te, &amp; animam suam somniantem.</hi> And indeed, if such interiour Divine operations Were not somtimes certainly discernable, how could S. Paul be assured, when he intended to preach the Word in Asia, and again in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia, (a most charitable designe!) that the <hi>Spirit</hi> forbad it; and not rather the Enemy of the publishing of the Gospel? Act. 16.6.7.— or, That it was <hi>by Revelation,</hi> and not a fancy of his, that he ascended to Jerusalem? Gal. 2.2. Or, That it Was the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that <hi>testified,</hi> and not men's fears, that much affliction should happen to him there? Act. 20.23. How the Corinthians knew, when they had a Revelation,<note place="margin">Cor. 14.</note> that it was not a work of their own imagination? since all these things were transacted only interiourly in the Soul, and it was the Holy Spirit only, that in all these gave the evidence to itself. A certain Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then, it cannot be denyed, that some at somtimes may have of Divine operations in them. But yet it is not affirmed here, that all persons, less advanced in Prayer, and Purity of life, or also the greatest Saints at all times, discern the operations of the Holy Spirit within them so clearly in this sort of actions, as not to be somtimes mistaken; and it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that persons piously disposed, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58163:20"/>
frequent in Prayer, may have a rational pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of it as hath been said: Neither is any more communicated vnto them, perhaps, for the better preserving of their Humility. And, that no absolute certitude is herein to be expected is a thing often confessed by Sancta Sophia. See 1. vol. p. 139. and p. 137.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But 4. in case such Divine inspirations be somtimes mistaken, yet can no dammage come thereby, I mean as to committing any Sin; 1. the subject of them we speak of here being matters in themselves indifferent, and on any side lawfull.

No command of Superiours in these any way neglected. 3. no neglect, besides vsing Prayer, in practising any other means of making a secure choice, either in weighing reasons on all sides, or taking advice from others: Only the deuout Soul, in vsing these endeavours, yet relies not on them, but on the directions of Gods Holy Spirit, working continually in the <hi>Regenerate</hi> both by preve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and subsequent Grace: makes no sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den resolutions, nor rushes hastily vpon any action; but diligently hearkens first to this internal Guide, what it may tell her is best; desiring faithfully, all naturall Passions and self-love layd aside, to correspond with all it's motions; the carefull observers of which with a pure intention of mind may be justly presumed seldome to Want them, though they do not so certainly know them; and mean while such persons, if not free always from mistakes, yet are secure, in this sort of actions

Having spoken thus much (from §. 3.) of the extraordinary and Supernaturall Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Favours, the Illuminations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Spirit, that are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by God to persons of greater Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and practice of Prayer, which do also more clearly and evidently guide them in all their actions; and of the discerning of these from other Enthusiasms and Illusions; In the last place I shall consider the <hi>Churches Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> concerning <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> the chief means of procuring all these Divine <hi>Graces</hi>; which Directions this our Author <note n="*" place="margin">Roman Idol. c. 4. p. 325.</note> censures to be <hi>such as if they were designed only to amuse and confound the minds of devout persons and to prepare them for the most gross Enthusias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and extravagant illusions of fancy</hi>; whereas indeed there is no part of a Christian's duty, in which the Church, by those many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of hers, Mysticks, and others, who have chiefly employed their talent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated their experience, on this Subject, hath taken more profitable pains, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended lower, even to the meanest capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nor where this displeased Author can find less ground for a quarrel. Infinite are the Books written on this Divine Art of Prayer; Wherein like a careful Mother, she trains vp her children, by certain degrees, from the lowest step thereof, which touches
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58163:21"/>
the ground, to the highest, which reaches to heaven; knowing it to be the Foundation of all Goodnes; and the Attractive of all the Divine Benedictions, and Benefits.</p>
            <p>She then, first here, in preparation for Prayer, adviseth her Children to a serious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep their conscience clear from Mortal sin (or also Venial, as much as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty permits;) and to a care of avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the occasions thereof, without which endeavour our devotions cannot be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God; I mean, as to the receiving from him any great plenty of his Grace: And, again, requires, at such times of Prayer, a dismission of, and abstraction from all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar busines; Solitude, and a recollection of the mind and thoughts, and oblivion, so much as we can, of all creatures; and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving also of all hindrances, that may come from the objects of the exteriour senses, &amp;c. These presupposed; She first begins to feed her little ones with milk, and as it were to chew their meat for them; giving them infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite prescriptions, for all occasions, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> where Novices begin; and Which the most perfect, also return to.</p>
            <p>From these <hi>Vocal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58163:22"/>
shews;) and more freed from the distraction of the senses, and also from the wandring of the Thoughts; to which vocal Prayer gives more relaxation: Nor is it so easy to think, as to speak, one thing and mind another; but, for how long time the attention ceaseth, so long doth Mental Prayer; and we are either not distracted, or not praying. Here likewise she delivers them many vseful <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of <hi>Meditation,</hi> chiefly these either tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our own misery; or the Misteries of our Saluation; or the Divine Perfections. The Negative benefit also of which Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confined to some certain Subject, at the first is very considerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in preventing distraction of thoughts, and taking of the mind from it's usual amusements, and wings about external, worldly, vain, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things: The Books written in this kind are almost infinite, not vnfrequent in Protestants hands, and on each subject some brief <hi>Heads</hi> perscribed, whereon the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants may enlarge their thoughts; Where also she directs the <hi>reading</hi> of some Pious <hi>Book,</hi> when there is much distraction of Thoughts, or sterility of Invention. And, in these <hi>Meditations,</hi> She trains them first more in those, of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of their <hi>natural</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of the <hi>Hainousness</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi>; of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Iustice</hi>; of the <hi>bitter Passion</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> in making Satisfaction for sin; of the <hi>Terrours</hi> of the <hi>Tria Novissima,</hi> 1.<hi>Death.</hi> 2. <hi>Iudgment,</hi> 3. <hi>Hell;</hi> and the like: to plant in them <hi>a due Fear</hi> of God, and advance all sorts of <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58163:22"/>
and a cleansing of themselves from the former habits of Sins. After this she practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them much in the Meditation of the <hi>Life</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and the Lives of his <hi>Saints,</hi> as constant Patterns for their Imitation, as to <hi>growth</hi> in <hi>vertue</hi>; lastly, of the Divine, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and also many Benefits to vs; those already received, and those promised; of the Graces and operations of the Holy Ghost within vs, and the abilities for doing good, and pleasing God, restored to Man by it, if attentively observed, and obeyed; by these to advance them in all Spiritual Grace, and Christian Perfection; and to enkindle in them an <hi>ardent Love</hi> of God. The acquisition of which <hi>Love,</hi> and not of <hi>knowledge</hi> is the Churcheschief design in all these Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

the Reasonablenes of Christian Religion? For, this, I hope, is not Reasonable, that nothing in Religion may be above Reason; and somthings therin, that are less easy to be vnderstood, are therfore to be received with admiration rather, then scorne, If the Church <hi>speaks wisdome among the Perfect,</hi> may the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect blame her for this?

            <p>This Author is a great Common Reason Man;<note place="margin">§. XLIII.</note> and often appeals, and summons vs to the Barr of <hi>Reason</hi>; and would perswade, that the Religion of Catholicks is no Reasonable Religion. But it is noted (which is some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to him and his party) that all Hereticks have always done the like. Nay it is also Clear, that they cannot do otherwise. For, since a cause must be defended either by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Reason, (for who will at once affront both these?) whilst these men do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the one, they are driven to pretend the other. To clear this matter, I suppose by Reason is not meant here meerly arguing, or reasoning: for this is, and must be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vsed equally on all sides, on all Subjects, either when wee dispute for, or against Reason. Here then must be mean't, the Naturall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason that Catholicks are enemies to. And, contrarily, Catholicks affirm, that neither they, nor their Religion maintains (though indeed many things above, yet) any thing contrary to, true Reason; or any true Principle thereof. For, <hi>omne verum omni vero consonat</hi>? But notwithstanding first they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that many things in Religion may seem contrary to the best Arguments which we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58163:35"/>
have from seeming Reason, or from the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Principles thereof; and so, that seeming Reason (for, true, all things considered, never can do so) dictates one thing to vs, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or Divine Revelation, another: and, that here all seeming contrary Reason, I add, or also sense whatever, is to yield to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Revelation</hi>: and the <hi>certainty</hi> of Such <hi>Revelation,</hi> only, is abundantly sufficient to proue the contrary to be no true <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> nor true information of Sense. And nothing is more Reasonable then this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods Revelation carries also the Divine Reason (if I may so say) or knowledge along with it; which is above man's. 2. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks affirm, that, as many things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are contrary to seeming Reason; so many go above or beyond the latitude, or capacity of Reason. In which though our Reason apprehends that these things are so, they are proposed to it; and apprehended also some Motives, why, in prudence, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be so; yet from its own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it cannot comprehend, why, or how, they are so: Nor can discover any such things by its own light. <hi>Animalis homo non percipit, quae sunt Spiritus Dei; stultitia enim illi, &amp; non potest intelligere, quia Spiritualiter examinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>

Happiest he who ever thus most <hi>vnknows</hi> both <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>himself</hi>; and thus he becomes the better prepared for a more immediate, and intimate vnion, by Love, to his Creator; This our being wholy Mortified to the world and weaned from the Creature (and so from ourselves) as if it <hi>were not,</hi> is one of the chief Lessons that is taught in the Catholick Schoole of <hi>Devotion.</hi> And as God manifests to any Souls his <hi>Greatnes,</hi> so there more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them, the <hi>litleness</hi> or <hi>nothingness</hi> of the Creature. 2. Removing them, As they relate to our <hi>Meditations</hi>; in laying aside, as much as we can these workings of the Braine, after the Soul perceiues herself sufficiently excited by them to Acts of Love: for now, Such Meditations become hindrances, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58163:41"/>
distractions to <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and then, when our Will is fixed on that supremely amiable object, the enioyment of which we seek by them: Which the <hi>Affective</hi> part of the Soul more quietly possesseth, as our imagination worketh and disturbeth it less; and when the Soul in respect of these Images, is at it were in the darke and sees least of them, I mean such Images, as the act of love, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, or affective meditation (rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused then acquired) do not necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. Indeed the greatest disturbance we find in our prayers (and therfore it needs to be no wonder if the Mysticks speak so much of them) is from these <hi>Images</hi> of wordly things; so lively drawn and imprinted in our Fancy by our much trafficking with them, that the Soul at her devotions is frequently casting her eye aside, vpon them: And the greatest art of a christian is to deface these Images there, as much as he can, that he may keep his mind fixed on somthing much nobler, and better: and the way to obliterate them again is, to sequester ourselves, as much as necessity and duty permits, from negotiating with these <hi>wordly affaires,</hi> and <hi>cares,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily stay them there.</p>

The summe of that, which is cited here out of Sancta Sophia's directions, for our attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such Vnion with God, is this. That there is a seeking of Such Vnion with God &amp;c. either more with the acts of <hi>Meditation</hi> performed by the Vnderstanding; which is called <hi>an Active state of Prayer</hi>; or more by exercising the <hi>Acts of Love</hi> by the Will, It being only assisted and furnished with some common notions of the intellect, Of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of God his being the most perfect amiable and beatifying obiect, the most worthy of all praise, honour, adoration, love &amp;c. Without the trouble of those many phantasmes, and images borrowed from the Creatures abroad, which the Intellect must make vse of in its subtile discourses, and which many times steal its thoughts away from the Meditation designed. Of these Acts of Love you may see great variety for patterns set down at the end of Sancta Sophia p. 26. &amp;c. (Not that these two <hi>Meditations</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations,</hi> or that the Acts of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> are perfectly severed from one another; but only <hi>secundum magis &amp; minus</hi>; the one vsed much more, then the other.)

Much discouraged also at such times many are, in imagining, that God hath so deserted them, for failings in their duty, or for something wherein they have offended his Divine Majesty, which doubles this anguish. Or, if not this, at least they imagine it to be caused by some great indisposition of Body (as it is granted sometimes partly it may) so as some begin therfore to dispense for a time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58163:47"/>
with the former exercises of their Devotion, and other pious employments. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing many times in these, the poor Soul is mistaken; and this strange deiection of Spirit, comes, without any such respects, meerly from the sole will of God, and is the ordinary course of his proceeding with those also, who are by his former Graces well grounded, and arrived to some degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and is sent only for their much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advancement therin, and the rendring them more capable of higher favours; and therfore ought, as such, to be entertained with all equanimity, patience, resignation, and conformity to his Will.</p>
            <p>These Consolations, and Desolations, take as it were their certain turnes in them; as they do, in a lesser degree, in all the Regenerate; they have by course a Day, and a Night, an Ascent towards God, and a Descent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadence into themselves; a vivification by and in him, and a Mortification in themselves; a Summer, wherin the branches shoot forth, and fruit comes to maturity, and a Winter when the root spreads more, and the Tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more surely fixed. To all Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do these vicissitudes happen, but these in a higher degree to the further advanced in Perfection; and the greatest Favours are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded with greater Desolations: and these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily proportioned one to the other. And alwais necessary less or more are such purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and refinings of the Soul by these inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Crosses, because alwais somthing in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58163:48"/>
them is amiss, and as yet imperfect. Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption is still producing somthing in vs to be amended; and some self will, and self love to be pared away by this sharp reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whilst we are in this life. And the benefit of these <hi>Desolations,</hi> if rightly complied with, as well as of Divine <hi>Consolations</hi> is very great in many respects.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. LXV.

Herein it is, that the Soul is preserved amidst such Divine Favours, which are apt to inflate it, in a due and necessary Humility (<hi>Angelus Satanae cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisans, ne magnitudo Revelationum extollat me.</hi> Saith the Apostle after his Rapt.)

Lastly, by and vpon these Spiritual Desolations ordinarily it is, that the Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward receives higher sensible visits, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses from God, then any former were; for which the Soul seems best prepared by this her extreme poverty, and lowness; and then it is, if ever, the Soul receives them with more gratitude; and both highlier values them, and vilifies it self.

For, so often, the omission of it is not lawfull (they always suppose) but a sin. Or, 2. will he say because externall good works, outward duties of worship &amp;c. are Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Precepts, therfore private prayer is none? Or 3. will he argue: when ever we can do any of these, therfore we may not at any such time better omit them, and do something
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58163:53"/>
else? All these consequences are faulty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Precepts oblige not all persons, not at all, times; and the Acts of them are in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio,</hi> not <hi>Praecepto,</hi> except in some case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; and then <hi>toties quoties,</hi> the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative's Devotions, as they profess are to be laid aside.</p>

here selects, (and omits the other that were to the purpose,) are concerning the motions of Gods Spirit in matters, or actions, &amp; omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, agreed on to be in themselves indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and lawfull, or also good.

               <hi>The only meanes imaginable that can be proper,</hi> &amp;c.

be guided; as we have in all such other actions the lawfulness wich is doubted of; Which yet is not said, as if Prayer were the only means of our direction in these, so as to exclude the making use of, either our own Reason, or other mens Advice; as is said before.</p>

And then what <hi>Illumination</hi> he prays for, why may not he also expect?

Faults; or admonitions for the better ordering of his life; <hi>Spiritu</hi> (as our Lord Saith Io. 3.8.) <hi>Spirante ubi vult,</hi> and he not knowing whence such things come, or how they passe away; yet these things we are assured must be from Gods Spirit, because no <hi>good thought</hi> is from our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And why may not we imagine the same, (a due preparation being supposed) of the thoughts iniected in our doubtings, and requests, concerning actions left free, and vndetermined by the Divine declared will, what way in these we may rather take, the better to serve and please him. God forbid, that the name of Enthusiasme should deterr Christians from such a practice, or hearkning to this internall Language; Or (as M. Cressy expresses it in his Preface <note n="*" place="margin">p. 19.</note>) <hi>should render Prayer and by Prayer, the obtaining of Divine Grace, a suspicious exercise</hi> And I wish the Author would a little better weigh his words, and the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne influence they may have on others.

               <hi>What means that saying in the Spirituall exercises,</hi> &amp;c. I have an Edition of the Spirituall Exercises printed at vienna 1563<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is after S. Ignatius his death (and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing added to them since;) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1574. wherein I can find no such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. Nor is it (as this Author confesseth) to be found in the later <hi>Impressions.</hi> Is he not then hard put to it, to find <hi>fuell</hi> enough for enflaming the popular hate against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that runs to such old Editions for it (and this only out of a report, not knowledge, that it is there) when the newer do not supply it; Nor yet will forgive nor forget their fault (Suppose one) when he finds, they have amended it? But now to consider the words, so happily discovered. The words are these—
<q>It is the great perfection of a Christian to keep himself indifferent to do what God shall reveal to him, and not to determine himself indifferent to do what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready revealed, and taught in the Gospell.</q>
Their sence must either be this; that S. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius directs his Sons <hi>not to determine</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to do what God hath already revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and taught in the Gospell, but to keep themselves indifferent to do the contrary, if revealed to them. Or <hi>els That they are not to determine themselves to do only what God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready revealed, and taught in the Gospel.</hi> (that is as to the things commanded, and prohibited there;) <hi>but also to keep themselves indifferent</hi> (as to the things on either side lawful to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58163:58"/>
done) to do that, which God shall reveal to them. that is, shall reveal to them, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it to him in Prayer, by the internal illuminations and inspirations of his Holy Spirit to be, <hi>ad majorem Dei Gloriam,</hi> and more conformable to his will. Of which much hath bin said before §. 21. &amp;c. Of these two senses the former is too gross and impious in conscience for S. Ignatius to prescribe to his whole Order in a book pretending Devotion, and so publick in the face of the whole Church; let this Glorious Saint be supposed as great an Hypocrire or Fanatick as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would make him. For what Fanatick will say so much? In the latter sense I see no harm vnless the word (<hi>reveale</hi>) displease; but then change it into <hi>God shall inspire them,</hi> and the Protestants common Prayer Book will iustify the language.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. LXXXIV.</note>
               <hi>That is for new and strange Revelations too,</hi> &amp;c. If Mother Iuliana's Revelations have many things new and strange, yet, if therein be nothing contrary to Faith or <hi>Good manners,</hi> nor words taken in a modern-improper sence will amount to Heresy, I hope this Author will not put her in the List of his Fanaticks, vnless he can make good the same of them; or, that he can prove her old English to be Fanaticism, but then let Chaucer also look to himself.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58163:58"/>
(that is, Ecclesiasticall Superiours) than to make their Office the keeping of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, had he remembred that the Church of England in her Liturgy recommends <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>; but, this, so litle practised, he might the easier forget it. Men chained can do no harm; as Fanaticks are in the Roman Church, thanks to their Holy keepers; and for the persons vnder such custody, their being sober, or mad, (for, either they may be) it is fit the Church should rather iudge of it then this Author; who here pronounceth that <hi>Madness,</hi> which these Confessors, and the Church take for <hi>Perfection.</hi> And so it is, that All persons being diligently watched by these keepers, those judged Fanaticks by the Church, all, sooner, or later, even all those with much pains col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this Book by this Author, that were truly Such, have bin crushed by her hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and have no present being: I wish it were so with the English Fanaticks. But whilst they do impose no such keepers over them, nor can iustly deny that liberty of iudgment to others, which they have taken to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, what hope is there of their suppression, or, what iust Laws, I mean Ecclesiasticall, can there be made for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are not to think that the Principles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. LXXXVI.</note> &amp;c. For the seditious or rebellious facts of any Fanaticks in the Catholick Church diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, or breaking loose from their keepers, if any such can be proued by this Author, they are not iustified by the Church, or its <hi>Principles,</hi> and so he looseth his labour in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58163:59"/>
thinking to preiudice the Church by them, any more, than by proving some Adulterers, Homicides, Blasphemers to have bin in it. And within the memory of man the Church of England was not free from having such facts committed by some of her Body and Communion; yet, I suppose this Author will maintain, without her guilt.</p>
