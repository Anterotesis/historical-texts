            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A Helliſh conſpiracy of divers wicked and deſperate perſons againſt the Kings Life and Government having been ſometime paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, upon the Iſſuing out of His Majeſties Proclamation, amongſt other Traytors and Conſpirators theſe, on whom Juſtice has deſervedly fixed Her ſevereſt mark, were apprehended, <hi>viz.

being prevented by Providence, even to a miracle, all their pernicious devices vaniſhed into Air, and themſelves rendred dreadful Examples to poſterity, and fully opened the eyes of ſuch as would not be perſwaded, but this ſort of men were men of harmleſs principles, and that what had paſſed in the Days of <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> were but Shams to amuſe the people. But to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
            <p>The Priſoners aforeſaid being in ſundry places apprehended, order was given for their Tryals at the Seſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> holden at the <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Old Baley,</hi> &amp;c. where <hi>Walcot</hi> being Arraigned, Pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi> to his Indictment, in which were ſpecified the Treaſons of which he ſtood accuſed, as his deſigning the Murther of the King, and a miſerable ſlaughter of his Subjects, to leavy War and Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence being called, the principal of which were Collonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi> who having declared the manner of the Conſpiracy, and to what intent it was carryed on, charged the Priſoner with being at divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, where the death of the King and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were reſolved upon, and that upon their return from <hi>New-market;</hi> at what time <hi>Walcot</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with a Commanded Party to fall upon the Guards, whilſt <hi>Rumbold</hi> the Malſter was to Aſſaſſinate his Majeſty and Royal Highneſs, and others to Kill the Poſtillian, Coachman and Horſes, and that they ſtiled him the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Gulin,</hi> ſaying, he woud be ſuch when at the head of an Army. And it was further witneſſed againſt him, that he had provided himſelf Horſe and Arms, and went to take a view of <hi>Rumbolds</hi> Houſe near <hi>Hodsdon,</hi> and did approve of its commodiouſneſs for the perpetration of the Villany, which was to have been done whilſt an overthrown Cart had ſtopped His Majeſties Coach; and that the Priſoner was tempted to undertake the actual Aſſaſſination, but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, ſaying, he would not kill a naked man, but would undertake Fighting the Guards. Theſe and other Treaſonable Conſpiracies being proved againſt him, and a Letter produced which he had ſent to Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins,</hi> therein promiſing to make a more perfect diſcovery of the Helliſh deſign, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> than what as he believed others were able to do, if he might thereby hope for any mercy at His Majeſties hands; as likewiſe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter taken from him in Priſon, drawn up in order to be ſent to a Friend of his, to intreat Collonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> to be favourable to him in their Evidence, he was found Guilty; and two days after, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt received Sentence to be Drawn, Hanged and Quartered: At what time he only deſired that his Friends might be permitted to viſit him during his continuance in <hi>Newgate,</hi> which was allowed; and ſo, as a Man not ſeeming much concerned at what had befallen him, he was conveyed to the place from whence he came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Hone</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Walcot</hi> in taking his Tryal at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the Death of the King, Leavying War, and procuring Arms, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny treaſonable Expreſſions by him uttered, he at firſt denyed the Indictment in general, and pleaded <hi>Not Guilty;</hi> but better conſidering with himſelf, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to retract that Plea, and plead <hi>Guilty</hi> as to the Conſpiracy againſt the Kings Life, but would not confeſs his procuring Arms; yet upon his Tryal, it was plainly proved that a Horſe and Arms were provided, and that he was to be one in the Aſſaſſination, that he had been at ſeveral traiterous conſults,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52236:2"/>
and malitiouſly ſpoken divers Treaſonable words, moſt of which he owned in Court, ſeeming greatly troubled that he had conſented to ſo great a Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, declaring to God and the World, that <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> had ſeduced him, and perſwaded him to enter into the Helliſh Conſpiracy, as alſo ſome others of the Conſpirators, by inſinuating the pretended grievances of the Nation, and laying before him the advantage that would accrue thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Rouſe</hi> this time failing of an <hi>Ignoramus Jury,</hi> having been upon his Tryal at the <hi>Old-Baley</hi> found Guilty of divers Conſpiracies, and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Contrivances againſt the Life of His Majeſty, contrived and and committed, according as it was given in Evidence againſt him, both before and ſince his being a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> was Sentenc'd for High-Treaſon, together with <hi>Walcot</hi> and <hi>Hone;</hi> the Sentence being, That they, and either of them ſhould return to the place from whence they came, and from thence be drawn upon Hurdles, or Sledges, to the place of Execution, and there be Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Necks, then cut down alive, their Bowels taken out, and Privities cut off to be burnt before their Faces, their Heads cut off, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which, <hi>Rouſe</hi> made a long Preamble about his being Innocent, as to many particulars, yet declared he was willing to ſubmit to the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tryals over, and Sentence as is ſpecified, they were carryed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> where, for the moſt part, they were kept aſſunder, yet had divers of their Friends came to viſit them, and many godly Miniſters to give them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for their Souls health, laying before them the heinouſneſs of the Crime; and the rather, becacauſe they had ſinned againſt ſuch goodneſs, and agravated the Crime in Conſpiring againſt the Life of a Prince, under whom they did and might have Lived happily; but ſeeing Divine Juſtice had overtaken them, and no hopes of continuing long in this World, that they would bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſpend the few moments that were left them to the advantage of their Immortal Souls, and not through neglect render themſelves doubly wretched: To this and ſuch like Ghoſtly advice they were obſerved to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentive, eſpecially <hi>Hone,</hi> who expreſſed abundance of ſorrow for the greatneſs of his offence, ſaying, that by reaſon of his former Sins, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be reclaimed, God had ſuffered him to fall into this great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſiring, the Prayers of all good men, ſaying that if he might Live, all the buſineſs of his Life would prove inſufficient to expiate ſo great a Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walcot</hi> and <hi>Rouſe</hi> appeared more retired and reſerved, the former ſeeming for the moſt part willfuly, obſtinate or moroſs; yet in his countenance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a remorſe and regret for what he had Acted, ſeeming rather to confeſs then deny the horrid deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rouſe</hi> was obſerved for the moſt part to be greatly dejected, often Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wretched ſtate; and thus continued theſe Miſcreants, whom Malice, hope of Gain or Preferment has brought to ruin and a ſhameful, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved end, on this 20th. of <hi>July,</hi> on which day they were drawn upon Sledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the place of Execution, where after they had expreſſed a ſorrow for the henious Conſpiracy, and treaſonable Crimes intended againſt the Life of the beſt of Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſaid ſome ſhort Prayers, they ſuffered according to the Sentence aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52236:3"/>The Executioner Imboweling and Quartering them, the Quarters we are informed are by His Majeſties Bounty reſtored to their Relations: And thus fell thoſe miſerable men the ſad Example of offended Juſtice, having brought themſelves to ſhameful ends, by deſigning the blackeſt of Crimes; but 'tis often apparent, that thoſe who act againſt the Lives of Sacred Kings, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall into the Snare themſelves have laid, as it was obſerved by the inhumane Monſters that Trayterouſly, barbarouſly and Villainouſly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered His Majeſties Father of Bleſſed memory, and indeed in all Ages wherein ſuch wicked deſigns have taken Birth: For God has declared, <hi>He that ſpils Mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſpilt.</hi> And certainly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and deſign it by Helliſh and Diabolick Conſpiracies, is no leſs heinous in the ſight of the Juſt Creator: Therefore I hope this timely and moſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous diſcovery, together with the puniſhment inflicted upon the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will prove a ſufficient warning to deter others from the like inhumane undertaking.</p>
