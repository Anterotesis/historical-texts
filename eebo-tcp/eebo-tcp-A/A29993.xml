            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WHEN I began to write upon
this Subject, it was out of
a Curiosity I had to try, what I could
say, in reason, against the bold Assertions
of those Men, who think it a witty thing
to defame Religion; and I have seen
so few Writings of late, which are
<pb facs="tcp:56774:3"/>
not very tedious, that I was desirous at
least to avoid that fault in this, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it as short as I could.</p>
            <p>The Reason why I have suffer'd it to
be Printed, is indeed, Because I could not
help it; Coppies having been taken of it,
and sent to the Press, by the negligence
of some to whom I lent it to Read. I
was as much ashamed to forbid the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, as I should have been, to have
order'd it, or as I should be now it is
Printed, to disown what I have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and therefore, I have here set my
Name to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the nature of this Discourse, I
was forced to Conclude with an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I have been long convinced
of;</hi> That nothing can be more Anti-christian,
nor more contrary to Sense
<pb facs="tcp:56774:3"/>
and Reason, than to Trouble and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
our Fellow-Christians, because they
cannot be exactly of our Minds, in
all the things relating to the Worship
of God.</p>
            <p>And who will but examine what mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Men there are now amongst
us, of different Perswasions in Religion;
and how inconsiderable any one part of
them is, compared to the rest, must, I
am confident, be convinced, That the
practice of it, at this time, would be of
no advantage to the Publick.</p>
            <p>If a serious consideration of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State of this Kingdom, can sink deep
enough into Men's Hearts, to make them
endeavour, now, to promote a true Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conscience, I shall yet hope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
happy days in <hi>England.</hi> But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb facs="tcp:56774:4"/>
without pretending to be a Prophet,
I can easily foresee, That the contrary
must of necessity terminate in this; <hi>A
General Discontent; The Dispeopleing
of our poor Country; And the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
us to the Conquest of a Foreign
Nation.</hi>

            <head>A
Short Discourse
UPON THE
REASONABLENESS
Of MEN'S having a
RELIGION,
OR
Worship of God.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing that gives
Men a greater dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than to find themselves
disappointed in their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations;
especially of those things in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56774:5"/>
which they think themselves most
concern'd; and therefore all, who go
about to give Demonstrations in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, and fail in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
do not onely leave Men less
Devout than they were before, but
also, with great pains and industry,
lay in their Minds the very Grounds
and Foundations of Atheism: For
the generality of Mankind, either
out of laziness, or a diffidence of
their being able to judge aright in
Points that are not very clear, are apt
rather to take things upon trust than
to give themselves the trouble to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether they be true or no.
But when they find, that what a Man
undertakes to give them for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
is really none at all,
they do not onely conclude they are
deceived by him, but begin also to
suspect, they have been ill used, by
those, who first impos'd upon them a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56774:5"/>
Notion, for which no Demonstration
can be given; and from that suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
proceed to this other of a more
dangerous consequence; That what
is not demonstrable, may perhaps
too not be true.</p>
            <p>I shall, therefore in this Discourse,
make use of another method, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my self with endeavouring to
shew what, in my Opinion, is most
probable: Demonstration being, as to
Matters of Faith, absolutely unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
Because, if I can convince a Man,
That the Notions I maintain are more
likely to be True than False, it is not
in his power not to believe them; no
Man believing any thing because he
has a mind to believe it, but because
his Judgment is convinc'd, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but believe it, whether he
will or no: and Belief is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us in the Speculative part
of Religion.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56774:6"/>
            <p>Besides, Demonstration being such
an Evidence of a thing, as shows the
contrary of it to be impossible; it is,
if you mark it, a whimsical kind of
expression to say, That a Man does
but believe a thing to be so, which he
is sure cannot possibly be otherwise.
It is just as ingenious as if one should
profess, That he hopes he shall but
begin to have a thing to morrow,
which he is already this day in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of. Belief and Faith being as
intirely swallow'd up in Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as Hope is in Fruition.</p>
            <p>My design in this Paper is, To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Men to a belief of Religion, by
the strength of Reason; and therefore,
I am forc'd to lay aside all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which have any dependence
upon the Authority of Scripture,
and must fashion my Discourse as if
I had to do with those that have no
Religion at all.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56774:6"/>
            <p>The first main Question, upon the
clearing of which I shall endeavour
to ground the <hi>Reasonableness of Men's
having a Religion, or Worship of God,</hi> is
this, <hi>Whether it is more probable that the
World has ordered it self to be in the Form
it now is, or was contriv'd to be so by
some other Being of a more perfect, and
more designing nature?</hi> For whether or
no the World has been Created out
of nothing, is not material to our
purpose; Because if a supreme Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Agent has fram'd the World
to be what it is, and has made us to
be what we are, we ought as much
to stand in awe of it, as if it had
made both us and the World out of
nothing. Yet because this latter
Question ought not to be totally
pass'd by, I shall take the liberty to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
some Conceptions of mine upon it.</p>
            <p>The chief Argument used against
God Almighty's having Created the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56774:7"/>
World, is, That no Man can imagine
how a thing should be made out of
nothing; and that, therefore, it is
impossible, he should have made the
World, because there is nothing else,
out of which it could be made.</p>
            <p>First then, I cannot choose but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that to say, Because we are not
able to imagine how a thing should
be, therefore the being of that thing
must be impossible, is in it self a disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
way of Argumentation; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in those, who at the same time
declare they believe this World to be
Eternal, &amp; yet are as little able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how it should be Eternal, as
how it should be made out of nothing.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I conceive that
nothing can be properly said to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
any longer than it remains just
the same; for in the instant any part
of it is changed, that thing as it was
before, is no more in being.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56774:7"/>
            <p>In the third place, That every part
of this World we live in is changed
every moment; and by consequence,
that this whole World is so too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the whole is nothing else but
what is composed of every part; and
that therefore we cannot properly
say, this World has continued for
many Ages, but onely that all things
in this World have been changed for
several Years together.</p>
            <p>To evade which Opinion, those who
maintain the Eternity of the World,
are forc'd to say, That the Matter of it
is not changed, but the Accidents on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
though this be a sort of Argument
which they will not allow of in others.
For when it is by the <hi>Romanists</hi> urged,
in Defence of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the
Sacrament, <hi>That the Accidents of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
remain, though the Substance of it be
changed;</hi> they reject that as a ridiculous
Notion; and yet it is not one jot more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56774:8"/>
absurd to say, <hi>That the Accidents remain
when the Matter is chang'd, than that the
Matter remains when the Accidents are
changed;</hi> nay of the two, the Assertors
of this latter Opinion are the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
because they boldly attribute
it to a Natural Cause, whereas the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>
have the modesty at least to
own it for a Mysterious Miracle.</p>
            <p>But that the weakness of this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
of separating Accidents
from Bodies may the plainlier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
let us examine a little what the
meaning of the word Accident is.
Accident then does not signifie a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
distinct from Body or Matter, but
is only a Word, whereby we express
the several ways we consider of what
is in a Body, or matter that is before
us. For example; If we perceive a
Body to have length, then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of that length as an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of that Body; and when we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56774:8"/>
perceive a Body to have a Smell, or
Taste, then we consider of that Smell,
and that Taste, as Accidents of that
Body: But in none of these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we mean, that any thing can have
Length, or Smell, or Taste, but what
really is Body; and when any thing,
that had a Smell or Taste, has left off
to have a Smell or Taste, it is, because
that Part of it, which had a Smell or
Taste, is no more in it. So that, upon
an Examination of the whole Matter, I
am apt to believe, That there can be
naturally no change of Accidents, but
where there is a real change of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>But to proceed a little further, the
Question being, <hi>Whether it be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the World, or that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
has been from all Eternity?</hi> I
think, I may adventure to affirm, That
of two Propositions, the least probable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56774:9"/>
is that which comes nearest to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:
Now nothing can come
nearer to a Contradiction, Than Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or abiding the same for ever, and
a continued Changing, or not abiding
the same one moment: And therefore
I conclude, it is less probable, that this
Changeable World should have been
from all Eternity, than that some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Being, of more Excellence, and
greater Perfection, should be so, whose
very Nature is incapable of Change.</p>
            <p>That Being of more Excellence, and
greater Perfection, I call <hi>God;</hi> and
those, who out of a foolish aversion
they have for the <hi>Name of God,</hi> will
call it Nature, do not in any kind dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from this Notion of that Being, but
only change its Name, and rather
shew, they have a vain mistaken Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of being thought Atheists, than
that they have any Reason strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56774:9"/>
to Convince them to be so.</p>
            <p>The next Question I shall take into
Consideration, is this, <hi>Whether, though
there be a</hi> God, <hi>it is probable, that He
should take a more particular Care of
Mankind, than He does of Beasts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals?</hi> To which I have this
to offer, That though there are several
sorts of Animals, which give us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to imagine they have some kind of
Reason in them, though not to so great
a Perfection as Men have; yet since no
other Animal did ever any one thing,
that could give us the least cause to
believe, they have a Conception of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
World, or of a Deity; and that
no Man was ever yet born, but had
a Conception, or at least, a Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, more or less. I say, for this
Reason, it is probable, in my Opinion,
That there is something nearer a-kin
to the Nature of <hi>God</hi> in Men, than
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56774:10"/>
there is in any other Animals what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
and for that Reason, that
<hi>God Almighty</hi> does take a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Care of us, than He does of
them.</p>
            <p>If then <hi>God</hi> be Eternal, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
there is something in our Nature,
which is a-kin to the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> it
is also probable, That that Part of us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dies.</p>
            <p>It is also probable, That what by it
we are prompted most to value and
esteem, as the highest Perfections, good
Qualities, and Vertues, are Parts of the
Essence, and Nature of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, of all good Qualities, or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
it is Justice; which all Men do
most highly esteem and value in others,
though they have not all the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to practise it themselves. For Justice
is that good Quality, or Vertue, which
causes all other good Qualities or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56774:10"/>
to be esteemed; nay, it is that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
without which, all other Vertues
become as Vices; that is, they all come
to be abhorr'd.</p>
            <p>For he who wants Justice, and has
Wit, Judgment, or Valor, will for the
having Wit, Judgment, or Valor, be the
more abhorr'd; Because the more Wit,
Judgment, or Valor he has, if he
wants Justice, the more he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
become a Wicked Man: And he
who wants Justice, and has Power, will
for the having that Power, be the more
abhorr'd; Because the more Power he
has, if he wants Justice, the more he
will certainly become a Wicked Man:
And therefore, in my Opinion, it is a
very unreasonable thing for Men, out
of a Design of extolling <hi>God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>'s
Power, to rob Him of Justice; the
Quality without which, even Power it
self must necessarily be abhorr'd. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56774:11"/>
pray what can be more disrespectful
to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> Than to phansie
that he shall punish us for doing that,
which he has from all Eternity prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated;
that is, Compell'd us to do?
It is an Act that I can hardly believe
there ever yet was born a Man cruel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be guilty of, even in the depth
of his Revenge; And shall we make
that an Attribute of the Most Perfect,
and the Most High <hi>God,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the effect of the meanest of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in the worst of Men? It is, in my
Opinion, more reasonable to believe,
That <hi>God Almighty,</hi> out of his Love
to Mankind, has given us an Eternal
Soul; That an Eternal Being, and
Free-will, are things in their Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
one from the other; and that
therefore, according to our Actions,
proceeding from our Wills, <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi>
in Justice, will Reward and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56774:11"/>
Punish us in another World, for the
Good and Ill Deeds we perform in
this. I do not say, that the best of
our Actions here, are good enough to
make us deserve the utmost Joys of
Heaven; we must owe them to <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>'s
Grace and Favour, as indeed,
we owe all things else.</p>
            <p>Neither will I take upon me to guess
at the several Degrees of Joys there are
in Heaven. Our dull Sences, making
it as impossible for us to discourse well
of those things, as it is impossible for a
Man Born Blind, to talk well of Colours.
Nor will I pretend to judge how long,
or how much <hi>God Almighty</hi> will Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us hereafter; Because, for the
same Reason that we think him to be
a <hi>God</hi> of Justice, we must also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him to be a <hi>God</hi> of Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This only I do verily believe,</hi> That
the more we Love him, the more he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56774:12"/>
will Love us; and the less we Love him,
the worse it will be for us.</p>
            <p>Again, if this Instinct, or Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we have of a Deity, be the Ground
of our Religion, it ought also to be
the Guide of our Religion; That is,
if the strongest Reason we have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That <hi>God Almighty</hi> does take a
more particular Care of us, than He
does of other Animals, is, Because
there is something in our Nature, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
a-kin to the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> than
any thing that is in any other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal;
I say, in all Reason, that part of
us, which is nearest a-kin to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, ought to be our Guide
and Director, in Choosing the best
Way for our Religious Worship of
<hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is also this other Consequence,
which, in my Opinion, does naturally
depend upon what has been said; That
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56774:12"/>
one of the greatest Crimes a Man can
be guilty of, is, To force us to act or,
sin against that Instinct of Religion
which <hi>God Almighty</hi> has placed in our
Hearts; for, if that Instinct be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a-kin to the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> the
sinning against it must be somewhat
a-kin to the Sin against the <hi>Holy
Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then it be probable, that there is
a <hi>God,</hi> and that this <hi>God</hi> will Reward
and Punish us hereafter, for all the Good
and Ill things we act in this Life;
It does highly concern every Man, to
examine seriously, Which is the best
Way of Worshipping and Serving this
<hi>God;</hi> That is, Which is the best Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Now, if it be probable, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
which we have within us, of a
Deity, be a-kin to the Nature of <hi>God;</hi>
That Religion is probably the best,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56774:13"/>
whose Doctrine does most recommend
to us those Things, which, by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
we are prompted to believe are
Vertues, and good Qualities: And
that, I think, without exceeding the
Bounds of Modesty, I may take upon
me to affirm, Is the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>And for the same Reason, it does
also follow, That the Religion amongst
<hi>Christians,</hi> which does most recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to us Vertue, and a good Life,
is, in all probability, the best Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And here, I must leave every Man
to take pains, in seeking out, and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for himself; he only being answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to <hi>God Almighty</hi> for his own
Soul.</p>
            <p>I began this <hi>Discourse,</hi> as if I had
to do with those, who have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
at all: And now, addressing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56774:13"/>
my self to <hi>Christians,</hi> I hope, they
will not be offended at me, for end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with the Words of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ask, and it shall be given you; Seek,
and you shall find; Knock, and it shall be
opened unto you.</p>
            <p>I shall beg Leave farther, only to
propose a few Questions to all those,
in general, who are pleas'd to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whether there be any thing
more directly opposite to the Doctrine
and Practice of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> than to
use any kind of Force upon Men, in
Matters of Religion? And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Whether all those that practise it,
(let them be of what <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Sect,</hi>
they please) ought not justly to be call'd
<hi>Antichristians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56774:14"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether there can be any
thing more unmanly, more barbarous,
or more ridiculous, than to go about
to convince a Man's Judgment by any
thing, but by Reason? It is so ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that Boys at School are whipped
for it; who, instead of Answering an
Argument with Reason, are Logger-heads
enough to go to Cuffs.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the Practice
of it, has not always been ruinous and
destructive to those Countries, where it
has been used, either in Monarchies, or
Common-Wealths? And, Whether the
contrary Practice has not always been
successful to those Countries, where it
has been used, either in Monarchies,
or Common-Wealths?</p>
            <p>I shall Conclude, with giving them
this Friendly Advice; If they would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56774:14"/>
be thought Men of Reason, or of a
good Conscience, Let them endeavour,
by their good Counsel, and good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
to perswade others to lead such
Lives, as may save their Souls: And
not be perpetually quarrelling amongst
themselves, and cutting one another's
Throats, about those things, which they
all agree, are not absolutely necessary to
Salvation.</p>
