            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>I heard a merry gréeting:</l>
               <l>A pleasant toy, and full of ioy,</l>
               <l>two noble men were méeting.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And as they walked for to to sport,</l>
               <l>vpon a Summers day,</l>
               <l>Then with another nobleman</l>
               <l>they went to make a fray,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whose name was sir Iohn Barly corne,</l>
               <l>he dwelt downe in a dale:</l>
               <l>Who had a kinsman dwelt him nigh,</l>
               <l>they cal'd him Thomas Goodale.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Another named Richard Béere,</l>
               <l>was ready at that time:</l>
               <l>Another worthy Knight was there,</l>
               <l>cal'd sir William White Wine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some of them fought in a Iacke,</l>
               <l>some of them in a Can:</l>
               <l>But the chiefest in a blacke pot,</l>
               <l>like a worthy noble man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sir Iohn Barlycorne fought in a Boule,</l>
               <l>who woune the victorie:</l>
               <l>And made them all to fume and sweare,</l>
               <l>that Barlycorne should die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some said kill him, some said drowne,</l>
               <l>others wisht to hang him hie:</l>
               <l>For as many as follow Barly-corne,</l>
               <l>shall surely beggers die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then with a plough they plowed him vp</l>
               <l>and thus they did deuise,</l>
               <l>To burie him quicke within the earth,</l>
               <l>and swore he should no rise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With harrowes strong they combed him</l>
               <l>and burst clods on his head:</l>
               <l>A ioyfull banquet then was made,</l>
               <l>when Barly-corne was dead.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He rested still within the earth,</l>
               <l>till raine from skies did fall,</l>
               <l>Then he grew vp in branches gréene,</l>
               <l>which sore amaz'd them all,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And so grew vp till Mid-sommer,</l>
               <l>which made them all afeard;</l>
               <l>For he was sprouted vp on hie,</l>
               <l>and got a goodly beard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then he grew till S. <hi>Iames</hi> tide,</l>
               <l>his countenance was wan,</l>
               <l>For he was grewne vnto his strength.</l>
               <l>and thus became a man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With hookes and fickles kéene,</l>
               <l>into the field they hide,</l>
               <l>They cut his legs off by the knées,</l>
               <l>and made him wounds full wide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus bloodily they cut him downe</l>
               <l>from place where he did stand,</l>
               <l>And like a thiefe for treachery,</l>
               <l>they bound him in a band.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So then they tooke him vp againe,</l>
               <l>according to his kind:</l>
               <l>And packt him vp in seuerall stackes,</l>
               <l>to wither with the wind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And with a pitch-forke that was sharpe,</l>
               <l>they rent him to the heart,</l>
               <l>And like a thiefe for treason vile,</l>
               <l>they bound him in a cart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And tending him with weapons strong,</l>
               <l>vnto the towne they hie,</l>
               <l>And straight they mowed him in a mow</l>
               <l>and there they let him lie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then he lay groning by the wals,</l>
               <l>till all his wounds were sore,</l>
               <l>At length they tooke him vp againe,</l>
               <l>and cast him on the floore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They byred two with holly clubs,</l>
               <l>to beat on him at once,</l>
               <l>They thwacked so on Barly-corne,</l>
               <l>that flesh fell from the bones.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And then they tooke him vp againe,</l>
               <l>to fulfill womens minde</l>
               <l>They dusted and they sifted him,</l>
               <l>till he was almost blind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And then they knit him in a sacke,</l>
               <l>which grieued him full sore:</l>
               <l>They stéep'd him in a Fat, God wot,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

            <l>He said he would make Mault to creepe,</l>
            <l>But Mault made him the cat to whip.</l>
            <l>you neuer saw the like sir.</l>
            <l>The Glouer came to buy a skin,</l>
            <l>Mault hit him right aboue the chin,</l>
            <l>The pewter Iohn came doubling in,</l>
            <l>you neuer saw the like sir.</l>
            <l>And laid on head, armes, and ioynts,</l>
            <l>Tooke away his gloues, and grosse of points,</l>
            <l>And swore they had paid him in quartes and pints,</l>
            <l>you neuer saw the like sir.</l>
            <l>Thus of my song I will make an end,</l>
            <l>And pray my hostesse to be my friend,</l>
            <l>To giue me some drink now my mony is spend</l>
            <l>then Mault and I am quit sir.</l>
