            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) the foundation on which my iudgement encouraged my affection

admirable. Theſe are they which make vs men indeed, without which (as ſaith ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Seneca</hi>) men would be but <hi>maiuſculi pueri.</hi> O my Reader! let vs neuer aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don morality, vnleſſe we meane to baniſh all ciuility, and giue our ſelues ouer to ſenſuality. Neither let vs ſcorne theſe things, becauſe the Heathen writ them; for ſet the three ſupernaturall workes aſide, taught vs in our Creede, <hi>Creation, Redemption,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and tell me, good Reader, in what we excell them. In what goe we beyond them? nay, in what come we not ſhort of them?
<pb facs="tcp:18371:48"/>
Are we not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with their knowledge? doe we not ſee the whole life of a moderne ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpent onely to expound one of them? God grant that we (who haue receiued from them all their naturall helps, and in a higher degree haue beene diuinely taught from aboue by Truth, and Life it ſelfe all truth, and goodneſſe) be not found vnthankfull for thoſe humane gifts. If we proudly (vnder the pretence of learning diuinity) deſpiſe the ſtudies of humanity, we ſhall do like him that greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plucking a fruite, throwes away the leaues that both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, and defended it.

His carriage was ſo ſtrange and auſtere, and his life ſo voide of perturbation, that I wonder the ſuperſtitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his time did not adore him as a God, or (at leaſt) as a <hi>Semo.</hi> A Tubbe confined his body, but his minde the

I know not thy degree of admiration, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but I vow, that if <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> were now at <hi>Corinth</hi> with ioy to <hi>Corinth</hi> I would hie me, and kiſſe his feete. I had rather go thither to ſee him that hath the minde, then a furlong to ſee him that hath onely the fortune of a King.

They had many enteruiews, and therfore, no doubt, much conference; at all which hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gueſſed, ſome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I may haue bit. I confeſſe, <hi>Diogenes</hi> made it not, yet many things in it are his owne, and Posſibility ſaies they might haue beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Alexander.</hi> Suppoſe the Oration were mine own, I ſhould in this imitate no worſe a man then diuine <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who in moſt of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings makes <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeake for him; or <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who ſpeakes more then a little in the perſon of this olde <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke.</hi> Some things I haue borrowed of other <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>

which if thou happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to diſcouer, carpe not at it, but thank my iudgement, that for thee did ſelect them. Thinke not the Spider (which produceth a cobwebbe out of her owne body) better then the Bee which gathereth her hony abroade. Yet I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe to be of his minde, who held that a man ſhould haue ſomthing <hi>à ſe,</hi> as well as <hi>in ſe,</hi> and therefore haue not ſo much tyred my wit with tranſlation, as I haue refreſhed it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.

Though thou deny to ſtroke, I truſt thou wilt not ſtrike my Dogge, which neuer yet bit honeſt man.

I know there are Coltes who will venture to row in waters wherein (to vſe the ſeafaring phraſe) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue, that is; they will cenſure things they cannot ſee into; not vnlike to that German clowne, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to be very ready in the ten commandements, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by the Miniſter
