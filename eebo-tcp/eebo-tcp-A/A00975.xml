            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Now Affliction is nothing else (as wee know) but some evill and grievance pressing us either in body or soule, drawn in by sinne, and sent in by our just God; in generall, (as an Herald of Armes) to summon all men to lay downe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and come in by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:

                  </gap> these doth that holy <hi>Spirit</hi> reach forth unto us? Consider our estate, and their use. Wee are Travellers through this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of sinne, toward the heavenly Jerusalem, ignorant, and wandring, soone weary and faint. How usefull then,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15519:47"/>
how helpfull are all these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? The first is as an open Kings high-way to conduct us. The second is as a Guide, treading, and beating a path before us.

The fourth as cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full company, heartning &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing our drooping spirits, when our weake hearts begin to tyre, and those good wayes wax tedious to sinfull flesh. Let us now handle some of these particulars in severall.</p>
               <p>Surely, whatsoever comforts a wayfaring man could wish in his journy, are in these helps offered, and given him: The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first thing that a Traveller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, is a good way: oh when
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15519:47"/>
the wayes are first plaine, and easie, not hard to finde: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when they are cleane, not deepe and miery: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they are even; not mountaynous, and rocky: Fourthly, when they are strait, not crooked and winding, then are they accounted very good, and are no little helps &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to any Traveller: Nay, in such wayes we goe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with patience, but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>Thus the wayes of God in his Word,<note place="margin">Pro. 8.9.</note> are first <hi>plaine to him that understandeth</hi>: not onely a plaine way, but light too, in the way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. not like these earthly, but that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly way. For as that (<hi>via lactea</hi>) or milkey path, (as it is called) in heaven, which by

the infinite lights, stucke very thicke in it, embrightens it selfe:<note place="margin">Pro. 4.18.</note> so, <hi>the path of the just, is as the shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> Secondly, they are cleane and pure,<note place="margin">Psa, 19.8,9</note> 
                  <hi>very pure</hi> (<hi>Psa.</hi> 119.140.) not a spot of sinful mire in them; so farre from entangling, and encombring our feet, that they rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and quicken us. Thirdly, they are very even &amp; smooth, not stony and troublesome; <hi>Vallies filled, mountaines plained, and roughnesse smoothed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 3.5.</note> Very <hi>easie and light. Mat.</hi> 11. 30. no <hi>way grievous,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.3. nay, very pleasant, and <hi>sweet above the honey, and honey-combe.</hi>

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>And what marvell then, if they who have walked in those wayes, have beene wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delighted, and even ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in such paths?<note place="margin">Pro. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>They are wayes of pleasantnesse, and paths of peace,</hi> in which we finde all the rich treasures and jewels of wisedome, eternall life, and perfect blessednesse.</p>
               <p>A second comfort that a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> would wish in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, is a perfect Guide.

               <p>First, although our gracious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God hath by the light of his

Word as well discovered the way of life leading to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and cleared our eyes to discerne it, although hee hath given us the hystorie of his Saints as excellent Guides, to direct us, yet how dull and sluggish are we, how heavy in every good duty? <hi>How dull of hearing?</hi>

               <p>Now then when a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is cast downe in the sight of this his sinful corruption, how comfortable is that Ordinance of God (which hee knoweth to bee appointed, assisted, and sanctified by the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) as nayles, fastned and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven home, holding in, and keeping close his starting heart unto the feare of God, and not suffering it to warpe by this treacherous revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?

               <p>Againe, especially when wee consider the matter of these Sacraments, and nature of these seales; what rivers of comfort must needs flow into the heart of him who rightly partaketh them? Look
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15519:61"/>
as Princes grave their owne portraitures in their seales, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in state upon their Thrones, invested with their royall apparell, adorned with their Crownes and Scepters: So the Lord Jesus Christ in these his Signets hath lively represented himselfe in his death, conquering, triumphing and leading captive all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and even trampling them under our feete. But Princes can grave nothing on their seales but their dead I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: Not so here; For in these the very person of the Lord Jesus is given us, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely represented, but presented and exhibited to the faithfull. The body of Christ feeding and strengthning, the blood of Christ, washing, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15519:61"/>
(more than wine) cheering up our fainting spirits, is there offred and given us who reach out the hand of faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. Now how hee should be unhappy, who hath Christ, or misse of comfort, whose soule is filled with the Lord Jesus, it is not possible to conceive.</p>
               <p>But let us consider them a little severally.</p>
               <p>Baptisme is that Sacrament wherein God applyes the bloud of Christ to wash us from all the pollution of our sin, and to communi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>te unto us his own glorious purenes. Let us therefore take some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, first, as well of the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne, as our filthinesse by it, and then of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purenesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:15519:62"/>Certaine is it, that our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated understanding cannot find power in it selfe to conceive, much lesse words to expresse the infinite loathsomnesse of sinne. Hence is it that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the wisedome of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth it to all those things which are to our senses most abhorred: sinne to stinking mudde, a sinner to aswine wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in that mire: sinne to a loathsome vomit, a sinner to a dogge licking up his vomit: in a word, sinne to death, a sinner to a rotten carkasse, and his throat to an open Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, exhaling, and belching out stench and putrefaction: so infectious, that one sinne entring into the world, tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and slue the whole world with sinne, turning Saints into
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15519:62"/>
swine, Angels into Divels: so loathsome, that even both the materials of man,<note place="margin">Levit. 25.</note> in the very touch, defile; and the most pure and holy duties,<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 8.</note> passing through a sinfull heart, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abhorred, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable: It staineth the very righteousnesse of the Saints,<note place="margin">Esa. 64. 6.</note> (who are not on earth yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely clensed from it;) so that in it selfe it is no better than a filthy clout. This is our estate, from which by Christ (applied unto us in Baptisme) wee are delivered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ponder well what is this image of Christ, which Baptisme imprinteth upon us: It is even the Divine nature, that glorious beauty of holinesse, which, in God, the blessed Angels (above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

attributes) admire and prayse. <hi>Esa.</hi> 6.3. Surely, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing can be in God more excellent than other, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse is it: As the face is in the body, so is holinesse in the Lord, the very beauty of the Divine Nature. And as a passionate Lover is even ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the presence and sight of his beloved; so is it the compleate happinesse of the creature to behold that face of God shining with that ravishing bewty of holinesse. Men sweare by the greater,<note place="margin">Heb. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Psa. 89.35</note> Oh then how unspeakeable is the comfort of this holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15519:63"/>
which clensing us from such a filthinesse, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us into such a beauty.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Lords Supper is that holy Mysterie wherein the Spirit perfecteth this worke which hee hath begun in us, and throughly assures us Christ.</p>
               <p>Looke as when the wax is hard, the first impression chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the forme, and mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our Children aske of us things which are no way good, and sometimes they aske things that are good, but out of due time; wee give them neither: Thus often doe we, and therefore receive not. But fully to answer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, we must by no means forget, that in all petitions there is both a generall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purpose of asking good, and a desire of some particular, which we suppose to be good; but through our dulnesse in understanding, and want of a discerning Spirit, may bee good, or evill.

               <p>Now then, if the Lord should satisfie us in our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, granting the particular which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive to be good and he knoweth evill) and so should deny us the good which he knoweth we intend and purpose; this (under a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming grant) were a plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall; whereas the contrary seeming a deniall, yet is, (and wil hereafter plainly appeare to be) an evident grant, though not of that which wee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly aske, yet of that which in truth we desire.

               <p>NOw as that glorious one God is distinguished into three persons, so may we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne in Scripture a threefold relation betweene us, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry person; full of unspeakable joy and sweetnesse: God the Father vouchsafeth to bee our father; God the Sonne hath undertaken to be our Saviour; The blessed Spirit giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto us to be peculiarly, and in more specialty, our Comforter.</p>
               <p>First, then God the Father maybe considered in this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

either to God, or the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: In the first kinde he is a <hi>Father</hi> onely to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> by an essential communication of his substance. In the second, he is a Father either generally to all reasonable creatures, by creation; to Angels (<hi>Iob</hi> 1.6.) who are there called the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God:</hi>

               <p>Now indeed it is most true that howsoever these conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are most approved medicines, yet have they none or not their perfect operation, where either they are not wel and close applied, or (soone after this applying) are rubbed off with some tentation.

               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:15519:113"/>True it is, that the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and his Antichristian Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Teachers wrest, &amp; streine al their wits to perswade men that this assured knowledge of thir election, and salvation by ordinary means is a dangerous (nay so provdly peremptory are they without all warrant) a damnable doctrine, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging men to all presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, &amp; fleshly liberty.

                     <item>First, That the faithfull by ordinary revelations may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the certaine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perswasion of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, That it is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty to labour for it.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, That this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the gift of God, which every one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe not presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor so retaine, but that the sense of it sometimes may faile them.</item>
                     <item>And lastly, I will set downe some meanes whereby wee may secure our soules in this assurance of our happinesse, which is the Sunne of al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: First, then, that a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christian may by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without extraordinarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations (by visions, Angels,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:15519:115"/>
&amp;c.) bee fully assured of the life of grace already in his possession, and of glory cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reserved for him, will appeare, first, by divers cleare Testimonies of Gods word; secondly, by the examples of the Saints; thirdly, by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reason.</item>

               <p>FOr the evidence of this truth, consider that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9,10,11,12 <hi>verses</hi>

Lord hath given us his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to this very purpose, <hi>that we might know the things which are given us of God.</hi> Observe hence, that God doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preordaine his children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory, such as eye hath not seene, &amp;c. but by a second gift of his Spirit manifesteth this his decree unto them; which blessed Spirit openeth their eyes to discerne this grace bestowed, not on othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And how commeth this knowledge? by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelation? no; walking by faith, not by sight and sense.</p>
               <p>Lastly, not to be (as were very easie) too copious in a matter often cleared, see that testimony of another Apostle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> .3. 1, 2. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that wee
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:15519:118"/>
should be called the sonnes of God, &amp;c. Therefore the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are wee the sonnes of God, and it doth not yet appeare what we shall be, but wee know when hee shall appeare, wee shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Carefully attend the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Hee magnifies the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull love of God, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us out with joy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to take view of it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in two effects: 1. The glorious dignity to which he preferreth us; namely, To be his children: 2. The manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of this our happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, not indeed to the world (which thinketh us the most abject of creatures) but to our owne consciences, so that we
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15519:118"/>
now perceive our selves to be children, and though yet wee know not the parcels, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of that excellent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, untill wee come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, yet so much already we know, (not ghesse) that when Christ appeareth, wee <hi>shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with him in glorie, and be like unto him, by that beatificall vision of God, seeing him face to face.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Unto this practice of the Saints, let us annex some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the ancient Fathers in the Church, who, no doubt, spoke from their knowledge, and feeling. <hi>Hilar. in Mat. c.</hi> 5. <hi>The Lord will have us hope for

the kingdome of heaven without anie wavering of an inconstant will; Otherwise there is no justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, if faith it selfe be doubtfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Chrysostome in Rom. Hom.</hi> 9. <hi>We boast, or glorie</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>That thou maist know what minde he must have, who hath pledged his faith to God. For hee must not onelie have a full perswasion of those things which he hath received, but of those which are to come, as if alreadie given him; For a man glorieth of that which hee alreadie possesseth: Because, therefore, our hope is as firme of future things, as of present, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (saith he) <hi>we rejoice, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of these, as of the other.</hi> But to omit many other, verily that of <hi>Bernard,</hi> who lived in the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15519:122"/>
very darkenesse, and almost midnight of Popery, is not to be neglected. Thus he writes in <hi>Annunc. ser.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is necessary for thee first to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that thou canst have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne, but by Gods indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, &amp;c. Lastly, that thou canst not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>serve, by any workes, the kingdome of heaven, but that it also must be freely given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But these are not sufficient: they are but the beginnings and foundations of faith. If therefore thou beleevest that thy sinnes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forgiven, but by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom they are committed, thou dost well. But to this, adde yet further, that thou beleeve this also, namely, that thy sinnes by him are forgiven. This is the testimonie of the holy Spirit, who witnesseth unto our hearts, saying,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15519:122"/>
Thy sinnes are forgiven thee. Thus the Apostle determineth, that a man is justified by faith freely. So thou must also have the testimonie of the same Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Adde to these some reason for further confirmation, and so we will finish this point. It cannot bee denyed that true faith may ordinarily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, by infallible certainty, any promise which God hath revealed. For this is by all confessed to bee the very end of faith, that wee might bee certainely perswaded (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting) of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. But God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to every true Beleever eternall life (as cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed)
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15519:123"/>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.24. &amp;c. and hath many wayes confirmed his promise by oath, seales, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: hence it must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that the faithfull may bee infallibly assured of their salvation and glory.</p>
               <p>But some here object; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if men could surely know that they had true faith, then they might be surely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but how should they come to this knowledge? Certainly that we may attain this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; power of discerning our faith, is not only apparent by that sentence of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, exhorting the <hi>Corinthians to prove and examine their faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5</note> but by sense also, and every mans experience: when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve an able man promising mee any kindnesie, I know,

               <p>Now then in the next and last place, let us consider by what meanes a Christian may attaine this security, and finde his soule firmely instated and setled in it.</p>
               <p>Verily, as in the material, so is it in this spiritual building: hee that will build sure, must digge deepe, and casting out loose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mansion, must first fling out loose waverings of a distrustful heart, and doubtful appearances cast into his mind by Satan; and then lay his ground upon the Rocke, the sure and unmoveable promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God in Christ.</p>
               <p>I have often observed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the faithfull, strong in many graces, and in this only (to sight) weake, who have by the plaine evidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Word bin clearely convinced, that the Lord hath planted, and rooted the life of grace in their hearts, and so have beene (for the present) not a little cheered, aud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; yet after by some tentation to have bin whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disheartned, and cast downe againe in themselves from all

their joyes and consolations; concluding that all their religion was meere hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and themselves bare forms and images without life: This (I am perswaded) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds especially from want of a thorough-grounding their perswasions: much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense, and unsetlednesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them.</p>
               <p>Now then it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needefull and expedient, (as briefly as may bee) to set downe how farre the way of hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hee heard Iohn, and knowing him a just, and holy man, feared, and observed him; when hee heard him, did many things.</hi> So those hypocrites (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 30,31, 32.) <hi>come to the Word, as Gods people, sit there as the people of God, and call on others to the same dutie.</hi> Thus farre they seeme to hold way with the Saints; where doe they part? 1. In the ground, and end of this their frequent hearing: 2. In the effects and issues fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

their attendance.</p>
               <p>The ground, and end of hearing the Word, in an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, is sometimes his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall delight, when his lustfull eare is tickled with the soft eloquence, and sweet tongue of the Speaker, and his itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart clawed with carnall wisedome: Sometimes he is driven by the cryes of his yelping conscience: His best end is by further informing his understanding to set a faire glosse upon his profession, and that he may not sit as a mute, stand as a Cipher, when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion are in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and handling. But the faithfull soule, out of a deepe loathing of sinfull matter in himselfe, &amp; an unflaked hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst of righteousnes,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:15519:137"/>
knowing the word to be both the physicke of the soule, whereby it is throughly clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and the food, whereby it is nourished, presents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before the Ordinance of God, that hee may finde it Gods power to his salvation, in purging out all sinfull fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, and filling him with the fruits of righteousnesse. Thus are they described, <hi>Esa.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>They shall say, Come ye, and let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, and hee will teach us his wayes, and wee will walke in his paths.</hi> Where the faithfull plainly expresse their end of comming to God in his Word, not onely that it may be a light to teach, and point out the right way, but that it may give strength to their

feet, and enable them to walk in every good path?</p>
               <p>Secondly, they differ in the effect and fruit of hearing: For where the heart thus drawes neare to God, as that holy <hi>Cornelius, to heare (as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord) all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him</hi>:<note place="margin">Acts 10.33</note> the Word is a mighty weapon to beat down all strong holds,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 10. 4,5.</note> and every thing exalted against the knowledge of God, to bring every thought in obedience to Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

may keepe companie with the faithfull; where doe they break? 1. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an hypocrite is, at least in some points, meerely speculative, ann workes not upon the will, and affection to chose, and love the good which hee knowes. Much of Gods will hee knowes, and hates: as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Herod: I hate him a Prophet, indeed, of God,</hi>

the reprover. Contrary, the knowledge of the faithfull seasons the heart, drawes the will and affection, nay, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions also after it. 2. The difference in their joy is plain and palpable. For the formall mans joy ariseth not from the word, indeed, or any love to the truth of God, but from his owne fancies, and dreames falsly collected from the Word, witlesly, and wilfully (and therefore strongly) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his owne deceitfull hart. For when he hears mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; glory proclaimed to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon condition of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he builds a presumption of pardon &amp; salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon that sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy faith of divels; carnally, (as Papists at this day) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (&amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce raiseth up al his
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:15519:140"/>
that faith consisteth onely in the understanding, partly in an action of the apprehension, conceiving what is the object of faith, partly in an action of the judgement, consenting to it, and approving it as a truth of God: hee thinkes not of the maine and principall act of saving faith (without which the other profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) that action of the will letting al goe, and taking hold of Christ for salvation, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him as the supreme good and happinesse, and bringing him to his heart, whereby he is washed and purified. And hence blasphemously imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ to bee but as a cloake for his sinnes, he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly dreames of obtaining grace without any tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or change of the whole man.</p>
               <p>Hence the promises of God, thus by himselfe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are welcome, and a false joy followes a false hope. But the command of God, much more the threatning word, and reproofe for breach of the command, is grievous to him, and insupportable; hated as cords, as bonds, as death, and the very Crosse.

               <p>See this exemplified in that noted hypocrite, <hi>Herod.</hi> The preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> (<hi>as of Christ and all his Messengers, Mar.</hi> 1. 14, 15.) consisted of two maine points, Repent, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. <hi>Repent, for the kingdome of God is at hand:</hi>

Now it is easie to finde what, in the preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> this incestuous beast hard so gladly.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:15519:141"/>

               <p>Most unlike is the joy of the faithfull hearer, who loves the Word with a most entire, unexpressible affection: <hi>Oh how I love thy Word,</hi>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:15519:144"/>
1. The Dissembler is very hot in some particulars, which concerne Gods glory, but hath his owne ends in them all, and therefore when those ends faile, is as cold in other things, which are as, or more needful than the former. How zealous was <hi>Iehu</hi> against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs Idols?</hi> He rooted out the <hi>Baalims.</hi> Not so much warme against <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Idols, but served the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Bethel</hi>; whereby hee plainly uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his dissembling heart, and manifested his hypocrisie to every eye.</p>

Yes verily: For the faithfull soule, in the day peace, continues still as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dearely to esteeme the Lord Jesus, even after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: when he heares the blessed Spirit speaking peace to him,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> then <hi>hee esteemes all things dung and losse in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the knowledge of Christ.</hi> Here the hypocrite lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him.

as medicine onely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in extremity of paine, when he is sicke at heart, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil he not send for him? and though the pocion and prescription be grievous, yet then it is forced down, though hee send it up againe: but as soone as he is a little cheered, he loathes his Physicke: The other knowes him to bee as well his meate as medicine, and therefore in health (when he findes his heart assured of salvation) longues, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for him and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>

               <p>NOw then, seeing we know how farre an hypocrite may seeme to goe in the good way, let us proceed to remove that wavering which beares downe many a weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in a very painfull &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable estate. I find two especiall temptations, applied by Satan, to shake the faith of a weake soule, and to hold it in suspence, that it cannot rise up to any strong consolation in the sense and feeling of Gods grace &amp; favor. The first and chiefe is, that whatsoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey do, is done in hypocrisie.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15519:148"/>
True it is, they can heare the Word, they can frequent the assemblies, reverence the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Teachers of it, invite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the fellowship of the same grace, rejoyce in the Word, but all this (saith the Tempter, and truly) may bee in an hypocrite, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they thinke it is all no better than dissembling. They have some zeale (they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) to the truth, but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall zeale; some desire and longing after Christ, but hypocriticall; all is meere hypocrisie. Thus they say, thus they thinke.</p>
               <p>Now let such a Christian, 1. seriously consider, that the subtle Serpent doth not onely tempt men to presumption, but also to distrust; as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15519:148"/>
in those assaults, by which he set upon our blessed Saviour: As hee allures him to a presumptuous casting himselfe downe from the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Temple, because the Angels waited on him to lift, and beare him up; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he laboureth to draw him to a distrust of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and therefore <hi>(as the sonne of God) to command the stones to be made bread:</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 3. 6. And as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and carelesse world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the most ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon whom hee workes grosse, presumptuous dreams of salvation; (those hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades, God is mercifull, Christ came to save all men, and therefore when he heares the word of the curse, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:15519:149"/>
him, from these grounds, to blesse himselfe in his heart, saying, <hi>I shall have peace, though I walke after the stubbornnesse of mine owne heart, adding drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse to thirst</hi>; thus he rocks him in a dead sleep of sinne.) As thus he workes grosse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions upon the carelesse and blinde professour, so hee never pursues any with those weapons of distrustfull, and unbeleeving feares, but those who are either quite gone, or now going, or at least setting their faces to goe out of his AEgypt, in travell toward the heavenly Canaan.</p>
               <p>So then when hee assaults thee with this weapon, know assuredly that Satan plainely discerns that God hath wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and raised thy soule from
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:15519:149"/>
that drowsie cradle of sinne, in which hee so long had lulled thee in deep security. Againe, remember thy corrupt heart is very deceitfull, not onely to hide up sinne in it, and to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee with faire, but false hopes, and so to breede pride, and presumption; but as cunning also to conceale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grace which is in it, and so to affright thee with likely, but false feares: It will bee then a necessary point of wisedome not to give full, and rash credite to either hope, or feare, but diligently to weigh thy estate in that ballance of the Word, which is the truth, and cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee: First then (hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thy soule by prayer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:15519:150"/>
that he will not so be tyed to it, but that in some things he will use his owne liberty.</p>
               <p>Againe, both a sound, and rotten heart rejoyce in the Word: But thou findest love to the word, not in thy mouth as the dissembler, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. when indeede his soule hates it, (at least some part of it) but in thy heart. <hi>He receives not the love of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10. and therefore rejoyces not in the truth of God, but in the lyes of Satan, promising life without reformation: but thou out of love to the Word, even because it is a purifying word, rejoycest in it, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that power of it, whereby thy soule is washed, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from thine owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

               <p>Lastly, the hypocrite can thirst for Christ at sometimes, when he is in the furnace, as iron, his heart for the present is softned, but as soone as it is out of the fiery triall, returnes to his hardnesse, and indeed was onely troubled, never changed. But thou findest a deepe, and unquenched thirst of Christ and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ever burning in thy soule; so that even in the dayes of peace thy heart is ever sighing after him, and esteemest him as the onely
