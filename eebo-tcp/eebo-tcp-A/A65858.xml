            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>in their late Defaming, Confused Book, falsly stiled, Antichrist in Spirit Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd.</hi> I did near the Conclusion of the said Treatise seriously enquire only of <hi>William Alcott</hi> and <hi>Henry Loader,</hi> in these four Questions following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43101:3"/>I. <q>Was <hi>Edward Paye</hi> Deputed and approved by your Congregation, or any Select Assembly of Elders or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninisters of the Baptized People or Churches, to Write and Publish his said Book against the People called Quakers, or did he do it on his own Authority and Head, with your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation only?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <q>What Ministers or Elders of your Churches, besides your selves, did peruse and approve of <hi>Edward Paye</hi>'s said Book, before printed, and of the Printing thereof, to Defame us as a People?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <q>Is the said <hi>Edward Paye,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed esteem'd among you and your Society a good Christian, a Person of a Godly and Sober Conversation, of Sound Judgment, Piety and Parts, meet to manage Matters of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy about Religion?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <q>Do you intend to stand by him the said <hi>Edward Paye</hi> in all Matters that he has written, in Charge, both against certain Persons and against the People called Quakers, in his Book?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having also given my Reasons for these Questions in the said Treatise, <hi>Antichrist in Flesh,</hi> p. 26. Now let it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43101:3"/>
be observ'd, that to these Questions I find no answer from the said <hi>William Allcot</hi> or <hi>Henry Loader,</hi> to whom they were put; but a pretended and evasive Answer from <hi>Edward Paye</hi> himself, having <hi>only</hi> his own Name subscribed a few Lines after, but no <hi>William Allcot</hi> nor <hi>Henry Loader</hi> subscribed thereto, but <hi>Edward Paye</hi> left to shift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and they slunk back, for all they highly commended his Work and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed us in their Commendatory Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to his other Pamphlet (<hi>i. e. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in Spirit</hi>) against us. And yet as if he had a Plurality of Advocates to answer for him, he gives us his slim Answer in the Plural thus, <hi>viz. We will give an answer to</hi> G. W's <hi>impertinent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, though I think they are not worth taking notice of: His Questions are four, but his Reasons for asking them vanish in answering the first.</hi>—And in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Answer it is said, E. P. <hi>did Write and Publish his Book by the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the majority of this Congregation; and so he did not do it on his own Head; neither did we see it needful to desire the Approbation of others herein, though seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have approved of it since,</hi> p. 37, 38. But what <hi>We</hi> are these give this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer besides <hi>Edward Paye?</hi> we find no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43101:4"/>
Body's Name else to it but his own: If by [<hi>WE will give an Answer; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did we see it needful to desire the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others</hi>] be meant <hi>William Allcot</hi> and <hi>Henry Loader</hi>; why did they not put their Names to it? Why do they now shrink back and decline their Brother in his Work, seeing the Enquiry was so fairly made of them? Can they or <hi>Edward Paye</hi> either reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably suppose, that we (as a People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed and injured by <hi>E. P.</hi>) will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his own Answer or Justification of his perverse Work, and himself too, and believe that he says true, in saying, <hi>That he did Write and Publish his said Book by the Approbation of the majority of their Congregation at</hi> Deptford? For my Part I do not believe him herein; in Point of Charity I do not suppose the majority of the Congregation or Hearers of the Baptists at <hi>Deptford</hi> are so grossly corrupted and deluded into Envy and Prejudice as really to believe and approve of such a Bundle of Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Numerous Slanders, Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Notorious Lyes, Perversions and Abuses as are contain'd and apparent in the said Pamphlet, styl'd, <hi>Antichrist in Spirit,</hi> by <hi>Edward Paye</hi> (and many of them repeated in his second) and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43101:4"/>
highly approved by <hi>William Allcott</hi> and <hi>Henry Loader</hi>: But if either the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or minority of their Congregation have given their Approbation for the Writing and Publication thereof (as is pretended) I and others of us should be very sorry for their sakes, that they should be so miserably deluded, as not only to believe, but approve of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of such gross Slanders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations against their Innocent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as are contained in the said Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet: And that they should be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and blindly credulous of such gross and notorious Falshoods and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, invented by envious Persons and Persecutors. And you <hi>E. P. W. A.</hi> and <hi>H. L.</hi> who have so far deluded any of your Hearers, have much to answer for, and a sad account to give, before the Righteous Judge of all.</p>
            <p>But now, seeing the Writing and Publication of <hi>E. P</hi>'s said Envious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet (<hi>i. e. Antichrist in Spirit</hi>) is at last so far dedicated to the <hi>majority</hi> of the Baptist's Congregation at <hi>Deptford,</hi> as having their Approbation, it may not be unseasonable to shew them and others some of <hi>Edward Paye</hi>'s and <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Allcot</hi>'s notorious <hi>Falshoods, Slanders</hi> and <hi>Perversions</hi> contained therein; and

            <p>We do in the Name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ utterly deny this Passage and Declaration, as laid down in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Name and Person, as no Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Speech made or thus declarable by the Quakers, on their Principle, but a <hi>Horrid Abusive Forgery</hi> of <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> long since detected, and which you Baptists now may be horribly asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring forth, or suffer to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Print.</p>

            <p>But I know no Bok of <hi>James Parnell</hi>'s so entituled upon the Reviewing the Titles of his Books, nor any of the rest quoted, that oppose or disown God's Omnipresence; much less that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called Quakers are guilty of any such Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43101:8"/>I would desire <hi>E.

That if it shall appear that any of them have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or denyed the Omnipresence of God or his Eternal Spirit, we may shew our dislike thereof.</p>
            <p>But, I believe, there's enough in our Friends Books to clear them, if honestly viewed and cited, and we have great cause to Question, and detect his unfair Citations, as I have this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Instance against my self; for Proof of his said Charge 8.

            <p>Is it not a great Shame and Reproach to Religion, that any Preachers should be so Credulous and Envious as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such down-right Lyes and gross Perversions, to Reproach their quiet Neighbours, and thus confidently to Expose them to the World, as these Anabaptist Preachers have done; and thereupon to roar out and cry, <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Absurdities, Gross Contradictions to Truth?</hi> p. 43.

            <p>Whereas Christ hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given him, and he is our Saviour and Redeemer, and as he had Power to lay down his Life and take it up again, so his own Seed of Life, Word or Plant in the Soul (though for a Time under Suffering and the Load of Man's Iniquity) he hath Power to

Raise it up, and therein to bring forth an Immortal Birth and Holy Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is <hi>his Seed,</hi> whom he shall see as the Fruit of his Soul's Travel.

            <p>We never Entertained or Believed any such Doctrine as these Adversaries enviously and falsly insinuate, as that the <hi>Seed Christ</hi> ONLY <hi>wants Redemption</hi>; for so to render him Impotent, were to oppose his All-sufficient Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

but that 'tis the <hi>Soul of Fallen Man and Woman, that wants Redemption,</hi> and not Christ, who is the Redeemer and Saviour of it; this does plainly appear to be our Belief, from our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Nature and Being of the <hi>Soul of Man</hi> as a Creature, and not the Creator, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul of the Creature Man is not God nor Christ, <q>But the Spiritual <hi>Being</hi> and Principal Part of Man, Created in the Image of God, and Divinely Inspired and Enlightned by its Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who formed the Spirit (or Soul) of Man within him; for the Soul or Spirit of Man, as distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Body, is often in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rendred one and the same thing, more livingly perceived and felt in that Divine Light and Life of Christ, whereby our Souls live to God, than by any Philosophical or School Definitions.</q>

            <p>E. P. <hi>Which way could the Quakers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to escape being defamed or discredited? Why, it's like they did suppose, That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Assembly of Parliament had Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greater Moment, in Hand, than to compare their former Writings with their new Faith: So that if we had not concerned our selves to peep into their Writings, and compare them with their newly-professed Faith, and published this to the World, namely, That the Quakers former Writings and their late Profession of Faith, are as really alike

            <p>To the first I answer, We never denyed the Scriptures to contain the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>True Sayings of God,</hi> whereas Christ is <hi>the Word,</hi> his Name is called <hi>the Word of God,</hi> Rev. 19.9, 13.

In that we cannot so call them, he must excuse us herein, until he produce us Plain Scripture, that SO calls them, though the Holy Scriptures be a Rule of Doctrine subordinate to that Spirit from whence they first came. But seeing it is an Article of his Faith, <hi>That the Scriptures are the only Rule of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. He had need to produce plain Scripture, that SO saith; otherwise his Failure therein will be an Indication, That the Scriptures are not the only Rule of his Faith, because there wants Scripture Proof of this great Article of his Faith; and then where's his Faith?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Truly I never knew the Quakers affirm the Scriptures to be of NO Use in order to the true Knowledg of God, but that the Holy Scriptures are very useful, with the help of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43101:21"/>3. I never knew the Quakers hold it a Sin, much less of Idolatry, to take the Practices of the Saints, Recorded, Commanded and Continuing Commands in Force in the Scriptures, for our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and <hi>Rules,</hi> because the Spirit of Truth, which is our chief Guide and Rule, does not lead to Reject, but to Own and Follow its own Precepts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which are in Force in Scripture.</p>

I have not known it asserted by our Friends, That <hi>whatever</hi> is commanded in Scripture is no Duty to us, except we receive the Command by immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, as the Prophets and Apostles did; for something commanded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is, and may be, truly in it self a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for all, but cannot be truly understood nor performed without the Assistance and Guidance of the Holy Spirit; and that Spirit will not be wanting to assist in both, as truly heeded.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I never knew our Friends, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers (so called) deny the Resurrection of the Just and Unjust, though probably your gross Sense thereof; but we have only pleaded for the Spiritual, Celestial and Glorious Bodies in the Resurrection, as far excelling the Natural, Earthly and Corruptible Bodies, and sincerely believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures in that Case,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43101:21"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35, 36. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Hosea</hi> 13.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I never knew our Friends (the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) deny the Body of Christ, that suffered, to be raised from the Grave or Sepulchre, but divers declare their Belief to the contrary; namely, <hi>That his Flesh saw no Corruption</hi> (or did not Corrupt) but rose again the Third Day; and that Christ in the same Body Ascended into Heaven; yea also, that he ascended far above <hi>All</hi> Heavens, that he might fill all things.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to that Point of your Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and your Bread and Wine, you must excuse us, we are not yet satisfied that they are <hi>Gospel-Ordinances,</hi> and to continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Force, under the Gospel and New Covenant-Dispensation, being a Dispensation of Substance, and not of Shadows; nor do we believe that you Baptists have any immediate Call from Heaven to Baptize People in Water, nor that your observing Breaking of Bread or Drinking of Wine can properly be called the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> either in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or in the Substance; yet we do not Despise or Contemn either <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> or <hi>Breaking of Bread</hi> (as we are falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused) as once practised, nor as observed by such now as are Conscientious therein,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43101:22"/>
from a Belief that 'tis their Duty to observe the same, we charitably think, they mean well therein, but wish they might more mind and partake of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, both as to the Spiritual Baptism and the Bread of Life from Heaven, for their poor Souls Relief, and Safety in Christ the Substance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We never held that pernicious Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, of Believing, <hi>That no Blessedness is to be enjoyed by the Saints after Death,</hi> as is most unjustly insinuated against us, from Suggestions grossly false, p. 9. and elswhere detected.</p>
            <p n="9">9. We never denyed Justification by Christ's Works, Righteousness and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, much less call <hi>it</hi> a Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as we are most horridly belied, p. 9. as is clearly evinced.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We are not ashamed to say, and affirm, That Christ is the Light of the World, and that he is that True Light that enlightens every Man coming into the World, and that God is our Light and our Salvation; and is not this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light <hi>within,</hi> think ye? Doth not both God and Christ, in some degree, appear within, to be known within, suppose ye? else how should that which may be known of God be manifest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, seeing there's no knowledg of God but by Christ?</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:43101:22"/>11. And as to <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Complements charg'd, and for Moderate and Mild Treatment of our Antagonists. The truth on't is, the former I like not, but the latter: I am truly for Moderation and Mildness, even in treating Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, if they are any whit Treatable, Rational or Fair Opponents. But if I find an opposing Adversary guilty of Envy, Lying, Forgeries, gross Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Wresting and Turning my Words to a contrary Sense than they naturally import or ever was intended by me, then I hope I may tell and shew him his evil and injurious Work, and justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him for the same, and yet I not be justly deem'd guilty of <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Complements, or Rhetorick either; for I can make no better of a gross Lye or Forgery than 'tis, nor give it a better Character than it deserves, or that lying Spirit from whence it comes, which I have plentifully met with in <hi>Edw. Paye</hi>'s Works of Envy against us, for which I think he justly deserves to be paid off by just Reprehension. And of his <hi>mild Treatment</hi> you may hear anon.</p>
            <p>To excuse his envious and scornful Story from our Persecuting Adversaries, the <hi>Westmorland</hi> Petitioners about <hi>Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> cited in his other Pamphlet against
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43101:23"/>
the Meetings of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> p. 7, 8. <hi>Antichrist in Spirit.</hi> Now <hi>E. P.</hi> saith, <hi>viz. For my part, I have seen them Quake and Foam at the Mouth, besides several that have been Eye and Ear-Witnesses of it,</hi> Railings, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>But neither tells us the Persons, nor in what Meeting or what Place he saw them in both those Postures, nor who else, besides himself, were the Eye and Ear-Witnesses thereof: And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have we to believe his Testimony any more in this than in many other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Falshoods?</p>
            <p>And <hi>Corrupt Notions and Deceivable Gestures,</hi> p. 11. he hath not proved against us. But instead of Proof, is now fain to beg Questions, and come to his Supposition, <hi>viz. Suppose you formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Quake, Tremble, Roar, Swell and Foam at the</hi> Bull and Mouth <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>the</hi> Westmorland <hi>Petitioners may say true,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>See how faintly he comes off, for those <hi>Westmorland</hi> Petitioners and their Story, to render us odious. As for Quaking and Trembling, I ask him, If these be the <hi>Deceivable Gestures</hi> which he accuseth us of? And as to <hi>Roaring, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Foaming,</hi> which he would fain Insinuate against us, I neither know nor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43101:23"/>
remember these Gestures among our Friends at the <hi>Bull and Mouth</hi> Meeting, or elsewhere in <hi>London,</hi> ever since I knew the Meeting in that place, which has been above 34 Years. <hi>E. P.</hi> grants, <hi>Christ present in Spirit,</hi> but the reason of <hi>Fasting; his being personally taken from them into the glorious Heavens above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Stars, and they obliged to Prayer and Fasting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till his second personal Coming,</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>Whereas Christ assigned another cause of Prayer and Fasting, even when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally present with his Disciples for the casting out the unclean Spirit, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.29. and the Apostles approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Ministers in <hi>Watchings,</hi> in <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> by <hi>Pureness,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5. was not because of Christ's personal or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward absence. And as for your being <hi>obliged to Prayer and Fasting, 'till Christ's second personal coming,</hi> I do not believe you'l fast so long: G. W. <hi>denies not Quaking and Trembling,</hi> (quoth <hi>E. P.</hi>) p. 16. And what then? Was that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the <hi>Westmorland</hi> Petitioners were brought for? Does that prove, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sorcery, or a Diabolical Spirit, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or Foamings in our Meetings,</hi> (as they insinuated) <hi>or deceivable Gestures,</hi> as he has accused us?

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. E. P. <hi>I have, it's true, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the</hi> Quakers <hi>Appeal, by way of Charge, against</hi> Tho. Hicks, <hi>wherein they charge him with Lies and Slanders and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries. —And I have perused Mr.</hi> Hicks<hi>'s Answer to their Appeal, where Mr.</hi> Hicks <hi>clears himself both of Lies and Forgery. I find his Answer to their Appeal subscribed by no less than</hi> 22 <hi>Persons of Credit, who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie they have Compared</hi> Tho. Hicks <hi>his Citations with the</hi> Quakers <hi>Books, out of which they were taken, and find them truly cited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>Edw. Paye,</hi> in Vindication of his Brother <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> to regain his long since lost Reputation. Which I did not think any of the <hi>Baptists</hi> would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to defend at this time aday, especially since he was so publickly and often detected of many Gross and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Forgeries; Besides those few Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages wherein he pretended to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as his 22 Witnesses also attempted, who were of his own Party, and willing to cover him what they could; but all would not do, they did but thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and defile themselves, as we made it plainly appear in a small Treatise,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43101:24"/>
Entituled, <hi>The second Treatise wherein the Forgers, Compurgators are Impeached, in a strict Examination of divers Citations and doctrinal Matters, in their Book, Entituled,</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> Appeal Answered. In which Impeachment they are proved both Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair and False Witnesses, as well as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Judges, even in Matter of Fact, as to Citations. But of this Treatise <hi>E. Paye</hi> takes no notice; but is willing to credit and vindicate his Brother <hi>Hicks,</hi> 1. Upon his own Testimony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is Witness only for himself in his own Cause. 2. Upon the Credit of his 22 Compurgators, who were of his own Party, and willing to say as he would have them, for a cover to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; whereby they got no good, but shame and disgrace, as is clearly evinced in the said <hi>Second Treatise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And many of the said <hi>Hicks</hi> his deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Forgeries are discovered both in our Friends Narratives of the Two Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the <hi>Baptists,</hi> in 1674. And also in our Answers to <hi>Hicks,</hi> one Entituled, <hi>The Counterfeit Christian,</hi> and the other, <hi>Reason against Railing.</hi> With more Books, wherein his Deceits, Forgeries and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are detected. And therefore the more shame for <hi>E. P.</hi> thus to credit and justifie <hi>Hicks,</hi> as he has done, whom we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43101:25"/>
well knew to be a very Envious Person, and so seems this <hi>Paye</hi> very much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him therein, by espousing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Lies as he has done, and now has the more pull'd an old House about his Ears, by owning <hi>Hicks</hi> and his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick, Fictitious Dialogues, so much as he has done; so that now <hi>E. P.</hi> is the more bound to stand or fall by <hi>Hicks</hi> his Dialogues, seeing he has so cordially e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused his Interest. And by <hi>E. P.</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Writing against the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> we may charge all the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> and their Society with <hi>Hicks</hi> his Dialogues and <hi>E. Paye</hi>'s disingenuous ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pamphlets: But some among them, wiser than himself, should consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Method may be safe or reputable for them.</p>
            <p>His crediting and quoting <hi>Hicks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, who was a bitter and virulent Adversary, is somewhat like his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s confuted Book, stiled, <hi>Quakerism no Christianity,</hi> to support his scurrilous Story from the <hi>Westmorland</hi> Petitioners, <hi>viz.</hi> That Mr. <hi>J. Faldo</hi> saith, <hi>How generally were their Meetings (viz.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>either silent or taken up with sudden and violent Eruptions of dismal Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and horrid Ravings, Persons suddenly taken as with the Falling sickness, Shaking
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43101:25"/>
and Foaming at the Mouth, and some lying flat on the Ground, as if stark dead?</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>Here's a long Question, containing strange Stories, but never the truer for his Mr. <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s mis-insinuating them by way of Question, neither are Questions Proofs. But we who have known our Meetings and the Manner of them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, do know it to be a great untruth. That they were generally taken up with those sudden and violent Eruptions (or Breakings out) mentioned, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times <hi>silent,</hi> we grant, which is a far different posture from <hi>horrid Ravings, dismal Howlings, Foamings,</hi> &amp;c. But how does your <hi>John Faldo</hi> make out his Story? <hi>E. P.</hi> tells us, <hi>viz. And, saith Mr.</hi> Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, <hi>some</hi> Such <hi>things as these I have seen and heard.</hi> Which is short of proving <hi>these</hi> things, according to his general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation against our Meetings; <hi>some such things as these,</hi> are not <hi>the same things:</hi> Then, How poorly does <hi>E. P.</hi> come off against us herein? Yet fain thus to fly to our Adversaries Books for such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges, lame Proofs against our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>But would the <hi>Baptists</hi> be so serv'd? would they take it well to have Books made out of their Adversaries against
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43101:26"/>
them? Whereof I could instance not only that stiled, <hi>The Anabaptist wash'd and wash'd, and shrunk in the washing,</hi> long since writ by <hi>Rich. Carpenter, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi> (probably as much a friend to the People called <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> as <hi>John Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> was to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or them either) and many others of their Adversaries Books against them (as <hi>E. P.</hi> has done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us) which I presume these <hi>Baptists</hi> now would not take well, nor accept as proof against them; so that in suffering <hi>E. P.</hi> in such his credulous and unfair Dealing, thus to gallop on against us, surely they would not be so dealt by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E. P.</hi>'s Story, accusing the <hi>Quakers</hi> out of <hi>Hicks's Dialog.</hi> 1. Pag. 24, 25. with saying, <hi>as for us, had the Scriptures never been, we could have known what is therein contained. This</hi> (E. P. saith) <hi>he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so heard from their</hi> own Mouths, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in Spirit,</hi> p. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>But in the Name and Behalf of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> I deny both <hi>Hick</hi>'s and <hi>Paye</hi>'s Accusation; and that <hi>he hath heard this from</hi> their <hi>Mouths.</hi> This I look on as a Lie of his own making, my self and many thousands never spoke those words, nor so believed, <hi>viz.</hi> that we <hi>could</hi> have known <hi>what</hi> (i. e. or <hi>whatever
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43101:26"/>
all)</hi> that is therein contained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we disown the Expressions, as they relate to our selves. And <hi>E. P.</hi> has varied and fallen from his own Testimony as 'tis general against the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Now to tell us, <hi>He has heard it from a</hi> Quaker <hi>himself,</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 18. of his <hi>Railings and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>: So in one Book 'tis thus, <hi>I have also heard from</hi> their <hi>own Mouths.</hi> In his other Book, 'tis, <hi>I have also heard this from a</hi> Quaker <hi>my self.</hi> Thus the Man faulters and varies in his own Evidence to defend a <hi>Falshood.</hi> And his unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Questions (or rather Challenge) he pretends to be grounded on the said (false) Story against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they are as impertinent and insincere on his part, namely, to <hi>resolve him</hi> what <hi>those things were that Jesus did, that are not written,</hi> Joh. 20.25. <hi>or what were the the Contents of that Writing on the Ground,</hi> Joh. 8.6, 8. <hi>or else let their proud boasting of Immediate Inspirations be condemned to perpetual silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a sad Sentence, both unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and unjustly deduced from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position made altogether in a disbelief and contempt of the Matter proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> To resolve all those other unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten things that Jesus did, <hi>&amp;c. by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43101:27"/>
Inspiration.</hi> But now the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge is altered, and abated too, <hi>Now let him resolve me in</hi> some <hi>of those things that Jesus did, that was not written, and what was wrote on the ground, and let him or any other</hi> Quaker <hi>do it either by a Mediate or Immediate Inspiration, or Revelation,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>And what follows? If by neither of these ways we can resolve him, then not to pretend to Immediate Inspiration. And yet he himself pretends to <hi>Mediate</hi> or more Common Gifts <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> and then confusedly tells of <hi>the use of these more immediate or common Gifts,</hi> p. 19, 20. And yet by these his pretended more immediate or common Gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or rather mediate Gifts, in his sense, I presume he cannot resolve himself his Two Questions before, nor can he upon his own Principle either resolve them or be resolved them, either by any <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> or <hi>immediate Gifts.</hi> For the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,</hi> he has disclaimed, <hi>he needs it not,</hi> (he says) but pretends the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Only Rule of Faith.</hi> By what Rule then should he be resolved what those or any of those other things were that are not written? <hi>John</hi> 20.25. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has insincerely and temptingly imposed unlearned Questions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43101:27"/>
which he does not believe can be resolved to his conviction or satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and thereupon has past unjust Judgment against our having <hi>immediate Inspiration</hi>; &amp; yet in contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, tells us of <hi>common and more immediate Gifts and Graces of the Spirit,</hi> and of the <hi>use of these more immediate or common Gifts to help our Infirmities, p.</hi> 19, 20. Altho I presume he would be loath to have his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Condemnation against us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd upon himself, on the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For 'tis certain, <hi>he that has not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his.</hi> And what are these more <hi>immediate</hi> Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit he pretends to the use of, seeing he and his Brethren pretend not to <hi>immediate</hi> (or extraordinary) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations,</hi> p. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>There's another Contradiction in the Case, to prove their <hi>Call to Baptize Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Water.</hi> (He saith) <hi>they have a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Call for it from the Commission of Christ our Great Prophet, who is to be heard in all things,</hi> Matth. 28. Mark 16. <hi>and the frequent Examples of his Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that we need not immediate Inspirations for our Call or Authority herein,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Which is to tell us, you may take upon you to be Preachers and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizers in Water, without being inspired
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43101:28"/>
by Christ, because he gave a Commission to his Disciples to teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>into the Name</hi> of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. But, 1. This is no proof, that you are called by Christ to either. 2. Here's no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mention'd in the Commission. 3. And to baptize <hi>into</hi> that Name, is a work of the Spirit attending a living and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ministry, given and authorized by Christ himself, which this proves not yours to be, no more, than that the false Prophets were true and truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated, because they said, <hi>thus saith the Lord</hi>; when yet God never spoke to them no more than Christ hath spoke to you to Preach and Baptize with Water; when as you do both without his <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Inspiration, Commission, or Spirit</hi>; and consequently you do not hear him in all things. 4. Neither does it follow, that you hear Christ, because you Preach and Baptize People in Water, by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, whom he sent to Preach and Convert People by his Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did Minister. 5. You might as well argue, that because <hi>Peter, James, John,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. were Apostles and Ministers of Christ, therefore <hi>we Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Paye,</hi> and <hi>William Allcott,</hi> &amp;c. are Ministers of Christ. 6. If Reading
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43101:28"/>
Christ's Commission to his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. be sufficient authority for persons to turn Preachers, and then to tell People they hear Christ, because they read his said Commission, and presume to take it upon them <hi>without</hi> immediate Inspiration from him, why may not the Priests of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. be his Ministers as well as you? and why do you dissent from them? Thus we see how you have proved your Call and Authority for what you pretend, even as well as any sensual Impostors, blind Guides and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers may.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6.7, 8. <hi>E. P.</hi> saith, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the holy Apostle understand the Word here to be Christ,</hi> p. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How does he answer the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions then which the Righteousness of Faith gives answer to? Say not in thy Heart who shall ascend into Heaven, that is, to bring <hi>Christ</hi> from above? Or who descend into the Deep, that is, to bring Christ again from the dead? But what saith it? The <hi>Word</hi> is near thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is this all one as to say, the Scripture is near thee, even in thy Mouth and Heart? Or was the Enquiry after the Scripture? Who shall ascend or descend to fetch me the Scriptures? No sure: Was not the antecedent Question of Christ? And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43101:29"/>
surely, none can savingly believe with the Heart, and in true Faith confess with the Mouth, that God hath raised Christ from the dead, so as to be saved, but by that Living Word of Faith in the Heart, which works a true and living Faith therein; and therefore that <hi>Word of Faith,</hi> which begets and works this Faith, is <hi>Christ in Spirit,</hi> who is the Author of this Faith, otherwise the Questions who shall fetch Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not answered. For where, with the Heart, Man belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto Righteousness, and with the Mouth maketh Confession unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. he must needs first feel that Living <hi>Word</hi> of Faith in his Heart to work that Faith in him which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that Righteousness in Man which attends Salvation.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that I did complain of <hi>E. P.</hi>'s injurious way of Writing, in accusing us with <hi>giving better or higher Titles to our own Books than to the Holy Scripture,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing that of <hi>H. Smith</hi>'s Book, where <hi>E. P.</hi> gave these words only for the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, [<hi>A True and Everlasting Rule</hi>] being but the first words of the Title, and leaving out the next following in the same Sentence, <hi>viz. [From God discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>] This I did deem very disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Now to extenuate and excuse the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43101:29"/>
Offence, he asks me, Does those Words [<hi>from God discovered</hi>] added to <hi>The True and Everlasting Rule,</hi> diminish the Heighth of the Title? p. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, as the first Part was only (by <hi>E. P.)</hi> attributed to the Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Design of the Title and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the Book, to which the Title had plain reference, as taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether entirely, that True and Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule, from God discovered, being the Holy Spirit, the Eternal Light and Manifestation of Christ within, or what may be known of God being manifest in Man, plainly testified unto (in the said Book) as that <hi>True and Everlasting Rule,</hi> that was from God discovered; so the Perversion and Abuse is plain.</p>
            <p>I think <hi>E. P.</hi> might have spared his Labour of giving the Reader a Breviate of what he Ironically calls, <hi>The Sweet Convincing Language the Quakers use to treat their Antagonists withal,</hi> unless his own Language had been sweeter, and more convincing than it is, and less Partial and Abusive in his Accusations, as to Matter of Fact; wherein he is still general against the Quakers, as if they all treated their Antagonists of all Sorts with such sharp Language, as some have treated a few; and how far they merited severe Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43101:30"/>
from our Friend, concerned he does not know.</p>
            <p>The Instances of the Quakers Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>E. P.</hi> gives, are upon <hi>T. Lawson, E. Burroughs, W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> but chiefly on <hi>E. B.</hi> who, in Scorn, he terms <hi>Famous,</hi> p. 25. for using the Words <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Child of Darkness, Diviner, Antichrist, Beast, Blind, Pharisee, Hypocrite, Sottish,</hi> &amp;c. These with other Words of like import he has pick'd up among Matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; which though the Language be sharp, 'tis not unscriptural; both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God and Ministers of Christ, (yea Christ himself) did sometime use the like against Wicked Men, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally were such in Spirit and Practice, especially against Envious Persecutors, Deceivers, Hypocrites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his accusing <hi>E. B.</hi> hereupon, <hi>with sentencing a Man to Wo and Condemnation for ever (for asking some sober Questions</hi>) p. 26.</p>
            <p>Herein he apparently wrongs <hi>E. B.</hi> for 'twas not only for the Questions that he censured him (though they were not sincere nor consistent clear Questions), but as knowing that Adversary to be <hi>in Strife and Envy,</hi> as he declares, f. 31, 32. denounces severe Judgment; 1. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely upon the Envious Persecuting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43101:30"/>
Spirit of the Beast in him. 2. Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, upon the Envious Person, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>him</hi> room for Repentance: Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <q>To Own and Obey the Light in his Conscience, that he might know that Obedience (of Christ) which reconciles to God; and that by the same Light he might see his Evil Deeds, and be led up to Christ, from whence the Light comes (thus <hi>E. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> f. 30, 31, 33.)</q> Whence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears, He did not absolutely condemn the Man for ever, but the Beast in him, the evil envious Spirit and Works of it in him; and this can be no just Occasion for <hi>E.

Allcott,</hi> to accuse the People called Quakers with having Affinity with the <hi>Muggletonians in their execrable Imprecations, Curses,</hi> &amp;c. as they falsly declare in their <hi>Antichrist in Spirit,</hi> p. 9. For the <hi>Muggletonians</hi> have absolutely Cursed and Damned Persons for opposing them only; allowing them no condition of Repentance, or of owning or obeying the Light of Christ in them to lead them up to him, as <hi>E. B.</hi> did; neither does any Just Ground ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from his Words (as justly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished before) to deduce any such Rude Censorious and Reviling Question, as <hi>E.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43101:31"/>
in their <hi>Antichrist in Spirit,</hi> p. 34, 35. Their Reviling (yet mistaken) Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on follows.</p>
            <p>☞ viz. <hi>Could the Devil himself have been more Vile, and prodigiously Arrogant, to take upon him to Determine a Man's endless Condition?</hi> When it was <hi>not</hi> the Endless Condition of the Man, but of the Evil Spirit in him, the Beast in him, that <hi>E. B.</hi> absolutely excludes from God for ever; but conditionally declares Judgment upon the envius Man, warning him, <q>
                  <hi>To own and obey the Light of Christ in his Conscience</hi>;</q> that so he might find Repentance, otherwise Destruction would be his Portion. This Distinction I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and clearly find in <hi>E. B</hi>'s said An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Bennit</hi>: The Matter justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered is, much like as if a Son of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (stirred up in Zeal, for Truth) should severely Judge and Condemn the Evil Lying Envious <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Beast and false Prophet in <hi>E. P.</hi> and his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and unto that Lying Spirit in them, declare, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Thou Envious Lying Persecuting Beast, thou Foul Wicked Spirit, thou Malicious Devil and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lyes and Lyars. thou Author of all Mischief and Discord, thou Troubler of the Creation, thou Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacher of God's Heritage, thou that

hast opened thy Mouth in Blasphemy against God, his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven; thou art utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast down and condemned for ever, and to the Pit thou must return, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And you, in whom this Lying Envious Spirit has so violently appeared against the People of God, to Defame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them and their Christian Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: You and your Lyes and Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are condemned with the Light of Truth, and you'll come to Shame and Contempt for the same, and utterly perish, if you do not repent (this is more than a Supposition, 'tis a real Warning to you) the Lake, which is the Second Death, is, and will be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Lyars; and therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, in love to your poor Souls, Return, Own and Obey the Light of Christ in your Consciences, that will shew you your Evil Deeds, your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisies, your Falshood and Envy, and lead you to repent of the same, that you may find Mercy and Pardon in Christ, if your Day be not over; the Spirit of Truth, the Saints Comforter is the World's Reprover, and Judge also of the Prince thereof. Christ's Ministers, who were led by this Spirit, did not wrestle against Flesh and Blood, but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43101:32"/>
against <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the <hi>Darkness</hi> of the World, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Spiritual Wickedness</hi> in High Places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.

            <p>The great Degeneracy hath been such in the World, that a Generation of Men have turned Beasts; the Persecuting En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Spirit of the Beast has made them Beasts, Bulls, Dogs, Foxes, Swine, Wolves, Devourers, Destroyers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the Old Serpent has made them Serpents, Vipers, Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These being Characters in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture put upon Wicked Men: And it is no hard Matter to shew <hi>E.

            <p>Here <hi>E. B.</hi>'s next foregoing words are left out, <hi>viz. [those that love God, keep his Commandments, and they are not grievous</hi>]. Whence it follows, that they

that do not keep his Commandments, do not love him: The Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God accepts them that do not love him?

            <p>
               <q>And then what a sad Sentence of no less than condemnation doth this pass upon all People and Nations, who have not the Scriptures, as being all void of knowledge, that there is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, Christ, Salvation, Good or Evil (without the Scriptures); where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is a Living Evidence, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Creation or Works of God therein of the Eternal Power or Maker thereof.

            <p>And now, <hi>E. P.</hi> to prove thy Brethren, <hi>W. Allcot,</hi> and <hi>H. Loader</hi>'s, false Charge, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>contemn and vilifie the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43101:40"/>
Holy Scriptures,</hi> in their Epistles, and thy own horrid Slanders also; <hi>that they are great Enemies to, and Contemners of Holy Scriptures,</hi> p. 20. of thy <hi>Antichrist in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou summest up thy Argument with divers <hi>If's,</hi> (but assumest no Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pursuant to thy general Charge) as in thy 33 and 34 Pages of thy <hi>Railings and Slanders detected,</hi> thus, <hi>viz. Now if the Scriptures be a dead carnal Letter, Ink, and Paper, saith</hi> Parnel: <hi>If they are, the Precepts and Traditions of Men, saith</hi> Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>in his</hi> Love to the Lost. <hi>If they are no better than an old Almanack, as</hi> Holbrow <hi>said,</hi> Hick<hi>'s Dial.</hi> p. 29. <hi>If to say an Ass hath as much Authority essentially in himself to teach and rebuke, as the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be not to Contemn and Vilifie them, I am yet to seek what is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Assumption or Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position intended (<hi>i. e.</hi> but the <hi>Quakers</hi> say all these of the Holy Scriptures) is here wanting, and the Argument is lame and fallacious, as well as falsly stated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the first Proposition, being not in the terms of the Charge.</p>
            <p>For 1<hi>st,</hi> The Charge is general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Quakers, That they are great Enemies to and Contemners of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> yet the word [<hi>Holy</hi>] not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43101:41"/>
mentioned in the particular Instances fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciously alledged for proof, though it be in the general Charge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If some of the Instances were true, yet to charge them upon the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, is an absurd and unjust way of arguing, <hi>a particulare ad universale,</hi> and no better than to argue thus, <q>If <hi>Edw. Paye,</hi> (the <hi>Baptist</hi>) has raked up and charged divers of <hi>Hicks</hi>'s Lies and <hi>Forgeries</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and added many more of his own to them, then the <hi>Baptists</hi> are all Forgers: But <hi>Edw. Paye</hi> hath <hi>so</hi> done, (is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent)</q> 
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> They may justly deny the <hi>Major,</hi> though the Assumption (or Charge) alone stands good, being plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully proved against <hi>E. Paye</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither are the particular Instances true in fact; the Holy Scriptures are not a dead Letter in the <hi>Quakers</hi> esteem, tho' none of us ascribe <hi>Holiness</hi> to Ink and Paper or the dead Characters, but to the living Divine Precepts and Doctrine therein contained; nor did we ever think the <hi>Holy Scriptures to be but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Traditions of Men</hi>; or (much less) <hi>no better than an Old Almanack,</hi> as the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly accused by these Adversaries, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43101:41"/>
in Spirit,</hi> p. 18. And 'tis far from <hi>J. N.</hi> or any of us either, to say or think, that an <hi>Ass</hi> hath as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>essentially</hi> in himself to teach and rebuke, as the Holy Scriptures. For shame, <hi>E. P.</hi> retract and leave off such foul, gross and horrid Lies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches against the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove, that we name (or call) <hi>the Holy Scriptures, the Precepts and Traditions of Men,</hi> (charged against the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general) <hi>Antichrist in Spirit,</hi> p. 18. <hi>Thou, E. P.</hi> hast repeated this again in thy <hi>Railings,</hi> p. 33. and quotest <hi>James Nayler</hi>'s <hi>Love to the Lost</hi> for it, but not in what Page; and therefore I have been at the pains to view over that Book, to see if I could find any such words, but find nothing like them, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; namely, 1<hi>st,</hi> 
               <q>That the words of the Scripture were given forth from the <hi>Light,</hi> which he calls the Eternal Light, <hi>Love to the Lost,</hi> p. 4, &amp; 20, 21. And that the Ministers of Christ, who have the Word, who are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Word, through such came the Scriptures, which came not by the Will of Man, but by the Spirit, and <hi>so</hi> are of no private Interpretation, <hi>Love to the Lost,</hi> p. 73. which <hi>Spirit</hi> is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43101:42"/>
the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> the Spirit of Light and Truth, <hi>p.</hi> 13, 18.</q> Thus <hi>J. N.</hi> All which is far enough from calling or esteeming the <hi>Holy Scriptures but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Traditions of Men,</hi> as most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly is charged upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by <hi>E. P.</hi> and consequently by his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>William Allcott,</hi> and <hi>Henry Loader,</hi> who had need to retract this and the rest of their Charges, which are notoriously false in fact.</p>
            <p>And <hi>E. P.</hi> thou hast no cause to boast or insult over us, touching the Writings and Sayings of our ancient Authors, which thou hast so foully wrong'd and perverted; and when thou hast made Lies upon them, then falsly to say, <hi>they directly contradict the</hi> Quakers <hi>new Faith,</hi> when by deceitful Perversions, false Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, base and falacious Forgeries, thou hast attempted such Contradiction, as thy self and abettors may for ever be ashamed of, and hast great cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and explode the same, rather than we our ancient Friends Writings. And to evince thy contempt and scorn, <hi>thou shalt take no notice at all of the confused Profession of Faith that</hi> G. W. <hi>makes,</hi> p. 34. No, thou art too big, too great, too high in thy own proud Conceit, to take notice of what such a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43101:42"/>
person as <hi>G.W.</hi> or any of us te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies of our Belief, how sincere soever. But I must tell thee, if thou goest on in this, thy wicked Course of Defaming and Scandalizing us, I hope we shall take further notice of thee and thy base ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Work, to thy own and abettors perpetual shame, to keep your Infamy in remembrance; and when we have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared our Consciences, I doubt not but the Righteous Judge of all (whose People thou hast evilly entreated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd) will meet with thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thy Envious Spirit.</p>
            <p>To extenuate thy notorious Lie and Forgery against <hi>Geo. Fox, of taking the Name of the Eternal Judge of quick and dead to himself,</hi> quoting <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7. of <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand.</hi> Now thou art fain to beg the Question, <hi>viz. Why may not</hi> G. F. <hi>take the Name to himself, as well as approve of those blasphemous Titles given him by</hi> Jos. Coal, <hi>in his Letters from</hi> Barbadoes? <hi>p.</hi> 35. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Antichrist in Spirit,</hi> p. 43, 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Charge here (of approving and giving blasphemous Titles) is very high against two persons deceased, who (we believe) ended their days in peace; and my present Answer is, 1<hi>st,</hi> I have cause to question, whether the said Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be truly and intirely copied or cited
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43101:43"/>
from the Original, by thee <hi>E. P.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> I do <hi>not</hi> believe 'tis an intire Copy. 3<hi>dly,</hi> Whence hadst thou thy Copy and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thereof? And what Persons (that are no Parties nor Adversaries to us) will attest thine to be true and an intire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, according to <hi>Jo. Cole</hi>'s original Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? 4<hi>thly,</hi> If thou canst not produce the Original, then what validity is thy Charge of, if the Credit of all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies thou canst produce, be called in question, for want of impartial Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or the Original to compare them with? For I do really question the truth of thine; and when thou givest an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Copy thereof, probably I may give a further Answer; for I doubt not but I can clear that honest Man, <hi>Jos. Cole,</hi> from giving any <hi>blasphemous Titles,</hi> and that from his own printed Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and <hi>G. F.</hi> also from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; by his known publick Christian Profession unto <hi>Christ Jesus, both as God and Man,</hi> according to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And where and when did <hi>G. F.</hi> say in a Meeting, <hi>I have power to bind and to loose whom I please?</hi> p. 36. What Meeting, and who are Witnesses of this Story? I do not believe it.</p>
            <p>To prove <hi>E. P.</hi>'s false Charge, <hi>That they (i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>say, that Christ
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43101:43"/>
hath no Body but his Church,</hi> Antichrist in Spirit, <hi>p.</hi> 29. (This being shewn not to be the <hi>Quakers</hi> Saying, but something like it, objected against One Person, by some persecuting Priests, as in <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand,</hi> p. 2.) Now <hi>E. P.</hi> again is fain to beg the Question and shuffle, <hi>viz. And why may not</hi> G. F. <hi>deny Christ to have a personal Body, besides or distinct from his Church, as well as</hi> G. Whitehead? <hi>Dip. pl.</hi> p. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I am the Person here falsly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed again, they are none of my words, or negation, nor so much as mention'd in the place quoted in <hi>Dipper plung'd,</hi> p. 13. but the terms [<hi>God-man, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son without thee</hi>] question'd as not Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Language, answered before; which was not on the Question, Whether Christ hath a Body distinct from his Church? Also answer'd presently.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>E. P.</hi> objects against what I said in answer to <hi>Tho. Jenner</hi>'s saying, <hi>Christ sitteth at the right-hand of God in Heaven with a Natural Body.</hi> And accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us with saying, <hi>Christ hath but one Body. E. P.</hi> should have been so ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to have recited my whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in that case, in our <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 33. quoted by him, <hi>p.</hi> 37. and that will clear me from his impertinent Objection
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43101:44"/>
against the words, <hi>viz. They should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Scripture, that say Christ hath two Bodies.</hi> (Here <hi>E. P.</hi> leaves out) [<hi>a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and a Spiritual</hi>] which is very unfair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. And in the Question, <hi>Where doth the Scripture say, that Christ's glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body in Heaven is of Human Nature?</hi> After [<hi>Is</hi>] he leaves out [<hi>a Natural Body</hi>] and [<hi>as his terms are</hi>] whereby I grant, that Christ hath a <hi>Spiritual Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body</hi> of his own. Also <hi>E. P.</hi> takes no notice of my Explication in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If <hi>T. Jenner</hi> supposeth, that we intend the Natural Bodies of Men to be the Body of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinguishing between them, he is mistaken, for the Natural Body and Spiritual Body are two. — And if Christ's Body in Heaven be <hi>Natural,</hi> whose Body is it that is <hi>Spiritual, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> &amp;c?</q> is it Christ's, yea, or nay? And I further add in my Answer, <hi>Apol.</hi> p. 34. <q>If so be Christ's Body in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be <hi>Natural,</hi> then where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle said he shall change the Body of our lowness, that it may be fashion'd like unto his glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. This were all one, in <hi>Jenner</hi>'s sense, as to say he shall change and fashion our Body (which is Natural) like unto his <hi>Natural</hi> Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43101:44"/>By all which I grant Christ's own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body in Heaven distinct from those natural Bodies of Men on Earth; though I must own a <hi>Spiritual Vnion</hi> or Oneness between <hi>that</hi> and his Church, so as his Body in its Fulness is but One Body. And in my <hi>Appendix to reason against Railing,</hi> p. 23. <q>I plainly confess I believe <hi>he</hi> hath a Spiritual glorious Body, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from all these earthly sublunary Bodies.— and that the Heaven, that must receive him, is <hi>above</hi> and larger than the Hearts of Men, <hi>Append.</hi> p. 24.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>E. P.</hi>'s repeating, that <hi>J. Parnell calls Water-Baptism, a formal Imitation and Invention of Men</hi>; and now addeth, that <hi>He</hi> (J. P.) <hi>saith so,</hi> p. 37. whereas it was plainly shewn him, that he did speak this of <hi>Sprinkling Infants,</hi> which <hi>E. P.</hi> calls <hi>Baptism</hi>; and yet saith, <hi>the Name Anabaptists belongs not to them,</hi> p. 13. And why so? If Sprinkling Infants be <hi>Baptism,</hi> are you not <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> when you Re-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize them, or Baptize them again? and yet I did not call you <hi>Anabaptists</hi> on that score, nor in <hi>derision,</hi> as is wrongfully suggested, <hi>p.</hi> 12. but only for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-sake, my words at first being [<hi>the People commonly called Anabaptists,</hi>] p. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis far from me to design any derision, or to put any ridicule upon the People

so called from <hi>E. Paye</hi>'s particular abuses; for I hope as some of them are more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest than himself, so many of them will be ashamed of his malicious Pamphlets, tho' he pretends <hi>the Approbation of several since,</hi> p. 38. which we have little cause to credit, without their own testimony; for some eminent among that People, have declared their dislike of his work already. And it will be far more for their credit and reputation, to stop him from his scribling to defame others, than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to persist therein.</p>
            <p>And as to his <hi>Challenging any to charge and prove against him any thing unbecoming a Man and a Christian, respecting either Life or Principles, Human Frailties except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, p.</hi> 38. I ask him, if to bear false witness against his Neighbours, to belie, slander and defame them, to take up reproaches against them, to pervert and corrupt their words, to gather up, credit and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their Adversaries malicious Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against them, (all which <hi>E. P.</hi> is proved notoriously guilty of) be either becoming a Man or a Christian? or be to do as he would be done unto? (What an easie matter is it for a wicked person to write malicious Pamphlets at that rate?) Or must these Enormities be reputed only as Human Frailties? Will his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43101:45"/>
and Conscience allow him to slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to lie, to defame others, and yet for all that to be a moral Man and good Christian, and Minister to others? I am sure the just God will not so esteem him nor any one else in such a state.</p>
            <p>Upon a serious View and Observation of the Method which he <hi>E. Paye,</hi> &amp;c. has taken up against the People commonly call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> I find it thus, 1. To quote and cite divers of their Adversaries In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives against them. 2. To mis-cite and abuse some of their own Authors Books and Writings against them, sometimes leaving out the most emphatical Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the middle, and sometimes in the end of a Sentence, and many times the most explanatory part of their Answers, thereby greatly altering, perverting and corrupting matters, contrary both to the Authors own Words and Expressions. 3. To invent and forge notorious fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, contrary to our express Christian Profession and Perswasion. 4. From such indirect and unjust Premises, to draw his own perverse and evil Consequences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to render them and their whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Profession as odious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious as he can. 5. Divers of his Authors, to whom he has given credit,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43101:46"/>
and whose odious defamations he has raked up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, were persecuting Priests, and others of party with them, who were as much enemies to the <hi>Baptists</hi> as to us, and long since answered and refuted. 6. He is so credulous, as he seems to take all for granted that such Adversaries have maliciously writ against us; but in many cases takes no notice of our Answers to them; and where he doth, he is very subject to pervert, mince, curtailize and abuse them as before.</p>
            <p>Now I am perswaded the Ministers and People of the baptized Societies, would not be thus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after such injurious Methods. And to me, and divers others, 'tis a wonder that those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Elders of that Society who appear more discreet and judicious (than this injurious Adversary, <hi>E. P.</hi>) do not give a severe check to him, and put a stop to his perverse and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Scribling, (tending to Strife, and to aggravate Divisions, and cause Animosities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Neighbours, and to make Breaches wider among People) and rather seek Peace, Mutual Love and Charity among all; for I must tell them, these crooked Methods which <hi>E. P.</hi> takes will be no small disrepute and disparagement to them that are of the same Society with him, or that own him as a Brother or Minister among them.</p>
            <p>And since in conclusion of his last, he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a Threat, (as if he would frighten us) <hi>That if he be foolishly provoked, we may it is like have a quarterly Packet, to keep our Fame in remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly if he will be so foolish, as to be fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly provoked, or to make a foolish Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ground of his Packets or Pamphlets against us, we shall have little cause to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted or deterred by his Threat from making our Just Defence; and now, since he has so loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarum'd us, he has given us occasion to watch
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43101:46"/>
him narrowly and warily, really believing he'l make no great earnings of such his undertaking, nor advantage of his atchievements, but bring Infamy upon himself, and an unnecessary Charge upon others, and be no small Disparagement to his own Society.</p>
            <p>I have traversed the Controversies long since, and I bless God, that he has made me a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for his Truth and for Christianity in Life and Power (even from my Youth upward) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Deceit, Envy and Hypocrisie, that I have seen in these our Adversaries and Opposers; what personal Detractions or Reflections I meet withal, I value not, my Innocence and Christian Conversation, being well known to many and my inward Peace with the Lord in my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; but wherein I find the Truth abused, and God's Heritage reproached, I am constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God's holy Fear and Zeal to stand up for Truth, and in its Vindication, against its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries and Gainsayers and their Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and hope ever shall, so long as the Lord gives Life and Ability.</p>
            <p>And I humbly thank the Lord my God, who hath hitherto helped and supported me, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, in his Work and Service, and in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Love and Good-will towards all Men.</p>

            <head>The Conclusion.</head>
            <p>I Have hitherto been mostly on the Defensive Part, to remove these Adversaries Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Misrepresentations of our Principles, much I have to except against divers of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Doctrines, particularly about the great stress they lay on their <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> and what they call <hi>The Lord's Supper</hi>; 'tis easy to make it appear that they exactly run parallel with the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> in the manner of their defending ther <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptism,</hi> and the great Weight they place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, contrary to Scripture, and the Doctrine of the Ancient Protestants.</p>
            <p>Please to take a View of some of these Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists Doctrines, and some brief Observations and Questions upon them, as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That by Baptism (i. e.</hi> Water-Baptism) <hi>we must put on Christ, and so become Members of his Mystical Body, Heirs of the Promise of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit,</hi> &amp;c. Antichrist in Spirit, p. 69.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> This is Popish Doctrine, and contrary-to the Apostle's; See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>highest Attainments or greatest Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Holy Spirit, do but fit Men for Gospel Ordinances,</hi> p. 64. Whereof their Water-Baptism is rendred a <hi>Sacred or Holy one,</hi> p. 57, 63.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Where doth the Scriptures say, That the highest Attainments of the Holy Spirit do but fit Men for Water-Baptism? as if that were higher than those Attainments, or the Spirit Inferior to the Element of Water.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But in contradiction to themselves herein, they tell us, That <hi>Water-Baptism is the</hi> initiating
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43101:47"/>
               <hi>and ingrafting Ordinance, whereby the Penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever puts on Christ,</hi> p. 68.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> For which they quote and misapply <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. which shews, That it is by Faith in Christ Jesus that they were Children of God, being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>into</hi> Christ, v. 26, 27. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.19, 20, 23.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That there is but one Baptism in a full and proper Sense, and that is that of Water, in which the Penitent Believer is Buried,</hi> for which they unduly quote <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. and on <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. say, <hi>To be Baptized with Water is the one Baptism.</hi> Pa. 66, 67.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> This appears directly Popish Doctrine, and accordingly held by the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> contrary to the Protestants, and wholy excludes Christ's Baptism by the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Applyed to Water-Baptism, as the Baptism that doth now save us, the End whereof is the Answer of a good Conscience towards God.</hi> p. 67.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> If Water-Baptism be the one-saving Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, then out of the Baptist's-Church there is no Salvation: This is not only Popish but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that very Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. that Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptism being <hi>not</hi> the putting away the Filth of the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That our saying, Water-Baptism was a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Spiritual, <hi>is an apparent Falshood,</hi> p. 68.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> No, 'tis an apparent Truth, <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism was a Figure of Christ's Saving Spiritual Baptism and Washing of Regeneration; See <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That Christ is not come, because that Kingdom is not come that Christ speaks of</hi> 
               <note n="*" rend="inter">Contrary to Christ's own Testimony, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.28. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.27.</note>; I will not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth drink of the fruit of the Vine, 'till I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.29. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.18. p. 73. compared with p. 74. <hi>In that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

they neither marry nor are given in marriage; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they dye any more,</hi> Luk. 20.35, 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> How then shall they drink new Wine with Christ in that World to come, and in that State wherein they shall be equal with the Angels of God in Heaven, suppose ye? And as neither can they dye any more, so neither shall they Hunger nor Thirst any more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49.10. What occasion for New Wine then?</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That his Disciples upon Earth are to Break and Eat Bread, and Drink of the Fruit of the Vine till he come, to wit, in a Personal, Glorious and Visible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> Phil. 3.2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.— <hi>Who shall change our vile Bodies, and make them like his own glorious Body, at Christ's second personal coming visible in his Body of Flesh and Bones,</hi> p. 73, 74.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> And shall those glorious Bodies then have occasion to drink New Wine with Christ, in his Father's Kingdom, do you think? or are you not rather too Carnal in your Expectations, in this Matter, whilst you mean literally? and then do you not delay and put off the Spiritual Eating and Drinking with Christ (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30.) in his Spiritual Kingdom?</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>No Christians can allow them (i.e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>that Christ is come the second Time,</hi> p. 74.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> Yes, true Christians can allow it, tho' these Baptists cannot, wherein they contradict the true Believers Expectation and Experience of Salvation by Christ's coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13.14.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>That the Quakers say they are perfect,</hi> viz. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin</hi> [this is not true by the way, but that to be so is both required of us in this Life, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in Christ Jesus] <hi>but Christians expect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Perfection, that is, a living without Sin,</hi> (as 'tis explain'd by <hi>E. P. Rail. and Slan.</hi> p. 38.) <hi>when they come to glory on the other side of the Grave,</hi> &amp;c. p. 51.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> When do these Men expect to be made clean,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43101:48"/>
in the Grave or at their expected Resurrection unto Glory? If not until they are in their Graves, they dye in their Sins, and then whither Christ is gone they cannot come, <hi>John</hi> 8.21. If not until such their expected Resurrection, what shall become of their Sins, inherent Pollutions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement between their Death and Resurrection?</p>
            <p>A few more of their Unsound and Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrines about <hi>Inspiration, Christ within,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom, and Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That if the Quakers by their immediate Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not resolve what those many other things were that Jesus did, that are not written,</hi> Joh. 21.25. <hi>and what were the Contents of that Writing on the Ground,</hi> Joh. 8.6, 8. <hi>then their boasting of immediate Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be condemned to perpetual Silence and shame to cover their Faces.</hi> Antichrist in Spirit, p. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Contradiction. <hi>Things that are Secret and not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not at all belonging to us but to the Lord</hi>; as in <hi>E. P. Rail. and Slan.</hi> p. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> There they have imposed such a Proof of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inspiration upon us, as doth not at all belong to them, if things not written do not all belong to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.26. they say, <hi>'Tis more than probable that Christ pointed at this Generation of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, the Quakers, who say, Behold he, Christ, is within thee,</hi> &amp;c. p. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> Antichristian Doctrine, contrary to Christ and his Apostle's Doctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That those that are in the Possession of that Kingdom (viz.</hi> the Kingdom of Christ) <hi>neither Marry nor are given in Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the Quakers do Marry,</hi> ergo, <hi>not in possession of that Kingdom,</hi> p. 51, 52.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> Marriage in the Lord hinders not his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Enjoyment of Christ's Kingdom, therefore the first Proposition and Conclusion of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43101:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Argument is contrary to plain Scripture, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Disciples did not expect this Christ to come</hi> into <hi>them:</hi> Namely, <q>This Christ, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whom ye shall hear in all things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. <hi>He,</hi> of whom God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from Heaven, testified, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17 5. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What Christ then? Is there two Christs! (See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.) Is not this Antichristian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, contrary to Christ's own express Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20.17.23. And to these Baptists own Confession, on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>c.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. p. 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Turn to the Light within, saith the Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> these Baptists have in contempt repeated seven times over in less than three Pages (and all under the Title of <hi>Quakerism a great Delusion</hi>) to prove that the <hi>Quakers disown the Doctrine taught by Christ and his Apostles,</hi> and that <hi>they oppose the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ's Prophetical office</hi>; p. 54, 55, 56.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> Here they have opposed and contemned the Doctrine of God's Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, who were all for (and preached) the <hi>Light</hi> within; see <hi>Ps.</hi> 56.13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Jo.</hi> 12.36. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.7. and 2.10 <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and how can the Light of Christ within either oppose his Doctrine Ministry or Offices?
