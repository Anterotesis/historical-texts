            <title>A distinction between the new covenant and the old and how that in the old covenant the Jews priests lips were to preserve the Jews peoples knowledge: but in the new and everlasting covenant Christ the high-priest, is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and he filleth the earth with the knowledge of the Lord God; and the earth being full of the knowledge of the Lord God, then there is no want of it in the eath. And Christ the high-priest, he doth not only fill the earth with knowledge of the Lord God, but covereth the earth with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters do the sea; so the earth shall not be seen. So then it may be seen, that the substance in the new covenant is far beyond the figure in the old covenant. Read, hear, see, perceive and understand, receive and possess.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISTINCTION between the New Covenant and the Old; </head>
            <argument>
               <p>And how that in the <hi>Old Covenant The</hi> Jews <hi>Prieſts Lips were to Preſerve the</hi> Jews <hi>Peoples Knowledge</hi>: But in the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting Covenant</hi> CHRIST the High-Prieſt, is the Treaſure of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and he filleth the Earth with the Knowledge of the Lord God; and the Earth being Full of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord God, then there is no want of it in the Earth. And Chriſt the High-Prieſt, he doth not only fill the Earth with the Knowledge of the Lord God, but <hi>Covereth the Earth with the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do the Sea</hi>; ſo the Earth ſhall not be ſeen. So then it may be ſeen, that the <hi>Subſtance</hi> in the New Covenant is far beyond the <hi>Figure</hi> in the Old Covenant.</p>
            </argument>
            <epigraph>
               <q>Read, Hear, See, Perceive <hi>and</hi> Underſtand, Receive <hi>and</hi> Poſſeſs.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is written in the Prophecies of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (the 11th Chapter) where ſpeaking of the peaceable Kingdom of Chriſt, that was to come, he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain; for the Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> So this was a Prophecy of that Day to come; it was not in the Dayes of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mark, <hi>In THAT Day</hi> (when the <hi>Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea</hi>) In that Day there ſhall be a <hi>Root of Jeſſe,</hi> which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the people, to it (to wit, this Enſign) ſhall the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſeek, and their <hi>Reſt ſhall be Glorious.</hi> Now many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have found this Glorious Reſt, and this Enſign; and to this Enſign do the people gather, and cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it; and all the Warryers in the World cannot pluck down this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, nor take it from the people with their Carnal Weapons.</p>
            <p>Now this is the day of Chriſt in his New Covenant of <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in which the <hi>Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the VVaters do cover the Sea</hi> [Mark] <hi>The Earth ſhall be full of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord.</hi> So then the Earth is not Empty, when it is <hi>full of the Knowledge of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>the Knowledge of the Lord ſhall</hi> COVER <hi>the Earth</hi>; it ſhall not only be Full of it, but it ſhall cover the Earth, ſo as the Earth ſhall not be ſeen. <hi>As the VVaters do cover the Sea,</hi> that when you are in the Sea, you cannot ſee any Land or Earth; ſo ſhall the Knowledge of the Lord be in the New-Covenant.</p>
            <p>For the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will write my Laws in their Hearts, and put them in their Minds, that they ſhall not need to ſay unto one another, know the Lord, for all ſhall know Me from the greateſt unto the leaſt. And they ſhall not need every man to teach his Neighbour, ſaying, know the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Mark, If there be no need to ſay one unto another, or unto their Neighbour, <hi>know the Lord (for the Earth ſhall be full of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord; and the Knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea,</hi> in the New Covenant of Light, Life and Grace; ſo that the Earth cannot be ſeen) then there is no need of the Prieſts, or Teachers <hi>Lips to preſerve the Peoples Knowledge</hi>; for that was only uſed in the Old Covenant under <hi>Moſes</hi>; and whilſt he was read the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was under the Vail. And therefore Chriſt aboliſhed the firſt Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with his <hi>Vail,</hi> who had his Tythes for his Work and Service, whoſe <hi>Lips were to preſerve the Peoples Knowledge</hi>; that was the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that particular Nation. But Chriſt in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is the Treaſure of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi>; ſo that in this Day of Chriſt, the Root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> ſhall ſtand up as an Enſign for the people; and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhall ſeek to it, to wit, the Nations, which many have found.</p>
            <p>And God hath given Chriſt for a <hi>New Covenant</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Old,</hi> and for a Covenant of Light, to enlighten the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, who is God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth: That ſo in this Day of Chriſt (and Salvation) who is a High-Prieſt, Holy and Harmleſs, and Separate from Sinners, made higher then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, who is the Treaſure of Wiſdom and Knowledge; he takes away the Vail of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and takes away the Vail and Covering, that hath been ſpread over all Nations. So it is Chriſt that fills the Earth with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that the <hi>Knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea</hi>; ſo that in this Knowledge, to know God and Chriſt Jeſus whom he hath ſent, is Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>So this High-Prieſt, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> his Work is beyond the <hi>Jews</hi> High-Prieſts, whoſe <hi>Lips were to preſerve the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation's Knowledge</hi>; for Chriſt the Treaſure of Wiſdom and Knowledge fills the whole Earth with Knowledge; and <hi>covers the Earth with the Knowledge of God, as the VVaters cover the Sea,</hi> in his Day of the New-Covenant. And are not theſe the Days of the New Covenant, and the Goſpel, which is not according to the Old? And then what will all you Prieſts (that are made at Schools and Colledges) and Biſhops do in this Day, with all your fat Biſhopricks and Parſonages, when that people need not be taught by you the Knowledge of the Lord? Nor need the people ſend their Children to Schools and Colledges, to learn there the Arts, and how to teach people the Knowledge of the Lord, when <hi>the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> and covered with it, as the Waters do cover the Sea, in the Days of this New Covenant: ſo then there will be no need of your Teachings. And if you come to receive this Day in your Time, then would not you forſake your Fat Benefices and Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and return unto people their Tythes, and confeſs, that Chriſt, who is the Treaſure of Wiſdom and Knowledge, in the <hi>new covenant</hi> ſaith, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give</hi>; and this Commandment of the Lord of Lords is not to be broken; and ſay, there is no need in the <hi>new covenant</hi> to teach people to <hi>know the Lord</hi>; no, not <hi>from the leaſt to the greateſt</hi> of them. For God hath written his Law in their Hearts and put it in their Minds, in the Days of this <hi>new covenant</hi>; and they are God's people, and he is their God, and they all know him from the greateſt to the leaſt of them: So that this <hi>new covenant</hi> is not according to the <hi>Jews</hi> old covenant, amongſt that particular Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had a Tribe of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> whoſe <hi>Lips were to preſerve the peoples Knowledge,</hi> for which they had their Tythes. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come in his <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and hath taken away the Firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it, and diſſannulled the Commandment that gave him his Tythes; and eſtabliſhes the Second and Everlaſting <hi>Covenant,</hi> where all ſhall be taught of God, and ſaith to them that declared this <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and preached his Goſpel, <hi>freely you have received, freely give</hi>; and they were to go and declare this without Bag or Staff.</p>
            <p>So in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> they had no need of Purſe, Silver, Bag or Staff; for they that preached the Goſpel lived of the Goſpel. So the Goſpel of Life and Salvation is Good News and Glad Tidings, being preached <hi>to</hi> and <hi>in every Creature</hi> under Heaven; and the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all men to teach them: And Chriſt doth enlighten every Man that cometh into the World, with the Life in him, the Word, by which all things were made to believe in, and to give them Knowledge. So this High-Prieſt is he, that filleth and <hi>covereth the Earth with the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sea,</hi> ſo that the Earth ſhall not be ſeen; and ſo he both <hi>gives and preſerves the peoples knowledge.</hi> And in theſe Days of Chriſt, in his New Covenant, God poureth out his Spirit upon all Fleſh, to Inſtruct, Teach and Lead them, by which Spirit <hi>Sons and Daughters way Propheſie, and the Old Men may dream Dreams, and the Young Men and Hand-maids and Servants may ſee Viſions</hi> by the Spirit which God hath poured upon them, &amp; hath given them a Spiritual Knowledge, &amp; which Spirit reveals the Things of God unto them, and leads them into all Truth. For in the old covenant the Lord poured out his Spirit upon the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and gave them of his good Spirit to Inſtruct them, though they rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt it; but in his New Covenant, which is not according to the Old, he pours out of his Spirit not only upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> but upon all Fleſh of other Nations, as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> that all Fleſh may ſee the Glory of God, and ſee their Salvation. For the Lord ſaith, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.26. <hi>All fleſh ſhall know, that I the Lord am thy Saviour and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Mighty One of</hi> Jacob. And again, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Every Valley ſhall be exalted, and every Mountain and Hill ſhall be made low, and the crooked ſhall be made ſtreight, and the Rough plain; and the Glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, all fleſh ſhall ſee it together, for the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</hi> And is not this the Goſpel Day of Chriſt in his New Covenant? and muſt it not be fulfilled? but your Mountains and Hills muſt be laid down, and your crooked Wayes and Natures muſt be made ſtreight, ſmooth and plain, before this Glory of the Lord be revealed, and that all Fleſh come to ſee it.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Luke</hi> 3.6. its ſaid, all Fleſh, where he ſpeaks of the fulfilling of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. how <hi>All fleſh ſhall ſee the Salvation of God.</hi> Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 18, 26. the Lord ſaith, <hi>All fleſh ſhall come to VVorſhip before me: And the Lord ſaith, It ſhall come to paſs, that I will gather all Nations and Tongues, and they ſhall come and ſee my Glory, and I will ſet him for a Sign among them,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt. And the Lord ſaith, <hi>his Peoples Wilderneſs ſhall be like</hi> Eden, <hi>and their Deſart as the Garden of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 51.3. And are not theſe the Days of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and to be fulfilled?</p>
