         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N different Readers, whose
iudgments are sophistically
mixt with humors, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
as many are now a
dayes, who are more ready
to condemne with their
turbulent tongues, then to
amend with sensible iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
As for them, or any
such carpers, I am reasonably perswaded to set as
lightly by their censures, as they are farre from
conceiuing well of any thing, but what agrees
with their owne humors, or fictions. To those
that are of more plausible spirits, who (for the
most part either say little, or conceit the best, and
either applaud what is good, or passe ouer with
silence what is not hurtfull: And to those that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some vnderstanding themselues in this Arte,
as either Nauigators, or Shipwrights, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be partakers of the Experiments &amp; Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of other mens knowledge. To the one I
commit the censure, to the other the profitte of
this Trauellors labours: knowing that such as are
<pb facs="tcp:20676:4"/>
wise, will rather winke at samll faults, then rashly
reproue what may pleasure others. Though such
as are curious, and thinke themselues sufficiently
expert in this Arte, finde nothing herein contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that may satisfie their expectation: yet the
Gentlemans hope is, they will iudge fauourably of
his intentions and proceedings, and passe it ouer
with patience, for affections sake to the Arte it
selfe: and hereafter doubts not but to doe them
more profit and pleasure in matters of some other
deepe performances. If any thinke, that what
this booke speakes, is very strange; he may see the
very title saies as much: And it is good for an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to be as good as his title. If any thinke it
is but a Tale, and no truth, I cite you my Tales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister,
(which is more then most men will doe.)
And he to auoide euery such imputation, hath his
confirmation hereof, vnder the hands and seales
of the chiefest of the Custome house in London,
besides many thousand witnesses in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Then sit downe and read it, if it
doe not profit thee, yet his trust is,
it shall not displease thee.</p>

gathering a certaine hidden
vertue from sundry sortes of

making thereof (by labour

is not therefore to
be condemned of any, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
highlie to be commended of all. The Phisition
of many simples, making one compound medicine,
doth not onely reape profit to himselfe by the same, but
purchaseth commendations, and applaudities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And the studious Reader, out of sundry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
doth select some cheife principles, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth

or to adde pleasure to others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20676:5"/>
Of these thrée comparisons: The first is excellent
for imitation in generall. The second very necessarie
for diuers in particular. And the last, though not so
highlie estéemed of the common sort of people, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their ignorance in Artes, and Sciences: yet for
the good that may come thereby to a common wealth,
nothing inferiour to the best: Especially where the
studie tendeth to good and vertuons exercises, or the
practise and contemplation thereof to laudable Artes,
and experiences: Of which Artes, namely, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall;
the practise of Nauigation is a principall
member: as hauing participation in Arithmeticke,
Geometry, Geography, Cosmography, and Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
or rather (to say the trueth) the quintessence, yea
the very proofe and tryall of them all: For albeit men
read or here neuer so much of Cosmography, or Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,
yet without practise and experience it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.
And how can perfection bee attained, but by
making vse &amp; transporting from place to place, therby
beholding the diuersities of daies and nightes, with
the temperature of the Ayre in sundrye regions, by
which the whole course and reuolution of the spheare,
is made apparant to mans capcity? Séeing therefore
that the same Art and skill is not performed, either by
rashnes of chaunce, or strangenes of miracle, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to certain vniuersall precepts, or documents
deriued from the mathematicall fountaines, beeing
the very essentiall matter and substance thereof; I
thought good (being intreated thervnto) not to omitte
a most strange, and well deseruing labor, of no lesse
worth than wonder, effected and brought to passe by
a Gentleman of our owne countrey: The which (but
that we are very much adicted to admire strange, and
contemne our owne, according to the old prouerbe:
<q>
                  <l>Forsooth it must needes be true:</l>

would beget as good an opinion amongst vs: for first
inuenting the same, as that same miraculous instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>Pandulphus Collenutius,</hi> in his Neapolitane history.</p>
            <p>Not therefore to beguile Expectation, without any

of the Pynace on either side one, vpon a square iron
axeltrée: The third turned in a frame of thrée foote
high, and was fastened by deuises at the hinder part
of the Pynace, directly vnder the Sterne, with which
he would make such swift spéed on land, as many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

But as, <hi>Ea habentur optima, quae &amp; iucunda, honesta,

               <p>For her passage by water, shee was very carefully
calked, and pitched to kéepe the water forth: Shée
had also a seat placed in her, iust in her middle part,
and doubtles right opposite one against the other: she
had oares likewise of an equall length and weight to
rowe her with, and foure mastes and yardes of the
most fine light timber that might be had, or procured:
shée was orderly rigged with ropes and sailes, and in
all poyntes had all manner of tacklings prouided for
her as fit and necessarie, as belongeth to a ship of her
burthen: Shée had twelue péeces of Ordinance in
her, that went off by a strange deuise in iust order one
after the other; They were planted on a platforme
framed for that purpose vppon the Tower-decke in
their equall proportions, and no man neere them at
their discharging: Her forecastle was framed lower
then the sterne by a foote; vpon euery toppe, and yard
arme shée was garnished, and set forth with flagges,
auncients, streamers, and pendents of rich Taffetie,
the coulours sable, and argent, according to the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

he also againe with a loud voice dared his aduersarie

that which befell him by his error, he had done of very

               <p>Upon Monday being the twentieth day of Iulie
last past, betweene the houres of nine and ten of the

brought foorth of the house of the right worshipfull

neere vnto the Church, to proceede and passe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in her iourney, <hi>viz.</hi> From the battlements of
the Church tower of Lamborne, by Ayre, Land, and
Water vnder LONDON bridge to the Custome
house Key of the Citie of London, by the industrie

brought into the Church yard, she shot of her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
being twelue peeces, in order one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to the wonderfull admiration of the multitude
of people that were there assembled to behold her,
for the most part of them neuer sawe shippe, or py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
before, except it were some few of the better
sort. There the multitude of people was so great,
that by reason of the throng, and presse amongst
them, one whole houre was spent before the Pynace
could be brought to the ground platforme; and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon the Cables to ascend vp to the battlements
of the Tower,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20676:9"/>
Shée was no sooner set vppon the Cables, but was
ascended by degrees vp into her place vppon the
battlementes, not hauing any man in her: where
shée continued till two of the clocke in the afternoone:
At which time shee was let of from the Tower, the
distance of twentie foote to hang in the ayre, in the
full viewe, and sight of all the people there present:
As shée so hunge in the Ayre, her Ordinance went
of, and no man neare her by Twentye foote with
many fire woorkes, and other strange and worthy
deuises, to satisfye the peoples expectation for that
day, for the voyage was determined to beginne the
next day following. But the vngouern'd vulgar
sort of people not content with these shewes (albeit
they came <hi>Gratis)</hi> began to gather together in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuoue
and vnruly head, as if they meant ſoure
hurt or preiudice to the woorke, or workman, for they
pretended themselues not satisfied with all this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they might sée one come downe from the toppe of

Vpon Tuesday the one and twenteth day of Iuly,
betweene the houres of twelue and one of the clocke
that day, this Pinace was prepared to set forward
on her voyage, little thinking that the concourse of
people had bin so great, as was there the day before to
hinder her passage: but when shee was brought
foorth into the Churchyard, she found there the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
much increased, and the company as troublesome
and vnruly, as the day passed: yet that did not let, or
with-hold the determinate purpose of her procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
but with the great labor and paines of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
men at the least that were helping, shee was
brought to be set vppon the Roapes, and there rested
fortie foote from the ground, out of the peoples reach,
vntil such time as al things were sufficiently viewed
by him that was to trauaile in her: for it behooued
him to extend his care in a case of such danger, where
he had so great a wager, as the venture of his life, in
the performance of his vndertaken voyage; and the
rather, for that the loue, the demeanor and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the people that were there, were altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
vnto him, whose rule and vndiscreete beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiors
afterwards appeared to bee such, as by their
negligence they had purchased to themselues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
an vntimely ruine and ouerthrowe, had not
Gods loue, and mercy beene beyond all hope, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and expectation. For this Aduenturer hauing
many friends (for hee was very well beloued) to the
number of threescore persons, men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
being assembled together, and got vppon the top
of the Towre, contrary to his knowledge, where the
platforme was, &amp; where diuers other ropes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the pullies, and counterpoises were fastened to
the maine pynnacles thereof: the common multitude
little regarding, and lesse knowing to what vses they
were made, some leaned, some hung, &amp; some sat vpon
<pb facs="tcp:20676:10"/>
the ropes, othersome gate vp to the top of the pynna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to which the ropes were fastned, and there ſtood
holding the yron (whereon the Uane was sixt) in
their handes, that they might the better, haue full
sight of the comming vp of the Pynnace: But as
<hi>Mala minus expectaeta grauiora,</hi> so the mischiefe that
then suddenly befell was the more grieuous, by how
much it was the lesse expected, or dreamed vpon. For
at the first motion of the Pynace hauing her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>
in her, determined to ascend towards the top
of the tower, 2. of the maine pynnacles, with men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, fell down into the tower, amongst the people
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was there standing as thick as might be, that euery

nor vpon the ropes, nor any of them that were
standing vpon the leades vnder the fall of the pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

               <p>There might you haue heard a grieuous stir and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation
of the people for the suspected losse of friends,
some crying for the losse of their husbandes, some for
the lacke of wiues and children: other some for their
friends, and kinsfolke, all greatly doubting, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting
that a great part of the people in the Tower,
had by that fall bin vtterly killed, or at least grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hunt or maymed: but when an happy voyce gaue
notice from the top of the Tower, that no person had
sustained either losse of life or limbe, or receiued any
hurt or bruise, the people all wondered at so strange
a miracle, and gaue God the glory: yet some of the
most incredulous sorte remayned doubtfull and
would not bee confident of such happinesse or good
fortune, vntill they might ſee their husbands, wiues,
and children come downe and descend from the toppe
<pb facs="tcp:20676:11"/>
of the Tower: which was not long a doing, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man striued to make most hast, and he thought
himselfe most fortunate that could attaine to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</p>
               <p>All this time, hée that had vndertaken this iourney
sat ready in the Pynace to procéede in her, and beheld
all that disasterous chaunce which had happened,
But when he sawe that all was in safetie, and that
neither man, woman, nor child had receaued the
least hurt by that accident, hée was much ioyfull for
them, greatly comforted in himselfe, and gaue God
hearty praise, and thankes, for sending consolation
in such hopelesse extremitie. But as the musition
neither strayneth the string of his instrument too high
for feare of breaking, nor letteth it too lowe for feare
of bistuninge: So God still kéepeth a meane, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffering men to be careleslie secure, nor driuing
them for want of comfort to despaire.</p>
               <p>After this, the Gouernour of the Pynace came
forth of her, and went vp into the Tower to bee an
Eye-witnes of what had happened, and finding all
things sufficient, and stronge for his procéeding, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this misfortune, he came downe chéer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and with a resolute heart to goe forward on
his iourney, But many of his friendes both learned
Preachers, and others went about to disswade
him from this aduenturous enterprise: Alleaging
his attempt too venturous, his purpose dangerous;
and his presumption egregious, and to be a great
sinne in tempting the mercie of God in so strange
and vnhearde-of manner of boldenesse. WHO
sodainelye made answeare that this president being
so wonderfull, and beyonde hope, did more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and anymate his procéedinges, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans perswasions could possiblye preuayle to
the contrarie: For now hée felt the helping hand
<pb facs="tcp:20676:11"/>
of his mercifull God to bée readye to assist him in
all his actions, especially in this his iourney: So
in <hi>the name of God</hi> hée ascended vp to the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of the Tower in the Pynace, where stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp hée turned himselfe to salute all his friends,
and taking them all by the handes, hee sat downe
in the Pynace, and by his owne industrie, and
labour let himselfe downe by degrées to the ground
to the ioye and wonder of all the beholders.</p>
               <p>At the lower end of the ropes were the wheeles,
and diuers other Engyns, prouided for his trauell
by Land, readye attending his comming downe:
On which whéeles after some little time hée pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Pynace; and all their other Engyns in
their seuerall places; and sitting in her, made her
passe too and fro in the church-yarde, as well to
sée that all things should be fit, and well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his trauell, as to content the people that
stoode desirous to sée the rest performed of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
aduenture: From thence hée proceeded to the
place from whence shee came in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partlye in his waye to <hi>London,</hi> yet that small
part of his iourney did more vexe and trouble him,
than a whole dayes trauell in the rest of his voyage,
by reason of the multitude of people, that did so
followe, and pester him, and the deepenesse and
straightnesse of the way that did so excéedingly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, that hée was constrained to rest the hbest
part of the next day from the trauelling any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus although his beginninges aswell in
respect of the former mishappe, and vnexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
the vnrulye concourse of the common people,
and the badnesse of the way, were very combersome
and might haue ministred much cause of discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet his resolutions were so setled, and his hopes
so fully bent vppon gods helpe in those his businesses,
<pb facs="tcp:20676:12"/>
that his procedings proued excéeding prosperous, and
the end was concluded with the fulnes of all content
and expectation both of himselfe, and all his welwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
as appeares by his further progresse in the
same.</p>
               <p>Upon Wednesday the two and twentieth of Iuly,
betwéene the houres of foure and fiue of the clocke in

of glorye enritcheth the Souldiour with a certaine

Marchant, although he lye tossed with billowes, and
tempest-shaken in the middest of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> yet is he
made merrie at mid-night with the hope of Lucre.
He that is mooued with delight in this matter of <hi>hope</hi>
exactly declares his certaine confidence of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

and probable securitie of obtayning the thinges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>So fared it with this Traueller, who moued with

And then descended into the next vallye, The
passage to which hée found to be so easie, that he was
thereby encouraged to attempte the climing to the
top of the next hlll, béeing farre higher, and stéeper
than the first, but that proued so difficult, and full of
toyle to him in the trauell, that it was full night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could attanie to the top thereof; and his bones
were so ouerwearied, and grieued with the extremity
of that labor, That hauing then trauelled a Mile, and
an halfe he was there constrained to rest and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed
no further, but to put a déepe crosse into the earth,
where hee left his boate, and some people with her

Upon Saterday the fiue and twentieth of Iulye
betwéene the houres of seauen and eight a clocke in

<hi>Childerie Downes</hi> to the lodge of the right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sir <hi>Edmond Fetiplace,</hi> being from thence distant
some two miles and an halfe, and there by reason of
the tempestuous weather, as extremitie of <hi>Lightning,

passing any further, and there being about the houres
of Two and Thrée of the clocke in the afternoone, hée
ceased and left of to labor. The rayne hauing falne
so wonderfully fast, that the Pynace (had shee béene

for (the shower being ended) there was in her by esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

tenne showers another time: and money lent to a
Marchant falling Banckrupt to vpholde his credit,
may bee acounted so much money giuen: So the

him, in that it was so néedefull by reason of the

finding it now very painefull, and irksome vnto

béeing Frydaye, onely to calke, pitche, and

vpon the land: Launching her foorthwith into the
water, to make tryall whether (without further repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
shée was able to indure her trauell vppon the
Water: which vpon search hee found so sufficient,
as that her former shaking by Land, had not much
hurt, or annoyd her.</p>
               <p>Upon Saterday beeing the first of <hi>August,</hi> about
twelue of the Clocke, this Gentle-man intended to
commit both himselfe, and his Pynace to the mercie
of the water, and very earely in the morning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
diuers great waights, and put them into her,
so by the greatnes of the waights caused the Pynace
to sinke vnder the water, to enable her by the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Timber and planckes to defend any
breach that might happen by her going vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in that iourney, and that with more speede and
safetie hee might ariue at the end of his determined
voiage: being in good hope he should receiue lesse da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
vpon the water then he had sustained vpon the
land. This done, he thought himselfe in such securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as if he did in <hi>Portu nauigare.</hi> But it fell out cleane
contrary; for a company of rude persons, béeing
Bargemen, (a kinde of people by nature, and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
immoderate, barbarous, and vnciuil) wading
in the water to the Pynace, with great violence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and pulled her vp and downe, as if they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nothing else but to haue shaken her asunder.
Which when the <hi>Commander</hi> of her heard of, and
<pb facs="tcp:20676:15"/>
perceiued, with what kind and milde speeches and
intreaties as hee could, hee perswaded them to disist
from their rude and vnciuill manner of behauiour.
But all preuailed not, they were so farre from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of to continue these wrongs and iniuries, as
they returned vild and vnciuill spéeches to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman:
and not contented with that, their company
increased to the number of tenne, or twelue persons,
all Bargemen, some with long Pike staues, some
with long hookes, and other weapons, and barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assaulted this distressed Uoyager, hauing but two
men with him, attendants in his company, who were
both grieuously wounded and hurt in their heades
&amp; other places, by these ryotous persons: for all this
these rude fellowes were not satisfied, neither for the
abuse offered to himselfe, nor the hurtes done to his
men, but they manifested their further cankred sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
and malice, (after the hurt men were retyred
into their lodgings, for safegard of their liues) and
went vnto the Pynace where they had left her, and
with great stones, hookt staues, and other weapons,
maliciously rent and spoiled her, and beat great holes
through her, not forbearing to continue this violence
and out-rage, vntill they thought they had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
torne her for trauailing any more, either by land
or water. Thus to be led by the brain-sick resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of idle humors, &amp; to follow the multitude, (which
the <hi>Philospher</hi> termeth to be <hi>Monstru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> multorum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitum,</hi>
A Monster with many heades) is but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in sturbance, to take pleasure in doing iniuries,
and to heape one mischiefe on the necke of another.</p>
               <p>This was a great ouerthrow, and hinderance to
this Trauellers voyage, and might haue béene his
vtter vndoing, if their diuellish purposes had taken
their full effects: for by this misfortune he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to stay at <hi>Streatley, Satterday, Sunday,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:20676:16"/>
part of <hi>Munday,</hi> as well to cure and recouer his men,
as to mend &amp; repaire his boate; which (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked)
were both reasonably well performed by the
<hi>Munday</hi> following: so that by this time his men
were somewhat recouered, and inabled in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone
to passe in a boat which he had hired of purpose,
to carry them some foure miles a day, as they were
able to endure the ayre, with drummes and sortes of
Musicke, by which both himselfe, and his men recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
much consolation and comfort.</p>
               <p>The first, second, or last occasions of feare did not
cause him to distrust of hopefull end: but as a wise
ship-master when hee setteth foorth from the shoarer
and goeth to Sea, laying aside the remembrance of
wife, children, house, and familie, imployeth his body
and minde only to the due performance of his shippe
to a gainefull hauen: So notwithstanding all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that befell him, either by misfortune or disorder,
he patiently vnder went them, and still carried his
minde and intendments ready and prepared to doe
their best to bring his busines to happy and succesfull
conclusion: And so vpon Monday being the third of
<hi>August</hi> betwéene the houres of one and twoo of the
clocke in the afternoone, he began to trauell by water
at the place where hee left the Thursday at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thither, for his Pynace was water-borne being
vpon whéeles, as shée trauelled vpon the land: From
thence hée directed his course from <hi>Streatley</hi> to <hi>Pang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornelocke,</hi>
béeing distant from <hi>Streatley</hi> by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
foure miles: And comming thither about sixe of

               <p>Uppon Tuesday béeing the fourth of <hi>August</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the houres of eight and nine of the clocke in

and passed from the place where hee left the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ouer the banckes of the said <hi>Locke</hi> vppon his
<pb facs="tcp:20676:16"/>
whéeles into the water on the other side of the locke,
vntill hee was water-borne, and then hee cast the
whéeles with other deuises from him, and so beeing
cleare in the water, rowed with his oares, going soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forward vntill hee came to <hi>Maple Dirrham-locke,</hi>
bing distant from <hi>Pangbornelock,</hi> some thrée miles,
where he came a shoare in his boat againe, vpon the
whéeles, and passed through a long Wood wharfe,
there by land a very deepe and troublesome passage,
which was so painefull by reason of the bad way, and
the extremitie of heat, that the people (beeing very
many of the better sort, pittied him much, and were
greatly sorry for his painefull labor. All which hee
did by his owne toyle and industry: and yet not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
vpon his Art, but that hee ascribed the meanes
to Gods will and pleasure, without which hee could
not haue done any thing. Two things therefore are
wished to be increased in men of his Profession: the
first is, the true feare of God, &amp; then a carefull dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in all things belonging to their Arte; where the feare
of God is not, no arte can serue the turne, for that
were to make of arte an Idole; yet those that feare
God, must take héed they tempt him not: they ought
therefore to vse arte as the meanes that God hath
ordayned for their benefite, and be thankfull.</p>
               <p>After he had rested himselfe about two houres, and
well recreated and refresht his body at Sir <hi>Michael
Bluntes,</hi> he prepared to proceed forward passing in the
boate vpon the whéeles below the locke into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and when she was water-borne againe, hee cast
the whéeles from him, and passed forwarde with his
Dares towards <hi>Reading-locke.</hi> Unto which place be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
he came, he might discry a far off a whole army of
people, vpon <hi>Causum-bridge,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vpon the banks of the
riuer, which followed the Pynace with her drumms
and musicke, vntill shee came to the Locke. There
<pb facs="tcp:20676:17"/>
might you haue séene the number of the people double
encreased, and the Trauailer with diuers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and others in his company (all strangers) very
kindly receiued and entertained by Knights, Ladyes,
Esquiers, and sundry persons of the best rancke
and fashion, to the number of two thousand people
and vp-ward, of men women, and children, beeing
halfe a Mile from the towne, whether with great
paines the Pynace was brought, and placed in the
Kings forge at the Pryorie: and such as were in the
Trauailers company passed into the town, comming
thither about sixe of the clocke, and rested there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
trauialed that day eight miles.</p>
               <p>Upon Wednesday beeing the fifth of <hi>August,</hi>
betwene the houres of ten and eleuen of the clocke in
the fore-noone, he conuayed his Pynace as priuily as
might be to the water, to auoyde and beguild the
presse of people, beeing then dinner time: at which
time he thought that people would haue least minde
to looke after his procéeding. Notwithstanding vpon
the least newes of his departure muttured, the people
instantly increased, and flocked together in greater
troopes and abundance, then were there the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with their drums &amp; seuerall instruments musick,
of aswell to shew their owne gladnesse and content of
mind, as to adde comfort to the Trauailer, for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
doth iubilate the heart with pleasure, excites and
stirs vp humors and inuites so magnanimity: and no
other cause can bee yeiled then this, that betwixt
mens hearts and musicke, there is a certaine sympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
correspondencie, and proportion. Who can giue
any other reason why the Loadstone draweth yron,
but a sympathy of Nature? why the needle touched
but with such a stone, should neuer leaue looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the North-pole? who can remember other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then Simpathie of nature? So wee may say, that
<pb facs="tcp:20676:17"/>
such is the nature of mens mindes, as musicke hath a
certaine proportionate Simpathye with them: As
our tastes haue with varietie of daintie cates: our
smelling with varietie of odours, &amp;c. But not to insist
vpon this, they followed (I say) this traueller all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vpon the shore, a mile and better vpon <hi>Sunning-Locke,</hi>
where (but that God miraculously protected,
and defend him) both the Pynace and hee in her had
béene cast away and drowned: for vnaduisebly by
the counsell of a Miller he presumed to shut a narrow
straight, which had a great fall ioyning to the <hi>Locke:</hi>
where a stumpe had almost ouer whelmed the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
but shée escaped that danger, onely receauing
some quantity of water néere about thrée or foure gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.
About foure, or fiue of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone
he came to <hi>Sunning,</hi> where by diuers people of
the better sort and condition with him and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
were verie kindlye entertained. There hee res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that night, casting in his minde, how he might
escape the like troublesome lockes and dangers.</p>
               <p>Upon Wednesday being the sixt of August, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
the houres of ten and eleauen of the clocke
in the forenoone, he prepared his Pynace to trauell
vpon her whéeles by land to <hi>Maydenhead,</hi> vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it to be thithér thirtie miles by water, and but
eight miles by land, besides many dangerous lockes
which might put him in great hazard: so he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to trauell by land to <hi>Twyford,</hi> but had not passed
halfe a mile, when the maine Exe of the pron-worke
brake: by reason whereof, he could passe no further
then <hi>Twyford,</hi> for it was foure houres before it could
be mended againe: So there he rested that night, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thither about six of the clocke.</p>
               <p>These crosses and impediments would haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
many, &amp; mooued them to discontentment as well
for the often exercising of one thing which eng<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:20676:18"/>
satiety, and for that by nature men affect to bee vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
As for that also they found such discouragements
in the estate and condition of the exercise and busines
which they had in hand: yet these could not set warre
and battell in his thoughts, or hinder the progresse of
his intendments. But that on Friday being the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
of August, betwéene the houres of nine and ten
of the clocke in the forenoone, he began to procéed and
goe forward on hís painefull iourney, which he found
to be full of taile and labour, by reason of the déepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the sand, which caused the Pynace to trauell
very sadde and heauilie. That day she trauailed to
little <hi>Weeke,</hi> in <hi>Maydenhead</hi> thicket, being distant
from <hi>Twyford</hi> foure miles, and there rested about six
of the clocke.</p>
               <p>Upon Saturday the eight of August, betwéene the
houres of nine and ten of the clocke that day, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
from little <hi>Weeke</hi> in the Thicket aforesaid, to
<hi>Maydenhead:</hi> Through which Towne, he endured
the most painefull toyle and trauell, that he had in all
his iourney, by reason of the déepenesse of the myre
in the stréete, wherein the whéeles pierced a foot déepe
at the least: and so forward to <hi>Maydenhead</hi> Bridge,
ouer the Thames. Into which Riuer he passed with
his whéeles, vntill he was water-borne, where hée
purposed to procéede on his iourney on Monday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
So for that day he returned to <hi>Maydenhead</hi>
about foure of the clocke, hauing trauailed the same
day some three miles, and there rested he that night,
and the next day being the Saboth day.</p>
               <p>Upon Monday, being the tenth of August, betwéen
the houres of nine and ten in the morning, he began
to trauell from <hi>Maydenhead</hi> Bridge by water, to
which place hee came from <hi>Maydenhead</hi> vppon his
wheeles, being intreated by diuers Knights and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that were there assembled, that they might sée
<pb facs="tcp:20676:18"/>
the manner of his trauell by land, which after they
had fully viewed at their pleasure, hee tooke off hee
wheeles, and lanched her at the place where the was
water-borne the Saturday before vpon her wheeles:
and so passed by water to <hi>Winfor,</hi> and there stayed to
refresh himselfe two houres, and from thence rowed
to <hi>Staynes</hi> with his oares attending him, hauing a set
of loude Instruments of musike in them, from <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhead</hi>
to <hi>London,</hi> to doe him comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in his iourney. And hauing trauailed eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
miles this day, hee rested at night at <hi>Staynes,</hi>
comming thither about six of the clocke.</p>
               <p>Upon Thursday being the eleauenth of August,
betweene the houres of six and seauen of the clocke
that morning, he began to proceed forward towards
<hi>Kingstone,</hi> and arriued there betwéene 10 and 11 of
the clocke the same forenoone, Notwithstanding hée
staied at <hi>Hampto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Court</hi> halfe an hower by the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Sir <hi>Charles Manners,</hi> where he refresht himself:
So by estimation hee rowed his Pynace aboue fiue
miles an hower, for foure houres together: by which
the watermen were brought into a wonderous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
and admiration, one while conceiuing the
best of it; another while the worst: Sometimes thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it might be done by art and cunning; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
againe, iudging it a thing impossible: So as
the earth being vnmanured, bringeth forth brambles,
and briers, with many stincking wéedes; and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
also, springeth forth here and there darnell, and
cockle; Euen so their vnderstandings were so ill gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that sometimes they did not onely yeild vaine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations,
but in the middest of their best conceits,
many times vniust surmises, and impertinent distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Hee staied at <hi>Kingston</hi> thrée houres, and from
thence passed to <hi>Braineford,</hi> he landed at maister <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions</hi>
keye there dwelling, and rested there Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb facs="tcp:20676:19"/>
and Thursday, comming thither about 5 of the
clocke in the after-noone, and hauing rowed that day
thirtie miles.</p>
               <p>Upon Thursday being the 13. of August betwéene
the houres of seauen and eight of the clocke in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening,
he priuately bended his course towards Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
onely with one paire of oares in his company to
carry sufficient witnesses of his landing at the <hi>Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome-house</hi>
Key, leauing his musitions, and the rest
of his company behind him, doubting the multitude
of boates, and people might much annoy him, if hee
should attempt to land there by day. So betwéene the
houres of 12 and 1 of the clocke that night he landed
at the <hi>Custome-house</hi> Key, in the presence of 4 of the
kings seruants of the <hi>Custome-house,</hi> and diuers other
witnesses that saw the whole performing of the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and came with him thither.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned againe to <hi>Braineford</hi> with
his Pynace, and there landed by 4 of the clocke in the
morning intending to prepare his Pynac<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and his
company in some better fashion, vnderstanding the
peoples expectation of his comming to London, and of
his landing at the Custome house Keye, which had
béene performed againe, but for the misbehauiour,
and vnrulynes of the boates, that with such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and throng prest so néere the Pynace, that shée
could not any way haue frée passage.</p>
               <p>The most part of Frydaye, Saterday, and Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
he spent in painting and rigging her with masts,
yardes, Sailes, Flagges, Ancients Streamers, and
pendents: And all other prouision for her ordinance,
and fyer workes, in as laudable a sort, and fashion,
as for a ship of greater burthen: which the knightes,
<pb facs="tcp:20676:19"/>
Ladies, and gentlemen néere <hi>Braineford,</hi> and all sorts
of the common people, rounde about that place,
hearing, and vnderstanding of, resorted thither vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Mondaye, expecting the Pynace shoulde
that day haue departed, but shee intended not to
proceede till the morrowe following. Then the
better sorte intreated the commaunder of her to do
them that especiall fauour that they might see the
manner of his trauell both by Land and Water:
which request made by so worthy personages, hee
willingly subscribed to, and with all expedition pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Pynace on her wheeles, and brought her
from whence shée stoode priuate, into a large Court,
where there stoode priuate so many Coaches, and
the great gates were so lowe, as shée could not that
waye haue passage into the stréete, But another
waye béeing found by which shee was brought
foorth, there wanted no Spectators to attend her
comming, but the streete was full of people, and
most of the better sorte, for there were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
knights. Ladyes, and Gentlemen, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
seene the Pynace passe by Lande, desired
also that they might see her swymme on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
This was likewise graunted by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller.
And they all satisfied to their full contents
and pleasure.</p>
               <p>Uppon Tuesday beeing the Nyneteenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
betweene the howres of Foure and Fiue of
the clocke in the morning, the Pynace was brought
and launched into the water, and passed forwardes
towardes <hi>LONDON,</hi> with Drummes, and
lowde Instruments of Musicke, shooting off her
ordinance at her departure from Brayneforde:
<pb facs="tcp:20676:20"/>
Shée came before Westminster betwéene 7 and 8 a
clocke in the morning, which beeing discried a farre
of, there came such a multitude of all sortes of boates,
that neither shée, nor any of her company could rowe,
or stirre any way, by reason of their rude thrusting
vpon her: So shée was constrayned to presse by all
meanes shée could to <hi>Sumerset Court</hi> at the wall, not
beeing able to come néere the staires, at which place
she was drawne vp by roapes with force of men, and
by them carried into a house in the Strande, where
we now leaue her vntill her further procéedings.</p>
               <p>Upon Wednesday being the ninetéenth of August,
betwéene the houres of ten and eleauen of the clocke
in the forenoone, the commaunder of the foresaid Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
shap't his course to the <hi>Custome-house of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of London,</hi> with diuers witnesses for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his iourney with him. Who in the presence
of the <hi>Customer, Controller,</hi> and <hi>Surueyor</hi> there, did of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer
to make oath of the performance of the voyage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
a certificate of what he had effected: which
was willingly granted, &amp; deliuered vnder these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
hands, and seales. And he himself very kindly
entertayned by all the officers, and feasted
at the Customers house and all
his company.</p>
