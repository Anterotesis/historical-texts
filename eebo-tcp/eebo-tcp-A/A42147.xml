            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Being frequently importuned by <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Boyl</hi> to make Experiments upon <hi>Indian</hi> Simples, and to give an Account of my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Succeſs to ſome <hi>London</hi> Phyſitians, and knowing you to be very Curious in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, I take this Opportunity to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94443:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to you what wonderful Virtue I have found in the Root called <hi>Hypepocoanha,</hi> which hath done ſuch Wonders in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the Cure of Dyſenteries and Lyenteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fluxes, Diſeaſes proving very fatal both to Fleets and Armies, as well as unto Cities and Countries.</p>
            <p>This Famous Root hath an admirable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to blunt thoſe Acidities which irritate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſtimulate the Expulſive Faculty, it ſtays all violent Excretions of the Guts; and this it doth not by aſtringency but by its Cleanſing Quality, expelling thoſe Venemous Particles which were lodged in the Inteſtines, and afterwards by its Balſamick Properties heals and comforts the Bowels, and repairs thoſe Breaches which the Enemy hath made.</p>
            <p>I knew an Old Gentleman who fell into a Malignant Diſtemper for many Days, and was brought ſo low, he could not turn in his Bed, and had conſiderable Quantities of Blood mingled with his Stools, a black Thruſh in his Mouth, with an intermittent Pulſe, after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94443:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all other Methods proved inſufficient, I gave him the Tincture, Spirit and Extract of this Root in all his Liquid Alliment, and he found wonderful Relief, and recover'd Health and Strength.</p>
            <p>A young Man who was miſerably afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with frequent returns of Pains in the Bowels, and upon every change of his Meat or Drink was put into a Scowring, ſo that all his Nouriſhment was loſt, and he could not ſleep, being diſturbed by frequent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Stool, and it had waſhed away all his Fleſh, and reduced him to a meer Skelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. I gave him the Medicines made with the Root, and nothing elſe, and his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per abated, and his Strength returned, and he is now alive and in good Health.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why I reduce moſt <hi>Indian</hi> Drugs into the form of Tinctures, Spirits and Extracts, is to preſerve their Virtues, which elſe are apt to periſh and Decay by Time and change of Climate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94443:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>This Root is not without the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good Authorities of Travellers and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians. A famous Doctor in <hi>Scotland</hi> wrote me a Letter of ſome great Cures he had wrought with it amongſt Children, who were brought unto the brink of the Grave by Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gripings in the Guts; it hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off all that Green Choller wherewith they are extreamly moleſted, and thereby prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Diſtempers cauſed thereby.</p>
            <p>I knew a Gentlewoman who was brought into a very weak Condition by a Diſentery or Looſneſs, ſhe had taken many Glyſters made with very proper Ingredients, her Phyſitians thought ſhe had an Ulcer in her Bowels, which might be the Occaſion of her frequent Relapſes; I gave her Drops drawn out of this ſovereign Root, ſometimes in Wine and Water, and ſometimes in Milk and Water, and ſhe quickly recovered, and hath had no returns of her Diſtemper many Months.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94443:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>I could give twenty more Inſtances of Cures wrought by this Remedy, but theſe I think are ſufficient for any Phyſitian to make tryal of it when the vulgar Methods fail; but ſome Men will not think it for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to approve of what they don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe themſelves; but I take you to be a Man of more Honeſty and Candor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign more to do good than to get Money.</p>
            <p>I very well remember that Sir <hi>Charles Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> told me that a Phyſitian in <hi>France</hi> had done great Cures with it, and kept it as a Secret a long time, and when it came to be known to be ſo effectual againſt all ſorts of Fluxes, the Secretary of State to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom gave order that all the Phyſitians and Chyrurgeons belonging to the Hoſpitals and Army ſhould be furniſht with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Margrave</hi> have given particular Deſcriptions of it, and I am told that the <hi>Germans Ephemerids</hi> gives an Account of it as an infallible Medicine. <hi>See the</hi> 20th. <hi>Volume.</hi>
