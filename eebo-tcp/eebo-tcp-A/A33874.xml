         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <q>Favour is Deceitful, and Beauty is Vain; but
a Woman that feareth the Lord, ſhe ſhall
be Praiſed,</q>
                     <bibl>Prov. chap. 31. v. 30.</bibl>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WE cannot but wonder and be ſenſible of the
works which Nature ſets before our Eyes; but
on the other ſide we muſt acknowledge that
thoſe Objects ſo lovely and worthy of our
Admiration, are ſubject to Corruption, and that they fade
away and Periſh. <hi>All things that are under the Sun ſhall Periſh;
and there is no longer any memory of things that are paſt; and thoſe
things that are to come, ſhall be forgotten by thoſe that come after us,</hi>
ſayes <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes.</hi> Thoſe Empires formerly ſo
Vaſt and Potent, what are now become of 'em? The mighty
Men and Potentates of the Earth, after they have made a
noiſe in the World for Fifty or Threeſcore Years at moſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they retire? What is become of all their Grandeur
and Luſter? They are returned into the Earth from whence
they came, and by a fatal neceſſity they inſtruct us, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62815:3"/>
All that is no more then Duſt, muſt return to Duſt. <hi>The Days
of Man,</hi> ſayes David, <hi>are like the Flower of the Field, which in the
Morning is clad with a Thouſand lively Colours, but no ſooner is it
cropt, but it Fades and Withers, nor is there the leaſt Beauty of it
to be diſcovered by the Evening.</hi> This is the fate of the things
of this World. 'Tis then upon the meditation of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that they ought to reflect. 'Tis to the Conſideration
of Eternal Bleſſings that we ought to apply our ſelves, to the
end we may learn ſo to govern our days, that we may be ſaid
to have a Heart of Wiſdom and Underſtanding. <hi>The fear of
the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom: A good Underſtanding have
all they that do his Commandments; His Praiſe endureth for ever,</hi>
Pſalm 3. <hi>Favour is Deceitful and Beauty is Vain, but the Woman
that feareth the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſhall be Praiſed.</hi> It may be juſtly ſaid,
that never any Perſon merited this Praiſe more then the <hi>Moſt
High, Moſt Excellent, and Moſt Potent Princeſs, MARY
STUART, Queen of</hi> England, Scotland, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>
                  <p>My Deſign is therefore to endeavour to ſet before your
Eyes the ſurpaſſing Virtues of this great Queen, not only to
excite your Admiration of that Piety, that Greatneſs of Soul,
that prudent Conduct which ſhe made appear in all her
Actions, and in all her Words; but more eſpecially to follow
the Examples of Piety and Sanctity, of which we have been
ſome part of Us the Eye-witneſſes during her Life, and which
ſhe left us after her Death.</p>
                  <p>I muſt acknowledge my ſelf altogether unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a task ſo far above my ſtrength; only my Zeal for the
Memory of this great Princeſs, and the great deſire I had,
that we ſhould make the beſt benefit of a Life and Death ſo
Holy and ſo Pretious in the ſight of God, has engag'd me in
deſpite of my ſelf, and caus'd me to forget my weakneſs in
going beyond the limits of my Character.</p>
                  <p>Think it not then ſtrange if I obſerve not in this diſcourſe,
all the Methods and all the Rules of Art. Conſider that there is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62815:3"/>
ſomething, I know not what, of Irregular in Sorrow and
Affliction, and that it is not ſo much the work of my Wit as
of my Heart; <hi>it being out of the abundance of my Heart, that my
Mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> Moſt Holy and Divine Spirit, who didſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven
this Pious Queen, enliv'n me now with a ſacred Fire,
to the end I may render ſerviceable to thy Glory, the Holy
Examples which he hath given us, and that by the imitation
thereof we may become more Prudent and more Pious.</p>
                  <p>Never fear it, 'tis not here my deſign, according to the
Idea's of the Worldly Eloquence, to ſtudy for flattering Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
to give in this place falſe Phraſes to falſe Virtues.</p>
                  <p>When we have for the ſubject matter of ſuch diſcourſes
any one of thoſe common and Worldly Lives. in whom we
can find nothing to commend but the laſt motives of a long
delay'd and almoſt fruitleſs Repentance, it is a difficult thing
I muſt confeſs, if I may not ſay impoſſible, but that we muſt
flatter Vanity, and confound Fortune with Virtue. But here
all our trouble will be, that we ſhall not be able to find Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
enow to ſet forth ſo many Virtues, nor Terms ſtrong
enough to expreſs ſo many admirable Qualities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Nature and Grace ſeem'd to be at ſtrife to accompliſh
this moſt incomparable Queen. What a Majeſty and Grandeur
in her Aire! What a ſweetneſs! What a modeſty in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance!
What a politeneſs in all her Manners! What Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Graces in her Perſon! And theſe you know were the leaſt
things to be commended in her: For if we paſs to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of her Soul, what a large Field was there for Elegies, or
rather what a ſubject of wonder and admiration! In the firſt
Years of her Youth, this Princeſs diſplaid the beſt Natural
diſpoſition in the World, a ſweet Humour, agreeable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
equall; a Heart upright and ſincere; a ſolid and firm
Judgment, and a Piety beyond her Age. And it was upon
this ſincere report, that the great Prince who eſpous'd her,
deſired to be united to her, declaring, That <hi>all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62815:4"/>
of Fortune and Intereſt did never engage him ſo much as thoſe
of her Perſon, and particularly thoſe of her Humour and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
A ſentiment truly great, generous, prudent and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like,
and ſo much the more noble, and worthy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
as being rare in great Perſonages, who regulate their
Friendſhips only according to their Intereſts, and have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo much Chriſtianity nor niceneſs, as to conſider that it
is Virtue which produces and cheriſhes Friendſhip, and that
when a Man is really a Man of worth, he can never be too
attentive in making choice of the Perſon to whom he is to be
ty'd all the Days of his life. However, this was the Care of the
great Prince who eſpous'd her, and as his intentions were
pure and upright, God heard his Prayers and his Wiſhes in
giving him for a Conſort, I will ſay, not only the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and moſt accompliſh'd Princeſs of <hi>Europe,</hi> but the moſt
perfect of all Women that ever were in the World. Of whom
we m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y ſay, that all Virtues were aſſembled together in her
without any mixture of Vices. And in ſaying ſo, I ſay no
more then what was the publick and unanimous Voice of all
People; and of this Princeſs it is, that we may juſtly ſay,
what is ſaid in the <hi>Proverbs, Many Daughters have done Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
but thou excelleſt them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in regard that all the Precepts of the Goſpel are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
in theſe two things; love God with all thy Heart, and
thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, theſe were the two Eſſential things
that comprehend ſo many others, which this Pious Soul
moſt effectually ſtudyed. 'Twas by Reading and meditating
upon the word of God, that her Soul was purified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
it ſelf in the deſires of Eternal Bleſſings. That we
may be always with God, it behoves us to Read and Pray
often. <hi>God ſpeaks to us in Scripture, and we ſpeak to God in Prayer,</hi>
ſays St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The Reading of the Holy Scripture fills
the Soul with light, and ſeparating it from the Vanities of
the World, raiſes it up to the Love of God. This our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62815:4"/>
Princeſs knew moſt admirable well, and this was that
which ſhe practic'd with a Devotion and Zeal, always wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Applauſe. With what reſpect, with what attention
did ſhe Read this Sacred and Divine word! With what Zeal
and Fervency did ſhe apply her ſelf to Prayer! This is the
accompliſhment of Happineſs, ſaid <hi>David, Happy is the Man
who ſets his Affection upon the Law of the Lord, and meditates upon
it Day and Night. Happy he, who Addreſſes himſelf to thee. I
lift up my ſelf to thee, and I make my Prayer to thee in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
In this ſacred Book it was, that this Pious Princeſs had
learnt, that the only employment of the bleſſed in Heaven
will be to adore God. <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God who art,
and will be for ever,</hi> is the continual Song of the bleſſed Spirits
above. You People of the World, who only conform your
ſelves to the examples of the Grandees upon Earth, learn from
the Pattern of the moſt ſolid and moſt Illuſtrious Piety that
can be ſet before your Eyes, to make Prayer a moſt aſſiduous
and regular Duty. Prayer is no way different from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of other Virtues, and we attain to it by the ſame ways.
'Tis by a diligent Care and Practice, in applying the mind to
the objects of Faith, in entertaining good Thoughts, and
by endeavouring to excite in our ſelves Holy deſires and
Holy affections. Not but theſe means may be ſufficient of
themſelves to cauſe them to grow in us; but becauſe that
God is pleas'd to conceal his ſupernatural Operations under
thoſe means that appear Human. <hi>Knock and it ſhall be opened
unto yee; ask and you ſhall receive.</hi> The Queen's, great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
never hindered her one Day from being preſent at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers, which may be ſaid to be the leaſt time that ſhe
employed on that Duty. For how often in her Cloſet did
ſhe not humble her ſelf before the King of Kings, in whoſe
ſight the King's of the Earth are but as Duſt, to acknowledge
how mean and deſpicable ſhe was, <hi>in compariſon of him, before
whom the Angels cover their Faces.</hi> With what Humility did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62815:5"/>
ſhe not pay him Homage for all that ſhe had, and for all that
ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I paſs over in ſilence the trouble and perplexity of
this great Princeſs, when the Prince her Auguſt Husband,
after redoubled ſollicitations from the Engliſh Nation, found
himſelf conſtrain'd to paſs over into <hi>England.</hi> Which way
ſoever the Princeſs turn'd her ſelf at that time, ſhe beheld
nothing on every ſide but occaſions of fear and affliction.
<hi>France</hi> and the King of <hi>England</hi> in League together, were
upon the point of deſtroying the proteſtant Religion. This
Republick ſaw themſelves in imminent danger. The liberty
of <hi>Europe</hi> was threatned with approaching Ruin. <hi>England</hi> in
particular was in ſuch an agitation as tended to a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
The wrong'd and oppreſs'd People were reſolv'd
to hazard all, rather then ſee their Laws and their Religion
overturn'd. In this extremity what was our Princeſs to do,
but pray to God, as ſhe did without ceaſing, in the publick
Churches, in her Chapel, privately in her Cloſet, that he
would be pleas'd in order to the accompliſhment of his Holy
Will, to direct all things for his Glory, to the advancement of
the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, and the preſervation of
the lives of Two Princes, of which the one was her Father,
and t'other was become another ſelf, as being ty'd to her by the
ſtrongeſt tyes on Earth. God heard her Prayers. Never was
a Revolution of that importance with leſs Tumult, with more
Calmneſs, and leſs Bloodſhed. The People who had call'd in
that grsat Prince for the ſupport of their Laws and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
receive him with loud Acclamations and Teſtimonies
of their extraordinary joy. Afterwards K. <hi>James</hi> took upon him
a Reſolution to retire out of his Kingdom, without being
oblig'd to it, and without the leaſt violence offer'd to him.
'Twas to the prudent Conduct of the preſent King, and the
Queens Prayers, that we are to aſcribe the ſucceſs and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this miraculous Revolution through the diſpenſation
of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62815:5"/>
They who had the Honour to be acquainted with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this great Queen, well knew that the luſtre of a
Crown did never dazle her. No, never Princeſs of ſuch an
Illuſtrious Birth and Rank as hers, deſcended, as every body
knows, from a long Race of Kings, and Ally'd to the greateſt
Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> was endued with ſuch a real Humility:
And thô ſhe were more capable of Reigning then any Perſon
of her Sex, and that ſhe had given Teſtimonies of it in tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and difficult Conjunctures, and thô ſhe performed that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome
employment, ſo much to the ſatisfaction of the
Engliſh as will cauſe her to be always belov'd and lamented by
that Nation, nevertheleſs there was a real ſorrow to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in her Countenance, that ſhe was to quit this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to which ſhe had been accuſtomed, and to whom the
pleaſantneſs of it appeared ſo charming, where ſhe had been
reſpected, careſs'd, eſteem'd, and if I may preſume to ſay it,
ador'd by all the World; where while ſhe led a calm and
pleaſing Life, ſhe has been heard to ſay, and I have heard her
my ſelf, when ſhe was congratulated upon her advancement
to the Crown, <hi>That many times, ſo much Grandeur was a burth<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n.
That in ſuch Stations People liv'd with leſs content to themſelves
then others, and that ſhe ſhould wiſh ſhe were in</hi> Holland <hi>again.</hi>
And indeed ſhe had Reaſon to ſay ſo: For it may be ſaid of
thoſe that Govern, that they reſemble the Stars that ſhine
with a bright luſter, but are never at reſt. And this repoſe
it is which being made ſo good a uſe of as ſhe was wont to
do, that is ſo beneficial for thoſe that deſire to take care of
their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>'Twas this deſire of her Salvation which eſtrang'd her ſo
fervently from the things of this World, and which caus'd
her to think ſo often of her end. 'Twas this Idea of una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
death, which this devout Soul ſtill ſet every day
before her Eyes, looking upon it, as attended and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
with the Sentence of God, that will in that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62815:6"/>
either pronounce for or againſt us, an Eternity of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or an Eternity of Miſery and Damnation. Come Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
Souls, unworthy Souls that think you have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for your Salvation, and who, over-rul'd by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of your Affairs and your Pleaſures, delay your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
till the laſt minutes of your gaſping breath, come
and learn by the Example of a great Queen, that the moſt
Eminent, the moſt difficult, the moſt indiſpenſable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ought never to make us forget the grand affairs of
Salvation, and the formidable Judgment of the laſt day. <hi>I
have let no day paſs,</hi> ſaid the Pious Queen, when they told
her what a dangerous condition her Life was in; <hi>I have let
no day paſs without thinking upon Death.</hi> So that ſhe did not
look upon it, as the people of the World are wont to look
upon it, with dread and Horrour, but ſhe lookt upon it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Moſt Chriſtian-like manner, as the end of her time,
and the happy entrance into Eternity. 'Twas this Reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſhortneſs of Life, and the inconceivable Diuturnity
of Eternal Bliſs, which wrought in her this Effect, that ſhe
was not taken with any thing of Temporal Grandeur, but
that ſhe had a high eſteem of Eternity. She had frequently
thought upon that Sentence which will be pronounced to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of us at the hour of Death. <hi>You ſhall be no more.</hi>
A fatal Sentence for ſo many people, a Terrible decree, of
which Death it ſelf is to be the Executioner. But they who,
like her, think and meditate upon death in their Life time,
die not when they die, death being no more to them then
the Beginning of Life.</p>
                  <p>This Pious Queen meditating upon death and the duties
of Chriſtianity, had learnt in the Sacred Scriptures, that the
Love of our Neighbour neceſſarily attends the Love of God,
and that the Glorious promiſes of Life Eternal, are only
made to thoſe who are uſeful to Mankind; either by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
or by Succour or Aſſiſtance. 'Twas this Charity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62815:6"/>
which is ſo highly recommended in Holy Scripture, by the
Saviour of the World, which this Pious Queen exerciſed with
ſo much care and ſo much Zeal. Whatever repreſented it
ſelf to her Eyes as a ſuffering Perſon, was the object of her
Compaſſion and her Charity. With what goodneſs did ſhe
ſtill inform her ſelf of the wants of neceſſities of thoſe that
were in Affliction? With-what care did ſhe order 'em to be
provided for? Her Alms had no other Bounds then thoſe
which God had given to the Grandeur of her Power. <hi>We
have ſeen Tears in her Eyes, for ſorrow that ſhe</hi> could not do ſo
much as ſhe deſir'd. With what Goodneſs, I will not ſay of
a Princeſs and a Queen, but of a Mother; did ſhe take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Accompts, and make particular Enquiries for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of Poor Families, Parents over-burthen'd with a great
number of Children, Children depriv'd of their Parents,
Aged People without any relief of Children or Kindred? But
more eſpecially, with what Goodneſs, with what Tenderneſs,
did ſhe intereſt her ſelf in the Diſtreſſes and Want of a great
number of Perſons of Quality, who had generouſly quitted
their Country, their Dignities, their Eſtates, their Relations,
to follow Jeſus Chriſt, rather then do any thing to wrong
their Conſciences. You know it, you that weep, you that
with ſomuch reaſon lament a loſs ſo great, ſo overwhelming and
ſo highly deſerving your Moans and Lamentations. I cannot
diſapprove the Tears you ſhed, let 'em have their free courſe;
if ever Perſon merited the Effects of your ſorrow, without
doubt 'twas this Auguſt Queen: But ſet 'em however their juſt
bounds, and remember that 'tis the decree of Heaven, and
that we ought to yield an entire and profound ſubmiſſion to
what ever comes from thence.</p>
                  <p>Let us take care to appeaſe the Wrath of God juſtly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
againſt us, which bereav'd us of this Pious Queen, of which
the World was not worthy. If we deſire to do any thing
pleaſing to God, acceptable to the memory of this Good and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62815:7"/>
Charitable Princeſs; let us make good uſe of this Example
of Charity which ſhe has ſhew'd us while ſhe remained among
us in this World; let us renounce all manner of Pride and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and if we have any thing to ſpare from our Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
let us employ it well, let us be Charitable as much as
in us lies, Let us Love our Divine Saviour in the Perſons of
the Poor who repreſent him, ſo that he may ſay to us, at the
Great Day, as he has ſaid to the Queen, <hi>I was a dry and ye gave
me to d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ink, I was a Hungry and ye gave me to Eat, I was a
Stranger and you Reſcu'd me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, for as
much as you have done it to one of theſe little ones ye have done it
to me, Come and enjoy the Kingdom which was prepared for ye from
the Beginning of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas this Charity that made her ſhut her Eares againſt
Calumny and Backbiting. Never durſt any one ſpeak ill of
any body before the Queen. Neither Flattery nor Calumny,
two of the moſt dangerous Peſts of Soveraign Courts, durſt
never open their Mouths in her Preſence. Slander was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
banniſh'd from her ſight and Hearing. <hi>I abominate the
Secret Slanderer, and him that is double Tongu'd, for he is the
Deſtruction of ſeveral that liv'd in Peace,</hi> ſays the Wiſe Man.
And indeed it is not enough for Great Perſons not to be
Slanderers, but they muſt never ſhew any marks of their tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pleaſure in Slander; let it be deliver'd with never ſo much
Wit and quaintneſs. For what do they do by their Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and encourging ſmiles, but animate the Slanderer, and warm
the malicious Serpent, that his malignant Sting may peirce
more ſurely and more to the quick. Let 'em Underſtand
that they are no leſs the Aſſaſſins of their Brethren, when by
their Cruel Abettings, they ſharpen the weapon that runs 'em
through; then if they ſtroke the Fatal blow themſelves that
made the Mortal Wound. <hi>Lord ſays David, Who ſhall abide
in thy Tabernacle? He that is pure in his Life, whoſe actions are
juſt, who ſpeaks always according to Truth, who Slanders not his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62815:7"/>
Neighbour, and who lends not his Ear to the Backbiter.</hi> This is
then one more Encomium which it behoves us to give the
Queen, and which you, who had the Honour to be near her
Perſon, knew that ſhe moſt juſtly deſerved. Let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to imitate her in this as well as the reſt of her Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Virtues.</p>
                  <p>If I make it thus my buſineſs to ſet before your Eyes, the
Virtues of this Queen, 'tis becauſe they were thoſe which
She particularly Careſſed; and becauſe they are alſo in reality
ſolid Virtues, and the Foundations of all the reſt. But if
ſhe poſſeſſed 'em in an eminent Degree, it may be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Flattery, that there are few perſons in the World, that
had for their ſhare a greater number of thoſe which the
World ſo highly boaſts of, and which without doubt are very
agreeable and moſt uſeful to perſons of Quality, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to thoſe that are ſo highly exalted above others.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that Beauty, that Majeſty, that comely Grace,
that noble Aire which accompany'd every thing ſhe did;
She had together with a ſolid Judgment, a Polite and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wit. She was extreamly addicted to reading, aud had
made good uſe of it. She gave a Sound Judgment of mens
Writings, and the Products of Wit, but with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Modeſty, which made her frequently demand the
Opinion of others, rather then give her own Judgment. Her
Converſation was eaſie, and ſhe gave a pleaſing Turn to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing ſhe ſaid, ſhe ſpake French and Dutch with the
ſame readineſs as Engliſh. And when there happen'd to be
perſons about her of thoſe three Nations, that underſtood no
other then their own Language, which happen'd almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, ſhe ſpoke ſometimes one, then another Language,
with a Surprizing readineſs, and without ever miſtaking,
which is very Extraordinary, and ſo well ordered her buſineſs,
in ſpeaking to every one in their turn, that never any Body
departed from her preſence but was extreamly ſatisfied; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62815:8"/>
charm'd with her obliging behaviour. She alſo wrote as ſhe
ſpoke a free and natural Hand: She was very well read in
Hiſtory, ſhe was likewiſe a Lover of French Authors, and
underſtood all the Delicacy of that Language.</p>
                  <p>She was perfectly well inſtructed in Religion; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had frequent Diſcourſes with Learned and able Divines,
ſhe had greatly advantag'd her ſelf by their knowledge. So
that it may be truly ſaid that the Devotion was an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Devotion, Sincere and far remote from Superſtition and
all manner of Oſtentation.</p>
                  <p>However a Conſiderable time was requiſite to accompliſh
all this; and therefore there was ſomething of admirable in
the Diligence of this Excel<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent Queen, and very Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in a Perſon of her Sex, her Age and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
<note n="*" place="margin">She was wont to riſe by ſix a clock in the morning Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> For ſhe ſpent every hour of the day to
profit and advantage, far different from moſt
People, who covetous of many things, are ſo
prodigal of that little time which is left 'em,
and which is ſo burthenſome to 'em, that they
ſeek always to waſt it. Who is able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
two things ſo oppoſite? So much Love for Life, and
ſo little eſteem for the time that Limits it.</p>
                  <p>But I return to my Subject; and I muſt tell ye, that beſides-this
knowledge and theſe Lights that the Queen had acquir'd;
ſhe has a good reliſh in general, which gave her the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to find out in things, that which was good, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that which was bad; ſhe was able juſtly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,
and ſhe had a high eſteem for Perſons of merit and
Piety. And it may be truly ſaid, that thoſe Perſons that
ſhe Honour'd with her particular Confidence and Eſteem, are
Perſons of ſolid and diſtinguiſhed worth; therefore ſhe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cheriſh'd 'em, and whatever buſineſs ſhe had, ſhe wrote
to 'em from time to time with her own Hand: Together with
all this: Her Inclinations were admirable; ſhe was generous
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62815:8"/>
Charitable, Good, Liberal and Beneficent beyond Expreſſion.
So that ſhe was belov'd, not as uſually Great Perſonages are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
out of Intereſt, or Neceſſity, or Policy; for ſhe had
in that the ſame Advantage that Private Perſons have, to be
belov'd by Choice, by Eſteem, by Inclination, and becauſe
ſhe was altogether Amiable.</p>
                  <p>Never was the Eſteem and Affection which all the World
had for this Great Princeſs ſo well underſtood, as when ſhe
departed for <hi>England.</hi> Every Body preſſed to make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to her, and tho' ſhe were going to receive a Crown,
the ſorrow that the People had to ſee that ſhe muſt leave 'em,
made 'em forget their joy that ſo much Grandeur and Honour
was preparing for her. The People crowded in throngs from
diſtant Cities: They brought their little Children to ſee her,
to make 'em Admire her, to make 'em remember her, and to
wiſh her the Bleſſing of Long Life and Proſperity with their
Undefiled and Innocent Mouths. When ſhe parted from the
<hi>H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gue</hi> all the People throng'd in Heapes the Court to the
Coaches could not paſs; every Body Wept, and every Body
loaded her with Benedictions and tender wiſhes. All the
People attended her to the Sea, and the Sky reſounded with
the loud Cries and Farewel Acclamations of the Multitude.
And indeed when theſe ſort of Demonſtrations of Love and
Affection happen, more eſpecially in Republicks, where the
People are not obliged to teſtify what they have in their
Hearts, it muſt be acknowledg'd, that theſe loud Cries, theſe
good Wiſhes and Benedictions are the Voice of the Heart,
or rather the Voices which Merit and Virtue produced in the
Heart, and caus'd to iſſue forth from as many Lips as there
were Perſons.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the good Qualities peculiar to thoſe of her
Sex, it may be ſaid, that ſhe had a Ripe and Solid Judgment,
and a ſurprizing Capacity for the management of Affairs,
and which caus'd the Admiration of Foreign Miniſters. This
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62815:9"/>
Great Queen in a Word was endued with all the Virtue, and
all the Charms of the moſt Virtuous and Amiable Women,
and all the Merit and Capacity of the moſt Famous Men.
This, next to God, was your Workmanſhip, Great and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Hero, who having made choice of this Princeſs, a
Princeſs after your own heart, took pleaſure in making it
your buſineſs to bring to perfection ſuch happy Inclinations,
and inſtructed her in the Great Art of Ruling, ſo difficult
for thoſe that are deſirous to acquit themſelves as you do.</p>
                  <p>'Twas with ſo good a ſecond that this Great King ſhar'd
the Government, leaving to her the Conduct at Home while
he was oblig'd to croſs the Seas, and put himſelf at the Head
of a League, of which he was the ſoul and <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi>
What was then the Employment of our Pious Queen? She
redoubled her Vows and Prayers to Heaven, and in the mid'ſt
of her Alarms and Fears for the Preſervation of a Perſon ſo
dear to her, ſhe kept her ſelf at the foot of the Myſtical Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
where her Prayers and the Anſwers to 'em were as ſo
many Angels continually Aſcending and Deſcending to and
from Heaven. But then you ſaw her at the Helm of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
iſſuing forth her Orders like a Prudent and Politic
Princeſs, and truly worthy the Great King with whom ſhe
was Aſſociated; and whoſe Genius and Maxims ſhe obſerved.
Yet with ſo much Diſcretion and Reſervedneſs, that when
there fell out any thing of Delicate and Unexpected, upon
which ſhe could have time to conſult the Great Prince her
real Oracle, ſhe always did it. With what Tranſports of
joy did ſhe behold the return of this Great Monarch! After
he had been expoſing himſelf to guard all <hi>Europe</hi> from the
Slavery, into which, in all human probability, it was falling,
without the Interpoſition of his Reſiſtance. What Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what Gladneſs on his Part, to Reimbrace the Object of
all his Eſteem and all his Tenderneſs! What Acclamations!
What ſhouts of Joy! How were the People charm'd to behold
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62815:9"/>
the Reunion of two Perſons of ſuch an exalted Merit, of ſo
rare a Virtue, and ſo Unanimouſly ty'd together for the
preſervation of their Religion, their Laws and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!
And then it was, that this great Princeſs ſurrendring
her Scepter and Royal Authority into the Hands of her
Auguſt Husband, betook her ſelf again to reading and reſum'd
uſual Employments, like that Roman ſo Famous in Hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
who after he had led Armies and won Victories, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to manure his ſmall Farm, with the ſame Humility
as if he had never won Battle, or merited Triumph.</p>
                  <p>But if this Great Princeſs were admir'd while ſhe held the
Reins of Government, ſhe was yet more to be admir'd when
ſhe retir'd to her Privacies, where the more nearly ſhe was
known, the more ſhe was belov'd eſteem'd and reſpected.
She carry'd her ſelf toward all whoſe Protectrix ſhe was!
What an Affliction to ſo many poor People to whom ſhe was
a Bountiful Mother! What a Blow! What a cruel Blow to a
Prince, who having ſuch a Sincere and immaculate Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for ſuch a Virtuous Conſort, grounded upon Eſteem and
Merit, feels his Bowels rent and his Heart pierced through
with a Thouſand Darts, in looſing a Dear Companion the
only Object of his Tenderneſs and Inclination. She in
whoſe Boſom he confided his Secrets; with whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
himſelf in his Sorrows, and Rejoyced in his Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and who had for him the moſt profound Veneration,
the moſt Sincere Affection, and a Friendſhip the moſt Ardent
and Tender that could be imagin'd. Thus this Great Heart
that was never known to be Greater nor more Conſtant then
in misfortunes, was caſt down by this Fatal Stroke, that
took her for ever from his ſight. Fatal Minute, Sorrowful
Minute for him and for us; but happy for her, who is now
entered into the Poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory. Let all the
Veneration, all the Zeal, all the Affection which we had for
theſe two Auguſt Perſons whom Heaven it ſelf had brought
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62815:10"/>
together, be now united in Hero who ſtill remains among us.
His Intereſts are ours, his Misfortunes ours, His Advantages
ours, His Proſperities ours, and in a word our State depends
upon him, Let us pray to God to Comfort, Preſerve and
Bleſs him. Let us accompany his deſigns with our Prayers,
our Vows and our beſt Wiſhes, and with all that lies in our
Power. But if we deſire that our Prayers and our Vows
may be heard, let us put our ſelves into a Condition, that
that we may hope to obtain a Gracious anſwer. Let us uſe
all our Endeavours to perform the Duties that Chriſtianity
enjoyns us, and by obſerving the Commands of God we
ſhall fulfil the Vows of this Pious Queen, who concern'd
her ſelf with ſo much goodneſs to all thoſe who had quitted
their Country for the ſake of Religion. Piety and the Glory
of God which ſhe had always before her Eyes, made her
continually wiſh that Perſons who had ſhew'd their Zeal and
Affection to the Service of God, might do nothing but what
became the Character of that Zeal which had
enclin'd 'em.<note place="margin">This is the Sence of a Letter which the Queen wrote a little before ſhe fell Sick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Mouſſay.</hi>
                     </note> Let us fulfil theſe Wiſhes, ſo juſt
and ſo Chriſtian like. The Incoruptible Crown
of Glory ſhall not be given to him that begins,
but to him that perſeveres. Let us therefore
Labour our Zeal and Fervency while we may,
to the end we may find Grace and Mercy at
the day of our Death; and that we may be made Partakers
of that Bliſs and Eternal Glory which now the Queen enjoys.
That Queen who becauſe ſhe was a Woman that truly feared,
the Lord, deſerves far greater Praiſes then we have been
able to give her.</p>

nor raſhly of my own head, but by the Command of the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Conſuls, what more juſt and reaſonable, what indeed more
neceſſary, than that turning our Faces from men to God, we ſhould
begin with a Prayer addreſs'd to him, to whom the Heathens
themſelves, far remote from the true Worſhip of God, always thought
it proper to make their Invocations at the Threſhold of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?</p>
                  <p>THEE therefore, Omnipotent and Eternal God, without whoſe
aid we can undertake nothing auſpiciouſly, with a mind no leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
and proſtrate, than Body, I implore and ſupplicate, that thou
wilt vouchſafe to look upon this my Oration, not ſacred indeed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
neither impious nor prophane, nor misbecoming the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of this Place, with a Gracious and Favourable Countenance:
And while I rehearſe and commemorate, not ſo much the Praiſes,
as the Vertues of a moſt Pious and Religious Princeſs; not ſo
much her Merits, as thy Benefits; that thou wouldeſt deign to
afford me that Conſtancy, that modeſty, which the Reverence of
this Place, and the Dignity of the Subject requires from me.
Pour down upon me thy Spirit, and inſpire me with a ſparkle of
that Caeleſtial Fire, wherewith of old thou didſt enliven thy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
thoſe Divine Interpreters of thy will; touch my Tongue,
kindle my Breaſt, and ſo Enlighten my mind, ſo temper my words,
that I may utter nothing but what is Grave and Serious, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
this Place, that I may be enabl'd with a be-fitting Fervency,
to Celebrate the Obſequies of this Princeſs, to ſet forth her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and bring to the Propounded End the Work by me begun,
and fulfil the Duty laid upon me, if not with an Applauſe and
Commendation becoming the Subject, yet without diſgrace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

Funeral Oration
OF
Peter Francius, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>AND was this, this then the only diſaſter that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to compleat our Calamities, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of this Republick, continued for ſo many
Years, that in this Condition of Affairs, the War
ſtill raging, and, like a Conflagration, every where Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the ſupport of our Defence, the Conſolation of this
Affliction, the no leſs Beſt than Greateſt of Queens, MARY,
ſhould be violently extorted from the World! Breathleſs,
Breathleſs ſhe lies, ſhe that was the moſt Wiſe and Prudent
Governeſs of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Empire and of this Republick; and
in the half way Race of her Life, in the higheſt Station of
Honour, in the brighteſt ſplendour of Fortune, that far ſhining
Conſtellation is extinguiſh'd. Give Credit, Noble Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
if not to Fame, which rarely in bad tidings deceives us,
if not to your Ears, that ſo often have heard the ſad yet too
true News, however to your Eyes; you have before your
Eyes the ſorrowful Proſpect. The Obſequies are novv pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;
the Queen is novv carried Forth; and vvhatever
in her vvas Corporeal, Frail, Mortal or Terreſtrial, is novv
committed to Enterment and the Earth. The day is come,
is come, the fatal diſmal day has ſpread a gloomy
light o're all the World, that has vvithdravvn from our
ſight the Noble Domicil of her Soul, the Habitation of all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62815:13"/>
Vertues, that ſvveet and amiable Queen, the love of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
Nation the delight of ours, and novv ſhe ſleeps among
her Anceſtors. All <hi>London</hi> follows the Funeral Pomp, and
Enters the Royal Spoiles. Sorrow makes her way through
all the Cities of <hi>Britain;</hi> nor will ſhe be confin'd within
the Limits of one Kingdom; It croſſes the Sea, and ranges
through all the Cities of Confederate <hi>Belgium;</hi> All places
are fill'd with the Sounds of Mournful Knells, with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
lamentation and mourning, and every one diſplays the
Convictions of his Grief. What a number of mournful
Elegies? How many Sermons in Churches, how many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in Academies, and what variety in their complaints?
'Tis a common Lamentation, and a Publick Sorrow. <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neker,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht, Leyden,</hi> and this City, the moſt ſpacious of all
the Reſt, this City alſo is a witneſs of the Univerſal Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>Prudently therefore, and no leſs deeply concern'd, as the
Illuſtrious Governours of thoſe Academies, ſo the moſt Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable
Preſidents of this <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> and the moſt Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable
Conſuls of this City, in this City alſo, under their
own Juriſdiction, and moſt Flouriſhing <hi>Emporium</hi> of the
whole World, thought requiſite to Command a <hi>Funeral
Oration</hi> in Honour of the moſt Serene and Potent Queen of
<hi>England,</hi> and made choice of this Day and Place to Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe
this Ceremony with ſo much the more numerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of People. And indeed what Day more Conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or more Pompous than the ſame which is ſet apart, and
choſen by the King's Council for Publick Lamentation, and
the Funeral Oſequies of the Queen? What place more fit
than this moſt Sacred and Religious, than this the moſt ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Church within theſe Walls? Where could a Princeſs,
ſo Pious and Religious, ſo devoted to God, during the whole
courſe of her Life, be more worthily Applauded, than in
this Place, conſecrated to God and his Sacred Worſhip?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62815:13"/>
Where did ſhe deſerve more properly to be Extoll'd, than in
the Church, which ſhe Erected in her moſt Pious Breaſt, and
the moſt pure receſſes of her Heart, a Structure moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, and a moſt Beautiful Temple? What more
agreeable and Conſentaneous to Reaſon, than that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
of this Princeſs ſhould be ſounded forth from this
Pulpit, from whence the word of God is continually Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the People, and the Oracles and Decrees of Heaven
are daily Promulgated; She who ſo willingly, and
ſo aſſiduouſly frequented ſacred Sermons, and fram'd the
whole courſe of her Life according to thoſe Divine Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
and Precepts, and according to that Rule and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
And I could wiſh that the moſt Noble Fathers
could behold a Perſon no leſs fit to ſpeak, than the Time
and Place is fit for Audience; who when they laid this task
upon me, impos'd a Greater Burthen upon me than my
ſhoulders are able to bear. For it is a Burthen both difficult
and Ponderous, and almoſt ſurpaſſing Human Strength, to
ſet forth the Praiſes of a Princeſs ſo tranſcendently Excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo Abſolute in all Perfections, ſo Adorn'd with all ſorts
of Vertue; that is, to Extol Vertue it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But it behov'd us to Obey; for neither this Obedience to
our Governours, nor this Duty to the Queen, was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
For if that once Victorious and wide Commanding
People, paid this laſt Honour to Illuſtrious Perſons, and ſuch
as well deſerv'd of the Republick; if to their Parents, and
thoſe Related to 'em by any Tye of Blood or Conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and propos'd their Vertues and Endowments as Patterns
and Examples to be followed by themſelves, whom ſhall we
deem more worthy of this Honour, or more deſervedly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,
than the beſt of Princeſs, not recommended to us by any
ſingle Vertue? For what Perſon more Illuſtrious than the
Queen? Who better deſerv'd at our Hands then ſhe? Who
ever Cheriſh'd and foſter'd us with a more Material Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62815:14"/>
than the Publick Parent and Common Mother of us all?
What VVoman e're ſet us an Example of more or greater
Vertues, who was her ſelf a Living Examplar of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue?</p>
                  <p>Seeing then no Woman ever left behind her a more
plentiful Subject for true Panegyrick, nor a juſter cauſe to
bewail her Loſs, unanimouſly join with me moſt noble
Auditors, and let us pay that laſt and only Duty to a Queen
ſo well and highly always deſerving at our Hands, which
our Gratitude and her deſerts demand. I behold your
Aſpects, I view your Countenances and your Eyes, and
Sorrow painted forth in every one: I behold your ſable Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Pulpit hung with Mourning, and methinks I
ſee the Repreſentation of that time, when the renowned
and valiant <hi>Michael Adrian Ruytir,</hi> that Thunderbolt of
War, that terrour of the Ocean, was the Theam of my
Funeral Encomiums, and the Hero, whoſe Obſequies
I had the Honour to ſolemnize. And if that Grief were
juſt and lawful, if his Fall were diſmall to the Republick,
how much more juſt is our Sorrow now, how much deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is the Wound which the Commonwealth has received
by the Death of this Princeſs. This Dart has pierc'd ſo
much more inwardly and deeply to the Marrow, and our
Sorrow is ſo much the more grievous, by how much
the more Illuſtrious the Perſon was whom we deplore.
Certainly we have ſuſtain'd a moſt unſpeakable loſs, not to
be expiated by many Victories; nor has the loſs been
more detrimental to <hi>England</hi> then to thoſe our Provinces.
Both Nations at the ſame time now pay their laſt Duties,
and their laſt Honours to her Memory. Let us accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the Royal Funeral, and as far as it is in our povver, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
her to the Grave it ſelf. And ſince vve cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to behold that Solemnity vvith our Corporeal Eyes,
let us ſet before the Eyes of our Minds thoſe Vertues and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62815:14"/>
Endowments with which ſhe was ſo richly ſtor'd, and let
us view with the Eyes of Contemplation what was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
and Memorable, what was Amiable, Splendid,
Tranſcendent, and truly Royal from the Beginning to the
Exit of her Life. Which while I endeavour to perform,
Think not, noble Auditors, that I intend to implore your
favourable Attention. This numerous Concourſe promiſes
me that already: The Theam of my Oration aſſures me
of it more. For who but had a Love for a Princeſs ſo
Amiable, and who but will honour with his Love a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that ſo highly honour'd all us with her Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Think not that I ſhall aſcribe falſe Praiſes to her, or that
I ſhall make uſe of any Adulteration, or Careſſes of gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Words in extolling her who contemn'd all Adulation,
and Counterfeit Ornament. I will give her her own true,
proper, due Praiſes; and only crop the chiefeſt Heads of
her moſt ſignal Vertues, it being impoſſible for me to make
a full diſplay of all.</p>
                  <p>Come on then, fellow Citizens and Countrymen, come
on, if any preſent, Forreigners and Strangers: attend theſe
great Obſequies; you never attended, never ſhall attend
greater, and unfold with me the Birth, the Life, the Death
of a Queen, the moſt renown'd in the World.</p>
                  <p>And that we may begin from her Cradle, the moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
Queen was born in the ſixty ſecond Year of this Age,
upon the tenth of <hi>May; James</hi> then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the
Lord Chancellor's Daughter being her Parents. If Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of Birth can add any thing of Reputation to her, what
place more famous than <hi>London,</hi> the moſt celebrated Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium
of all <hi>England,</hi> and of all <hi>Europe?</hi> What Family
more illuſtrious than that of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> which plac'd both
<hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> and this his Renown'd Neece upon the
moſt Auguſt Throne of <hi>Great Britain?</hi> And has diffus'd the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62815:15"/>
Splendour of its Race into all parts of the Earth. But as
it was both Noble and Great, to be deſcended from an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Country and Family, ſo was it much more Noble,
much more Great to have adorn'd them with her own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and to have added new Splendor to 'em. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had the Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> ever a more excellent
Woman, nor the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire a more Excellent Princeſs;
who gave more Honour, more Glory to the Royal Dignity
then ſhe receiv'd from it; and as far excell'd all other
Queens, as Queens exceed Private Women.</p>
                  <p>Many, and conſpicuous were the Prognoſticks of a true
and far from counterfeited Piety, that glitter'd in her, and
ſhin'd forth in the early dawn of her Infancy. For when
in her tender Years ſhe had loſt an excellent Mother, and
under the tuition of Perſons leſs concern'd, was deliciouſly
bred up in a Court full of all manner of Pleaſure and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs,
ſuch was always her Conſtancy, ſuch her
Temperance, and Modeſty, that no Example of others,
no Allurement of Vice, no Contagion of Neighbouring Courts
could force her to go aſtray from the right Path. <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second cheriſh'd theſe ſparks of Vertue, and Seeds of Piety,
and that he might alienate her from the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
commanded her to be inſtructed in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of the true Reform'd Religion by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi>
which he ſo happily laid, and ſhe ſo cordially imbib'd, that
ſhe could never be ſhaken by any Treacherous Inſinuations,
any Promiſes or Threats, any Puniſhments or Rewards;
chooſing rather to dye, then never ſo little to receed from the
Truth, wherein ſhe had been grounded.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe had ſpent the reſt of her Childhood in thoſe
Studies, by which generous and illuſtrious Souls are rais'd to
the Expectations of great Fortune, and had abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
herſelf as well with Chriſtian as with Royal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
in the fifteenth year of her Age, ſhe was auſpicionſly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62815:15"/>
Marry'd to <hi>William</hi> the third of that Name, Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
Governour of thoſe our United Provinces, a Prince
no leſs renown'd for his Vertues, and his far fam'd At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
then for the Images of his Anceſtors, and a
long Series of Pedigree. <hi>William</hi> Marries <hi>Mary,</hi> a Kinſman
a Kinſwoman; and thus by a double Tye, and a firmer Knot
then hitherto, the moſt noble Families of all <hi>Europe</hi> are joyn'd
together. She, for her Anceſtors claims the Family of the
<hi>Stuarts;</hi> he, the <hi>Naſſavian</hi> Race; She, the Monarchs of
<hi>Great Britain;</hi> He, the Governours of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the
<hi>Caeſars</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Nuptial Solemnities being over, the Royal Bride
croſs'd over out of <hi>England</hi> into theſe Parts, together with
her Husband, and choſe for her Seat and Reſidence, the
<hi>Hague,</hi> the moſt pleaſant and delightful place, not only of
<hi>Holland,</hi> but almoſt of all <hi>Europe,</hi> firſt of all the Seat of the
Counts of <hi>Holland,,</hi> afterwards of the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi>
and native Country of this Prince; where belov'd of all
Men, and fix'd in the Good-will of all the People propenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devoted to her, for the ſpace of ſome Years, ſhe ſo
charmingly and affectionately liv'd with her Husband, the
beſt of Men, and no leſs cordially affectionate to her, not
only without the leaſt contention or quarrel, but without the
leaſt ſuſpicion of Luke-warmneſs, that ſhe might well be
ſaid to be a conſpicuous example of Conjugal Affection,
not only to Kings, and Princes, and Men in high Degree,
but alſo to private Perſons. By which Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
not only the Perſons who contracted it, but both
People and Nations, and the Countries themſelves, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
divided by the Sea and the Interflowing Ocean, were
combin'd together by a ſtronger League of Friendſhip and
Society then before, and a ſtricter tye of Amity.</p>
                  <p>After ſome Interval of Time, when they who bare ill
will to our Princes and us, to Liberty and Religion, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62815:16"/>
more eſpecially to this Republick, ſtirr'd up new Troubles
in <hi>England,</hi> and the Nobility of the Kingdom call'd to their
Aid our Prince, who was only able to apply a Remedy to
the growing Miſchief; and that our moſt undaunted Hero,
undertaking a vaſt and abſolutely <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour, ſuch
as will ſcarce find credit with Poſterity, not without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
altogether divine, while he ſtrove one way, and the
Winds drove another, at length wafted over with favourable
Gales and Wiſhes, ſafely arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> and without
Reſiſtance, but rather with the general Applauſe of the
Nation, and as it were born upon the Shoulders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
came to the Royal City: when afterwards he invited
his deareſt Conſort, then the Companion of his Bed, now
of his Kingdom, to partake of the Honour offer'd him, and
the Dignity ſoon after to be conferr'd upon him, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
ſhare of his Fortune, in the eighty ninth Year of this
Age, luckily and auſpiciouſly both Husband and Wife were
declar'd King and Queen, with equal Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by the common Vote and Suffrage, and unanimous
Conſent of both Houſes.</p>
                  <p>What was then the Grief of theſe People, when not
without ſighs and Tears, and Sobs interrupted with grief,
when a Princeſs ſo dearly beloved, ſet Sail from this Shoar,
and left this her ſo well belov'd Country, never to return:
What was then the Joy of thoſe People, when ſhe arriv'd
upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt; when the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>
beheld their Future Queen, what Crouding, what Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes,
what Acclamations, is more eaſie to be imagin'd
than to be related, or comprehended in Words.</p>
                  <p>But when the King was to ſubdue <hi>Ireland;</hi> when our
Great General was frequently to croſs the Seas, in order to
withſtand the Common Enemy of <hi>Europe;</hi> with what pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
did ſhe adminiſter the Grand Affairs? how wiſely, and
adviſedly govern the Kingdom, and with what Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62815:16"/>
confirm the Minds of the People? Witneſs that Diſmal
and Fatal Day, when upon the Tydings of the Navy ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
at Sea, and of the threatned Invaſion of the Enemy
by Land, like an Armed <hi>Minerva,</hi> ſhe rode through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
raiſed the dejected Spirits of the People, reſtored Life
and Courage to all, and muſter'd her ſelf the Soldiers deſign'd
for the Guard of the Coaſts. Witneſs <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi>
and that other Town upon the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> by the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet which her induſtrious Care ſet
forth, laid in Ruines, and thunder'd into Aſhes. Witneſs
Both Houſes of Parliament, that return'd Thanks to their
Queen upon that occaſion, and openly and publickly expreſs'd
the ſentiments of their Hearts in words at large. So that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were hardly ſenſible of the abſence of their King; nor
nor was there any thing which they wanted, but only the
Perſon of the King.</p>
                  <p>Thus for ſeveral Years this Royal Heroeſs held a Divided
Empire between her Royal Husband and her ſelf. She rul'd
<hi>England,</hi> while <hi>William</hi> govern'd <hi>Belgium,</hi> till toward the end
of the preceeding Year, ſhe began to ſink under the firſt Aſſaults
of a Terrrible Diſeaſe; which tho it ſlacken'd at the Beginning,
afterwards every Day prevailing more and more, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
hour approaching, after ſhe had bid adieu to Royal Pomp
and all Earthly Affairs, ſhe betook her ſelf to pious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
plac'd her only hopes in God alone, and to him commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her ſoul.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, together with ſeveral others of the ſame
Order, the Pious and moſt Reverend Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> viſited her, who obſerving how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ill ſhe was, and for that Reaſon, with pious and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Exhortations, putting her in mind in her approaching
End, with an undaunted Countenance, ſhe return'd him this
maſculine and truly royal expreſſion, <hi>I am not now to prepare for
Death; it has been my ſtudy all the days of my Life.</hi> Then the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62815:17"/>
gave her the Memorial of the Divine Body, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our <hi>Militia.</hi> Which having received, after ſhe had
given her laſt, and never to be repeated Embraces to her
moſt Dear Husband, ſhe compos'd her ſelf altogether to die,
and between the ſixth and ſeventh of <hi>January,</hi> about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
in the Royal Palace of <hi>Kenſington,</hi> piouſly and placid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expiring, ſurrender'd her chaſt ſoul to God, as became ſo
Devout a Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>Oh Black and Diſmal Night! O horrid Day that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and blacker than the Night it ſelf! Fallacious Hopes!
and Vain Cogitations, even of Kings themſelves! The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
ſooty with the Duſt and Smoak of War, and tyr'd with
the Labours of a Tedious Campaign, delighted in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of his Beloved Conſort, and thought to have waſted
the Winter Hours in her Society. But his Wiſhes were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed:
Inſtead of Joy he meets with Sorrow, Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſtead of Applauſe, and finds a Funeral where he thought
to have met a Wife. His otherwiſe Invincible Courage,
gives way to Raging Grief; and he who had ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
the Bullets and Swords of his Enemies; he who
dreaded neither Flames nor Steel, nor Death it ſelf, Langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
Falls, and Swoons away upon the Death of his Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Queen. He remembers himſelf to be but a <hi>King,</hi> finds
himſelf a Man, and not unwilling, acknowledges the Exceſs
of his Grief. <hi>Miſerable man that I am,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have loſt the
beſt of Women, and the moſt pleaſing Companion of my Life!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was that ſo much the Expoſing of Love as of Truth
it ſelf: For all that knew her, acknowledg this Queen to have
been the beſt and moſt Excellent of Women, endu'd with
all Royal and Chriſtian Virtues, and Adorn'd with all the
Graces both of Body and Mind.</p>
                  <p>And altho theſe Bleſſings of the Mind are really ſolid and
ſempiternal Bleſſings, far to be prefer'd before the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Body; yet Vertue ſhines more Beautifully, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62815:17"/>
more pleaſingly inſinuates it ſelf into us from a Graceful and
Beautiful Body, after a manner not to be expreſs'd. Which
if it be true in private Perſons, how much more in Princes,
in whom that Excellency and Grace of Body charms and adds
to the Allurements of Dignity by unknown and ſecret Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations.
For ſeeing that the moſt Beautiful Workmanſhip
of God is Man, and the more excellent part of Man is the
Mind; how rare a thing and how tranſcendent is it to carry a
beautiful Mind in a beautiful Structure of Body, and to how
few Mortals doth that perfection happen? But in the Queen
both theſe Perfections were Eminent. For ſhe had a
ſtructure of Body to Admiration; Taller than uſual, well
ſhap'd, well proportion'd, and Majeſtick. Correſpondent to
her Body was her Face, becomming Empire and Command.
A radiant Beauty overſpead her Countenance, and the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants
of Beauty, Grace, a Royal Majeſty, and a certain
ſeverity, temper'd with a mild ſerenity: You might know
her to be a Queen by her Aſpect. But a much nobler gueſt
Inhabited this Domicil; a mind more Lovely than her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
from whence, as from a perpetual Fountain, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unexhauſted Spring, all other both Royal and Chriſtian
Vertues exuberantly Flow'd; which how many, how tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
and Illuſtrious they were, their Enumeration and
Contemplation will make manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, How extraordinary was her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and her inſight into all Affairs? How quick and ſmart
her judgment in diſcerning? How great her Memory in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining?
With what a Fortitude endow'd in undertaking?
With what a Reſolution to Execute? What an Elevation
of mind? On the other ſide, how Mild, how Gentle, how
Clement, how Courteous? How Affable? How Good,
and what an inbred and natural Benignity towards all Men?
How Prudent and Wiſe in adminiſtring the Affairs of the
Kingdom? How ſevere and juſt in the determination of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62815:18"/>
Differences? In the Diſtribution of Puniſhments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
How munificent and liberal to the Poor? How
ſingularly modeſt? How frugal and temperate in the midſt
of the Temptations of Life, and in the Pleaſures of a Court?
That hardly ever any private Perſon leſs indulg'd her ſelf,
than a Princeſs advanced to ſuch an Illuſtrious Station of
Honour and Dignity.</p>
                  <p>But nothing was more Illuſtrious in her, nothing more
commendable, or more deſerving Admiration and Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
among ſo many and ſo great Vertues, than that prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and above all tranſcending Vertue, real and ſincere Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
which the wiſeſt of Kings adjudg'd to be the beginning
of all Wiſdom. There was nothing which ſhe eſteem'd
more Religiouſly incumbent upon her, than to ſerve the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
God, and be aſſiduous in his Worſhip; to defend,
maintain and propagate, with all the Force of her Kingdom,
the true Religion purg'd and purified from Idols and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.
Nor was it her Opinion, that piety conſiſted in the
Lips, but in the Heart; not in ſubtil Diſputes, but in good
Works; not in the Knowledg but the Obſervation of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and in the Cordial Performance of enjoyn'd Duties.
Nor was it her choice with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> rather to know
than do that which was right; but with the Antient <hi>Cato,</hi>
tho more truly than he, rather to be good, than to ſeem ſo.
In the morning ſhe roſe with the Sun, and Worſhip'd the
Lord of Heaven and Earth. But when ſhe was ſometimes
forc'd to riſe at midnight, by reaſon of the Urgent Affairs
of the State, and could not afterwards ſleep, ſhe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either the Holy Scripture, or ſome other Pious Book, to be
brought her. If any perſons came to Viſit her in a morning
before ſhe had pour'd forth her Prayers, ſhe ſent 'em back
with this Expreſſion, <hi>That ſhe was firſt to ſerve the King of
Kings.</hi> If any perſons were ſaid to ſeek her Life by Treachery
and Conſpiracy, her Anſwer was, <hi>That ſhe ſubmitted to the
Will of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62815:18"/>
She was ever preſent at Publick Congregations, eſpecially
when the Army was in motion, and ſome more imminent
dangers threatned.</p>
                  <p>And when ſhe was there, no perſon more attentive to the
Preacher, no perſon pour'd forth more fervent Prayers to
God, with a mind, rather than a Countenance Dejected and
fix'd upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Then, how benificent, how bountiful, both in the Church,
and without it, to the wanting Members of the Church, in
all Parts of the Earth? How many thouſands did ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
at her own Charges, which that ſame horrid Tempeſt,
and diſmal Rage of the Monks, which they call Piety, had
driven into theſe Countrys, or into <hi>England,</hi> Exiles from
their Native Country, and depriv'd of the Liberty of their
Conſciences, much dearer than their Country? Who, laſtly,
ever was in real Want, to whoſe Succour ſomething did not
always flow from that abounding Fountain? Four times
every year, ſhe ſent Letters, Subſcrib'd with her own Hand,
with Mony to be diſtributed to the Poor, from whom ſhe
never deſir'd the Repayment of Thanks. 'Tis not above
three years ſince, that ſhe ſent a vaſt Sum of Mony into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for the Relief of the Poor, and to ſupply the neceſſities of
a bitter Winter, concealing her Name, according to her
Cuſtom. Benign and Munificent Princeſs! Give thou
wouldſt, but yet conceal thy Name: Hadſt thou been now
alive, how many poor and indigent, that Periſh'd through
the intenſe Rigour of this laſt Winter, had been then reliev'd
by thy moſt Royal Bounty?</p>
                  <p>But as ſhe Conſecrated her firſt and chiefeſt Duties to God,
her next ſhe Dedicated to her Husband. How Lovingly did
ſhe Accompany him at his Departure? How affectionately
did ſhe Embrace him Returning? With how much Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Sweetneſs did ſhe Compenſate the Hardſhips of
War, and continual Travel by him ſtuſtain'd? This laſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62815:19"/>
time, unhappy laſt Time! With what an incredible ſpeed
and Fervency, contemning the Injuries of the Weather, did
ſhe haſten to meet her deareſt Conſort, and Congratulate
his ſafe Return? While the King was abſent, ſhe alone took
care of all the Affairs of the Kingdom: When he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ſhe ceaſed to meddle with any Publick Buſineſs, but
ſurrendred back the Government of the whole Empire into
his Hand; more joyful to reſign it, than to take it up. So
that never any Mother of a Family could be more obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to her Husband, than ſhe was to the King.</p>
                  <p>Nor are you to believe, ſhe waſted that Life in idleneſs.
She had buſineſs enough to do. She oblig'd all People by
her Favours. She ſtudied to deſerve the love of all men:
She Cur'd the Sick; ſhe ſuccoured the Afflicted; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
Relief to all that were in Want, or that Laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any Calamity of Body. Of Time, ſo pretious, and the
only thing of which we may be laudably allow'd to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
ſhe was moſt ſparing and parcimonious. Many
times ſhe ſet her Royal Hands to Embroider; which ſhe
did not think beneath her ſelf, in imitation of the Antient
Queens. VVhen at the ſame time (give ear great <hi>Seneca,</hi>
who ſo highly commendeſt to us Covetouſneſs of Time) ſhe
order'd to be read to her ſome profitable and learned Piece,
which treated either of Politicks, or Hiſtory, of Ethicks, or
of Divinity. She her ſelf alſo Read very much, whether in
the City or the Country, and with honeſt, yet delightful eaſe
deceiv'd her ſolitary Hours; ſo that like the great <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi>
ſhe was never leſs at leiſure, than when at leiſure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leſs alone than when alone; and like that other <hi>Scipio,</hi>
Advantageouſly and Elegantly divided her Intervals of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Buſineſs. An Egregious Act, enough to ſhame not
only VVomen, not only Youth, but Men of Years and
Learning. Nor was it long ſince (give Ear ye Kings and
Princes) that ſhe Erected in her Palace, a Library peculiar
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62815:19"/>
to her ſelf; a Precedent but rarely heard of before; and
had furniſh'd it, not ſo much with Gaudy as with uſeful
Books. Thence had ſhe drawn a copious Stock of Learning;
deeply Read in Hiſtory, and no leſs skill'd in Architecture,
and Geometry: So that the Situations of all Countries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
Cities and Seaport-Towns were familiar to her.</p>
                  <p>And ſhe, who expended ſo much upon the Worſhip of
God, her Duty to her Husband, upon the People, and upon
all in Neceſſity; how much did ſhe Expend upon her ſelf?
She ſpent all upon her Mind; took little or no care of her
Body. VVhen any new faſhion'd Garment, or coſtly Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſhewed her, ſhe rejected 'em as ſuperfluous, and
Anſwered, <hi>The Mony might be better laid out upon the Poor.</hi>
Wonderful Princeſs, endu'd with ſo Pious and Modeſt a
Mind! Great Exemplar, fit for Imitation! She beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Poor, ſhe denies her ſelf, ſhe contemns, ſo great
and Potent a Princeſs neglects and ſcorns thoſe Things,
which all other private Women ſo ardently and vehemently
covet and deſire.</p>
                  <p>Which ſhall I moſt admire amidſt ſo many, and ſo great
Vertues? Whether that extraordinary Piety towards God,
that ſhun ſo brightly forth in her tender Years; while
never Woman worſhip'd, lov'd, and honour'd God with
a more fervent or purer zeal? Whether that ſacred, and
Praiſe-worthy Deſire of promoting Religion, upon which
ſhe was ſo ſingularly intent, that without the Providence
of God, and the Care and Vigilance of this our Princeſs,
we ſhould have hardly had any ſtirring by this? Whether
that moſt ardent Conjugal Love, wherein ſhe far exceeded
<hi>Cyrus</hi>'s <hi>Panthaea, Mauſolius</hi>'s <hi>Artemiſia,</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s
<hi>Hypſicrataea?</hi> Whether that Prudence and Wiſdom in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,
wherein ſhe ſurpaſs'd not only Women, but
many famous Men? Whether her Equity in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Juſtice; while Men lookt upon her as Superiour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62815:20"/>
to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> to <hi>Phocian,</hi> and deem'd her to be Juſtice her
ſelf? Whether that Benign, both Mind and Countenance
that equall'd her with <hi>Socrates,</hi> and his Imperial Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor
<hi>Antoninus,</hi> while her deportment was affable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent
to all ſorts and degrees of People; fully convinc'd
that nothing could be more Royal than the Saying of that
moſt excellent Prince, and Emperor, moſt like herſelf, that
it behov'd her not to let any Perſon depart ſad from her
Preſence? VVhether that Modeſty and Temperance, that
Frugality in ſo great an Exuberancy of Fortune; by means
of which ſhe ſtood impregnable to all the Temptations,
and <hi>Circaean</hi> Sorceries of a Vicious Court, nor could be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from the Paths of true Vertue? So that her Court
ſeem'd not to be the Manſion of a Queen, but the Houſe
of ſome private Matron, or rather the Temple of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity;
by which means ſhe made the Bad Good, as is ſaid
of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Philoſopher, the Good Better and like her
ſelf? Or whether her Clemency, and good Nature prone to
win the Good-will of all People; ſo that ſhe was no leſs
griev'd than they who Petition'd, if it ſo fell out that ſhe
could not grant their Requeſts; and like that moſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Prince, thought that day loſt wherein ſhe was not
kind to ſome body or other? Or that tranſcendent Benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
her Compaſſion, and that Motherly Affection of a
Munificent Princeſs to the Sick and Poor, whoſe charitable
Deeds, like thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Centurion may be thought
to have aſcended up into Heaven? Or laſtly, that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and more than Maſculine Magnanimity and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as well through the whole Courſe of her Life, as at her
Death? Who among the pooreſt, and moſt miſerable ever
with more eaſineſs reſign'd this mortal Life, ſo obnoxious to
a Thouſand Calamities, than She, in the midſt of Regal Pomp,
and plenty with a Royal, and truly Heroick Mind, contemn'd
and ſurrender'd all the Pleaſures of Life, and Regal Dignity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62815:20"/>
and haſten'd to the Supream King of Heaven and Earth,
by whom ſhe had been only ſent us hitherto? How many
proofs did ſhe manifeſt of a Mind undaunted, joyful, and
deſirous to leave this Life? How many clear and evident
Demonſtrations did ſhe give of her Love to God? How
comfortably did ſhe addreſs herſelf to the King and the
reſt of the ſtanders by? How well aſſured of Eternal Life
and Immortality did ſhe bid farewell to this Life, and all
Terreſtrial Felicities, and tranſmigrate to that ſame only
Fountain, and perpetual Spring of all Beatitude? So that
her Life and Death was a moſt perfect and conſummate
Exemplar of Vertue and Piety: Nor did Nature ever
produce any thing more excellent than ſhe, who in all her
Life never did, never ſaid or thought any thing but
what was Praiſe-worthy; ſo that what was ſaid of <hi>Scipio
Aemilianus</hi> may be more truly recorded of our Princeſs, whoſe
Vertues were ſo many, ſo great, and of that moment eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, that no Man ever durſt preſume ſo much as tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beg of the Immortal God, as this our Queen obtain'd
from the moſt indulgent Diſpenſer of all Good.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the mind of Man is better diſcern'd by
his Death than by his Life; for Man is apt in his Life
time to conceal and diſſemble his Affections; but at his
Death the Mask being remov'd, he appears what he is;
what was more noble or ſignal than the Death of this
Queen? What more becoming a Wiſe Man and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
than that ſaying of hers, <hi>This is not the firſt time that
I prepar'd my ſelf for Death.</hi> Great Sentence! moſt worthy a
Philoſopher and a Pious Man! What more does Philoſophy
teach us, what more the Chriſtian Religion! For if Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
be meditation upon Death, as rightly of old the
<hi>Platonics</hi> obſerv'd; if we muſt be always learning to dye,
according to the <hi>Stoies,</hi> may not ſhe be ſaid to have liv'd
a <hi>Philoſophical Life,</hi> and the likeſt to <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf, who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62815:21"/>
during the whole courſe of her Life, was always medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon Death? <hi>Socrates</hi> is every where lovely, every
where appears a Vertuous and Holy Man, but no where
more lovely or greater, than at his <hi>Exit,</hi> and at his death
which he ſo generouſly ſought, by which he immortaliz'd
his Vertue and Integrity, and confirm'd what he had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
taught, not by Words but Deeds, and his Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Exit</hi> out of this Life. How much a more ſignal and
Laudable Teſtimony of her Vertue and Sanctity, than that
Philoſopher, did our Queen give to the World by her death,
ſo Heroick, and to be imitated by all Chriſtians? Who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
not a private, not a miſerable, but a Royal Life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in all delights, without the leaſt repining; who
ſo departed this Life as from a Banquet; efcap'd from the
Court as out of a Priſon; who more aſſur'd of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of her Soul, and the hopes of a better Life, with a
greater Reſolution, did not inflict a ſpontaneous Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
herſelf, but expected a decreed Stroak from the Hand of
the Supream Lord of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who forbids us to quit our
Stations uncommanded by himſelf; and beheld the common
Enemy of Mankind, the moſt terrible of all moſt terrible
things, with a Mind altogether undaunted, and a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
nothing terrified. No wonder ſhe had learnt to dye,
it had been her only Study. She underſtood the Frailty
of Life, like Glaſs, the brighter the more brittle. She knew
that we dy'd every day; that the beginning of Life was the
beginning of Death; that there was nothing firm and
Stable here; that we are promis'd another Life, conſtant, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and and permanent; that Death is but the Paſſage to it;
that no Man can dye well, but he that liv'd well; that no
Man lives well but he that has Death always before his Eyes,
and has learnt to dye well. Our Princeſs fill'd with theſe
Cogitations, ſcorn'd and repudiated all the conveniences and
blandiſhments of Life, Honors and Dignities, Scepters and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62815:21"/>
Diadems, and whatever Men deem Fortunate; and with a
great and Royal Mind while ſhe liv'd, contemn'd Life,
and Death when ſhe dy'd: and by ſo doing, nobly and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
triumph'd over both.</p>
                  <p>Renown'd Woman of a Maſculine, and Couragious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
victorious over Death it ſelf! By what name
ſhall I call thee? Whether Parent of thy Country, formerly
the Sirname aſcrib'd to <hi>Livia,</hi> bnt more truly to be given
to thee? Whether Auguſt, which was attributed to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empreſſes, but due to thy Merit, than which nothing
was more Sacred, nothing more Auguſt? Or the beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
which was firſt allow'd to <hi>Scipio Maſica,</hi> afterwards
to <hi>Trajan,</hi> by decree of the Senate: An Epithete, that muſt
never be renew'd again, now thou art gone, nor will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Earth without the Remembrance of thy Vertues?
Or the Defendreſs of the Faith, a Title more truly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to Thee, than to Him, to whom it was firſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
Moſt Holy and Religious Princeſs, before whom no
Woman is to be preferr'd!</p>
                  <p>Let ſacred and prophane Hiſtories recommend to us the
Fortitude of <hi>Deborah,</hi> the Charity of <hi>Dorcas;</hi> the Prudence
of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and her Knowledge how to Govern; the
Couragious Soul of <hi>Zenobia,</hi> and her fervent Love of Learn-the
incredible Endowments both of Body and Mind in <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſia,</hi>
and her ſingular Modeſty; the Piety of <hi>Placilla,</hi> and
her aſſiduous care of the Needy and Sick; let the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Annals extol their <hi>Maud,</hi> their <hi>Philippa,</hi> their <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and
their tranſcending Vertues; neither Antiquity, nor this our
modern Age can boaſt of any thing that is to be compar'd
with this our far ſurpaſſing Queen, worthy of far greater
Encomiums. What ſingly they poſſeſs'd, this had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatively
crouded in one Perſon, as being a Compendium
of all thoſe Vertues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62815:22"/>
For my part, when I revolve all theſe things in my Mind,
and diligently weigh the particular Vertues of this ſingle Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I am plainly and evidently convinc'd that never any
thing was produc'd in this world more excellent than this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
nor that ever any greater Bleſſing happen'd to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
For if that ſaying of <hi>Plato</hi> be true, as 'tis moſt certain,
that Cities then will have an end of all their miſeries, when
great Power and Prudence, by a certain divine State, meet
with mutual Embraces with Equity and Juſtice; if the
VVorld ſhall then be happy, as the ſame Author aſſerts, when
either Kings are wiſe, or wiſe Men Reign, how happy and
fortunate would have been our Republick, and the People and
Nations committed to her care, who with ſo much
prudence and wiſdom govern'd her Kingdom; who with ſo
much Juſtice and Equity temper'd her Power; who in that
high Station of her Fortune never did harm to any Man,
when ſhe had ſo much Power to injure; whoſe Humility
contended with her majeſty, whoſe Clemency with her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
and whoſe Goodneſs with her ſupream Authority;
who thought herſelf ſo much Greater, by how much ſhe
was better than others, as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> who
ſplendidly and wiſely govern'd Cities and People, then which
Knowledge how to Reign well, <hi>Diocleſian</hi> from his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
was wont to affirm, that there was not any Art or
Science more difficult to be learnt? And if <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi>
were ſtil'd of old the Buckler of the Empire, <hi>Marcellus</hi> the
Sword, do we not behold the true and genuine Effigies of
our King and Queen in theſe two illuſtrious Captains; of
which he, like <hi>Marcellus</hi> defends us with his Sword; ſhe like
<hi>Fabius</hi> protected us with her Buckler, and holding in the
one hand her Spear, her Shield in the other, now repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our Eyes the Armed <hi>Pallas,</hi> then again the gentle and
Pacifick <hi>Minerva,</hi> as well the Goddeſs of Prudence as of
War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62815:22"/>
Laſtly, if man were made after the Image of God; if
Kings are ordain'd of God; if the moſt conſpicuous vertues
of the ſupream Deity are his Immenſe Goodneſs and Power,
how evidently did our Auguſt Queen repreſent the Image
of God both in her words and deeds? How piouſly did ſhe
perform her Vicegerency? How nearly imitate his Vertues?
VVho greateſt in power, beſt in Goodneſs juſtly deſerv'd to
be call'd the <hi>Beſt</hi> and <hi>Greateſt</hi> of Princeſſes, by a holy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
and common to her with God himſelf? For he
is <hi>Optimus Maximus,</hi> the <hi>Greateſt Beſt,</hi> but firſt he is call'd
the <hi>Beſt,</hi> and then the <hi>Greateſt.</hi> By which what other did
Antiquity ſignifie to us, but that this was the chief Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
proper to God, and that he had no Attribute more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than his Goodneſs? This chief and primary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the ſupream Deity who among Mortals more truly
ever imitated than our Queen? Who as ſhe had receiv'd
ſupremacy of Power from God, ſo likewiſe a Will propenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclin'd to deſerve well of all Men; who diſtributed the
Gifts conferr'd upon her from Heaven, for the common Good,
and Benefit of All; who ſhew'd herſelf not only a munificent
Queen, but a certain Divinity viſible upon Earth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
to our Eyes; ſo that the People committed to her
Care might know and be ſenſible that they liv'd under <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY,</hi>
the moſt Pious and upright, that is to ſay, the Beſt, and
ſurpaſſing all the beſt in her Kind.</p>
                  <p>Such a Princeſs therefore, ſo excellent, and ſo far as Vertue
can be underſtood, ſo admirable and Tranſcending we have
loſt; who by ſweetneſs of Manners, and by her ſingular Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
and Beneficence had won the Love of all people. The
<hi>Engliſh</hi> lov'd her, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> lov'd her, and as ſhe ſo
lov'd both Nations, that it was hard to diſcover which the
beſt, ſo the people of both Nations reverenc'd her with an
equal Affection; only the ſtrife between 'em was, who lov'd
her moſt Fervently. Nor had ſhe only engag'd the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62815:23"/>
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and other Nations ſubjected to her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but among Foreigners and Strangers, ſhe had alſo won
the favour and good-will of all People; all Men extoll'd that
Woman whom no man ever ſpoke ill of, unleſs he were
at the ſame time the profeſs'd Enemy of all Vertue.</p>
                  <p>But as ſhe was then the Love of all Nations, the delight
of both People; ſo is ſhe now the Subject of their Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
She is now become the publick and common grief
of all Men. However there is that Conſolation ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
among us, which if it cannot abſolutly aſſwage, yet
well may ſerve to alleviate and mitigate our Sorrow. We
have a King ſtill living, ſtrong and healthy, who being ſafe,
we may believe that God has not altogether caſt us from our
Protection. We have Peers, and the Nobility and Gentry
of the Kingdom, who with all the King's Forces, all his
warlike preparations, both at home and abroad, both by Land
and Sea, will carry on the War. We have our own Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
ſtrong, flouriſhing, potent, and equally ſuſtaining the
burthens of the VVar. VVe have our powerful Allies and
Friends, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> join'd together
with us in the ſame League and Confederacy of War. But
above all things we have the Supream God of Heaven and
Earth, propitious and favourable to the Religious Cauſe of
his People; through whoſe aſſiſtance we promiſe better
things for the future, and a proſperous Iſſue of this War.
But onr Mourning exceeds all Conſolation, nor will our grief
for the death of our beſt Princeſs endure that any Reſtraint
ſhould be put upon it; a Princeſs, whom Nations at length
begin to value, now that they have loſt her. She is now tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
to a better place, and freed from the fetters of this
mortal and periſhing Body, has exchanged for an immortal,
this frail Life, a Terreſtrial for a Celeſtial Kingdom, and all
her Royal Splendor upon Earth for a far brighter Glory;
where with Holy Quire of the Bleſſed, and her Illuſtrious
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62815:23"/>
Anceſtors ſhe poſſeſſes the Fruition of never ceaſing Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſempiternal Joy, leaving only to us Tears and
Lamentation, a long laſting Sorrow, and as a grateful, ſo a
ſad and mournful Remembrance of her. The King bewails

the Church a Defendreſs; Widows and Orphans a Foſter-Mother,
the miſerable, the needy, and the ſick a true ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and all a Mother and a Parent. Moſt certainly we
have loſt a Mother and a Parent, our Mother and Parent;
who as ſhe had by many Merits and Benefits engag'd the
Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and our Republick, with the true Worſhip
of God, the Reform'd Religion purg'd from <hi>Roman</hi> Contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
all honeſt and laudable Arts and Sciences, ſo would
ſhe have heap'd upon 'em greater Obligations, greater Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
had the ſupream Arbiter of all things vouchſafed her eaſe,
Peace, and a longer Life. Now we have loſt the Harveſt
of the preſent time, and the hopes of the future: Novv vve
are ſenſible of a double loſs; now we bewail, deplore, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Beſt and moſt Excellent of Princeſſes, ſnatch'd
from us by a Death untimely and fatal to us all. And
though it become us not to diſturb her Celeſtial Joys with
our importunate and troubleſome means, ſince our Tears
can never recal her, however who will not be ſo indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to our Humane Weakneſs, as to pardon us the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at ſo Calamitous a Funeral? Who in the midſt of
general Sorrow and Lamentation can refrain from publick
Tears? Theſe are the laſt Offices which are due
to her; and this day appointed for Univerſal Mourning.
But the reſt muſt be reſerv'd till another time, as being
dedicated to the Muſes, who muſt then be the Cloſe
Mourners.</p>

                  <p>WHere e're I look about me, 'tis not the bare Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of Sadneſs, and Forlorn Diſconſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ſtrikes my Eyes. For Two Months
together, the greateſt part of the Northern
World has lain cover'd with Snow, and harden'd with Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Cold; and Navigable Rivers have ſtopt their Courſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62815:27"/>
condens'd and congeal'd by ſharp contracting Froſts, while we
could hardly warm our ſelves, nor defend our Bodies from the
Rigour of the Seaſon, tho profuſly furniſh'd with comfortable
Fires. Nor could we ſilently brook, nor diſſemble our Regret
for being depriv'd the Fruit of Commerce and Pleaſure, and for
being ſeated in ſuch a deſert Solitude. But when we conſider
the approaching Change, when it would ſoon come to paſs,
that the Plough'd Fields, Fetter'd in Chains of Ice, would be
ſet free by the warm Weſtern Gales, that the Frozen Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
in all the Hoary Mountains, Roads and Streets, would
ſoon melt away, diſſolv'd by the Sun's aſcending Heat, and
that the Rivers, their Ponderous Weight remov'd, would
haſten with an unbridl'd Torrent to the Sea, and reinforce
our Trade, abounding and Wealthy in all ſorts of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
which the perverſeneſs of the Seaſon had obſtructed;
that the conceal'd Seed, the Husbandman's Expectation, would
ſoon riſe up above the Earth; that the Birds would chear
the Tepid Air with their Harmonious Notes; and that the
Flocks and Herds would ſoon be ſporting and wantoning in our
Delightful Meadows, this readily induces us to take in good
part this Spectacle of Complaint and Horror, without Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or Tears. The Reaſon is, becauſe the Severity of the
hard Seaſon is allay'd by a certain Expectation of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
time when all things will revive and flouriſh. But when
I behold the moſt Illuſtrious Orders, the Fathers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
Perſonages in High Stations, and Exerciſing the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Function of the Commonwealth, clouded in Sable
Mourning, and Ponder in my Thoughts the Occaſion of that
ſame Doleful Habit, I perceive our ſelves ſubjected to a much
profounder Grief, ſcarce capable of Conſolation, which no
Circumvalation of Years can repair, and which all good
Men, the Exact Adorers of Truth and Juſtice can hardly
brook with Patience. There is not any one among ye, Moſt
Noble Auditors, who has not heard me ſpeak of the Late Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Death of a Queen, who neither had, nor will have
her Equal, or her Second upon Earth. So that when I had
fully reſolv'd, theſe Brumal Holydays, to attone the Muſes,
and Sincerely to have reconciled my ſelf to their Favour, at
other times diſtracted with my publick and private Schools, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62815:27"/>
Publick Sorrow interrupted me; but more eſpecially my City
of <hi>Delph,</hi> which, no unprofitable Citizen, I ſtudy with all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
to ſerve, whiſper'd me in the Ear, and thus ſeem'd to
Expoſtulate with me. What! when the greateſt part of the
Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> have laid ſo deep to heart the Loſs of the
Queen, and that their Temples, and their private Houſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded
with numerous Orations and Epicediums, both in
Proſe and Verſe; muſt I, the Metropolis, once Conſpicuous
for the <hi>Naſſovian</hi> and <hi>Orangian</hi> Princes, and ſtill entruſted with
their Sacred <hi>Mauſoleums,</hi> with a Religious Silence only cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Obſequies of this moſt Serene Queen? Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it. And though I am not capable to enumerate all the
Vertues of this Auguſt Exemplar of Woman-kind, yet I ſhall
preſume to draw 'em in Minature, tho with a Rude and far
from Magiſterial Pencil, and pronounc'd not from my own
but from the Lips of all men that live in this, or in the other
Hemiſphere; and who are equal ſufferers by this deadly
Wound.</p>
                  <p>In Obedience therefore to my moſt Honoured and Beloved
City, demanding only what is Juſt and Equitable, I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
the performance of this mournful duty; afraid how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſo diſconſolate and caſt down with Sorrow, as I am, leſt
my Sobs ſhould interrupt my Words, and obſtruct the paſſage
of my Speech. Which if it ſhould come to paſs, I beg and
beſeech ye, moſt Learned Auditors, to pardon my Juſt Tears,
while I am performing the laſt unpleaſing duties to the <hi>Manes</hi>
of an incomparable Queen.</p>
                  <p>Whoever will give his mind to peruſe the Annals of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
People, ſhall find therein the Famous Actions, Renowned
Enterpriſes, Laurels, Palms, together with other Grandeurs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt,
and publickly now commemorated. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Hiſtorian aſſembl'd all his cares and cogitations, that
he might conſecrate thoſe Eternal Monuments of the mind,
which no Antiquity could ever deface, and leave behind him
not an Effigies of <hi>Breathing Braſs,</hi> but of <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſet forth and
poliſh'd by the moſt ſublime Wirs. We find it alſo Recorded,
that this <hi>Propagation of Honour,</hi> from whence Antiquity would
have ſucceeding Ages take Example, was tranſmitted to the
Female Sex, in the ſix hundred ſixty third year from the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62815:28"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither has Nature ſo ſtreightned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
her Praiſes, as out of envy to malign the Women, and
ſhower her Favours on the Men. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> made a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Oration upon his Aunt <hi>Julia</hi> in the Publick Hall of
Juſtice, wherein by the Mothers ſide he derives her deſcent
from a long Series of Kings, and by the Father's ſide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
her Lineage from the Immortal Gods. Following
the Footſteps of this moſt Elegant of Orators, for that Title
<hi>Tully</hi> gives him, though with unequal Paces, I thought I
could not take a better Method, then to weave my Oration
upon the ſame Loom, beginning from the Nativity of the
moſt bleſſed Queen, with a purpoſe afterwards to expatiate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Portico full of Images. Happy Age that produc'd ſuch
a Princeſs,—Happy the Parents of ſuch Daughter, the
moſt abſolute Examplar of all Vertues, even by the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thoſe that burſt with Envy. Let the Sons of <hi>Romulus</hi>
pleaſe themſelves with thoſe, who by an intermixture of
Progeny have wreſted their Country from the <hi>Galls,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to themſelves a ſingular Commendation from that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
but all theſe things ſignifie nothing to our <hi>MARIE,</hi>
who alone was endued with ſo many ornaments of Pious
Manners, ſo many, and ſo illuſtrious Enſigns of true Glory, as
have eclips'd the fame of all the moſt Celebrated Matrons in
the World. 'Tis enough then that our Immortal Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
deriv'd her deſcent from a long Race of Royal Blood,
and that her Anceſtors ſate enthron'd for Many Ages; 'twould
be a mean Begging of the Queſtion to repeat her Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>She was born in the Month of <hi>May, 1662.</hi> She grew up
in the Boſom of her Parents, educated in a Court flowing
with thoſe Pleaſures that uſually charm the Fancies of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that have little reſtaint upon 'em, and ſeduce 'em from
their innate Goodneſs. But ſhe, poſtponing all thoſe gay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
with which render Age, fit for any Impreſſion, is fed,
deteſted all thoſe Syreus of Voluptuouſneſs, whoſe Charms
inticed to Sloth and Luxury, the two Deſtructions and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks
both of Body and Soul. Intent upon the painful Arts
that firſt <hi>Minerva</hi> taught, ſhe made it her only Buſineſs to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<hi>Penelape</hi> with her Needle, dedicating her time wholly to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62815:28"/>
Embroidery and the Curioſities of Needlework, which are
ſtill to be ſeen, the Monuments of her Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> thus formerly ſold to <hi>Siſigambes,</hi> the Mother of
<hi>Darius,</hi> a Garment, the Elaborate Work and Gift of his own
Siſters. The Coverlets and Carpets of the deceaſed Princeſs,
wrought with <hi>Babylonian</hi> Art, are daily to be beheld with
Wonder. All this while, how zealous ſhe was for the true
Worſhip of the True God, apparent to the Eyes of all Men,
plainly demonſtrated. For when her Uncle <hi>Charles</hi> II:
(whoſe care for his Brother's Daughter is not to be paſt over
in Silence) appointed her a Tutor to lay the firſt Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in her of the moſt corrected and ſincere Religion, they
were ſo deeply fixed in her Breaſt, that afterwards no Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
no threatned dangers, no promiſes of Golden Mountains,
no Temptations of Pleaſure could undermine her. In this
ſame Station of Laudable Exerciſes, and Eximious Piety for
ſixteen Years together, She was at length lookt upon by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
at that time Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the moſt prudent and
valiant Commander and Admiral of the <hi>Belgian</hi> Army, and
Statholder of the Commonwealth, as the only Perſon worthy
for him to demand in Marriage, and He adjudged the only
Perſon fit to be joined with Her in Conjugal Affection. For if
Vettue becomes more acceptable in an amiable Shrine, there
were in <hi>Mary</hi> thoſe Accompliſhments of Beauty, that might
well enforce and inflame Prince <hi>William</hi>'s Ardour. The Rays
of Lively Youth, a cheerful Decorum in her Eyes, the Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of her diſhrevel'd Treſſes, and beſides the Ornamental
Artifices of her Dreſſers, her Lovely Stature recommended
the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> to her Lover. Content with a ſlight, but
decent Dreſs, ſhe abhorr'd that wanton diligence which they
only inſtance of, who carry their Beauty in their Cabinets,
and have nothing but Jemms and Jewels to ſet 'em off; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
Maiden Accoutrement by the true Eſtimate of Chaſtity,
Modeſty, Conſtancy and Fidelity, and believing ſhe ſtood in
need of no other Ceruſſes to render her acceptable, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
therefore was ſign'd, and I may ſay moſt happily for us,
upon the 18th day of <hi>December, 1677.</hi> A day ſo much the more
to be celebrated, for that upon the ſame day Prince <hi>William</hi>
enter'd into the twenty ſeventh year of his Age. This Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62815:29"/>
League confirm'd in her Native Country; this near relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Blood, and the Nuptial Bed, this Unity of ſacred Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
renew'd our hopes of eſtabliſhing for the future the Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Friendſhip with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> our Neighbours, before
ſo often violated and broken, nor did they fail your Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation;
'tis incredible how the Face of Affairs immediately
alter'd. For the next Year the <hi>French</hi> King ſurrounded with
the Strength of a moſt Flouriſhing Kingdom, pretended to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs
the Laws of Peace, and earneſtly of his own accord ſued
for an Accommodation. Others who thought it their wiſeſt
way, there to bend their Forces where Fortune turn'd the
Scales, ſuſpecting and envying this ſame riveted Bond of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Affection, refolv'd to provide for their own ſafety, and
to unite their dubious Intereſts with Ours.</p>
                  <p>When this ſame moſt ſerene couple, then which there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could be yet imagin'd a Royal Pair ſo cloſely knit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingal
Affection, as the moſt ſorrowful King, in his Letters to
the moſt Illuſtrious States, wherein he ſignifies the unexpected
and never too much deplor'd Deceaſe of his Incomparable
Queen, apparently diſcovers, had enjoy'd all the variety of
delight, and Princely Paſtimes that <hi>London</hi> could afford, in
Company with their Father, their Uncle, and the Princes
of <hi>Britain,</hi> he began to think of returning back to our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
and re-adorning with his own, and preſence of his
Royal Conſort, his Principal Abode and Glory of our State
the <hi>Hague.</hi> With what a profuſeneſs of Love and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with what exquiſite Teſtimonies of Veneratiou and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the two Princes were receiv'd and welcom'd home, upon
their arrival aſhoar, would be needleſs for Me, moſt Learned
Auditors, to ſet forth in multitude of Expreſſions, ſince all
who are now alive, either beheld it with their Eyes, or
heard it by unfeign'd Relation. And it would take up too
much time to collect together the continu'd Series of thoſe
Things which the Princeſs <hi>Marie,</hi> indefatigable in doing
good, and ſought to by her native Countrymen, to gratifie
their Petitions perform'd in order to the compoſing the Affair
of <hi>Britain,</hi> the Reſtoration of Tottering Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
Liberty. It behoves us therefore to trace the chiefeſt
Footſteps of the Vertues of our Princeſs, but not to ſpeak ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62815:29"/>
much as may deſervedly be ſpoken of 'em, but ſuch Things
only as without a hainous offence cannot be omitted by me,
nor can ſuit with any other but the Queen.</p>
                  <p>As to her Piety, which the moſt Excellent of Orators
rightly calls the Foundation of all Vertues, ſhe had ſuch a
true, and real Veneration for it, that ſhe believ'd there was
no degree of Majeſty whatever, no Power of Princes which
were not oblig'd to ſubmit their Puiſſance to it. She was fully
confirm'd from her Infancy, that Piety neglected by Princes
and Governours of States was an ill Omen of apparent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
and that they themſelves were convinc'd of
the neceſſity of it, who, tho' they liv'd altogether in Contempt
of it, nevertherleſs (the worſt ſort of Mimicry) feign'd to
have a Love for it, and ſo would ſeem to be Pious, not
really to be ſo. But if the Sun infects with Blackneſs thoſe
who are continually ſcalded with his Beams; if a Head that
is ſain and ſound, imparts Motion, Strength, and Vigour
to the Members. In like manner Domeſtic Servants and
Subjects derive their Dye and Colour from the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of the Princeſs, and their Sanctity and Integrity from
the Prince, who is the Head of the Commonweal. Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
has recorded, that <hi>Midas</hi> being initiated into ſacred Rights
by <hi>Orpheus,</hi> fill'd all <hi>Phrygia</hi> with Religion, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Country much more durably ſafe, then the
ſtrength of her Arms. Therefore the moſt Serene Princeſs
conſecrated certain fix'd Hours to Divine Worſhip, which
ſhe either ſpent in Prayer, or elſe in reading Books of good
and ſolid Divinity. Sublime Example! fit to be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Encomiums, Eulogies, Orations, Writings and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
to all Poſterity, and to be erected to the Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of Slothful and Irreligious Matrons! When thoſe more
ſolemn Duties of Religion were over, ſhe never gave her
Mind to the frivolous ſtories of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and impertinent
Fictions of <hi>Amad.</hi> but attentively ſtudied the Volumes of
thoſe Authors by which ſhe might improve her Knowledge
and her Prudence. And leſt, moſt learned Auditors, any
one ſhould think this ſhort Oration compos'd at the obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious
Inſtigations of ſpecious and pleaſingly deluſive Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
I ſhall relate not what I gathered from the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62815:30"/>
of Fame, but from the Lips of a moſt worthy Perſon,
and my Friend, who being admitted in the Morning to kiſs
her Hands, found before her <hi>Cambden</hi>'s Annals of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
and Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Reformation.
But Piety is never to be accounted ſolidly accompliſh'd unleſs
accompanied with Liberality; otherwiſe it would be Piety
only in words, and not in deeds, as ſhe her ſelf upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of her Expiring Minutes diſcours'd of a Godly and
Vertuous Life. You People of <hi>France,</hi> who abandoning your
Native Soyl, becauſe you would not ſuffer Violence upon
your Conſciences, nor liſten to the adulterate Charms of Bards,
and Druids. You People of <hi>France,</hi> I ſay, depriv'd of all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Life, fled to this moſt Clement Princeſs, as to the
Altar of ſome Sanctuary, or ſome preſent Female Deity.
What time the Princeſs ſtruck with Compaſſion, pleaded your
unfortunate Cauſe before the Fathers of the Country, ſhe
ſweetly ſollicited the wealthy Treaſures of many to pity your
Condition: Sollicited do I ſay! Nay more, ſhe ſent 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
reliev'd and ſuccour'd with her own Royal Revenues.
That others alſo were no leſs Sharers in her Princely Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
the Money which ſhe order'd to be ſolded and ſeal'd
up in Papers, and diſtributed without Vainglory, and with
an unwearied Charity to the Indigent, ſufficiently manifeſted.
Believing it more Generous, and more Praiſeworthy by this
means to oblige her Debtors, which were many, ſee that for two
or three Years together ſhe order'd to be expended; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
conſiderable Sums of Money to thoſe, who in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Holland</hi> were not able to provide againſt the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Seaſon, and the injuries of the Weather. That
ſhe was affable and courteous, by which ſhe acquir'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and Love of all Perſons, is undeniably acknowledg'd
on every Hand. For what was more uſually obſerv'd in
this Princeſs? She never ſtay'd for the moſt convenient
times of Addreſs, and the fitteſt times to be ſpoken with, but
meeting the Deſires of thoſe that made their Suits and Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to her, receiv'd 'em with a Serene Countenance; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Veneration that was due to her, believing that
Affability and Gravity might reſide together in one Manſion,
ſhe re-ſaluted thoſe that bow'd to her; offer'd what not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62815:30"/>
rightly deeming, that <hi>no Perſon was to return diſſatisfied
and Penſive from the Preſence of a Prince;</hi> which was the ſaying
of that Emperor who was call'd the <hi>Love and Delight of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
Now then if we but duly conſider thoſe Vertues, moſt
Learned Auditors, what Man ſo Iron-Tongu'd, and Leaden-hearted,
who can blame all ſorts of Perſons, whether of high
or low degree, for being perplexed and troubled at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of a Princeſs ſo Pious, ſo munificent? But unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Neceſſity demanded, and commandingly requir'd, that
ſhe muſt begin and follow her beloved Husband, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
of Generals, then buſily engag'd to deliver the Necks
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from being trampled on by Superſtition, and
illegal Slavery. But when the moſt Serene Princeſs call'd
to mind the remembrance of her Subjects, by whom ſhe was
moſt entirely and dearly reverenc'd, and eſteem'd; when ſhe
thought of that Palace of <hi>Loo,</hi> where ſhe oft went to alleviate
and divert the Cares of her Mind, from having a full Proſpect
of the Woods, and ſpacious Fields of <hi>Velau,</hi> ſhe beheld her
Husband in purſuit of the wild Beaſts, with a full Cry;
when ſhe revolv'd in her Mind how terrible a thing it was
for a Kingdom to be without a Head and Chieftain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with her Lot, and ſore againſt her Will, ſhe was
torn away by Force from her Belgian Delights. The
publick Cauſe was in Diſpute, and that overcame her
Charity toward her Subjects, her Country Pleaſures, her
Moderation, her equity of Mind, nay, even the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which ſhe had for her Father himſelf, whom ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
went about to impugn, nor ever deſir'd his being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
but enforc'd only to Conſent that a Parliament
might be duly Summon'd, and that what had been alter'd,
ſhaken, or broken, might be reſtor'd to their former State,
that is to ſay, according the Laws and moſt ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the Kingdom, which he had ſworn to obſerve,
and that above all things care might be taken that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Liberty might receive no harm. Reluctant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and as it were by Conſtraint (for according to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic
Paradox, a Wiſe Man does nothing unwillingly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for which he is ſorry, nothing by Compulſion) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from us upon the twelfth of <hi>March,</hi> in the Year
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62815:31"/>
1689, with a fair Wind ſhe arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> which was
now without a Governour, and where the Army was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Leader. But leſt any External Force, while the Minds
of the People were variouſly diſtracted and provok'd; as Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
ſpread abroad, the Nobility and Gentry of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
reſolv'd to reſign the Care of the Kingdom, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Government to the two Princes; and upon
the ſeventh of the Kalender of <hi>March,</hi> in the year before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
the ſame day, as ſome aver, that put an end to
the Reign of <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud, declar'd <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>
King and Queen of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and upon
the third of the Ides of <hi>April,</hi> what day they obtain'd the
Royal Crown and Scepter, King and Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo.
From that time forward they held the two Kingdoms with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Auſpices, and concording Minds, yet ſo that by reaſon
of the Wars, which the <hi>French</hi> King, graſping in his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
hopes the Dominion of all <hi>Europe,</hi> have every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd,
was forc'd to croſs the Seas, and remain abroad for
ſome time. Therefore during the abſence of the King, the
Empire of the Kingdom, ſo great was her Genius, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to her Care, which ſhe manag'd with ſo much prudence
and fortitude, that ſhe repell'd from the Coaſts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
an Inſulting Enemy, menacing to Land; and ſuppreſs'd
and extinguiſh'd Conſpiracies enter'd into by a new ſort of
<hi>Catilines.</hi> She muſter'd the Land Armies, and view'd the
Fleets, and took care that nothing ſhould be wanting in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that might be uſeful either to ſtop or invade the Enemy,
or relieve, and aſſiſt her own. For this Tranquility
of the Times, for this ſame ſingular Providence, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
did ſhe not more truly then any Princeſs before her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Appellations of <hi>Augnſt,</hi> of <hi>Parent of her Country,</hi>
of <hi>Beſt Mother,</hi> and <hi>Mother of the Martial Camps?</hi> This every
year ſhe labour'd to ſee accompliſh'd, to the end the King
might recroſs the Seas in his Military Ornaments, the Key of
the Kingdom being deliver'd to the Queen, till towards the
end of laſt Autumn; after an Expedition ended upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>France,</hi> he haſten'd to the Embraces of his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
and to provide for thoſe things which were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
in Parliament for the raiſing of Money towards the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62815:31"/>
ſupplies of the Armies and Fleets. The King took Shipping,
put to Sea, and with a proſperous Wind arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi>
where he had no ſooner ſet his Foot aſhoar, but the loud ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of the People were heard in all quarters of the
Britiſh Dominions, <hi>Long flouriſh Great</hi> Britain, <hi>long live our
Country, long live King</hi> William. And not long after her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
meeting the King, all along upon the Road theſe lucky
Omens, and tranſcending Applauſes fill'd the Sky. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder
the Protection of our King and Queen we live; under their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
we Navigate and Trade; under their Protection we enjay our
Fortunes and our Liberties.</hi> Then moſt Auguſt Monarch, ſhould
any one from among thoſe vaſt congratulating, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Multitudes have ſhew'd himſelf, and preſag'd that thoſe
Rejoycings were but the Fore-runners of Grief, and would
be ſoon defil'd by ſome ſignal Calamity impending on the
Royal Family, would he not have been deſervedly lookt upon
as ſome impertinent Enthuſiaſtick? So ignorant are human
Minds of future Chance and Fate. Such Sacrifices and Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as theſe the Omnipotent has preſcrib'd to vaunting
Mortals, and ordain'd it as a Law, that the greateſt Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
ſhould rule their Affairs, the Proſperity of which no
Man could ever ſo aſſuredly promiſe himſelf, as to depend
upon a Fortunate Courſe of his Life without ſome intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Adverſity. Thus it fell out, that when the toilſome
Labours of the Camp had recall'd the King to Reſt, and
Paſtime, a mournful Calamity ſhook and oppreſs'd his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Soul, ſtill wakeful over the ſafety of his Kingdoms,
where all ſucceeded according to his Mind, and no leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilent
for the Common Good of the <hi>Belgians,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in their Minds a lucky Omen of ſucceeſs from the
more early then uſual, tho' ardently wiſh'd for return of their
renown'd General. For upon the third of <hi>January 1694-95.</hi> The
Queen was ſeiz'd with a ſlight ſhivering, but which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nothing of danger to her Life, the Phyſicians giving hope
of Relief and Cure, believing this Royal Fortreſs might be
defended by their Hands. But upon the ſixth of <hi>January</hi> the
Fever gathering Strength, and reinforcing its Virulency,
and the ſmall-Pox, a Contagion generally incident to Youth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
but not kindly coming forth, tho' all help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62815:32"/>
were apply'd that human Experience has invented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the violence of that diſtemper, it was in vain at length
for all the Art of Phyſick to contend; for the Diſeaſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſeiz'd upon the Queen with ſuch a pernicious force
as vanquiſh'd all the aid of Man. All the while the King
refus'd to ſtir from the Languiſhing Queen's Bedſide, aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to ſerve her, and careleſs of the Infection that many
times accompanies that Malady; and being often requeſted
to ſpare his Royal Perſon, and not to inflict another Wound
upon ſuffering <hi>Europe,</hi> made Anſwer, That when he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
the Queen, he Convenanted to be the Companion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of her Proſperity, but of whatever Fortune befel her, and
that he would, with the hazard of his Life receive from her
Lips her laſt expiring Gaſps.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Felices ter, &amp; amplius</l>
                     <l>Quos Irrupta tenet Copula, nec Malis</l>
                     <l>Divulſus querimoniis</l>
                     <l>Suprema citius ſolvet Amor Dic.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>All hope of Recovery now was fled away, and the moſt
Reverend Father in God, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being
admitted into the Room in order to perform the laſt Duties
of his Function, told her Majeſty, that the fatal hour was at
hand, that the Forces of her Body being weaken'd, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
Death was making his Approaches, and therefore ſhe
had nothing more to do, but to ſubmit herſelf to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Almighty. Such a harſh and diſconſolate Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
would have ſtruck another Perſon, tho' long exercis'd
and harden'd in Stoical Indolency, with Horror and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
But what ſaid the Queen to this? Full of Faith and
Conſtancy, ſhe receiv'd the tidings with a chearful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
Countenance, ſaying withal, That ſhe did no way
ſeek to ſhun the the ſtroke of Death, but was ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for the Dark Manſion of the Grave, for that ſhe had
always ſo led her Life, that whenever Death gave her his
laſt Summons, ſhe ſhould be a gainer by it. Having thns ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
without the leaſt emotion of Mind, ſhe receiv'd the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Pledges of Divine Peace, and ineffable Conſolation to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62815:32"/>
the Thirſt and Hunger of her Soul, deliver'd her by the
Moſt Reverend Father, at the ſame time with moſt ardent
Wiſhes, and pious Ejaculations, calling upon her Redeemer
nail'd to the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>This laſt and moſt mournful Act remain'd, and then the
King oppreſs'd, and bowing under the Burden of his own
Sorrows, e're death had quite benumm'd her trembling Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the warm Vapour of Breath lay panting in her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Breaſt, bid her Eternally farewell. Which laſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
and evident ſigns of the moſt tender motions of the
Soul were perform'd with that Sincerity of a Cordial Paſſion, that
you may readily, moſt Learned Auditors, conjecture the Anguiſh
of ſuch a doleful Parting, though my Oration, my bow being
enfeebled with Sadneſs, cannot reach the perfect Deſcription. At
length—my words ſtick faſt upon my Tongue—
At length—I ſay, upon the ſeventh day of the Ides of
<hi>January,</hi> about twelve a Clock at Noon, the Bleſſed Queen
reſign'd her pure Soul to God with a moſt placid <hi>Exit,</hi> not
having fully accompliſh'd the thirty third year of her Age,
and conſequently in the flower of her Years: This was the
End of a Queen, in whom not only Piety, Benignity, and
Humanity, but all Vertues ſeem to be ecclips'd. Oh cruel
Fate! Oh untimely Death! Timely I ſhould have ſaid, my
Accompt fail'd me. For if we meaſure the Courſe of the
Queen's Life, circumſcrib'd by Years, at firſt ſight it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be very much ſtreightned, and very ſhort. But if
we look farther, we ſhall find it to be a long, and immenſe
Race of Glory. One day of a Wiſe Man, ſays <hi>Poſſidonius,</hi>
is more extenſive then the whole Age of an ignorant Perſon.
That ſame <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe Atchievements acquir'd him
the name of <hi>Great; Germanicus Caeſar,</hi> endu'd with as many
Graces of Body and Mind as I remember any Man to have
been, both dy'd at the ſame Age, and if we may preſume
to compare ſmall with great things, he whoſe Garment and
Thigh has theſe Words inſcrib'd upon 'em, <hi>Rex Regum,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
his days no farther: In this accompt we find it often
fall out quite contrary to the Opinion of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by way of Diſpute, that they who make it their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
during the whole Courſe of their Lives, to be benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62815:33"/>
to Mankind, and to ſeek renown by Laudable Atcheiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and profitable Sciences, ought to live longer then
they who waſte their leiſure in ſloth and Idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>The King, when the firſt word oſ her final departure,
ſwoon'd more than once away; and that ſome undaunted
Hero, Fearleſs of all Dangers, who never was wont to fly
before a tenfold Number of Enemies, who never gave way
to the enſnaring Ambuſeadoes and Thefts of War, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſtood immoveable in the middle of Showers of Bombs,
Granadoes, and Bullets, ſunk under the weight of one ſingle
Sorrow. But he is eaſily to be pardoned. For he wants the
Queen, the ſweet half of his Soul, whom he was wont to
lay in his Boſom, whom he lov'd more tenderly than his Eyes,
whom he was wont to make the partaker of his Cares,
and whom he always made the Companion of his Joys. The
Palace of <hi>Whitehall</hi> reſounded with the Sobs and Sighs of thoſe
wail'd her Deceaſe, but the Publick Lamentation not to be
confin'd within thoſe narrow Walls, orewhelm'd the whole
City of <hi>London,</hi> and ſtruck with Conſternation the Hearts of all
Men, Peers, and Common People, young and old, Matrons and
Virgins, ſo deeply did the ſence of the Misfortune penetrate all
Ages. The unſpeakable cruelty of Death was bemoan'd, the
ſpacious Age of Time upbraided and accuſed, the General Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
bewail'd, and a univerſal diſguiſe of Sorrow, disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Countenances of both Sexes.</p>
                  <p>This fatal News from <hi>England</hi> reach'd our Coaſts; to which
at firſt, becauſe we always ſlowly believe thoſe Rumours which
are unwelcome to us, we gave but little credit. Preſently all
People were in a hurry, one runs one way, another another,
and what is this ſad News they cry, whence comes it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
it? But being at length aſſur'd by frequent Confirmations,
preſently all Men of Worth and Prudence, who made a juſt
Eſtimate of the loſs which the Publick ſuſtain'd by the Death
of the Queen, were ſeiz'd with more than ordinary Grief,
which fail'd not to diffuſe it ſelf into univerſal Mourning and
Lamentation. And now you People of <hi>England,</hi> who retain the
acknowledgment of thoſe Immortal Benefits, which the Queen
conferr'd upon ye, when ſhe ſuccour'd your Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
You <hi>Belgians,</hi> to whom the Queen, for her Maternal
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62815:33"/>
Indulgence was dearer then your Lives I make my appeal
to ye in the memorable Words of <hi>Metellius,</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
who when the News was brought him of the Death of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio
Aemilianus,</hi> thus beſpake his Sons: <hi>Go, Children, Solemnize
the Obſequies; you will never behold the Funeral of a braver Citizen,</hi>
So I ſay to you—<hi>Go Engliſh Men, go</hi> Belgians, <hi>ſolemnize her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies.—You will never behold the Funeral of a greater Queen.</hi>
But wherefore do I by an unpleaſing Commemoration go about
to impoſe Affliction and the performances of Reſpectful ſorrow
upon thoſe that are forward enough of themſelves. Let us
rather return Thanks to God, that he permitted the Reſidence
of ſo great a Queen among us, 'till he call'd her to himſelf;
which was the ſaying, and the Conſolation of thoſe who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Funeral of <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> that moſt worthy Emperor,
without any Tears or Lamentations. Let us raiſe our Minds
above Neceſſity, and our Thoughts above Fate. Were her
Manes permitted to return back to us, the Queen would tell
us ſhe was well, and that we did but envy her in grieving:
For that indeed, that is to be accounted the affection of true
Love, which outwardly ſhews it ſelf, and which forgetful of
it ſelf is tranſported to what it loves. But as they ſay the Effigies
of <hi>Phidias</hi> can never be defac'd from the Shield of <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſo we
cannot better deſerve of <hi>Marie,</hi> the moſt renown'd Queen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Memory of Ages, then by ſtoring up her Vertues in the
moſt ſecret Receſſes of our hearts on purpoſe for imitation. We
know that the Roman Senate was wont by a decree to propoſe
for a Pattern to all thoſe that were ſent abroad to command
in the Provinces, one only <hi>Quintus Mucius Scaevola,</hi> once their
high Prieſt, as if they had diſplay'd in that one Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was Egregious and Illuſtrious, and conſequently fit for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation:
So now they who at preſent ſit, or ſhall hereafter
ſit at the Helm of Government, have one only Queen, far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
not only her Sex, but <hi>Mucius</hi> himſelf, to be by them
recommended for univerſal Imitation to all thoſe who would
not want any of thoſe accompliſh'd Perfections, by which we
aſcend the Steps to Heaven. I congratulate thee, O Queen,
for that Felicity of Living ſo long, as it was this thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
while it was thy daily acknowledgment, that thou
hadſt learnt to dye. Hail, and farewell moſt beautiful and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62815:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bleſſed Royal Soul. The King, and all of us muſt follow thee
in that Order which Nature has appointed. Hail moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Soul, all hail, and Eternally farewell.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly to thee, moſt Potent Monarch, environ'd with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
and Affliction, and welcom'd home with ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Calamity, I addreſs my ſelf. Forbear great Sir, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to bath your Royal Cheeks continually in ſtreams of
Tears, but ſet juſt limits to your Sorrows, Sorrows that will
nothing avail.—I know, ſaid the Wiſe <hi>Athenian,</hi> and
for that reaſon grieve the more, that all my Mourning and
Lamentation does me no good. I confeſs indeed, Invincible
Prince, I muſt acknowledge 'tis a great matter, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Embraces, the Company and Converſe of
ſuch a Queen, the depoſitory of the greateſt part of your
Cares, ſo ſtudious, and diligent in her Obedience and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.
But your tranſcending Prudence doubtleſs conſiders
that the Supream Arbiter of all things is not bound to fulfill
all our Wiſhes and deſires. 'Tis a trite Proverb, The young
Man whom God loves ſoon dies. The great Reward of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well is fix'd beyond all danger of thoſe Vexations and
Calamities with which the Life of Mortal Men contends.
Then with your wonted Reſolution ſuſtain a Loſs that could
not be avoided; revive your Spirits, and renew your Strength,
bow'd down with Sorrow, and like a ſecond <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> your days
of Mourning being over, take care of your Perſon, take care
of the Welfare of all <hi>Europe:</hi> and may the Almighty, who
has been your Protection all along, wipe away all your
tears of Grief, proſper you Counſels and Affairs, and add to
your own the Years which he has taken from your Queen.</p>

UPON THE
Death of the QUEEN.</head>
                  <p>THIS Day is Buried the Greateſt Queen of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
Are our Affairs reduc'd to this, that what was
only wanting to compleat our Miſeries, the bitter
Death of Auguſt <hi>MARY,</hi> as an Accumulation of
our Sadneſs, muſt ſall out to render yet more Grievous the
Misfortune of theſe Mournful Times! the Death of Auguſt
<hi>MARY,</hi> that has afflicted <hi>England</hi> with an Unſpeakable, loſs
that hardly admits of Conſolation, has ſtruck <hi>Holland</hi> with
Aſtoniſhment, and fill'd all the Chriſtian World with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
and Conſternation. Already brighter Suns began to
ſhine, and the Minds of all Men were erected to hope a more
proſperous Fortune, and more eaſie times; when of a ſudden
an unexpected Tempeſt, like Thunder ratling with loud
Noiſe and Terror from a ſerene Sky, ſtrikes and throws down
all before it, and changes all our promiſing Hopes into Fear
and penſive Solicitude. Oh, how ſudden and how ſwift is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62815:36"/>
the Viciſſitude of Humane Affairs! Therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
not only the Dreſſes, but the Countenances of all men
chang'd with ſorrow, and the deeper ſence of ſo great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
which having pierc'd the very Marrow, is not to
be aſſwag'd, nor alleviated by any applications of comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Words. For together with this moſt pious Queen, even
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> themſelves are this day carry'd forth to
be entomb'd. Therefore we behold the Fathers of our
Country in Sable, Pale, and with their Eyes fixed upon the
Ground, and delug'd with tears, and by their mournful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
teſtifying the Extremity of that ſorrow which afflicts
their Breaſts. Nor is it a ſmaller Demonſtration of embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
Grief, which all Degrees, and every Age, and every
Sex in all places openly diſcover by their ſobbings, ſighs and
lamentable Wailings. Nor does the Ignorance of Infancy,
nor the forgetful Inſenſibility of decrepit Years, nor the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of Women ſitting at home, exempt 'em from the
ſadneſs that oppreſſes Us. Not only Men, but the Country
Cottages, the Coverings of our Cities, our Market-places,
Courts of Judicature, our Tribunals, our Schools and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,
o're-ſpread with Deformity, mute, and almoſt in
Ruines, ſeem to grieve, as being afraid of being levell'd with
the Earth, now their Supportreſs is gone. The very Walls
of this Magnificent Church, the Portice's and Chappels hung
with Mourning, and deſpoyl'd of their Ornaments, fill our
Eyes and Minds with all the Marks of Incredible Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Laſtly, there is no place, wherein there is not ſome
Monument or other fixed of Publick and Inconſolable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.
When the Death of <hi>Druſus Germanicus,</hi> who by
his ſingular Vertue and Benevolence toward all Men, had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a wonderful manner won the Good Will not only of his
Fellow Citizens, but of all forreign Princes and People, was
reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> inflam'd with a certain Rage
of Mourning and Sorrow, defac'd their Temples, pull'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62815:36"/>
down the Altars of their Gods, threw their Houſhold Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
into the Streets; Fathers of Families expoſed the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Births of their Wives: fooliſhly they, and wickedly,
who went about to bring their Gods into Hatred, by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
their Worſhip, with whom they were angry, for the
loſs of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> raviſh'd from 'em. But we are angry
with our ſelves, and our ſins, by which God being deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provokd, has taken from us the beſt of Queens within
the memory of Hiſtory, at an unlucky time, and in the
flower of her Age. And yet we no leſs impartially Grieve,
than thoſe <hi>Antient Romans,</hi> tho we are far remote from their
impious Piety. For this incurable Wound, which is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, ſo tears and rends the minds of all Men, that the
Torments of infinite Grief overcome all Conſolation, and all
Phyſick whatever is too weak for the terrible Diſtemper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which we groan. But as the Death of ſo great a Queen
is an accident lamented by all Good, ſo by none more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd,
if we except the King himſelf, than by the moſt
Illuſtrious Fathers of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> How many Signs and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of this moſt Juſt Grief for our incredible Loſs are
Extant every where! Nevertheleſs they were deſirous that
the Force and Exuberancy of it ſhould be alſo from my
Lips made known as well to others Living, as to ſucceeding
Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>How well could I now wiſh that I had never underſtood
Letters! And this I ſpeak with more ſincerity, than that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
who being to ſubſcribe the Warrant for the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Capital Offender, cried out in like manner, Oh, that
I had never known to Write! For my mind abhors and
Flies the Performance of this Diſmal function, both becauſe
of the weight of that ſorrow which has ſo broken and
weak'nd all the parts of my mind, that they can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
themſelves; as alſo, for that tho I were in perfect
Vigour, neither ſtruck nor afflicted with any Trouble, yet I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62815:37"/>
am conſcious to my ſelf of my own Inability, and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my ſelf inferior to the Task impoſed upon me,
of ſetting forth the high Praiſes and Merits of this Divine
Queen. Yet there is two things which not a little confirm me,
and inſpire ſomething of a Soul in me, the praiſe that attends
Obedience, which was all along a moſt ſacred and certain
convincement, that no man, tho moſt plentifully furniſhed
with all the Endowments of Wit and Learning, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Mortals in ſpeaking Eloquently and Politely, can be
able, I will not ſay in words, but in thoughts, to reach the
true Encomiums of <hi>Auguſt Mary,</hi> who alone ſhin'd forth in
all ſorts of Vertue, not only above the Genius of her Sex,
and the Age ſhe liv'd in, but above the Examples of all the
moſt praiſe-worthy Heroeſſes in all times; that ſhe may be
deſervedly proclaim'd to be the <hi>Only Queen,</hi> or rather more
truly the <hi>Queen of Queens.</hi> Nor can there a greater Praiſe
belong to any man, than that it is not in the Power of any
man to praiſe him ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore ſpeak of <hi>MARY ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ART,</hi> becauſe
I am engaged to ſpeak, not according to the Dignity of
the Subject, the excellency of which no mortal can attain
to, but according to the Strength of Capacity and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.
Nor do I doubt but you, moſt noble and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Auditors here preſent, out of your Incomparable Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Queen, will give a favourable attention to what
I ſhall ſay, tho it may not anſwer the Merits of the Queen,
nor your Exyectation. While I obey the Will of thoſe, from
whom my will ought never to diſagree; I am in hopes that
you will alſo be ſatisfied with my moſt earneſt Zeal to ſatisfy
your Commands, tho my ſtrength may not equal the Decree
of my mind.</p>
                  <p>I am unwilling, Noble Auditors, at the beginning, to be
tedious in thoſe things, upon which the Orations of thoſe
Men that pay the laſt Duties to the <hi>Manes</hi> of great Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
are wont to enlarge. I ſhall ſay nothing of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62815:37"/>
the moſt Fortunate of all the Iſlands upon which the
Sun ſhines, the Parent of Emperors, the Foſter-Mother of
ſo many Potent Kings, and famous for their Noble Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in all Climates of the Earth; the Nurſe of ſo many
Couragious Leaders; the Domicel of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and all laudable Arts, the Seat of Liberty, wherein
<hi>MARY</hi> firſt drew her Vital Breath. Let them admire and
boaſt the Felicity of their Country, to whom their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is an Ornament, not they who adorn their Country.
<hi>MARY,</hi> in whatever Land ſhe had been born, had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
worthy of that high Degree, to which the State of
her Birth had exalted her, as being form'd by the Hands of
more Benign Nature to Royal Dignity. She had Shon
with her own Beams even in Darkneſs it ſelf; ſuch a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to Vertue appear'd in her from her tender Years. The
Glory of an Illuſtrious Family, won by the Vertue of the
Founders, is admir'd among all People. For as <hi>Gems</hi> more
ſplendidly glitter when ſet in Gold, ſo Vertue ſhines forth
more dazlingly in true Nobility. However, they who are
puft up with Titles, and grow big with the Images of
their <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> ſupported by no Vertue of their own, are
not vvorthy of thoſe Ornaments. They fall from their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
who fully the Dignity of it with Pride, Sloath and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vices. <hi>MARY</hi> was ſufficiently Ennobl'd by her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent:
But ſo great and ſo incredible vvas the multitude of
the admirable Vertues of this Princeſs, that ſhe rather Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
her Anceſtors, than vvas illuſtrated by them; and
contributed more Ornaments to the Enlargement of their
Glory, than ſhe receiv'd from their Antiquity. What men
have admir'd as the principal Ornaments of an Illuſtrious
Family in particular Perſons, all thoſe crowded together, ſo
far as her Sex was capable, in <hi>MARY,</hi> the moſt accompliſh'd
vvith all Endowments and Perfections of Body and Mind,
vvhich God, the giver of all good things, had largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62815:38"/>
upon her. But vvhy do I inſiſt upon thoſe things vvhich
are common to her, with her Anceſtors, when ſhe abounds
with ſo many particular Graces and Ornaments peculiarly
her own? Among which, that her Piety to God, and her
Love of Religion, held the chiefeſt place, there's none of
you that ever doubted.</p>
                  <p>What the Sun is in Heaven among the Stars, that Piety is
among the Vertues. All Light is derived from the Sun.
From Piety alſo and Religion, as from the only and moſt
Limpid Fountain, flow the reſt of the Vertues, which ſhe
foſter'd in her Boſom and her Embraces. What Prudence,
what Fortitude, what Fidelity, what Moderation, what
Benignity can be found in any other perſon, where there is
not care taken to ſuppreſs the Turbulent Motions of the
Mind, to reſtrain the Impetuoſities of Deſire, and be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their Dignity and Duty? But this is the Work of
Religion only. Now with what a Love of Religion the
Auguſt <hi>MARY</hi> was inflam'd, with what a fervency of
Mind ſhe was incens'd, to the Improvement of her Piety,
I ſhould not adventure to commemorate, were it not a
thing well known to all people, not only to ſuch as attended
about her Perſon, but to the Embaſſadors of forreign Princes
and Commonwealths, who frequented the Queens Court.
They will hardly gain credit, perhaps, among thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Manners and Cuſtoms of Courts, and of thoſe
that are bred up in 'em; or among ſuch who are perſwaded
that Religion, Piety, and Modeſty, are only Names made
uſe of to impoſe upon the People, or at leaſt the Properties of
private perſons.</p>
                  <p>They who would be accounted Pious among Men, think
it ſufficient to ſay their Prayers Morning and Evening, to
read a Chapter in the Bible, and go duely to hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at Church upon a <hi>Sunday:</hi> If they acquit themſelves
of theſe Duties, they think they do enough; and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62815:38"/>
the Contempt and Neglect of ſacred things now a-days,
their Piety is to be commended. But MARY'S Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was not circumſcrib'd within theſe Narrow Limits:
In the Morning ſo ſoon as ſhe roſe, ſhe ſpent Two hours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in her Bed-Chamber, in Prayers, in Reading, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Heavenly Things. If Affairs of Moment
call'd her ſooner to the Publick Management, ſhe rather
choſe to ſpare ſomething of her accuſtomed Hours allowed
for Sleep and Reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to loſe a Moment of the time which
ſhe had conſecrated to God. About Nine a clock ſhe went
to the Chappel, and there with the Royal Houſhold, and
ſuch others as mov'd by her Example reſorted thither, ſhe
offered up her moſt Innocent Supplications to God. The
ſame thing ſhe did every day about five a Clock. Nor would
ſhe ſuffer her ſelf to be called away from this ſettled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of ſacred Duties, by any Sports, and Allurements
of Lawful Pleaſures, any Audiences of Princes, or Royal
Embaſſadors.</p>
                  <p>This was the Law which ſhe had Ordain'd to her ſelf of
daily attoning God. O ſingular and unwonted lover of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in that ſo high ſtation of Fortune, in that healthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Youthful Age, in that abundance of Delights and
Pleaſures, wherein Devotion is but little minded! And this
is that, which I am ſure you all admire. Attend, I beſeech
ye, and ye ſhall hear thoſe things which will redound to the
greater Admiration of the QUEEN. When <hi>WILLIAM,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Sollicited and Importun'd by the Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
and loud Voice of <hi>England,</hi> to vindicate her Sacred
Rites, that were Polluted, to aſſert her Laws, that were
trampled underfoot, to ward off the Deſtruction and Bondage
that hung over the Necks of all the People of <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Europe</hi> that was wounded through her ſides; by a certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
of Heaven, and with the good will of all Kings and
Princes, thoſe excepted who deſign'd and Plotted all theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62815:39"/>
Miſchiefs, he undertook the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Expedition. Then it
was, that the moſt Pious <hi>MARY</hi> ſpent, not only three or
four Hours, as ſhe was wont to do, in Prayers, in Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
and as well in publick as Domeſtick Performances
of Divine Duties. When ſhe had performed 'em all in
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhe went to the <hi>French</hi> Church, and after that
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations; in all which, Prayers were put
up for ſeveral hours for the Preſervation of the Greateſt
Prince, and for the proſperous Succeſs of that Expedition
undertaken for the Preſervation of the Chriſtian Name, and
the Defence of its Dignity. No wonder then that Heaven,
whoſe Cauſe was then the Subject of the Contention, bow'd
down a ready Ear to the Suppliant and moſt Pious <hi>MARY,</hi>
and the Prayers of ſo many good People. But I return to
<hi>MARY</hi>'s daily Meditations of Piety. The reſt of the day,
which required not her Care of the Kingdom, in the King's
abſence, ſhe did not waſt in vain Diſcourſes, in hearing ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Amours of Princes and Illuſtrious Ladies, nor in
reading thoſe Trifles, commonly called Novels; but ſhe read
over her ſelf, or cauſed to be recited by others, either the
Divine Monuments of Sacred Story, or ſuch other Books
as explain'd the Myſterious Heads of Chriſtian Doctrine,
or by wholſome Precepts ſtir'd her up to the leading of an
Honeſt and Vertuous life. She was ſo taken with reading the
Sacred Scriptures, which the Prophets and other Coeleſtial
Authors Inſpir'd by God delivered in Writing, that ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
laid it out of her Hands, but twice a year read it over
from the beginning to the end, once her ſelf in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
then again in her Chappel, where in the daily ſervice ſo
much was recited every day by the Miniſter, as would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to compleat the going through the whole Book within
the Year. Is there any one among Us, moſt Noble Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the Miniſters themſelves, who have ſo Aſſiduouſly in
their hands the Divine Oracles? Is there any one who with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62815:39"/>
ſo much Affection, ſo much Diligence, or rather with ſo
much Benefit to themſelves? This Queen had ſearched ſo
profoundly into the Doctrines, of Chriſtian Religion, ſhe
had ſo imbib'd it, ſhe had ſo retain'd it in her memory, that
ſhe excell'd moſt men, who had ſpent all their Lives in the
Study of this Coeleſtial Doctrine: So that ſhe was able ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
to refel the Impetuous Violences of thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
might and main, to ſtop the Foundations of Truth.
Nor could ſhe by any Allurements, by any Threats, by any
Dangers be deterr'd from defending the true Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I ſee not a few, who have hitherto heard what I have
ſaid, with impartial Ears, contract their Brows, and ſilently
wonder at my Boldneſs, who have attributed thoſe things to
a Queen but young in Years, which few could attain to, who
have grown Old in the Study of Divinity, ſo far as to accuſe
me of foul Adulation; or of that Levity, of which ſome O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
are guilty, who being carried away with an Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Love of thoſe things, which they have deſign'd to
praiſe, aggravate their Encomiums, with expreſſions too far
ſtrain'd, and extol what they praiſe to an higher pitch, than
what it truly deſerves.</p>
                  <p>I fear leſt they ſhould lay to my Charge what in the
laſt Age was laid to the Charge of <hi>Walter Haddon,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Requeſts to Great <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Glory of the Britiſh Queens, by <hi>Jerome Oſorius,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Sylvia</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> a moſt Eloquent Perſon in
his time. <hi>Haddon</hi> had anſwer'd an Epiſtle of <hi>Oſorius,</hi>
written to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> wherein the Biſhop had moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
inveigh'd againſt Innovators, as he call'd 'em: in
this Anſwer <hi>Haddon</hi> had extoll'd the Queens Prudence in
Eccleſiaſtical Matters, and admoniſh'd <hi>Oſorius</hi> that he
ſhould take heed leſt the Queen ſhould brandiſh the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of her Studies againſt him. This <hi>Oſorius</hi> took
ill in his defamatory Anſwers to <hi>Haddon</hi>'s Defence, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62815:40"/>
taxed him for Imprudent Flattery. <hi>Oſorius</hi> allow'd, that
he could eaſily ſuffer Elegancy of Wit and Learning, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, and
deep reading in Philoſophy to be applauded in a Queen;
but for a Woman to be extoll'd for her Knowledge in
Divinity, was a thing neither to be endur'd nor believ'd.
Nevertheleſs then <hi>Elizabeth</hi> exceeded <hi>Mary</hi> in Years. But
I ſhall eaſily, moſt Noble Auditors, wipe off from my
ſelf the ſuſpicion of Adulation, if, as hitherto you have
done, you will lend me an attentive Ear.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could do I ſhall not now diſpute; what
<hi>Mary</hi> did I ſhall faithfully relate without any Rhetorical
Colours, a thing worthy for all Nations to hear. Then
do you be Judges, whether I have ſpoken like a Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or, as others more ſoftly ſay, like an Orator; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plainly, truly, and faithfully.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>JAMES</hi> the Father of <hi>MARY,</hi> when he came
to the Crown, employ'd all his Cares and Thoughts, and
made it his Buſineſs to repeal ſeveral Acts which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
had made for the Support of the Reform'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
more eſpecially to aboliſh the Law which enacted ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Teſt, which abjur'd all Power and Authority
which the Pope, or any other Mortal claim'd, or could
claim either in Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Matters within the
Kingdom. <hi>MARY</hi> openly declar'd that ſhe could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his Conduct, nor aſſent to thoſe who urg'd that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be abſolv'd from the Sanctity and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Oath, nor that any one for the future was to be forc'd
to it. The King inform'd of this, order'd his Envoy,
then at the <hi>Hague,,</hi> to make it out to <hi>MARY,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her, that ſhe had a wrong Opinion, enduc'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by falſe Reaſons and Grounds of her Father's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Meaning in that Particular. The Envoy taking
a fit Opportunity, held the Queen in a long Diſcourſe upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62815:40"/>
this Subject, bringing not a few, nor thoſe Vulgar Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
out of Scripture, many Teſtimonies out of the moſt
Ancient and moſt Learned Fathers oſ the Church, and
more than one Reaſon from the Knowledge of things which
Nature has imprinted in our Minds. When the Queen
had attentively heard him, She did not anſwer him with
a Laconiſm; ſhe ſo readily and ſo ſmartly of a ſudden
took to pieces the Envoy's Diſcourſe, and his Arguments,
refuted all his Reaſons with ſo much Judgment, that
when the Envoy was diſmiſſed by the Queen, he could
not forbear teſtifying and acknowledging in the publick
Hall of the Court, before a great many Perſons of high
Quality and Dignity, that he could never have believed
there had been a Woman in the World endued with ſo much
underſtanding of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
urged to her upon the ſeveral Heads of that Doctrine;
or that could defend what ſhe thought with ſo much ſtrength
and weight of Reaſon, and fortify it with ſo ſtrong a Guard
againſt all aſſaults of open Hoſtility or Treacherous Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                  <p>He added moreover, that he was perſwaded, that this
Princeſs could be mov'd by no man living from thoſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning Religion, wherewith ſhe was ſo throughly
ſeaſoned. Nor would he be the occaſion that any One ſhould
attempt to Diſcourſe her any more upon that occaſion, unleſs
he intended to loſe his Labour: And this was what he alſo
wrote to King <hi>James.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In this Conference with the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Agent the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Princeſs added thus much farther,</hi> That ſhe could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
admire, nor indeed imagin how it ſhould come to paſs, that
any man, not void of Reaſon or Sence, or that had a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God and Divine matters, or had comprehended in his
mind the true manner of Worſhipping him, could prove a Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and run from our Religion to the Ceremonies of <hi>Rome.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62815:41"/>
When the Agent Replied, that her Father, the King
of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>was a living Example of a better
Approbation of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Worſhip. She made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>
That there was nothing griev'd her more; and the only
thing ſhe wonder'd at, by whoſe ſeduction, upon what occaſion, by
what arguments he could be induced to betray the Bulwork of pureſt
Truth; and having left that, upon what ſupporters, the Security
and Tranquillity of his mind could rely. <hi>Theſe things the moſt
Wiſe and Prudent MARY.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after, when there was no queſtion but that King
<hi>James</hi> had been Certified of all theſe things by his Agent's
Letters; the Father ſends a long and weighty Epiſtle to his
Daughter, wherein he ſet forth at large the occaſion, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and methods he had followed in abandoning our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and embracing the Opinions of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Letter
from King <hi>James</hi> was delivered to MARY, upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> in
the Evening; the Meſſengers who brought it, being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>England</hi> the next day. Wherefore, when ſhe had
read it over and over again with extraordinary attention, and
Studiouſly conſidered every thing; ſhe ſet her ſelf to return
an Anſwer, wherein ſhe ſpent the greateſt part of the Night.
And tho frequently put in mind that it was time to go to
Bed, and that it behov'd her to take care of her Health,
which would be much diſorder'd by Watching; the moſt
Prudent Queen made Anſwer, <hi>That the Duty of Anſwering the
King's Letters, was to be preferr'd before Sleep, leſt ſhe ſhould
be ſtraitned in time the next day, and thereby be hindred from
performing what ſhe ow'd to her Father.</hi> That therefore ſhe
made the more haſte, leſt if the Meſſenger ſhould ſlip away
vvithout her Anſvver, it might be ſuſpected that ſhe had
made uſe of help, and got ſome Divine to vvrite her Letters
for her; vvhich if her Father ſhould believe, they vvould
vvant that vveight and Effect, vvhich by the Favour of God,
ſhe promiſed her ſelf from diſpatching 'em vvith all ſpeed ſhe
could.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62815:41"/>
The King's chief Argument was taken from the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the long and immovable endurance of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, Eſtabliſh'd and Founded upon the Promiſes of
Chriſt; <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c. To which were added other
places, Arguments and Teſtimonies heaped together to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate
that Opinion. All which the moſt ingenious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
Anſwered and refuted in ſo ſhort a time, and with ſo
much Politeneſs and Judgment, that an Eminent Divine, and
ſome few other Perſons, conſpicuous for their Quality and
Integrity, who afterwards were permitted to ſee a Copy of
that Epiſtle, raviſh'd into Admiration, aſſerted, that they
could never have perſwaded themſelves that ſuch a Letter,
ſo full of Grave and Efficacious Arguments, could have
been Written by any Man, much leſs by a Woman, unleſs
by one who had Devoted his whole Life to the Study of the
Scriptures, and true Divinity. Strange ſwiftneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacity
of a Divine Wit! Strange piercing Force of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
No ſnares of Treachery were ſo occultly laid, which
the Auguſt Queen did not readily diſcover; no Sophiſms ſo
fallaciouſly ſpecious, that could deceive Her; No knots ſo
difficult, but ſhe ſhould unlooſe 'em at firſt ſight. Go now,
you that are all over nothing but Envy or ill Will; you that
are blinded by your own ignorance, weigh the vaſt Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Greateſt of Queens, by the Exilities of your
own ſlender Parts, go now and taunt me with <hi>Adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Oration is ſo far from flattery, that all men now may
ſee, that the greateſt applauſe of Words is far inferior to the
Merits of ſo great a Queen. Such was alſo the ſanctity of
MARY'S Life, that King WILLIAM, after her
Deceaſe, calling to mind her Piety toward God, the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her Life, and her Extraordinary Knowledge of ſacred
things, brake forth into this Evpreſſion, <hi>That if he could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ever any mortal man could be born without the contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62815:42"/>
of ſin, he would believe it of the Queen.</hi> And ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
her ſelf ſo chaſt and ſpotleſs, that while ſhe reſided
upon Earth, ſhe liv'd the Life of the Saints, even in the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Court, where there are ſo many incitements to evil,
that entice men from the Exerciſe of Piety, ſo many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to pleaſure, that inveigle and bewitch the mind.</p>
                  <p>But as our Divine MARY burn'd with a ſingular Love
of Piety and Religion, ſo was ſhe of a Soaring and Exalted
Mind. For they, who addicting themſelves to the Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the moſt pure Religion, are once aſſur'd, that being
as it were encompaſs'd with Coeleſtial Protection, they ſhall
not be forſaken, will never deſpond, let the Confuſions of
War Rage round about 'em, let the Earth Tremble, and
Heaven be ready to fall, and all things menace preſent Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and Peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>As to her Contempt of Humane Glory, her Conſtancy in
the moſt violent Storms of Adverſe Fortune, I wiſh, as they
are great things, and Aggravations of her lofty Soul, I wiſh
it were in my power to ſet forth in as magnificent Language!
<hi>The Field is infinitely large of rare and unuſual Examples;</hi> but
neither the barrenneſs of a ſlender Wit, nor the ſtraitneſs
of my Time will permit me to expatiate into theſe Boundleſs
Themes. We muſt be content with a Few.</p>
                  <p>How great was the Conſternation of all men, how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
the Diſmay and Terror, when <hi>William,</hi> Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
not ſo much Invited and Requeſted by <hi>England,</hi> tho
ſhe ſtretched forth her ſuppliant Hands to Him for ſuccour, as
by the Call of Heaven, at an unſeaſonable time, when both
<hi>Seas and Adverſe Winds</hi> with tumultuous Fury oppoſing him,
with ſuch an handful haſten'd to <hi>England's</hi> Relief, under the
Oppreſſion of Numerous Armies, I believe that moſt of you
remember. For we may ſooner forget our ſelves than ſuch
a dreadful ſeaſon. Only MARY undaunted awaited the
Event of Heaven's Decrees; She Only wanted no Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62815:42"/>
She alone exhorted and confirm'd the Trembling; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh
Fear in Men, in MARY Manly Reſolution and
Courage vvas to be ſeen. Theſe vvere Noble Things, and
to be celebrated vvith the Encomiums of all <hi>Ages</hi> and all
Men. And yet they are but Sport and Play, if I may ſo call
'em, to vvhat you ſhall now hear. An Hideous Bulk of
threatning Evils at the ſame time roul'd vvith all its Force to
overwhelm all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> The Heaven, the Sea
and Land ſeem'd to have conſpired their ruin and deſtruction.
The Army of the Confederates had received a deep wound
in the Battle of <hi>Fleurus.</hi> In the ſight of <hi>England</hi> a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
befel our <hi>Fleet,</hi> ſome of our Men of War being ſunk
and burnt; whilſt others were detain'd by contrary Winds,
from ſuccouring thoſe that were o're Powred. From <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
News was brought, tho ours had Vanquiſh'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> that the King was Wounded, in the heat of
the Fight, with a Canon Bullet. The Report was ſpread
abroad that he was ſlain, inſomuch that publick Rejoycings
were ordered at <hi>Paris</hi> by publick Authority, in a Tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Night, and all the Streets and Houſes Blaz'd and Shon
with Illuminations and Bonfires, the ſigns I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether of Joy or Madneſs, not to be defac'd by
length of Time, as if the VVar had been at an end, had the
King of <hi>England</hi> been Dead. All theſe things were at the
ſame time tumultuouſly repeated, while Fame augmented, as
is uſual, every thing for the worſe. To this we may add how
certainly it was believed that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Land a great <hi>Army</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which was to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into the Heart of the Kingdom, naked then of Military
Defence; the Souldie<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y being either in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the <hi>Low
Countries.</hi> 'Tis hardly to be imagin'd how great the Fear
the Dread, the Conſternation was of the Nobility, Gentry
and common People. Still the Queen diſplayed no ſign of
Fear, nothing of dubious anxiety, nothing of ſadneſs either
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62815:43"/>
in her looks or words; more Eſpecially when ſhe heard,
that the Wound in the King's ſhoulder was neither Mortal
nor Dangerous. MARY at that time Rode through the
City of <hi>London,</hi> with ſo Serene a Countenance, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and Security ſeem'd to ſhine in her Eyes. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beholding the Queen ſo void of any Perturbation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
and recovered themſelves from their extraordinary
Conſternation. Nor were the People only refreſhd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
with chearful Hearts and Countenances, but alſo the
Nobility, the King and Queen's Friends and ſharers of all
their <hi>Arcana.</hi> For when the Queen ſhewed the ſame mind
in Council, no leſs ſedate and Void of Tumult; ſo ſoon as
ſhe was gone, a perſon of the Higheſt Quality and Dignity
acknowledg'd that after he had ſeen and heard the Queen, he
was much more Confirm'd in his Mind than before. That
ſo many Meſſengers of ill News from all parts, one upon the
Neek of another, had ſtrook a dread into him, and a very
great fear of more terrible Calamities, but that now he was
releaſt from his Fears, in regard that neither in the Queen's
Countenance, nor in her Words, he perceived not the leaſt
ſign of any Perturbation or Anxiety; but that ſhe ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
for the general Good with the ſame conſtancy as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
that with the ſame Advice and Judgment, ſhe took
care that nothing ſhould fall out amiſs at Home, that the
publick ſhould receive no damage; and provided abroad,
how Miſcarriages might be attoned, loſſes repaired, and the
Counſels of the Enemy be diſappointed. Theſe things when
he ſaw, he could not ſufficiently Admire the Incredible For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Queen, nor could he believe the loſs was ſo great,
or Affairs in ſo ill a Condition, as they were generally
thought to be. What an Illuſtrious Perſon ſo much admir'd,
all Nations, all Poſterity will wonder at. That there was
ſo much Reſolution in a Woman, that ſhe could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by the ſevereſt Frowns of adverſe Fortune, that would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62815:43"/>
have ſhaken, and did ſhake the Courage and Counſels of Men
themſelves. <hi>Octavianus Caeſar,</hi> when he heard of the <hi>Varian</hi>
Slaughter, fooliſhly ſuffered his Hair and Beard to grow, as
if the <hi>Germans</hi> had been afraid of his careleſs Beard, like men
that are terrified with the ſtreaming Tail of a Comet. He
wept like a Woman, beat his Head for madneſs againſt the
Wall, and like a man that had been Frantick, cry'd out,
<hi>Varus, Reſtore me back my Legions;</hi> as if theſe Clamours
could have Terrified the Enemy, or that the Slain could have
thereby reviv'd. And this ſame Deſpair and Female Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity
of Mind, the ſame <hi>Auguſtus</hi> betray'd, as if <hi>Hannibal</hi>
had been at the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> when three Legions were
Defeated by the <hi>Germans</hi> in the utmoſt Confines of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But what did our Couragious and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Queen do, when the Army was Routed in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<hi>Low Countries;</hi> when in the very ſight and throat of
<hi>England,</hi> the Enemies Navy, numerous and Victorious, Rode
Miſtreſs of the Seas; when Rapines, Burnings, Slaughters,
Deſolation, preſented themſelves before the Eyes of all men;
if the Enemy, which many were afraid of, which wicked
Subjects boaſted abroad, and Rebels wiſh'd, had turn'd their
Forces againſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shoar, in the King's abſence, and
while the Arms of <hi>England</hi> were Employ'd either in our Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
or in <hi>Ireland?</hi> Nothing of all theſe things mov'd
MARY's Courage; She did not yield to raging Torture, or
ſubmit her Courage to it; but the more boldly made reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with an undaunted Vertue, never to be ſufficiently Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd
by human Expreſſions; and with ſuch a ſublimity of
Mind, whereby ſhe not only overcame the Opinion of all
men, but her ſelf out-did her ſelf; by which ſhe attained
to ſuch a Degree of Glory and Dignity, as a Prince of higheſt
Vertue can hardly be allowed to wiſh for in this Life.</p>
                  <p>No leſs Conſpicuous was the Excellency of her lofty Mind
in moderat Proſperity, as in her Couragious Brooking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62815:44"/>
She never proudly abuſed ſo great a Power; never
in that moſt Towering Station of Human Affairs, utter'd an
haughty word, or did an unequal Act. For it was always
her Opinion, that Royal Majeſty conſiſted not in the Enſigns
of Royalty, the Globe, the Scepter or the Crown; but in
Vertuous Ornaments, in Gentleneſs, and the Power of doing
Good to all People; and was deſirous it ſhould be conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for Sanctity and Sweetneſs of Manners, and Nobleneſs
of Mind; not in ſwelling Pride, in haughty Pride, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
diſdain of her Subjects, and of all other Men,
with the Cecropide arrogated to themſelves, and Men of
mean Condition, advanc'd above themſelves to ſplendidneſs
of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Nor did the Queen more laudably excel in Majeſty of
Empire, than in Modeſty; of which how many Examples
did ſhe ſhew to the World? But this was moſt ſingular and
wonderful. She was call'd by the People of <hi>England,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with her Husband <hi>William,</hi> to be his Aſſociate in the
Kingdom, that as ſhe was the Confort of his Bed, ſhe might
be the Companion of his Scepter, and that they might Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the Government with equal Auſpices. This Power
ſhe never exerciſed, unleſs when the King, in Vindicating
and Aſſerting the Liberty of the Chriſtian World, was thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
with Arms abroad upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Scheld,</hi> or the
<hi>Boyne,</hi> and going to croſs the Seas, committed the Reines of
the Kingdom into her Right-hand; which ſhe rul'd ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
with the general Applauſe of all Men, in the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
times, that none of her Subjects could perceive the
King was abſent. The King was wanting in his Perſon, no
body miſs'd his Courage or his Prudence. In Council, when
Affairs of greateſt Moment and Intricacy were Diſcuſs'd,
the moſt prudent Queen ne're heſitated, never was at a
ſtand; ſuch was her Diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch her Diſcernment, ſo
Capacious was her Counſel, that ſhe ſaw with a moſt pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62815:44"/>
Eye, what was needful to be done, and readily found
out the Expedient, which way things were to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd.
For ſhe had a Wiſe proſpect into Futurity, that ſhe
might be thought to Propheſy, rather than Pronounce De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees;
and Judg'd ſo truly of this preſent, that ſhe might
be thought to have deriv'd every ſentence ſhe ſpoke from
ſome Oracular Anſwer of a Deity. So that the King might
deſervedly complain, when he loſt our moſt Prudent MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY,
that he had loſt the beſt of all the Counſellors he had
in his Council. You have heard a moſt true ſaying of great
WILLIAM, who himſelf, as well in Military Courage,
as in the Wiſdom of Peace, is ſecond to none of all the
Kings that are, or ever were. He could never perform ſuch
great things abroad, unleſs he had thoſe at home upon
whoſe Fidelity and Counſel he might rely: For never at
any time more certain Ship-wrack threatens a Common-wealth,
than when ſuch a one ſits at the Helm, who wants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to be Steer'd and Govern'd himſelf. But ſo far was the
Queen from depending upon the Counſel of others, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, they who were of the Council, were convinc'd by
her Arguments, and came over to her Opinion, tho before
they Diſſented from it: And many times ſhe greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
thoſe who waver'd between ſeveral Opinions.</p>
                  <p>What need I call to your Remembrance, the Vigilancy of
the Queen? Day and Night, as in a Watch-Tower, ſhe
watch'd over the ſafety and Dignity of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces.</hi> She never look'd off from their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
She laid nothing more to Heart than the Publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Liberty, the Eaſe of the People, the Harmony and
Union of the Parliament, and the Harmony and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the whole Common-wealth. It was the moſt ſacred of
all her Cares, to Govern her Subjects with a concording Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
Which when ſhe perform'd to a Miracle, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on the other ſide, in the mortal Perſon of the Queen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62815:45"/>
the Preſent Immortal God, whoſe Image on Earth
all ſupreme Powers Repreſent, ſo long as they faithfully and
prudently fulfil all the Duties of juſt and legal Rule.</p>
                  <p>By this means ſhe not only ſuppreſs'd, not ſo much by
force of Arms, as by the Love of her Subjects, with which
ſhe was always ſtrongly Guarded, from the Exorbitant Fury
of Wicked Men, who during the King's abſence, Plotted
her Ruin and the Deſtruction of the Kingdom. Theſe are
Great things, and to be Celebrated by the Tongues and Pens
of Poſterity: Yet will I not contend with thoſe who aſſert
that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire was Govern'd by <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with no
leſs Applauſe of Prudence and Moderation. But this is
wonderful and unuſual, that a Queen, when ſhe ſate at the
Helm in the King's abſence, all good ſubjects wiſhing all
Proſperity to ſo juſt and mild a Rule; while others were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh'd,
that the Rudder of Government ſhould be ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and knowingly held by a Female Hand; ſo ſoon as
the King ſet foot again in the Kingdom, ſhould not concern
her ſelf with any part or care of it, as if ſhe had not been
marry'd to the King, or that the Adminiſtration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had nothing belongd to her, tho his Aſſociate in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Read over the Annals, Noble Auditors, of all
Times and Nations; revolve in your Memories whether
you ever read or heard of any thing that may be compar'd
with this Moderation of the Queen. There have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Queens, many Princeſſes, who have taken upon 'em Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
Cares, who have either had Uxorious Husbands, or
have been by them willingly permitted to ſhare the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
with 'em. You ſhall find no Woman, who being
call'd by the Legal Suffrages of the People, to be an Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in the Government, who ever actually executed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Office, that did not challenge her ſelf a great ſhare of
the Command, and thought ſhe had an Injury done her, if
ſhe were not admitted to all Counſels taken concerning the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62815:45"/>
Adminiſtration of the Government, or if ſhe were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
with in all manner of Tranſactions; or if ſhe were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in Authority with her Husband, did not challenge to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
an Equal Right. They who have once taſted Soveraign
Command, are hardly reduc'd to lead a private Life. You
may ſooner wreſt <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Club out of his hand, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Dominion from ſuch perſons, eſpecially from the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Sex, who are generally Petulant, Proud, greedy of
Power, Covetous of Command, and expert at putting all
things into confuſion, ſo they may attain their Deſires. That
She <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> that ſhe might not be deſpoil'd of that Power
which ſhe had exercis'd ſo many years by the connivance
of her Husband, extinguiſhd all <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Family by
her Treacheries, Frauds, and wicked Contrivances; not ſo
much out of her Novercal Hatred, though that were alſo
none of the leaſt violent; but inflam'd with deſire of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that ſhe might advance her own Son to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and rule under his Minority as ſhe had done before
under the Indulgence of her Husband. Infinite other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Female Pride, and Deſire of Rule, might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
which neither Time nor Place will give us leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.
And indeed who can be ignorant of 'em, when every
Age has produc'd ſeveral ſuch Monſters? So much the more
is the Moderation of Divine <hi>Mary</hi> to be wonder'd at, who
might have Reign'd in her own Right, but would not, but in
the Abſence of King <hi>William;</hi> and who was ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
or repining, that ſhe gladly and freely reſign'd the
Government of the Kingdom upon his Return, as an hard
and heavy burthen, which ſhe had unwillingly born all the
time before.</p>
                  <p>Where can a Moderation like to this be found, within the
memory of Hiſtory? She thought it the Greateſt, and moſt
Noble Act of Soveraignty, to be able to command her ſelf.
Thoſe Tears, which were no counterfeited Droppings, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62815:46"/>
which ſhe ſhed when ſhe underſtood that the Crown was
Voted to Her and <hi>William,</hi> by both Houſes of Parliament;
what elſe did they ſignifie, but that <hi>MARY</hi>'s Mind was
far remote from all deſire of Rule? Remember, I beſeech
ye, with what Grief and Reluctancy ſhe ſuffer'd her ſelf to
be torn from our Re-publick. But it was not for her to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the hidden Counſels of Eternal Providence. She was
to go where Deſtiny call'd her, not with an Intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
her Father, as an audacious Impoſtor lately took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to vomit forth againſt the moſt Pious Queen: For the
Father had dethron'd himſelf by his ſubverſion of the Laws,
the Religion and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, before any
Forreigner mov'd to the Relief of <hi>England;</hi> but that ſhe
might ſuccour her Country, forſaken, complaining, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and imploring the Aid of Heaven, and the Faith of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and <hi>Mary.</hi> For this was the Only Remedy for <hi>Britain</hi>
upon the Brink of the Precipice; nor had ſhe any other to
whom in her Deſpair ſhe could have Recourſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore did <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſtretch forth her Right Hand
to <hi>MARY,</hi> when ſhe came, and received their Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix
with a more than Ordinary Joy. Thence a New and
Benign Light, in the midſt of ſo great a Miſt and ſo dark a
Night, ſpread a bright, ſplendour quite through <hi>Britain,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that the day wherein <hi>MARY</hi> and <hi>WILLIAM</hi>
were inaugurated, might be accounted <hi>England</hi>'s Second
Birth-day, that wip'd off Ruſty Decrepidneſs and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
from a Kingdom gayly flouriſhing before. But the
Spring and Fountain of this wonderful Modeſty, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole courſe of her Life, ſhe made appear by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Rare Proofs to the whole World, was that, of which
you have been told already, <hi>Her Piety and Obſervance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
From thence proceeded that undefiled Conjugal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
that Chaſtity without blemiſh, that Benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
all Mankind, that Munificence and Bounty toward the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62815:46"/>
miſerable. If ever any Woman, eminent above others; for
the Splendor of her Deſcent, and Excellency of her Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Form, were the moſt affectionate to her Husband,
and the moſt jealous of her Chaſtity, <hi>DIVA ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TA</hi>
was ſhe. Who ever knew a Wife more Obedient in a
private Family? I here forbear to relate with what an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Grief ſhe parted from her <hi>William</hi>'s ſide, when ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forward, and ready to quit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shoar in order to
reſtore the Low Condition of <hi>Europe</hi>'s Affairs. I neglect to
tell, with how much Joy and Affection ſhe received the King
returning from the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Theſe are the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Commendations of all Wives; but what I ſhall now
commemorate, is a ſingular and moſt Illuſtrious Pledg, of a
certain, more than wonderful Affection.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>James,</hi> confiding in an haſty Flight, deſerted
the Kingdom, and left the Royal Throne quite Empty and
in a manner falling, it was Debated in the Convention, who
ſhould be ſet up in <hi>James</hi>'s Room; whether the Enſigns of
Soveraignty ſhould be Offered to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and
<hi>Mary</hi> his Conſort, to Reign with Equal Power; or to <hi>Mary</hi>
only, the Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>James,</hi> and in her Right to
<hi>William</hi> her Husband. Many were of the laſt Opinion, but
upon this Condition, that <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be Crown'd Queens;
but that the Adminiſtration of the Government, ſhould by
Authority of Parliament, be committed to Prince <hi>William,</hi>
as <hi>Mary's</hi> Husband, The Reſident of a Certain Prince,
who then Reſided in <hi>England,</hi> ſo ſoon as he underſtood theſe
things, though but uncertainly reported, over-haſty and
credulous, as if the Thing had been already determined, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
hires a Meſſenger, and orders him with all the ſpeed i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable,
to carry the News to his Maſter, that MARY
the Eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>James</hi> was by Decree of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be the next day Proclaim'd Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62815:47"/>
The Meſſenger was to paſs through the <hi>Hague,</hi> and to
impart the News in the Reſidents Name to a Perſon of High
Authority, and no leſs high both in <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.
He immediately haſtens to the Court, and informs
<hi>Mary</hi> of this Vote of the Houſe, and congratulates her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to the Royal Dignity. She, according to her
wonted Good Nature, mildly indeed, but with a leſs famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Countenance, and a more contracted Brow, made Anſwer,
<hi>That ſhe neither hop'd thoſe things to be true, which he related,
neither did ſhe believe that</hi> William <hi>would accept the Kingdom,
as a Subſtitute to Female Authority, or as one that was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to a Woman for a Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beſeech ye, Noble Auditors, could the beſt of Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
declare the Exceſs of her moſt tender Affection by a more
Illuſtrious Argument? She had rather that her ſelf, ſhe
had rather that her Husband ſhould loſe a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that he ſhould receive it as her Gift; or that <hi>William</hi>
ſhould obtain by Female Favour, what he had deſerv'd by
the ſuffrage of his own Valour, as having undergone ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Toyls and Dangers for the Preſervation of it. Hence,
when ſome Peers of the higheſt Rank, who wiſh'd well to
MARY, obſtinately urg'd, <hi>That the Kingdom ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to</hi> William <hi>upon no other Conditions than thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and aſſerted, that it would be a means to fix themſelves in</hi>
MARY's <hi>Favonr;</hi> She took it ſo unkindly, and after ſhe
was Crown'd Queen, openly complain'd of their Prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Argument; nor would, for a good while, admit thoſe
who had Voted after that manner, to kiſs her Royal Hand;
nor did admit 'em, till after ſome time that ſhe was at laſt
over-rul'd by the <hi>King.</hi> What could be done more Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
or what greater Teſtimony of Affection could Fiction
invent? By what <hi>greater Argument</hi> could ſhe demonſtrate
that nothing was dearer to her than her Husband? Neither
Scepter nor Crown, for the ſake of which, many Women
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62815:47"/>
abjure their Chaſtity, their Religion, all Veneration Divine
and Human; if ſeparated from King <hi>William</hi>'s Intereſts,
which ſhe always prefer'd before her own. Oh ſingular
Conjugal Fidelity; O admirable Affection, of a Queen, that
never can be too highly Applauded! Infinite are the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of this her wonderful and incredible Affection toward
the King, which we have not Language nor time ſufficient
to Enumerate. However, one in the midſt of ſo much
Plenty moſt Illuſtrious, muſt not be omitted.</p>
                  <p>In the Eeighty fourth year of this Age, the Embaſſador
of a certain King, not neceſſary here to be Nam'd, Plotted
an unworthy Contrivance at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and had Sollicited
certain of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Attendants to Aſſociate
with him; which come to Light, ſo highly Incens'd a Prince,
at other times ſo mild and gentle as to incur a Cenſure of
being ſlow, that he could not diſſemble his Anger. The
King recall'd his Embaſſadour from the <hi>Hague,</hi> no doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the Juſt reaſon of the Prince's Indignation againſt
him. The Embaſſadour therefore, knowing that Kings and
Princes have long hands, was willing, before his departure,
to reconcile himſelf to Prince <hi>William.</hi> To which purpoſe
making his Addreſſes, and ſubmiſſively, and with humble
Proteſtations of his Innocency, and Deprecating his Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the moſt Mild of Princes Magnanimouſly forgave him.
But from <hi>Mary,</hi> by no Allegations, by no Expiations of
Satisfaction whatever, could he obtain his Pardon. Upon
which, when it was admir'd that <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be ſo impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
when the Embaſſadour had done nothing againſt Her,
nor had injur'd Her either in word or deed, when <hi>William,</hi>
Juſtly offended had pardon'd the Delinquent, ſhe order'd
this Anſwer to be made, <hi>That had the Crime been committed
againſt her, ſhe would not have been either ſevere, or inexorable;
but that ſhe could not forget an Attempt againſt her Husband, nor
grant her Pardon ſo eaſily to him, who had ſo highly offended</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62815:48"/>
William. Who can ſufficiently extol this Conjugal Fidelity,
this unuſual Affection of a Queen toward a Husband? For
my part, I am not able to Admire it as I ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Queen belov'd with leſs Affection by the King,
than was the King belov'd by Her. <hi>There was no need of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to renew their Love;</hi> but ſuch was the Harmonious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of their Minds and Counſels from the firſt day of
their Auſpicious Marriage, that their Wills were ſtill the
ſame, whatever pleas'd, whatever diſlik'd the one, always
diſlik'd, ſtill pleas'd the other; ſuch an Agreement of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in all things, both private and publick, that tho in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
divided by long Intervals of diſtant Leagues, yet by
an unaccountable Sympathy, they were always of one mind
in all Affairs moſt difficult, and of dubious Event, which
would have puzled the moſt acute and experienc'd <hi>Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
So that they might be ſaid to be Born under one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,
but rather that one Soul reſided in two Bodies.
And that you may not think I ſpeak a Fiction; behold an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a reall Harmony of Minds, almoſt beyond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p>About three years ago, at what time the King arriv'd in
<hi>Holland,</hi> Intelligence was ſent from no mean Hands, nor from
one place, to the King here preſent, to the Queen in <hi>England</hi>
then ſitting at the Helm, that the <hi>French</hi> were fitting out
a Navy, and that they intended, in a ſhort time, to put to
Sea, with a deſign to Land a conſiderable Army in <hi>England,</hi>
and with all their Might, to endeavour the Reſtoration of
King <hi>James</hi> to the Crown, that he himſelf had thrown away.
The King conſidering the Danger, was in deep ſuſpence
for ſome time, whether he ſhould return back into <hi>England,</hi>
or ſtay in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> to curb the Fury, and diſappoint
the Counſels of the Enemy. The firſt was advis'd by many
who were of the King's more ſecret Counſels in <hi>England,</hi>
and not a few of the Officers here about the King were of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62815:48"/>
the ſame Opinion. In this ſame Commotion of his Fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
Thoughts, after an anxious deliberation, the King at
length decreed, That the Yachts that wafted him hither,
ſhould be ſent back into <hi>England;</hi> but that the Men of War
that guarded him, ſhould be ſo diſpoſed of, that if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
he might be ſpeedily conveigh'd back into <hi>England:</hi>
Whither he alſo ſent word, that Forty of the Men of War,
with the Admiral, ſhould ſteer away toward the Coaſt of
<hi>France,</hi> with this Deſign, that if they found an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
they ſhould burn all the Enemies Tranſport-Ships. But
before the Yachts, and the Meſſenger who was ſent with the
King's Expreſſes, arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Queens Letters</hi> were
brought hither to the King, giving him an Account, <hi>That ſhe
had ordered a Fleet of Forty Men of War to ſail away for the
Coaſt of</hi> France, <hi>and burn the Enemies Ships which were report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be deſign'd to infeſt the</hi> Engliſh Shoar.</p>
                  <p>What Symphony could produce a more harmonious
Harmony of Notes, then this of the Opinions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of the King and Queen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the one knew nothing
of the others Mind. Inſomuch that ſimilitude of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and conſent of Minds not Fortune, ſeem'd to have
joyn'd <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> together. This is that true Love
that ſo conglutinates, and knits both Hearts together,
that nothing can be more cloſely join'd, not to be ſever'd
by any diſtance of Time or Place, and conſtitutes ſuch a
concord of Opinions that no force is able to diſſolve. Which
who ſees not in the King and Queen, and being ſeen does
not admire, muſt needs be blind and ignorant of what
is to be wondred at. Therefore in all varieties of Times
and Fortunes, the King ſtill found the greateſt ſafety in
the Love of the beſt of Queens. It was a Saying of the
King before he thought of Marriage, to <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's
Embaſſador, at a time when there happen'd an
accidental diſcourſe about the choice of Wives, that of all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62815:49"/>
the Qualities to be ſought for in a Wife, his firſt care ſhould
be to find out the <hi>Beſt-Condition'd.</hi> And he himſelf made
himſelf the Maſter of his Wiſh; for he could not have
found a better Wife, had the Sun it ſelf, according the
Proverb, been to have ſought her out.</p>
                  <p>But as the King met with his chief help and
aſſiſtance in the Queen's Love, ſo not only her Subjects,
but all others for whom it was in her Power to do
good found more than ordinary Succour in her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Nature. <hi>She thought the Day loſt, wherein ſhe had
not an opportunity to do good to ſeveral.</hi> She meaſur'd her
Felicity in that indulgent Height of Fortune by nothing
more than by her Power to render others happy. Yet
was ſhe not profuſe, nor did ſhe ſcatter her Benefits promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly,
without Judgment, or diligent Enquiry; but gave
plentifully, gave conſiderately, gave to fitting Objects. She
took more Pleaſure, if ſhe had plac'd her Charity right,
than if Princes had heap'd upon her ſelf all manner of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
and more rejoyc'd in beſtowing, than they who
wanted in receiving. She never forgot thoſe Benefits which
ſhe receiv'd from others, but ſtill recalling 'em to Mind,
never ſuffer'd to ſlip out of her Memory. What ſhe
beſtow'd upon others, ſhe ſcarce remember'd, as if ſhe had
loſt her Memory. I wiſh I could find Words to ſet forth
the flowing Liberality of the moſt Pious Queen, and were
able ſo loudly to proclaim it, and in ſuch Language, as
that it might be heard in all Places! Sparing to herſelf,
profuſe to the miſerable and wanting, who believ'd
that ſhe herſelf enjoy'd what they receiv'd from her. How
many experienc'd the Bounty of her Munificent and Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Hand, as well in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> but more eſpecially the <hi>French</hi> Exiles, who
rather choſe to loſe their Eſtates, than to hazard the loſs of
their Souls? And the Splendor of this Benevolence ſhin'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62815:49"/>
forth in <hi>Mary</hi>'s firſt coming into this Country. For the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſo ſoon as <hi>Mary</hi> became his Conſort, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
ſuch a ſum of Money to be paid her for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Expences of her <hi>Apparel, and Princely Ornaments.</hi> What
did the Divine Princeſs do with it at thoſe Years? She did
not ſtifle the Money in cloſe and dark Cheſts, nor did ſhe
laviſh it out in gorgeous Attire, upon <hi>Pearls and Gemms;</hi>
which other Women far diſtant from her degree, are ſo
mad after, that they never ceaſe this Fury till they have
quite ruin'd their Husband's Patrimonies: But moderate
in her layings out, conſidering the Grandeur of her Fortune,
upon her Apparel and other Ornaments which the Dignity
of ſo great a Princeſs requir'd, ſhe introduc'd into the Court
<hi>Diligence, Frugality, Parſimony,</hi> Vertues moſt commonly
unknown in Courts. The reſt of that large Allowance
ſhe conſum'd in relieving the diſtreſſes of honeſt and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
People, who labour'd under great Neceſſities, not
through their own Extravagancy, but reduc'd thereto by
Misfortune, and the hardneſs of the Times. <hi>Magnanimous
Queen, ſuperiour to all Applauſe!</hi> For who is able deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to extol the Excellency of ſo bountiful and beneficent a
Soul? Where is the Woman among Ten Thouſand that
would deprive herſelf of the Money allow'd her for fine
Cloaths, and gaudy Ornaments, to beſtow upon the poor
and needy, while ſo few are contented with wearing the
ſpoils of fair Eſtates upon their Backs, and think all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent
that is not waſted upon Vanity and Finery. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
to compare the Queen with other Women, is to do an
Injury to her Divine Vertues, wherein ſhe equall'd or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Praiſes of the Greateſt Men. Nor did ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or deſire any other Fruit from this her Bounty, than
a Conſcience that told her ſhe did well. She never vaunted
her Charity, nor imputed it to Merit. Moſt commonly
ſhe ſent her Charity by Perſons unknown, who were not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62815:50"/>
permitted to diſcover the Doner, that ſhe might not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Modeſty of the Receivers. So far was ſhe from
ſeeking the Favour of thoſe on whom ſhe conferr'd her Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that ſhe deny'd 'em the Hopes of returning thanks, when
the greateſt part were ignorant who beſtow'd the unlook'd
for Liberality. <hi>Arceſilaus</hi> is highly applauded who laid a
bag of Gold under the Pillow of his poor Friend, but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
poverty all the while, that he might privately
ſupply the want of one who was needleſly modeſt. Which
Praiſes are not to be attributed to <hi>Mary;</hi> who reliev'd not
her Friends, but Forreigners and Strangers, whom ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw, whoſe Exigencies ſhe had only heard of, contrary
to their Expectation, and unlook'd for. Nor did ſhe open
thoſe Fountains of Beneficence once or twice only, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
and every Year, that ſhe might not be thought to
give out of a ſudden heat, or through weakneſs, but upon
mature Conſideration and Advice. She ſent from <hi>England</hi>
certain Perſons, who diſtributed this ſame Tribute, if I may
ſo call it, of her Liberality, and order'd 'em to make a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Report of the Condition of thoſe to whom ſhe decreed
her Charity, that ſhe might enlarge her Bounty, if what
ſhe had ſent did not ſuffice to allay the Troubles of their
Exigency. The <hi>French</hi> Fugitives deſpoil'd of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Fortune, upon which Domeſtick Harpies had
laid their Gripes, with what a plentiful Benignity ſhe
cheriſh'd, both here and in <hi>England,</hi> they themſelves are
Witneſſes. An <hi>Illuſtrious Widow</hi> dy'd, who was Married
to a Prince in <hi>Germany.</hi> To him an Annual Penſion was
owing and pay'd him out of the Common Treaſury of
the States. Therefore that this Money might be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſupport of the <hi>French,</hi> eſpecially of Noble Ladies
and Gentlewomen, who had forſaken their Country for
the ſake of Religion, and had no way to get their Living,
as having been bred up tenderly, and in the midſt of Afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62815:50"/>
at home, was a favour for which they are beholden
ſolely to the Queen: whoſe deſire of deſerving well from
the Indigent, was never tyr'd. To the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and
<hi>Vaudois,</hi> of the Reform'd Religion, exhauſted by long wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings
from Place to Place, by Hunger and Miſery, when
they return'd again to their Native Habitations, ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a Sum of Money to be ſent for the ſupport of <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Miniſters,</hi> as many Readers, and as many neceſſitous
Laymen. Nor was the moſt bountiful Queen leſs compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
upon the Seamen, who naked, ſtript, and wounded,
ſwam from the ſunk Veſſels, which the Enemy burnt. As
many as went to <hi>London,</hi> and they were not a few, were
cloathed by the Queens Command, and furniſh'd with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to ſupply their neceſſities. She took care alſo all along
the Shores of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> that the Wounded ſhould
be taken in, diligently look'd after, cur'd and kindly us'd.
To the <hi>Widows and Children</hi> of the Slain, ſhe diſpers'd her
bounty even in this Land, that their Loſſes might be repair'd
and their Sorrows allay'd. Laſtly, in all parts of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> ſhe imprinted innumerable Marks of her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Munificence and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Nor was ſhe leſs a Peculiar Specimen of Clemency than
Liberality. She rather choſe to forget than revenge Injuries.
For ſhe remember'd, that the One was the Character of the
fordid Vulgar; the Other, of thoſe who excel Other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
in Vertue and Magnanimity. Nor was ſhe inferiour for
the Commendations of Juſtice to any of the <hi>Areopagites. She
allowed nothing to Favour, nothing to Hatred.</hi> No body ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
Puniſhment or Fine, who was not more gently us'd
than he could think or hope for, had the Law been rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Executed.</p>
                  <p>Honour was beſtow'd on no Man, but the Reward far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Merits. What her Innocency and Temperance
was in the midſt of ſo much wealth, your ſelves cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62815:51"/>
who know how pious ſhe vvas; Nor have I any
thing to add as to her <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> vvhen you have heard how
entirely ſhe Lov'd the <hi>King.</hi> She could not endure a <hi>wanton
word,</hi> nor the ſight of a Woman who was reported or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have violated her modeſty. Her Womens <hi>Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
was <hi>a kind of Temple of Chaſtity, Integrity and Sanctity.</hi>
The <hi>Affability</hi> of <hi>MARY,</hi> born and bred up in a Court,
all people admir'd, more eſpecially the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when firſt
ſhe came into <hi>Holland.</hi> Before they underſtood her, many
fear'd an <hi>Imperious Miſtreſs,</hi> and the ſwelling Diſdain of thoſe
<hi>Courts,</hi> where the Name of Civility is either unheard of, or
hated. In her Dreſs, her Dyet, her Royal Ornaments, in her
Converſe, in her making and repaying of Viſits, ſhe hardly
exceeded Common Familiarity. How eaſy of acceſs to all
Perſons, and at all Hours when ſhe was at <hi>Leiſure from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip,</hi> or the Adminiſtration of the Government. For
tho ſhe ſpent her leiſure hours in reading either <hi>Hiſtory or
Geography,</hi> wherein ſhe was ſo expert, that no man knew ſo
well his own Lands and Houſe, as ſhe underſtood the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Countries, Iſlands, Kingdoms, Citys, Rivers, Mountains;</hi>
and the manners, Religion and Laws of the Inhabitants, ſo
that in this ſort of Polite Learning nothing could be more
Elegant, or accompliſhd then <hi>Mary,</hi> yet was not the Pleaſure
which ſhe took in reading ſo great, as to detain her from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
audiences to all perſons at any leiſure time. What <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaſter
or Mayor</hi> of a Town could be eaſier of acceſs, or
more freely ſpoken ſo, then this Princeſs to <hi>Hollanders</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh? Her affability and ſweet Delivery, wherewith ſhe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
all her Vertues, exceed belief.</hi> As ſhe excell'd all in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
ſo ſhe ſuffer'd none to outdo her in Humanity. I will
give you one rare Example of her extraordinary affability
and goodneſs. An <hi>Embaſſador</hi> of a great Prince, after he had
paid his Duty to <hi>Mary</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> retiring out of the
Chamber, leſt he ſhould turn his Back to the Princeſs, went
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62815:51"/>
backward, ſtopping and bowing two or three times. By
chance it happen'd, that after he had bow'd a ſecond time,
ſtill retreating backward, his <hi>Periwig caught hold of a Branch
that hung in the room,</hi> which either he had not ſeen, or elſe
had forgot, and pulling it off diſcover'd his Bald Head. The
<hi>Embaſſadour</hi> bluſh'd, and the Ladys and Maids of Honour
could not forbear Laughing; onely the Princeſs did not ſo
much as ſmile but kept her Countenance with the ſame Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
as when ſhe heard the Embaſſadour's Addreſs. After the
Embaſſadour was gone, one of the Ladys who was greatly
in her favour, admiring the <hi>Reſervedneſs of the Princeſs</hi> upon
ſuch a Jocular accident, made bold to ask her, how ſhe could
hold laughing? To whom the Princeſs, <hi>I ſhould have done
the Embaſſadour an Injury, ſaid ſhe, ſhould I by an unſeaſonable
fit of Laughter, added to the ſhame and trouble of a Perſon who
was in Confuſion and Perplexity enough at what had unhappily,
and through no fault of his befall'n him: No, Madam, that
had been ill done, and againſt my Duty.</hi> With this Serenity
of Aſpect, and ſweetneſs of her Countenance all people who
were admitted to the Queen were ſo mov'd, that they could
not think they beheld a Queen, but ſome certain <hi>Goddeſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent
and propitious to mankind. A ſingular Gravity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
this Divine Goodneſs, after a wonderful manner
intermixing Majeſty and Familiarity together: Add to this,
the <hi>Graces of her Countenance,</hi> the Serenity of her Aſpect, the
Sparkling and Chearfulneſs of her Eyes, and indeed the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of her whole Body. No body could behold her who
was not ſtrook with ſo many Excellencies. No wonder
then that ſo many Ornaments both of Body and Mind,
ſhould beget ſo much Love and Admiration, and love in the
minds of all People, in ſo much that ſhe was belov'd, and
worſhipt like a Goddeſs ſent down from Heaven to enlighten
this Age, and procure the ſafety of ſo many People, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
after her Death deſir'd and bewail'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62815:52"/>
Now as ſhe was always like her ſelf, through the whole
Courſe of her Life, ſo neither did ſhe <hi>ſwerve from her ſelf</hi> at
her death. The manner of her moſt pious and conſtant
End, apparently anſwer'd, the moſt Holy Purpoſe of her
whole Life. As againſt all other fears, ſo againſt the moſt terrible
of all Terrours her Courage was Invincible, neither the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Diſeaſe, nor the unlucky approach of Death in the
<hi>Flouriſh of her Age,</hi> in the midſt of ſo many ſoothing Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of this Life, could prevail with the Queen, to ſhew the
leaſt ſign of ſadneſs. On the other ſide, when ſhe heard and
was ſenſible of being call'd away, many and moſt Illuſtrious
were the ſigns of her undaunted departing from this Station
of Life. When the Right Reverend Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
ſent for ſome few days before ſhe expir'd, gave her
to underſtand the certain <hi>Approach of Death,</hi> that ſhe was to
prepare for the Journey which all Mortals early or later are
to take, placidly, without any ſign of a ſick Mind, though
extreamly weakned in Body by the Force of the Diſeaſe, ſhe
made Anſwer, <hi>That that was not the firſt Day of her Learning
to prepare for Death; for that ſhe had ſerv'd God during the
whole Courſe of her Life.</hi> A ſaying truly worthy of ſo great
a Queen, worthy the Remembrance of all <hi>Ages.</hi> She had
learnt, that then we begin to live when we die. We die as
ſoon as born; every day ſomething is imperceptibly cropt
from our Lives, till by degrees the whole be lopt away. And
that this moſt pious Queen neither deceiv'd her ſelf, nor the
Archbiſhop, is apparent from that memorable ſaying of hers
about ſix years before her fatal day, when <hi>ſhe ſate by the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of a Noble Perſon's Wife,</hi> whom ſhe highly Lov'd, and
valued, to confirm and comfort her, then drawing her laſt
breath. They who were preſent deſir'd her, that ſhe would
turn away her Eyes from the Expiring Lady. But the
Queen refus'd, ſaying withal, <hi>That it rarely fell out for Perſons
of her Rank and Quality to ſee ſuch a Spectacle as now was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62815:52"/>
her by the deſign'd Favour of Heaven, to make Advantage of
it in better underſtanding the Vanity of our Life.</hi> What Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
ſhe made of it, the concluſion of her Days ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
taught us. After this ſhe fed her Soul with the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Food of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, with a deep
ſence of the Pains which our Redeemer Suffered for us. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
with this Sacred Banquet, ſhe caſt away all Further
Care of Earthly Affairs, that ſhe might think upon nothing
elſe but of Enjoying God, when freed from her Corporeal
Impriſonment; that God, whom upon Earth ſhe had ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
lov'd, and ſo purely Worſhipt. She bid the King
farewel in theſe words, which are utter'd by me in Latin; for
you do not hear what ſhe could ſay, but what ſhe ſaid; <hi>I leave
the Earth: I hope, dear King, you never miſtruſted my Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Love. Moderate your Grief. I wiſh that with the
ſame Joy that I depart, with the ſame eaſineſs you may ſet bounds
to your ſorrow.</hi> Soon after the Divine MARY expir'd in the
Hands and Embraces of the King, who never left her, nor
ſtir'd out of her Chamber Day or Night, whilſt ſhe lay labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
under three moſt cruel Diſeaſes, the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> an <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
and a <hi>Peſtilential Fever,</hi> either of which was enough to
have carried off the ſtrongeſt of Men.</p>
                  <p>'Tis better to paſs over in ſilence the <hi>Grief</hi> that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
the King, than to ſpend time and words in vain.
For words cannot be found, that can in any meaſure expreſs
the Vaſtneſs of his Grief. Such was always, and ſo great
the Reſolution of the moſt Couragious King, and ſuch his
Fortitude, that tho aſſail'd with Angry fortune's utmoſt Fury,
he never could be mov'd, never ſuccumb'd, but bore his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
with an Elevated mind. Never any Man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
were the madneſs of Raging Diſaſter, could perceive
any change of Countenance in the King. But this ſame
Grief he was not able to withſtand, <hi>Vanquiſh'd by the Force
of his Love and Loſs;</hi> as having loſt the moſt certain and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62815:53"/>
faithful Componion of his Fortune, of his Counſels, his
Cares, his Labours, and his Thoughts; who far exceeded
all the Excellencies of the Female Sex, that hardly the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of any Woman, in any Age, can be compar'd to hers.
For that reaſon perhaps it was that Heaven deny'd her Off-ſpring,
leſt ſhe ſhould <hi>bring forth a worſe than her ſelf and her
Husband, ſeeing Nature could go no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No wonder then that Invincible Reſolution, that undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet ſedate Courage of <hi>William,</hi> in all the Rudeſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts
of this Life, was ſo deeply ſtruck and ſhaken with this
Thunder-Bolt. For he now miſſes the only Beſt and Wiſeſt
of Queens, when he moſt needed her, and might have reap'd
infinite Advantages from her Fidelity, Prudence and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in Governing wiſely at Home, while he perform'd
Wonders abroad. There is no man ſo Iron-hearted, but muſt
be ſenſible of the Extremity of Pain, when the <hi>One half of his
Soul</hi> is ſever'd from him, by ſo violent a ſtroke.</p>
                  <p>However, we doubt not, but the King, out of his incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Wiſdom, tho his Grief can never be exhauſted, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
himſelf, and re-call his Mind from the Bitterneſs of
his Grief; to accompliſh what he has ſo proſperouſly begun,
that Work, which turns the Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> upon him,
on whom the Fate of it depends: To the End that by his
Conduct and Counſel, Eaſe, Tranquility and Security may
be reſtord to ſo fair a Portion of the Habitable World; and
Peace ſo ſettl'd, that not only Arms may be laid down, but
with thoſe Arms all fear of taking 'em up again.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as all men unmeaſurably Grieve for the Death
of the Queen, as being a Wound by which all ſuffer; ſo now
again all Pray for the Safety and Preſervation of the King;
all, who are concern'd for the ſafety and liberty of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary</hi> was; <hi>The Flower of Queens was once; the Ornament
of the Age, the Love of the People, the Delight of the World,
the Granary of the Poor, the Altar of the miſerable.</hi> Thou,
beſt and Greateſt of Queens haſt loſt nothing, who Reapeſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62815:53"/>
now Eternal Beatitude, the Fruit of a Life ſo Piouſly, ſo
Chaſtly, ſo Prudently Led, exempt from all the Cares and
Troubles wherewith we miſerable Wretches are toſs'd by
Storms and Waves of theſe wicked times.</p>
                  <p>The King has loſt the Alleviation of his Cares, the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the People in Proſperity, their Aid in Adverſity; and
all good Men their main Tower of Defence.</p>
                  <p>Thou Departedſt this Life in the <hi>Flower of thy Age;</hi> but
what remorſeleſs Death has abſtracted from the Number of
thy Years, men will add as much and more to the Eternal
Glory, Fame and Remembrance of thy Name. That was
not to be ſaid thy Life which thou ledſt in the Chains of
thy Mortal Body; but is to be call'd thy Life which thou
art to Live, immortal in the Hearts and Minds of all People,
who will always burn with Love and Admiration of thy
Vertues. Thou haſt no reaſon to grieve, that thou didſt not
bleſs the King with Off-ſpring, the only thing which many
thought was wanting to compleat thy happineſs of Earth;
and which indeed is a more than ordinary Grief, both to the
King and us. For as of old, when <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was upbraided
with want of Iſſue, he boaſted, that he left a Daughter behind
him, meaning the Battle of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> which would not only
ſurvive him, but be Immortal; ſo thou, moſt Bleſſed MARY,
the Mother of ſo many Kingdoms and People, the Mother
of the Oppreſſed, the Mother of the Poor and Needy, wilt
leave behind thee ſo many Daughters that will never Dye,
the Eternal Encomiums and Sempiternal Glory of thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Beneficence, Charity, Clemency, Mildneſs, and the
reſt of thy other moſt lovely Vertues, which will live im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
in the Remembrance of all Poſterity. This Life will
prolong thy <hi>Conſecrated Memory</hi> to after Ages. Nor Marble
<hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> nor Golden <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> ſhall hide thee; <hi>Thy Tomb ſhall
be our Breaſts.</hi>

intermix'd with <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Sobs,</hi> among

Power of Human Utterance to do, tho every particular
Member of the Body were turn'd into Tongues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded

in which one word all things are comprehended: Not in the

always call'd the <hi>Laſt the Beſt:</hi> Nor as <hi>Nero</hi> ſtil'd his <hi>Poppaea,</hi>
the <hi>Genius of the City,</hi> which was the Sirname of the Beſt
Emperors; but She is gone, who, by the General Voice of
all People, ſo deſerv'd the Appellation of <hi>BEST,</hi> that while
it remains the allow'd Glory of Kings and Queens in this

Conſent</hi> of Mankind. The moſt Splendid, and moſt
Benign Conſtellation (if ever any other enlightn'd and ſhed
down its Influences upon Earth) of <hi>Britain</hi> is ſet; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation
of the United <hi>Belgian States</hi> is ſet, but in an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Gloomy Night, only now to refreſh both Nations
with the ſole ſhadow of her Name. <hi>MARY is ſet,</hi> like
that Star which cauſes the viciſſitudes of Day and Night,
returning from whence firſt of all She roſe. And in this
Common, tho far different loſs of all men, <hi>WILLIAM</hi>
bewails more than the one Half of his Soul: <hi>The Court,</hi> as
it were grown decrepit with Age, bewails their Delight:
The <hi>Kingdoms</hi> bewail an Empreſs hardly ſhewn to 'em, yet
Greater than the Narrow Limits of Kingdoms or an Age could
contain: The <hi>Subjects</hi> bewail their moſt Indulgent Mother,
more truly then formerly <hi>Livia</hi> or <hi>Julia</hi> the Pious, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Country, the <hi>Senate</hi> and the Armies: <hi>Holland</hi>
bewails her Foſter-Child, as it were raviſh'd and torn from
her tender Boſom, wherein ſhe had continually cheriſh'd
Her, even divided from the whole World beſide. The <hi>Female
Sex</hi> now miſſes. Her that was their Luſtre, their Excellency,

They that were ſtript of all their Fortunes, their Liberal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:
The <hi>Miſerable,</hi> the Aſſwager of their Calamities:
The <hi>Oppreſs'd,</hi> their certain Conſolation; The <hi>Baniſh'd,</hi> their
not to be violated Sanctuary: The <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> their <hi>Irene</hi>
truly ſo call'd: Laſtly, <hi>All Ages, all Orders, all Nations,</hi> who
ever they are that in the higheſt Station of Human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
reverence Vertue and Piety, miſs their <hi>moſt Sacred, and
moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Head.</hi> And who among us is not deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and pierced to the Heart, in beholding the Mournful ſight
of one ſingle <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> that moſt invincible Hero, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
ſome One of thoſe moſt Valiant Captains, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppreſt by ſome <hi>ſudden Aſtoniſhment,</hi> ſtand Speechleſs for
a while; at leaſt bewailing the Companion of his <hi>Counſels and
his Labours,</hi> his Delights and Royal Functions ſnatch'd from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62815:57"/>
an unexpected Fate? Of that <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> who was never
puft up with <hi>Proſperity,</hi> nor broken by Adverſity, who
terrifi'd by no dangers, nor diſmaid at any Terrible Accident;
as if his <hi>Breaſt were environ'd with a Threefold Corſlet of Braſs,</hi>
or that he carry'd not an Iron but an Adamantine Heart;
now wounded beyond the Aid of Cure, cannot refrain from
Tears and Throbs; as not being wounded or pierced
through by any Bullet of his Enemy, but by a Force ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Human, God Himſelf (which befel the moſt Holy Men)
thus wreſtling with our Hero in a Dark and Bitter Night,
till at length the Supream Creator of all things rent <hi>away the
Rib</hi> that ſtuck to his Royal Side; not when he was aſleep,
as in that Fabrick of <hi>Eve,</hi> but when he was awake and
watching o're the Publick Safety. And this was a Pain,
which the Firſt of Husbands, in Primitive Felicity was not
able cope with. Yet does he not ſink under ſo much Grief;
nor does the Greateſt of Hero's refuſe to ſubmit his Equal
Courage to the Arbiter of Life and Death ſo cruelly afflicting
his <hi>Royal Bowels.</hi> So neither would it become us, who ought,
in imitation of ſo Great a King, to lift up our ſelves to him
by whom all Human Affairs are govern'd with a Nod, this
ſad and unfortunate Day, to ſolemnize the Royal Exequies
with Female Lamentations or the hir'd Howlings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Praeſicae,</hi> which the Law of the Twelve Tables forbid
the Roman Matrons, or to fill the Market, Public Streets, the
Temples and Tribunals with hideous Clamours. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Breaſts</hi> diſtended with vain Sighs, nor <hi>Countenances</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſadneſs, nor the warm ſtreams of Tears ſtill guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from our Eyes, will afford any alleviation to our afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Minds; theſe being many times vain Shews and Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sorrow, which the Bitterneſs and Solemnity of our
Preſent Calamity abhors above what it is poſſible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
<hi>What then?</hi> Shall we ſuppreſs and hide our Grief, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
we turn into <hi>Noibe's</hi> and Stones; ſhall we make known
our deeply conceiv'd Sorrow to our Fellow Citizens, to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62815:57"/>
People, to ſucceeding Poſterity by no Demonſtrations of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by no long laſting Monument? For <hi>Rome,</hi> the Miſtreſs
of the World decreed to the Women in High Stations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their deceaſes, no leſs then to the Soveaign Emperors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Divine Honours, and the Vows of Sacrilegious Piety,
Funeral Encomiums alſo, ſuch as were made with Solemn
Pomp, and in publick Commemoration of their Vertue; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s <hi>Livia, Nero</hi>'s <hi>Poppaea, Hadrian</hi>'s <hi>Sabina, Antoninus
Pius</hi>'s <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi>'s <hi>Julia Domna.</hi> But for the moſt part
theſe things were ſo carried by the controul of thoſe that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd,
or according to the prevailing Manners of a looſe
Court and a diſſolute People, that the Diſhonours and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
of their Sex were Conſecrated to Immortality under
the Names <hi>Juno's, Venus's and Mothers of the Gods.</hi> With
the ſame Confidence and Luſt of Flattery, did the Princes
that ſucceeded extol the <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>Praiſe:</hi> The Tables tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Eternity the Clemency and Moderation of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
the Prudence of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the Patience of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> the Noble Acts of <hi>Commodus,</hi> as if
they had been born to eternize the Roman Name. <hi>Oh!
how different is the Reaſon of this Days moſt Religious Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
by which the whole World is made a Witneſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavian</hi>
Piety! How far different are thefe Parentals, truly
Juſt, the ſign of Love and Judgment, which the <hi>Fathers of
this Republick and Academy</hi> have by a Solemn Decree, and
with redoubl'd Honour, decree'd to <hi>MARY</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST.</hi>
Imitating the Piety of <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> who aſcribed that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to his Siſter <hi>Octavia,</hi> a Renowned Woman, that the
Emperor himſelf, in the <hi>Julian</hi> Temple, and <hi>Druſus</hi> in the
Publick Place of Judicature, in Mourning Veſtments deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
themſelves in Praiſe of the Deceas'd. How far that
Commendation of this Queen is from Idolatry, moſt <hi>Noble
Auditors,</hi> or from whatever vain Ambition is uſually wont
fallaciouſly to forge, I leave to you; the Commendation of
a Queen, whoſe Divine Genius, Pure and Chaſt Vertue and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62815:58"/>
Immortal Glory, all People, Subjects and Confederates, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks
and Foraigners, they who reverence Vertue in an
Enemy, with equal conſent of Mind and Voice, admire and
extol to the Skies. Nay, the <hi>Fucus's</hi> of Flatteries, and all
criſp'd and curl'd Orations would as much diſhonour Her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>MANES,</hi> as not only the Bitterneſs of our Sorrow
forbids the practice of ſuch Deluſions, in commanding us to
lay aſide all <hi>Gaiety of Ornament,</hi> but She Herſelf, who when
alive and breathing, but ſparingly admitted moderate Praiſes;
and not only expell'd from her Royal Preſence all <hi>Adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Beauties,</hi> all Diſſimulation and Sycophantizing Language,
all Feigned Acclamations, the very <hi>Peſts of the Court</hi> and
Mothers of <hi>Nero,</hi> but was always wont to call 'em the
<hi>Affronts of Majeſty.</hi> For my part, <hi>Fathers, Collegiates, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
and <hi>Strangers,</hi> in this condition of my dejected Mind,
I ſhall be ſo far from all <hi>Aſſentation,</hi> or ſuſpicion of Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Praiſe as my Oration is diſtant from neceſſity. And
if I have take upon me this day the Task of paying a Laſt
Duty to the <hi>IMMORTAL WOMAN,</hi> believe it done
not out of any confidence of Performance, nor any profuſe
Oſtentation of Piety, but meerly out of Shame to refuſe; for
the truth of which I appeal to thoſe that ſit at the <hi>Helm of
our Affairs.</hi> But when I revolve in my mind, that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon occaſions of Important and Publick Mourning,
<hi>Kings themſelves took this Office upon 'em, David</hi> of Old, and
ſince him, Perſons of Conſular Dignity, from <hi>Valerius Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licola,</hi>
ſometimes the <hi>Caeſars</hi> or Princes of the Roman
Youth, when <hi>Julius, Auguſtus, Tiberius, Druſus, Caligula,
Nero</hi> aſcended the Tribunal, to Commemorate diſhonour'd
Vertue with that Majeſty of Countenance that became it.
When I am in the midſt of ſilent Contemplation to renew
Reflexions upon this Auguſt Queen, of <hi>whom nothing Low,
nothing Mortal ought to be ſaid; Octavianus Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
refuſing the Panegyricks of any but the Sublimeſt of
Wits: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When I behold All you that with Anxious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62815:58"/>
and Wiſtful Looks ſurround this Pulpit, nothing from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſents it ſelf to my Eyes, nothing to my Mind and
Affections, but what is ſufficient to caſt down a <hi>Perſon worn
with years,</hi> and almoſt ſpent with Labour, but moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
languiſhing with the Publick Sorrow, and to deter him
from ſpeaking. Therefore in ſo much plenty of Matter, I ſhall
ſhorten this <hi>Funeral Encomium</hi> of mine, from which the
ſtrictneſs of going according to the Laws of Panegyric is not
to be exacted; ſuch a one as the Father of Grecian Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
was longer Elaborating then the Macedonian Victor
was ſubduing almoſt all the World: And in kindneſs to your
Patience and my own Infirmities, I ſhall leave it to <hi>Maſters
of Art,</hi> Men of Florid Age and Elocution, to expatiate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what I have contracted, beſeeching your Pardon at the
beginning, if my Abilities prove not equal to the Majeſty of
a moſt Auguſt Princeſs, or the Bitterneſs of my Anguiſh.</p>
                  <p>How Bright ſoever be that Star, which ſometimes ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
into Horns, ſometimes with a <hi>Half Face,</hi> at length
with a full Orb, in ſome meaſure, ſupplies and mitigates the
Abſence of the Sun, it ſhines not however with its own
Light, but borrows all its ſplendor from the Aſpect and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the Sun. In like manner the World has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
beheld <hi>Illuſtrious and far ſhining Women,</hi> but that I
may ſpeak in the Words of one <hi>Septimius,</hi> they have more
truly glitter'd with the Decorations of their Husbands then
their own: Much of Light and Splendor ſince Her Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the Preſent Sun of the European World has been
added to our Heroeſs, from the Reflexions of his Beams.
However She <hi>ſhone with Her own,</hi> and Her ownmoſt Radiant
Light, and made it doubtful, which way She from Her ſelf
diffus'd the ſereneſt Light, whether by her Royal Deſcent,
or by weilding the Royal Scepter, Her ſelf in her own Right
<hi>Aſſociate</hi> of the Empire, or laſtly by Her Royal Vertues
and Graces, conſpicuous through all the Regions of the
Earth.

Macedonian <hi>Amyntas</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi> from <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
<hi>Alexander</hi> from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Julian Pedegree from
<hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> into which the Wife of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> by the
Name of the Goddeſs <hi>Julia</hi> is to be inſerted. How much
more true and ſacred, without offence to theſe Deities, was
the Original of this <hi>PRINCESS,</hi> who underſtood Her
ſelf to be not only the <hi>Progenie of the</hi> Stuarts, <hi>from</hi> Robert
<hi>the Second,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Happy,</hi> and three Ages lower, but
from a more Ancient Original of the <hi>Royal Race in Scotland,</hi>
not to deſcend into the dubious Succeſſion of <hi>Hector Boetius:</hi>
Then from the <hi>Anglo-Saxons,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Margaret</hi>
to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Second. From the <hi>Norman,</hi> by the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> VII, and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Wife
of <hi>James</hi> IV. From the <hi>Danes,</hi> by <hi>Ann</hi> Her Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.
Laſtly from the <hi>Blood of France,</hi> by Her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother,
<hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the no leſs Unfortunate Mother
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62815:59"/>
of the unfortunate <hi>James.</hi> So that to what ever corner
of the Heaven our Heroeſs turn'd Her Eyes, ſhe certainly
ſaw her Anceſtors Cloath with Royal Dignity.</p>
                  <p>But tho ſhe were deſcended from ſuch a <hi>Progeny of Kings</hi>
(and would to God ſhe had been the <hi>Mother of Kings)</hi> Since
Women born, there never was any like her, who as it were
forgetful of her Extraction, of her Anceſtors, and the Power
derived from Antiquity, which many believe to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to authorize their Tranſgreſſion, who carried her ſelf
more humbly to all Fortunes, Degrees and Conditions of
Men, even to the pooreſt ſort, negligent of her Station
and that Towring Throne, from whence with her Great
<hi>WILLIAM</hi> ſhe gave Laws to ſo many ſpacious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
ſo many Seas, Iſlands and People. <hi>MARY,</hi> in that
ſame High Degree of Dignity would not be thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Scepters of her Anceſtors, nor the Glory of
her Progenitors, nor her own proper Lot to Command and
Reign. She bore in mind, that <hi>High and Low were in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the ſame Law of ſaving and coming into the World;</hi>
tho the ſame Fortune and Splendor did not attend all alike,
yet all were of the ſame Mould, they who are cloathed
with Imperial Purple, and they who are forc'd to ſhroud
themſelves under the meaneſt Cottages: Which was the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that there was no difference between <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,
nobly deſcended, and the moſt Obſcure Porter:</hi> She well
knew, that Long deſcent and Ancient Lineage, were but
vain ſhadows; that the Blood which is ſprightly and ruddy
in Youth, grows languid and degenerates with Age; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the Beams of the moſt Splendid Light diffuſe
themſelves upon Common-ſewers: That is to ſay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Julia's</hi> and <hi>Agrippina's,</hi> upon <hi>Caligula's</hi> and <hi>Nero's,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Domitian's</hi> and <hi>Nero's,</hi> born to be the Inſamy of their
Families; rather Excrements then Blood. Whence it came
to paſs, that they rather choſe to be accounted the Heads
and founders of their Race and Name, then that it ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62815:60"/>
be thought the Glory of their Anceſtors extinguiſhed in
them.</p>
                  <p>I remember, <hi>Noble Hearers,</hi> the one day that this Pious
and Penſive Princeſs recalling to Mind her <hi>Father,</hi> who had
ſo lately rul'd moſt flouriſhing Kingdoms, but gone aſtray
from that Faith which the Laws of God and Man had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, the <hi>Joſiah</hi> of his
Age, and which his Father and Grandfather had ſubſcrib'd
to; I remember, I ſay, that being admitted into her <hi>Private
Chappel,</hi> after ſhe had let fall a ſhowre of Tears, ſhe gave
thanks to God, the Supream Parent of all things, <hi>who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
forſook the Sons and Grand-children of Hero's, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in them ſupply'd what was wanting in their Parents, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the Vice of Nature by the Benefit of Grace.</hi> Which
when I had confirmed by the Examples of her ſelf, and
her Great Grandfather <hi>James</hi> the Son of Unfortunate <hi>Mary;</hi>
and that it was done by the ſame Miracle of Grace, as we
daily ſee Nature produce Gold and Diamonds out of ſtony
and craggy Mountains, and Sweet Juices out of Bitter Roots,
I added by way of Conſolation of her <hi>Afflicted Piety,</hi> that
perhaps the <hi>Father of ſo many Tears aud Sighs</hi> would not be
loſt in Heaven. Whoſe chiefeſt Glory it was to have begot
<hi>MARY;</hi> and from whom ſhe received her Being, while he
on the other ſide receiv'd from his Daughter the benefit and
aid of her Prayers, then which there is nothing of greater
force to <hi>expugn</hi> the Clemency of Heaven; and a uſeful Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of Grace, which ſhe every day ſet before his Eyes.
And indeed whatever there was of Great that rais'd our
Heroeſs above all the Queens of all Former Ages, whatever
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> almoſt ador'd in her, what the <hi>Batavian</hi> lov'd,
the <hi>German</hi> honour'd, the <hi>Switzer</hi> reverenc'd, and the girning
and reluctant <hi>French</hi> admir'd, Fame has alſo ſo loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
to the utmoſt Limits of the <hi>Hyperborean, Eaſtern</hi>
and <hi>Weſtern</hi> World, that ſhe can never be ſaid to have ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
the fame of any other Woman, as ſhe has ſounded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62815:60"/>
forth in Praiſe of this Princeſs. And all this we muſt certainly
conclude was ne're infus'd into her by any Human, but by a
Divine, an Immortal Operation.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place that moſt Sweet and Holy Name of
<hi>MARY,</hi> conſecrated from the very Birth of Grace it ſelf,
was a moſt Auſpicious Augury of the Future Salvation,
Reſtoration and Security of <hi>Britain.</hi> And it was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
in Ours as it was Ominous and Fatal in <hi>Four Former
MARYS of England, Scotland, France,</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Italy,</hi>
whoſe Fame, Religion trampl'd under foot, the Sacred Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God prophan'd, Laws violated, Halters, Slaughter-Houſes,
Racks, Funeral Piles and Flaming Buſts, and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Church it ſelf upon the brink of Ruin, and groaning
under moſt oppreſſive Servitude proclaim far and near. In
like manner as the mournful Annals of the Church declare
both the Subſtance and the Omen to have fail'd, under for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chriſtian Governments in the <hi>Fauſta's, Eudoxia's, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria's,
Euſebias, Theodora's, Irene's;</hi> Specious indeed but
empty Names of Chriſtian Queens in former Ages. And
therefore <hi>Britain</hi> that had been ruin'd by <hi>MARIES,</hi> was at
length to be preſerved by a <hi>Mary;</hi> and as it was of old, by
many ways afflicted by two <hi>William's</hi> Firſt and Second, ſo
it receiv'd New Life and Spirit from <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the
THIRD. On the other ſide, by a contrary Example, in
the Name of <hi>James</hi> the Second, as in the fatal Names of
<hi>Darius, Philip, Antiochus, Ariſtobulus, Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
we ſee the unfortunate Cataſtrophe of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
under the ſame Names with joyful and lucky Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices.</p>
                  <p>But above all things, who among ye can forbear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Conduct of the Supream Architect, who fram'd
this <hi>wonderful Structure</hi> at the Beginning, without the Aid
or Knowledge of the Sleeping Parent of Mankind, when this
<hi>Goodly Form,</hi> this Pulchritude and Procerity of Female Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
repreſents it ſelf before your Eyes, not Heroe like, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62815:61"/>
almoſt Divine; ſuch a Majeſtic Forehead, ſuch a Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Countenance, ſuch <hi>Radiant Eyes,</hi> ſuch an Harmony of
Shape and Lineaments, accompany'd with Sweetneſs of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and a Charming Aſpect in our <hi>MARY,</hi> ſurpaſſing
all the Graces and <hi>Venus's</hi> of the <hi>Greek,</hi> tho enliven'd with
<hi>Apellaean</hi> Colours. Deſerving indeed not only more then
Mortal Empire, which the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> decreed to Majeſty of
Form, but alſo of Eternity of Reign, if any ſuch thing
might be granted upon Earth. Her Coeleſtial Courage, her
Lofty Mind, Her Wit that penetrated the moſt hidden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
Her Judgment certain and unacquainted with Miſtake,
Her inexhauſtible Thirſt of Reading, the incredible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Her Memory, Her Heroick Genius, all theſe were
depoſited in a Royal Domicil or rather Temple, rear'd by
the ſame Architect as the Univerſe. There was eminently
to be ſeen in her Words, in her Aſpect, in her Habit, in
her Eyes, in the Poſture and Carriage of her Body, unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Sincerity, Fidelity, Candor, and whatever elſe could
procure Love and Reverence. Beſides the Gracefulneſs of
her Delivery, the Accompliſh'd underſtanding of three Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and her Knowledge of things Divine and Human,
ſhe was adorn'd to perfection with harmleſs and Chaſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which no Impurities could defile, no envenom'd Breath,
no Peſtiferous Gales, the Familiar Contagion of Courts,
could ever infect. Her pure and ſpotleſs Mind might rather
be broken, like Chryſtal Glaſſes crackt by the Infuſion of
Poyſon, then endure what was not accompany'd with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Honeſty, or ſome publick or private benefit. So
that whatever moſt uſually puffs up with Arrogance, or
corrupts with Stomachful Pride, a Sex moſt covetous of Rule:
What makes others ſwell and look down upon their Inferiors
with Contempt, as Nobility of Extraction, Beauty, Wit and
Wealth, like Boxes glittering without with Gold and Gems,
but within incloſing Arſenick, ſuch as have more of Aloes then
Honey, all theſe Blemiſhes of her Sex, ſhe was a Princeſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62815:61"/>
who from her Infancy deteſted. So that ſhe whom the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Parent of Nature had rendred every way perfect and
fortunate, bewailing only this one thing, that ſhe was better
then her Father; ſhe, when but a Child, was never obſerv'd
to ſwell, or abate of her uſual Affability, Mildneſs, Eaſineſs to
give admiſſion, or of the humble Opinion ſhe had always of
her ſelf. And as much as there was in her Countenance of
ingenuous and Royal Erubeſcency, ſo much was there in her
Heart, of Baſhful Modeſty; by which means Majeſty was
always ſeaſon'd with Benignity, Gravity with Cheerfulneſs,
Clemency with Severity. And as many as were admitted
to the Preſence and Ear of ſo Great a Princeſs, knew they
were to undergo a perpetual combat with her Modeſty, ſo
that they muſt be forc'd to ſubmit their diſcourſes to this
ſame Modeſty, or elſe to be ſilent altogether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſcript Fathers,</hi> I ſpeak thoſe things which are vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, chiefly aiming at this, that no man ſhould believe, ſo
many and ſuch great Endowments of Mind were tranſmitted
into <hi>MARY</hi> with the Blood of the Father and Mother;
which were the only Workmanſhip of God, who would
only vouchſafe by this to ſhew how far he could accompliſh
Nature, and this I boldly and confidently aver. For in the
moſt Corrupt times of King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>'s Courts,
when Popery adventured not only to creep in privately,
but pulling off her Vizor, to ruſh in with open force; when
Religion was a Cloak for Fraudulent Artifices; when Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Arts, Diſſolute Clemency, Undecent Practices and
Wanton Paſtimes were the Delights of the Court, and Flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Youth was led away by the Princes as they pleaſed
themſelves; it came to paſs, not without the Aſſiſtance of
God himſelf, that all this while <hi>MARY</hi> and <hi>ANN,</hi> under
the tuition of Noble Matrons, and other Exquiſite and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inſtructors, as formerly the two Siſters <hi>Pulcheria</hi> and
<hi>Arcadia</hi> the Daughters of <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> by the Order of <hi>Charles</hi> II.
were kept to a ſtrict Diſcipline. By whom the Minds of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62815:62"/>
the Royal Virgins, that were one day to be advanced to
Sovereign Dignity, might be rightly form'd, and excited
not ſo much to the Deſires of a Pompous and Illuſtrious
Fortune, as to the Study of true Piety, and a Religion
purg'd from Superſtition. Thus Nature has taught us, that
<hi>Parian</hi> Marbles are to be cut ſmooth, Ivory plain'd, and
Diamonds poliſh'd; that Gold is to be purifi'd, Plants and
Trees to be trim'd and lopt, and the choiceſt Seeds to be
improv'd by Art, when no Induſtry can Correct or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the Pumice, the Tophus and Spung. Theſe being
then the firſt Initiations of both Princeſſes, the moſt prudent
<hi>Henry,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> being afterwards to improve the
Inherent Promptitude of Nature, and the management of
their Infancy, our <hi>MARY</hi> by degrees, having already
made her choice, ſo accuſtom'd her ſelf to reading and
hearing at the Feet of Jeſus, which ſhe waſh'd with the
daily and moſt fragrant Perfumes of her Prayers, Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Vows, that afterwards ſhe valu'd all other things
as little worth, look'd upon 'em as Empty Vanities, and
an Imaginary Shadow of Glory, and ceas'd thenceforward
to admire,
<q>
                        <l>Aulae Fumum &amp; Opes, ſtrepitumque:</l>
                        <l>The Smoak, the Riches and Noiſe</l>
                     </q>
of the Court, and whatever Ambitious Minds hunt
after, without the Pale of Heavenly Contemplation, like
the Crow flying about the Empty World out of the
Ark of <hi>Noah.</hi> I will report a known Truth. When
firſt the News was brought of the Inauſpicious, but
certain Nuptials of <hi>James</hi> the Father, with <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi>
by the Mediation of <hi>LEWIS,</hi> not only ſhe, toge|
with <hi>ANN</hi> her Siſter, with a Caſt-down Countenance
and Watry Eyes receiv'd the Tidings, attended with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62815:62"/>
of Tears, which Doctor <hi>Thomas Doughty,</hi> then Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic
Chaplain, could by no means put a ſtop to, but our
<hi>MARY</hi> alſo after ſhe ſomewhat alleviated her Sorrow
with Weeping, brake forth into theſe Expreſſions, worthy
to be engrav'd in Cedar. <hi>However things fall out,</hi> ſaid ſhe
<hi>I hope we ſhall preſerve immaculate to God our Faith and our
Religion,</hi> let all other things paſs away, <hi>which we ſhall look
upon as of little conſequence.</hi> What certain preſages were
theſe, Moſt Noble Hearers, that the <hi>HEPOESS,</hi> whom
we bewail, would one day be the moſt inexpugnable Tower
and ſolid Bulwark of the more Holy Religion, and a moſt
perfect Exemplar of thoſe Vertues, which would render
her the Immortal Deſire both of us and our Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>But from theſe Exerciſes of her Youth, ſhe was called to
Greater and Higher Things, and to lay the Foundations of
Empire and Council, under the Conduct of <hi>WILLIAM
HENRY:</hi> And what a Name was that! This was he to
whom the Divine Wand, and that Mortal pointing out the
way, mark'd out <hi>MARY</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> ſhe that was only to
kindle his Flame; She that among all Women was the only
Perſon fit for his Choice, to be the Glory and Ornament of
his Conjugal Life, and ſuch a One as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſought, but
could not find among thouſands. As He alone among all the
Hero's and Princes, truly Chriſtian, was brightly Eminent
and fit for <hi>MARY'S</hi> Wiſh to be the Conductor of her
Youth and Life: As in whom there was a Concurrence of all
Praiſes and Univerſal Glory: As in whom alone all thoſe
Great Things met, divided of Old in the Perſons of the
four <hi>Ephori</hi> that were to inſtruct the <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes, ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Government of the Empire; of which, the Firſt
to infuſe Religion; the Second, to govern the Affections;
the Third, to inſpire Fortitude of Mind; and the Fourth, to
infuſe Love of Juſtice into thoſe that were to Reign. And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62815:63"/>
                     <hi>MARY</hi> ſo deeply imprinted in her Mind the Image of
this Great Maſter, and her Mind being capable of Great
Things, beyond her Sex, ſhe profited ſo well, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ſo Great a Prince, not only by his Inſtructions,
but by his Example, that ſhe was taught to Reign before
ſhe could know her ſelf. I will faithfully relate what I
only heard my ſelf, and therefore can atteſt. While ſhe
ſtaid at the <hi>Hague,</hi> after the Expedition for <hi>England,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Wind, I was admitted to the Preſence of the Royal
Princeſs, and found her turmoil'd with many Cares and
deep Cogitations. At what time ſhe, who was never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any meaſure of Familiarity, caſting a Propitious
Look upon the <hi>Interpreters of the Holy Bible,</hi> deliver'd her
ſelf in theſe Expreſſions to me.</p>
                  <p>What a Severe and Cruel Neceſſity, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> now lies upon
me, either to forſake a Father, whom my Grandmother firſt
ruin'd, <hi>(hence</hi> France <hi>the Author of our Parents Calamity,)</hi>
or to forſake a Husband, my Country, nay God himſelf, and
my Soul, my Neareſt and my Deareſt Pledge.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a Cruel Neceſſity indeed, Madam, anſwer'd I, but
not to be avoided; Heaven not enduring divided Duty, nor
divided Affections; Heaven, that has not only joyn'd you
by an Eternal Tie to <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> but calls you to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
your Labouring if not Periſhing Country, the Church
of God, your Religion, and theſe your <hi>Batavians,</hi> over
whoſe Necks the Sword or Bondage hang. You forſake a
Father, Madam, 'tis true, but who firſt forſook Himſelf,
Nature, his Children, Kingdoms, Religion, Laws, his
Word, and the Hopes of his Subjects; who departed himſelf
from the Government, that he might ſerve the Conveniences
of thoſe, who under the pretence of Falſe Religions, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
all things Divine and Human by their own Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62815:63"/>
And when I added, that ſhe was called by the Voice
of Heaven from a moſt delightful Eaſe, to be the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>WILLIAM</hi> in his Cares and Toyles, and unleſs
our Wiſhes fail'd us, to the Government of one of the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Empires in the World.</p>
                  <p>I, <hi>ſaid the Very Image of Modeſty it ſelf,</hi> I Govern a
People and Weild Scepters! I who have only learnt to handle,
next the Sacred Bible, Books that either may inſtruct or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
the Mind, then to handle my Needle, <hi>Pen or Pencil, or
to mind my Flowers, Garden,</hi> or whatever elſe belongs to my
Family Affairs, or calls off our Sex from the Contagion of
Idleneſs! And therefore be not deceived in your Opinion, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe,</hi> ſmiling, as if the Prince by his Society had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
me in the Arts of Peace and War. 'Tis true, after
Hard Hunting, or wearied with Continual Audiences, or tir'd
with Inceſſant Cares for the Good of the Republick, He comes to
my Chamber, about Supper-time, upon this Condition, that I
ſhould not tire him more with multiplicity of Queſtions, but
rather ſtrive to recreate him overtoil'd and almoſt ſpent, with
pleaſing Jeſts, that might revive him with Innocent Mirth.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, moſt Noble Auditors, that <hi>MARY</hi> may
be ſaid to have been, for the greateſt part, her own School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtreſs
in the moſt difficult of all Arts, the Art of Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor would ſhe ſo lately have taken Empire upon her,
had it not been to preſerve the Empire from Ruin. And
indeed her firſt Rudiments, from the time that ſhe betook
her ſelf to the Helm of the Republick, while <hi>WILLIAM</hi>
was labouring beyond the Seas to ſtop the Career of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
Enemy, equall'd if not ſurpaſſed the conſummate
Foreſight, Sagacity, Courage, Virtue and fidelity, as well
in Council as in the Field, either of the <hi>Marcia's,</hi> formerly
among the <hi>Britons,</hi> or the <hi>Zenobia's</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62815:64"/>
which amaz'd the World was this, that neither the Pride,
nor the Ambition of thoſe Women actuated her; yet when
all things were in a Tottering Condition within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
when the ſurrounding Ocean ſhook with Gallick Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and all good men were ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Terror of dubious Event, ſhe ſhewed a Courage
undaunted and unacquainted with Fear. The Britiſh Sea was
covered with the Enemies Fleet, in a manner Victorious,
and contemning Female Empire, block'd up the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Havens, when at the ſame time, after their Fidelity ſold
and adulterated for Mony, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and their Admiral
look'd on as immoveable, while the <hi>Belgian</hi> Ships deſerted by
Nefarious Conſpiracy, were ſunk and batter'd, when they
leaſt expected it. Within the Boſom of the Kingdom alſo,
Fell Conſpirators endeavour'd through hidden and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Mines, not delv'd with Spade or Pickax, but Horrid
Machinations, to open a way to a moſt Crafty Enemy, who
under the Specious pretence of <hi>James</hi>'s Name, not only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Queen with Chains, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with Servitude,
Religion with Exile, and to mix all things with Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Slaughter, Conflagration, Sack and Rapine, but ſang
their <hi>IO</hi> Triumphs, as if the Town had been their own.
In <hi>Flanders,</hi> through a certain Fatal Misfortune, and by
the Craft rather then the Courage of <hi>French</hi> Impetuoſity,
our Horſe giving way to their firſt Fury, the Confederate
Forces were worſted. All this while <hi>WILLIAM</hi> was a
great way off in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> in conjunction
with the perfidious <hi>Iriſh,</hi> poſſeſſed all the Cities, Towns,
Caſtles, Fortreſſes, Ports, and the Metropolis of the whole
Kingdom. Nor were Affairs in a doubtful condition only,
but almoſt deſperate, beyond the Power of Human Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to imagin, that ever our Hero, in view of an oppoſing
Enemy, ſhould ford the <hi>Boyn,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did the <hi>Rhine</hi> and
<hi>Baetis,</hi> expoſing his Royal Perſon, not unwounded neither,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62815:64"/>
to the Cannon Bullets, and Muſquet Hail, and in one
day put the <hi>Barbarians</hi> with their <hi>French</hi> Confederates to
flight, and conſtrain <hi>Trembling James</hi> to quit the Iſland.
In the midſt of ſo many Streights, what did <hi>MARY</hi> do?
Did She deſpond, was She terrifi'd with the hideouſneſs of
the Danger? Did She ſhake for fear, when
<q>Et Tellus at<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> Horrida contremuerunt Aequora?</q>
Was ſhe afraid of ſuborn'd Ruffians? Did ſhe ſlink away
from the Royal Palace? Did ſhe, dubious what Courſe to
take, commit her ſelf to Fortune, expecting the Event?
Or rather did ſhe not with a Manly Courage, an Example
unheard of for many Ages backward, appear a <hi>HEROESS</hi>
the more Undaunted in the diſtreſs of Affairs, Shine more

Theſe Acts of Taming a Haughty Enemy, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her Country, were her firſt Eſſays: Theſe were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
Commencements of that <hi>Deborah,</hi> who diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and brought down more then one <hi>Siſera,</hi> curb'd with
a then ſeaſonable Fear. Soon after, all things being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,

chang'd into ſerene Day-light, and her Royal Spouſe
being reſtor'd to her ſelf and to his Kingdoms, ſhe return'd
to her former Quiet and Tranquillity of Mind. The reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who can be ignorant of moſt, Noble Hearers, how <hi>MARY</hi>
while <hi>WILLIAM</hi> march'd with his Victorious Arms
beyond the Seas, quelling the Haughty Fierceneſs of the
<hi>French,</hi> and diſappointing by provident Delay their crafty
Stratagems, how our HEROESS quite extinguiſh'd
the Remainders of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, by the Courage and
Conduct conſpicuous in War of our <hi>Athlone?</hi> Then how
ſtill ſhe duly Day and Night watch'd over the Safety
of her Kingdoms, her Subjects and the Common Cauſe;
how Aſſiduous ſhe was in Court and Council whole Days
together to adviſe with all People for the Common Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;
how ſhe order'd Heaven to be Violenc'd by Prayers
of the People through the whole Kingdom, rather imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her Example, then in Obedience to the Publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
for the Preſervation of <hi>WILLIAM;</hi> and
which I look upon to be more then all the reſt, how by
ſevere Edicts ſhe Triumph'd not onely over Treachery and
Envy, but over Impiety and Prophaneneſs?</p>
                  <p>This AUGUST Queen being ſuch, and ſo Great a
Perſon; ſo endow'd with a Genius ſo capacious to manage
the Affairs of Peace and War, both in Council and the Field,
and ſo true a Keeper of Secrets, no wonder the Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Hero reſted ſecure in the Boſom of His <hi>MARY:</hi> If he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62815:65"/>
truſted her Prudence with his moſt Important and <hi>Toward
Secrets;</hi> which her Curiofity never affected: If ſometimes
preſs'd, though never oppreſs'd by the Weight of Affairs,
and Burthen of his Cares, he call'd her to his Aſſiſtance, and
equally divided with his Royal Conſort, even in moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
and difficult Affairs, <hi>One Mind, and One Will,</hi> his
Leiſure and his Buſineſs, his Profperity and his Misfortunes;
and that always the ſame Union of Hearts, the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Fidelity, the ſame AUGUST CONCORD, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diſturb'd with Diſcontents or Clamours, have always
been the Glory of their <hi>Nuptial Chamber,</hi> ſince their firſt
Conſecrated Tye of Individual Society. So that their <hi>Two
Souls ſeem'd to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited in One;</hi> not ſo much by the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of one Common Blood, or the Law of Conjugal
Neceſſity, as by the <hi>Reſemblance of Manners,</hi> and an Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to reach Heaven. Far unlike to what the Hiſtorian
writes of <hi>Placidia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great,
Marry'd to the Haughty Viſigoth, <hi>Athaulphus,</hi> That there
was then a <hi>Brittle Diſpoſition of Clay joyn'd to a Diſpoſition
of Iron. Livia</hi> is alſo Recorded to have been Eaſie to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
feigning her ſelf wholly at the Beck of her Husband;
not for her Husband's ſake, but for her own and her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's;
for whoſe Advancement ſhe became a Mother per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to the Republick, and ſuſpected of her Husband's
Death. And whatever <hi>Sempronius Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Caius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
boaſt of their <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s, <hi>M. Antonius</hi> of his <hi>Octavia,
Druſus</hi> of his <hi>Antonia, Germanicus</hi> of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> or <hi>Trajan</hi>
of his <hi>Plotina;</hi> Whatever the Britiſh Hiſtory vaunts of
<hi>Marcia Proba,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Guitheline;</hi> of <hi>Maud</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi>
Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt; of <hi>Joan Beaufort</hi> Marry'd to <hi>James</hi>

of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt; <hi>Philippa</hi> of <hi>Hainault</hi> Marry'd to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third, for their Manly Deeds, for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Husbands or their Kingdoms, or for their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62815:66"/>
Conjugal Fidelity; certainly <hi>WILLIAM</hi> might juſtly exalt
his Single <hi>MARY</hi> above all the Wives of Former Times.
Than whom no Woman Greater for her Courage, more
Religious in her Affection, more Amiable in her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
more Modeſt in her Habit, more Affable in her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
or who with a more obedient Readineſs to ſerve
her Royal Conſort, whether preſent or abſent; was more his
Counſellor, <hi>his Hands, his Ears, his Eyes,</hi> and every way
more Aſſiſtant to him. Certainly this was the true <hi>Roſe of
YORK,</hi> born indeed among Thorns, yet free from Prickles
her ſelf; whoſe Heart was without Gall, her Forehead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Frown, her Words without any Sting, her Modeſty
without any Focus, her Piety without any Pretence, or
Vail, unleſs you mean the Vail of Modeſty, Chaſtity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
in which ſence Piety is repreſented Vail'd in the
Ancient Coins; and as now lately the Auguſt <hi>WILLIAM</hi>
told his Mournful Biſhops and Grandees, That <hi>MARY'S
outſide was known to Them; but that her Intrinſick and Juſt
Value was only known to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as in this Mortal life, no Man can hope for perfect
Happineſs, and for that Human Affairs are many times the
Sport of Human Wiſdom, ſo this one thing was wanting
to our Incomparable QUEEN; I mean the Appellation
of Mother, Mother of the World, Mother of the Gods,
Mother of Kingdoms. God ſo providing, becauſe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perpetuates his choiceſt Bleſſings to the World. Then,
left if <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>MARY,</hi> two Miracles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Grace had had Iſſue between 'em, either the Off-ſpring
might have degenerated from ſo great Parents, and
have ecclips'd their Glory: Or had they fill'd up the
<hi>Meaſure of ſo great Names,</hi> they would have exceeded the
Lot of Mortals, and by the <hi>Dazle of ſo much Light</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
giv'n Man a Pretence by too much Veneration, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62815:66"/>
have injur'd Religion and the Worſhip of the Immortal
God. Nor did <hi>MARY</hi> brook her BARRENNESS
with Impatience: She did not cry out, <hi>Give me Children,
or elſe I dye:</hi> She did not Contend with Heaven, nor Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
it with querulous Complaints; but ſo put up her
Prayers to the Almighty, that, though unanſwer'd, they
might rather inflame her Piety and Faith: I ſay, her Piety,
moſt <hi>Noble Auditors,</hi> which <hi>MARY</hi> lookt upon to be the
<hi>Compendium,</hi> the Seaſoning of all Vertues, and the Support
of Kingdoms; and therefore Religion was always her firſt
Care, and her <hi>Supreme Law;</hi> as it was alſo to her Glorious
<hi>WILLIAM.</hi> And therefore it was the frequent Saying
of thoſe two Auguſt PRINCES, <hi>That neither the Guards
of Majeſty, the Councils of Princes, Emperors Legions, Cities
Garriſon, Courage of their Leaders, Well diſciplin'd and Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane
Armies, nor the Sinews of War any thing avail'd to the
Preſervation of Soveraigns or their Subjects without God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
By which means it came to paſs, that ſince the firſt
Foundation of Monarchies, and the rejecting of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was once ſo Sacred to God, never did any other
Reign more happily reſemble the Form and Image of a
<hi>Theocracie</hi> or God reigning over Mankind. I know that
the ſollicitous Piety of more than one Empreſs is extoll'd
to the Sky by the <hi>Annals of the Church;</hi> not with that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Pen of ſome Hiſtorians, neither as when <hi>Joſephus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<hi>Poppaea Sabina,</hi> a Woman of a Proſtituted Leudneſs,
for her Sanctity to the Gods. But whatever Religion has
inſpir'd into the moſt Holy Women, for whom Publick
Prayers have been put up, as for the SAFETY and SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURITY
of the REPUBLICK, and for whom Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Anniverſaries have been Solemniz'd by all the Eaſt,
ſuch as <hi>Helena, Pulcheria</hi> and <hi>Aelia Flaccilla;</hi> yet that all
thoſe Mixtures of Humility and Superſtition, Magnify'd by the
Officious Failings of Human Intereſt ever came near the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62815:67"/>
Sanctity</hi> of our HEROESS, neither Friend nor
Foe will betray his Judgment ſo far as to believe. What
Queen like Her, with equal Ardour and Affection, was ever
ſo Aſſiduous in her <hi>private Converſations with God,</hi> to whom
ſhe not only offer'd the <hi>Firſt-fruits of her Morning-ſacrifices
her ſelf,</hi> but Commanded it to be done by all that ſerv'd
her? <hi>Who converted almoſt into Chappels, her Bed-chamber,
and the Innermoſt Receſſes?</hi> Who ſo reſign'd her ſelf to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
with her Saviour, that beſides her Morning and
Evening-Prayers, beſides her <hi>Monthly and ſet Faſts,</hi> every
Day in her Cloſet alone by her ſelf offer'd up her Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
not of Frankincenſe or Wine, but of Sighs and
Tears? Importuning Heaven with her moſt fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as well for the <hi>Deſpair'd of Converſion of her Father,</hi> as
for the Preſervation of her Husband, her Kingdoms, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the Confederate Cauſe, and the many Calamities
which the Church groans under? More eſpecially, how
fervently did our Queen implore the moſt Merciful Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with deep-fetch'd Sighs, powerfully to avert from the
<hi>Sacred Head of her Royal Husband,</hi> on which the Welfare
of All depended, ſo many Dangers by Sea and Land, ſo
many Darts contorted againſt it; ſo many Machinations
and Ambuſhes of malicious Conſpiracy, ſo many <hi>Bloody
Right Hands of Hir'd Aſſaſſinates?</hi> Who ſo enter'd the
Temple of God, as one that only intended Adoration,
caſting out of her <hi>Royal Chappel the quavering Singers and
Fidlers, admitted meerly to tickle the Ears;</hi> accuſtom'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to compoſe her Mind, and not her Looks or Hair;
moderate in her Dreſs, ſparing in her Train, <hi>but eager and
humble in her Attention?</hi> Who, when ever ſhe enter'd the
Church doors, or happen'd to ſneeze in the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service, impatiently brook'd the Bowings and Crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Sycophant Groud; profeſſing. <hi>That in the Houſe
of God, the diſtinction was the ſame of Meaneſt and Higheſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62815:67"/>
from the moſt Infinite Majeſty.</hi> What other Princeſs, in
the very Impriſonments of Life and Auguſt Glory, in
the ſlippery Station of ſoothing Age, Beauty and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power, in the midſt of ſo many good Wiſhes
and Adorations, was ever obſerv'd to exalt her Mind
ſo ſublimely, yet ſo humbly to Heaven, as if ſhe <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
every Day the Preſence of her Soul in Bliſs; who
thought every Day loſt, that was not ſpent according to
the Precepts of Chriſt?</hi> Who trampl'd with contempt
upon what was Tranſient and Mortal, as <hi>Thrones, Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Palaces, Crowns, Diadems, Robes of Dignity, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Trains,</hi> and whatever elſe ſhe knew to be only
deceitful Shew? But as once <hi>Mecaenas</hi> ſaid, Nobly,
to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> That he would never dye more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
then when he call'd to mind <hi>every Day that he
was Mortal,</hi> through an equal neceſſity of being born
and dying; ſo was this the <hi>frequent, if not daily Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Auguſt Queen.</hi> So that, as it were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
her approaching Mortality, conſcious to her ſelf
that the Laws of Fate never regarded Youthful Years,
nor Majeſty of Thrones, nor the <hi>Pomp of numerous
Guards,</hi> nor ſurrounding Attendance, nor the good
Wiſhes of Men; She, a rare Example, mov'd by the
untimely Death of ſeveral <hi>Illuſtrious Women</hi> in her Court,
thought it high time more familiarly <hi>to converſe with
Death, and meditate upon Eternity.</hi> And that ſhe might
always have him in her Eye, beſides the ſacred Books
which ſhe turn'd over more frequently then ever
<hi>Alexander</hi> did <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads;</hi> ſhe apyly'd her ſelf to
other Books no leſs familiar to her, which taught the
<hi>Art of Dying well,</hi> more eſpecially the Treatiſe upon
that Subject of <hi>Charles Drelincourt,</hi> which ſhe confeſs'd
to his Son, then one of her Phyſicians, <hi>that ſhe had
read above ſeven times over.</hi> So that it may be ſaid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62815:68"/>
of this Auguſt Queen, what <hi>Theophilus Alexandrinus</hi>
is reported to have admir'd upon his Death-bed in the
Great <hi>Arſenius,</hi> who embrac'd a ſolitary Life in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
weary'd out with the Honours of <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s Court,
<hi>Happy Thou, who didſt always ſet this laſt Hour before
thy Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being the Temper and Diſpoſition of <hi>Mary</hi>'s
Mind, and the Sanctity of her Life, how Great may
you think was her Deſire to reform what ſhe found
to be corrupt and deprav'd in the Manners of the
Times, through the Licentiouſneſs of the former Reigns?
The ſollicitous and penſive Queen recall'd to her Mind
the <hi>late Royal Court</hi> and the Nation it ſelf, ſoften'd and
effeminated by the Delights of the Climate and the
Soil, and the Temptations of Sin freed from the Fear
of Puniſhment; when all People wanton'd in Plenty,
Eaſe, Luxury, Play, Balls, and <hi>Vitellian</hi> Waſtings of
the Night, ſo that the Nerves of all manner of Vertue
ſeem'd to be ſhrunk up. She obſerv'd <hi>there was no
Piety, but what was either in the Looks or outward Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:</hi>
Manners everywhere diſhonour'd; the Publick
Churches adorn'd like Scenes; Burthens converted fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
into Honours, and Incumbent Duties made bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial;
the <hi>Miniſtry of the Church into a kind of Civil
Domination,</hi> and the large Revenues of it made the
Pampering Food of Wallowing Sloth and Domeſtick
Luxury. Who can now doubt but that <hi>MARY</hi> us'd
all her Endeavours to reduce all things into better
Order, that ſhe might reſtrain People from Things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt,
more through the ſhame of Tranſgreſſing, then
the Fear of Puniſhment: And that ſhe might promote
to the Care of Spiritual Things, to the Prieſthood and
Preferments in the Church, Auguſt <hi>WILLIAM</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62815:68"/>
this Choice to her piercing Judgment, none
but ſuch as excell'd in Learning, Piety and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
By which means it came to paſs, that thoſe
Vices which openly before erected their Heads, now
<hi>look out for skulking Holes</hi> and voluntary Exile. <hi>Luxury
being expell'd the utmoſt Limits of the Court,</hi> Profuſe
Expences being reſtrain'd, the Incitements and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of Vice being taken away, and the <hi>Diſcipline
of the beſt Times being again reſtor'd.</hi> For all were to
be taught to live and imitate the Manners of both
Princes, and to conform themſelves to the Example of
<hi>WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>MARY,</hi> which was at it were the
Cenſure and Accuſation of Luxury and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>And who can be ignorant of the <hi>Streams of Royal
Beneficence,</hi> that were always flowing from this Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible
Fountain of Piety? Not petty Rivolets, but
large and ſpreading Rivers; <hi>Rivers of Milk, Rivers
of Honey.</hi> Which ran at firſt indeed through the
Thirſty Sands of <hi>MARY</hi>'s Kingdoms, into which a
Cruel Tempeſt had caſt Myriads of miſerable People;
afterwards abounding in Water, through the Annual
Exhibitions of Our QUEEN, amounting to no leſs
then <hi>Forty Thouſand Pounds Engliſh,</hi> if credit may be
given to the Letters written from thence. Then the
ſame Waters were to flow, but through occult and
latent Paſſages, without any noiſe, without any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
beyond the Seas, into the thirſty and gaping
Channels within <hi>Belgium</hi> it ſelf, of ſeveral Societies;
or elſe into the Boſoms of diſtreſſed Families, Widows,
Miniſters, Noble Matrons and Virgins, whoſe Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Patrimonies afforded ample ſubſiſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but now abandon'd and ruin'd. After this,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62815:69"/>
                     <hi>Germany</hi> waſted with Fire and Sword, was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
with the ſame Fountains; or <hi>Switzerland</hi> almoſt
overwhelm'd with Multitudes of the Miſerable flying
for Harbour from the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where
there was neither Houſe nor Hovel for ſuffering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.
But as to theſe things, no Praiſes, no Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks
are more Efficatious then <hi>ſilence and ſecreſie.
MARY</hi> her ſelf was ſilent, tho the Stones now ſpeak.
Yet are they not Pillars, nor Obelisks, nor Chappels
of the Superſtitious, magnificently adorn'd with Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and Marble; nor Conſecrated Oblations to the
<hi>Lady of Loretto;</hi> but more Sacred Monuments then all
theſe; every where <hi>Houſes of Piety, Hoſpitals</hi> both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and private, which ſhe either built with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or liberally endowed. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Moans and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
of an Infinite Number of all <hi>Conditions,
Sexes and Ages,</hi> who Gratefully and with Tears ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
they are beholding to her for their Lives
and all the Conveniences of Life, extoll Her to the
Skies. So that no Body in want, no Body truly poor,
no Body reduced to Miſery, ever found <hi>MARY'S</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
e're clos'd againſt him, or made his caſe known
in vain, whoſe Petitions ſhe did not only anſwer,
when applied to, but for the moſt part prevented, when
ſhe was acquainted with their neceſſities. 'Twould
be too long to enumerate every particular. 'Tis enough,
that we have ſeen in our Age, a <hi>MARY</hi> pouring
forth from Her <hi>Royal Viol</hi> the moſt Precious Liquor
of the Exquiſite Nard, to anoint <hi>Myriads of Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
lying at the Feet of Jeſus,</hi> and in that abundance,
that the Fragrant Odour of it has fill'd the whole
Houſe of God in every Corner of the World. Oh—
<hi>moſt truly the Better Part, made choice of by the belov'd
of God!</hi> Oh! moſt Joyful Cataſtrophe, while thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62815:69"/>
Treaſures that before were ſcattered with an Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Bounty among <hi>Harlots, Buffoons and Players,</hi>
as formerly at <hi>Rome</hi> among the Pathic <hi>Pallas's</hi> and
<hi>Narciſſus's,</hi> and ſuch like Inſtruments of Wickedneſs,
the Senate being defrauded, are now laid out either
for <hi>Publick Preſervation,</hi> or to ſuccour the Neceſſities
of the Miſerable. Oh truly <hi>Royal Munificence,</hi> not
bountiful of other Peoples, but their own, giving
what was by Violence torn from no Man; all People
being convinc'd that this is no <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of what was
unjuſtly taken away, or that an Exchequer now is
open'd again, which being exhauſted and in debt
by <hi>Prodigal Liberality,</hi> or the Expences of raſhly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
Wars, was ſupplied again with the Tears, the
Blood and Subſtance of the People, as was done under
Tyrannic Domination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But whither will my Subject extend it ſelf;</hi> or how
ſhould thoſe Great Actions which cannot be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within any Limits of <hi>Places, Regions or Ages</hi> be
confin'd within the Bounds of <hi>One Oration,</hi> or the
Walls of this Temple? Yet were I not too narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtreightned, how many Things could I ſay of the
Earneſt Deſires of our Pious Queen to ſee extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or, as much as could be, leſſened the <hi>Impious
Diviſions,</hi> too deeply rooted, but firſt ſown by the
<hi>Wicked Emiſſaries of</hi> Rome, to the Ruin of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<hi>How averſe was ſhe from the Severity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Times,</hi> which decreed the <hi>Diſſentors,</hi> if not
to be exterminated by the Sword, yet to be routed
out by Excommunications, and macerated by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments,
Fines and Baniſhment, for the <hi>only ſake

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62815:70"/>
how earneſtly has ſhe wiſh'd in my hearing (that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

too much of Human Invention, being utterly rejected.</hi>
Neither if we have any thing of Prophetic in us, is all
Hopes of ſuch a Union cut off in the Loſs of <hi>MARY,</hi>
while <hi>WILLIAM ſtill remains.</hi> What need more
words, <hi>Conſcript Fathers;</hi> What a Veneration of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
was there in our Heroeſs? What a Reverence
of the Laws? What a Moderation of Mind next to

her Servants, who ſtrove to out-vye each other in
Love, Fidelity and ready Obedience to ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
whoſe Commands were Intreaties? How pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

which tho <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Moral Precepts, looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as Servile, ſhe with <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> thought to

or <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s, who would not dip their Scepters in
the Blood of their Enemies, much leſs of the Guilty,
meerly out of a Deſire to Save and Reform? For <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
was by Nature known to be more prone to
Revenge, only his Prudence made him Mild; which
was the Reaſon he was ſo merciful to <hi>Lucius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,
to <hi>Metellus</hi> the Father, for the Son's ſake, to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius

Gallus,</hi> to <hi>Cinna,</hi> to the Mutinous Legions,
whoſe Names, deliver'd him in Writing, he flung into
the Fire. But <hi>MARY</hi> was ſo ſlow in requiring the
Puniſhment of Offenders, <hi>ſo accuſtomed to Pardon, and
to be atton'd by the Wives, Children and Kindred of
Rebels, and whoever embrac'd the Knees of Majeſty, and
fled to the Altar of Royal Mercy,</hi> that many thought it
an allowance of Treaſon, and an Authorizing Impunity
But the Clemency of the <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PLE</hi>
being rightly conſidered, the Prince was not deceiv'd
by the Perjury; but the Perfidious themſelves, ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
their own ſafety, while they willingly and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
devoted their Lives, their Families and their
Fortunes to the Vengeance of a Revenging God.</p>
                  <p>From that Extraordinary Indulgence, and deſire of
curing rather than ruining the Guilty, who is there
that may not eaſily make a Judgment of all the reſt;
of her <hi>Conſtant Mind in Adverſity,</hi> her ſteady Faith
in God, her Love to her Subjects, her Affection to her
Servants, her Fidelity to her Confederates, her Pity
to the Afflicted, and her Love toward all Men?
Take ſome Specimens in a few words, but moſt
worthy your Attention. Preſently upon the News of
the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> II. <hi>MARY'S</hi> Uncle by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's

When this <hi>Moſt Noble Senate</hi> interpoſed their kind Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Condolement for ſo great a Loſs, by which
her Father came to the Sovereignty, but upon which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62815:71"/>
moſt dark and diſmal Storms threatned the Kingdom,
the Church and the Reformed Religion; ſhe, as ſhe
was never without all the Marks of Civility, after
ſhe had anſwered the Meſſenger, added theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</p>
                  <p>That it was the Will of GOD, through
whoſe Providence, there was no reaſon to
deſpair of the Public ſafety: That the Beſt
Conſolation in Affliction was a Relyance
upon GOD: That there was a Threatning
Cloud hung over Her Father's Kingdoms,
but that he was able to bring forth a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
and moſt Acceptable Cloud out of the

                  <p>Oh <hi>MARY</hi> a true Propheteſs, and Words, a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Augury of what was to come! 'Tis now about
two years ſince that the fatal news reached the Ears
of the beſt of Queens, that News more eſpecially dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our Merchants, that ſo many Ships laden with
Rich Goods and Wealthy Treaſure bound for the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
either through Perfidiouſneſs or ſupine Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
were either ſunk, or burnt, or yielded up to
the <hi>French;</hi> which penetrated <hi>ſo deeply to the Heart of
the Compaſſionate Queen, that ſhe could not forbear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
her Royal Cheeks, before all the Standers by, with
a deluge of Tears;</hi> nor did ſhe only with her Tears
bemoan the loſſes of thoſe who ſuffered after a more
than ordinary manner, but alſo teſtified her ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
in their Miſery to the Widows and Orphans that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62815:71"/>
were hardly able to bear up under ſo great a Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Nor ſhall I ever forget that Cruel Hour, when
going to take my leave of the Princeſs returning to her
Country.</p>
                  <p>I am call'd, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to my Husband,
to my Native Country, to my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Citizens, and whither Providence
leads me, I muſt follow. But when I leave
this Palace, I leave the Seat of my Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
my Tranquillity and Delight: And
firſt ſhall my Right Hand forget it ſelf, before
I will ever forget this my <hi>Belgium,</hi> after ſo
many Proofs of the Affection and Judgment
of this Republick. Whoſe Loſſes, <hi>added ſhe,</hi>
without the leaſt Commotion of Mind, whoſe
Misfortunes and Calamities, and alſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Proſperous and Joyful befalls it, I ſhall
look upon as my own, as long I remember
my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me, Noble Auditors, if Sorrow weakens me
to that degree, and intercepts my Voice in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that I am forced to draw a Vail over all the Reſt.
More eſpecially as to the <hi>pour'd-forth Good Wiſhes of
the People,</hi> thoſe Reſpectful Duties of the Reverencing
Fathers, the Weepings and Lamentations filling all the
Streets, the loud Farewel Acclamations which the <hi>flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Multitude</hi> of Men, Women and Children, of both Sexes
and all Ages ſent up to Heaven, and with which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62815:72"/>
they rather ſeemed to call her back, then take their
leaves of her. <hi>Farewel Pious, Farewel Beſt of Princes,
Farewel the moſt Affectionate to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and never to be
enough Belov'd again.</hi> Oh Severe and Cruel Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance!
Oh ſad and diſmal Preſages of a Laſt and
Eternall Separation! But here my Sorrow ſtops my
Mouth, and I muſt put an end at length to my Moſt
<hi>Bitter Memorial</hi> of her Praiſes. But wherefore do I
ſay an End, when dying ſhe was ſo much above all
Praiſes, by how much the more ſhe approached nearer
to Heaven and Eternity. <hi>Ah Fatal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate
Day,</hi> fit to be expung'd out of the Records of Time,
when all things proſperous by Sea and Land, at Home
and Abroad; a Bright Sun gloriouſly ſhining in
<hi>Britain;</hi> the Court in Jollity, the King Safe, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in perfect Union; the People pouring forth
Acclamations, Conſpirators all ſuppreſſed; the Armies
breathing forth nothing but Battels and Triumphs; all
things compoſed under the Auſpices of the turning
year, as it was thought to more laſting Joys; when
the Eyes of all the World were fix'd upon the <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Pair</hi> of of Sovereigns, and the <hi>Good Wiſhes of
all were, A Happy New Year to the Maſter and Miſtreſs:</hi>
Ah, Unfortunate and Fatal Day, when of a ſudden the
Sky being overcaſt, and a Dark Afrightful Cloud co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Meridian Sun, the <hi>Face of Things was chang'd,</hi>
and Pangs like thoſe of Childbed ſucceeded. This
Day was the <hi>Thirtieth of December,</hi> according to the
<hi>Gregorian</hi> Account, when the moſt deſir'd of Queens,
Youthful, Chearful, Vigorous, and born, as all Men
thought, to <hi>Eternity of Empire,</hi> and whom the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and deſires of all Men had deſtin'd to exceed the
<hi>Reign of Queen Elizabeth,</hi> felt the firſt ſigns of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
Diſeaſe, that was ſoon after to lay her in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62815:72"/>
her Grave. And preſently at the beginning, Nature
Deceiving Art; and the Genius of the Diſtemper, the moſt
Sagacious Phyſicians, while ſome conjectur'd it to be the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> others the <hi>Meaſels,</hi> others an Intercuticular
<hi>Ignis Sacer,</hi> ſome one thing others another; the Flame
gathered ſtrength ſo inſenſibly, and the Fire wanting no
Fuel, fed ſo fiercely, while the <hi>latent Miſchief</hi> ſtuck
within her Bowels, that no <hi>repeated Bloodletting,</hi> no
force of Medicaments, no Human Providence, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of Art could quench the Heat, or drive the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
to the outward Parts.</p>
                  <p>Thus that <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EEN in whoſe Eyes, never was any
Fire but what was truly Holy,</hi> in whoſe Countenance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Colour but what was in imitation of the Roſe,
in whoſe <hi>Praecordia</hi> never any Boiling Choler, or Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Anger ever known, her Mild and Patient Breaſt,
at length the Cruel Flame ſo ſhook, endeavouring to
break forth, that within the ſpace of <hi>Eight Days,</hi> the
moſt Lovely and <hi>Splendid Structure</hi> was burnt down and
fell to the Ground. Yet fell in ſuch manner, that the
Tower of her Reaſon untouch'd, and in vain aſſail'd
by Noxious Vapours, the Soul that only lodg'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſo great a Domicil, the <hi>Divine Mind</hi> that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the whole Frame, and which being ſprinkled with
Coeleſtial Dew, like the Burning Buſh received no
Harm in the midſt of the Flames, <hi>retain'd the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, Her Self and her Condition.</hi> And thus
with a Compos'd and Quiet Mind, the Lamp of Faith
and Hope continually burning; and a Hidden Light
from Heaven illuminating thoſe Darkneſſes wherewith
the Dying Queen was encompaſſed, and the Serenity
of her Forehead leſſening the Ghaſtlineſs of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
the Fortunate <hi>MARY</hi> was to be <hi>Eternally
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62815:73"/>
withdrawn</hi> from the moſt unfortunate Age: Almoſt at
the ſame Years, and with the ſame fury of the Diſeaſe,
as <hi>Alexander was raviſh'd from the World,</hi> or <hi>Germanicus
Caeſar,</hi> bewail'd by thoſe who knew him not, tho their
immortality were not the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For with what a Countenance think ye, <hi>Noble Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
did ſhe receive the Diſmal News of her approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and certain Fate, the terror of Demi-Gods and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's,
before the laſt Combats and Struglings of Expiring
Nature. When the renowned <hi>THOMAS TENISON,</hi>
a Perſon, in whoſe <hi>Learning, Eloquence Integrity and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Mind,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> may more truly
ſeem to be reviv'd than in his Cope and purple, like
another <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> was ſent to comfort up the Queen, and
thus deliver'd himſelf to her at the <hi>laſt minute</hi> of her Life.</p>
                  <p>Madam, <hi>Settle your Affairs, your Family
and your Mind; you have liv'd and finiſh'd
the Courſe which the Parent of Nature hath
allotted you:</hi> She receiv'd it with the ſame
chearfulneſs of Countenance and Mind, as ſhe
was wont to do every thing elſe: not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and murmuring at her laſt Gaſps with
<hi>Germanicus,</hi> that ſhe had juſt cauſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
againſt God, who took her away by an
untimely end, in the Flower of her Youth,
from her Husband, from her Country, from
her Servants, her People and Friends. Nay,
nothing terrified with the Image of Death, ſhe
made this Reply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62815:73"/>
Father, how good a Meſſenger are you to me,
who, as it were, commanded from Heaven, bring the
Tidings of my laſt neceſſity of dying! Here I am
ready to ſubmit to what-ever pleaſes God the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſer
of my Life and Death. I am not now to
learn that difficult Art of Well-dying. I have made
up my Account with God, by the aſſiſtance of my
Surety Chriſt. I have diſcharged my Conſcience long
ſince, I have conſider'd the condition of my Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
I have ſetled all my Affairs; and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
into the Boſom of my Deareſt Husband all
thoſe cares that concern the World: And therefore
he that calls me, finds me ready to lay down the
Burthen of this Life, being no more than a Load
of Infirmities, Sin and Labour.</p>
                  <p>The turning to her Royal Husband, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by her Bed-ſide, ſhe is ſaid to have brake
forth into words to this Effect.</p>
                  <p>Farewell, my WILLIAM, and live mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of our undefiled Matrimony, till Thy Lot ſhall
reſtore Thee to Me, or Me to Thee. I ſhall not
altogether dye, while Thou ſingly poſſeſſeſt the Sole
Image of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s both. Thou wilt be My Living
Tomb, more Sacred and more Honourable than any
Mauſoleum or Funeral Monument. I was bound
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62815:74"/>
to My Spouſe Jeſus, before I was ty'd to Thee,
nor doſt Thou envy him the Prerogative of My
Love, who first joyn'd Me to himſelf. Farewel
the laſt time, and once more live the greateſt
Part of me. Thus it behov'd Me to go firſt,
and that Thou ſhould cloſe My Eyes, and not
I Thine. I was not born to accompliſh thoſe Things
which being begun by Thee, and by Thee ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
carried on, remain to be brought by Thee to
perfection. 'Tis Thy buſineſs to wage Wars; the
Supream Emperor has girded Thy Loyns with a
Sword. And if there be any Senſe of Human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in Heaven, while Thou a Second <hi>Joſhua</hi>
art fighting in the Field, Thy MARY ſhall
pour forth Her Prayers for Thee and Thy <hi>Iſrael</hi>
in the Mountain of Eternity. Lay aſide the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
of Thy Grief, Dear Prince, give way to
Destiny, rely upon God; and forbear to recall Me
again by thy Tears, from the Port of Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the End of my Labours to New Conflicts
which I have ſo often ſuſtained as I have thought
upon thy Dangers; nor haſten to follow this Soul
of Mine, but live out thoſe Years that Nature
has deny'd to Me and Thy own too. And if
Thou haſt any Love for My People, for the Church,
for <hi>Holland,</hi> for all <hi>Europe,</hi> be more careful
than hitherto of Thy own Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62815:74"/>
Soon after, notwithſtanding the Flame that
prey'd upon her Marrow, a ſtronger Fire
from Heaven ſo inflamed her <hi>Coelestial Soul,</hi>
ſo that her fervent Heart that now no
longer thought of any thing Mortal, ſoar'd
up to God, her <hi>ſparkling Eyes were fix'd
upon Heaven,</hi> and her deep fetch'd ſighs
aſcended up to Jeſus; thoſe Precious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
breathing forth moſt Sweet Perfumes
to Heaven, like Coſtly Odours laid on
Burning Coals. Till at length, the <hi>moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
and Pious MARY ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ART</hi> in
the midſt of the Wailing Throbs of all the

Living and deſerving well of Human Kind,
only in the Laſting Example and Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Vertues, the firſt day of the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends
of <hi>January,</hi> in the Year MDCXCV.
toward the Sixth Year of her Reign, in
Thirty Third of her Age, and Seventeenth
of her Conjugal Conjunction with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed

                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62815:75"/>
Thus dyed the AUGUST QUEEN
<hi>MARY,</hi> PIOUS, COMPASSIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATE,
BENEFICENT, VICTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOUS,
BLESSED, who magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
triumphed over <hi>Envy, Ambition, Pride,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Affections, the Vices of the Age, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Courſe of her Life,</hi> and laſtly
over the Great Enemy of Mankind, with
whom we are all to ſtruggle. Thus ſhe
ſurrendred <hi>Scepters, Purple,</hi> thus all Pomp
and Glory, not till ſhe had firſt enjoy'd and
taſted the Vanity of every one; ſhe, then
whom Ancient and Modern Ages never
knew any thing more Majectic or more
Venerable, nothing more Elated above all
the Bounds of Envy or Human Cuſtom;
and like to whom it will never be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Imagination <hi>to form any other
Princeſs, while Kingdoms and Empires Endure.</hi>
Thus now muſt be enterr'd in a Royal
indeed, but ſmall obſcure Six Foot Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
that Noble, but Embowell'd Body of
MARY, from which they now muſt turn
their mourful Eyes and Hearts, who ſo lately
were Chear'd and Exhilerated by the <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Royal Structure,</hi> by the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62815:75"/>
of her Serene and Awful Aſpect, by the
Coeleſtial Splendor of her Eyes, and the
Charming Sweetneſs of her Words. Thus
e're ſhe had meaſur'd the one half of
ELIZABETH'S Reign by ſeveral years,
MARY ceas'd to live. But ſtill this
Name ſeems much more Happy and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious,
than was the moſt Praiſe-worthy
Name of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the
Aſtoniſhment, this the Love and Delight
of the World. She reigned in the Hearts
of a Great Nation, This in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of
all People. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was Famous for the
Splendor, Magnificence and outward Pomp
of her Court and Church; but MARY
won more Renown by her <hi>Humility, her
Bounty and her Alms. Elizabeth</hi> exalted the
Grandeur and Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name.
This ſtudied thoſe Things which tended to
the Conſolation and Succour of the <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
and to the Eternal <hi>Concord, Peace
and Felicity</hi> of her People.</p>
                  <p>

To deceive the Wiſhes of ſo many Mortals,

leſs conspicuous, had it been leſs ſubdued and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed;</hi>
ſo frame your Mind to Conſtancy
of Reſolution, that it may be manifeſt not
only to <hi>Britain,</hi> but to all the World, that
you <hi>could overcome your Self, whom no man elſe
could ever vanquiſh;</hi> even when Invincible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was to be expugn'd, which is the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Victory of all. We do not deſire Your
<hi>Breaſt</hi> ſhould be inacceſſible to Grief or Joy,
which <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> is reported to have
affected, far from any commotion of Mind:
We only deſire this, that after <hi>Your Tears
have prov'd You to be a Man, You would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that You are a Prince,</hi> and ſuch a Prince,
upon whoſe ſingle Fortitude, ſo many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo many People, ſo many Panting
Souls believe their Safety their Liberty,
their Hopes and Fortunes depend. You
have all along been mindful, which we
look upon and eſteem to be the Greateſt
Thing of all, that you are a Chriſtian,
bred up in the more <hi>Sacred School</hi> then the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62815:78"/>
moſt Eloquent of the <hi>Romans,</hi> while you
are fully convinc'd <hi>that nothing happens
preternatural or unuſual to the Laws of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
not ſo much as the fall of a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
much leſs of a Man, ſtill much leſs
of all thoſe who are the expreſs Image of
that Immortal Deity whom they repreſent.
Your Mind GREAT KING, that
horrid Thought ne're troubl'd, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
the Famous <hi>Pompey,</hi> after the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> whether the Gods took
care of things on Earth? You that have
learnt to wage War with Kings, not to
contend with the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> ſuffer not
your ſelf to be incens'd againſt Heaven,
for <hi>redemanding the Pledge</hi> which it had given
You, but for no certain Time. So that
it may ſeem doubtful to many, <hi>whether
You have more Reaſon to lament for what
You have loſt, or to be gratefully thankful
for what You once enjoy'd.</hi> You dive not
into the Secrets of the Eternal Mind, or
that all Provident Wiſdom, who in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeems to us to have deſtroy'd his
own Workmanſhip, and to have diſturb'd
and diſappointed all both Yours and our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62815:79"/>
Hopes. This is not the <hi>Firſt Day Your
Experience,</hi> how many times God fruſtrates
the Deſires of Mortals, frequently curtail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>long-grounded Hopes</hi> by ſpeedy diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and no leſs often converting
into unexpected preſervation the deſpair
ariſing from <hi>ſad and ſudden Accidents.</hi>
Even YOU YOUR SELF, Great
Sovereign, have prov'd by Trials of Your
own, who and how Powerful is that
Upholder of Princes, that Preſerver of
Your Perſon, <hi>even before You were born,</hi>
that Protecting and Avenging God, who
wreſted you from ſo many <hi>Ambuſhments</hi>
when You were hardly come into the
World, who daſh'd in pieces ſo many
Conſpiracies againſt Your Life, held back
the Hands of ſo many <hi>Hir'd Aſſaſſinates,</hi>
ſcatter'd the force of growing Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
ſtifl'd the Hatred and Animoſities
of Your Enemies, averted the Effects of
attempted Poyſons and threatning BUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LETS,
and every where cover'd Your
Sacred Perſon, in Your <hi>Cradle; in Your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
in the Camp, in Battle, in Your Journeys,
and in all Manner of Dangers.</hi> He it was,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62815:79"/>
who when all men thought there had been
a final End put to the Rights of Royal
Succeſſion,
<q>
                        <l>Ex falſo, mendaci ventre, Puerperio:</l>
                        <l>By the Falſe-birth of a Fallacious Womb,</l>
                     </q>
That the Ruin of <hi>Britain,</hi> her Laws and
Religion had been determin'd, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of the Reformed Name, and the
Total Deſtruction of <hi>Carthage</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
raiſed up You, far greater then
<hi>Constantine; MARY,</hi> then <hi>Helena,</hi> to be
the Saviours of the <hi>Britiſh Orb.</hi> So is it
alſo the ſame God who has ſafeguarded Your
Perſon till theſe times by ſo many <hi>Prodigies
and Miracles, to be the Aſſerter of Liberty,
the Curb of Tyranny, the Terror of a Potent
Enemy, the Bulwark of the Chriſtian World,
the Sanctuary of Religion, and the Standard by
which the Succeſſes of the Greateſt Actions and
Deliberations are Debated. In You alone, as in
a certain Center, now the Wiſhes of all men
meet, which before were divided between Two.</hi>
And now, as long as the FIERCE GAUL
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62815:80"/>
