            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ad Reaſon and Religion at once ſo farre forſaken us, as to ceaſe all our Prayers and endeavours for Peace, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the many Lawes of Chriſt, yet even ſenſe it ſelfe were ſufficient to make us weary of Warre; for who ſmarts not grievouſly under that Rod, and bleed not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Sword, unleſſe ſome whoſe hands hold it, and (as the only Kings and Lords of the Time) beare rule and maſter great Revenues and Riches by it, who would elſe be (as they were) poore and powerleſſe without it. Doe we not ſee and feele our Goods and Eſtates waſted and wrung from us by daily payments and Plunders? Our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lawes and Priviledges loſt by Campe and Committee Orders and Ordinances? Are not our Townes turn'd great Goales, and our Houſes (if We be not in others) become Priſons to us? Is not the deereſt bloud of our Selves, Children and Friends, ſpilt in daily Fights and Battailes? And (which above all ſhould be deare unto us) is not our Religion made away betwixt new Ordain'd-Directions, and old allowed Sects and Hereſies? So that, according to the known Lawes of the Land, for Miniſter or People to be a Proteſtant, is to be a Malignant; and to uſe that Service and Forme of Prayer, and Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, for which our forefathers dyed Martyrs, is to make us live and ſuffer as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors. In a word, is not our Livelihood, Liberty, Property, Religion, all gone, and nothing left we can call our owne, but a miſerable life ſcarce worth the owning? And that hardly to be counted our own nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57457:3"/>
for the violence and Tyranny of thoſe who have the Sword in their hands, and us at their Command, with no Law, and as much Conſcience to guide it? He is a block, a ſtone, not a Man, a Chriſtian, that is not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Warre and greedy of Peace.</p>
                  <p>But as all deſires meet in the end of Bliſſe, but vary infinitely about the way; ſo of thoſe who are all for the bliſſe of Peace, all are not of one opinion about the meanes: ſome ſay, <hi>Subdue the King once, and we ſhall be for ever quiet:</hi> and therefore upon every proſperity crye (and oft pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile) for more Men and Mony to follow the blow, and make an end of all: ſo King and Kingdome, all ſhall be ours, and no more need will be to Preſſe more Mony or Men. Others ſay, <hi>let us engage to neither part; but ſtand upon our owne preſervations and our Countreys, indifferent againſt both: So We ſhall either perſwade or force a Peace, at leaſt we ſhall be quiet.</hi> If you will have my opinion, I believe both waies to be wrong, I ſhall deſire your aſſent no farther then you ſhall ſee and approve my reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then firſt, The Warre will not ceaſe, if the <hi>Parliament prevaile againſt the King.</hi> For how then will they governe the Kingdome? If by the known Lawes of the Land, theſe will ſet the Crowne on the Kings head againe, which they have taken off (for to have this Kingdome ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without a King, is to thoſe Lawes utterly unknowne;) then the King will be in as good condition as He was, and they in farre worſe (and that (ſurely) they doe not meane.) If by new and unknown Lawes they muſt maintaine an unknowne, and unheard of Government, the want of the Scepter muſt be ſupplied by the Sword, and that which was the Mother of ſo great a change and Innovation of Church and State, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be the Nurſe to violence and Warre, ſo this will be an alteration, not an end of the Warre. Nor can it (reaſonably) be imagined, ſo long as the King himſelfe is, or any of His Royall Line Lives, or any of their Poſterities ever ſhall endure, or any of their Royall Allies have power abroad, or Loyall conſcience any place at home, that ever this will be a quiet Kingdome, when rob'd of its lawfull Soveraigne and annoynted King, no more then a body without blood-ſhed can be cut off from its naturall Head. And were there a common ſecurity againſt all this, guilt in the breaſts that bred theſe Woes, will be an enemy potent enough to maintain the Warre againſt others. if Diviſions and Iealouſies turne not the Sword upon themſelves, whileſt they contend who ſhall poſſeſſe and put on the Regall Power, which the right and Royall owner is diveſted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57457:3"/>
off. So that, of neceſſity (for a long time at leaſt, if not for ever) the Kingdom muſt be govern'd by Force.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid; <hi>Though not His Majeſty that is, there may be a King:</hi> what then can be expected, but Woe upon Woe to the Kingdome? Aske our Fore-fathers and they will tell us, what calamity they ſuffered of old under Crowne Competitions: Till the two Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> were married, and ſo made one, was not this Land a very field of Bloud? And during the 30 and odde <note n="*" place="margin">80, of the blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Slaine in theſe Warres. <bibl>Speed.</bibl>
                     </note> yeares of theſe cruell . Warres, what fearefull Slaughters of Princes, Nobles, and Commons, were made; whileſt the doubtfull Right of the Crowne, was diſputed by the whole Kingdome; divided and inraged about it? Behold <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and it will ſhew us what a deere-price they have paid for the ſeizure of the <hi>Bohemia Crowne,</hi> albeit (that having been Elective) faire Right was pretended and pleaded for the ſeizure? How many Millions of Pounds, and Lives, hath that Crowne-Quarrell coſt them? Are not their Countries, Cities, Townes, Villages, Houſes, Lands, Eſtates, Goods, all deſtroyed by the Warres? Are they not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd in a Sea of bloud to this day, after ſixe and twenty yeares of reigning Warres and Woes, no ſigne of Peace appearing, or likelihood of their end, till want of Men for Warre, or Bread for them, ſhall force it? He is a Stone, that ſees not, Marble, that melts not, to think how <hi>England,</hi> too like poore <hi>Germany</hi> already, would be yet more miſerably like it, ſhould any Head, but the right-borne, weare the <hi>Engliſh Crowne.</hi> That, then ſhould it be (as God forbid it ever ſhould) would be the beginning, rather then an end of the Warres.</p>
                  <p>Nor is <hi>Indifferency of Counties and Perſons, the way to bring it to an end.</hi> For ſo the King ſhall be oppreſſed (if not aſſiſted) in His extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the Parliament will prevaile; without a miraculous bleſſing it muſt needs be ſo: if they have all the Purſe of the Land, and moſt of the Power and People for them, whileſt We ſtand betwixt both, looking on, that ſhould ballance the force, or caſt it againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But by this meanes, neceſſity will inforce and effect a Treaty of Peace: The unbloudy, doubtleſſe, is the moſt bleſſed Peace (Curſed be he that is againſt it! Thrice happy he, or they, who ſhall make it!) But what hopes then to ſee it, when already all meanes have failed it? Will they, who upon even and equall Termes of Strength, are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in their Propoſitions, by proſperity grow more moderate? For His Majeſty to yeeld to their demands, whatſoever they are, is not to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57457:4"/>
make an end of the debate, but Himſelfe, (His Crowne and His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, That may bring things to a Period perhaps, but not to a Peace:) Victory can doe no more but what it will, when the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Party is deſtroyed, that before hindred it: And what can the King more yeild, then what He hath already offered and aſſured for Peace? For Himſelfe, halfe His Sword in the <hi>Militia,</hi> and a good piece of His Crowne; And for the <hi>Church,</hi> as much as can conſiſt with His <note place="margin">In the Treaty at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> the <hi>Militia</hi> offered by the King to be put into the hands of twenty, of which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to chooſe 10. and ſo the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> Honour and Oath to Almighty God, and the Peace of His Conſcience? If this was not thought price enough for the Purchaſe then, will it come at a rate more reaſonable, now? No; We have great reaſon to ſuſpect, that, if where the power is, mind had been ever truely to it, it would have come then. For, though it be m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt ſure, that the King, both in Reaſon and Religion, hath been a vehement Seeker of it, and offered ſo much to purchaſe it; and, as certaine, that even of them who ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and live in <hi>London,</hi> and in the Countrey under Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary power, many, for their parts, doe heartily deſire it, (foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruine of all without it:) it is to be feared, That the Authors and Actors in theſe Warres, will not (for particular Reaſons and reſpects) ever allow of Peace; but whileſt the power is in their hands, for ever abet and maintaine the Warre. They may think, that no Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can warrant their indemnity. If one Parliament, for the preſent neceſſity, ſhould pardon all, another (more free) may revoke it: If the State ſhould, particular Perſons of ruined Fortunes, and Families, will never forgive it: If they would; they ſhould live the hate and ſcorne of the Land, that now at pleaſure rule it, and all their fellow Subjects, and the King Himſelfe in it. I would they did not both think, and aſſuredly know, and beleive it.</p>
                  <p>And will a County ſtand ſafe, if a Kingdome fall to ruine? Alaſſe! what Lands or Houſes can be dry in a Common deluge? How can the Limbe live, if the Body languiſh? The Kingdome thus may fall into a Conſumption (it muſt, if the vitall and ſubſtantiall parts faile in an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the fundamentall Conſtitution of it) and theſe may be the laſt Limbs that fall, and that's all they get by their Neutrality, to be the laſt. Nay, perhaps (by the juſt judgement of God and Man) they may be the firſt; hated of both ſides for their Indifferencies, and deſtroyed by the proſpering ſide, for not ayding the proſperity. Surely, as thoſe are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Peace and Countrey that reſiſt the King, and wage Warre againſt Him with His owne Weapons, People, Monies, Meanes, and ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57457:4"/>
diſtreſſe and drive Him to extremities, to defend Himſelfe againſt them: So thoſe who doe not aſſiſt the King, are not friends to the Peace of the Kingdome. And if Divines ſay true, that he murthers life, who can, and doth not preſerve it, as well as he that deſtroyes it, I dare excuſe neither, of the Bloud that is ſhed in the interim; The Reſiſtant from being poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively guilty of it all, and the Non-aſſiſtant, privatively ingaged in the Guilt.</p>
                  <p>And though (I confeſſe) it ſeeme ſome Plea, that many in the Kings Armies, are ſo inſufferable in their Carriages, that even they breed a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of His Cauſe for it; yet this will not hold good, till it appeare, that the King doth not abhorre and bewayle the injuries of His good People, and yet, is in ſo great extremity for want of Meanes and Supplies, that He knowes not (to His great griefe) how to remedy it. Nay, it recoyles upon them; for did they joyne hands with Him to aſſiſt with their lives and fortunes to uphold Him, in whom their ſafety, as much as His owne conſiſts; this would not be done, and ſuffered. For, then a due Pay, would maintaine an exact Diſcipline; and the firſt Offendors, having their due puniſhment, the reſt would not dare to tranſgreſſe. Then the uſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne hands would be needleſſe, moſt apt on both ſides to offend.

                  <p>To conclude then, (for my Lines have already exceeded a Letters bounds) whoſoever feares God, and honours the King, (as every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhould) or loves Church, or Kingdome, or Countrey, (as every Child of either ought) let him take this to heart, and ponder it well, and he will ſee, there is no way left to Peace, but to raiſe the King to proſperity; to aſſiſt Him with our Meanes and Lives, Valiantly and Vigorouſly to haſten it; leaſt for want of ayding Subjects in the juſt defence of Himſelfe, and the Throne by God committed to Him; He be forced (as his Predeceſſors of old, and his Enemies now) to ſue and ſeek for help from others, His owne People failing Him, the ſad, but only remedy for a diſeaſe ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, which is then left Him.
