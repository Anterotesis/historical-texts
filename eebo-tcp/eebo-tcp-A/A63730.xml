            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Saturday the fourth of June the Earle of Stamford came to Leiceſter, where his Lordſhip iſſued out his warrants to all the head Conſtables to ſummon all the Trained, and deſired all the private men within their ſeverall diviſions to appeare before him, or his Deputies at the Towne of Leiceſter on Wedneſday following. Afterwards the very ſame Saturday, came a meſſenger from Yorke with a writ to the high Sheriffe, to ſend forth his Majeſties Proclamations to the contrary. Notwithſtanding the warrants being ſent out by the head Conſtables, the Countrey came in, both Trained Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, private men and Voluntiers, farre beyond expectation, who generally declared themſelves for the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid Earl, thought fit again the week following to appoint the five companies of the Trained Bands to appeare ſeverally in ſuch convenient places as might be moſt for their eaſe, and leaſt chargeable, and thereupon they came.</p>
            <p>The firſt on Tueſday, June the fourteenth, to Broughton-Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, where appeared above an hundred Voluntiers, and the Trained and private men, all ſave onely out of one diviſion, the head Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable thereof being perſwaded by the Parſon of the Towne, where he lives, refuſing to ſend out his warrants; and yet out of that diviſion, the Trained Souldiers and private men in many Townes came in without warning.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, on Wedneſday at Kibworth, where there was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good appearance, except ſome of the Clergy, with above an hundred Voluntiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65742:3"/>The third, on Thurſday at Melton Mowbray, where they made: generall appearance.</p>
            <p>The fourth, upon Friday at Ruinborough, where the appearance was very good, conſidering how many great Papiſts and ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted people live thereabouts.</p>
            <p>The laſt, on Munday at the Coptoake, there was a generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Trained and private men with two hundred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers at the leaſt. And in every one of theſe places, very many of the Countrey men came to the ſaid Earle, and deſired him to helpe them to armes for their owne defence, and the publicke ſafety.</p>
            <p>And after his returne home from that daies Muſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that <hi>Richard Hawford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Bale</hi> Knight, <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, had prevailed with Mr. Major of Leiceſter to ſet a guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the remainder of the Magazine left at that place, and that one of that worthy Gentlemans ſervants ſhould watch the ſame, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with divers deſperate fellowes of that Towne; the Earle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thither, accompained with the Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelrig</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Bramour,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen of good worth in that County, and commanded the Major to remove away the remainder of the Powder, Match and Bullets, and put it into a place of more ſtrength and ſafety.</p>
            <p>But on Wedneſday the fifteenth of June, as the ſaid Earle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Kibworth, he heard at Leiceſter that Mr. <hi>Henry Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> Eſquire, was immediately before come thither from Yorke with a commiſſion of Aray. So the ſaid Earle having firſt given advertiſement thereof to the Parliament, removed very early the next morning a great part of the Magazine from the Towne of Leiceſter for more ſecurity to his owne houſe. That day being Thurſday, Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> cauſed the under Sheriffe (in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> high Sheriffe) to ſend forth warrants in the high She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes name, to the whole County, as well Trained Souldiers, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men and the Clergy ſhould come to Leiceſter according to his commiſſion, there to be muſtered upon the Wedneſday following.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65742:3"/>
In the interim, the ſaid Earle having notice given him from divers perſons, of many menacing words caſt forth againſt him, tending to the hazard of his life, and deſtruction of his houſe; on Munday the ſaid Earle ſet a guard about his houſe of an hundred and fifty of his neighbours, tenants and ſervants, who hearing the report, came and offered themſelves to doe him ſervice, whom he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at his owne charge.</p>
            <p>On Tuſeday early in the morning a meſſenger from the high Court of Parliament, did attach the under Sheriffe for ſending forth warrants by vertue of the commiſſion of Aray, and with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient guard carried him away to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the afternoone Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> being newly returned againe from Yorke, came to Loughborough, and hearing that the under Sheriffe was gone, ſent out againe other warrants himſelfe to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all the Townes neare his abode to come to him at Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough betimes the next morning, &amp; being the Maſter of certain Cole-mines he cauſed all his horſes belonging to the engines, to be in a readineſſe, and there raiſed about one hundred Collyers out of Darbiſhire, whom he had armed with Pikes, Muskets and Calivers, and few or none of the Trained Bands comming into him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he aſſembled his friends (many of them Papiſts &amp; ſuch others as are ill affected towards the proceedings of Parliament) at Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough on Wedneſday morning, where, and at Aſhby-de-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zouch he bought up all the powder and old troopers ſadles that on the ſuddain could be got: when all were come in together, he made proclamations that whoſoever wanted armes ſhould be furniſhed from Garradon Abbey, and other Popiſh places, as is credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potted; and ſo they marched with drums and colours towards Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, eight miles diſtant, himſelfe ſtill marching before them when they came neare a Towne.</p>
            <p>Within three miles of the Towne of Leiceſter, he cauſed pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, match and bullets to be delivered to every Musketier, and commanded by a Sergeant that every man ſhould charge with powder and bullet, which was done immediately, and match
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65742:4"/>
lighted, and ſo himſelfe marched in the head of them into the Towne of Leiceſter, and commanded they ſhould not diſcharge till the word of command was given.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Stamford having intelligence of his march by Scouts which he ſent abroad, might have laid his ambuſcado, and by the advantage of the way have cut them all off, for the ſaid Earle was furniſhed with about an hundred and fifty Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and ſhot, and twenty good horſe well mounted with carabines and piſtolls, beſides the neighbouring Townes came running in, offering their lives and fortunes at his diſpoſe, and in effect, the whole County ready and willing to have beene raiſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>The provocations were great from Mr. <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and his troops conſiſting of horſe as well as pike men and musketiers, who gave out by the way (to the terror of the people that came affrighted and gave intelligence to the ſaid Earle) that they would fetch away the Magazine from him, fire his houſe, have his heart bloud, and never leave him till they had made him turne up the white of his eyes. Yet the ſaid Earle choſe rather to ſtand upon his guard at home, then to ſally out and levie a warre, well weighing with himſelfe the miſery that might have enſued, not to this County alone, but to the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Haſtings</hi> and his company were come into the field, but not in the place where by the warrant he had appointed the Countrey to meet (very few of the Trained Bands obeying that ſummons) having made a ſpeech, and therein pretended his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Countrey, that he had not a Papiſt in his company, and that his deſire was to avoid the effuſion of bloud, he began to read his Commiſſion of Aray.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the high Sheriffe cauſed the Votes of both Houſes of Parliament to be read, wherein his Commiſſion was voted ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: So a Meſſenger from both Houſes of Parliament did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attach him as a delinquent, as alſo ſome others of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners that were preſent with him, by vertue of a Warrant from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65742:4"/>
high Court of Parliament. Then notwithſtanding his foreſaid Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, divers of his Company both horſe and foot did cock their Match and draw out their Piſtolls, and preſented them towards the high Sheriffe: Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> and the reſt being much danted at the unexpected courage and ſpirit both of the high Sheriffe and the Meſſenger, ſaid after they had executed his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they would appeare at the Parliament; but the horſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them (conſiſting chiefly of the foure delinquents their Captaines, Officers, and Servants, with others, Papiſts and unknown perſons, reſcued them, and ſhot at the Meſſenger, and two Butchers of Leiceſter throwing Mr. <hi>Haſtings</hi> on horſeback, he drew out his Piſtolls and marched directly with the reſt of his company to his Inne, and ſhut up the Gates.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Stamford hearing of the Reſcue, ſent fome of his Servants to Leiceſter, to give command to every man that had any Souldiers in his houſe to ſeize their Armes when they were aſleep. In the meane while Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> and the reſt hearing what men the ſaid Earle had in a readineſſe, and apprehending that Mr. Sheriffe might require his aide, did all thereupon very fairely runne away that night at a leven of the clock. So it hapened that all or moſt of their Armes were ſeized upon according to the ſtratagem propoſed, and are now remaining at the diſpoſe of the ſaid Earle of Stamford, the which ſhall bee imployed as both Houſes of Parliament pleaſe to command.</p>
            <p>It is to be remembred that Mr. <hi>Haſtings</hi> had his man at Leiceſter ready upon the comming downe of the Earle of Stamford to carry him word, and that hee immediatly poſted away to Yorke, and brought back with him Proclamations, which he diſperſed about the Country, writing himſelfe upon the backſide in the nature of a warrant that it was to be conveyed from towne to towne, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in every place.</p>
            <p>That the day before the Country was to come in, that he came himſelf to Leiceſter &amp; Maſter Major and the Aldermen being met in the Towne Hall to adviſe about the appearance of the trained
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65742:5"/>
ſoulders in the Towne (which Maſter Major promiſed on Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before ſhould come in, if the Earl of Stamford would grant him a warrant which was granted) Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> came to the Hall, and ſent for Maſter Major from his brethren, and ſo changed his reſolucion that hee utterly refuſed to iſſue out any warrants, for which Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> ſince hath procured a letter of thanks from the King to the Major.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> the eighteenth of this inſtant <hi>June,</hi> 1642. they received at the riſing of the Houſe of Commons their warrants againſt the ſeverall Delinquents therein named, viz. <hi>Henry Hastings</hi> Eſquire, Sonne to the Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Huntington, Henry Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> of <hi>Humerston</hi> Eſquire, Sir <hi>Richard Hawford</hi> Knight, Maſter <hi>Pate,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bale</hi> Knight, and Maſter <hi>Gregory</hi> the Under-Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the 20 of the ſaid Moneth, they came by eleven of the clocke in the morning to <hi>Broadgate,</hi> in the ſaid County, to the Houſe of the Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Stamford;</hi> where they were informed that his Lordſhip, together with the Lord <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> were training of Souldiers at a place called <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pt Oake,</hi> three myles diſtant from the Lord <hi>Stamfords</hi> houſe, where the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Stanforth</hi> waited till the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when they returned from the Muſter, and preſently tooke horſe as the Lords, Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> and others then preſently did, and waited on them to the Town of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> where they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſaid Lords: and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> who received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that Sir <hi>Richard Hawford</hi> had prevailed with <hi>Thomas Ruddier</hi> the Maior there, to ſet a Guard on the remainder of the
<pb facs="tcp:65742:6"/>
Magazine, and they having ſent for the ſaid Maior and Juſtices of the ſaid Town of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> removed the ſame from the South-gate, into a ſtrong Tower called <hi>Neworks-Gate</hi> neere the Town; by the approbation of the ſaid Maior, and Juſtices who were then preſent that evening, and the next day they waited for further command from their Lordſhips, and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg;</hi> who being at <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> where they heard that Maſter <hi>Henry Haſtings,</hi> ſir <hi>Richard Hawford,</hi> and others, intended to come in a Warlike manner againſt them the day following being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 23. of the ſaid <hi>June,</hi> after the Lords, and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg</hi> had fixed the Votes of both Houſes on the In-Gates, where they the ſaid Maſter <hi>Hastings,</hi> and the other Delinquents were to lye, and had done what was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the buſineſſe for the time preſent. About nine of the clock in the morning they departed to the Lord <hi>Stamfords,</hi> leaving the ſaid <hi>Chambers,</hi> and <hi>Stanforth,</hi> together with one <hi>Thomas Horton,</hi> one of the ſaid Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> ſervants at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> to wait on the ſaid High-Sheriffe <hi>Archdale Palmer</hi> Eſquite, to mannage the buſineſſe, as the Sheriffe and they were required.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> aforeſaid, about eight of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the High-Sheriffe came to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> attended on by men Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſwords and javelins to keep the Kings Peace there; that being in an Inne called the <hi>Hearon</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> ſaw a Barrell brought in by a Porter, which he deemed to be Gunpowder, which doubts to ſatisfie, the Porter was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whereupon he confeſſed, the Barrell was filled with Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that it was ſent thither by Maſter <hi>Andrew Hawford.</hi> Son to the ſaid ſir <hi>Richard Hawford;</hi> which Powder, the High-Sheriffe then ſeized upon, by power of an Order of the Honorable Houſe of Parliament, Dated the eleventh day of <hi>June</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>That about ten of the clock the ſaid day, one Maſter <hi>Walter Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> mounted on a Bay ſtone-horſe, with a great ſaddle and Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, in a Warlike manner Rid into the yard of the ſaid Inne, and with him the Lord <hi>Lovelace,</hi> and one Maſter <hi>Killegrew</hi> (as they were informed) who traverſing up and down the ſaid Yard on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, the ſaid <hi>Walter Haſtings</hi> ſwore that he would eat up the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:65742:6"/>
               <hi>Stamford;</hi> to which one of the ſaid gentlemen replied, leave one bit for me, or to the ſame effect; and then the ſaid <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> made a ſhort diſtracted ſpeech to the people ſaying: What, my friends and countrymen, ye ſtand for the King and the <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who have ever been true to the Crown: The people anſwered, we are all for the King and the Parliament. Then the ſaid <hi>Haſtings</hi> required the ſaid Sheriffe to read His Majeſties Proclamation, which (with an oath of God damn him) he the ſaid <hi>Hastings</hi> ſwore the Sheriffe had received; Whereunto the Sheriffe modeſtly replied, it was not true; which done, he the ſaid <hi>Hastings</hi> departed, and the reſt of his company, in an outragious and uncivill manner, ſwearing and curſing as they rid out of the ſaid Inne.</p>
            <p>About two of the clocke of the ſame day, they the ſaid High-Sheriffe, <hi>Chambers,</hi> and <hi>Stanforth,</hi> had intelligence that the ſaid Delinquents, or moſt of them, with all their Troops and Foot Souldiers, to the number of about 300, were met in a Commou or green, called the Horſe Faire neere the ſaid Town, whither they repaired, attended on by the ſaid Sheriff, men on Foot, and found the ſaid Parties there, met ſome of them on great Horſes, with Petronels, and the reſt Armed with ſwords, Muskers, Caleevers, Pikes, and Halberts.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Henry Hastings,</hi> alighted and told the Sheriffe, and the reſt; he was come thither to execute his Majeſties Commiſſion of Array, to himſelfe and others, then granted for that County, and then tendered to the ſaid Sheriffe two bundels, the one of Proclamations, the other of books, with an impoſition on the Sheriffe to read and publiſh the ſame; Maſter <hi>Hastings</hi> ſwearing, he was the Kings body and Soul; and the ſaid Sheriffe being often and very uncivilly preſſed by the ſaid Maſter <hi>Hastings,</hi> to read and publiſh the ſaid Proclamations, made this anſwer: I cannot performe His
<pb facs="tcp:65742:7"/>
Majeſties ſingle commands, till I have acquainted the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament therewith, nor do any thing contrary to their Votes, I am for the King and for the Parliament, (and if I periſh, I periſh.) Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> produced the laſt Votes of both Houſes concerning the illegality of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Array, and read the ſame plainly and openly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring thereby to let the people hear them ſo read. And likewiſe read the laſt Declaration of both Houſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Militia, concluding with theſe words; God ſave the King and Parliament: which words the people plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reiterated (except the ſaid <hi>Henry Hastings,</hi> who (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) againe ſaid, he was the Kings body and ſoule;) and then and there the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> drew forth the Warrants of both Houſes, and intreated the peoples ſilence, read them openly, and called the Delinquents Maſter <hi>Henry Hastings,</hi> Sir <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Hawford,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bale,</hi> Maſter <hi>John Pate,</hi> they being then and there preſent and within hearing (as the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> was informed) requiring them at their utmoſt perils to yeeld their obedience to the power of the ſaid Warrants; and the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> required the Sheriffe to keepe the Kings peace, and to be aiding and aſſiſting unto him the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> in this due execution of the ſaid Warrants. To prevent and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly hinder the due execution whereof, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> began to read the Kings Commiſſion, which being in Latine, and he not being ready therein, did there indevour to comment upon the meaning thereof in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which being altogether then unable to doe, one Maſter <hi>Edward Palmer</hi> the Towne Clarke of <hi>Leicester,</hi> tooke the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion out of his hand, ſaying, it ought to be read, who read it in Latine, to which moſt of the people gave eare, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing. That done, the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> laid a ſtrict command on the ſaid Sheriffe to have a ſpeciall care of the
<pb facs="tcp:65742:7"/>
ſaid Delinquents, and required them likewiſe to obey: which words the ſaid Sir <hi>Richard Hawford</hi> hearing (being very neere to the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi>) anſwered thus, <hi>viz.</hi> When this his Majeſties great buſineſſe is over, then Ile come to you Maſter Sheriffe, and give ſuch ſecurity for my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Parliament as ſhall be fitting. Maſter <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> alſo willed the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> to repaire to the <hi>Angell</hi> in <hi>Leicester,</hi> where all the Delinquents (as he ſaid) inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to lodge that night, where he ſhould have civill deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them; which he much doubted, ſeeing their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage before in the Field to be ſo outragious</p>
            <p>Immediately after that Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> pretended he would divide the Troopers and Souldiers into foure parts, and call them by their names; but having ſevered them for his owne advantage, to gaine his Horſe, he was (by two rude Butchers, one by name <hi>Henry Cotes,</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> was informed) lifted up into his great Saddle, and a Petronell ready cockt given into his hands, by one of the ſaid Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Then the Cavaleers and the reſt of the Souldiers joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the rude multitude, and about foure and twenty Parſons in Canonicall Coats, well horſed, rid all towards the Towne with loud exclamations, a KING, a KING, others, for the KING, for the KING, in a ſtrange and unheard of manner; Captaine <hi>Worſley</hi> giving the Word of command to the Souldiers, Make ready, Make ready; which as they were providing to doe, a ſudden and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aboundance of raine falling, the Souldiers were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from firing.</p>
            <p>Then the ſaid Maſter <hi>Walter Hasting</hi> endeavoured to ride over the ſaid <hi>Chambers,</hi> who to prevent that, got up a high banke, whereon a rude fellow ſtanding ſtrooke him with a club on the breaſt, and with the violence thereof the ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:65742:8"/>
               <hi>Chambers</hi> fel backward into a ditch, but as ſoone as his ſtrength ſerved him to recover himſelfe, he made all the haſte he poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could towards the Towne to eſcape murthering: then they followed Maſter Sheriffe, <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Stanforth</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the Cap, at the Cap, which was at that time on <hi>Chambers</hi> his head, and one of the perſons endeavoured to ride over the ſayd Sheriffe, another of them would have ridden over the ſaid <hi>Stanforth,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Walter Hastings</hi> gave fire at <hi>Chambers</hi> with one of his Petronels, but the ſame did not diſcharge; ſo they got to the ſaid Inne with much hazard, who afterwards were in forced, for their owne ſafety, to ſtand upon their guard; and being very much tyred, were unable that night to doe any further ſervice, except the writing of a Letter, which <hi>Chambers</hi> did, and recommended the ſame to the Lord <hi>Stamford,</hi> and the reſt to ſatisfie what done, and to have further direction what was fitting after to be done therein; which directions about one of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were, that the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Stanforth</hi> ſhould by the aſſiſtance of the ſaid Sheriffe, and the Major, and Juſtices of <hi>Leicester,</hi> uſe their beſt power and endeavour to ſurprize the ſaid Delinquents: But they too ſenſible of their ill carriage and miſdemeanour, privately in the evening had got away, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Souldiers behinde them. About two of the clocke the ſaid morning, the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Stanforth,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the Juſtices and other Towneſmen, with about forty perſons more, made ſeverall ſearches in Innes and other drinking-houſes, where they found many ſouldiers laid in bed, ſome on the bed, but moſt of them diſtempered with drinke; and then ſeized on their Armes, and cauſed them to be carried to the Sheriffe in the ſaid Inne, <hi>viz.</hi> one great Saddle, three Petronels, and about one hundreth Pikes, one Launce, above threeſcore Muskets and Caleevers, about twenty Swords,
<pb facs="tcp:65742:8"/>
and foure long Peeces about ſeven foot in length. All which the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Stanforth,</hi> and others of the Sheriffes men, ſearching, found charged ſome with Bullets, ſome with halfe Bullets, and others with gooſe ſhot very deepely and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly; which amunition being left in the Sheriffes cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, part of them were delivered to ſome of the traine Band, and the reſt preſented by the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> to the Lord <hi>Stamford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> being further informed that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Henry Hastings</hi> had procured about an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Colliers out of <hi>Darbiſhire,</hi> to attend him to <hi>Leicester;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like ſearch, the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> with <hi>Stanforth</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſaid Juſtices and Towneſmen, found two of them, who confeſſed they were poore <hi>Darbiſhire</hi> Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, neither trained men, nor men that had at any time before that borne Armes for any other, and that they and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes were commanded to come to <hi>Leicester</hi> in aid of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and their Maſter the ſaid Maſter <hi>Hastings;</hi> which ſaid Colliers never appeared before the Sheriffe to demand or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Armes, but got privately away: the Major in the whole progreſſe of this buſineſſe, ſeemed backward to doe any thing for the Parliament, and as forward to further Maſter <hi>Hastings</hi> in the buſineſſe aforeſaid. The effect of which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Stanforth</hi> thought fit humbly to preſent to the conſtruction and grave conſideration of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Aſſembly; ready alwayes to proſtrate themſelves and ſervice at your further commands,</p>
