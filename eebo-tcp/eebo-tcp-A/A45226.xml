            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bleſſed be my God, who in the midſt of theſe wofull tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, hath vouchſafed to give me theſe calm, &amp; holy thoughts; which I juſtly ſuppoſe, he meant not to ſuggeſt, that they ſhould be ſmothered in the breaſt wherein they were conceived, but with a purpoſe to have the benefit communicated unto many. Who is there that needs not vehement excitations, and helps to Devotion? and when more than now? In a tempeſt the Mariners themſelves doe not only cry everyman to his God, but awaken <hi>Jonah,</hi> that is faſt aſleep under the hatches, and chide him to his prayers. Surely, had we not bin failing in our devotions, we could not have been thus univerſally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; That duty, the neglect whereof is guilty of our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,

muſt in the effectuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, be the meanes of our recovery. Be but devout, and we cannot miſcarry under judgements; Wee is mee, the teares of penitence, were more fit to quench the publique flame, than bloud. How ſoone would it clear up above head, if wee were but holily affected within? Could wee ſend our zealous Ambaſſadours up to heaven, we could not fail of an happy peace. I direct the way; God bring us to the end; For my owne particular practice; God is witneſſe to my ſoule, that (as one, the ſenſe of whoſe private affliction is ſwallowed up of the publique) I ceaſe not daily to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>DEvotion is the life of Religion, the very ſoule of Piety, the higheſt imploiment of grace; and no other than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion of heaven by the Saints of God here upon earth; every improvement whereof is of more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and value to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoul, than all the profit &amp; contentments which this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61794:5"/>
world can afford it.</p>
                     <p>There is a kind of Art of Devotion (if we can attain unto it) whereby the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof may bee much advanced: We have known indeed ſome holy ſoules, which out of the generall precepts of piety, and their own happy experiments of Gods mercy, have, through the grace of God, grown to a great meaſure of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this way; which yet might have been much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited, and compleated, by thoſe helps, which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter illumination and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of others might have afforded them: Like as we ſee it in other faculties; there are thoſe, who out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dexterity, and their own frequent practice, have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61794:5"/>
got into a ſafe poſture of defence, and have handled their weapon with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable skill, whom yet the Fence-ſchoole might have raiſed to an higher pitch of cunning: As nature is perfited, ſo grace is not a little furthered by Art; ſince it pleaſeth the wiſedome of God, to work ordinarily upon the ſoul, not by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power of miracle, but in ſuch methods, and by ſuch means, as may moſt conduce to his bleſſed ends. It is true, that all our good motions come from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; neither is it leſſe true, that all the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails of others proceed from the ſame Spirit; &amp; that good Spirit cannot be croſſe to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he therefore that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61794:6"/>
good thoughts into us, ſuggeſts alſo ſuch directions, as may render us apt both to receive and improve them: If God be bounteous, we may not be idle, and neglective of our ſpirituall aids.</p>

                     <p>IF you tell me (by way of inſtance in a particular act of Devotion) that there is a gift of prayer, and that the Spirit of God is not tied to rules; I yeeld both theſe; but withall, I muſt ſay there are alſo helps of prayer, and that we muſt not expect immediate inſpirations: I find the world much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in both; They thinke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61794:6"/>
that man hath the gift of prayer, that can utter the thoughts of his heart round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto God, that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelf ſmoothly in the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt, and preſſe God with moſt proper words, &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate vehemence: And ſurely this is a commendable faculty wherſoever it is: but this is not the gift of prayer; you may call it, if you will, the gift of Elocution. Doe wee ſay that man hath the gift of pleading, that can talk eloquently at the Barre, that can in good termes loud and earneſtly importune the Judge for his Client; and not rather hee that brings the ſtrongeſt reaſon, and quotes his books, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents with moſt truth,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61794:7"/>
and cleareſt evidence, ſo as may convince the Jury, and perſwade the Judge? Do wee ſay hee hath the gift of Preaching, that can deliver himſelf in a flowing manner of ſpeech, to his hearers, that can cite Scriptures, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that can pleaſe his auditory with the flowers of Rhetorick; or rather, he, that can divide the Word aright, interpret it ſoundly, apply it judiciouſly, put it home to the Conſcience, ſpeaking in the evidence of the Spirit, powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the gainſayers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the dejected, and drawing every ſoule nearer to heaven? The like muſt we ſay for prayer; the gift whereof hee may be truely ſaid to have, not that hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61794:7"/>
the moſt rennible tongue, (for prayer is not ſo much a matter of the lips, as of the heart) but he, that hath the moſt illuminated apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the God to whom he ſpeakes, the deepeſt ſenſe of his own wants, the moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger longings after grace, the ferventeſt deſires of ſupplies from heaven; and in a word, whoſe heart ſends up the ſtrongeſt groanes and cries to the Father of mercies.</p>
                     <p>Neither may we look for <hi>Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> &amp; immediate inſpirations; putting our ſelves upon Gods Spirit, in the ſolemn exerciſes of our invocation, without heed, or meditation; the dangerous inconvenience wherof hath been too often found in the raſh, and unwarrantable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61794:8"/>
that have fallen from the mouths of unwary ſuppliants; but we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelves with due preparation, to that holy worke; we muſt digeſt our ſutes; &amp; fore-order our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the Almighty; ſo that there may be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and neceſſary uſe of meet rules of our Devotion.</p>
                     <p>He, whoſe Spirit helps us to pray, and whoſe lips taughts us how to pray, is an all-ſufficient example for us: all the skill of men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, cannot afford a more exquiſite modell of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Devotion, than that bleſſed Saviour of ours gave us in the mount; led in by a divine, and heart-raiſing preface, carried out with a a ſtrong and heavenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61794:8"/>
wherein an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full compellation makes way for petition; and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes way for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; the petitions mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled in a moſt exact or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for ſpirituall bleſſings, which have an immediate concernment of God, in the firſt place; then for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall favours, which concern our ſelves, in the ſecond; ſo punctuall a method had notbeen obſerved by him that heareth prayers, if it had been all one to him, to have had our Devotions confuſed, and tumultuary.</p>

                     <p>The ſoule that is rightly affected to God, is never void of an holy Devotion; where ever it is, what ever it doth, it is ſtill lifted up to God, and faſtned upon him, and converſes with him; ever ſerving the Lord in feare, and rejoycing in him with trembling.</p>
                     <p>For the effectuall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite firſt, that the heart bee ſetled in a right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our God; without which, our Devotion is not thankleſſe onely, but ſinfull: With much labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; agitation of a mind
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61794:11"/>
illuminated from above, we muſt find our ſelves wrought to an high, awfull, adorative, and conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of that incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majeſty, in whom wee live, and move, and are; One God, in three moſt glorious Perſons, infinite in wiſdome, in power, in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in mercy, in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in all that he is, in all that he hath, in all that he doth; dwelling in light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, attended with thouſand thouſands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; whom yet we neither can know, (neither would it availe us if we could) but in the face of the eternall Son of his Love, our bleſſed Mediatour God and Man; who ſits at the right hand of Majeſty in the higheſt

off, as dwelling above, in the circle of heaven, but beholds that infinite Spirit really preſent with him; <hi>The Lord is upon thy right hand,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61794:12"/>
Is the heart heavy with the grievous preſſures of affliction? the ſoule goes in to his God, and pours out it ſelfe before him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt bemoanings, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; the God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy anſwers the ſoule again, with ſeaſonable refreſhings of comfort: Is the heart ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wounded and blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the conſcience of ſome ſinne? it ſpeedily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it ſelfe to the great Phyſician of the ſoul, who forthwith applyes the balm of Gilead for an unfailing and preſent cure: Is the heart diſtracted with doubts? the ſoule retires to that inward Oracle of God for counſail, he returnes to the ſoule an happy ſettlement of juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: Is the heart deeply

affected with the ſenſe of ſome ſpeciall favour from his God? the ſoul breaks forth into the paſſionate voice of praiſe &amp; thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; God returns the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing teſtimony of a cheerful acceptation: Oh bleſſed ſoul, that hath a God to go unto upon all occaſions; Oh infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy of a God, that vouchſafes to ſtoop to ſuch intirents with duſt &amp; aſhes.

There is no creature of whom we may not learn ſomething; we ſhall have ſpent our time ill in this great ſchoole of the world, if in ſuch ſtore of Leſſons, we be non-proficients in Devotion. Vaine Idolaters make to themſelves Images of God, whereby they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repreſent him to their thoughts and adoration; could they have the wit and grace to ſee it, God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken order to ſpare them this labor, in that he hath ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in every creature ſuch impreſſions of his infinite power, wiſdome, goodnes, as may give us juſt occaſion to worſhip and praiſe him with a ſafe and holy advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our ſoules: <hi>For the inviſible things of God, from

Who can be ſo ſtupid as not to take notice of the induſtry of the Bee, the providence of the Ant, the cunning of the Spider, the reviving of the Flye, the worms endeavour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61794:16"/>
who that takes notice of them, cannot fetch from every act, and motion of theirs, ſome monition of duty, and occaſion of devout thoughts? Surely, I fear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us Chriſtians, may juſtly accuſe our ſelves as too neglective of our duty this way; that having thus long ſpent our time in this great Academy of the world, we have not, by ſo many ſilent documents, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to aſcribe more glory to our Creator; I doubt thoſe creatures if they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their brutality with our reaſon, being now ſo docible as to learn of us ſo far as their ſenſe can reach, would approve themſelves better Scholars to us, than we have been unto them.</p>

hearts grow to be hard and ſtrange to God, but that they may be held on in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall acknowledgement of him, and acquaintance with him; and, on the other ſide, that they be not ſo overfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their perpetual rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, as that they grow to be (like that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh votaries) faſhionable; which if great care bee not taken, will fall out, to the utter fruſtrating of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.

and lives. How can we bee but throughly humbled, to ſee our ſouls utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with the odious and abominable leproſie of ſin: We find that <hi>Uzziah</hi> bore up ſtoutly a while, againſt the Prieſts of the Lord, in the maintenance of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious preſumption, but when he ſaw himſelf turn'd <hi>Lazar,</hi> on the ſuddain, he is confounded in himſelfe, and in a depth of ſhame haſtens away from the preſence of God to a ſad, and penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all retirednes.

ſhame, and grieve our eyes with the foule nature and condition of our ſins, but we muſt repreſent them to our ſelves in all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that may aggravate their nainouſneſſe.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61794:29"/>
ſufficient illumination from thee; It is not in the darke that I have ſtumbled, and faln, but in the midſt of the clear light and ſun-ſhine of thy Goſpel, and in the very face of thee my God; neither have theſe been the ſlips of my weakneſſe, but the bold miſcarriages of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; neither have I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended out of inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inadvertency, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and againſt the checks of a remurmuring conſcience; after ſo many gracious war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and fatherly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, after ſo many fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full examples of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after ſo infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of thy favours.</p>
                     <p>And thus having look't inward into ourſelves, and taken an impartiall view of

our own vileneſſe, it will be requiſite to caſt our eyes upward unto heaven, and there to ſee againſt whom we have offended; even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an infinite Majeſty, &amp; power, an infinite mercy, an infinite juſtice; That power and Majeſty which hath ſpread out the heavens as a Curtain, and hath laid the foundations of the earth ſo ſure that it cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; who hath ſhut up the ſea with bars and doors, and <note place="margin">Job 38.</note> ſaid, Hitherto ſhalt thou come and no further, and here ſhalt thou ſtay thy proud waves; who doth whatſoever he will in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the Devils to their chains, able therfore to take infinite vengeance on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

But it will ſavor too much of earth, if we be more affected with temporall bleſſings, than with ſpirituall and eternall.

the wondrous things of thy Law.</hi> Lo, <hi>Davids</hi> eyes were open before to other objects; but when he comes to Gods Book, he can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without a new act of apertion: Letters he might ſee, but wonders hee could not ſee, till God did uncloſe his eyes, and enlighten them. It is not therfore for us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly to break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and to think by our naturall abilities to wreſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the precious Caskets of the Almighty; and to fetch out all his hidden treaſure thence, at pleaſure; but we muſt come tremblingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and in all humility crave his gracious admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I confeſſe I finde ſome kinde of envy in my ſelf, when I read of thoſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61794:47"/>
obſervances of high reſpects given by the Jewes to the Book of Gods Law: and when I read of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Saint, that never read <note place="margin">Carolus Bor romaeus.</note> the Scripture but upon his knees, and compare it with the careleſſe neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I can accuſe my ſelf, and perhaps ſome others: Not that wee ſhould reſt in the formality of outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of reverence, wherein it were more eaſie to be ſuperſtitious than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout; but that our outward deportment may teſtifie, and anſwer the awfull diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our hearts: whereto we ſhall not need to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, if wee be throughly perſwaded of the Divine Originall, and authority of that Sacred Word. It was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61794:47"/>
motive enough to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> zealouſly to plead for, and religiouſly to adore the Image of their <hi>Diana,</hi> that it was <hi>the Image that fell down</hi>

                     <p>Every Clauſe therefore of that God-inſpired Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, muſt be, as reverently received by us, ſo ſeriouſly weighed, and carefully laid up; as knowing, that there is no tittle therein without his uſe. What we read, we muſt labour to underſtand; what wee cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we muſt admire ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and modeſtly enquire
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61794:48"/>
of. There are plain Truths, and there are deep myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The bounty of God hath left this Well of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-water open for all; what runs over is for all commers; but every one hath not wherewith to draw. There is no Chriſtian that may not enjoy Gods Book, but every Chriſtian may not interpret it; thoſe ſhallow Fords that are in it, may be waded by every Paſſenger, but there are deeps wherein he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſwim, may drown. <hi>How can I without a Guide,</hi> ſaid that Ethopian Eunuch: Wherefore ſerves the tongue of the Learned, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Ignorant? Their modeſty is of no leſſe uſe than the others skill. It is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61794:48"/>
a woefull condition of a Church when no man will be ignorant.</p>
                     <p>What ſervice can our eyes doe us in the wayes of God without our thoughts? our diligent and frequent reading, therefore, muſt be attended with our holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: we feed on what we read, but we digeſt only what we meditate of. What is in our Bible is Gods; but that which is in our hearts, is our own: By all which our care muſt be, not ſo much to become wiſer, as to become better, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtill to reduce all things to godly practice.</p>
                     <p>Finally, as we enter into this task with the lifting up of our hearts for a bleſſing, ſo we ſhut it up in the ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

eſpecially with a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; whoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power is, to undoe our former ſins, and to mold the heart and life to a better obedience: A grace ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the want of it (as in extream corruption of the ſtomack) turnes the wholſome food of the ſoul into poiſon; An impenitent man therefore comming to Gods Board, is ſo far from benefiting himſelf, as that he eates his owne judgement: Stand off from this holy table, all yee that have not made your peace with your God; or that harbour any knowne ſinne in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; not to eat is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, but to eat in ſuch a ſtate is deadly; yet reſt not in this plea, that ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61794:60"/>
come becauſe yee are unreconciled; but (as yee love your ſouls) be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled that you may come.</p>
                     <p>Another Grace neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pre-required is charity to our brethren, and readineſſe to forgive; For this is a communion, as with Chriſt the head, ſo with all the members of his myſticall body: This is the true Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſt of God our Saviour, wherein wee profeſſe our ſelves inſeparably united both to him and his; If there be more hearts than one at Gods Table, he will not own them; Theſe holy elements give us an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of our ſelves: This bread is made up of many grains, incorporated into one maſſe; and this wine
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61794:60"/>
is the confluent juice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cluſters; neither doe we partake of ſeverall loaves, or variety of liquors, but all eat of one bread, and drink of one cup. Here is then no place for rancour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; none for ſecret grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and heart-burnings; <hi>Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there</hi>

                     <p>BEſides theſe graces there are certaine holy prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions ſo neceſſary that without them our ſoules can never hope to receive true comfort in this bleſſed Sacrament; whereof the firſt is an hungring and thirſting deſire after theſe gracious means of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: What good will our meat doe us without an appetite? Surely without it, there is no expectation of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61794:61"/>
either reliſh, or digeſtion; as therefore thoſe that are invited to ſome great feaſt, care firſt to ſeed their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ere they feed their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; labouring by exerciſe to get a ſtomach, ere they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it; ſo it concerns us to do here: and, as thoſe that are liſtleſſe, and weak ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mached, are wont to whet their appetite with ſharp ſawces; ſo muſt wee by the tart applications of the law, quicken our deſires of our Saviour here exhibited.</p>
                     <p>Could wee but ſee our ſins, and our miſeries by ſin; Could wee ſee God frowning, and hell gaping wide to ſwallow us, wee ſhould not need to bee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to long for our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; and every pledge of his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61794:62"/>
favour would be precious to us.</p>
                     <p>Upon the apprehenſion of our need of a Saviour and ſo happy a ſupply ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of preſented unto us, muſt needs follow a renewed act of true thankfulnes of heart to our good God, that hath both given us his dear Son to work our redemption, &amp; his bleſſed Sacrament to ſeal up unto us our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus wrought and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed; And with ſouls thus thankfully elevated unto God, we aproach with all reverence, to that heavenly Table, where God is both the Feaſt-maſter and the Feaſt. What intention of holy thoughts, what fervour of ſpirit, what depth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion muſt we now find in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61794:62"/>
our ſelves? Doubtleſſe, out of heaven no object can be ſo worthy to take up our hearts. What a clear repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation is here of the great work of our Redemption? How is my Saviour by all my ſenſes here brought home to my ſoul? How is his paſſion lively acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes? For lo, my bodily eye doth not more truely ſee bread and wine, than the eye of my faith ſees the body and bloud of my dear Redeemer; Thus was his ſacred body torn and broken; Thus was his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud poured out for me; My ſins (wretched man that I am) helped thus to crucifie my Saviour; and for the diſcharge of my ſins would he be thus crucified:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61794:63"/>
Neither did hee only give himſelfe for me, upon the Croſſe, but lo, both offers and gives himſelf to me in this his bleſſed inſtitution; what had his generall gift been without this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Now my hand doth not more ſenſibly take, nor my mouth more really eate this bread, than my ſoule doth ſpiritually receive, and feed on the bread of life; O Saviour, thou art the living bread that came dome from heaven; Thy fleſh is meat indeed, and thy bloud is drink indeed: Oh that I may ſo eate of this bread, that I may live for ever. He that commeth to thee, ſhall never hunger; he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in thee, ſhall never thirſt: Oh that I could now
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61794:63"/>
ſo hunger, and ſo thirſt for thee, that my ſoul could be for ever ſatisfied with thee; Thy people of old, were fed with Manna in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet they dyed; that food of Angels could not keep them from periſhing; but oh, for the hidden Manna, which giveth life to the world, even thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſelf, give me ever of this bread, and my ſoule ſhall not dye but live: Oh the precious juice of the fruit of the Vine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou refreſheſt my ſoul! Is this the bloud of the grape? Is it not rather thy bloud of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is poured out for me? Thou ſpeakeſt, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, of new wine that thou wouldeſt drink with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61794:64"/>
thy Diſciples, in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kindome, can there be any more precious and pleaſant, than this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou cheereſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſoule? our palate is now dull and earthly, which ſhall then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and celeſtiall; but ſurely, no liquor can be of equall price or ſoveraignty with thy bloud; Oh how unſavory are all earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies to this heavenly draught! O God, let not the ſweet taſte of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Nectar ever goe out of the mouth of my ſoul; Let the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable warmth of this bleſſed Cordiall ever work upon my ſoul, even till, and in, the laſt moment of my diſſolution. Doſt thou bid me, O Saviour, do
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61794:64"/>
this in remembrance of thee? Oh, how can I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee? How can I enough celebrate thee for this thy unſpeakable mercy? Can I ſee thee thus crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes, and for my ſake thus crucified, and not remember thee? Can I find my ſins acceſſary to this thy death, and thy death meritoriouſly expiating all theſe my grievous ſins, and not remember thee? Can I hear thee freely offering thy ſelfe to me, and feele thee graciouſly conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf into my ſoul, and not remember thee? I doe remember thee O Saviour; but oh that I could yet more effectually remember thee; with all the paſſionate affections of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61794:65"/>
a ſoul ſick of thy love; with all zealous deſires to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thee, with all fervent longings after thee, and thy ſalvation; I remember thee in thy ſufferings, Oh doe thou remember me in thy glory.</p>

                     <p>The Devout Soul hath thus ſupt in heaven, and returns home, yet the work is not thus done: after the elements are out of eye and uſe, there remains a dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of this celeſtiall food, by holy meditation; and now it thinks, Oh what a bleſſing have I received to day! no leſſe than my Lord Jeſus, with all his merits; and in and with him, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the remiſſion of all my ſins, and everlaſting ſalvation: How happy am I, if I be not wanting to God &amp; my ſelf? How unworthy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61794:66"/>
ſhall I be, if I doe not ſtrive to anſwer this love of my God and Saviour, in all hearty affection, and in all holy obedience?</p>
                     <p>And now after this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly repaſt, how do I feel my ſelf? what ſtrength, what advantage hath my faith gotten? how much am I nearer to heaven than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? how much faſter hold have I taken of my bleſſed Redeemer? how much more firm and ſenſible is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him?</p>

A devout man is he that ever ſees the inviſible, and ever trembleth before that God he ſees; that walks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, here on earth, with the God of heaven; and ſtill adores that Majeſty with whom he converſes; That confers hourly with the God of ſpirits in his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; yet ſo, as no familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can abate of his aw, nor fear abate ought of his love. To whom the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are ever open; that he may go in at pleaſure to the throne of grace, &amp; none of the Angelical ſpirits can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to challenge him of too much boldneſs: Whoſe eyes are well acquainted with thoſe heavenly guardians, the preſence of whom hee doth as truly acknowledge,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61794:68"/>
as if they were his ſenſible Companions. He is well known of the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for a daily ſutor in the Court of heaven, and none ſo welcome there, as he: He accounts all his time loſt that falls beſide his God; and can be no more weary of good thoughts, than of happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>His boſome is no harbour for any knowne evill; and it is a queſtion whether hee more abhorres ſin, or hell; His care, is to entertain God in a clear and free heart, and therefore he thruſts the world out of doors, and humbly beſeeches God to welcome himſelf to his owne: He is truly dejected, and vile in his owne eyes: Nothing but hell is lower
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61794:68"/>
than he; every of his ſlips are hainous, every treſpaſſe is aggravated to rebellion; The glory and favours of God heighten his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; He hath lookt down to the bottomleſſe deep, and ſeen with horror what he deſerved to feel everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly; His cries have been as ſtrong, as his fears juſt; and he hath found mercy more ready to reſcue him, than he could be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: His hand could not be ſo ſoon put forth as his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, for deliverance. The ſenſe of this mercy hath raiſed him to an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, to a moſt fervent love of ſo dear a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; that love hath knit his heart to ſo meritorious a deliverer, and wrought a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61794:69"/>
bleſſed union betwixt God and his ſoul. That union can no more be ſevered from an infinite delight, than that delight can bee ſevered from an humble, &amp; cheerfull acquieſcence in his munificent God; And now, as in an heavenly freedome, he pours out his ſoul into the boſome of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in all faithfull ſutes for himſelf and others; ſo, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes God in the bleſſings received, and returns all zealous prayſes to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>He comes reverently to the Oracles of God, and brings not his eye, but his heart with him; not careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly negligent in ſeeking to know the revealed will of his Maker, nor too buſily

inquiſitive into his deep counſels; not too remiſſe in the letter, nor too peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in the ſenſe: gladly comprehending what hee may, and admiring what he cannot comprehend. Doth God call for his ear? He goes awfully into the holy preſence and ſo hears, as if he ſhould now hear his laſt: Latching every word that drops from the Preachers lips, ere it fall to the ground, and laying it up carefully where hee may be ſure to fetch it. Hee ſits not to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but to learn, yet ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and knowledge is the leaſt drift of his labour; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is his own but what he practiſeth. Is he invited to Gods feaſt? he hates to come in a ſoul and ſlovenly dreſſe;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61794:70"/>
but trims up his ſoul, ſo, as may be fit for an heavenly gueſt: Neither doth he leave his ſtomach at home cloyed with the world, but brings a ſharp appetite with him; and ſo feeds as if he meant to live for ever. All earthly Delicates are unſavory to him, in reſpect of that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Manna: Shortly, he ſo eates and drinks, as one that ſees himſelf ſet at Table with God, and his Angels; and riſes and departs full of his Saviour; and in the ſtrength of that meal walks vigorouſly and cheerfully on towards his glory. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he well knows that he lives, and moves, and hath his being in God, ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his life, motions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly to God; ſo act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61794:70"/>
all things, as if God did them by him, ſo uſing all things, as one that enjoyes God in them; and in the mean time ſo walking on earth, that he doth in a ſort carry his heaven with him.</p>

If their deſires cannot be bounded, yet their motions muſt; When they have the full ſight of heaven above them, they cannot climbe up into it; they cannot poſſibly ſee that whole glorious contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and when the whole earth lies open before them, they can meaſure but ſome ſmall peeces of it. How can

                     <p>YOu ſee then by this time, how little reaſon I have to be too much troubled with this impriſonment, or my friends for me; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there are ſome ſorts of Priſoners, which neither you nor I can have teares e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now to bewaile: and thoſe eſpecially of two kinds.</p>
                     <p>The one, thoſe that are too much affected with an outward bondage: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe that are no whit affected with a ſpirituall.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt rank are they that ſink under the weight of their Irons: Poor impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſoules, that groaning under the cruelty of a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh thraldom, or a Spaniſh
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61794:89"/>
Inquiſition, want Faith to bear them out, againſt the impetuous violences of their tormentors: I ſorrow for their ſufferings; but for their fainting more: Could they ſee the Crown of Glory, which the righteous Judge holds ready for their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Patience, they could not but contemn paine, and all the pomp of Death, and confeſſe that their Light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction (which is but for a moment) works for them a far more exceeding &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory. But alas, it is the weakneſſe of their eyes, that they onely look at the things that are ſeen, cloſe walls, heavy fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſharp ſcourges, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe racks, and other dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full engins of torture, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61794:90"/>
ſee not the things which are not ſeen, the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their victory, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe. Had they had <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> eyes, they would have emulated his martyrdome; Surely whoſoever ſhal but read the ſtory of the mother and the ſeven brothers in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> &amp; that of the fourty Armenian Martyrs frozen to death, reported by <hi>Gaudentius,</hi> and ſhall there ſee the fainting revolter dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncomfortably in the Bath, whiles the other thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nine (together with their new converted Keeper) are crowned by an Angel from heaven, cannot chuſe (except he have nothing but ice in his boſome) but find in himſelf a diſpoſition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous of their courage, &amp;

ambitious of their honour; But alas, what ever our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and purpoſes may be, it is not for every one to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the glory of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome; this is the higheſt pitch, that earthly Saints are capable of: He muſt be more than a man, whom paine and death cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from his holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and eſpecially, the lingring execution of both. It is well if an age can yeeld one, <hi>Mole:</hi> In what termes ſhall <hi>I</hi> commemorate thee, O thou bleſſed Confeſſor, the great example of invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible conſtancy, in theſe back-ſliding times (if at leaſt thy rare perſeverance be not more for wonder than imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) whom thirty yeares tedious durance in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quſitory
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61794:91"/>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> could not weary out of thy ſincere profeſſion of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth? All this while thou wert not allowed the ſpeech, the ſight of any, but thy perſecutors: Here was none to pity thee, none to exhort thee; If either force of perſwaſion, or proffers of favour, or threats of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, could have wrought thee for thy perverſion, thou hadſt not at laſt dyed ours. Bleſſed bee the God of all comfort, who having ſtood by thee, &amp; made thee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the death, hath now given thee a Crown of life and immortality; and left thee a noble patterne of Chriſtian Fortitude, ſo much more remarkable, as leſſe frequently followed.</p>

Whether I look into the former, or the preſent times, I finde the world full of ſhrinking profeſſors.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61794:92"/>
their Libellaticks, ſuch as privately by themſelves, or by ſome allowed proxey, denyed the Faith, yet with their money bought out this ignominy, and ſinne of any publick Act of Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Not to ſpeak of thoſe many thouſands which fell downe before <hi>Solyman</hi> the ſecond, and held up their finger to ſignifie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to his Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, for eaſe of their taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? how many do we hear of daily of all nations, and ſome (which I ſhame and grieve to ſay) of our owne, who yeeld to receive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and to renounce their Saviour? Oh the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition of thoſe diſtreſſed Chriſtians! If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to their profeſſion,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61794:92"/>
they live in a perpetual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of torment; If revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they run into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an everlaſting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in hell; Even this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſtraint puts me into the meditation of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable durance; Why do not all Chriſtia nhearts bleed with the ſenſe of their deplorable eſtate? why is not our compaſſion heighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the depth of their perill, and miſery?</p>
                     <p>What are our bowels made of, if they yearne not at their unexpreſſible cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? Ye rich Merchants, under whoſe imployment many of theſe poor ſoules have thus unhappily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, how can you bleſſe your ſelves in your baggs, whiles you ſee themembers

of Chriſt your Saviour, thus torn from him, for want of a petty ranſome? Ye emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons whom God hath advanced to power &amp; greatneſs, how can you ſleep quietly upon your pillows, whiles you think of the cold and hard lodgings, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry bellies, the naked and waled backs of miſerable Chriſtians? Laſtly, what fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers ſhould we all, that profeſſe the dear name of Chriſt, poure out unto the God of heaven for the ſtrengthning of the faith &amp; patience of theſe afflicted ſouls againſt the aſſaults of violence? and for their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and ſpeedy deliverance out of their woefull capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity?</p>
