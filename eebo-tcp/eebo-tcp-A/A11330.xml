         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

MARTINS in the Iſle of REE.</head>

               <p>THE CYTADELL or FORT</p>
            </figure>
            <p>YOu may ſee in this Map ſent ouer from the Iland, by a
Gentleman of quality, a true Deſcription of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell
or Fort, ſeated neere to the Towne of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
in the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> beleaguered at this preſent by the
the Engliſh Armie, vnder the commaund of the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Prince, the Duke of BVCKINGHAM.
This place (which is now held by <hi>Monſiur Thorax,</hi> and
1500. Frenchmen appointed for that Seruice) is almoſt of
a perfect Quadrangular forme, euerie point flanking one
another, according to the preciſeſt rules of Fortification.
The Caualier or Keepe it ſelfe, is made of free ſtone, and
hath without it a Counterſcarfe of earth, the Rampiers
whereof are about 18. foote high. Vnder this there lyes
three halfe Moones, the points whereof are directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another Counterſcarfe, which being the vttermoſt
of all, is alſo made of ſtone, and ſerues for a circumuallation
vnto the reſt of the workes, being about an Engliſh mile in
compaſſe. The ground vpon which it is ſeated, is for the
moſt part ſandie, onelie to the North ſide it ſtands on a
hard rocke, which being enuironed with the Sea, makes
the Fort vnapproachable of that ſide. The Engliſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
themſelues vpon the three other Auenues, from the
land ſide, and hauing drawne their approaches within the
diſtance of Musket ſhot at point blanke, they haue raiſed
diuers batteries vpon ſeuerall platformes to anſwere the
Counterbatteries of the Enemies, vpon which the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
haue planted tenne or twelue whole Cannons, beſides
manie other Peeces of Ordnance of the leſſer ſize. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our men ſeuerallie doe their duties, both Officers
and common Souldiers three or foure dayes in a weeke, by
watching in the Trenches, Approaches, and Batteries, yet
they gaine ground ſtill of the French, and thinke no labour
too much, nor taske to heauie which may tend to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, and to the ſeruice of their King and Countrie.
Wherein they are encouraged by the preſence of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
who carries a Cudgel in one hand, and Coyne in the
other, to puniſh the ſloathfull, and to reward the vertuous.
Moſt nights his Excellence walkes the firſt round perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie
himſelfe, and if hee findes anie man negligent in his
dutie, he cauſeth him to ſuffer according to the qualitie of
his offence for the good example of others. Monſieur <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi>
the Gouernour of the Cittadell, offers to cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of the horrible complot againſt the Duke, by ſeeking
to murther him (by his Miniſter) with a <hi>Rauilliacke</hi> Knife.
But notwithſtanding all his Appologies and excuſes the
common ſuffrage of opinion hath found him guiltie of that
ignoble crime. The French that are beſieged hold in their
hornes, and though they were verie daring at our firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yet euer ſince they haue ſhewed themſelues no hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurres,
for they haue ſuffered themſelues to be ſurrounded
with our Intrenchments, and yet neuer made as much as
one ſallie. They are much diſtreſſed for want of Water,
euer ſince their Conducts were cut off, ſo that they hang vp
ſheetes in the ayre, to take the raine-water that falls downe.
Their prouiſion of victualls within is not great, and if wee
may beleeue thoſe Fugitiues which runne from them daily,
the better ſort of them eate horſefleſh for great dainties.
And which is worſe, they are not like to be releeued in haſt,
all the Land-paſſes being quite blockt vp, and the Sea being
ſo carefully kept by our Fleete, that a Skiffe or long-Boate
cannot paſſe in without diſcouerie and ſurpriſall: So
that there is great hope (if wee faſten our iudgements on
probable coniectures) that Famine or the Sword will mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
this place, notwithſtanding all reports and coniectures
to the contrarie.</p>
