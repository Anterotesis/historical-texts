         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T'S no leſs common with men would ſeem wiſe, than inconſiſtent with thoſe that are really ſo, to find a facile Faith for what they like, and a ſturdy Diffidence for what they diſlike: Like the twins of a byaſs'd Judgment, the one favouring of Affection, the other of Prejudice, and both of Partiality.</p>
            <p>That ſome Paſſages in the precedent Life will meet with ſuch, I make no queſtion, and therefore thought it not unneceſſary to acquaint them with this Truth, that what therein is related concerning our Author, by the learned Gentleman that penn'd the Narrative, was receiv'd not form uncertain wandring Reports, but Authentick Information, from the Tongues and Penns of thoſe, that (during his life upon Earth) were his familiar Aſſociates; Men conſciencious both in Words and Deeds, well knowing what ſtrict account muſt be rendred of both. And how ſad an Account have they then to make, whoſe Throats, like open Sepulchers, blaſt with their breath (as far as their venome reaches) the moſt eminent Gifts of God in men that bear his Image? whereof did they know the danger, it could not but make them tremble to conſider how their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Arrows will return and ſtick in their own Souls: Yet have ſome not feared malitiouſly to defame this deep illuminated man of God; A man whoſe Writings (though not to us made Canonical by Miracles) mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear to have been the Dictates of God's Spirit; and the Will of
<pb facs="tcp:171633:3"/>
God, the Rule of his whole life; alwaies reſigning himſelf (as his own Pen teſtifies) to the Divine Will: to will and work nothing but according to the will of God. Yet againſt the ſpirit of this pious man (as if they feared an Ecclips of their Evening ſplendor, by the Day-light of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) have ſome (eſpecially among the Lamps of our Tabernacles) ſpit forth their Venom, in Aſperſions ſo injuriouſly falſe, and palpably abſurd, that neither Reaſon nor Religion, Prudence or Piety, could yield any motive thereunto; only the Monſter of their own frailty. Thus doth the Prince of the Air blind men with ſelf-love; that though in others they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor unrighteouſneſs, yet themſelves can raſhly proceed to ſentence, before they underſtood him, yea ſome of them, before they had read one Leaf in his Writings: VVhereas others that have ſeriouſly ſtudied him, and (with divine aſsiſtance) underſtood much of him, can juſtly as clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the true concordance of his writings, with the word of God in Holy VVrit; and their inconſiſtence with conceited Sects, corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, both of our own and former Ages, and all Heterodox Opinions whatſoever. Well may be ſaid of him, what an experienc'd Philoſopher writeth of <hi>Paracelſus</hi>;</p>

            <p>'Tis true, in reſpect of the common ſtile of moſt Authors, his language may, to ſome, ſeem ſomwhat monſtrous; So do the Characters of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Children, <hi>primo intuitu</hi>; and many, even Scripture expreſſions, to the Ears of the Natural man Beſides, he proceeds much by affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not Diſputing, but Convincing Error; having not received his Knowledge from men, or from the imperfect fallible Principles of the Schools, but from the true Fountain of Wiſdom and Knowledg. Nor did he write, as moſt do, by tranſcription out of other mens Books; nor were his Dictates neither, the Products of his own Fancy, but by Divine influence; and (as is his own expreſſion) out of his <hi>Three-leav'd Book,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:171633:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Hand of God had opened in him: wherein he found the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not only of all that <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught in Sacred Scripture, but of all Myſteries alſo in Heaven and Earth, as himſelf affirms in his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and many other of his writings. But leſt his own Teſtimonie ſhould ſeem invalid, I make bold to inſert what a learned <hi>German</hi> writeth of him.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Now (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) when Reaſon ſuppoſeth that it is aſcended up to the height, with its Wiſdom and Arts, God hath ſtirr'd up this our dear <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi> (a plain unlearned Tradeſman) and gifted him with ſuch a noble endowment of <hi>the Univerſal Knowledge of God and Nature,</hi> and ſhewn him <hi>the Centre of all Beings</hi>; How all things ariſe from God Originally, conſiſt in God, and again return and flow into him <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby to call man to the knowledge of God, of himſelf, and all things; That he might turn from the corrupt Dark being of this World to Chriſt the only Light <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This high, rare, and pretious Gift (which hath not been manifeſted in the like manner and Degree, Height and Depth, Breadth and Length before theſe times) our <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi> learned in God, hath employed in all faithfulneſs and ſimplicity, and lay'd it forth as it was given and imparted to him: And in all his writings hath lay'd his ground in God, and hath reared up his whole Building, very deeply founded, from <hi>Him</hi>: As Chriſt ſpeaketh of the wiſe Maſter-Builder, that <hi>he digged deep, and layd his foundation on a Rock, whereupon he built his Tom'r on High.</hi> As it is clearly to be ſeen how he doth all along, drive and preſs at God, Chriſt, and his Spirit; at Faith and Love; at the mortifying of the old, and the renovation of the new-man; And in brief, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration in Chriſt of God's Image in us, which did diſappear in <hi>Adam</hi>; Alſo he ſheweth the Order, Harmony, and Birth of all things; and how they ſubſiſt by the power of the yet unceſſantly working word of Gods <hi>FIAT,</hi> and hold their Analogy and orderly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the wiſdom of Gods wonders: But he doth not ſet it forth with words of Scholaſtick knowledg, and contrived Art of VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Babel,</hi> and of her Builders; but as it was given him according to the knowledge of Nature, in his own Gift. And though ſuch Tearms and Phraſes as he uſes ſeem hard and harſh at firſt, yet the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of an obſervant Reader, that earneſtly defireth knowledge for his Edification, will (by the indwelling Grace of God) ſo bring him into a right apprehenſion thereof, that what before ſeem'd difficult
<pb facs="tcp:171633:4"/>
and dark, will at length be plain, clear, and eaſy, as it hath hapned to my ſelf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus far his own Country-man and Accquaintance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover he had the knowledge of that wonderfull Myſtery (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Secrets of the whole Creation) <hi>The language of Nature,</hi> and that in his Native tongue; whereby the very name of every thing gave him clear Inſpection into the Nature of it. This Knowledge had <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency, but by his Fall loſt it: Elſe it had been underſtood (as our Author affirmeth) in the Language of every Nation.</p>
            <p>Now to the incredulous, if they could but fathom his depths, I ſhould only bid them ask themſelves this Queſtion; VVhether <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> ever did or can produce ſuch ſublime Knowledge, ſuch pure and diſtinct knowledge of the higheſt Myſteries? knowing that upon debate with their ſerious. Thoughts, they muſt ſpeak the Negative. But there is a malicious Ignorance poſſeſſeth many, by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all things above their, Sphear, and cry down that excellency in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which exceeds the fathom of their own Comprehenſions: I need not travail for Proof or Inſtance, <hi>Iſtorum plena ſunt omnia,</hi> They are no where not to be found.</p>
            <p>Concerning the following Tractate, it contains <hi>Four Tables</hi> with their <hi>Explication</hi>; wherein may be ſeen, by a ſpiritual eye, the Ground and Foundation of all the Authors Works, and profound Myſteries; Yea there is alſo clearly decypher'd, that ſo much ſought, and ſo rarely found Secret <hi>Cabal</hi> of the antient <hi>Rabbies.</hi> Theſe Tables indeed contain the Summe of all the Authors writings, of all his Knowledge, of all in Heaven and Earth, yea of all the higheſt Myſteries that Man, in this life, is capable of knowing.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Table, as the <hi>Radix,</hi> briefly includes the reſt; The other three are Branches of the Firſt, and all together are properly termed an A.B.C. to all that the Author hath written; which when I perceiv'd, I could not but much deſire their publication; and not knowing when or by whom that might be done, I furniſh'd my ſelf with all neceſſaries thereunto; and ſo by God's enablement perform'd it with that care and diligence, which the Majeſty of the matter requires. And though I know it a general Expect, that the skill of a Tranſlator ſhould illuſtrate his Author, yet that, in this and ſome other of his Writings, can not well be done; for whoever (not perfectly baptiſed into his Spirit) ſhall render them in the genuine phraſe of other language, and not punctually <hi>verbatim,</hi> will force his Reader to a double loſs, both in the ſignificancie of expreſſion, and in the mind of the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:171633:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>In a word, this following Tractate I have annexed to the Author's Life, and both, not unfitly, to his <hi>Myſterium Magnum</hi>: For the firſt ten Chapters of that Book, are not only introductory to the following Commentary, but likewiſe an excellent illuſtration of theſe Tables; wherein the pious Reader, by a due ſearch, may happily find (<hi>pulſanti dabitur</hi>) a greater Treaſure than the VVorld can afford, and that to his infinite ſatisfaction; which I heartily wiſh him, together with the Life, Light, and Love of Jeſus Chriſt; In whom I reſt</p>

               <head>A Brief Explication of the firſt Table, of GOD revealed; how out of himſelf he continually begetteth, and breatheth forth himſelf: And how this Table is to be underſtood.</head>
               <p>NUmber 1. Is the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> the <hi>Nothing,</hi> and the <hi>All.</hi> There we begin to conſider, what God in himſelf is, without [or beſides] Nature and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this conſideration of the hidden God, extendeth unto <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> Numb. 7. Therein is underſtood how God dwelleth in all, and how all things from him have their exiſtence; but, himſelf is to all <hi>Incomprehenſible,</hi> and as a <hi>Nothing</hi>; yet through that <hi>All,</hi> he maketh himſelf viſible, ſenſible, and <note n="(a)" place="margin">Invenible <hi>Finditch.</hi>
                  </note> attainable.</p>
               <p>Numb. 2. Is the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Abyſs.</hi> And by it, at the right ſide, FATHER, and on the other ſide, J E. This ſignifieth the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> which is the <hi>Father</hi> of all <hi>Beings.</hi> And the J E ſignifieth the Eternall <hi>One,</hi> as the <hi>Name</hi> JESUS from the Eternall <hi>One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Numb. 3. Is the <note n="(b)" place="margin">Good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Beneplacitum.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Delight</hi> [Lubet] or Impreſſion of the <hi>Will</hi>; by which (towards the right) ſtandeth SON, and oppoſite to it, H O, ſignifying how the ſelf will includeth it ſelf in the place of its poſſeſſion: The place is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation out of it ſelf; where God begetteth God; according to the good pleaſure of his propriety. The HO is the breathing of the will, through which the Delight paſſeth.</p>
               <p>Numb. 4. Is <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Motion:</hi> at the Right ſtandeth SPIRIT, and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it V A. <hi>Science,</hi> is the attraction of the <hi>Will</hi> to the place of God; where the <hi>Will</hi> comprehendeth the Delight which proceeded to the Son, or to the breathing; by which outbreathing is underſtood the Spirit of God. And here is underſtood the great Name JEHOVA, as the <note n="(d)" place="margin">Three <hi>in</hi> one.</note> Tri-une Being; how the Father of himſelf begetteth the Son; and how the Holy Spirit proceedeth from both, and yet they be but one Being, which hath nothing before it. For the <hi>Science,</hi> in the drawing in, is underſtood a Root of the Eternal knowledge, or motion.</p>
               <p>Numb. 5. Is <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Trinity,</hi> ſignifying that the Tri-une Being, may be known, as a Similitude of the <hi>Will, Mind,</hi> and <hi>Senſes</hi>; wherein lyeth the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal underſtanding. Thus is the Ternarie, the one Eternal underſtanding, and cauſe of all things.</p>
               <p>Numb. 6. Standeth WORD, ſignifying diſtinction in the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as ſpeaking, the <note n="(e)" place="margin">Or ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. <hi>Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndlig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keit.</hi>
                  </note> Perception of it ſelf; which word abideth Eternally in God himſelf; and God as the Power of Perception, is the Eternal good.</p>
               <p>Numb. 7. Standeth <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſignifying the outſpoken Word, as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Divine Contemplation; wherein God to himſelf is Intelligible, Perceptible, and Revealed. And thus far is God to the Creature, Inviſible, Incomprehenſible, not Natural, nor Creatural.</p>
               <p>Below the line ſtandeth Beginning of the <hi>Great Myſterie,</hi> or of the <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>; As of the Separability, Perceptibilitie, and Senſibilitie of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; wherein is underſtood, the Divine Extrication or Revelation, how God introduceth himſelf in the eternal Nature, in Love and Wrath; and not in himſelf, for himſelf is the one Eternal good, but without Diſtinction, were not perceptible or manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Here is to be Noted, that the 7. <hi>Capitall Forms of Nature,</hi> are marked (to diſtinguiſh them from the other Numbers) with I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII.</p>
               <p>Numb. 8. The ſecond <hi>Principle,</hi> ſtandeth to the Right. And Numb. 9. The
<pb facs="tcp:171633:6"/>
firſt <hi>Principle,</hi> to the left. Thus Numb. 9. ſignifieth the Fathers Propertie, through the ſpeaking of the Word in Wrath; And the ſecond Numb. 8. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Sons propertie in Love; where the Love of God by the expreſſed Word is revealed. As that in Love, Numb. 8. ſheweth the Angelicall power-world; and that in Wrath, Numb. 9. ſignifieth the Dark power-world of Painfulneſs, wherein God is an Angry God.</p>

               <p>For the egreſs of the Unity, leadeth it ſelf with the I into E, as in the ſight or beholding of a <hi>Chaos</hi>; wherein the <hi>Myſterium magnum</hi> (according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine manner) is underſtood; and is a triple breathing of the powers.</p>
               <p>J E, is the breathing of the Unitie. H O, is the breathing of the J E. V A, is the breathing of the H O, and yet is only one breathing; but maketh a triple egreſs, of the 3.

But that really ſuch power and vertue is therein, may well be underſtood, in the effluence of the world, and the Creatures therein, generated by the breath of God: and there is nothing in the being of this world, which beareth not witneſs thereof, if truly conſidered.</p>

                  <p>As under the figure I. ſtandeth <hi>Deſire</hi> or <hi>Comprehending,</hi> whereby is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the <hi>Deſire</hi> is <hi>Magnetick,</hi> and incloſeth, and darkneth it ſelf, which is alſo the ground of <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal darkneſs,</hi> and from that <note n="(g)" place="margin">Orig.

                  <p>Under number 2. ſtandeth <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Drawing,</hi> which is the ſecond Form to Nature; as the motion of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> attraction, from whence the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Nature exiſteth; and is the <hi>ground of all Contraries,</hi> for <hi>Hardneſs</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are Enemies; Motion breaketh the hardneſs again, and yet alſo begetteth Hardneſs by attraction. Thus two Eſſences have their exiſtence in the deſirous out-flown-will of God; as the drawing of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> power, giveth Motion and Senſibilitie; and the thing attracted affordeth Eſſence; wherein is underſtood the cauſe <note n="(h)" place="margin">Orig. to.</note> of Spirit and Body; as in the attracting of Senſibilitie is cauſed the Spirit; and in the extracted, the body or cauſe to Corporietie. Now if this attraction and Eſſence be not able to reach the <hi>Light</hi> of Gods <hi>Unity,</hi> whereby it may be mollified; then in it ſelf remaineth onely a Meer Enmitie, and is the cauſe of the torment of Fury and ambition: whence exiſteth ſelf-pleaſing, and Pride; for the will of ſelf-pleaſing is a falſe-will, a continuall corruptor of it ſelf, and its Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>And in theſe two Forms, <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>In-drawing,</hi> in their out-flown Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is underſtood Gods <hi>Wrath</hi>; and though they be the ground of the ſenſible life, Yet if the light ſhineth therein, then are they the ground of the Joy-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as an inward motion of Gods Unitie; and a ground of the five Senſes; whence alſo the creatural life hath taken its beginning; and therein ſtandeth its <note n="(k)" place="margin">Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Verterbnus.</hi>
                     </note> corruption, ſo farr as it loſeth the light: for it is the <hi>Spring</hi> of Helliſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of painfulneſs; and is alſo the <hi>Root</hi> of Natural life.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>third ſpace</hi> ſtandeth the <hi>third Form</hi> of Nature called <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> as a ſpiritual <hi>Sulphur-ſource,</hi> according to its <hi>propertie:</hi> This taketh its Ground from the firſt and ſecond Form; as from the <hi>Magnetick Deſire,</hi> and from the Motion of Drawing; where the out-flown Eternal will, in that unquietneſs ſtandeth in Anguiſh. This Anguiſh is the cauſe of Natural Will, Mind, and the Senſes, and is the Wheel of Life, as the cauſe of the Firing-life: for when the out-flown will of Gods Unitie ſtandeth in <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> then it longeth again after Unity, as after Reſt, and the Unity or Reſt longeth after Motion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, for in the Unity there can be no Revelation without Motion; and therfore the Divine will freely floweth out of it ſelf; and the Divine <note n="(l)" place="margin">Lubet.</note> good pleaſure in the out-flown-will, bringeth it ſelf into a Deſire and Motion unto a ſenſibility; that it may perceive it ſelf, and remain two in one Eſſence; as the ſenſible Divine delight, and the cauſe of ſenſibility; wherein God calleth himſelf a Loving God, according to the ſenſibilitie of Divine Love-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and an Angry God according to the cauſe of ſenſibility; as after the
<pb facs="tcp:171633:9"/>
Eternal Nature. And thus, we underſtand by <hi>Anguiſh</hi> (when the divine Light is not revealed therein) the Helliſh fire, and an Eternal deſpair and Terrour: where the Self-will of Nature continually ſtandeth in a dying Torment; ever deſiring to be releaſed from ſuch a condition, which I therefore call the <note n="(m)" place="margin">Little.</note> leſſer Death; it is the Eternal dying Death; but in the Hardneſs, it is the great ſtill-ſtanding Death. This Form if it hath not Light, is the head ſpring of the falſe minde; but if it perceiveth Light in it ſelf, then is it the ſpring and ground of the ſenſible mind, and the right root of fire, as appeareth in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 3. downwards.</p>
                  <p>The fourth <hi>Form,</hi> numb. 4. is the <hi>Fire</hi> of the Eternal Nature; underſtand ſpiritual Life-fire: and that exiſteth from a continual conjunction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of <hi>Hardneſs</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> Underſtand, that thence ariſeth the <hi>Painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; but the <hi>Splendor</hi> exiſteth from the Delight of the <hi>Free-will</hi>; where the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Delight [good pleaſure</hi>] is acuated in the properties; then like a flaſh [<hi>of lightning</hi>] it ſhineth through the continued Conjunction, of the great meekneſs of the Unity, and the <hi>Fierceneſs</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of the three firſt <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; for then it is in the Eſſence of the Conjunction, as if Steel and Stone were rubb'd together; whence the flaſh ariſeth. Such a <hi>Flaſh,</hi> is the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Eternal</hi>; for it is the Revelation of Divine Motion, and hath the properties of Nature; and alſo the Revelation of the Unity of Gods effluence in it ſelf. Now which of theſe two getteth predominancy, in that ſtandeth the Life.</p>
                  <p>The ſplendor of the <hi>Fire,</hi> is the Light from the effluence of Gods Unity; and the Eſſence of the <hi>Fire</hi> is the out-flown will, which hath brought it ſelf with the deſire into ſuch Properties. Thus in the out-flown firy will, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi>; and in the ſenſible ſharpned Lights power from the Unitie, we underſtand the Spirit wherein God is revealed, and underſtood in the ſpiritual eſſence; and in the Fire two Kingdomes ſeparate themſelves, as the Kingdom of Glory from the efflux of Gods Unity, and the Kingdom of the properties of Nature; and yet [theſe two Kingdoms] dwell in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one. The Kingdom of Nature is in it ſelf, that great <hi>Eternal Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but the Light is the Kingdom of God; of which <hi>S John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Light ſhineth in darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</hi> As day and night dwell in one another, and yet the one is not the other.</p>
                  <p>Thus from the Fires own propertie, comes the painful life, if it break it ſelf off from the Eternal Light, and doth (as in the propertie of ſelfhood) enter the object; then is it only fantaſtick and fooliſh; even ſuch as the Devills were, and the Souls of the Damned are; as appears Numb. 4. downwards.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>fift Propertie of Nature,</hi> is the ſecond <hi>Principle,</hi> with its foundation underſtood; as the Eſſence of the Unity in the Light-power) where in the out-flown Unity is a fire-flaming-love underſtood, whence exiſteth the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding-Spirit, with the five Senſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt three <hi>Forms</hi> are only the property to Life; and the fourth is the Life it ſelf; but the fift is the true Spirit. When the fift property is revealed out of the Fire, then ſhe dwelleth in all the reſt, and changeth them all into her ſweet love, that no more painfulneſs nor Enmity is diſcerned, but even as the day changeth the night.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt 4. <hi>Properties,</hi> is that life like the Devills; but when the Lights-power (as the ſecond Principle) is revealed in the property, then is it an Angel, &amp; liveth in divine power &amp; holineſs, as appeareth in the Num. 5. downwards.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt Property, is the Underſtanding, as the <hi>Sound,</hi> where the properties in the Light ſtand all in an equality; then they rejoyce, and the power of the five Senſes is manifeſt, and all the properties rejoyce in one another; and thus the love of the Unity leadeth it ſelf into working, willing, ſenſibility, finding,
<pb facs="tcp:171633:10"/>
and <note n="(n)" place="margin">Highneſs <hi>Hochkeit.</hi>
                     </note> celſitude. Thus is there a contrary in the <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>; that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties exiſting therein, the love is known, and that there might be ſomething, to be beloved, wherein the Eternal Love of Gods Unity may work, and God may be praiſed. For if the properties of life be penetrated with the Divine love-flame, then they praiſe the great love of God, &amp; yield themſelves all again into the Unity of God. Such rejoycing &amp; knowledge could not be revealed in the Unity, did not the Eternal will bring it ſelf into painfull moving properties.</p>
                  <p>The Seaventh Property, is that Eſſence, wherein all the other are eſſential; wherein they all act, as the Soul doth in the Body: wherein the Natural, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, Eternal <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God (as the <hi>Myſterium Magnum)</hi> is underſtood; out of which the viſible World, with its Eſſence and Creatures, did ariſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus by this Table is underſtood the hidden Spiritual world, as the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manifeſtation of God; from whence the Angels and Souls of Men recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their exiſtence; therefore may they turn themſelves to evill or good, for both lie in their Center.</p>
                  <p>This Spiritual world is no other than Gods revealed Word, and hath its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Eternity to Eternity; for therein is Heaven and Hell underſtood.</p>

               <head>An Explanation of the third Table, <hi>MACROCOSMUS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN this Table is underſtood, how the hidden ſpiritual world hath made it ſelf viſible; and with its own breathing forth, hath made it <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gegen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wurff.</note> an object where the Eternal <hi>Principles</hi> are out-flown; and the powers therein became co-mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. For the External Nature is no other than an efflux or object of the Eternal Nature. The 4. Elements exiſt from the firſt 4 Properties of the Eternal Nature; as the Earth and groſsneſs of all Eſſences of the Dark deſire, where the other ſix Properties alwayes became co-material; as we may conceive of Metals and Powers, good and bad. The Air exiſteth from the motion of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> Impreſſion; The Water from the abrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [breaking off] of the Impreſſion, where Heat and Cold are in Strife; the Fire of the ſpiritual fire. The cold is Perceived in the <hi>Magnetick</hi> ſharpneſs, as in the right root to Fire.</p>
               <p>Before the ſeven Properties, above the Table, ſtandeth <hi>Ground of Nature</hi> diſtributed in the three firſt Forms. And in the fourth and fift Form or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, is divided the word <hi>Pure Element.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the word <hi>Ground of Nature,</hi> is underſtood the root of the 4. Elements,<note place="margin">The Pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the Elements; and is called the <hi>Quint-eſſence</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the equality of Nature: both are the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult <hi>Arcanum</hi> ſo much ſought for.</note> as the four cauſes of Motion and Senſibility. By the word <hi>Pure Element,</hi> is underſtood the Temperature, or the equalitie of Nature, and the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; where the Light alſo is ſenſible, Moving, and Elemental. Thus is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, how the Eternal Element, as the motion of Divine Power is accuated by the ground of Nature, and revealed in the Light; where the pure <hi>Element</hi> is the motion of the inward Spiritual world; and at the Creation of the world, went forth into a Being; and is underſtood of the fift <hi>Eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in the 6. and 7. Properties, ſignifieth the ſpiritual work in the Lights Eſſence; as a ſpringing up, or ſpiritual growth, which at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, ſprung up through all the 4. Elements; and out of the Earth formed it ſelf into all manner of fruits, and changed all the properties of wrathfulneſs into a Temperature. But when thoſe fierce properties, with the 4. Elements, were awakned, by the alienated deſire, and falſe will in <hi>Adam,</hi> and attain'd the Dominion, then the Greening [ſpringing forth] retyr'd back; that is, it remayned in the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the inward Ground, and is yet in the 4. Elements, but, in the Inward <hi>Pure</hi> Element only; and may not be attain'd but in the New-birth of the inner man; and in the material <hi>Tincture,</hi> wherein the Paradiſical working is alſo fully manifeſt to our underſtanding.</p>
               <p>This Table ſheweth from whence all Eſſences [or Beings] in this world did ariſe; and what the Creator is; namely that the Creator hath been the divine power-world; which the <note n="(b)" place="margin">Monas</note> Unity, as the Eternal will, hath moved,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Einheit.</hi> God made firſt the Angelical light world, which in this place (after the Devills Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie) ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this external vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eſſence.</note> which will, is God himſelf, But the Separator or Divider, was the owt-flown will in the ſpiritual world; in ſuch motion, he iſſued out of himſelf, and made him a ſubject for his working; in which motion, one ſubject iſſued out of another continually, untill the external matter of the Earth (through the divine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) was drawn into a <hi>Maſs</hi> or <hi>Chaos:</hi> and this drawing of the Motion ſtandeth thus ſtill: all things therefore fall in the deep towards the Earth; and that is the reaſon, that all Power of motion, even to this day, and to the end of Time, continueth ſo.</p>
               <p>The ſeven Dayes, and ſeven Planets, ſignify the ſeven Properties of the ſpiritual world, The three Principle <hi>in Spiritu Mundi,</hi> as <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> ſignifie the Trinity of the divine Revelation; as an everlaſting Spring or Fountain, whereout all external Creatures are flown, do flow, and
<pb facs="tcp:171633:11"/>
will flow, even to the end of this time; and therein the Separator, with the 7 <hi>Properties,</hi> is underſtood. In this Table we ſee what proceeded from the 7 <hi>Properties</hi>; and how the Spiritual power hath brought it ſelf into a Material one (as in the <hi>ſeven ſpaces</hi> downwards appears) whereby we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whence Good and Evill ſprung up in this World.</p>

               <head>An Explanation of the fourth Table. <hi>MICROCOSMUS.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What Man is in his Trinity; as firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to he Spirit of Error; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the New birth, which Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and will have, <hi>John</hi> 3.</note>
               </head>
               <p>IN this Table, <hi>Man</hi> is held forth as a ſimilitude of the Three worlds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Soul, Spirit, and Body; What he hath been in the beginning, according to his Creation; What he is become in the fall, by the Spirit of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and What he will be in the new birth through the Spirit of Chriſt; which is a true Eſſential Image, out of the three Principles of the Divine Revelation; as from the outflown Word of the Divine will.</p>
               <p>Man according to the Soul, is an Eternal Nature of the firing quality, as a ſpark out of the Center, from whence the fire exiſteth: If this ground cannot reach into the divine Light; then is it a Darkneſs of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> attractive deſiring power; but if he reacheth out of the fire, unto the light, that his <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick</hi> deſire feeds on the out flown Unity of Gods Love; then ariſeth from that fire the good true Spirit, even as light ſhineth out of a Candle. Theſe are now two Principles, the <hi>Soul,</hi> in the fire of Eternal Nature; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the light of Divine Power. But the Body is the third Principle; as an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the viſible world, from the Starrs and Elements, formed into an Image, out of the ſeven Properties of Nature.</p>
               <p>The Soul hath the ſeven Properties of the inward Spiritual world,<note place="margin">N. B. The Difference between the Soul, and the Spirit of the Soul which without God, is but a dead Image.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Nature; But the Spirit of the Soul is without theſe Properties; for it ſtandeth out of Nature, in Gods unity but through the Souls firie Nature, is manifeſted in the Soul; for it is the true Image of God; as an <hi>Idea,</hi> in which God himſelf worketh and dwelleth; ſo far as the Soul brings her deſire into God, and ſubmits unto Gods Will: if that be not done, then is this <hi>Idea,</hi> or Spirit of the Soul, dumb and actleſs [not working], ſtanding like an Image in a Looking-Glaſs, which ſoon vaniſheth, and hath no being, as it befell <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall. But if the Soul ſubmits to God, and bringeth its Magnetick hunger into Gods Love, the Soul then attracteth divine Eſſence, namely, the Eſſential Wiſedom of God; then her <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> becometh Eſſential in the Lights power, and obtaineth a pious life; as being then the true Temple of God, wherein Gods Unity is revealed and operative.</p>
               <p>But if the Soul herſelf with her deſire, bring in ſelf-love; and with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire turn herſelf into the ſeven Properties, to try them; and feedeth on the vain delights of the ſeven Properties; then ſhe extolls herſelf, and maketh to herſelf an <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eveſtrum</hi> is a continued Aſtral Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the 4. Elements, and likewiſe, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral Spirit in Man.</note> 
                  <hi>Eveſtrum,</hi> as an Aſtrall Object; which <hi>Eveſtrum</hi> preſently hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth after the vanity of the falſe delight; even as it befell <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> where the <hi>Eveſtrum</hi> of <hi>Lucifer</hi> imagined it ſelf into a <hi>Phantaſie</hi>; and the <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> Soul, into the Animaliſh Properties of the External world; whereby the Soul was poyſoned, and the Body (out of the Earth's <hi>Limus</hi>) was ſuddenly infected; that the Animaliſh properties awakened in him,<note place="margin">How the holy ſimilitude of God in Man became quenched, and a monſtrous Image aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> and longed after Earthly, Beaſtly ſuſtenance; as Heat, Cold, Sharp, Bitter, Sweet and Sour; and with theſe Properties introduced it ſelf into a ſpringing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſuch delights; and ſo with the deſire, <hi>Fed</hi> on <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Image of God,</hi> as the <hi>Idea,</hi> became obſcure and unactive. Thus the true Spirit (as the active <hi>Idea</hi>) became dumb and dead, even as an Image in a Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſs; and ſo was the Soul cut of from God, and ſtood in a Naturall will; but Gods will in the Spirit worked work'd no more; and the will of the <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum</hi> (as the Oppoſite Image of the dark eternal world began [to work], for the holy <hi>Genius</hi> was changed.</p>
               <p>At the head of this Table ſtandeth TINCTUR divided into the ſeven Properties; which ſignifieth the Equalitie of the ſeven Properties according
<pb facs="tcp:171633:12"/>
to the Soul &amp; Body that in the firſt man before the fall, the propertie [or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation] to ſeparation,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie <hi>Annehmlig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keit.</hi>
                  </note> and Acceptation, ſtood in a like will; and all its deſires were brought into Gods Unitie: thus were they the true Paradiſe; for the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Spirit with the Unity of God, was revealed in them, who were to work through Gods love in all things. But the Devill envied them, and with his falſe Luſt deceived the ſeven Properties of life, and perſwaded them, it would be good for them, and they ſhould become wiſe; if the Properties (each one according to its kinde) would introduce themſelves into ſelf-Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, then ſhould the Spirit taſt and know what was Good and Evill: but then it could not ſubſiſt in Gods Unity, of that he told them nothing.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner had they brought themſelves in their own luſts, than ſuch a ſtrife and contention awakned in them, that all the Properties began to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their ſelf-hood.</p>
               <p>Thus the Unity, as the Element, was broken [or divided], and the four Elements ſtrove for predominance; whereupon ſuddenly from without, fell in the Inequality, as <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> and the <hi>Aſtral</hi> diviſion working in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;<note place="margin">Thus was our nature firſt corrupted: which ground was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered.</note> and Gods wrath (according to the Dark worlds propertie) in the Soul; which cauſed in them (according to the Soul), Horror, Anguiſh, Neceſſity, and Eternal deſpair; and in the Body, aroſe Heat, Cold, Woes, Sickneſs and a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. Thus Gods Image, the whole man, fell from his Ordinance; and became a diſguiſed monſter: and the awakened Properties preſently began to ſet up their Government, with Envying, Murthering, Raging, Tearing and Tormenting. Love was changed into Pride and ſelf-love; Deſire, into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; Senſibility, into Envy; and the lifes fire, into wrath: Thus was the Helliſh foundation, in the whole Man, revealed, and ruled both in Soul &amp; Body.</p>
               <p>Now this Helliſh Foundation, is the Spirit of Errour; for which man muſt have been damned, had not the Divine mercy, the Serpent-treader (as the efflux of Gods love) after the fall, been preſently <note n="(c)" place="margin">Origin <hi>is</hi> in-ſpoken.</note> promiſed to the New birth, in the Holy Name Jeſus. Which holy Name hath, in meer mercy, and great humility for mans ſoul &amp; body, given it ſelf forth, aſſumed humanity, broken the power of the diabolical Spirit of Error, killed the lives ſelf-will, &amp; brought again the Properties into Gods Unity. There the true Spirit (as the human <hi>Idea</hi> and Gods <hi>Image)</hi> is renewed again, and filled with the Divine Love-Eſſence. And thus the human Soul, through Chriſts Soul and Spirit in that love and divine Eſſence, hath again attain'd an open Gate unto God.</p>
               <p>Thus in this Table is held forth [or drawn to the life] what <hi>Adam</hi> hath been; what, through the Fall, he is become; and how he is again Redeemed; and what is his New-birth out of Chriſt Spirit.<note place="margin">Souls ground. 1, 2, 3. firſt Princip. Souls Spirit out of God 4, 5, 6. ſecond Princip. the Body. 7. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, now earthly.</note> And theſe are delineated in the ſeven Properties under the Word TINCTUR. In which Properties the Soul hath its <hi>Center,</hi> and in which the Spirit, and in which the Body [have their <hi>Centers</hi> alſo] of which the Reader may further conſider; for under them ſtand the ſeven Dayes of the week, intimating, that Man is even the ſame.</p>
               <p>This Table ſheweth what Man is internally and externally; firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good <hi>Adam,</hi> and then according to the corrupted <hi>Adam</hi>; and alſo what he is again in Chriſt. Whereby, we may underſtand, how Evill and Good is man; and whence exiſt the Propertie of good and evill, both in the mind and ſenſes.</p>
               <p>By the word <hi>Sathan</hi> (ſignifying the Spirit of Errour) is not underſtood a Creaturely-Devill; but the Spring [or fountain] of the Spirit of Error.</p>
               <p>And by the word <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is underſtood the New-Man (according to the internal) in the Spirit of Chriſt. The other ſpaces, are underſtood as in the other Tables; wherein is underſtood the cauſe of mutation.</p>
