            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF we compare our preſent, with all the Circumſtances of our late unhappy condition, by deſcending to a conſiderate recollection of thoſe deſperate Attempts of <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> to violate our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Laws, and to enſlave theſe Kingdoms, by a Deſpotick Invaſion upon our juſt Rights and Properties: we muſt either account it the ſignal effects of a wonderful Providence, or elſe make our <hi>Ingratitude</hi> as great a <hi>Miracle,</hi> as was that of our <hi>Deliverance:</hi> And as we chiefly owe all to that Divine hand, who by his over-ruling influence diſpoſes of Sublunary Affairs, by <hi>turning them which way ſoever he pleaſes;</hi> ſo muſt we ſubordinately to him, aſcribe the preſent Settlement to his <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and the Reſtorer of our Peace, his now Sacred Majeſty. Now as all good men here muſt needs expreſs the happineſs and Tranquillity they enjoy, by acknowledgments of this nature; ſo it may be preſumed, that his <hi>Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Ireland,</hi> are not wanting in a right ſenſe of that affectionate tenderneſs, and regard for their intereſt and preſent condition, which his Majeſty has graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb facs="tcp:62756:3"/>
ſuch evincing Demonſtrations of. For if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any <hi>danger,</hi> does juſtly require a proportionable eſtimate upon the Means conducing to a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from it; then conſequently the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> are by ſo much their more obliged unto higher Teſtimonies of Gratitude, for his Majeſty's Princely Endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtate them in their Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, than were thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> by how much all theſe were in a greater meaſure infringed and now actually and totally violated. But as this is a truth, which (by more than bare Arguments of preſumption) I fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is ſo inſenſible of, as to diſpute, whatever ſome unreaſonable <hi>Male Contents,</hi> and Factious Ill-ſpirited men, fondly attempt to do, that are Inhabitants of this; yet ſeeing His Majeſty has expreſſed ſo much condeſcention, as to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe liberty to ſuch of them as are in <hi>London,</hi> to offer their Reaſons in the framing up of a Proclamation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> it might juſtly be accounted a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying as well of their Majeſties, as of their own intereſt, not to endeavour by lawful methods, a juſt preſervation of both.</p>
            <p>I know it will be difficult for them to avoid a cenſorious imputation of partiality and prejudice, eſpecially by ſuch as are in the bottom diſaffected to them; or rather in the main to the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> how zealouſly ſoever they aſſume the outward ſhape of it. To this ſort of men, the moſt Candid, and Indifferent repreſentation of the preſent Inſurrection of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will be looked upon with an evil Eye, and under ſtood as an effect of Self-Intereſt. Others there are that may miſinterpret their Proceedings, not out of a General Diſaffection to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants,</hi> but becauſe at this diſtance it is impoſſible for them (how intelligent ſoever in matters of State and Government) to be throughly acquainted with the Humour and Genius of
<pb facs="tcp:62756:3"/>
the <hi>Native Iriſh,</hi> of which none (I preſume) can be ſuch Competent Judges as thoſe, who have been long converſant in the Country, and have had the Opportunities of inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting into all their Affairs, and to obſerve how their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Zeal, their inſuperable Cruelty, and averſion to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their Natural Inconſtancy, and Perfidiouſneſs in the breach of Faith, and the moſt Sacred and ſolemn Obligations, which they can poſſibly lie under, or be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in, raiſed and fomented partly by the vileneſs of their Tempers, but chiefly by the inſtigation of their Prieſts, who are the publick Incendiaries of that Kingdom; and whilſt the people are governed by their Arbitrary influence over them, it muſt happen of courſe, that ſuch implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> will poſſeſs their blind and ſlaviſh <hi>Votaries</hi> with a like antipathy, both againſt it, and its Profeſſors: By which 'tis plain, that if they were well inclined, yet lies it not in their power to be true to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Infallible Dictates of their <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other Conſiderations with them. Not to enumerate their other Qualities, I ſhall only add their Dexterous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſneſs under the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (which has been no ſmall Deluſion, and miſchief to the too Credulous <hi>Engliſh)</hi> and their inſupportable <hi>Tyranny</hi> and Inſolence under their own <hi>Government.</hi> We uſually ſay, that Experience is the beſt <hi>School-maſter;</hi> and that an Ocular, and Practical, is preferrable to a remote and ſpeculative knowledge, which being a Maxim, <hi>Non ſolum dato, ſed conceſſo,</hi> as well granted as allowed on all hands, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the <hi>Proteſtant Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are moſt capable of underſtanding its proper conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of propoſing ſuch Expedients, as my produce the moſt durable, as well as <hi>equal</hi> ſettlement of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I ſay, <hi>equal</hi> ſettlement, becauſe though their Sufferings have been ſuch, as may in Juſtice demand a Retribution
<pb facs="tcp:62756:4"/>
from the Invaders of their lawful Poſſeſſions; yet on the other hand, do the Principles of their Religion, as well as natural Clemency and Compaſſion (which their Enemies even in the late Reign, could not but acknowledge, how far ſoever they were from imitating them) reſtrain them from thoughts of Blood, and from a mutual exerciſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the like meaſures of Severity, which have been ſhewn to them, their Profeſſion not allowing them any ſuch Latitude, as <hi>to do evil that good may come of it;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Apoſtle has thought fit to paſs Sentence upon that unlawful Practice, ſo common in, and peculiar to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> by that plain Aſſeveration, that their Damnation is juſt.</p>
            <p>But though both their <hi>Religion,</hi> and, their <hi>Natures,</hi> carry a powerfull propenſion in them to acts of Mercy; yet neither (I ſuppoſe) will debar them from recovering of their own, by having juſtice done upon ſuch, as have violently rent it from them; nor will yet hinder them from taking ſuch juſtifiable, but effectual courſes, as may inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate their Adverſaries to commit the like for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And beſides the common equity, we may draw the reaſonableneſs of the firſt of theſe, from the pungent neceſſity, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are reduced to through the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, and Outrages of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> eſpecially ſuch whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance conſiſted chiefly in <hi>Perſonal Eſtates,</hi> for which if they ſhould have no compenſation from their injurers, ſuch, by conſequence, muſt (notwithſtanding the reduction of that Kingdom) remain in a miſerable, and diſtreſſed, who liv'd formerly in a very opulent, and comfortable condition: And then as to others who have real Eſtates to return to, (tho' they have likewiſe incurred great loſſes in their <hi>Stock,</hi> &amp;c.) yet I perſwade my ſelf, that there are hardly any of them, but would deſire to be diveſted of both, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their preſent <hi>Exile,</hi> under all the hardſhips of an indigent and mean Eſtate, rather than return to their own
<pb facs="tcp:62756:4"/>
with the conditions of a General Pardon, and Indemnity to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> who are ſo <hi>naturally,</hi> I had almoſt ſaid <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> prone to <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as to graſp at the next opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which muſt needs end in the inevitable ruine, and final <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſerious Conſideration upon all which, has by a natural <hi>Sympathy</hi> to my diſtreſſed Countrey-men, as well as out of an hearty <hi>Zeal</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and a due regard to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> incited me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the following Sheets to publick view: for which bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I could expect no pardon, if a matter of ſo univerſal a nature, as is the ſettlement of a Nation, did not with all Candid and Judicious men, give a great allowance to the infirmities of ſo honeſt a deſign. And tho' I heartily wiſh, that ſome more accurate Pen would undertake the Subject, the neglect whereof ſeems to be an unpardonable omiſſion in thoſe, whoſe Learning and Parts entitle them to an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defence both of themſelves, and others in that Kingdom; yet their ſilence in a juncture, and upon an occaſion, which ſo nearly concerns them, if they have a due regard to their Religion, and to a firm and laſting ſettlement of their Country, made me chooſe rather to ſay ſomething, tho' <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently,</hi> than to be wanting altogether to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſo good a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> wherein men of Learned Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of a great intereſt in that Kingdom, are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably defective; excepting that Ingenious Gentleman <hi>Colonel Phillips,</hi> to whoſe Character and Vindication of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Nation ſtands infinitely indebted. Another reaſon to the former, is, in purſuance to a Letter dated from <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and writ to a Friend in <hi>London</hi> upon this occaſion, wherein I promiſed a larger Diſcourſe; and to make my word good, have adventured upon the following Tract; in which the Reader will find the ſubſtance of that Letter, together with many other ample, and additional Improvements, the deſign whereof (to repreſent it in a
<pb facs="tcp:62756:5"/>
word) is to ſhew how improper it is to vouchſafe a Pardon to the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reduce the Populace to Obedience; but that the quite contrary, is the beſt method, as well for a ſafe and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as for a ready and expeditious Conqueſt of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I will detain you no longer in the <hi>Porch,</hi> but ſend yon to the <hi>Main Work</hi> in the enſuing Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

This (though deſign'd as an effect of tranſcendent Mercy) is a moſt inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Grievance to the Proteſtants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not to them peculiarly, but to <hi>England</hi> alſo, if rightly and duly reflected upon.</p>
            <p>But that this is not <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to evince by the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, by aſſerting, That ſo unaccountable has the <hi>Antipathy</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ever been towards the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that thoſe commonly inviolable Bonds both of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> (which we find ſo operative in other Nations) and with which they were link'd together, were not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it.</p>
            <p>That even when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were earneſtly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by their own Kings, to vouchſafe their aſſiſtance, and preſented them with Victory over their Enemies and Competitors; yet at the ſame time, by ſuch a monſtrous Ingratitude, (as 'tis hard to conceive hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature to be guilty of) were barbarouſly aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by thoſe <hi>Savages,</hi> to whom they had procured Deliverance.</p>
            <p>But a better inſtance cannot be given of that radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and unalterable Prejudice, which they bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than its continuance by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted hereditary Succeſſion or lineal Deſcent from <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Son,</hi> ever ſince the firſt footing of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> in that Kingdom; and therefore, as a terrour to their Children, when they would frighten them, they are wont to uſe this Iriſh expreſſion, <hi>Hoot-a-Saſonought;</hi> the meaning whereof is, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are coming; by which means their Children
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62756:6"/>
               <hi>ſuck</hi> in, together with their Milk, a natural averſion to them. So eſſentially true is that expreſſion, <hi>Odiunt quos metuunt:</hi> Thoſe whom Men fear, ſuch they hate; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature being impatient under Superiors, and by a powerful inſtinct of ſelf-love, apt to convert their eſteem of, into hatred againſt ſuch perſons whom they are not able to govern and controul; but rather whoſe high Power and Intereſt they look upon as dangerous to the repoſe both of themſelves and others. And as this Principle is true in it ſelf, ſo has it been carefully inſtill'd by the <hi>Iriſh Parents,</hi> into their Children, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly cheriſhing and improving all the outward ſymptoms of their diſlike to the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> againſt which, as they uſe their utmoſt endeavours to embitter and prepoſſeſs them, ſo are their <hi>Prieſts</hi> as active to ſowre and corrupt their Judgments, with wild and terrifying notions of the Falſhood and Hereſie of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> pronouncing the ſevereſt <hi>Anathemaes</hi> of eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to all that profeſs it, and repreſenting to them, That they are without the <hi>Pale</hi> of the Church, and to be treated as common Enemies to the <hi>Faith;</hi> That they are no otherwiſe to be accounted of than as Dogs and Caſtaways, or a ſort of infernal Spirits, which are ſent into their Country, to inflict a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their Bodies, and for a trial of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the Religion of the Holy Church: But that God will in his due time give them the victory over them, and that then they will do God good Service that are moſt inſtrumental in their deſtruction. Theſe daily and repeated ſuggeſtions of the Prieſts, which operate upon their <hi>Votaries</hi> by a laſting and deep Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, have (together with the <hi>leaven'd</hi> Principles of a byaſs'd and partial Education derived from their Parents) eſtabliſhed ſuch a <hi>fundamental</hi> hatred in their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62756:7"/>
minds againſt any thing that bears the <hi>Stamp</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> that whenever by their Rebellion they wreſted the <hi>Reins</hi> of Government from them, their implacable rage did not only extend to their innocent perſons, but to every <hi>Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Inanimate Subſtance</hi> that bore but the Characters of their Improvement. And to me it ſeems an unparallel'd inſtance of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable inveteracy, thus to deſtroy the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects of the Engliſh Induſtry, when no other way remain'd of executing their inhumane fury, tho' at the ſame time they thereby defac'd the beauty and ornaments of their Country, and conſequently acted diametrically contrary to their own true Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But, alas! this averſion was ſo deeply rooted by the aforeſaid Artifices, conſiſting in the Education of their <hi>Parents,</hi> and Inſtructions of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that no acts of Clemency or Indulgence were ever found capable to prevail with them to adhere faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the Government and Crown of <hi>England;</hi> no, not the higheſt Titles of Honour or Dignity; not their Matrimonial Alliances with the Engliſh; not the largeſt Priviledges or Immunities from the Crown; not the greateſt places of Truſt, or moſt weighty Employments in the <hi>State;</hi> not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt opportunities of Advantage, or of ſecular profit: and in fine, not any Encouragements which were either in the power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to beſtow, or of them to accept, could induce them to extinguiſh that Hatred in their <hi>Breaſts,</hi> which upon all inviting occaſions they executed upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon all their Obligations and Civilities by a moſt horrid Ingratitude and an inſolent Contempt; and that <hi>Humanity,</hi> which in the very Breaſt of a <hi>Cannibal</hi> would claim ſome Power, ſeem'd ſo quite <hi>eras'd</hi> out of their Hearts in all their outrages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62756:7"/>
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as if their <hi>Cruelties</hi> had quite <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mann'd</hi> them, and (as it were) ſunk their <hi>erect</hi> into a <hi>ſavage Shape</hi> of <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Tygers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the gratifying of their <hi>Luſts</hi> was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of that prevalence with their <hi>Grandees,</hi> that to anſwer their importunity they were neceſſitated to enter into <hi>Marriage</hi> with Engliſh Families, in whoſe beauty and humour, though 'twas impoſſible for them not to manifeſt very great Complacency; yet were not their <hi>Amours</hi> to the Children ſufficient to reſtrain their <hi>Barbarity</hi> from the Parents: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as unnatural to others, as peculiar to theſe Monſters; and ſhould I undertake to enumerate the <hi>Tragedies</hi> committed by them, upon ſuch whoſe near <hi>Relations</hi> they had taken to their own <hi>Beds,</hi> all Mankind muſt needs conſider their unequal'd inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity with horror and amazement. But I refer the Reader to the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he may meet with an abundant variety of places to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, together with thoſe various <hi>Tragick Scenes</hi> of ſuch bloody Maſſacres and impious Aſſaſſinations, as no Story can parallel for the matter, nor <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf contrive more Butcherly Arts in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their execution. But I ſhall not inſiſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon theſe things, which are but too lively <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed</hi> in the <hi>Memories</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtant Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;</hi> but rather proceed to my preſent deſign, which is to ſhew,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Lenity</hi> to them, however it carries the face of Mercy, is yet in reality the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>And in the ſecond place, That it will not attain the end deſign'd, the more eaſie reduction of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62756:8"/>In relation to the firſt of theſe, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, That <hi>Mercy,</hi> in its true and genuine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, is a Work of Deliverance and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and whereſoever it is vouchſafed, a chief regard is to be had to the <hi>Security</hi> of Men's <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Intereſts.</hi> Now 'tis plain, That pardoning of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> cannot be capable of any ſuch Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs it be granted, That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been Uſurpers of their Rights.</p>
            <p>'Tis but too apparent, That the preſent <hi>Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> has waſted and deſtroyed the whole Kingdom; That thouſands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have either become <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to the Rage and Cruelty of the Natives, or elſe have periſh'd by Famine or other Diſaſters. If then it be demanded, Who were the <hi>Agents</hi> of this publick Miſchief and Calamity? Was not all of it tranſacted by the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> That is a Truth which admits of no diſpute. But if it be again ask'd, Were not the Natives irritated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by provocations receiv'd from the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> This indeed may be controverted by ſome who are <hi>Foreigners</hi> to the State of that Kingdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it fit to return an Anſwer to that Objection, by taking a ſhort Survey of the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> immediately before this univerſal Devaſtation committed by the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was ſeated at the Helm, a bitter and implacable Enemy to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Militia,</hi> all compos'd of Engliſh, had for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time before been diſarmed.</p>
            <p>The ſtanding Army, made up of Engliſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, disbanded; and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> both <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>private Souldiers,</hi> preferr'd to their places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corporations</hi> diveſted of their old <hi>Charters,</hi> and then new modell'd by turning out the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>

and placing <hi>Natives</hi> of the Kingdom in the Magiſtracy and Government of them.</p>

            <p>The Houſes of the Sick invaded both by <hi>Seculars</hi> and <hi>Regulars,</hi> who would violently ſhut the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doors againſt their own <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and by a Thouſand impious contrivances and unheard-of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, ſo <hi>menace</hi> and terrifie them with the thoughts of <hi>Damnation</hi> to thoſe of their Religion, as forced them in the <hi>agonies</hi> of Death to renounce the Principles of their <hi>Faith;</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> pretended that they did ſo, and that they came off <hi>Conquerors,</hi> the known and apparent refuſal of many notwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hſtanding.</p>
            <p>This tranſient Proſpect of Affairs does ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover to us, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were under no hard or ſevere circumſtances from the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and far from ſtanding in awe of them, who (now that the courſe of things was ſo manifeſtly inverted) were become their <hi>Maſters,</hi> inſtead of that of their <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Vaſſals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps it may be urged, That the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> were for eſpouſing the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> then Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> And indeed, 'twas rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to be ſuppoſed, that all perſons who had any valuable regard for their Religion, or to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving of the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Land, were ſtrongly inclined to favour and aſſiſt in ſo good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62756:9"/>
and advantagious a <hi>Deſign.</hi> But then, alas! the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in no capacity of putting their good Wiſhes in execution: They had been diſarm'd, and thereby diveſted of all ability whereby to make any conſiderable defence, or to provide for their <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Beſides, they were under a ſtrict Guard from their Enemies, who had all the power and ſtrength of the Kingdom in their hands, and kept a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and an attentive eye upon all their actions: which kept the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo much in ſubjection, and was ſo great a diſcouragement unto them, that hardly any attempted to declare for the <hi>Prince,</hi> till <hi>February;</hi> whereas moſt of the Rapin and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation was committed before.</p>
            <p>This compendious deſcription of Affairs will (I preſume) be deem'd ſufficient to ſatisfie all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and impartial men, that without the leaſt provocation or plauſible pretence of Right, the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> have acted the late <hi>Maſſacres, Burnings,</hi> and other publick Miſchiefs and Calamities upon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> which if they had been mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and reciprocal injuries, though they that were in a good <hi>Cauſe,</hi> would have been Sufferers for their Loyalty and Service to the King; yet on the other hand, there might have been room for the King's Mercy. But where the inveteracy of a malicious Antagoniſt diſcharged it ſelf in whole Vollies upon a quiet and inoffenſive People, without any other inducement than that of a bare Surmiſe, that they were inwardly affected to King <hi>William;</hi> ſeems as irrational and unjuſtifiable an Argument for thoſe violent <hi>Outrages</hi> committed thereupon; as 'tis hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without <hi>Precedent</hi> (if duly reflected upon in all its circumſtances and reſpects) that men ſo <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated</hi> to Rebellion, and profeſs'd Enemies to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62756:9"/>
               <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vouchſafed unto them.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſhew, That a Pardon to the Iriſh cannot properly be interpreted an effect of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but in reality the contrary.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this to you, I think it reaſonable to affirm, That that cannot be accounted an effect of <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is extended to ſuch Criminals as have invaded and uſurped the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>others;</hi> which is conſequent to my firſt Poſition, That <hi>Mercy</hi> is to be confin'd within the Boundaries of common <hi>Right:</hi> and if this were not ſo, ſuch as live moſt obedient to the Government, could expect no Security from it; which would be a <hi>Practice</hi> as diſagreeable to the firſt <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Government in the World, as 'tis contrary to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and the common Reaſon of Mankind. Beſides, by this means no Government could long ſubſiſt, becauſe it muſt neceſſarily encourage ſuch men as openly violate and contemn its Injunctions; and by conſequence, ſuch as moſt trample upon, muſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the places of <hi>Judicature,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> become <hi>prime Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to encounter this Argument more cloſely, 'Tis a <hi>Maxim</hi> receiv'd among <hi>Princes,</hi> To manage with a ſteady and equal hand in Affairs of State, and in conſequence hereunto a general Pardon is reckon'd to be a <hi>mutual</hi> Good. But in purſuance to this (I preſume) it will be granted, that ſuch as have adher'd to the Intereſt of King <hi>William,</hi> and conſequently have, upon all occaſions, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated their Zeal and Sincerity for the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> may reaſonably put in as juſt a claim to his Mercy, as ſuch who have declared their Enmity to both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62756:10"/>The Juſtice and Equality of this matter being thus conſidered, it is not to be ſuppos'd, that he who came to reſcue our ſelves and the Reformed Religion from the violent Intruſion of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Slavery, would transfer our Poſſeſſions to thoſe whoſe Injuſtice he came to puniſh and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. This ſeems to be an Act of greater ſeverity than was that precipitate and haſty judgment of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Mephiboſheth, Let Ziba and thou divide:</hi> for in this caſe the Iriſh are in poſſeſſion of the whole, and are ſo far from making any Overtures, or ſhewing any Indication of their Submiſſion, that they have not ſo much as the Argument of that unworthy <hi>Sycophant</hi> on their ſides, meeting the King on the way. Nay, ſo far have they deviated from the leaſt of that Reſpect which is even owing to a Chriſtian, that in their common Diſcourſes they curſed the very name of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> as the Off-ſpring of that man who was ſo fatal to the Romiſh Church in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which they feared, was an ominous preſage of his Poſterity's being ſo to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And if their inveterate malice againſt the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any addition, they augmented it; for the Affection which was viſibly diſcernable in them, to his now Sacred Majeſty, whoſe Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> have in ſo great an Abhorrence, and do, with the moſt impious Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themaes, ſo inhumanly execrate and revile, that we may juſtly account their malice not inferiour to that of the Jews to our Saviour, in ſcourging his <hi>Effigies,</hi> as a meritorious Act in their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But I would not be underſtood in this place, as if the Tenour of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor do the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> deſire the Blood of any, the <hi>Principles</hi> of whoſe Religion, as well as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62756:11"/>
natural Clemency, being ſuch as permits them not to repay their Adverſaries in their own Coin; but to chuſe rather to leave them to God, and the King's Juſtice.</p>
            <p>That which they would pray and intreat for, is only that which might be a means of preſerving thoſe, who have eſcaped the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cruelty, as to their Lives, though not in their Eſtates: Namely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Some have urged His Majeſty's Proclamation of <hi>Pardon</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as an Argument to infer the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and neceſſity of the like to be extended to the Rebels in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but 'tis plain to me, that an Inſtance of ſo great diſparity, inſiſted upon by men of underſtanding, ſerves but to confirm the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and Opinions of many in that, which 'tis not my buſineſs here to mention: Only this I will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That it ſeems not to be chargeable upon our Prime Miniſters of State, but upon a ſmall Fry that hope to fat themſelves in the Troubled Waters of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are not unacquainted with the Humour and Diſpoſition of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and how ſubject they are to bribe, when reduced to any Exigency: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are very unwilling at preſent to diſpoſſeſs <hi>them</hi> of that Wealth, which by Rapin and Spoil they have gained from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> to the intent that it may be

            <p>But to return, It ſeems eaſie to anſwer that Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Proceedings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which in no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances or Reſpects, run parallel with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rebellion of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

            <p>Nay, to come nearer to them, even their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment iſſued out Proclamations for reſtraining their inhumane violence: Though 'twas plain, that this was only a pretence of Juſtice, there being no effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſe taken to bring notorious Offendors to the leaſt, not to ſay, condign Puniſhment, but were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecretly animated, and encouraged in their Villanies by their Gentlemen, and Grandees.</p>
            <p>But to come to a period, as to this Affair of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they are a People of the ſame Nation, united in one common intereſt; nay, and in Religion too, as to the main and eſſential part of it: and his Majeſties Pardon, when graciouſly vouchſafed to ſuch, may be interpreted to be of an univerſal influence, and extent, becauſe it comprehends as well Friends as Enemies, by reaching to thoſe Relations which are general among
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62756:12"/>
them, and ſo in a manner including all; beſides, what theſe Rebels did, was by vertue of a pretended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſo their oppoſition, and acts of Hoſtility, may come under the Conſtruction of a War, and in that reſpect more proper for pardon.</p>
            <p>Whereas the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (not to enumerate Particulars, or to aggravate matters, which are notorious enough in themſelves) can lay claim to none of theſe Reaſons, in all which they are utterly Foreign, and bear no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now deſcend to a recital of thoſe Reaſons, which ſeem of force to perſwade any unprejudiced and impartial man, That a General and Free Pardon will not attain the end deſigned, the ſpeedy Reduction of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We that by ſad and lamentable experience are fully acquainted with the Humour and Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that Kingdom, are none of us ignorant that Arts of Mildneſs and Indulgence, are not proper means to diſpoſe them to obedience; the more that they are careſſed, or favoured, the more rough, and intractable they appear to be: and all the Civilities, or acts of kindneſs, which have, or can be ſhewn to them, do but ſerve to heighten their Inſolence, and Ingratitude, inſtead of begetting in them any hearty Affection, or eſteem. That this is an Impartial, as well as Practical, and not a Malicious, or Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Notion of the evil temper, and vile Diſpoſition of this people, as well their former, as their late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy carriage towards thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had been moſt obliging to them, is a demonſtrative, and an infallible proof; by which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are now (though too late) convinced, that in this, they nearly reſemble their Bogs, which are never to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62756:12"/>
truſted to by going gently over, but the only ſafety is by cutting your way to the bottom.</p>
            <p>If any Propoſals be made to them either in War, or Peace, they immediately draw this favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from it to themſelves, That they are looked upon as very formidable, and conſiderable; That they are of the ſtronger ſide, and upon that account will never reſolve to ſubmit: I want not Inſtances which I could recount of this preſent Rebellion, of divers Gentlemen, who applied to ſome of the <hi>Iriſh Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi> for their protection, upon aſſurance of former Friendſhip, (which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are as profuſe in the Expreſſions, as they are perfidious in the diſcharge of) and to that, they added promiſes of making ſuitable Retribution, to whatſoever acts of favour ſhould be ſhewn to them; but inſtead of meeting with a return of kindneſs from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Civilities done to them, and their repeated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of them, with moſt vehement Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of a ſincere Friendſhip, might have made it reaſonable for them to expect) were entertained with Inſultings, and vile Expreſſions of Reproach, and Contempt.</p>
            <p>Again, I cannot ſee, how a General Pardon will affect them to a ſuitable ſubmiſſion, or to a laying down of their Arms, it will rather make them more obſtinate in their Rebellion, which I gather from the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be an Argument on our ſide, to haſten the Conqueſt, for fear of aſſiſtance from the <hi>French,</hi> or of our other <hi>Embroils;</hi> this ſeems to give equal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to hold out, in expectation of thoſe Advantages ſo favourable to their intereſt. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Underſtanding and Courage is obſerved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62756:13"/>
to be by themſelves underſtood, and depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Negatives: The Enemy, ſay they, are afraid of us; therefore they know, we are wiſe in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſtrong in Arms; if not, they would never offer ſuch terms to us. 'Tis a Maxim received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, <hi>Never bid firſt;</hi> and they deduce this Conſequence from it, <hi>That he's on the weaker ſide who does.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commonalty of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are born up in this Rebellion by the aſſurances they have from their Prieſts, of being relieved by <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes: That the common Intereſt of their Holy Church and Religion, will oblige them to it: That the preſent Differences betwixt them and the <hi>French</hi> will be compos'd by the next Pope; there being nothing more common than for every Infallible Vicar of Chriſt, to act Diametrically contrary to his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; as being generally of another Intereſt, ſwayed by different Principles, and governed by new Maxims and Policies of State.</p>
            <p>To this they add, That 'tis impoſſible for <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes</hi> to joyn with <hi>Hereticks</hi> to maintain the Intereſt of an Uſurper, who is ſuch an open and profeſs'd Enemy to their Church, in oppoſition to Saint <hi>James,</hi> whom they ſtyle, <hi>the Confeſſor,</hi> and doubt not to ſee him triumphant over the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of <hi>Europe:</hi> Theſe and the like, are the uſual Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Prieſts, which they artfully inſtil into the Common People.</p>
            <p>Now what can more effectually confirm them in the belief of this opinion, than to offer them more than they can ask, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a Pardon for Life and Eſtate, together with the enjoyment of all they had before the Rebellion; and not only that, but what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62756:13"/>
they have violently got ſince by Robbing and Pillage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> have not been ſhie in their frequent Diſcourſes, That if they miſcarried in this attempt, the Requital muſt be ſuch as to put them beyond all expectation of another Opportunity: For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that what they did, proceeded not from any provocation given them by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> nor could they have any pretence (the Government being wholly veſted in themſelves) whereas in the former Rebellion they wanted not matter of Complaint, for which Reaſons they owned, That they could not think of Mercy, if that proved an Abortive, which they were labouring with all their might to bring forth to ſuch perfection as to ſecure, and perpetuate to themſelves the <hi>Catholick</hi> Intereſt, and Religion, all which is agreeable to their Motto, <hi>Now, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; now, and for ever.</hi> And to confirm them in their Opinions in this matter, take the following brief account of their Actions.</p>
            <p>Their Lords, and Clergy, put the Populace upon the moſt Violent and Irregular Courſes, telling them, That they muſt now truſt to their <hi>Musket</hi> and <hi>Skene;</hi> for their Actions have been ſuch, as left no room for a Pardon from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and purſuant to this, there is ſcarce a Private Soldier, but will tell the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that they expect no mercy, as being conſcious to themſelves, that they have left nothing undone that could provoke, or diſoblige the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if after all this, they be Courted and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to, before a Blow is ſtruck by the King's Army, which is ſent over; they will be ſo far from making a right uſe of this Indulgence, that it will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62756:14"/>
only raiſe their Scorn, and puff them up with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and Ambition, equal to that of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Victory: For however his Majeſty in great mercy and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nderneſs of Chriſtian Blood, may make Propoſals to them; yet their Earthy, and Slaviſh Nature, is ſuch, as will induce them to believe, that nothing but fear of them, begets thoſe tenders of Pardon and Mercy, and whilſt they are prepoſſeſſed with Apprehenſions of ſo baſe a a Compoſition, and Alloy, offers of Indemnity to their Grandees, is to them Huzza's of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>The next Reaſon in maintenance of my opinion, is, that giving Pardon to all that lay down Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be a means to enlarge the War: For no doubt the Generality of Men of Eſtates will make their ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Engliſh Government,</hi> but this outward compliance will only render them the more uſeful to their own Party, both in reſpect of giving them Intelligence, and Advice, and of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with Money, which they may receive out of their Eſtates in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters, and their Friends out of that in the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems a vulgar, and dangerous errour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that taking away the Men of Eſtates from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> will be a means of obliging the reſt to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, whereas it rather portends the quite contrary, and I'm really of opinion, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nothing beyond having them in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>This renders them formidable in the opinion of their own Party, that they ſhould be ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſortifies the Commonalty with an Aſſurance,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62756:14"/>
that when matters are come to the worſt, they can have recourſe to a Pardon.</p>
            <p>This may be deemed a Maxim of War calculated for the World of the Moon, that upon a Rebellion, the men of Eſtates, and Leaders into it, as ſoon as they have formed an Army and headed them, till they had ſeized upon all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſtates, ſhould then be invited to Pardon, and thereby be capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to attend, not only the preſent ſucceſs of this, but of another Rebellion: which as it has been a practice too frequently purſued in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conqueſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as its fatal Conſequences have but too fully evinc'd; ſo is it matter of Aſtoniſhment, and Admiration to ſee the ſame meaſures re-aſſumed in the preſent juncture</p>
            <p>This ſeems an Invitation to them to Rebel, to vouchſafe a pardon to ſuch, by whoſe influence and example the inferiour ſort have been prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and inſtigated to it: For the Rabble are not capable of making an head, but by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and direction of their Superiors; but when once they are gathered into a body, they are then more eaſily managed, and commanded without them: And 'tis doubtleſs a ſignal advancement to their common intereſt and deſign, to protect, and preſerve them 'till the next opportunity preſents, of making another attempt.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, it appears to be much more reaſonable, to believe, that the pardoning the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, and excluding their Commanders, would be a more expeditious Expedient whereby to obtain the Kingdom: For though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Heads of their <hi>Clans</hi> influence the Common People, whilſt the Lands, and Herds follow them, yet that homage, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62756:15"/>
ceaſeth of courſe, when they are diveſted of both. This common experience evinceth to be true, by ſhewing how careleſs and unnatural the vulgar <hi>Iriſh</hi> are to their Grandees, when they find it their intereſt not to adhere to them.</p>
            <p>This would quickly receive a Demonſtration, if a Proclamation were iſſued forth, extending only to Private, and Inferiour men, or at leaſt to none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the degree of a Captain.</p>
            <p>Before the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Acceſſion to the Crown, men rarely heard the poorer ſort ſpeak of their Old Lords, but with ſad Complaints, that they had ever been the occaſion of their ruin; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they now do, proceeded more from a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Foreign aid, than any Confidence they placed either in their <hi>Chieftians,</hi> or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</p>
            <p>And if now an Experiment were made, which they would adhere to, whether their <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Landlords? This would no longer remain a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for they are by ſo much the more ſenſible of the great advantages derived to them from the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Government, by how much they are poſſeſſed with a deep ſenſe and apprehenſion of their preſent Sufferings, under their own, or rather <hi>French Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> when the <hi>Engliſh Farthing</hi> is become their <hi>Sixpence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not rational for Men to adhere to ſuch as are in no capacity, either of ſecuring themſelves, or their Dependants: Separate them from the opinion of Foreign Aſſiſtance, and they will ſoon deſpair of their own Strength, and forſake their <hi>Grandees;</hi> but to reduce them by pardoning their <hi>Lords,</hi> is (if it ſhould take) the only way to fix
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62756:15"/>
them perpetually to them, and ſuggeſt to them an opinion, that they are very conſiderable abroad in their <hi>Foreign Alliance;</hi> or elſe, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not make court to them at home, when they are at their Devotion, and lie at their mercy, as now they muſt be own'd to do.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the bringing in the common People by their <hi>Lords,</hi> is to make them own their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to them, and conſequently to be under a ſtricter and more indiſpenſable obligation of <hi>homage</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> to them, than formerly; which (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) would be a thing neither honourable nor ſafe.</p>
            <p>The ordinary People have no inclination to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, no, not ſo much as removing from one Province to another. Let them but enjoy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of returning to their <hi>Cabins,</hi> and of living quietly under the protection and ſecurity of the <hi>Engliſh Laws</hi> and Government, and they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to have made a very good and advantagious exchange.</p>
            <p>Thus having, in general terms, deſcribed the preſent conſtitution and circumſtances of the Iriſh, I ſhall now deſcend to particulars, and firſt look back into their ancient forms and modes of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> before the arrival of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that Kingdom, which nearly reſembled that of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> though not ſo regular: for their chief regard was to the Power and Force of him that govern'd, not to the Right of Succeſſion; it was enough, if he were of the ſame <hi>Family,</hi> whether <hi>Brother</hi> or <hi>Son. Elder</hi> or <hi>Younger,</hi> and in proportion to theſe wild <hi>Maxims,</hi> they enjoyed their Eſtates. He that was accounted the moſt Warlike, or more truly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62756:16"/>
moſt barbarous, the reſt of the Family ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Savage Cuſtom</hi> prevailed upon them till the coming of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe preſence among them gave ſome check to it; yet could never be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, till the <hi>Engliſh Laws</hi> and Government were eſtabliſhed in their Country, which to this day (notwithſtanding their preſent Uſurpation) they cannot but acknowledge to be an Happy <hi>Conqueſt;</hi> but though the advantages of it be great to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet there are many of them ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prepoſſeſt in favour of their former <hi>Confuſion,</hi> or rather in prejudice to their preſent <hi>Change,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe done by the Engliſh, as to wiſh again for their <hi>Onions</hi> and <hi>Garlick</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize the beſt Reform'd amongſt them, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the <hi>Engliſh Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Reſtraints</hi> upon a <hi>Free People,</hi> as they accounted themſelves, when indeed they were but <hi>Slaves</hi> to their own <hi>Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtuff Paper with what our Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Hiſtories of <hi>Ireland</hi> relate, as to the Title and Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to that Kingdom, nor repeat the <hi>Treaſure</hi> of Blood and Coin it has coſt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it under the <hi>Engliſh Government;</hi> but ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that it never continu'd ſo long without a Deluge of Blood, as in the late <hi>Calm</hi> and peaceable <hi>Interval,</hi> ſince the <hi>War</hi> of Forty One, which was not ended till Fifty Three, nor the Kingdom ſetled till Sixty Three. So that by a proper computation, it was not perfectly quiet in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants</hi> above Twenty Two years; for we muſt commence the date of our <hi>Troubles</hi> in that Kingdom from the Late <hi>King</hi>'s aſcending the <hi>Throne.</hi> This is then but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62756:16"/>
a ſhort <hi>Reſt</hi> of Twenty two years for that deſolate Kingdom, (tired with the long fatigues of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant War, and almoſt all its <hi>Britiſh Veins</hi> quite emptied of <hi>Proteſtant Blood</hi>) and yet the longeſt and moſt profitable that ever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> enjoy'd there, much of which is attributed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who thought it a diminution to his Honour, to condeſcend to any terms with ſo baſe an Enemy; and had not the Intereſt of their <hi>Patron,</hi> the late King, prevailed in the Settlement of that Nation, but leſt them in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were found in at the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the <hi>Second, Ireland</hi> had been in the greateſt Tranquillity of any of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and conſequently an entire Intereſt for our <hi>Deliverer,</hi> His preſent Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It is now a matter deſerving our conſideration, Whether that Kingdom, as it remains in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> hands (whether by both or either united) it can be reaſonably ſuppos'd to with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtand His Majeſty's Forces and Subjects in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In order to which, firſt reflect upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as to their Commanders; and ſecondly, as to their Troops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to their Commanders; Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they boaſt of ſome few Colonels, and inferiour Officers, yet they cannot nominate one Man that ever actually did or can Command a <hi>Field.</hi> Their great Captain <hi>Juſtin Mac Carthy</hi> might be as good in a <hi>Cellar</hi> as any General in <hi>Europe;</hi> but in a <hi>Field</hi> (as the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſaid of him, when he was ſent to him) his <hi>Army</hi> muſt not be commanded by <hi>Glaſs-Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62756:17"/>Their <hi>Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers</hi> being thus mean, their <hi>Troops</hi> are next to be conſidered, and they perchance in the general, are the moſt abject wretches in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> taken by force from the <hi>Spade</hi> and <hi>Cabin,</hi> who by Blows and continual Inſtruction, were brought to handle their Arms, but not one in ten can fire a <hi>Muſquet</hi> without <hi>ſhut eyes</hi> and a <hi>trembling hand.</hi> I ſpeak not this at randome, or by hear-ſay, but upon good grounds. 'Tis true, their <hi>Horſe</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but yet we have had a demonſtration of their behaviour and all their actions in the <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a true Character of their own <hi>Force,</hi> their dependence muſt be upon the <hi>French Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> to ſupply theſe Defects; but how that ſuits with the Iriſh Intereſt and Deſign is not difficult to imagine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh Gentry</hi> (for I muſt ſay that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People deſire not <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) put themſelves upon this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> not ſo much out of a Loyal Adherence to their <hi>King,</hi> as to be free <hi>Lords of the Soil,</hi> and are now under no predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, if they are capable by their own ſtrength to continue their Deliverance, otherwiſe they had better be under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mild Government than the <hi>French</hi> Arbitrary Power, whoſe cruel <hi>Tyranny</hi> to his native Subjects affords no Invitation or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to others, to put themſelves under it.</p>
            <p>By this ſhort Enquiry, it ſeems plain, That the preſent poſture of <hi>Affairs</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are not in ſo good a <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> as to entitle thoſe wretched Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to demand <hi>terms,</hi> but rather to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon and acquieſce in the King's <hi>Mercy;</hi> and that to deſcend to Capitulations with them, much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62756:17"/>
more to give their Leaders Pardon, is to <hi>encourage</hi> and <hi>revive</hi> a running Enemy.</p>
            <p>If then it be granted, That they are not in a capacity to oppoſe the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and that one Fourth of the Kingdom is already in the actual poſſeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the beſt of the Iriſh Forces loſt, and that many of them living have laid down their Arms. This being premiſed, the next thing to be conſidered, is, What Motives there are for giving Pardon to their <hi>Chief Commanders,</hi> and thoſe which are inſiſted upon are two.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That by giving a General <hi>Pardon,</hi> the Kingdom will be the ſooner gain'd.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, That a <hi>Pardon</hi> will preſerve the <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> will burn, if made deſperate.</p>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe I ſhall return a two ſold Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a Pardon to the Chief Lords and Men of Eſtates, will not affect the <hi>Army,</hi> for that few of them are conſider'd there as Souldiers, in regard that other men, ſubordinate to them, are the Commanders and Leaders in the <hi>Army;</hi> ſo that pardoning them ſecures not the men of action, who lie under ſuch circumſtances as a general Pardon will not free them from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Pardon for all Crimes and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours relating to the <hi>Crown,</hi> will be no Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the <hi>private Souldiers, Captains, Lieutenants,</hi> &amp;c. my Reaſon is, For that all the <hi>Robberies</hi> and <hi>Spoils</hi> done to the Engliſh, were committed by ſuch, though at the ſecret inſtigation and encouragement of their <hi>Great ones.</hi> Now the Engliſh cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62756:18"/>
an Action at <hi>Law</hi> againſt any but theſe private men; and if thereby they become obliged (as in Juſtice they ought) to make <hi>reſtitution</hi> of what they have made a violent Seizure from the other, that muſt certainly bring on their inevitable Ruin, which will make it as equal to them to die in the <hi>Field</hi> as in a <hi>Gaol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, as to the ſecond Motive, That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Pardon</hi> will prevent <hi>Burning</hi> and other Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, I anſwer, That it will have the quite con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary effect, and conſequently be an occaſion of more Miſchief; which I undertake to demonſtrate from the following reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is an unalterable <hi>Maxim,</hi> rivetted amongſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em, as well by the Principles of their Religion as natural <hi>genius</hi> and common Cuſtom, to do as much Miſchief as they poſſibly can to the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and as ſoon as they receive an account of this <hi>Pardon,</hi> will be very induſtrious to leave what marks they can of their inveterate <hi>Fury;</hi> and 'tis poſſible for them to effect this in a days time throughout the Kingdom, and yet keep within the compaſs of their <hi>Pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This General Pardon will not prevent <hi>Burning</hi> and other deſtructive Arts of the Engliſh Plantations, but rather promote them; for that their <hi>Lords</hi> being reinveſted in their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That if the Engliſh Houſes and Improvements be deſtroyed, their <hi>Eſtates</hi> will be the ſooner inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, for that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming in <hi>poor,</hi> will have nothing to build or improve their Eſtates: ſo that in courſe, the Iriſh Lands muſt be firſt Peopl'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62756:18"/>For theſe reaſons it ſeems evident, That a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon will not have the effect propos'd, neither as to the more expeditious reduction of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor for the preventing of the Ruin and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation feared from the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next conſideration, in order to the former, is, What <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> will attend a General <hi>Pardon,</hi> and how it will affect the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt; which ſhall be laid down in theſe ſeven following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will be an encouragement to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to commit the ſame Outrages again, and will animate them to an embracing of the firſt opportunity, which they have now more reaſon to expect to prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them, than formerly, ſince that the <hi>French</hi> are engaged with them in one <hi>bottom,</hi> and are link'd together in a general Intereſt, as being (as 'tis ſaid) by vertue of the late <hi>Compact,</hi> entituled to a ſhare in the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Now, if at any time the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be at leiſure, by concluding of a <hi>Peace</hi> with his <hi>Enemies abroad,</hi> he may, at pleaſure, pour an Army into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>Natives</hi> there will be in a readineſs to give them a kind reception, and that without hardly expoſing themſelves to any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, in regard that they will ſuppoſe that they will be no Loſers by it. Since a <hi>Pardon</hi> attends their greateſt <hi>Outrages,</hi> the worſt that can enſue, will be only to bring them in, and to ſecure them from committing <hi>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will enrich the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and impoveriſh the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, at a moderate computation, may be deem'd to have loſt in <hi>Perſonal Eſtates, Money, Goods,</hi> and <hi>Cattel,</hi> to a greater value than the Land
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62756:19"/>
of the whole Kingdom amounts to, all which is in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> which as it renders the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of little uſe in defence of the Kingdom, ſo on the other ſide, it ſtrengthens the hands of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and makes them formidable and very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of raiſing diſturbances in it. <hi>Money</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> command <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were never ſince the Conqueſt, <hi>Maſters</hi> of more, if they paſs unqueſtioned, with the <hi>Perſonal Eſtates</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It will be the irreſiſtible Ruin of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of that Kingdom, ſeeing that all the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> are deſpoiled of their <hi>Stocks;</hi> ſo that a Tenant having no <hi>Cattel</hi> to put upon his <hi>Land,</hi> can conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pay no Rent, nor be capable of living in the Kingdom. A Calamity better indeed expreſt with <hi>Tears</hi> than <hi>Ink;</hi> and 'tis no ſmall addition to ſo lamentable a ſubject, to ſee ſome Thouſands, that <hi>twelve months</hi> ago, and leſs, lived perhaps as plentifully as any People of <hi>Europe,</hi> at this day <hi>Wandring Beggars,</hi> and ſome periſhing in the <hi>Fields</hi> for want of Suſtenance, as they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably do, if <hi>Ireland</hi> were in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, upon the <hi>Conditions</hi> of a General Pardon to the <hi>Natives.</hi> Great (I had almoſt ſaid, infinite) numbers there are, that in <hi>November</hi> laſt loſt <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Eſtates,</hi> to the value of <hi>Thouſands,</hi> not having now Clothes to their Backs, nor Bread to eat.</p>
            <p>They are now ſcattered through this Kingdom, ſome relieved by the Benevolence of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, others by the publick <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and by reaſon of the diſtance of their abode, are the leſs remarkable; but when once they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62756:19"/>
in the ſame <hi>place,</hi> from whence they were expell'd by Iriſh <hi>Robberies</hi> and the like acts of an inhumane violence, it may reaſonably be ſaid of them, as of the Prophet's dry Bones, <hi>Can theſe live?</hi> and his return will be the proper anſwer, <hi>Thou Lord, knoweſt.</hi> For, ſhould they have no Reprize on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Eſtates, they muſt inevitably periſh at the very <hi>doors</hi> of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As this will ruin all men of Perſonal Eſtates, ſo will it alſo have the ſame effect upon thoſe of <hi>Real:</hi> For, their Tenants being loſt, their Lands muſt of Courſe lie waſte, and even quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated: For, the <hi>Landlords</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were as well ſtripped of their <hi>Perſonal Eſtates,</hi> as their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> and generally came for <hi>England,</hi> with as ſmall a Proviſion for their Subſiſtence in it; ſo that in their return, they will not have a <hi>Penny</hi> to buy <hi>Stock,</hi> nor a <hi>Bed</hi> to <hi>lie</hi> upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As it deſtroys all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that have, or had, an Intereſt in the Kingdom; ſo it for ever deterrs any new Planters. It can never be forgotten, That in the midſt of Peace a <hi>Nation</hi> was deſtroyed in a <hi>day,</hi> and the <hi>Authors</hi> indemnified that did it.</p>
            <p>Who will adventure themſelves in ſuch a <hi>Country,</hi> or, at leaſt, attempt to go to a <hi>place</hi> that lies at the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> of <hi>Savages,</hi> and is not protected by its <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A General Pardon will make it a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Charge</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> as well as place it beyond a poſſibility of its reimburſing the expence its reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will now contract upon this Nation; beſides
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62756:20"/>
the apparent hazard of multiplying the like charge and trouble, by being expos'd to the ſame <hi>Work</hi> in a few years again; for, as long as their <hi>Grandees</hi> enjoy their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> they will influence the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſo as to have them at their <hi>beck,</hi> for any <hi>deſign,</hi> which they will not be wanting to promote, againſt the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> A General Pardon will be the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of preſerving all the Iriſh in the Kingdom, and for the reaſons already mentioned, of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh, which will make it a perfect <hi>Iriſh Colony,</hi> who are wonderfully productive of their Breed, and muſt therefore neceſſarily be kept in Obedience, by a powerful Army, which will be very expenſive to the <hi>CROWN,</hi> for that it is the Engliſh Trade and Conſumption, that made the Revenue of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſinking to a low ebb, muſt be ſupplied out of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons, being allowed to be of force, againſt granting of a General Pardon to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> I will in the next place offer what ſeems an Expedient in this Affair, whereby the <hi>Iriſh</hi> may not be made deſperate, nor yet the loſing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ruined: but that both the one and the other, may be rendered uſeful to the King and Kingdom, and yet even the <hi>Iriſh</hi> not excluded from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's mercy.</p>
            <p>I cannot undertake ſo much as a regular compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Numbers of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but know in one County where the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were numbered 700, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> amounted to 7000. And tho' other Counties of that Kingdom are better planted with <hi>British,</hi> yet at the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62756:20"/>
loweſt, and moſt moderate reckoning, there is above five <hi>Iriſh</hi> for one <hi>Britiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if of ſo many Millions (for it is not to be ſuppoſed that one <hi>Iriſh Papiſt</hi> in that Kingdom is, or indeed can be free, both as a Native, and as of that Communion, as not being admitted to Maſs, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, a prohibition from either of which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be Damnable, that joins not in the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereticks) an Hundred ſhould be excepted from Pardon, could this reaſonably be interpreted an Act of Severity, or a deſign to extirpate a People: Do we find in any Story ſuch a <hi>Decimation?</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, that I uſe the word ſo improperly, for here is not one of Twenty Thouſand taken off: if ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Juſtice can be excuſed to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> it can deſerve no leſs then <hi>Adoration</hi> from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor could ſuch a Miraculous Mercy proceed from any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, or Religion, but ours.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which, 'tis matter of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſee the <hi>Shimeis</hi> of our Age (the Family of <hi>Saul</hi>) throw up the Duſt of their Cloven Feet, and ſcurrilouſly call our <hi>David</hi> a Man of Blood; though to this day, he has not ſuffered one drop to be ſpilt: but in his Royal Will carefully imitates the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary goodneſs of his Bleſſed Maſter, who in the diſcharge of his Embaſſy into this lower World, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That the deſign of his Negotiation, was not, to deſtroy, but to preſerve the Lives of Men: And even in the Pardon propoſed, the Exception is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eighty, and though all of them ſo notoriouſly immerſed in Blood and Rapin, that the very <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> would deem them quite diveſted of Humanity; yet His Majeſty leaves a Door of Mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for them to enter, if they will but teſtifie by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62756:21"/>
their Actions, that they ſtrive to merit an Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>But when this does juſtly ſilence the Enemies of God, and the King, as it reaſonably ought to do, yet they will ſtill impertinently object, That though the Lives of theſe men, may be ſo wrapt up by their own behaviour, as to render them capable of meriting their preſervation, yet their Eſtates muſt be ſacrificed to the Reſentments of the preſent Government: and to make their Seditious noiſe, carry ſome ſound of truth, they ſum up their Eſtates by Multiplication, and that to thrice as much as they really amount to.</p>
            <p>But why do not theſe <hi>Iuſticiaries</hi> who expreſs ſo great a care, and ſollicitude for the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> give us an account of what the <hi>Britiſh</hi> have been deprived of, which is ſo great, that all the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> Eſtates of that Kingdom, were they to be ſold, could not make ſatisfaction for one Moiety, which they have robbed the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of, in their Perſonal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>But I hear ſome of them ſay, by an equal Parity of Reaſon, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> deſire ſatisfaction out of <hi>Iriſh-mens</hi> Eſtates; Merchants may expect reparation for their loſſes at Sea out of Prizes taken by the King's Ships. This Argument may well be thought to proceed from men of <hi>Abdicated</hi> ſenſe, as well as Intereſt: For pray, wherein conſiſts the Parallel? <hi>Merchants</hi> venture themſelves with the expectation of divers Accidents, and Contingencies, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay their deſigns of profit in a form proportionable to their hazards.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew the Conſideration, the Government has for them, and what relief they are to expect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a loſs at Sea, the Parliament provided in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62756:21"/>
for Subſidies of <hi>Tunnage,</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> that in ſuch Caſes, they ſhould receive back the Cuſtoms they paid.</p>
            <p>Now though it be impoſſible to run the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet the Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I durſt be <hi>Guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee</hi> for, will thankfully acknowledge the like ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Give them but as much as they have paid in <hi>Quit rent, Taxes, Harth-money, Cuſtoms,</hi> and <hi>Exciſe,</hi> ſince they were put into a Legal Poſſeſſion of that Kingdom by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and they will deſire no more.</p>
            <p>I confeſs theſe Pot-guns of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> are not worth anſwering, yet I cannot forbear mentioning one thing more:</p>
            <p>Who are they that commit Robberies at Sea? if Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and eſpecially of the King's Subjects, are they treated like Enemies of War? And will they be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a quiet, and peaceable poſſeſſion of what they have robbed from their fellow-Subjects? The caſe is the ſame in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Our fellow-Subjects, for ſo they were entitled, before this Rebellion; ſet upon their quiet and innocent Neighbours, and ſeized vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently upon their whole ſubſtance. How equal the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel then is, of loſing Ships at Sea by a Foreign Enemy, and ſuch Robbers at home, a Child may judge.</p>
            <p>But to come to that I propoſe as an Expedient to anſwer the thing deſigned, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a quick and eaſie Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the purſuit of this Topick, the Queſtion that will ariſe from it, will be, whether pardoning the Commonalty in general, and excepting ſome few of the Grandees, or pardoning the chief men with the Commonalty, under the ſame Qualifications, will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62756:22"/>
moſt contribute to the ſafe and effectual reduction of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I ſhall eſpouſe the firſt of theſe, by aſſerting, That pardoning the Commonalty, and excepting ſome of their greateſt men, will ſooneſt prevail, and that for theſe three Reaſons</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Pardoning the Commonalty, and excepting ſome of their chiefeſt men, will encourage the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to ſubmit upon that very aſſurance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon their own bottom, without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Heads of their <hi>Clans;</hi> which of how contemptible a conſideration ſoever it may appear to ſome, is certainly a matter of the greateſt moment in the Reduction of that Kingdom. For 'tis as well the aſſiduous contrivance, as common intereſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Grandees, to keep the Commonalty under the Circumſtances of a conſtant dependence upon them, endeavouring to poſſeſs them with an opinion, that 'tis by their means, and upon their account only, that the others obtain terms and ſecurity, by which politick influence upon the ordinary ſort, in the cloſing of one Rebellion, they lay a foundation for, and ſo not only give Birth, but add Fuel to another: For the Heads of Clans, as well by themſelves, as by the co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inſtigation of their Prieſts, carefully inſtil into the Ignorant Multitude, that let them make an inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they pleaſe, they can incur no danger; for at the utmoſt extremity of things they are, and muſt ever be the Grand Inſtruments of their Preſervation: Let them be never ſo deeply involved in Blood and Rapin, yet that their power and intereſt is ſuch, as muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bring them off: They are the Tall Cedars, that can at any time defend the lower Shrubs, and what need they fear, ſince they are under ſo ſtrong a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62756:22"/>
Guard, and Protection, whoſe Perſons are ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as well as inviolable to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as always to ſhield them from harm.</p>
            <p>But if this deluded <hi>Mobile</hi> ſee, that the King has no regard to their Leaders, but on the contrary excludes the greateſt of them from Pardon; this will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to them, that 'tis his Royal Mercy, not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Lords, that muſt preſerve them: This will remove the opinion of their dependance upon their Lords, and conſequently oblige them to ſuitable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of His Majeſty's Clemency to them; by which means deriving their preſervation from the Crown, they will wholly depend upon it: whereas they never were yet ſeparated from the intereſt of their Clans, but in thoſe few years of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the good effect whereof thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes of it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and now living, can give a deſcription; when moſt of the Commonalty went to Church, and Doors with a Wooden Latch were as ſecure, as an Iron Grate in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pardoning the Commonalty, without any dependence upon their Commanders, being extended as a matter of meer Grace and Princely favour to them, will poſſeſs thoſe poor people with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the good Inclinations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> towards them, which will induce them to a ready ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>They (as moſt barbarous People) are generally of Diffident, and Timorous Natures, and 'tis with ſome difficulty, that they can be prevailed upon to believe, that their Crimes ſhall be forgiven. This, I ſuppoſe, may proceed from the fierceneſs, and cruelty of their own Diſpoſitions, as not looking for thoſe unexpected returns of kindneſs from ſuch, whom they have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62756:23"/>
ſo Implacable an Averſion, and Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt they crowd under their Leaders, they are foſtered up in that Opinion, which the way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed of reducing them, will take them off, and make them ſenſible that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> look not on them as the Authors, but the forced Inſtruments of this Rebellion; which, when they are made apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of, will ſoon divert the ſtream from its former Current, and their private Soldiers will fly from their marked out Commanders, as from a Plague, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Contagion. Now that this is no Novel Notion, their very practice in former Rebellions does fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, when the Father to ſave his own, would betray his Sons Life, which was the uſual method through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom: Neither is it in the power of their Prieſts (how Arbitrary ſoever in the exerciſe of their Function) to govern, or reſtrain them longer, than whilſt their own Party can protect them; their Secular, carrying ſo great a Predominancy over their Spiritual Intereſt, as makes them inſeparable Slaves to their Cow, and <hi>Pottato</hi>-Garden; and he only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them that is Lord of the Soil, without any regard to Proximity of Blood, or Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to my Third Reaſon, That pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commons, is the ready way to put a period to the Rebellion: Our Laws, as well as Reaſon acquaint us, That the King's General Pardon is no ſecurity to any private man for perſonal actions, for any Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Miſchiefs done to the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Now all the waſte, and havock committed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was done by the Commonalty, though by private orders,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62756:23"/>
and inſtructions of their Leaders, and to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt profit.</p>
            <p>Theſe men will be told by their Lawyers, That this Pardon is but a ſnare to bring them in, and that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Actions which will be commenced againſt them, will rot them in Gaol.</p>
            <p>But the General Pardon excepting ſo many men of Eſtates, and in expreſs words declaring that they ſhall be converted to a reſtitution of what the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> have loſt, this will quiet, and allay the fears of the Commonalty, that they ſhall be free from Actions and Suits at Law, by the ſatisfaction the Eſtates of their Commanders will make.</p>
            <p>If theſe Reaſons be allowed ſufficient for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what they are alledged, the next thing that falls under our preſent Conſideration, is, What Settlement will moſt effectually conduce for the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy planting of that Kingdom: for that there is too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Reaſons to fear, that the greateſt part of the Farmers, and Traders are now incapacitated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently can be of little uſe, or benefit, till ſomething be raiſed to put them in ſtock; ſo that it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be a new People that muſt bring that upon the Wheel, for it is not viſible how the late <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt can make it more.</p>
            <p>Now to invite both His Majeſties Subjects, as well as Foreigners of the Reformed Religion, into that Kingdom, theſe things offer to their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To take off the Umbrage and Fears of new Rebellions.</p>
            <p>And to give a rational proſpect and aſſurance of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſuch as ſhall come there, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62756:24"/>For the Firſt, to remove the fears, which men are generally poſſeſs'd with of Inſurrections in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there needs a retroſpection into that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince its firſt Conqueſt by the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> and then ſee the ſucceſs it had: which uſeful Animadverſion will naturally lead men to a conſideration of what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes and miſcarriages it has ſince been incident to; and to what in a more eſpecial manner it has been of late obnoxious; it being a received Maxim, as well in the Body Politick, as Natural, that the moſt ſecure way of applying a wholeſome Remedy, is firſt to make a right diſcovery of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The Deportment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their firſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland</hi> was managed with abundance of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and Generoſity of Temper, by all means and ways imaginable, indulging a Savage People over-run with rudeneſs and barbarity: and ſeeing that they were then united in the Principles of one <hi>Religion,</hi> it might be conjectured no artful undertaking, or task of extream difficulty, to reduce them to an entire obedience to the Civil Government, who ſtood ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly well affected to that of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical.</p>
            <p>But it was afterwards found a Work of a far different nature, and much harder to effect, to reform the Errors and Innovations introduced into their Church, than to propagate Chriſtianity, where it was never eſtabliſhed before: the Iriſh hating, in religious matters, what came from the <hi>Engliſh Clergy;</hi> and ſo inveterate they were againſt their Reformers, that they would <hi>anathematize</hi> all ſuch as ſeem'd inclined to favour them, giving it in ſtrict Charge to their <hi>Children,</hi> never to imitate the Cuſtoms and Manners of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which, to create the greater abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62756:24"/>
againſt, as well as to demonſtrate their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable rancour, would (agreeably to their more early nurture and education of their Off-ſpring) put the firſt <hi>Food</hi> into their <hi>Mouths</hi> with the point of a <hi>Sword;</hi> a true <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of their ſavage Cruelty, as well as their expreſſions were a denotation of their great Barbarity, which they uſed upon that occaſion, <hi>Wiſhing that they might never die, but with a Sword in their hands, in the midſt of their enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Barbariſm</hi> the Engliſh Government thought to eradicate, by reducing them to the more eaſie Diſcipline of Civility, and that to be done by the gentle methods of Kindneſs, and a favourable Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to their <hi>Lords</hi> and the <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Clans,</hi> making them Preſents, &amp; giving them a legal power over their Followers and Tenants, thereby to wean and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them from that Arbitrary Violence which they had uſurp'd before; all which, like <hi>Honey</hi> in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated <hi>Stomach,</hi> turned to <hi>Choler,</hi> and they became the greater Enemies to good Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by having the opportunity put into their hands of converting them from a regular adminiſtration to vile and enormous Abuſes.</p>
            <p>To this the Engliſh Government ſuperadded that powerful <hi>Tye</hi> of <hi>Marriage,</hi> that ſo uniting in Blood might be an Introduction to Engliſh <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Civility;</hi> but all this was like <hi>Corn ſown upon Thorns,</hi> choaked up by the natural brutality of that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People, inſomuch, that they could not be brought to any part of conformity (no, not in their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to Engliſh Faſhions, until by <hi>Statute-Laws</hi> they were compelled to decency: Such an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deteſtation they bore to the Manners and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> which recalls to my mind a paſſage I was in part an eye-witneſs of: A Gentleman of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62756:25"/>
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> marrying one of <hi>Lynſter,</hi> whoſe Education there being ſomething refined by converſing with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and coming to his own Houſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of the Country, all his <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Clans,</hi> brought in <hi>Beefs, Muttons, &amp;c.</hi> in a great abundance, and the Lady finding more than could be ſpent while 'twas freſh, ordered to have ſome of it powdered up; which theſe People hearing of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> as invaders of their ancient Priviledges and Liberties, which (as they affirm'd) were never violated before in that Houſe, where 'twas never known that <hi>Fleſh</hi> was <hi>ſalted,</hi> but on the <hi>Trencher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt intreat the Reader's <hi>Pardon</hi> for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and return to the ſtill-miſtaken tenderneſs of the <hi>Engliſh Government,</hi> which was ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, that though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were never <hi>twenty years</hi> quiet, and ſcarce half ſo long, till King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, yet did the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> of <hi>England</hi> not only vouchſafe Pardon, but likewiſe heapt Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great Honour and Dignity upon thoſe who, in the general acceptation, were irreconcileable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both to It and Them. I will not ſtand to enumerate particulars, but rather referr the Reader to the ſeveral <hi>Authors</hi> that have writ of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſhall only give a ſuccinct account of ſome paſſages of the Rebellion of Forty One, too deeply imprinted in the Memories of Men, ever to be eras'd or forgotten, which, if Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi> that writ ſo excellently of the Defects of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the <hi>Civil Policy,</hi> in the Government of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> had lived to be a <hi>Spectator</hi> of, he would have enlarged that admirable <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> in which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically lamented what we have by two <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſince fatally found true: In the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Forty

            </p>
            <p>But in all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> or <hi>Articles</hi> made with the <hi>Iriſh, Cromwel</hi> obſerved one ſtanding. <hi>Rule,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to give a <hi>Pardon</hi> for Eſtate to any of their <hi>Grandees,</hi> nor grant terms for <hi>Prieſts</hi> to remain in the Kingdom.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62756:26"/>
met with in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which was, That moſt of the <hi>Common People</hi> went to <hi>Church,</hi> and ſome of the diſcreeteſt of their men of <hi>Eſtates</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hearken with great attention to Diſcourſes made upon the <hi>Fopperies</hi> and abſurd Innovations of <hi>Popery.</hi> The Country flouriſhed to a vaſt degree, grew rich and populous to a Miracle, and had the ſame Settlement been confirm'd, in which it lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Reſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, there had been no poſſibility left for the effecting of thoſe <hi>fatal Miſchiefs</hi> which have prevail'd with ſo irreſiſtible a force in that poor <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But his <hi>Mercy</hi> to this perfidious People was, upon its firſt vouchſafing, feared to be an <hi>ominous preſage</hi> of <hi>Cruelty</hi> to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants:</hi> And we have now but too fatal experience of the truth of what even at that time it portended. By what has been inſiſted upon, it ſeems ſufficiently plain, That the Succeſs attending the Indulgence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> has alwaies been to enable and animate them to freſh <hi>Rebellions,</hi> in which their inveterate <hi>Genius</hi> has fully ſhewn, That they were never wanting upon the leaſt inviting opportunity, alwaies with open <hi>Arms</hi> and as ready <hi>Hearts</hi> embracing the Enemies of <hi>England,</hi> as their Patrons, in imitation of the vile and ungrateful Carriage of the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom they owned as <hi>Brethren,</hi> when they were in Proſperity, and ſtood in need of their aſſiſtance and protection; but diſclaim'd all kind of relation or affinity to them, when they were diſtreſt by other Nations, and ſo either called for their Relief, or elſe ſuppoſing that the Enemies of the <hi>Jews</hi> would proceed againſt them as their Friends and Confederates, reſolved to untwiſt all the Bonds of their Alliance, and to ſide with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62756:26"/>
Adverſary, when it appeared to be for their Intereſt ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And ſomething parallel to this, is alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> toward the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> were their <hi>Catholick Guardians,</hi> from whom they boaſtingly derived their original Extraction and Deſcent: Now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are their <hi>Paltroons,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> their <hi>Deity,</hi> and ſo as <hi>Catholick</hi> as they pretend, would not ſtick to make court to the <hi>Turk,</hi> were he in a capacity to invade <hi>England,</hi> and to offer them aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The premiſes of this Diſcourſe ſeem very copious as to the aſſerting a neceſſity of extraordinary acts to take off the fears that, by the experience of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Precedents,</hi> may reaſonably be judg'd to attend that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to give encouragement for <hi>new,</hi> as well as for <hi>old</hi> Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Now there ſeems nothing poſſible to ſecure that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but the extirpation of <hi>two Setts</hi> of Men among them, ſuch as are inveſted in the greateſt Command and Authority over their <hi>Bodies;</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> who have ſo abſolute a <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> over their <hi>Souls.</hi> For theſe are the men that have been the great Inſtruments and Incendiaries of all their <hi>Rebellions,</hi> that have as well forwarded as headed the eaſie Multitude, and without whoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation</hi> the <hi>Populace</hi> would have ſubmiſſively ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced under, and never appear'd againſt the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh.</hi> And if our long experience of former Times and Revolutions be deem'd a competent Teſtimony in this caſe, With what greater ſhew of Reaſon have we now cauſe to be afraid of the time to come, eſpecially if we conſider the preſent juncture and Conſtitution of Affairs? For now the <hi>French</hi> have found the way into that <hi>Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62756:27"/>
throughly acquainted with the Intereſt, Situation, Strength, or rather Weakneſs of it; are entituled to a proportion in it by vertue of the pretended Right of the late King <hi>James,</hi> and in order to that, have <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> given them. This mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters juſt occaſion of fear, that they will give fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Alarums</hi> to that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which never had before a foreign Enemy in the <hi>bowels</hi> of it; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing but the edges and out-skirts of it, whereas the <hi>French</hi> induſtriouſly pry into every corner, upon the favour of him that delights in the deſtruction of theſe <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> which to facilitate, or rather to the utmoſt of his power compleat, gives up the diſtreſſed innocent <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into the barbarous hands of the <hi>French King,</hi> whoſe Succeſs and Dexterity, though not Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is greater in the Butchering <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as the good and great King <hi>James</hi> calls the Proteſtants of theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Now, if the common <hi>Herd</hi> of the Iriſh be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their prime Leaders, and from their <hi>Wolves in Sheeps clothing,</hi> there will be none left to <hi>blow</hi> up the <hi>Coal</hi> of Treaſon or Sedition among them, or any to head or animate them in it: And the progreſs of a few years of careful Inſtruction from our Proteſtant Clergy, in the Rudiments and firſt Draughts of our Profeſſion, will initiate them into the more ſafe <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>eaſie Government</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh.</hi> Beſides, if the <hi>French</hi> have no <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> left in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to give them a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reception, (as in this caſe they would not) there would be no great reaſon to fear them, neither would they dare to attempt the <hi>Country</hi> without that dependence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62756:27"/>If it ſhould be thought hard uſage to diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Iriſh-men;</hi> it may be anſwered, that there are <hi>Fields of Mercy</hi> for the King to extend: and this deſired for the preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> is but a <hi>ſmall Encloſure;</hi> not <hi>one,</hi> as I ſaid before, of <hi>Twenty: Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand;</hi> nor was there ever greater Criminals up to the Elbows in <hi>Proteſtant Blood</hi> in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Forty One:</hi> the very ſame individual men that are engaged in this, <hi>found guilty,</hi> and once Condemned for that, and how their <hi>Eſtates</hi> after forfeiture were torn from the <hi>Britiſh Protestants,</hi> is no ſecret to the World. Nor is it unknown, that upon their <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> in the year <hi>One Thouſand Six Hundred and Sixty two,</hi> above <hi>Sixty Thouſand</hi> Proteſtants were drove out to ſeek their Bread, and ſcattered through the World: This was nothing. But to baniſh leſs than an Hundred muſt be great Cruelty, though men <hi>twice</hi> guilty of Blood and Treaſon, and thoſe whoſe Eſtates they are in preſent poſſeſſion of, ſtained with neither.</p>
            <p>This is a Compendious, as well as an eaſie way to remove the fears of future Rebellions, and gives good aſſurance for the time to come, that the <hi>Commonalty</hi> will be united as one people with the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> when they have neither <hi>Lord,</hi> nor <hi>Prieſt</hi> to follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when they have no Inſtructers to bear up the credit of their old Superſtition, they will of courſe become <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant Communion;</hi> for the people are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally zealous of their <hi>erroneous Traditions,</hi> inſtill'd into them by their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and are of a Credulous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ſhews, that the Authors of theſe being once removed, the effects will ſoon ceaſe, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for want of their own, will naturally reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the <hi>Reformed Religion:</hi> We know that 'tis a <hi>common principle</hi> of Mankind, to have ſome Religion or other; and then moſt ignorant, and barbarous parts

Or, is it only in caſes of invincible ignorance, and that but a bare poſſibility; whereas we affirm a certainty of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our own Church; and can any rational man be ſuppoſed to be encouraged by this Conceſſion (if it be any) either to perſevere in a <hi>Religion</hi> which under the moſt favourable Qualifications that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hath but a bare poſſibility of Salvation, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that to very few perſons; or to eſpouſe that, in preference to another, that hath all the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable grounds of a firm certainty, and the moſt convincing aſſurance that <hi>Religion</hi> can be capable of?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62756:30"/>
Were not this to forſake a ſecure Ship, and in a Storm to put to Sea upon a Plank? or like an unskilful Pilot, that upon his approach to an Haven, ſhould be told, that there are two different ways that lead to the Port; the one direct, and ſafe, the other circular, and full of dangerous Rocks and Shelves, and yet ſhould make choice of the latter, becauſe there is a bare poſſibility of eſcaping from Shipwrack. Again, granting a bare poſſibility of Salvation under the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid limitations, is only an effect of Charity in us, and not of the leaſt approbation of their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and herein we imitate the Holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who as he gave an higher Encomium to this, than to any other Divine Grace: ſo alſo acknowledged, that ſuch as built Hay and Stubble upon the Foundation of Chriſtianity, ſhould be ſaved ſo as by fire, that is, with difficulty; whereas ſuch as did ſo, denied the poſſibility of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Salvation, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does to us. To this we may add the practice of the Orthodox towards the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who were ſo favourable in their Conſtructions of them, although <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as not to exclude them from the aforeſaid poſſibility; but on the contrary, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> like the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> confined Salvation to themſelves, and denied it to the Orthodox. But I ſhall not inſiſt longer upon theſe Points, referring the <hi>Inquiſitive Reader,</hi> for his more ample ſatisfaction, to Archbiſhop <hi>Laud's</hi> Book againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuit, and to the Learned Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s his Vindication of the ſaid Book: But though the brevity deſigned, hinders me from protracting this Diſcourſe upon this Subject, yet not from making a neceſſary Apology for what I have ſaid already. Some may perhaps be ſo Cenſorious, as to ſuppoſe the foregoing Arguments to be deſigned by the Author, as a Model, or Platform for others to imitate,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62756:30"/>
or tranſcribe in the reduction of the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> to our Church; and therefore to take off that imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think fit in my own defence to make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Aſſeveration, That my ſole intention in it, proceeded from a pure Zeal to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and a deſire to ſhew how eaſie it might be to work upon the Vulgar <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> by theſe or the like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, if their Prieſts were once removed from them: This, as it would certainly be a very great happineſs to the Nation in general, by making it of one inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by being of one <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo would it be an act of Tranſcendent Charity to the Souls of theſe poor Wretches, who are miſerably ſeduced by the Impious Deluſions of their Prieſts, and with all good men ought to be the principal inducement of prohibiting them a free exerciſe of their innovated and depraved Superſtition, which cannot be effectually accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed without expelling their Prieſts out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And if the <hi>Britiſh</hi> could be ſo happy as to live, to reap the benefit of the reduction of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to their Church, it might reaſonably be hoped, that this preſent would put a period to all future <hi>Rebellions</hi> in that Kingdom. To which I may add a Paſſage of a Country Fellow, who paſſing through the <hi>Rubbidge</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> after the <hi>Fire;</hi> and ſeeing a Crowd of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, came up to them, and enquired what was the matter? ſome anſwered, that they were waiting for the Committee to ſettle the Foundations; and one ſaid, they had reſolved the Buildings ſhould be on the old Foundation; to which the Countrey Fellow with an Oath replyed, It had been as good then, that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had never been burnt. I leave others to make the Application, and ſhall only ſay with Lamentation, that what that poor Fellow ſpoke ignorantly, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have no other
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62756:31"/>
Expectations to bear up their Spirits in this Deluge of miſery, now violently deſcended upon them; but, that as the Blood of the Martyrs in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> increaſed their Numbers; ſo this may lay a Foundation, by ſhewing the indiſpenſable neceſſity of putting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> paſt the hopes of repeating the like <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and that nothing but ſuch a method can poſſibly repair the Ruines of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto been ſhewing the Miſeries and Calamities that have attended the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the frequent Rebellions of the Iriſh.</p>
            <p>And then the Juſtice of making ſome Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this time to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> out of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi> of ſome of the moſt notorious Leaders of this <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And have alſo ſhewn the great advantage ſuch <hi>Juſtice</hi> would derive upon that Kingdom at this time, in new planting it.</p>
            <p>I am in the next Remarks to obſerve, how much it imports <hi>England</hi> to improve this opportunity, which the <hi>Enemies</hi> of their publick Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity have put into their hands: and this is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſo copious a nature, as might claim a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe by it ſelf; but my deſign being to awaken, not direct the Wiſdom and Conduct of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall only remind them of the Charge and Expence of <hi>Engliſh Blood</hi> that poor diſtreſſed Kingdom has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready coſt, and then lay before them the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that would accrew to <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>Ireland</hi> was once reinſtated and ſettled in <hi>Proteſtant</hi> hands. That the loſs of <hi>Men</hi> is the greateſt misfortune and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt puniſhment that can arrive to, and be inflicted upon a Nation, is confirmed by the Judgment of an infallible <hi>Author.</hi> For when the <hi>Prophet</hi> was ſent to <hi>David,</hi> to offer three things to his choice;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62756:31"/>
not one of them conſiſted in depriving him of <hi>Treaſure, Herds,</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> but every puniſhment was, the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not poſſible to give an exact account of the numbers, that <hi>Caldron</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Ireland</hi> may be truly call'd, has ſwallowed up in five hundred years; but according to the beſt computation that can be made, there has been by <hi>War, Famine,</hi> and <hi>Murders,</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> more than <hi>Twenty Hundred Thouſand Souls.</hi> By the ſeveral accounts in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> of the Supplies ſent from <hi>England</hi> in the Rebellions there, the computation is made too large here to mention the particulars, but may reaſonably be believed, if we recount the ſeveral <hi>Rebellions</hi> in <hi>Five hundred years,</hi> when there was never <hi>Twenty years free;</hi> and in the <hi>laſt,</hi> where ſome account was taken, it was found to exceed <hi>Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> and that after not <hi>Twenty years</hi> of perfect Peace; for although the Kingdom was for the greateſt part quiet, during the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> and ſome of that of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, yet ſome places of it were conſtantly involv'd in Trouble.</p>
            <p>It would hardly be believ'd in Story, ſince there is no precedent, That a <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſo frequently conquer'd, and ſo horribly outragious in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and inhumane <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> ſhould ſtill be put into the hands of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> that are implacable in their hatred to their Conquerors; but it has ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been an Infatuation than Mercy in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to retain ſuch <hi>Serpents</hi> in their Boſoms, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can excuſe, but that it is a Judgment of God to blind the Eyes of his People in this matter, that ſo theſe <hi>Philiſtines</hi> may be left to puniſh the Sins of theſe Nations, who have reaſon to repent for their paſt Omiſſions, and to pray that they may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62756:32"/>
never more be incident to the ſame Errour and Miſcarriage, leſt the Meſſage of the Prophet <hi>Ahab</hi> be ours, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go out of thy hand, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the loſs of that which comprehends it, 'twill appear vain to mention the Treaſure this <hi>Kingdom</hi> has buried there, but it is an additional aggravation to our other Misfortunes, and had half of it been expended in other Adventures, it might have been return'd with greater advantage than the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> has hitherto been worth: Not but that it is obvious to every eye, that <hi>Europe</hi> cannot ſhew ſuch a ſpot of Ground, that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Motto <hi>Trajan</hi> gave to his Money in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Dacia,</hi> which applying to this fertile Iſland, we may thus expreſs, <hi>Hiberniae Abundantia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus hinted at the Loſſes which <hi>England</hi> has ſuſtain'd by Indulgence given to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> I now come to diſcuſs thoſe Advantages which would accrue to this Kingdom, if regard were had in the next Settlement to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants,</hi> that have their Dependence in that Country.</p>
            <p>And not to trouble the Reader with what he may ſee put forth, by a more accurate Pen, in that ingenious Diſcourſe of the <hi>Intereſt of</hi> England <hi>in the preſervation of</hi> Ireland: I ſhall only name ſome few things by him omitted, and firſt ſhew, That <hi>Ireland</hi> might be made a Nurſery for Seamen to <hi>England;</hi> which upon too frequent experience is found to be ſo much wanting, that upon every <hi>Marine War,</hi> the Merchants Ships are forc'd to ſtay at home, for want of Men to ſupply them; ſo that it may be ſaid, (though a Paradox) that by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62756:32"/>
the hands of War, we deſtroy the <hi>Sinews</hi> of it, <hi>Money,</hi> by our <hi>Embargoes</hi> upon Trade.</p>
            <p>Now, ſince <hi>England</hi> juſtly challenges the <hi>Priority</hi> in Trade, and will by no means admit <hi>Ireland</hi> to touch the forbidden Fruit, their Navigation, this is the way not only to keep them from tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but alſo at the ſame time to employ them in being Foſterers (to uſe their own Language) to your Navigation, and that is, by keeping them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>Fiſhings.</hi> That Iſland ſeeming to be ſet in the Sea, as a Bait for the Inhabitants of the Deep, and might very well imploy Twenty thouſand in that Service, which, beſides the immenſe Treaſure the product of their Labours would bring to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> this other ſignal advantage would accrew from it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The having ſo many men at a call, and in actual readineſs for the Service of <hi>England,</hi> ſince they will never be engag'd in Voyages abroad.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Ireland</hi> may be a <hi>Nurſery</hi> for Seamen, ſo is it a <hi>Forreſt,</hi> out of which the wooden, yet invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, Walls of <hi>England</hi> may be repaired, the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Ireland</hi> being in ſome reſpects, and for divers uſes, more proper for building Ships, than the freer and clean Oak of <hi>England.</hi> Nor muſt we end here, but as we have begun with the Timber for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and brought them on the <hi>Stocks,</hi> ſo muſt not leave them until flown from their Neſts, with their Wings ſpread at Sea; it being practicable to build, rigg, and even from the <hi>Vane</hi> at the <hi>Topmaſt-head</hi> to the <hi>Bolt</hi> in the <hi>Keel,</hi> to ſet out a Ship to Sea from <hi>Ireland.</hi> I have ſeen one of two hundred Tunn ſo fitted, excepting the Sails, which might eaſily be had, if encouragement were given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iron</hi> is not wanting in that <hi>Kingdom; Flax</hi> for <hi>white Occum</hi> there is in great abundance; as alſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62756:33"/>
               <hi>Hemp</hi> for <hi>Cordage,</hi> which is made there. And as before I mentioned the encreaſe of Seamen, ſo in this I might urge the addition of <hi>Ship-Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might enumerate, even to a Volume, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances wherein <hi>Ireland</hi> may be of uſe to <hi>England,</hi> but I ſhall name for all but two more, that of <hi>Iron</hi> and the <hi>Linnen Manufactory,</hi> both of which drain out of <hi>England</hi> more than all the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities imported into it beſides: This, without a ſerious conſideration of the Aſſertion, ſeems an extravagant Notion; I muſt therefore, before I paſs from it, give ſome Reaſons for my opinion, which be pleas'd to take in the following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Conſumption of <hi>Linnen</hi> is of greater value than <hi>Silks,</hi> or any <hi>foreign Manufactory;</hi> for, not the pooreſt <hi>Beggar</hi> at the Door, but bears a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in that Commodity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Importation of <hi>Linnen</hi> admits of no Improvement nor Exportation to any part of the World, but our own Plantations; but <hi>Silks,</hi> I mean raw <hi>Grogreen, Yarn, Cypreſs, Cotton,</hi> and many fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities are in <hi>England</hi> improved and manufactured; ſo that upon Exportation they fetch into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> a great part of what was taken out, by the <hi>Importation;</hi> as is found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade doth, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> carried thither, for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Commodities, that after brought home by <hi>Exportation,</hi> bring in more ready Money than was ſent out for their purchace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62756:33"/>
               <hi>Linnen</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> are the Commodities, I mean thoſe of <hi>Swedeland</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt Sea,</hi> which take from us the leaſt of our Native Commodities, and by that means draw away ſo much Money, that the Computation being made, has been found to be the loſs of <hi>England</hi> in ſome Millions by that Trade, of <hi>Linnen, &amp;c.</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I preſume, by theſe few Inſtances already nam'd, it will be allowed, That <hi>Linnen</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> carry away the greateſt part of the Coin and Treaſure of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> for Bills of <hi>Exchange</hi> are the ſame thing, and allowed ſo by men of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>Now, if <hi>Ireland,</hi> be capable of ſuch a manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to furniſh the ſame Commodities, this will ſave the loſs of ſo much Treaſure, as yearly goes out of <hi>England</hi> into foreign parts to purchaſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Experience</hi> is an undeniable Evidence in this caſe, and that which may be done in part, is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to effect in the whole.</p>
            <p>There was in the year before <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s acceſſion to the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tranſported out of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Iron-pots, Bar-Iron, &amp;c.</hi> to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of more then Twenty Thouſand pounds, and the <hi>Linnen Manufactory</hi> was in ſo hopeful a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that of it a very conſiderable value was ſhipped into <hi>England,</hi> and afforded cheaper than it can poſſibly be brought from any parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Now, if all that has been diſcours'd upon this Subject be apparently practicable, and that ſo vaſt an improvement may be made of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the advantage of <hi>England,</hi> and that nothing hath been
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62756:34"/>
ſuch an inſuperable Obſtacle and Impediment unto it, as the great Indulgence given to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and conſequently the freſh inſtances of Rebellion in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as deriv'd from the former: It ſeems then extreamly rational to remove thoſe publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, by laying a Foundation of future Safety, and of a firm and laſting Peace in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which would invite Inhabitants thither, that might ſecure that Nation to the CROWN of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> with leſs Coſt and greater Returns for that Charge now expended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe this Diſcourſe with a ſuccinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what advantage ſuch a Settlement would bring to His preſent Majeſty, and his Succeſſors; which I ſhall endeavour to ſhew in the following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the encreaſe of Subjects, We find that King <hi>David,</hi> (who was a man after God's own Heart) ambition'd nothing beyond the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his People; and it had not been his Sin, but Glory, to have encreaſed them; but his fault conſiſted in this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The numbring of them, of which God had made a ſolemn Promiſe to the <hi>Patriarch Abraham,</hi> That they ſhould be as the Stars in Heaven, that cannot be numbred. So ſaid the Angel, <hi>Look and ſee if thou canſt count them.</hi> This may be inverted in the <hi>Story</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where the numbers ſlain are harder to be reckoned than are thoſe of the living.</p>
            <p>But if there was thought to be near <hi>Two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> of Souls in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the beginning of this laſt Ravage, we may reaſonably account it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62756:34"/>
for there to have been five times that number, if Acts of Violence had not put a period to more mens Lives, than that of natural Death: And in proportion to this, With what vaſt incredible mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of men (may we reaſonably compute) would theſe Kingdoms have abounded, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how rich and invincible?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How would it contribute to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fame, and immortalize the Memory of our Gracious and Victorious <hi>King,</hi> to all Poſterity, that under his moſt Auſpicious Reign ſuch an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Model, and frame of Government ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as none of his <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> could ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto? Which would verifie that of our great and miraculous Deliverer, which was ſaid of <hi>David, And he ſhall be as the light of the morning when the Sun ariſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This would infinitely augment their Majeſties Revenue; as to which, that <hi>Ireland</hi> may be made conſiderable, is apparent from the ſeveral Gradations already made in that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> Reigns precedent to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> we hear of nothing, but of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Money into that <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In her Reign there was ſomething raiſed in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> conducing to its ſupport, which was in proportion to the Forfeitures and Abatements of the <hi>Iriſh Intereſt,</hi> for that nothing improved the Receipts but the leſſening of them, which made room for more induſtrious people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62756:35"/>In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, there was a farther Enlargement and Encouragement given to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants,</hi> and accordingly the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue encreaſed from <hi>thirty five thouſand pounds</hi> to <hi>fifty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt made ſome addition to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Settlement, and by the encouragement of Grants, to ſtrengthen defective Titles, advanc'd the Revenue to <hi>eighty thouſand pounds,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly did that Country grow and improve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands and induſtrious management of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> that where Money was formerly, in the <hi>Reign</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> debaſed twenty pound <hi>per Cent,</hi> beyond the intrinſick value of <hi>Sterling,</hi> it came to that paſs, that Gold became a Burthen to the Kingdom, and men in their Bargains made exceptions of it in Payment, but the <hi>bloody Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre</hi> in <hi>Forty One</hi> ſoon put an end to that Flood of Proſperity.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Reign</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, upon his <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> lay under ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, occaſioned from their Fears of a <hi>Riſing</hi> from the indulgence given to the <hi>Natives,</hi> procured by the Intereſt of the late <hi>King James,</hi> then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> whoſe Darlings and eſpecial Favourites they were, by means of whoſe intereſſed regard for them, many (by his powerful ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to his Brother) were reſtored to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, that were Capital in their Crimes. This gave juſt occaſion of Jealouſie to the <hi>Britiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> that moſt of their Enemies would meet

with the like ſucceſs; and during this Inundation, the <hi>Revenue</hi> of <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>In-land Exciſe,</hi> dwindled to leſs than 70000 pounds <hi>per Annum:</hi> But upon the King's better information of the ſettlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> great Encouragements were revived to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and then in one year commencing in 1664, the <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> and <hi>import Exciſe,</hi> that upon an exact account made the precedent year but 34000 pounds clear, made 86000: So great an alteration did the promiſed ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> effect in that Kingdom: And in the ſame proportion did the <hi>In-land</hi> Exciſe advance from 36000 to 80000 pounds, and from that time forward, until the Acceſſion of the late <hi>King</hi> to the Throne, did the Revenue riſe, and amount to 140000 in the Import Duty, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 100000 pounds, in the <hi>In-land Exciſe:</hi> But from the Reign of the late <hi>King,</hi> it daily declined; a plain Demonſtration that the Revenue of <hi>Ireland,</hi> like the Army of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> prevailed no longer than the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> was lift up in favour of them.</p>
            <p>Now by the ſame rule of proportion, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradoe</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> flouriſheth with the growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> may his preſent Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Augmentation of his Revenue, as that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the hands of the <hi>Britiſh;</hi> and were it proper in this Diſcourſe to deſcend to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, it would be no difficult province to evince, how poſſible it is for that Kingdom to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to double the value it ever yet made to the Crown.</p>
            <p>I have now come to a period of my deſign, and having given a true, and (I hope) Impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Nature, Temper, and Conſtitution of that hitherto unhappy Kingdom, together with a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62756:36"/>
deſcription of the proper Cauſes of thoſe diſmal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, and Viciſſitudes, which have attended the fortune of its <hi>Engliſh Inhabitants:</hi> I ſhall in few words Apologize for this Narrative, which I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the ſenſe of the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants,</hi> whoſe lot is fallen in that <hi>Akeldama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not then preſume, to anticipate the King's unlimited Clemency to all his Subjects, or deſire that it ſhould be wholly engroſſed by ſuch as are <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> much leſs to offer Reaſons for the utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Natives; but rather wiſh their <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> than <hi>Confuſion;</hi> and to the end that they may become our Brethren, as well in <hi>Religion,</hi> as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Intereſt, do humbly offer theſe <hi>Remarks,</hi> by which (we preſume) it doth evidently appear, that without the total remove of their Peſtilent Deluders, the Prieſts, and extirpating the moſt conſiderable of their Leaders, and men of Eſtates, that Kingdom can never be eſtabliſhed upon the firm <hi>baſis</hi> of a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and laſting peace: but on the contrary be expoſed to greater danger and diſtreſs, than it has ever been ſubject to, ſince the Conqueſt: For, beſides the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign pretenſions that were never ſo plauſible, as now, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will not be encouraged to plant ſo readily there, as they have formerly done, by which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> will ſoon fill the Kingdom; and by their Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious increaſe in their numbers, will improve pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably in their ſtrength, which with aſſiſtance from the <hi>French,</hi> will render them as well invincible in their own thoughts, as really more formidable than ever to the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> and ſo bring this riſing <hi>Phoenix</hi> to <hi>aſhes,</hi> out of which it can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to revive.</p>
            <p>But all our hopes (under the Divine diſpoſer of all things here below) are wrapt up in His preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62756:36"/>
great Wiſdom and Conduct, in which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt reluctance we chearfully, and moſt humbly, acquieſce; and agreeably to the Title, and patient ſubmiſſion of our <hi>Mephivoſheth,</hi> make our devout and hearty Prayers, for the Long and Happy <hi>Reign</hi> of their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>For we were all but <hi>Dead Men,</hi> when the <hi>Lord our King came for our Deliverance;</hi> and if it be his Will, let the <hi>Ziba's</hi> of that Kingdom take all, ſo that we may live in Peace, under the benign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Government, who hath ſaved us from the <hi>Jaws</hi> of that <hi>Roman Beaſt,</hi> which was open to devour not only us, but theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> and hath ſo ſeaſonably preſerved us from ſinking into an Abyſs of Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at a time, when there ſeemed none to help, or to deliver.</p>
            <p>And now that powerful, and all wiſe Providence, which has ſo eminently appeared in the preſervation of this great Inſtrument and Protector of the <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion,</hi> give him a wiſe, and underſtanding Heart to govern this People, whom he hath ſent to ſave, in ſuch a Miraculous, and extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: And bleſs their Majeſties with a Long, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Proſperous <hi>Reign</hi> in this World, and Crown them with Eternal Glory, and Immortality in the next. <hi>Amen.</hi>
