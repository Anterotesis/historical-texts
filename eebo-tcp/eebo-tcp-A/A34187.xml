            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Bishop of <hi>LONDON</hi>'s Ninth CONFERENCE With his CLERGY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAving at several times formerly taken notice of so many of the Subjects of these Injunctions as concern the Clergy in general, except these two: I thought it might not be amiss to desire your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon them; especially since the Vanity of being thought Good natured, too often tempts Men to forget the discharge of a good Conscience, and the easiness of Complaisance draws them into those things which are not Convenient, but sometimes Scandalous.</p>
            <p>I. The Words of the Fifth Injunction run thus. <q>That that part of the <hi>34th.</hi> Canon, which relates to the giving<note place="margin">Injunct. 5.</note> of Certificates, concerning the Lives and Manners of those who are to be Ordained, be strictly looked to. And that the Bishops lay it on the Consciences of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62761:3"/>
Clergy, that they sign no Certificates, unless, upon their own knowledg, they judge the Persons to be duly Qualified.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The words of the Canon, so far as this Injunction is<note place="margin">Can. 34.</note> grafted upon it, are these: <q>Except he shall then exhibit Letters Testimonial of his good Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Seal of some College in <hi>Cambridge or Oxford,</hi> where before he remained, or of three or four grave Ministers, together with the Subscription and Testimony of other Credible Persons, who have known his Life and Behaviour by the space of Three Years next before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Church had several occasions for Letters recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory and Testimonials for the Security and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her Discipline, according to the exigence of different Ages, as well for the brotherly and hospitable Reception of those that travel'd into Forain Jurisdictions, as for the satisfaction of those Churches they went to, that they might not be Imposed upon by False Brethren. These were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> They<note place="margin">2. Cor 3. 1. Rom. 16. 1. <hi>Can. Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> 33.</note> were afterwards called <hi>Literae Canonicae,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Formatae.</hi> Of which you have a learned discourse written by <hi>Priorius</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Philippi Priorii de li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Canonicis dissertatio. Paris. 1675 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
               </note> But I believe you would be more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the reason and authority of this sort of Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als from the Canons of the Catholick Church, <note n="b" place="margin">Canones Ecclesiae Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versae Iustelli.

               </note> under the four first General Councils. Which gave ground to those so many and divers directions afterwards in the following particular Councils of several Nations. But this were too large a Work, and too much beside our purpose to be treated of at this time.</p>
            <p>We will therefore confine our selves to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of those Letters Dimissory and Testimonials only,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62761:3"/>
as relate to such as seek to enter into holy Orders. And this I conceive will appear in the best light, if we proceed by these Three steps.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. To look into the Appointment of them.</item>
               <item>II. To examine the Reason of that Appointment.</item>
               <item>III. To apply that Reason to our Behaviour in this particular.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. As to the Appointment, it is so obvious a method to come to the knowledge of any thing otherwise out of our reach: that without question it must have been the universal Practice of all Ages. But it will suffice us to keep within the compass of our own Profession.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> directed the People to find out fit Men to be Rulers over them, amongst other Enquiries, he would have them expect good Testimonials from their Neighbours<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 13.</note> and Acquaintance. <hi>Take ye wise men and understanding, and known among your Tribes.</hi> When the Apostles instituted Deacons, they gave this charge to the Disciples, <hi>Look ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 6. 3.</note> 
               <hi>out among ye seven men of honest report.</hi> We see the reason given, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> took <hi>Timothy</hi> forth with him, because<note place="margin">Act. 6. 2. 1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1.</note> 
               <hi>he was well reported of by the Brethren that were at</hi> Lystra <hi>and</hi> Iconium. The Characters St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of such as are to be admitted to the Orders of Bishops, Priests or Deacons, shews the necessity of good Testimonials: because many of those Particulars upon which that Character depended, could not otherwise be so well made out. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">1. Tim 3. 7. v. 10.</note> he says, A Bishop <hi>must have a good report of them which are without.</hi> And of Deacons, <hi>Let these also first</hi>

               <hi>be proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62761:4"/>In conformity to this necessary Method of proceeding has the Church practised ever since. So it was in St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi>

            <p>II. Therefore it may be convenient in the second place to look into the Reasons of this cautious Proceeding. And truly they are so natural, that it is impossible they should bear any Debate. For common Reason tells us, we must take our Information from others in those things, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice whereof we cannot attain to by our selves: and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches us to have a care whom we believe. So that where a Testimony is required, we are to receive it with great Wariness. Now that part of satisfaction relating to Life and Conversation, which ought to be had before Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are admitted into Holy Orders, generally cannot be come by without sufficient Testimonials. Which how cautiously they should be admitted, appears plainly from the ill consequences of a Mistake in this kind. For</p>

            <p>If then we put all Considerations together, and consider how abominable in the sight of God and how pernicious to men the disorderly walking of those who are admitted into Holy Orders, would be: what care has or can the Church take, which may prove too much to prevent so great an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil!</p>
            <p>III. Therefore ye see of how weighty a Concern it is, that ye behave yourselves uprightly in giving Testimonials to those who are to serve at the Altar, that neither Fear, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Affection, nor Indifference prevail with you to give a rash, much less a false Certificate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62761:5"/>If any Man should recommend an Officer to the State at all Adventures or out of Partiality, and this Man should prove any ways unfit for his Employment: would it not bring Shame upon the Voucher, and a publick Curse for his unadvised Officiousness? What an unneighbourly part is it to put a Servant upon another Man, whose Faults we know, or at least are ignorant of his Vertues? It is unkind and unjust at the best, and may prove barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. What Name then can we give that Action which imposes an unfaithful Servant upon the Church of God, where his Honour and the eternal Concern of his Creature's Soul is engaged, and endanger the Death of so many as he would save alive.</p>
            <p>I will charitably hope, that no Man is wilfully guilty of a Transgression of this Nature. But we are apt to be of too easie a Disposition in this Case: and either out of an unwillingness to disoblige a Friend, or a desire to please him, or for some particular Kindness, or thro' an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate Easiness, to flatter ourselves with a General Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that all is well; and so yield to a blind Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Indeed if such sort of Frailties might plead Prescription by being common; I know not any may bid fairer for it, than this: but the ill Consequences are such, as admit of no Excuse. For the Fitness of the Person to be admitted, as to his Morals, depends so entirely for the most part upon the Integrity of the Testimonial: that a Failure on this side renders the Certifier partaker of another Mans Sins, by loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ordinance of God with so heavy and so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a Scandal. In effect it is a lying to God, if unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly we recommend an ill Man to his Service.</p>

            <p>II. The Injunction we have hither to conferred upon, is to keep safe the Door of the Church; that none be admitted to enter into it, but such as are fit for the Ministry: this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to admonish such as are already entred; that they walk as in the sight of God, and do not by an unwary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour bring reproach upon his Service. The Injunction is this. <q>That the Bishops shall look to the Lives and<note place="margin">Injunction 10.</note> Manners of their Clergy, that they may be in all things regular and exemplary according to the <hi>75th.</hi> Canon.</q> The Canon upon which this is grafted runs thus. <q>No<note place="margin">Can. 75.</note> Ecclesiastical Persons shall at any time, other than for<note place="margin">Injunctions given by the Queen, in the Year 1559.

Furthermore they shall not give themselves to any base or servile Labour, or to Drinking or Riot, spending their Time idly by Day or by Night, playing at Dice, Cards, or Tables, or any other unlawful Game: but at all times convenient, they shall hear or read somewhat of the Holy Scriptures, or shall occupy themselves with some other Honest Study or Exercise, always doing the things which shall appertain to Honesty, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to profit the Church of God, having always in Mind that they ought to excel all others in Purity of Life, and should be Examples to the People to live well and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly, under pain of Ecclesiastical Censures to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with severity, according to the Qualities of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62761:6"/>Whenever ye read over, as I hope sometimes ye do, the Exhortation that goes before the Questions in the Form for Ordaining Priests; ye will there find the Matter of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non treated in a fuller and more Pathetick Stile. Not at all to derogate from the Expression of the Canon. For Laws we know, ought to be in as few and plain Words as may be: whereas Advices upon those Laws, have a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to enforce the Reasonableness of them by the most powerful Arguments that can be sound out, and to apply the most prevailing Inducements for their Observation.</p>
            <p>The main Scope of this Canon seems to be a negative Direction to the Clergy, that they should not be guilty of such and such Irregularities, which are of the most noisy sort and give the most Publick Scandal. For however there may be others, as Covetousness, Ill nature or the like, that may cry as loud against us at the last day: yet those<note place="margin">Luke 16. 15</note> enumerated in the Canon are of a more clamourous kind in this World. But these are not all of the same nature. For some are absolutely unlawful as Drunkenness and all sorts of Riot: others are so only by accident, as Cards, Dice, Taverns and Alehouses.</p>
            <p>The former seems not fitting to be taken notice of upon this occasion. For we are not to imagin, that any of our Brethren can be guilty of such gross Misdemeanours, as would render them the most unfortunate of Mankind. The wretched State such Ill Habits bring both upon Body and Mind is the least to be considered. Were it barely the disreputation of such courses, which to an Ingenuous Man is more grievous, than the loss of Life; it were but a light matter, in comparison of those dismal Consequences, which attend such disorders. Nay the Scandal, take it alone, is nothing when compared with the effects of it. <hi>Hinc illae
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62761:7"/>
lachryme;</hi> here lies the Transcendency of the Mischief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Dishonour to God and his Worship, it staggers the Believer, it drives the weak Brother out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, giving great occasion for Schism, confirms the Dissolute, and makes the Atheist triumph. Therefore I say, we ought rather to presume, that such destructive Vices can never take Root amongst us: than by Dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from what may be, cause Unwary and Malicious Men to conclude, that the Plague is already begun, and so bring a present Obloquy upon the Function. I wish therefore I have not said too much upon this point. I will say no more: but proceed to those other Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are so by Accident.</p>
            <p>These we find to be of Two sorts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Such as relate to matters absolutely Prohibited.</item>
               <item>II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as are only so Conditionally.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. The things absolutely prohibited in this Case are Cards, Dice and Tables: not as meerly unlawful in themselves, but of such a nature as for good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be forbidden. For at the best they can no way turn to any profitable account, only serve to amuse at very Idle Hours. And then they are apt to draw on such Mischievous and Wicked Consequences; that if from the experience of such ill Effects, our Governours should not have power to Restrain the Cause, they would be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from answering one of the greatest ends of their Appointment. And therefore it is absolutely necessary, that they have a Power, in Prudence to with-hold us from what is Dangerous: as in Justice to forbid what is simply Evil. An Army otherwise would be in a desperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62761:7"/>
especially when near an Enemy, where the Loss or Gain of an opportunity is so ticklish, and for the most part so irrecoverable: if we should allow such Privileges to be disputed. And tho in the Civil Administration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the mischief of such a Licentiousness would not so quickly be felt: yet, like a lingring Disease, it would grow more and more uneasie to the State, till the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ruin of the other.</p>
            <p>In the things therefore that pertain unto Godliness, where the loss is not Transitory and Finite, but Eternal; how much more ready ought we to be, in owning that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which would keep us out of Harms-way! For as I said before, Gaming is a Diversion that can do no Good, it is at best but an Idle Amusement, it may do much Harm. The temptations it carries with it are many and dangerous. If it proceed not at first from a covetous inclination, it seldom fails of concluding in it (<note n="a" place="margin">Whoever would read at large the shameful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this loose sort of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, with the just characters of Theft, Robbery and the like that it is stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with; let him consult Tractat. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctar. Paridis de Puteo &amp; aliorum de lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. Num. 1. &amp;c. fol. 151 &amp;c. Tom. 7.</note>). And this frequently upon ill fortune causes great Passion, which often breaks out into Cursing and Swearing, sometimes attended with such horrid Blasphemies as would be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to name. Besiyes it creates Quarrels, that are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found guilty of Murder. And after all this, we see so clearly from constant experience, how natural it is to run into these Inconveniencies: that we may safely say, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ventures upon this Liberty, runs himself into such Temptations, as he knows not where they will end.</p>
            <p>No wonder then if we meet with restrictive Laws in those places, where these Idle Divertisements have been followed. Our own Laws are an Instance, where in (<note n="b" place="margin">33. H. 8. c: 9.</note>) one of them notice is taken of the many precedent Laws against them: and particularly they are forbid, not only as unprofitable, but as effeminating the persons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62761:8"/>
in them. For they are observed to hinder those Manly and useful exercises of Arching and the like, which prepare Mens Bodies for Agility in War, and Vigour in other Employments for the Publick Good. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <note n="a" place="margin">23. Ph. &amp; m. c. 9.</note> is very short, but yet complains of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects of such prohibited Games, whereby Idle and Dissolute Persons are drawn together, and take that occasion to contrive Robberies and other Villanies. The last <note n="b" place="margin">16. Car. 2. c. 5.</note> is to prevent the fatal consequences which fall often upon whole Families, whose Fortunes are fairly or fowly Impaired, if not Ruined, by the Extravagancies and Folly of a Young Heir, and many times by those that should have more Wit. And to shew that it is no new thing, we may find the like caution taken in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes, see the <hi>Roman</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Asia</hi> at his leisure hours recreated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Gardens, and sometimes diverted himself in Casting of Statues. It is said of <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</hi> that his Pastime was spent in making Warlike Engines: and of <hi>Europus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that at his spare hours he made Lights. It is reported that the Kings of <hi>Parthia</hi> were used to spend their idle hours in Sharpning of Spears. And <hi>Dionysius</hi> the younger, when he was at Peace, would contrive little Wains, Seats and Tables with wonderful Art. I suppose the custom of the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Emperours, who always take some Handicraft Employment upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62761:8"/>
them, is upon the same ground, to invite their Subjects by such examples to spend their spare time in something that may be Profitable. To this end the <hi>Romans</hi> encourag'd none but such Games as consisted in manly and robust Exercise, which for the number were called <hi>Pentathlum:</hi> that no time might be lost, but their very Sports might make them Active and Hardy for time of War. And if that purpose failed, they were sure to get Health and Vigour by it, besides the avoiding the many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Idleness, or the other effeminate Divertisements.</p>
            <p>Now of all Men it most behoves us of the Clergy to walk Circumspectly in these matters, as appears by the Apostolick <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 24.</note> Canon. For we are set up as Lights to Guide the People: and where Laws are made upon such weighty Motives, as those abovementioned, we ought very carefully to set a good Example, by paying our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Obedience to them. If the Blood of him, who<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 8.</note> Dses in his Wickedness, and whom we have not forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, shall be required at our Hands: how much more<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 22.</note> shall we be answerable for his Transgressions, whom we our selves have misled by our unwary Behaviour! Of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> has warned us in his advice to <hi>Timothy, Be not partaker of other Mens Sins.</hi> But after all it seems to be superfluous, and I hope it is (tho <hi>ahundans cautela non nocet</hi>) to warn those that serve at the Altar, to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in having to do with such things, as oftentimes causes so great Offence and Scandal. Especially since the duty of our Abstinence should carry us far beyond these considerations: even by denying ourselves, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, those things which may be both Lawful and Useful for us. Thus we find S. <hi>Paul</hi> governing himself,<note place="margin">1: Cor. 10. 23. <hi>Non omne, quod licet, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestum est.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:

all things are lawful for me, but all things edifie not.</hi> And what he prescribes to himself, in the following part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he gives as a Rule to all Christians under the particular case of Meats offered to Idols.</p>
            <p>If what has been said, seems to bear too hard upon<note place="margin">Deteriores om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sumus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiâ Ter. Heaut.</note> this point: to be sure it is an Error on the safest-side; and will easily be pardoned by all, that are worthy to have it asked at their hands. For Liberty, especially in things of this kind, is like an edged tool: which if not skilfully managed, cuts the Fingers, if not the Throat of him that uses it.</p>
            <p>II. The other Prohibition is conditional: because the thing forbid is only so occasionally. For Publick-Houses are necessary for Travellers and Way-Faring People, and convenient many times for meeting upon common Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. But, as many things appointed for good Ends are abused, so none more shamefully than these. That which was appointed for Refreshment, is made the receptacle of Idleness and Debauchery: and that which is allowed for honest Purposes, is too frequently made use of to contrive Mischief. However, the design of the Canon in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is to warn us of two Dangers; the one relating to our Selves, and the other to our Neighbour. Both nicely to be observed, and subjected to that caution of <hi>Tully,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Est aliquid quod non opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, etiamsi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. Cic. Orat. 3. pro Corn. Balbo.</note> 
               <hi>There are some things which ought not to be done, tho they be Lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. In relation to our Selves we should consider very well, what sort of Company we are like to meet with in those Publick-Houses, before we go to them. Whether we may not be drawn into a complaisance that may go
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62761:9"/>
beyond Discretion. For if your Company be given to Excess, it is the Interest of those places to promote it, and by consequence they will be sure to do it. Besides there is another reason should make us wary, how we comply with invitations to such Houses; lest by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness in yielding to importunities of this kind, we insensibly steal into an Idle Habit; and instead of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Complyance, when we are asked the question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at last forward to attack others. <hi>Nemo repentè fit turpissimus:</hi> but it is so natural to advance in Folly, that, unless a Man keep a strict hand upon himself, the Clowd which seem'd but as a Hand at first, may in a little time draw such a Storm after it, as may Overwhelm those that come in its way. Now the ready course for a Man to avoid the Danger of these Temptations, is to take up a firm Resolution never to go into any of those Houses, when it may reasonably be avoided. For such a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once well fix'd, will keep him always upon his Guard; and he will never do the thing, till he sees a very good or necessary reason for it.</p>
            <p>II. The care we ought to have upon this account in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our Neighbour, is neither to set him an ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, nor give him Offence by abusing our Liberty. It gives too just a cause of suspition to be seen in disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Company, tho' we be ever so Sober our selves: and it is never to be excused from setting a very Ill Example, if we unduly or too frequently haunt these places. Indeed the Abuses committed in them are so Scandalous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous; that I should think no consideration likelier to make us wise in this regard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62761:10"/>For it must be confessed, that Idleness and Tipling are Faults, wherever they are found: but in Publick-Houses they are doubly Scandalous and Shameful, because they are lyable so much more to expose to the View and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all the World. Therefore it is no new thing to see such matters animadverted upon. <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Tradit historicus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Claudium Caesarem Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponas, inquas poturi diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerent, solvisse. Cael. Rhod. l. 27. Col. 1492.</note> put down all Tipling-Houses. And if our Antient Laws take no notice of these matters; it is, because <hi>England,</hi> generally speaking, was a Sober Nation, till the Fashion was brought over from Forein Parts, where better things might have been learnt. But when once this evil Practice took place amongst us, the Inconveniencies were so many, the Scandals so gross and the Mischief, to the Publick so apparent, that you will find from that date nothing more strictly directed to be look'd after, nor attended with quicker Penalties upon the Offender, nor oftner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated than the Laws which animadvert upon those that unnecessarily haunt such Publick-Houses or that are the keepers of them; as well as those that are taken in actual disorder. <note n="b" place="margin">1. Iac. c. 9 4. Iac. c. 4. 7. Iac c. 10. 2. Iac. c. 7. 1. Car. c. 4. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Car. c. 3. §. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum of all is this. It is justly expected, that the Honour of God, the Service of his Church and Good of Mens Souls should be always upon our Minds, when we give Testimonials for those that are to serve in Gods House: that neither for Fear nor Favour, but as in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science we may answer before God and Man for the Truth of what we certifie. As being well assured, if through Negligence or Easiness we Subscribe to what we are not well apprised of from our own experience; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever harm comes by the unfitness or Scandal of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so recommended, we shall be deeply partakers of the Guilt of it, besides the great blame of Rashness in a matter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62761:10"/>
of that Importance. And as for avoiding offence we are to abstain from <hi>all appearance of Evil:</hi> so especially are we obliged not to engage our selves in those things, which are of Ill Report.

            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to set down the substance of our Conference upon these two important Injunctions. Which when I weigh, with the Charge that lies upon us for their due Execution, I Tremble to think of the account we are to give.
