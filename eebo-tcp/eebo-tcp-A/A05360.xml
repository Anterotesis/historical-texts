            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

good Lady, after I had peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

it to be very neceſſary, to be turned into

Church. I therefore as occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerued at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient

vvherein I haue ſtudied to be as ſimple and

eſteeme it the greateſt, to hange vppon the

holy Scripture the ſignification and vſe of this
worde (Righteouſneſſe) is farre different from
that which is vſurped in the bookes of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
and ſchoolemen: becauſe they take
righteouſneſſe, for a certaine habite and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which being encloſed in our minde, encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs to liue honeſtly, and in ſuch ſorte to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the courſe of all our actions, that they be
entirelie conformable to reaſon, and to thoſe
rules that are ſette out vnto vs in the Lawe.
A thinge that we can not doe perfectly, ſeeing
that we are loaden and compaſſed about with
ſo greate infirmitie, and for that our nature
beinge ſo diſeaſed and corrupted, it yrcketh
vs, and wholy turneth vs, from the loue, ſtudy
and exerciſe of that which is good: and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
and ſtirreth vs vp to the quite contrary, to
embrace and followe vice, with a meruelous
will and readyneſſe. Adde hereunto, that we
are driuen and ledde in this caſe by many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and aſſaultes, wherewith the fleſh, the
worlde and deuill doe continually aſſaile vs.
Wherfore we muſt conclude, that in the whole
worlde, there can neuer be founde a righteous
man if righteouſneſſe be to be meaſured accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that definition, which the philoſophers
haue giuen: and that it be eſtabliſhed, in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

thinking at any time that this is any meane to
make vs to be accompted righteous before
God, in whoſe preſence and iudgement all our

if they be examined according to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour

            <p>To vnderſtande then what this Chriſtian
righteouſnes is, and in what it conſiſteth, it is
meete to note, that Righteouſneſſe and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are corelatyues, and for the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the one, it muſt be layde and ioyned
with the other.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4. 5.</note> The which thing maye eaſely
be obſerued in many places of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where righteouſnes is ioyned with iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and iuſtification with righteouſnes.

there, that we can defende vs, if we

but our owne innocencie: foraſmuch as our

&amp; generally our whole life and nature

able to ſuſteine, the rigorous examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
righteouſnes of God, and that in vs and in our
whole life there is nothinge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can in this caſe
defende &amp; deliuer vs but his mercy alone. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are as the Prophet ſayeth,<note place="margin">Oſee 2. 3.</note> a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
altogether couered with thiſtles, bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

            <p>The beginning then of our righteouſnes is,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to knowe our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes.</note>
that we accuſe and condempne our ſelues, and
that we confeſſe before God that (which he

            <p>The prodigall childe being farre from his

            <p>The publican comming to the temple loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7081:7"/>
righteous into his owne houſe.</p>
            <p>After Dauid &amp; holy Peter were falne from
God,<note place="margin">3. Example of Dauid and of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> through a great vnkindnes &amp; ignorance,

they any other meane to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled vnto him,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 62.</note>
but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acknowledgement &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of their

this we muſt approche before God. And that
there is nothinge that doth more allure &amp; knit
vs to him, then a penitent heart which (as S.
Auguſtine ſayth) feeleth and continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
for his ſinnes and imperfections.</p>
            <p>This humility is not onely the foundation
of our righteouſneſſe (as Iohn Chriſoſtome
ſaith) but alſo of all our religion,<note place="margin">The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our miſeries is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our religion.</note> the which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth

of our ſelues or of our owne vertues. He
(ſayth S. Auguſtine) will not be any longer
of the body, that refuſeth to be humble, and to
make himſelfe litle with his head: for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
as the valleyes are more aboundant and
bringe foorth more frute then doe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the good that commeth of humility.</note>
by reaſon that being more low, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
more commodiouſly all the fatnes which
falleth and deſcendeth from the hie hilles: euen
ſo it behoueth that we be more low and humble
in our owne eyes,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 15. 17</note> if we will, that God fullfill
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7081:7"/>
vs with his graces: the which may finde no
place in vs, if we preſume any whit of our
vertues. The ſame which Chriſt ſayth to thoſe
Scribes and Phariſeis, when he ſaw them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
and preſumptuous, and puffed vp with
a vaine and falſe opinion, that they had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of their owne righteouſneſſe: you iuſtifie
your ſelues before men, ſayth he to them: but
God knoweth your heartes within,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 15.</note> before
whom, they are moſt abhominable, that are in

            <p>Wherfore where there is any queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
righteouſnes,<note place="margin">Pride is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our helth.</note> we muſt diligently take

            <p>That then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward appearance which we

may be furniſhed, can no more endure before
God, then waxe before the fire. And as it can
not be but that one pinne or needle is enough
to pearce a bladder, and to make all the winde
therein incloſed, incontinently to come foorth:
euen ſo it can not be, but that euen a litle tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7081:8"/>
is enough to drawe the vizard from hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
&amp; to diſcouer them to euery one, who
ſhall knowe, after that they ſhalbe ſifted, that
there was nothing but a colour and an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of all the reputation of righteouſnes &amp;
vertue, which they had gotten amongeſt men.</p>
            <p>Lette vs not make then any accompt of all
the righteouſnes which can be in vs, nor let vs
not bring it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our God, to better
our cauſe, or to winne there by lawe any thing
for vs. Foraſmuch as there was neuer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe of the ruine of the Iewes, nor any
thinge that ouerthrewe them, and made them
fruſtrate of the hope they had to attaine to the
righteouſneſſe which they pretended,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> but the
only preſumptuous opinion they had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be able to appeare there, through their
owne righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>Now to the end we faule not headlong into
the like daunger and inconuenience, let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and feele in our ſelues, that we are
not able to thinke one onely good thought,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 5.</note> but
let vs be reſolued in this, that all our ability is
from the alone grace and bounty of our God.
For all our glory (as S. Paul ſayth) is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27. &amp; 5. 2.</note>
and we haue not any thinge in our ſelues,
whereof we may boaſt our ſelues.</p>
            <p>For beinge naturally deade in ſinne as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7081:8"/>
we are,<note place="margin">Arguments to proue the corruption &amp; vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of man, before God.</note> can we haue any good motion or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge?
But it is certaine that before our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and before we be called through the
grace of God to the knowledge of him: we are
blinde and can not ſee any whitte of the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

deaffe and can not heare his voice:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> we are ſicke

walke in his waies:<note place="margin">Ezec. 11. 12. 19. and 36. 26.</note> we haue an harte of ſtone.
which bringeth foorth no good affection: and
a mouth full of bitternes and curſſing, and we
are as a graue within, from whence commeth
nothinge but ſtenche and corruption:<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 13.</note> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
we are altogether deade, depriued of all
good, in ſuch ſorte, that we haue not any good
vſe of our reaſon. Let no man flatter him ſelfe
(ſayth S. Auguſtine) foraſmuch as we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our ſelues but deuills &amp; Sathans:<note place="margin">Auguſtine vpon Iohn.</note> that
is to ſay of our owne nature, we are enemies
of God, of his honour, of his lawe, and of all
vertue: and there is not any other difference
betwixt vs and Deuills, but the onely pittie,
which God hath vnto vs, and the gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
which he woulde ſhewe vs. And although
God haue accepted of vs, and that being recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into his couenaunt, we are conſecrated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him to be his temple: notwithſtanding all
theſe great &amp; incomprehenſible fauours which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7081:9"/>
he hath ſhewed vs, we ought not vtterly to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the remembrance which we ought alwaies
to haue of our horrible corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the ende to repreſſe our preſumption, &amp;
to let, that we forgette not what is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our nature, putteth vs continually in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce,<note place="margin">Ioſue. 40. 6.</note>
that we and all fleſh are nothing
but graſſe, wormes meate, duſt, and filth, as
Dauid ſayth that God knoweth vs,<note place="margin">Pſa. 103. 14</note> &amp; whereof
we are made: and that to be briefe, we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
but duſt and putrefaction: yea that the

all their commodity &amp; bewty,<note place="margin">Pſa. 62. 10</note> which men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
are nothinge but vanity: and that if they
were put into the ballaunce to be wayed with
nothing, nothing would be found heauier then
they. Beinge then ſo noted in the Scripture,
yea when we are ſo adorned and enriched with
the great &amp; precious gifts of our God: in what
eſtimation ſhall we haue righteouſnes and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
whereof we thinke to haue ſo great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>We do as marchaunts,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to ſhew the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and miſery of man.</note> who alwaies praiſe
and eſteeme their wares &amp; marchaundiſe more
then they are worth: euen ſo do we of our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
but when they are examined and priſed
by thoſe which knowe them, as by the ſpirit of
God and his Prophetes, they are altogether
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7081:9"/>
as olde ragges, torne tyed together &amp; patched:
&amp; as old images new gilded ouer, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
haue ſome gliſtering &amp; ſhew, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are nothinge but duſt &amp; durt: or, as counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite

a printe ſoeuer it haue.<note place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scriptures, &amp; Fathers to proue the vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of man before God.</note> All our righteouſneſſes
ſaith Eſay are as olde ragges, foule and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to ſee. S. Paule albeit he walked in the
law, without rebuke, and that he felt himſelfe
not culpable in any thing in his conſcience nor
willingly to haue tranſgreſſed: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge
he eſteemeth his righteouſneſſe as
dongue. Daniell praying vnto God, alleageth
not his owne righteouſnes &amp; vertues,<note place="margin">Philip. 3. 8.</note> neither
the righteouſneſſe &amp; vertues of his compagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 5.</note>
to the ende to cauſe God to encline, and to
heare his prayers. Now (ſayth he) that we are
before thy face, we can ſet nothing before thee,
nor propound any thing on our part but ſhame
and confuſion.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Curſed (ſayth Auguſtine) be all
our righteouſneſſes, if they be iudged without
the mercy of God.<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> And Tertullian: All the
good that we do (ſayth he) and all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and vertue which is in vs, is nothinge
but ſhame and reproch.</p>
            <p>When they ſpake theſe thinges, it was not
without great reaſon, becauſe there is no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
and vertue in vs, which is not defiled
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7081:10"/>
&amp; polluted with great vices. Alſo, there is not
any faith, which is not mingled with an infinite
number of doubtes, errours and fonde imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
nor likewiſe, any godlines which is not
contaminate with innumerable ſcruples and
ſuperſtitions. To conclude: all our wine (as
Eſay ſayth) is mingled with water,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 22.</note> and all our
corne is full of darnell and durt.</p>
            <p>Now if a man woulde boaſt of his ſtrength
and helth,<note place="margin">Theſe ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes and other follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, ſhew the beaſtly pride of them, that thinke to haue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues wherewith all to ſtand before God.</note> and yet were ſubiect to a thouſande
diſeaſes: or of his knowledge, and yet were
ignorant of all good learning: or of his ritches,
and yet were indebted and indaungered to the
whole world: woulde not euery one mocke him
as an idiote and a foole? euen ſo we aſwell ſhew
our ignoraunce, and what ſclender vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
we haue, when we wil attribute any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
to our ſelues, and boaſte our ſelues in
it, be it neuer ſo litle.</p>
            <p>He that is ſtronge (ſayth Ieremie) let him
not boaſte and preſume of his ſtrength,<note place="margin">Iere. 9. 23.</note> nor he
that is wiſe of his wiſedom, nor he that is ritch
of his ritches, becauſe that, if we conſider what
we haue on the one ſyde, we muſt marke what
we lacke on the other. And when all ſhalbe
well caſte, it ſhall be founde that the expence
will farre ſurmounte the receipt, and the debtes
are much greater, then the reuenue. Moreouer,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7081:10"/>
all that is greateſt vnder the Sunne, and that
which men moſt wonder at and worſhip in the
worlde,<note place="margin">Eccle. 4. 2. &amp; 1. 1.</note> is nothing elſe (as Solomon ſayeth)
but vanitie. Is there any thing ſo ſtable and
durable, which is not mutable, tranſitory, and
vncertaine? what madnes then is it to make ſo
great a matter and ſo highely to eſteeme of our
ſelues, for thinges of ſo ſmall valewe? we are
oftentimes like to thoſe that dreame and wake
againe,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> who when they are a ſleape thinke to
haue founde ſome great treaſure, and haue a
great ioye in it: but after their wakening, they
ſee that all is vaniſhed like ſmoke, whereupon
they vexe &amp; greiue themſelues. Likewiſe when
we thinke that we are righteous, this is a
dreame, which paſſeth through our ſpirits and
vaniſheth aſſoone as we are awake and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from the darkenes of ignorance, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were a ſleape and buried. S. Paule whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
he was ignoraunt, without a true and right
knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe,<note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Paul before his conuerſion.</note> thought to be righteous,
and feelt not ſinne any whitte raigning in him,
vntill that God by his grace, had illuminated
him, &amp; made his will by the lawe knowen vnto
him, &amp; ſo conſequently the luſtes, &amp; corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
was in his nature. The which made him ſoone
enough to forgoe the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
of his owne righteouſnes and vertues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:7081:11"/>
After that we haue well ſwept our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,<note place="margin">An other ſimilitude.</note>
it ſeemeth vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are very cleane.
And yet notwithſtanding, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
to enter there by the windowes, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
ſtreight waies by the beames an infinite
deale of duſt, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſophers call motes:
euen ſo oftentimes before we be wel inſtructed
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God, if we be exempted from groſſe
&amp; palpable ſinnes, ſuch as are murthers, whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
theftes, we glorie that we are perfect
and innocent. But when our conſciences come
to be diſcried by the word of God, &amp; that Ieſus
Chriſt who is the light hath entred there by
his ſpirite: then he maketh vs to ſee by his
beames an infinite number of faultes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
which are hidden in our heartes,
as are the ſerpentes in their holes.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> S. Paule
ſayth that he neuer vnderſtoode, that concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
was a vice, vntil he had ſeene in the law,
that it was there forbidden. Yea, but hadde he
not learned this in the ſchoole of Gamaliel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his conuerſion? I graunt, as concerninge
the outwarde barke and ſuperficially. But he
had not attained yet to the bottome, the which
we can not do, vntill we haue ben in the ſchoole
of Ieſus Chriſt, whoe in the law wil make vs
truely to know both God and our ſelues, euen
as the ſunne ſhining by his brightnes maketh
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7081:11"/>
vs to ſee it ſelfe, and all thinges with it.</p>
            <p>In the night by reaſon of the darkeneſſe
ſpreade vpon the earth,<note place="margin">An other ſimilitude.</note> all thinges are hidde
and couered: which cauſeth that we can not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
and diſcouer the ſpottes which we haue
in our faces: But when the light beginneth to
appeare, and that we take a glaſſe, to beholde
our ſelues therin: then they are diſcouered and
ſhewe themſelues: euen ſo likewiſe during the
time that we are couered with the darkenes of
ignoraunce, the vices that dwell in vs, are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
there, and oftentimes we thinke, being
leprous &amp; deformed, that we are bewtifull and
perfect: but our eyes being open, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
by the ſpirite and grace of our God, and
taking the glaſſe of the law, therein to beholde
the eſtate of our nature and our life: then we
beginne to knowe the great and greuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
that are in vs: and we attonce looſe
the opinion which we had conceaued before, of
our owen righteouſnes and vertues.</p>
            <p>We are oftentimes like vnto drounkardes
who being ouercharged with wine and meate,<note place="margin">An other ſimilitude.</note>
haue no maner of knowledge or feeling of the
caſe wherin they are, nor of any thing elſe, and
yet hauing their face couered, and all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed
with durt, they canne not perceaue it
vntill that their wine be drienched, and their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7081:12"/>
braine deliuered from thoſe fumes and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
wherby they were ſo letted, &amp; darkened.
We likewiſe, before we be regenerate, are in
ſuch ſorte beſotted with a loue that we beare to
our ſelues, and with a vaine opinion that we
haue conceaued of our ſelues, that we know not
the filthyneſſe and vilanies wherwith we are
berayed. But when the lighte of the ſpirite and
word of God beginnes to breake forth vnto vs,
we come by litle and litle to breake and ſcatter
thoſe cloudes, which were before our ſenſes,
and recouering the view of our reaſon, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to awake our ſelues, and diſcouer the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiefull
and miſerable eſtate wherin we are. And
looke as this knowledge groweth and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in vs, ſo much the more it augmenteth and
encreaſeth the knowledge of our vices and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, Prophetes and Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: in whom they ſought their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.</note>
As we may ſee by experience in
the fathers, who though they were notable and
excellent perſonages, and marked with all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vertues: yet notwithſtanding they made
no accompt of them: but contrarywiſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that they were the greateſt ſinners in the
worlde as a man maye ſee by thoſe goodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
which the ſcripture mentioneth, to
haue bin made of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Ieremie, Daniell, S. Paule, S. Iohn,
and generally of the whole Church: by which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7081:12"/>
we woulde iudge them to haue bene the moſt
wicked men, which were vpon the earth, if we
knew not the humilitie, that was in them, and
in what contempt they had them ſelues and
their workes, for the great knowledge they
had of the lawe of God: the which engendred
in them an other thinge, to wit, the knowledge
of the imperfection which was in them and in
their life, when they came to meaſure it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule of the lawe, &amp; brought all their

            <p>We ſaye in a common prouerbe, that ſuch a
one as thinketh himſelfe in beſt health, carieth
death in his boſome. Which muſt not onely be
vnderſtood of the bodely helth, but alſo of the
health of the ſoule.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude taken of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prouerbe.</note> For the diſeaſes of the body
are nothing ſo dangerous, as thoſe of the ſoule:
becauſe that verie many (albeit their hartes
are full of diſtruſtes, doubtinges, errors, falſe
opinions, ingratitudes, enuies, reuengements,
darkenes, ignorance, and other deadely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes)
neuertheles they thinke them ſelues
in very good health, and that their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is ſufficient to enable them, to aunſwer
and ſatisfie the iudgement of God. As that
prowde Phariſe,<note place="margin">Luc 8. 11.</note> who in ſteade of humbling
himſelfe before God &amp; confeſſing this faultes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7081:13"/>
to him ſetteth forthe and extolleth his owen
workes,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 20</note> in his prayer: And the Scribe that
bragged, that he had accompliſhed the whole
law:<note place="margin">Iere. 2. 23.</note> and the Sinagogue, that boaſted her ſelfe,
of her owen innocency, and in that, that ſhe had
not ſinned. Wherefore God cauſed complainte
to be made againſt her, to conuince her of hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
and of the ſinnes, that ſhe had forgotten,
through negligence, and of the loue, that ſhe
ought to haue borne vnto him.</p>
            <p>Although then that God doth not alwayes
diſcouer our faultes wholly vnto vs, he wil not
therefore that we make light of them: but if we
do, he ſtreight wayes calleth vs to a reckning,
and requireth them of vs, and conſtraineth vs
to confeſſe them vnto him, that he may forgiue
vs: to the ende, that we maye haue occaſion
hereby, to acknowledge and ſet forth his great
liberalitie. And this is all that he requireth and
demaundeth of vs for hauing acquited and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
vs of ſuch a great and notable ſumme,
wherein we were indebted to him. For looke
how much ſoeuer of the glorie of any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and vertue we attribute to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
ſo muche we diminiſhe of the bountie
and liberalitie of our God, and we prouoke
him to ielouſie, becauſe we beare him not that
loue, nor reuerence, that we owe vnto him,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7081:13"/>
but doe more loue our owen honour then his.
And euen like as a houſband louing his wife
tenderly,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> (to make his affection knowen vnto
her, beſtowing vpon her many great preſentes
of golde and coſtly iewelles,) is verie heauie if
ſhe diſſemble the gifts which he hath beſtowed
vpon her, and ſaye ſhe hath purchaſed them by
her owen mony: Euen ſo God can in no wiſe be
pleaſed with vs, if we will conceale or els attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to our ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graces which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon vs, which he woulde haue to be

            <p>Moiſes ſaide vnto the people of Iſrael, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
they were yet in the wildernes: When

promiſed to thy fathers, and ſhalt haue taken
poſſeſſion thereof, and peaceably enioye the
fruictes and delicate thinges that it ſhall bring
forth vnto thee,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. and 9.</note> Take good heede that thou ſay
not, that they ſtrength and righteouſnes hath
gotten all this: but acknowledge that God, by
his onely goodnes and loue which he beareth
vnto thee, hath ſhewed theſe great benefites and
fauours to thee, without hauing any reſpect of
thee, who waſt a rebellious and idolatrous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor to thy workes, which were altogether
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7081:14"/>
vitious and faultie: euen ſo if God hath once
brought vs into his Church, let vs beware that
we ſaye not that we haue merited or gotten the
graces that be there communicated vnto vs
by our owne induſtrie: but let vs continually
confeſſe our pouertie and vnworthynes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
with the Apoſtle, that in that we
are vertuous, we are ſo, by the meane of his
onely goodnes: and then without all compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we ſhalbe richer &amp; happyer, then we ſhould
be, if we woulde be ſo, by our owne meane and
by our own ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: much more I ſay by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
of our good God, who is much richer
and more aboundaunt to geue vnto vs, then
our owne ſtrength and force can purchaſe, or
heape vpon vs. And we muſt perſwade our
ſelues that God can doe vs more good in one
moment, then we knowe howe to deſire or to
compaſſe by our trauell or diligence, in tenne
milions of yeares.</p>
            <p>What cauſe then is there,<note place="margin">Similitudes ſhewinge that we haue neede to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the onely grace of God.</note> that we ſhoulde
not deſire and labour to be more righteous by
the grace of our God, then by our own vertue?
A man ſhalbe a great deale more healthful that
will be throughly gouerned by the regiment &amp;
counſell of ſome good and expert phiſitions,
then he that wil be lead altogether by his owne
appetite. A beaſt is a greate deale better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7081:14"/>
by man, then it can be by it ſelfe. A
feilde, a vine, a tree, are in much better caſe,
being tilled, cutte and pruned by labourers and
houſbandmen, then if they were lefte to them
ſelues. Bodies alſo being alone, and without
any life, are blockes, but hauing the ſoule and
life in them, they are applyed and vſed to an
infinite nomber of goodly and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t actions:
Whereby a man maye eaſely perceaue, that
the inferiour natures, to the ende they may be
well gouerned and ruled, haue neede of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
&amp; guiding of the ſuperiour. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
commeth it then, that in the matter of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,
we thinke that our reaſon and will
haue more might, then the grace of our God?</p>
            <p>There are certaine glorious beaſtes, which
bragge that they haue gotten that which they
knowe, by their owne onely diligence, and
without the helpe of any other maiſter and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:
and that they are no further bounde, for
the good they know, then to their owne labour
and trauell. And alſo there be ſome others yet
more prowde and arrogant, who thinke them
ſelues with power ſufficiently enabled, to get
all vertues by their owne naturall faculties:
as Pelagius and all his ſecte,<note place="margin">Pelagius &amp; his ſect.</note> who canne not
better ſhew their arrogancie and ignoraunce,
then in thus pleaſing them ſelues, in them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7081:15"/>
ſelues, and hauing in ſuch eſtimation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
the naturall force and power, which
they falſly attribute to them ſelues. The which
is an euident ſigne, that they neuer knewe
them ſelues nor the ſtrength of their owne
ſhoulders, in vaunting ſo of the weakenes and
pouertie that is in them.</p>
            <p>But for our partes, if we deſier to be cladde
with a righteouſnes, which is able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the face of God, and to appeare with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
in his iudgement, let vs not ſeeke it in
our ſelues, but let vs ſeeke it, and finde it, in the
onely grace and mercie of our God. For (as
S. Auguſtine ſayeth) there is nothing within
vs, that can pleaſe and contente him, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that, which he hath put in vs of his owne
goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs not then follow theſe prowde ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
which delight and contente them ſelues
in nothing but in their own workes, &amp; through
a doting imagination accompting and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them goodly and perfect, euen as apes
do their younge ones: but contrarywiſe, let all
that is in vs, and all that we do, diſpleaſe vs, and
let vs be the firſt iudges to condemne our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and our workes, foraſmuch as the meane
to come to righteouſnes, is to be able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
with confidence, to the throne and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſeate of our God, and continually to ſaye
with the holy Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> I knowe that I am
carnall and ſoulde vnder ſinne: by meanes
whereof I can in no wiſe approue that which I

and can not do the good I loue &amp; deſire to doe,
certainelie, there is not in me, (that is to ſaye

            <p>O how this confeſſion ought throughly to
beate downe the pride and arrogancie of thoſe
preſumptuous ones, and ſtop vp the mouthes
of all thoſe that wilbe iuſtified by their owne

for his good and vprighte walking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
If then ſuch a perſon did in ſuch ſorte and ſo

            <p>Iſaye,<note place="margin">An other example of the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Iſaie, the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeruaunt of God.</note> whoſe mouth and tongue was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

as a good watchman vpon the wall to diſcouer
the comming of the enemies,<note place="margin">Iſaie 6. 6.</note> to the ende that

vs as the winde: there is none that calleth vpon

holde vpon thee: For thou haſt hidde thy face
from vs, and haſt conſumed vs becauſe of our
iniquities. Ought not this confeſſion to make
all the glorie and righteouſnes of theſe proude
hypochrites, to bluſh for ſhame? Certainely
the perfection which thoſe imagine, deſerueth
not to be compared to the imperfection of thoſe
excellent ſeruauntes of God, nor their phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
riches and abondaunce to their pouerty.
For aſmuch as the baſeſt golde,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude againſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of hypochrites</note> though it be
rayed with ſome dirte, is alwayes more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,

finde. Euen ſo the righteouſnes of a Chriſtian
man, though it be defiled through many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and imperfections, yet notwithſtanding
is more to be eſteemed then all the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of hypocrites and infidelles.</p>
            <p>There is nothing better,<note place="margin">The fruite of Chriſtian humilitie.</note> then for a man to
humble himſelfe before God. Humilitie was
the cauſe that the Caanityſh who was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a dogge, became a faithfull woman, and
that her faith was preferred, before the faith of
all the people of God. Becauſe there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meane, to lifte vs vp, then to humble our
ſelues: to be wiſe, then to repute our ſelues
fooles: to be ſtrong, then to feele our one debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and weakenes. And this S. Auguſtin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
ſayeth, that all our ſtrength is in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7081:17"/>
and that there is nothing more weake
and fraile then pryde and preſumption.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the prowde and of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as all prowd perſons ſtaye them ſelues,
vpon their owne ſtrength, that is, ſtaye vpon a
reede and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ice of one nights freſing: and
are like vnto ſmoke that mounteth vp on high,
and ſo in going vp is ſcattered and commeth to
nothing. But the humble man is as a rocke or
a ſquare body, which is alwayes ſteyed on
which ſide ſoeuer it be turned, and there is no
man (as ſayeth that ſame good father) ſo harde
to be healed, as he that thinketh him ſelfe to be
hoale: foraſmuch as he alwayes refuſeth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the phiſition, and will take no remedies,
nor keepe any good dyet or gouernment of him
ſelfe, which ſhoulde be meete and healthfull for
him. Euen ſo likewiſe there is no man farther
of from the righteouſnes of God, then he that
hath ſome good opinion of him ſelfe. For ſuch
commonly are obſtinate, and can not without
great difficultie, be brought from the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which they haue conceaued of their owne
righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>There is then no greater preſumption nor
more daungerous in the worlde,<note place="margin">Preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> then this. For
who ſoeuer preſumeth ſo of his owne ſtength &amp;
vertue, &amp; that he can of him ſelfe become wiſe,
he maketh himſelfe equal with God. For there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7081:17"/>
is none but God, which is of him ſelfe, and by
nature wiſe, righteous, bleſſed and perfecte.
Men are not otherwiſe wiſe, then by learning
and inſtruction: nor righteous, but by grace:
nor happie, but by the fruition and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſoueraigne good: If then a man wil
depende vpon him ſelfe, and eſtabliſh in him
ſelfe the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of felicitie and happynes,
preſuming that through the light &amp; quickenes
of his owne ſpirite, he can obtaine wiſedome,
and by the power of his owne will, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and by the contentation and delight which
he hath of his owne vertues and actions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
felicitie: certainly this man eſteemeth him
ſelfe to be like vnto God. But thoſe perſones
that haue ſuch an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and preſume ſo much
of them ſelues, they are founde in the ende to
come to ſhorte of their accompt: becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

who when they acknowledged not the
honour which God had beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but

heauen and to make himſelfe equall with God:
but contrary to his expectation, to beate downe
and breake the idle thoughts and diſcourſes of

that builded the tower of Babell) God hauing
attonce diſcharged him of his aucthoritie, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie
and mighte, together with the loue,
obedience, feare, and fidelitie of his ſubiectes,
freinds and ſeruaunts, in the end hauing made
him like to wilde beaſtes, with whom he liued,
and did eate, and drinke, as though they had
bene his familiers and compagnions: he was

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
therof for an earthly man to ſeeke to exalte
himſelfe, and to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to be haile fellow
with God:<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 5.</note> foraſmuch as he is geleous of his
glorie, and can not at any hande abyde that his
glorie ſhoulde be abaſed or diminiſhed, without
being kindled &amp; prouoked to reuenge him ſelfe
vpon all thoſe whom he findeth guiltie of any
ſuch audacitie and raſhenes. He woulde ſhew
vs that we are bounde vnto God for all the
good thinges we haue, and that we owe vnto
him therin faith and homage, and principally
for thoſe ſpirituall giftes of our goodnes and
felicitie: ſo as he wilbe accompted and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be the chiefe cauſe and thauthour of
that we are, afterwardes for this that we are

good, and to conclude for that we are bleſſed:
and when ſo euer we will attribute any of theſe
three thinges vnto our ſelues, or elſe referre

            <p>Alexander the Great hearing the rehearſall

was greiued, for that his father hauinge ſo

brideled his enemies on euery ſide, already he
tooke from him all hope of doinge any honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or glorious thing: As he had borne himſelfe
in hande he woulde doe, it ſo fauling out that
matter and occaſion to employe himſelfe, and
his power failed him not. For this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of all valliant and noble Princes, to be
agreiued when they looſe oportunitie to make
themſelues eſteemed and to win honour and
renowen by their proweſſe, and that they are
conſtrained to reſt them ſelues and be idle at
home in their houſe, as cowardes miching and
daſtardes. In ſo much, as there is nothing that
they are more gredie of, then the glorie and
immortalitie of their names. Is it then any
meruaill if God who is altogether perfect, and
in whome a man can not reprehend any thing,
or deſire any thing, ſhoulde in ſuch ſort loue his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7081:19"/>
glory? ſeeing that ſinnefull men are ſo deſirous
of theirs, if once they thinke to haue any thing
in them that is commendable. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vs, we maye not ſuffer our ſelues to be
vainquiſhed or ouermaiſtred of any ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which (as S. Auguſtine ſayeth) is the
worſt guide, and moſt dangerous counſailour,
that we can chooſe, to rule and gouerne our
actions by. And it is impoſſible but that we
ſhoulde obaye this paſſion, when we are once
ſubmitted vnto it, and become the ſclaues
thereof.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that we may go ſafely, we muſt
be mainteined in a ſimple humilitie, not lifting

our appetites,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruit of humility.</note> that we be like to litle children

fall as they which go vpon the ridge of houſes,
or vppon the toppe of ſome highe mountaine:
Euen ſo they that wilbe modeſt and haue no
opinion of them ſelues, they goe a great deale
more ſafely and ſurely, then they which haue a
bigge hearte, and loftie lookes. For the waye
that leadeth to life is ſtraight. And ſo is the
gate whereby a man muſt enter there. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we will paſſe thereat, we muſt not be ſo
bigge and puffed vppe with an opinion of our

ſelues: but we muſt be leane and ſpare, and we
muſt not eſteeme more of our ſelues then we

            <p>Philo the Iewe writeth that the cauſe why
leauen was forbidden the Iewes,<note place="margin">An allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the leauen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to the Iewes.</note> at the feaſt of
the Paſſeouer was, to giue them to vnderſtand

ſelues from the daunger of pryde and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
into which they doe eaſely ſlide and fall,
which haue any opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them ſelues, puffing
vp themſelues, therby as the dough is with the
leauen. Wherefore it is very requiſite that we
take good heede, in all our workes, to followe
that counſel which our Sauiour Chriſt giueth
touching our almes: to witte, that our left hand
know not what our right hand doeth. He would
teach thereby, that we ought to be ſo vertuous,
that our vertue be knowen to all the worlde, to
the ende to edifie them which ſhall ſee it and
knowe it: but of our ſelues it muſt not be
knowen, for feare that we knowing it, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
ſome preſumption in vs, which might
corrupte that foreſaide vertue: like as the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſowreth the dough wherein it is mingled.
But this ambition, as it is maſked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
ſo it knoweth very well howe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
and to flatter our appetites: ſo as we
can hardly take heede to our ſelues, yea though
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7081:20"/>
we ſtudie the beſt we can, to be humble: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it ſtealeth vnawares vppon vs, and
ſhrowdeth it ſelfe ſecretely within our hearte,
within which oftentimes it is founde or euer
we wiſte that it was entred. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why S. Auguſtine ſayeth, that all other
ſinnes are to be feared and fled indifferently of
all perſons: but the moſt perfect, and the beſt
exerciſed and experienced in vertue ought
principally to take heede of this rocke.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude againſt ambition.</note> For,
as wormes engender ſoner in a ſofte and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

We in like maner conſidering both our ſelues,

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7081:27"/>
quite contrary we are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholly turned away,
and reſiſt againſt it with all our power. Which
thing may plainely appeare by the example of
S. Paule, who was called and ledde by Ieſus
Chriſt, as it were by ſtrong hande to his ſheep
folde, euen then, when he was going to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,<note place="margin">Actes 9. 5.</note>
being carried with a deadely hatred,
and enflamed with furie to perſecute and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to roote out (if he coulde) the memorie of
his name. There is nothinge more certaine,
then that S. Auguſtine ſayth that all they that
labour and ſweate vnder the heauie burden of
this fleſh,<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> and complaine of this miſerable life,
they haue but one onely conſolation and hope,
that is to ſaye, that Ieſus Chriſt is their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
&amp; their righteouſnes. By reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made his entraunce into the middeſt
of Ieruſalem, all that wente before and behind
him cryed out with one voice, Hoſanna, &amp;c. that
is to ſaye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saue vs O ſonne of Dauid our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.
To the end to ſhew that there was neuer
good man neither before nor after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
which did hope to be ſaued by any other
meanes, then onely through his righteouſnes
and obedience.<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> And therefore S. Auguſtine
ſayeth, that all the Sainctes, ſince Abell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Iohn Baptiſte, and after the Apoſtles, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ende of the worlde ought not to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7081:27"/>
but in him, and not in them ſelues. In ſo
much that the firſt haue ſayde,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 3.</note> My ſoule ſhall
reioyce in the Lorde: and thoſe that came after
haue ſayed in like manner:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 10.</note> By grace I am that
I am: and all in generall ſaye: That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
will glorie he muſt glorie in God.</p>
            <p>And in verie truth this is he that hath borne
the wooll and the flece,<note place="margin">The perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ieſus Chriſt.</note> of which was ſponne
this cloth, wherewith we muſt be clad, that we
may be ſhrowded againſt heats, cold, and other
iniuries of heauen. All you (ſayeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
which are baptiſed in Chriſt, haue put on
Chriſt.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> This is that kinge, who for the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Queene his ſpouſe hath made for
her ritch and ſumptuous robes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 14</note> as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
ſayeth:<note place="margin">Ezec. 16. 9.</note> Which thinge Ezechiell ſheweth
alſo more clearly: I haue waſhed thee with
water, yea I haue waſhed away thy bloud from
thee, in which thou waſt altogether polluted:
I haue anoynted thee with oyle, and clothed
thee alſo with broydred worke, and haue ſette a
crowne of Golde vpon thy heade: and I haue
decked thee with golde and ſiluer, that thou
mighteſt be very bewtifull. All that ſame long
Alegorie, which he vſeth there in the 16. of his
propheſie, is to no other ende, but to extoll the
righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt, with which the
Church is apparailed and adorned: with thoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7081:28"/>
other precious giftes, graces and bleſſinges,
wherewith ſhe is altogether couered and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
And as there is nothing, more vncleane
then ſhe, when ſhe is naked: ſo is there nothing
more bewtifull then ſhe, when ſhe is decked in
the liuerie and collour of her huſband. For then
hath ſhe a ſpeciall grace, that makes her verie
amiable, delightfull, and in paſſing good liking
to God him ſelfe: Moreouer, being ſo clothed
in this robe of innocencie, all that was foule in
her, and which diſfigured her, is in ſuch ſorte
couered and defaced, that there appeareth no
more vncleanes in any part of her, becauſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt (as S. Auguſtine ſayeth) is as a
ſpounge which wipeth vs &amp; cleanſeth vs from
all our filthynes, which he taketh in exchaunge
for the bewtie, righteouſneſſe, and perfection,
which he communicateth vnto vs: Wherin we
ought to acknowledge and to adore this great
and incomparable loue which he beareth vs,
and which he hath truely and in effect ſhewed
vnto vs, heaping vpon vs at the daye of our
mariage ſo great and precious ioyes: although
he receaue nothing of vs in dowrie, but olde
baggage altogether couered with thicke and
filthie dirte: to witte, euen our imperfections
and iniquities.</p>
            <p>We receaue then, in doing this thinge two
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7081:28"/>
great commodities of his righteouſnes,<note place="margin">Chriſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs from death, and giueth vs eternall life.</note> which
ſerue vs for two purpoſes: to witte firſt to draw
vs out from the mier and claye wherein we
were buried: to decke vs with goodly robes
wherewith we are clad to make vs bewtifull:
that is to ſaye, to deliuer vs from the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and curſe, wherinto we were fallen: and
then on the other ſide to bleſſe vs and to bring
vs into fauour with God his father, to drawe
vs backe from pouertie, and to enrich vs: to
raiſe vs vp from death, and to giue vs life: to
drawe vs from hell, and to make vs mounte vp
into heauen. Euen as Ieſus Chriſt on the one
part hath deliuered vs from feare, terrour and
torment of conſcience, ſparring and ſhutting
vp hell gates: ſo on the other he hath ſet vs in
a certaine and vndoubted hope of euerlaſting
life, and of a bleſſed reſte, opening his paradiſe
vnto vs.<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 18.</note> This is that, which is ſayde of him in
the ſcripture: that he keepeth the keyes of death
and of life: the one, to make faſt and ſhut vp the
gate, which was alwayes open to ſwallow vs
vp and deuour vs: and the other, to open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs the kingdome of heauen, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
locked and ſhutte againſt vs. By meane
whereof at his death the vaile that let the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce
into the Sanctuary was broken and
clefte into two partes:<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 51.</note> to the ende that that way
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7081:29"/>
might be made open for vs, and that euery one
might haue a meane and libertie to come vnto
God, and to preſente them ſelues before him
with confidence. This is the cauſe that Paule
writing to the Hebrewes ſayed:<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> that by his fleſh
he hath prepared a waye for vs to heauen, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto life. Foraſmuch as he hath in that
fleſh rendred vnto God for vs perfect obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
and by his death hath ſatiſfied his righteouſnes
for our ſinnes, obtayni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g for vs by this meanes,
the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and through this
remiſſion righteouſnes, and by righteouſnes
the grace and fauour of God, and by Grace,
life: in ſuch ſort as we maye nowe preſente our
ſelues to him in all aſſuraunce:<note place="margin">Iſay 33. 14.</note> who before was
as a conſuming fire, to conſume vs and bring
vs to nothing &amp;c: but now by the meanes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt is a ſhadowe to releiue and refreſhe
vs againe.<note place="margin">By Ieſus Chriſt alone we haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe vnto God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the reaſon for which Ieſus Chriſt
was figured by the ladder which Iacob ſawe
when he ſleept, wherevpon the glorie of God
reſted it ſelfe.<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 12.</note> Foraſmuch as in the humanitie
of Chriſt dwelled the fulneſſe of the Diuinitie
bodely,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 9.</note> becauſe by it God deſcendeth downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs: Euen as Ieſus Chriſt hauing taken our
humanitie,<note place="margin">Iſai 7. 8.</note> was called Emmanuel, which is
aſmuch to ſaye as God is with vs, ſo alſo we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7081:29"/>
through him mounte vp as it were by degrees
to heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 23.</note> where our conuerſation is,<note place="margin">Philip. 3. 10.</note> &amp; wherof
at this day we are Citizens &amp; of the houſeholde
of God.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 19.</note> Being then very God and very man
of two diuerſe natures, the one diuine and the
other humaine, which are conioyned and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together inſeparablie, without any confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or diuiſion: in that he is God, we muſt goe
vnto him to be in ſaftie, and to liue happely: and
on the other ſide in that he is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is the way
by which we muſt march on to attaine to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life.<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we muſt go to Ieſus Chriſt
that is God, by Ieſus Chriſt that is man, by
the worde that is made fleſh, to the word which
was in the beginning with God, and by the
breade which men eate vnto the breade which
Angells eate.</p>
            <p>And there is no neede that we ſeeke for any
other but him,<note place="margin">All our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in Chriſt alone</note> whether it be to reſte our ſelues
in, or to leade and directe vs thither. For being
God, he is the ſoueraigne God, and the ende
whereunto all our appetites and deſires ought
to be directed. And when we are come thither,
there is the place where we muſt reſt and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
repoſe our ſelues: foraſmuch as he is
perfect and repleniſhed with all vertue &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
which he communicateth vnto vs, by
means of that communion and fellowſhip that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7081:30"/>
we haue with him. To conclude then, he is the
waye that muſt leade vs to our felicitie, and the
only meane to make vs attaine thither. When
we are waſhed with his bloude, this is it that
preſerueth vs from that deſtroyer, this is the
cloude that ſhrowdeth vs from being burned
&amp; conſumed with the extreme heat of the wrath
of God, and the libertie whereinto we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from the furie of the enemy that purſueth
ſo harde after vs. To be ſhorte, this is the gate
of ſaluation and the hauen where we muſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borre
and ſaue our ſelues in the time of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſte.</p>
            <p>This is the cloke vnder which we maye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the bleſſing of God,<note place="margin">VVe obtain throughe Chriſt the bleſsing of God.</note> as Iacob obtayned
that of his father Iſaake, being diſguiſed with
the apparell of his elder brother Eſau. And as
the high Prieſt neuer appeared before the face
of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 19.</note> without his holy embroidred garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
his Ephod,<note place="margin">Exod. 28. 2.</note> his robe, and his other prieſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
without which he coulde not fynde any
fauour when he appeared in his preſence: Euen
ſo (to follow the truth of this figure) we ought
neuer to preſente our ſelues before God (if
we will be accepted and receaued of him,) but
we muſt be clothed and decked with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
and innocencie of his ſonne: wherwith
if we be once couered, we neede not feare that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7081:30"/>
we ſhall be reiected and deſpiſed of him, or that
there is any enemy whoſoeuer he be, that hath
any power to hurte vs. For ſuch armour can
defende vs euen from the wrath of God it ſelfe,
againſt which no other thing can reſiſte.</p>
            <p>It is written that Alexander hauing concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a great hatred againſt the cittie of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,<note place="margin">Ioſeph lib. 11. de anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui. Iudaic. cap. 8.</note>
was fully reſolued vtterly to deſtroye it,
becauſe that laying ſeidge to the cittie of Tyr
the inhabitauntes of Ieruſalem had refuſed to
helpe him with victuals and other munition
which he had demaunded of them. Nowe after
that he had taken Tyr, he marched forth with
all his armie againſt Ieruſalem, with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
vtterly to deſtroy it. The which thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the highe Prieſt named Iaddus vnderſtood, he
apparailed him ſelfe with the holy garmentes
of the highe Prieſt, and ſo preſented him ſelfe
before Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, who vpon the ſuddaine, when
he ſawe him in this habite, alighted from
his horſe, and bowed his knees before Iaddus,
and reuerenced him, and ſhewed him great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and great loue to the countrey, and gaue
great giftes to the temple. Nowe if an enemy
ſo furious and terrible were ſo ſuddainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed,
at the onely ſight of this highe Prieſt
ſo apparailed (who was but a figure of Ieſus
Chriſt:) what ſhall it be when Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7081:31"/>
ſhal appeare in his glorie and all his members
with him, clad and couered with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and ſhewing them ſelues to all the worlde,
in ſuch and ſo magnificall and glorious appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raill?
Shall not the deuills and hell bowe their
knees then for feare when they ſhall ſee him in
his maieſtie and in ſuch excellent glorie?</p>
            <p>Let vs conclude then that beinge garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and couered with the righteouſnes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, we can haue no lacke of ſtrength
and might to vanquiſh and ouercome our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
nor of any other thing that may make vs
perfectly happy what ſoeuer.<note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note> As S. Ambroſe
writeth verie elegantly, in his ſeconde booke
of Virginitie, that Ieſus Chriſt is vnto vs, all
in all things: If we be ſicke, he is our phiſition:
If we haue an Ague, and that we are altered,
he is our fountaine: If we be laden with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he is our righteouſnes: If we be weake and
weryed, he is our ſtrength: If we feare death,
he is our life: If we deſire to mounte vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
he is our ladder: If we haue byne darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
he is our light: If we haue houngred, he
is our breade and nouriſhment. Wherupon we
may perceaue and knowe the great riches and
commodities that Ieſus Chriſt bringeth vnto
all them that poſſeſſe him.</p>
            <p>Now hauing ſhewed that there is no other

righteouſnes,<note place="margin">The third point ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in whom the iuſtice of God is, and howe a man maye obtaine it.</note> but the righteouſnes of Chriſt,

vs to appeare and aunſwere there: it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
now that we declare vpon what matter it
worketh and where it reſteth &amp; dwelleth: how
it maye be obtayned: and in what ſort a man
maye aſſure him ſelfe of it: finally, hauinge
obteyned it, what fruits it bringeth forth in vs.</p>
            <p>Firſt the righteouſnes of Chriſt hath two
principall partes,<note place="margin">The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt hath two partes.</note> to witte Iuſtification, and
Sanctification, that is to ſaye: when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
vnto vs, although that before we
were the wickedeſt in the worlde, and guiltie of
death before God, and moreouer, that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was altogether corrupted and teynted in
euery parte of it:<note place="margin">How we are iuſtified.</note> notwithſtanding all this, we
are holden and reputed for righteous before
God, and are allowed and receaued of him for
his children and heires, when we are proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of this righteouſnes, and when we are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with it, he giueth vs his holy ſpirite, to
leade vs and conducte vs (as a ſchoolmaiſter
doth his children) and for to ſanctifie, inſtructe
and ſtrengthen vs in all his wayes. And that
this is true. S. Paule writeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 22.</note> not onely that
it was ſayde of Abraham that his faith was
counted to him for righteouſnes: but alſo that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7081:32"/>
we ſhalbe accompted righteous before God,
as he was, if we beleue in Ieſus Chriſt: Alſo,
God was in Chriſt and reconciled the worlde
to himſelfe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 19.</note> not imputinge their ſinnes vnto
them. And ioyning both theſe partes together
in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, he ſayed
to them ſpeakinge of their life, that they had
bene altogether led in wickednes, and were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
in all kinde of miſcheefe: but that they
were now waſhed,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 11.</note> iuſtified and ſanctified in the
name of Ieſus Chriſt, and through the ſpirite
of God.</p>
            <p>Now if we will know by what meane this
is done,<note place="margin">VVe are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſanctified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes &amp; holynes of Chriſt.</note> we muſt note, that being vnited by
faith in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and graffed in
him, (as members in their body,) that he is
then become our heade, and we are ioyned to
him as the houſbande to his wife. By meanes
whereof he chargeth him ſelfe with all our
debtes,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> and appointeth him ſelfe to be the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
and pledge for vs, to the ende he maye
paye all for vs and throughly acquite vs of all,
that we are indebted and bounde for, offring
him ſelfe to ſatiſfie the righteouſnes of God, by
his owne death, to the which death we were
bounde by reaſon of our ſinnes:<note place="margin">Galat. 3. 13</note> and to deliuer
vs by his Croſſe, from the curſſe, to which we
were likewiſe ſubiect, for hauing diſobeyed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7081:32"/>
the will of God, and broken his lawe, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

out our diſobedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> by his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which
being ſo perfect &amp; accompliſhed in all pointes,
he hath ſupplied and made amendes for all our
faultes and imperfections, and for the dutie
wherewith we were bounde to God with all
our might, being his creatures, children and
ſeruaunts. The death then which Ieſus Chriſt
hath ſuffred, the ſacrifice which he hath offred,
the curſſe which he hath borne, &amp; the obedience
that he hath rendred: all this was done in our
name, and for our diſcharge, and is receaued
before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, for acquitall in ful
payment and diſcharge of all our debtes, in
ſuch ſort that no more can be demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded againe
of vs, he hauing through his innocencie fully
ſatiſfied that promiſe which he had made for vs.
Beholde the firſt reaſon, why the righteouſnes
of Ieſus Chriſt is imputed vnto vs and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God in his iudgement.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note> that being knitte and
vnited together by mariage,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 30.</note> both we and he are
but one body and one fleſh: and there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
communion between vs. And as he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipateth
with our afflictions, miſeries, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and infirmities, ſo when we are perſecuted
by tyrans, he complaineth with vs and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7081:33"/>
our aduerſities and ſorrowes, likewiſe,
when we are houngry, ſicke, diſeaſed, in priſon,
&amp;c. he beareth and endureth all our calamities
with vs. We alſo on the contrary part are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of all his benefites, graces and giftes
which his father hath beſtowed vpon him: and
in generall, of all that he hath done and ſuffred
for our ſaluation and redemption: we are anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as he was, with the oyle of his holy ſpirite:
we are deade and buried with him, and we are
raiſed vp and caried into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him where
we are ſette at the right hande of God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4.</note>
as he is.<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 1.</note> We are inheritours together
with him,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 22.</note> and we haue part in his glorie, in his
reſt &amp; in all his felicity,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> by meane of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
obedience &amp; innocencie, of all which
through his grace we are made partakers. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
of his death, ſacrifice and ſatiſfaction. And
to conclude,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> as marchantes which are of one
companie &amp; become parteners, are partakers
alike of all the profittes and damages which
growe of their marchandiſe: euen ſo Ieſus
Chriſt, by reaſon of that ſocietie we haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with him, giueth vs a parte, and we
likewiſe giue him, of all that we haue and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe.
The difference that is in this, is, that the
gaines &amp; loſſes, that come of the traffique that
is exerciſed amongeſt men is equall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7081:33"/>
amongeſt them all, but here we gather vp
all the fruites that ariſe of the righteouſnes of
Ieſus Chriſt: he on the contrary parte taketh
vpon him, and chargeth himſelfe with all the
damages and loſſes that came of our diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon,<note place="margin">3. Reaſon.</note> for which the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Chriſt is imputed vnto vs,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 2.</note> is, that being
knitte to him, as the members of a bodie are to
their heade (the which, by meanes of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
receaue thence one influence which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them life, and diſtributeth to each their
motions &amp; ſenſes according as is fitte for their
nature, and as is requiſite for their actions) we
receaue from him as S. Paule ſayeth, our life,
our nouriſhment, our grouth, our force and
ſtrength: for the enabling and diſpoſing of vs
to doe thoſe good workes that belong vnto our
vocation. And by reaſon of this coniunction
there is ſuch an vnion betwixt him and vs, that
as he communicateth with vs in our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
ſo we likewiſe on the other ſide communicate
with him, in his riches: we are righteous by
his righteouſnes, we are acquited by his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
we are quickened to life by his death,
and obaye God through his obedience.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> And
euen as in a naturall body, the power that the
eye hath to ſee, ſerueth more to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of the other
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7081:34"/>
members then for it ſelfe becauſe that ſeeing
and marking them all it is watchfull rightly to
guide them and to direct euery one of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
not being able in the meane time to ſee
them ſelues, nor to ſerue it ſelfe: euen ſo the
righteouſnes, innocencie &amp; obedience of Chriſt
Ieſus, ſtande vs in more ſted then him, ſeeing
that notwithſtanding he had all theſe thinges,
and it was in his nature, life, and whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
abſolut and perfect, yet for all this,
he was condemned and crucified. We on the
contrary part albeit his righteouſnes, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
and obedience be onely imputed vnto
vs, yet for all that, by meanes of this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we are abſolued, iuſtified and diſcharged
of all our ſinnes, and of all accuſations that all
our enemies can bring againſt vs.</p>
            <p>The other part of the righteouſnes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt conſiſteth in the ſanctification not
only of vs but alſo of our works.<note place="margin">The 2. part of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt.</note> For although
that there is not (as Paule ſayth) any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
between righteouſnes and vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 14.</note>
between light and darkenes, between the
temple of God and Idolls: yet for all this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Ieſus Chriſt will ioyne vs with him ſelfe, and
will chooſe vs and conſecrate vs, to the ende to
dwell in vs, as in his temple:<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> he ſanctifieth vs
firſt by his ſpirit &amp; prepareth the houſe where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7081:34"/>
he will dwell. And becauſe it is ouer ſtreight to
entertaine ſo great a lorde, he enlargeth it: and
whereas it is olde and ruinous, he repayreth it
and buildeth it newe againe: whereas it is ſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and full of filthe, he ſweepeth and clenſeth
it. And to be briefe, where as it is naked and
vnfurniſhed, he furniſheth and decketh it. And
euen as, when he woulde be borne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Marie, and before he woulde be lodged in
her wombe, he ſent his ſeruauntes before him,
that is to ſaye, his ſpirite, to the ende to take it
vp for him and to ſette his marke there: ſo alſo
when he wilbe conceaued in our hartes, and be
borne of vs, he prepareth and regenerateth vs
before, ſanctifying the place where he will
make his abode.</p>
            <p>Now this ſanctification conſiſteth in fower
pointes.<note place="margin">The ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the faithful conſiſteth in 4. points.</note> The firſt is, that we feele and confeſſe
our ſinnes, and that we accuſe, condemne, and

accurſſed in all pointes.<note place="margin">1. Hatred &amp; deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euil.</note> The ſecond is, that we
haue a ſetled zeale and feruent affection to the

out,<note place="margin">2. A loue and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor to good.</note> with all diligence, all the meanes &amp; wayes

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> all the thinges that maye turne
vs awaye from it. The third is, that we fight
couragiouſly againſt all the deſiers and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7081:35"/>
of our fleſh, and that we be ſtrong and
reſolued againſt all the other tentations of the
deuill and the worlde, whether it be that we are
ſweetly enticed or flattered thereunto, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
drawen and enforced. And that we be
not colde and white lyuered in theſe combats,
but hardy, vigilant, and attentiue to eſpie and
to take all occaſions,<note place="margin">4. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall inuocation for Gods fauour.</note> whereby we maye reſiſte,
and vanquiſh all our enemies. The fourth is,
that as we continually ſinne, ſo we alſo as often
diligently praye vnto God, that it will pleaſe
him of his great mercy to pardon our offences.
And as the people of Iſraell, going through
the deſerts, had to ſight oftentimes againſt the
ſerpents, and when they were ſtonge and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by them, for to be preſerued from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
and from death, they lifted vp their eyes
toward the braſen ſerpente that Moiſes had ſet
vp amiddeſt their tentes, by ſight whereof they
were healed: we in like maner fighting againſt
our concupiſcences, if it come to paſſe at any
time that they giue vs any blowe, to the ende
that this ſtripe may not be deadely vnto vs, we
muſt lifte vp our eyes towardes Ieſus Chriſt
hanging vpon the Croſſe, and beſeech him that
he woulde forgiue vs all our treſpaſſes.<note place="margin">VVhat it is, to applie a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſelfe to good workes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now when it is ſayd that to ſhewe our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
by the effecte we muſt applie our
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7081:35"/>
ſelues to good workes, it maye not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that it is enough to exerciſe our ſelues in
one or in two, leauing the reſt behinde: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doe, who doe not take nor vſe the worde of
God, but in that only where it is agreable and
maie be referred (they thinke) to their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite:
but it is needfull to embrace it wholie, and
not to thinke that we can doe our dutie in any
ſorte whatſoeuer, vnleſſe we enforce our ſelues
to keepe all the commaundementes of God,
without omitting the leaſt point or title therof.
Euen like as to be healthie in our bodyes,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> it is
not enough, not to haue the plague or a pleure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
but generally to be free from all diſeaſes:
euen ſo to be holy in our ſoules, we muſt be
cleane from all ſpottes and defylinges: and we
muſt take the whole lawe of God, as an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
rule of all our thoughts, affections, wordes
and deedes, to the ende to keepe it from point
to point, and not to omitte any thing which is
there commaunded vs.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> And what would it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
in a cittie, diligently to watch at one gate
and to keep it ſhutte againſt the enemye, if in
meane while all the reſte ſtood wide open to
him? euen ſo likewiſe it is to no purpoſe to keep
our ſelues from one vice, vnleſſe we make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
and conſcience to abondon our ſelues
from all others: like as amongeſt archers (as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7081:36"/>
ſayeth Ariſtotle) there is but one onely marke
wherto they muſt direct their arrowes to ſhoot
well, and yet many meanes to miſſe and ſhoote
ſhort: ſo is there but one onelie holynes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
we muſt aſpire, which is a ſetled deſier,
fully reſolued wholly to obaye God. But there
are many kinds of vices and meanes to diſobey
him, and to withſtand his will. We conclude
then, that to be applied to good workes, it muſt
not be done to halues, but perfectly &amp; without
exception to take care and indeuour to keep all
that God commaundeth.</p>
            <p>But here a queſtion muſt be reſolued,<note place="margin">Of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of workes.</note> and
that is: that if to doe our dutie, and to ſatiſfie
the will of God, we muſt be perfect in euery
kinde of vertue. And we can not otherwiſe be
Sainctes and Chriſtians, vnleſſe we haue in
perfection all the points of holynes. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
and ſchoolemen,<note place="margin">The opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers &amp; ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> they ſay that this is
neceſſarie, and that a man can not be ſayd to
be vertuous vnleſſe he haue attained to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and perfection of all vertues: But the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
&amp; the auncient fathers they ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.<note place="margin">Sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and auncient doctours.</note>
For S. Paule ſayeth, that the minde is
accepted according to that it hath: that is to
ſaye,<note place="margin">3. Cor. 8. 12.</note> that we are accepted of God when we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye
that portion and meaſure of power and
ſtrength which he hath giuen vnto vs to the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7081:36"/>
ende to do well, and he is contented with that,
although we lagge ſomewhat behinde, and in a
great ſorte of thinges come verie ſhorte of that
ende and perfection, which is propounded and
ſet out vnto vs in the lawe. And the ſelfeſame
Apoſtle confeſſeth, that he had nothing, but
that ſame onely will:<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> To will is preſent with
me (ſayeth he:) but I finde no meane to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that which is good. Abraham ſacrificed
his ſonne,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 16.</note> no otherwiſe then in effect, &amp; he had
nothing but the ſame will which was imputed
vnto him, as if he had accompliſhed all that
was commaunded him. So as God him ſelfe
witneſſeth of him, ſaying: Foraſmuch as thou
haſt done this thinge, and to obaye me haſt
not ſpared thine onely ſonne, I will bleſſe thee
and multiplie thy ſeede, as the ſtarres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Ieſus Chriſt ſhal ſay vnto his elect, which
ſhall be on his right hande in the daye of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34</note>
Come ye bleſſed of my father: inherite ye
the kingdom prepared for you before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion
of the worlde. Foraſmuch as when I
was houngry ye gaue me meate, &amp;c. This is
certaine that among the elect, there was ſome
who being holden in pouertie, or for lacke of
ability, or by ſome other let, did not that, which
Chriſt ſhall ſaye there they did, which thinges
themſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe not to haue done in the ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7081:37"/>
place alleaged: And yet for all this, it ſhalbe
ſayde vnto all, not becauſe all haue done thoſe
things, but becauſe they had a will to do them.
Moreouer, if in reſpect of vice, the will onely
be enough to conuince and condemne a man,
and that he is accompted an adulterer before
the iudgement of God, who hath onely looked
on his neighbours wife to luſte after her: and
that he is alſo reputed a manqueller, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his brother: euen ſo likewiſe in reſpect of
good workes we muſt not doubte but the good
wil, and deſire we haue to performe them is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and approued of God though alwayes
the effectes follow not ſo ſoone and ſo excellent
as we deſire.</p>
            <p>As touching the auncient fathers, they ſaye
the ſelfe ſame thinge,<note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note> S. Ambroſe vppon S.
Luke, affirmeth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
man conſiſteth more in the will, then in
the worke, and that it ought rather be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the affection then by the effect. But in
the booke which he hath written <hi>De fuga mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi>
he ſayeth, it is a harde thing for one to keepe
himſelfe wholly from vanitie, and that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
altogether to depart from it, otherwiſe
then in will and deſire alone.<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> S. Auguſtine v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the firſt Epiſtle of Iohn ſayeth: that the
whole life of a Chriſtian is no other thing but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7081:37"/>
an holy deſire and good will: And in his 9.
booke of the Trinitie, he hath a ſaying ſeruing
to this purpoſe worthy to be noted: He (ſayeth
he) that knoweth righteouſnes and loueth it
perfectly, that man is righteous, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that outwardly he hath not yet ſhewed by
his workes, in any ſort, that good affection of
his harte. To conclude, looke where and how
often ſo euer God hath commended vnto vs the
ſtudie and keeping of his lawe, he doth it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in theſe tearmes: Thou ſhalt take heede
to do thoſe thinges which I commaunde thee:
To giue vs to vnderſtand that the principall
point that he requiers of vs, is, that we haue a
deſire to pleaſe him, and a ready good will to
do that, which he hath commaunded vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that grace and ſtrength that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs, which is the thing that he moſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in vs. As we ſee a father a great deale
more to contente him ſelfe with that his ſonne
doth, be it neuer ſo litle, then of all that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
can do: becauſe he eſteemeth their works
not according to their greatnes, or the paine
and time that they haue ſpente in doing them:
but according to the will and readynes which
they haue that do them.</p>
            <p>We muſt then conclude, that the holynes of
a Chriſtian man, the deutie &amp; diligence which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7081:38"/>
maketh him to employe thoſe graces that he
hath receaued of God, to profite in his feare,
and continually to better him ſelfe in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
&amp; grougth of good workes, are imperfect
in many reſpectes.<note place="margin">Ieronim.</note> And as S. Ierom ſayeth:
the perfection of all the righteouſnes that is in
the fleſh is maymed: &amp; to be perfect it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
that we acknowledge, confeſſe, and feele
with an inward feeling, that we are imperfect.
S. Auguſtine confirmeth the ſame,<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> ſaying: that
a righteous mans vertue maye be ſayde to be
perfect with this condicion, that his perfection
conſiſteth in hauing the knowledge of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
and in making humble confeſſion
thereof before God. And how ſoeuer there be
great lacke in vs in this point, &amp; that our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes
are as vnperfect beginnings in this
worlde: yet neuertheles, we muſt not thinke
that he will reiect and denie them: For he is
not as other creditours rigourous and not to
be intreated, who will not be contented with
him that is bounde before they be payd and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
the vttermoſt farthing: but he is gentle
and gracious, and is pleaſed with vs, when we
denie not our debtes, and will not excuſe our
ſelues in this, that we are not able to paye: but
without all diſſimulation or conſtrainte, we
frankly and freely confeſſe, ſhewing him the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7081:38"/>
deſire we haue to ſatiſfie him, which yet we can
not doe (by reaſon of our pouertie) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
humblie beſech him that he will take in
good parte that litle we haue, and offring that
vnto him, which he hath giuen vs of his owne
ſpeciall grace.</p>
            <p>When we thus ſubmitte our ſelues wholly
vnto him, and praye him to vſe ſuch fauour and
gentlenes as ſhall pleaſe him towardes vs, we
likewiſe bearing and ſhewing ſuch a ſinceritie
and vprightnes towardes him in the affaires
we haue to do, there is no doubt but he will in
like manner take in good part that litle which
we preſent vnto him: and that both we and our
workes (how imperfect ſo euer they are) ſhall
be accepted and approued of him, in the fauour
of his ſonne, as if they were perfect, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in euery point.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that god reiecteth not his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</note> For a father caſteth not
away his children, becauſe they are ſicke, croke

them more tenderly, &amp; dealeth more ſoftly
with them, then with the others, reſpecting
their debility and feeblenes. We caſt not away
wine though it haue lyes or groundes, nor
golde how ſoeuer it be couered with durte. A
houſband man refuſeth not lande, though it be
ouergrowen with brambles and bryers: but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7081:39"/>
will vſe the greater diligence to ſtocke it and
to plowe it, hoping with his diligence, that it
will bring forth fruite plentifully: God like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
will not refuſe and put vs awaye, becauſe
he ſeeth manye imperfections and infirmities
in vs, naye rather that is an occaſion, that he
will take the greater pittie vpon vs:<note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 13.</note> as Dauid
ſayeth: Albeit (ſayeth S. Ambroſe) the light
be oftentimes hidden by a cloude,<note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note> which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before the ſunne, yet therfore it is not quite
put out. And the ſunne ceaſeth not to be the
ſunne, though his beames be ſtopped, and can
not pierce vnto vs: euen ſo likewiſe howſoeuer
our faith oftentimes be diſfigured, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by many errours, doubtings and diſtruſtes:
it is not therfore quite choked,<note place="margin">Two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</note> and we leaue not
to be faithfull for theſe imperfections.</p>
            <p>But before I ende this matter, it is meete,
that we yet handle two pointes:<note place="margin">1. VVhy God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte workes of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> one of which,
is the reaſon, why our holynes is acceptable
vnto God, and the ſeruice which we doe vnto
him, ſeeing both the one and the other are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect:
and ſeeing in his lawe he reiecteth all
the ſacrifices,<note place="margin">2. VVhy the faithful are not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in this worlde.</note> which had in them any imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all. The other point is concerning the
cauſe wherefore he regenerating &amp; ſanctifying
vs by his holy ſpirite, hath yet lefte ſuch an
heape of vices and imperfections in vs, and ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7081:39"/>
much corruption in our nature and life, which
notwithſtanding all the diligence and labour
we can, to correct and mortifie it, yet we can
not come any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eare, to be wholy deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and exempte from it.<note place="margin">An anſwer to the firſt queſtion.</note> Touching the firſt of
theſe two pointes, there are two reaſons, for
which our vertues and workes are approued
&amp; accepted before God, how imperfect ſo euer
they be. One is, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
and taken them vnder the cloke of his
righteouſnes, aſſone as we are vnited and knit
vnto him: ſo as no ſuch ſpotte appeareth in vs
that can offend God. And for that he is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
towardes God his father, we ſee God
no otherwiſe then in him and by him: As the
father in like manner will not ſee nor beholde
vs other where then in Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; through
his humanitie as members and partes of his
body. And this is the cauſe that maketh vs to
appeare altogether other then we are:<note place="margin">Similitudes</note> For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
like as loking aſide through any glaſſe, be
it blew or yelow or of any other coulor, all the
thinges we ſee ſeeme to vs to be of the coulor of
the glaſſe, through which we did beholde them:
So God alſo beholding and looking vpon vs in
his ſonne, we ſeeme to him to be of his coulor,
and we haue the appearaunce and brightnes of
his innocency and righteouſnes: which cauſeth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7081:40"/>
that in ſeeing and touching vs, he thinketh he
ſeeth &amp; toucheth his owne naturall Sonne. As
Iſaack ſpeaking to Iacob his yonger ſonne,
and feeling his necke and handes, thought it
had bene Eſau his eldeſt ſonne. The other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, that the grace of Gods ſpirite, being
mingled with our workes, our workes deriue &amp;
fetch from thence their greateſt dignitie, bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note>
eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; free ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, as when we mingle
water with wine in a cuppe or in a glaſſe, that
which is taken in there is called wine, though
water be mingled with it: and albeit there be
more water then wine (as it maye be) yet that
which is the more principal and moſt precious
part of all, beareth the name: euen ſo the works
which we do by the grace of God, be it that
they haue a great many ſpottes and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as they proceed from vs, yet for all that,
they holde alwayes the name and reputation of
him, who is their principall aucthour.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond point,<note place="margin">An anſwer to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d queſtion.</note> which is to
know the reaſon why God doth not wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat
and ſanctifie vs, from the firſt hower
that he calleth vs to his knowledge: ſeeing that
all his workes are perfect, and that the lawe
requireth of vs, that we ſhoulde be holy as he
is holy: that is to ſay, that we ſhoulde be wholy
and perfectly holy. We muſt marke, in verie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7081:40"/>
deede, that our regeneration and ſanctification
are workes of God which are perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
as all that he doth is: But this perfection
is ſucceſſiue or by degrees. As we ſee that it is
in many of his creatures.<note place="margin">Similitudes</note> Seede caſt into the
earth doth not by and by ſprout, encreaſe and
come to his perfection: but by ſpace and length
of time, it attaineth to his perfection and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in that ſeaſon that God hath appointed.
A tree likewiſe, is not perfect aſſoone as it is
planted. An infante is not ſtreight wayes vpon
the ſuddaine aſſoone as it is conceaued in the
wombe of his mother, become a man but with
time: euen ſo we are not all at the firſt daſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated.
But this regeneration riſeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and being once begonne, then it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
faire and ſoftly by litle and litle encreaſing
euery daye, till we come to euerlaſting life in
the heauens. And in that God delighteth ſo to
regenerate and entierly to reforme vs, to make
vs altogether newe creatures,<note place="margin">Three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate vs perfectly.</note> he doth it for
three great and weighty reaſons. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would humble vs, foraſmuch as being
naturally enclyned to preſume to much of our
ſelues, we haue great neede that this pride be
keept vnder: and that this miſcheuous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which we haue to ſuch manner of arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
ſhoulde be digged vp and rooted out of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7081:41"/>
hartes: which thinge God doeth after that he
hath adopted vs leauing vs ſubiect to many
miſeries and diſeaſes, aſwell of the body as of
the minde, to the ende that by this meane we
ſhoulde be barred from lifting vp our ſelues in
any opinion and admiration of our ſelues, and
that we ſhoulde not ſpeake more biggely and
proudly then we ought: and herein he maketh
of a poiſon, a remedy and preſeruatiue againſt
the poiſon that is in our nature: as we ſee by
experience to be done in the confectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of triacle.
For euen like as of the fleſh of the viper men
make a ſoueraigne and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remedy againſt
the bytinge of them:<note place="margin">Similitudes full of great conſolation.</note> euen ſo God maketh of
thoſe infirmities that remaine in vs after our
regeneration, and which of them ſelues are
deadly and damnable ſinnes before him, an
healthfull remedie to correct and repreſſe the
other vices &amp; diſeaſes, which are a great deale
more pernicious: as is arrogancie and vaine
confidence of our ſelues, contempt and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of God, and ſuch other like peſtilences
which would kill vs ſuddainly, if they were not
ſpedely preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Which thing our good God
doth, who knowing the daunger wherein we
are, as a good father is more carefull for our
good &amp; ſaluation then we our ſelues. By meane
whereof, he preuenteth and cutteth of the waye
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7081:41"/>
that leadeth to the daunger of death (wherein
otherwiſe we are) by theſe afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; diſeaſes,
which alwayes putteth vs in minde and ſetteth
this medicine before our eyes, driuing vs to
ſearch after him &amp; to requier aide at his hands.
He dealeth with vs, as a iudge in ſome crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
proceſſe, who will giue an enlargement,
but yet with condition, or as they ſaye with a
<hi>quouſque,</hi> that is, till the time that he calleth
it backe, and putteth him in his former eſtate
wherein he was before, if it happen that he fall
into any new fault againe. The iudges do this
to keepe them alwayes in feare and diligence,
to do their dewtie, and to ſtoppe them from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to great liberty. God likewiſe doth ſo
with vs, when he will pardon our ſinnes and ſet
vs at libertie, leauing vs notwithſtanding a
great ſorte of infirmities and imperfections,
which maye alwayes ſerue him, to charge vs,
and for matter to call vs to a reckoning, when
we would winde out of that bondage, and boaſt
our ſelues abroade of the goodlynes of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and loialtie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is,<note place="margin">The 2. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> becauſe he woulde
correct our ingratitude, which is a vice as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to vs as preſumption. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
into which we fall ſo eaſely, as into the
forgetfulnes of God and of his benefits, which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7081:42"/>
we haue receaued of him, eſpecially when we
are at eaſe and in proſperitie, which maketh vs
wanton, and bereueth vs oftentimes of our
ſenſes and vnderſtanding, which is an other of
the moſt pernicious vices that can be and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh
the heauy wrath and iudgement of God
againſt vs. And this is the cauſe, why he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs alwayes in ſuch neceſſity to the ende he
maye meete with ſuch an inconuenience and
giue vs occaſion to ſeeke after him.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe that he his.</note> Againe he
doth vs not all the good he will doe, at one

of an houſholde well aduiſed, who at the

but doth for them by litle and litle, the better
alwayes to put them in comfort and hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
aduantage at laſte, to the ende that by
this meane, they maye be holden in ſeruice, and
not departe from his houſe: euen ſo, God du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time that we are in this world, giueth
vs more hope, then he doth benefites (and yet
it is plaine that the graces that he beſtoweth
vpon vs are infinite) for feare leaſte that if he
ſhoulde make vs great and rich attonce, and
ſhoulde giue vs out of hande all the good that
he keepeth in ſtore for vs, it woulde make vs to
abandon his ſeruice, as we ſee ſometimes it

happened to the Iewes by this occaſion.<note place="margin">Iere. 22. 21.</note> As
God reprocheth them by his prophet Ieremy:

            <p>The third reaſon,<note place="margin">The third reaſon.</note> why God doth not attonce
defende &amp; fortifie vs and that throughout, when
he hath regenerated vs, is, to the end that thoſe
infirmities which yet remaine in vs after our
regeneration, ſhoulde ſerue to exerciſe vs, and
to keepe vs from ſlothfulnes and ſleeping.<note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note> For
hauing (as S. Ambroſe ſayeth) a robe or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is all to torne and vnſewed, and
which for this cauſe had neede to be amended,
we muſt occupie our ſelues in repairing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the ſame: and muſt auoyde by this
meane ſlothfulneſſe and idleneſſe. Moreouer,
being ſo exerciſed we grow more ſtronge and
able to fight againſt the fleſh and againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enemies. Which thing was aunſwered
to S. Paule (when he deſired to be deliuered
from that pricke of the fleſh that ſo continually
troubled him) that he ought to contente him
ſelfe with the grace of God which is ſufficient:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 9.</note>
the ſtrength whereof ſheweth it ſelfe more in
our infirmities then in our proſperities. Marke
then that our diſeaſes and afflictions ſtand vs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7081:43"/>
in ſted and greatly profite vs, when we ſuffer
and beare them patiently, and we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
our ſelues with the onely will of God that
ſendeth them, and likewiſe we muſt waye that
the ende of theſe imperfections, which he hath
yet left in vs after that he hath regenerate vs,
is, to keep vs in obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and to bridle vs, that
we do not ſtumble and goe aſtraye. For euen
like as to be wiſe, it behoueth vs to be fooles
(as S. Paule ſayeth) and to the ende we maye
ſee more cleerly (as Ieſus Chriſt ſayeth) to
be blinde:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 18.</note> euen ſo that we maye be perfect we
muſt be imperfect,<note place="margin">Iohn 9. 41.</note> and that we haue fowle and
dirtie feete, it is to keepe vs occupied in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
them.</p>
            <p>Hauing now handled theſe two partes of
Chriſts righteouſnes,<note place="margin">The 4. point where the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt is to be founde.</note> it followeth neceſſaryly
to be knowen, what the matter is wherevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
righteouſnes worketh, where it reſteth and is
to be founde either in him or in vs. Where as
the Sorbonicall ſophiſters ſay that we can not
be otherwiſe righteous, then by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that is in vs: we ſaye cleane contrary, to
witte, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes which we muſt haue
to eſcape the iudgement of God, is not in vs,
but in Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 21.</note> As S. Paule ſayeth, that
he was made ſinne for vs, that we ſhoulde be
made the righteouſnes of God in him. If we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7081:43"/>
will therefore rightely vnderſtande, how his
righteouſneſſe is attributed vnto vs, we muſt
know in what reſpect our ſinne is attributed
vnto him: foraſmuch as there is the like reaſon
of the one, as there is of the other. But it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
certaine that our ſinnes were neuer effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in Ieſus Chriſt: who being conceaued
by the holy Ghoſt was alwaies holy, innocent,
cleane, and without ſpotte: but our ſinnes were
onely imputed vnto him,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26.</note> to the ende that he
ſhoulde beare the puniſhment of them for vs.
In like manner, his righteouſnes is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
in vs. For to what degree ſoeuer, of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or vertue we be come vnto in this life, there
is notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding alwayes in vs a great many
of diſordred and vnruly affections: in our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
a great many of euill thoughtes:
in our mouthes a great many of euill wordes:
in our workes a great many of imperfections
and indirect dealinges: in all our life there is
ſo much corruption and filthynes, that of it ſelfe
it is abhominable and ſtincking in the ſight of
God. Wherevpon a man maye well know, that
ſuch a righteouſneſſe as that is that was in
the ſonne of God, neither dwelleth nor remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
eſſentially in vs, but onely by imputation:
to the ende that thereby we maye receaue the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7081:44"/>
rewarde.<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 3.</note> And altogether like (as S. Paule
ſayeth) that our life is hidde in him, and muſt
not be reueiled, till the time that he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in glorie: euen ſo is our righteouſnes,
the which appeareth not clearely enough, by
reaſon of our imperfections, no more then our
life doth by reaſon of our mortalitie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
till the daye that God ſhall appeare
in iudgement in the perſon of his ſonne.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon why this righteouſneſſe
is compared to a robe,<note place="margin">The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of the faithful compared to a robe.</note> according to that which
is ſayde in the Pſalme: that the prieſtes ſhould
be clothed with righteouſneſſe. For as a robe
is not borne with vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.</note> and we haue it not from
our mothers wombe as we haue our ſkinne:
&amp; it is not faſtened to our bodies as the ſkinnes
of beaſtes: euen ſo likewiſe neither is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
wherwith we are couered, as with a
longe robe, to the ende that our imperfections
maye not be perceaued. And this is a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
and mercie that God hath done and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, in that he hath not aſſigned it to
our ſelues nor put it ouer in our owne handes,
but hath prouided a ſtewarde, to whom he hath
deliuered it in truſt: foraſmuch as we are ſo
ill aduiced, and ſo ill houſbandes, that had we
once the ordring of it our ſelues, the deuill by
his ſleightes and conuayaunces woulde ſone
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7081:44"/>
beguile vs. For if our fore fathers who were
ſo wiſe &amp; indued with ſo many excellent graces,
coulde not keep ſafely that originall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for ſo ſmall a time, (wherewith they were
adorned from the beginning) and were notable
to preſerue them ſelues for ſo litle a while from
the crafty fetches and ſnares of Satan, but that
they loſt it: What maye happen vnto vs, which
are not ſo wiſe as they were, if we ſhoulde haue
the keyes and charge of ſo great and precious
a treaſure, as is the righteouſnes of the Sonne
of God?</p>
            <p>It is a great commoditie and verie good for
a tree,<note place="margin">Diuerſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes ſhewing that it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Chriſt his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhoulde be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in vs.</note> that the life and ſappe therof lyeth hidde
in the roote: For this is the meane to defende,
and preſerue it from the ſtormes and froſtes of
the winter: euen ſo is it for our profit, that our
life and our righteouſnes are in Ieſus Chriſt,
who is our foundacion and roote. For being
locked vp in ſo ſure a place, it ſhal be preſerued
and kepte for vs againſt all thoſe that woulde
robbe vs or ſnatche it awaye from vs by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or violence. We ſee that kinges and great
lordes, they neither medle nor deale with any
money, but they leaue their reuenues in the
handes of their treaſorers and receauours to
diſpoſe of them, contenting them ſelues when
they haue any neede, or other affaires, to be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7081:45"/>
puruayed and prouided for, of that which is
neceſſary: what nede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there that we ſhould
haue our goods in our owne hands, ſeeing that
we ſhall lacke nothing, that is needfull for vs?
We haue the grace of God, we are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and conſequently his heires: we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
guided, ſtrengthened, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his ſpirite: we are citizens of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and ſeruauntes of his houſeholde: to be
ſhorte, we haue all the profites, rentes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that grow of his righteouſnes: what
would we deſire more? Is it not enough that
we gather the fructe of a tree, and that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
remayne in his place, and that we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it not awaye with vs? In like manner alſo
we muſt contente our ſelues to be partakers of
the fructes of Chriſt his righteouſnes, albeit
it be not eſſentially in vs: but onely by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in aſmuch as through his onely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
it is beſtowed vpon vs.</p>
            <p>But here a doubt maye be moued,<note place="margin">Howe we maye be righteous by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of an other.</note> by the righteouſneſſe of an
other, ſeeing that this is a perſonall qualitie,
which can not be communicated to an other, no
more then health, wiſedome, ſtrength and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Now can I be otherwiſe in health, then by
the health that reſteth effectually in my bodie:
how can it be then, that I ſhoulde be righteous,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7081:45"/>
by the righteouſnes, that dwelleth in an other?
We muſt aunſwere that this is done by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
And as a man maye be acquited of his
creditour,<note place="margin">The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the debtour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by an other.</note> by the paymente which ſome ſhall
make of his owne money in the name of the
debtour: euen ſo we maye be righteous, by the
righteouſnes of an other, when he is accepted
in our name, as that is of Ieſus Chriſt, when
we are vnited and knit vnto him. All the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body without the eye,<note place="margin">The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the members of the bodie enlightened by the eye.</note> are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blinde of them ſelues, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
they ceaſe not euery daye to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
rightely. The feete go without ſtombling,
the handes without offending: in ſuch ſort that
ech one of them is led in his worke by the light
of the eye which illuminateth &amp; directeth them:
and as the ſight of the eye is communicated to
all the members of the body, who ſee by it and
in it: euen ſo we in like manner are profited by
the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
with vs, as the ſight of the eye with the
members, to the ende that we maye vſe it in
the iudgemente of God, there to be acquited
and iuſtified, and pronounced altogether inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente
and diſcharged from all our faultes and
offences.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the other point,<note place="margin">The firſt point ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by what meane, we may appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat to our ſelues the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt Ieſus.</note> which
is, to know by what meane we maye obtaine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7081:46"/>
this righteouſneſſe, and appropriate it to our
ſelues. The onely meane is Faith as we maye
know by many places of the ſcripture. For S.
Paule ſayeth that the righteouſnes of God is
by faith. Alſo: that righteouſnes is reueiled in
the Goſpell, and communicated by faith. And
in an other place:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> being iuſtified by faith, we
haue peace in our conſcience.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> And the Prophet
alſo ſayeth:<note place="margin">Abac. 2. 4.</note> That the righteous man ſhall liue
by faith. And Ieſus Chriſt, in the worde wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we altogether reſte,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 5.</note> ſayeth: that who ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
beleueth in him, ſhall not come into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And to them alwayes that were ſicke,
and were healed, he ſayth commonly, that their
faith had ſaued them, to the end to teach vs that
faith is the meane,<note place="margin">Faith is the only meane to faſten vs to Chriſt, &amp; obteine his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> which is neceſſarie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
not only righteouſnes, but alſo the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of children, the vndeſerued fauour, and
bleſſing of our God, and generally all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of Ieſus Chriſt. And altogether like as
we apprehende coullors by the ſight, &amp; ſoundes
by the eare: euen ſo we apprehende by Faith
Gods promiſes, in which he offreth life vnto vs
and all other his graces.<note place="margin">S. Ambroſe.</note> As Ambroſe ſayeth:
Faith is ſuch a vertue and of ſo great ſtrength,
that it obtaineth all that God hath promiſed vs
we beleuing in him.</p>
            <p>But when we ſpeake ſo of Faith, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7081:46"/>
not by this name a bare opinion which
we maye haue of the truth or a ſimple perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and conſent,<note place="margin">VVhat that iuſtifying Faith is.</note> wherby we allow all that is
contayned in the ſcripture: but we vnderſtand
by this Faith a liuely apprehenſion of the truth
of Gods promiſes, and an aſſurance of his
grace and fauour in Ieſus Chriſt. Alſo, a full
confidence that is ſufficient to beare all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that can be laid vpon vs, and to beate
downe death, the deuill, and all the gates of
hell, and further to ſet it ſelfe againſt wrath,
in the iudgement and malediction of God, the
which it turneth from vs as a tempeſt &amp; ſtorme
when we are threatened. Now when we earſt
ſayed that the lawe contayneth the promiſes of
God, and in them his vnderſerued fauour and
grace, as the eye doth the colour, and the eare
the ſounde, and the other ſenſes their proper
obiect: we vnderſtande this of the aſſuraunce
and certaintie onely, and not of any carnall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
For the thinges that we beleeue, they
can not be felt with the hande, nor ſeene with
the eye, nor by any reaſon, or other ſenſe of man
be comprehended, and yet neuertheles they are
more certaine, then the thinges that we feele,
becauſe our ſenſes maye be deceaued. As the
eye which wil iudge a peece of wood in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be crooked, although it be verie ſtreight:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7081:47"/>
But Faith when it is once grounded, &amp; reſteth
it ſelfe vpon the worde of God, it is aſſured of
all that is therein taught, and ſpecially it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth
Ieſus Chriſt and draweth from him
euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>And albeit that oftentimes, conſidering the
eſtate &amp; diſpoſition of thoſe matters, it ſeemeth
to vs that all thinges goe quite backwardes,
contrarie to that which God hath promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs: yet notwithſtanding, in this caſe we muſt
beleue,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> (as S. Paule ſayeth) in hope againſt
hope, and in no wiſe doubt, but his promiſes
ſhalbe accompliſhed. For ſooner ſhall heauen,
earth, and all the worlde periſh, then the leaſt
iote of that which God hath promiſed vs, and
which is proceeded from his mouth, faill to be
fully &amp; wholy accompliſhed in his time. When
our reaſon then, or ſenſe will doubte of that
which God hath ſayd, or vnſaye and murmure
againſt it, or any manner of waye, diſtruſt his
promiſes, we muſt reſiſte and ſette our ſelues
manfully with all our might againſt it, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
did: and ſtaye our ſelues (as he did)
wholly vpon this, that God alwaye hath both
will, and might to performe what ſoeuer he
hath promiſed.</p>
            <p>And when we come to conſider the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> we muſt not then doubt,
but that our faith is mightely aſſailed, and that
we haue to fight wonderfull ſharpe and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
combats: but that we maye auoyde
them, it is needeful (as in all other tentations)
to keepe our ſelues alwayes to the worde of
God, and to make it a buckler againſt all that
the deuill, our reaſon, and ſenſe can alleage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will, and thoſe promiſes that he hath
made vnto vs.<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> We muſt (as S. Auguſtine
ſayeth) ſhutte our eyes from all that we maye

            <p>Now hauing ſpoken of the meane whereby

it be neceſſarie that Faith be perfecte.
Then afterwardes, whether it muſt be, that it

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:7081:48"/>
As concerning the firſt point,<note place="margin">1. To witte, whether faith muſt be perfect for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of Ieſus Chriſt.</note> to witte, of
the perfection of the lawe, it is impoſſible that
euer we can attaine it: in as much as we are

is ſo groſſe and ſo ſlauiſh, and which fighteth
without ceaſing againſt the ſpirite, when it

it is impoſſible that euer we ſhould

it: hauing in like maner a harte entangled with
ſo great paſſions and luſtes which driues vs he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thether, to all vaine affections, in ſuch
ſort, that by reaſon hereof, we can not loue God
perfectly and ſo conſequently haue any perfect
confidence in him: becauſe confidence followeth
loue, euen like as loue followeth knowledge.</p>
            <p>The knowledge therefore and confidence
that we haue of God being imperfect, which
are the two parts of Faith, it followeth hereof,
that it can not be perfect, &amp; that we haue neede
continually to begge at Gods hande, that he
will augment it in vs, and daye by daye ſtirre
vs vp in the meditation of his promiſes, which
is the true meane to nourriſh, encreaſe, and
augmente Faith. And wherto ſerue exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7081:49"/>
prayers, Sacraments, and ſuch other
exerciſes, if our Faith coulde be perfect here?
ſeeing that all theſe are not ordeined &amp; foſtred
in the Church, to any other purpoſe, then to
fortifie, and encreaſe the knowledge, zeale and
affection of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the ſecond point.<note place="margin">2. Point whether Faith muſt be cleane from all vices.</note> Seeing
that our Faith is neuer perfect in this worlde,
but is alwayes mingled with an infinit nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of infirmities which alwayes remayne in
vs, in ſuch ſort as there is none can ſaye his
harte is cleane from all ſinne: and that we haue
neede in reſpect of this, to begge of God in our
prayers, that he will pardon vs our offences,
and making the confeſſion of our Faith, to ſay:
I beleue the remiſſion of ſinnes: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all this that, as yet our faith is very weake
&amp; defiled with many imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, neuertheles
it ceaſeth not, to laye holde vpon that, that it
ſhall pleaſe God to beſtow vpon it. No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(for examples ſake) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a litle child who
with his litle handes,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the force and ſtrength of Faith.</note> or a poore man with his
rugged, and ſcabbie handes refuſe not to take
breade and other almes, that a man will beſtow
vpon them, aſwell as if they were greater and
whole. Altogether like as diſeaſes that are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
through out the whole body,<note place="margin">An other ſimilitude.</note> (as is a
burning agewe) though they weaken all the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7081:49"/>
partes of the ſame and ſpecially the ſtomacke,
more then all the reſte: yet neuertheleſſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not but that it maye take a medecin, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the diſeaſe is an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it to prouoke
it to take it: euen ſo alſo it ought to be ſo farre
of, that the weakenes of our Faith ſhould keep
vs from embracing righteouſnes and the other
benefites of Ieſus Chriſt, that it muſt prepare
and diſpoſe vs to the contrarie:<note place="margin">Luc. 5. 35.</note> According to
which Ieſus Chriſt ſayeth to the Phariſees
who thought them ſelues to be righteous, that
he came not for their ſakes, but to call ſinners:
adding the reaſon, to witte that they that are
ſicke haue neede of the phiſition. And euen like
as our diſeaſes and infirmities let not but that
our faith, be it neuer ſo weake, is yet capable
of the graces of God, &amp; of all the righteouſnes
of his ſonne: euen ſo the littlenes of faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it not leſſe capable to be able to apprehend
and embrace that righteouſneſſe:<note place="margin">An other ſimilitude.</note> And like as
altogether the Aple of the eye which is ſo litle,
and yet, for all that can apprehend the light of
the Sunne which is ſpred ouer all the horizon,
yea and the Sunne it ſelfe which is farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more ample then all the earth: euen ſo
the eye of faith, albeit that it be verie ſmall, yet
it ceaſeth not to lay holde of the Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
together with his light, iuſtice and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7081:50"/>
other giftes, which are as great and as many
in number.</p>
            <p>But now let vs handell the laſte of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde
three pointes,<note place="margin">3. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect can loſe their faith.</note> that is to ſaye: whether
Faith being once receaued into our hartes, we
can vtterly afterwardes looſe, and forgoe it.
For if hauing once receaued it, we can not be
aſſured to keepe it conſtauntly to the ende, we
ſhall alwayes be in doubt of our ſaluation. But
if we be once perſwaded and reſolued in this
point, that hauing bene inſpired by the ſpirite
of God in our hartes, it will ſtill there abide,
and dwell there for euer: this perſwaſion will
alwayes keep our ſpirites quiet and contented,
and they ſhall alwayes be ioyefull, yea in the
middeſt of all tentations that maye aſſaile vs.
Wherfore it is very neceſſary for vs to marke,
and diligently to imprinte in our mindes, all
the places of the holy ſcripture, in which God
hath aſſured vs of the continuaunce and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce
of his grace and fauour towardes vs,
and of keping vs in the faith, and giuing of all
the other giftes that he wil communicate vpon
vs. As in the firſt place, this teſtimonie of S.
Paule woulde be marked,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> which ſayeth: that
Faith is ioyned with election, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
founded vpon the counſaile and will of
God which is euerlaſting &amp; immutable: Then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7081:50"/>
afterwards that place of the Romaines where
it is ſayd:<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29</note> That the giftes and calling of God
are without repentaunce, that is to ſaye, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable,
when he hath once giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them vnto vs.
Alſo,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 12</note> that which is ſayd in S. Matthew: That
to him that hath, it ſhall be giuen. If then, we
haue by Gods grace, Faith and the giftes of
the ſpirite, let vs be certaine that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ſtill with vs, and looke by the ſelfe ſame
grace that they were freely beſtowed vpon vs,
by the ſame they ſhall be keept and encreaſed.
Alſo there is an other place of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> that
all they which were predeſtinate to life ſhall
afterwarde be called, iuſtified, and in the ende
glorified: If theſe fower pointes, wherein is
contained the whole ſumme of the ſaluation of
God his children be ſo chained in order one to
the other, by an immutable decree of God: we
muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that as our election is ſure, ſtable
&amp; permanent, ſo alſo are the other effectes that
do neceſſaryly follow it: Alſo that which S.
Iohn ſayeth in his firſt Epiſtle:<note place="margin">1. Iohn 5. 18.</note> that he that is
borne of God ſinneth not, and the wicked tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
him not, Alſo: that goodly proteſtation
that the Apoſtle maketh for him ſelfe and all
the faithfull,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note> with ſo great aſſuraunce. I am
(ſayth he) certaine, that there is neither death,
nor life, nor Angells, nor principalities, nor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7081:51"/>
powers, nor thinges preſent, nor thinges to
come, nor thinges highe, nor thinges lowe, nor
any creature, that ſhalbe able to ſeparate vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the loue of God which is in Ieſus Chriſt our
Lorde.<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 23.</note> Alſo, that which Ieſus Chriſt ſayeth
to his diſciples: If any man loue me he will
keepe my worde, and my father will loue him,
and we wil come vnto him and dwell with him.
Whereupon we maye note that he ſayeth not,
We will viſite him, and ſo departe againe, as
many times we ſee freindes doe viſite one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but he ſayeth, we will abide with him:
which is as much to ſaye: We will holde our
ſelues to him, and dwell continually with him,
without euer departing from him.</p>
            <p>By all theſe places, and many more which
might be rehearſed out of the ſcripture, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
plainly that faith being once giuen vs
of God, it ſhall neuer be quite taken away from
vs, and ſo by conſequence neither the grace of
God, which alwayes followeth it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it ſeeme oftentimes for deade, as it was
in Dauid, when he committed ſo great and
heinous ſinnes one after an other: yet for all
that, there remained alwayes in his harte, a
certaine remnaunte of it, which for a time was
hidde as fire is vnder the Aſhes. And like as
when it is raked vp it ſheweth not his brighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7081:51"/>
nor heate outwardly, vntill it be vnraked
and kindled in a flambe: euen ſo, it oftentimes
falleth out with our faith, which is hidden and
couered with many vices, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt holyeſt
Sainctes of God them ſelues doe many times
committe (euen as to fall into diſeaſes) the
which continueth, till it pleaſe God to ſtirre vs
vp a new by his ſpirite, and to light vs againe,
euen like as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a candle is put out. We muſt
iudge then of our faith, as of a tree, which in
wiuter ſeemeth to be deade, becauſe it hath no
fruit nor leaues nor any outward appearaunce
of life: and yet notwithſtanding it ceaſeth not to
liue, &amp; ſheweth that life, that was hidden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
outwardly, in the ſpringe time, bringing
forth flowers and leaues, and taking againe
his goodly hewe: in ſo much as the ſappe and
ſtrength which keepte it ſelfe encloſed in the
roote during the time of the colde, ſpreadeth it
ſelfe throughout all the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, to make them
greene and freſh againe: Euen ſo likewiſe is it
of Faith, which ſeemeth oftentimes to be quite
dead in vs, when it bringeth not forth any ſenſe
or feeling neither of God, nor of his promiſes,
nor of his commaundements or threateninges:
And ſheweth not it ſelfe by any other wonted
effect. Notwithſtanding this, it is aliue in vs,
and the life of it hath his being in Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7081:52"/>
in whome it is ingraffed &amp; planted. And as the
ſtrength of this roote can neither be froſen nor
deade: euen ſo neither can the Faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
which is ſo depelie grounded within be
altogether extinguiſhed and deade being the
roote of all immortalitie, from whence it fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
his life.</p>
            <p>But before we ende this matter,<note place="margin">Howe the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ieſus Chriſt maye be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to conſider one wonderfull thing, to witte,
how the righteouſnes of Chriſt, which is one
onely, maye be alſo entierly diſtributed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of his members, without being deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ſundred in any reſpect.</p>
            <p>To aunſwere this point, a man maye ſaye
of it, as certaine Philoſophers haue ſayd of the
ſoule of man,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſoule.</note> which is wholly throughout the
whole body, and in euery parte a like: euen ſo
is the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt, wholly in
the bodye of the whole church, as the ſoule, to
giue it life and to mainteine it. Then is it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in euery of the particular members, to
make them ſtrong, whole, ſtowt and of courage
to doe all their offices and duties. The which
thing a man maye vnderſtande by two ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
one is of the voice, which being hearde
of a great many perſons, is in ſuch ſort recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of euery one of them,<note place="margin">Similitudes of the voice &amp; the face.</note> prouided that they be
attentiue, that the ſame is wholly vnderſtoode,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7081:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without beinge deuided or ſundred in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte.
The other ſimilitude is of the face
which maye be receaued in many glaſſes, and
wholly repreſented to all, without any diuiſion
or ſeparation of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Let vs conclude then that a faithfull man
through faith embraceth the whole righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and all the fructes of the ſacrifice of Ieſus
Chriſt: and that, for this cauſe he can not be
condemned or accurſed before Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
no more then his head with whome he is in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
knitte &amp; vnited. When any man is faln
into the water where he is vp euen to the chin,
if he cannot be hurt, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as his head is aboue
the water: although that all the members and
partes of his body be drowned and foundred: ſo
alſo we cannot be ſtiffled or hurt in the deapths
of death,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> ſeeing that Ieſus Chriſt our heade, is
alwayes lift vp aboue thoſe deapths, &amp; for that
vppon the life and health of him dependes the
health and ſaluation of all his members.</p>
            <p>Now it is time to ſhew by what ſignes and
markes we maye know,<note place="margin">Howe we maye know whether Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt dwell in vs or no?</note> whether we poſſeſſe
Ieſus Chriſt, and whether he dwell in vs and
we in him. S. Paule ſayeth to the Romains:
that being iuſtified by Faith, we haue peace in
our ſoules:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> which is an vndoubted token that
Chriſt dwelleth in our hartes, that is to ſaye:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7081:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when we feele there tranquilitie and reſte, and
that we beginne to be peaceable in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:
torments, bytinges, anguiſhes, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and diſtruſtes there ceaſing: and when in
the ſted of all theſe, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in place, ioye,
pleaſure, conſolation, and as it were a common
feaſt where all reioyce. For then Ieſus Chriſt
liueth in vs and we in him: to witte, when all
our thoughtes, our meditations, our workes
and our delightes, doe carrie vs to him, as to
the marke: And when we ſette him out to our
ſelues, to be our onely glorie, honour, riches,
treaſure, and the grounde of all our hopes: and
that we holde him as our cheife and ſoueraigne
good, that is to ſaye: when we neither knowe,
deſire, or ſeeke after any other but him: and that
we are enlightened, by his light and ſpirite, are
made wiſe through his wiſedome, and ſtronge
through his ſtrength, and riche through his
bleſſinges, and righteous through his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and bleſſed through his grace and fauour:
&amp; when we will haue no other maiſter to teach
vs, nor other light to leade vs, nor other ſight
to direct vs, nor other truth to deliuer vs, nor
other life to quicken vs, nor other king to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
and defende vs, nor other mediatour to
reconcile vs, and make vs at one with God, nor
other aduocat to pleade our cauſe in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7081:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor other gate to enter in at to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nor to make vs there reioyce of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and full felicitie, which he hath reſerued &amp;
keept for his elect. And in generall, when we
neither ſeeke, nor will haue other fountaine to
quenche our thirſt, nor to ſatiſfie our deſires.
See then howe Ieſus Chriſt liueth in vs and
we in him.</p>
            <p>It is verie true that the feeling,<note place="margin">The perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities and doubtes that are in the ſpiritual life of the faithfull.</note> which we
haue of all theſe thinges, is not alwayes a like
and the ſame in vs. For aſmuch as we are not
alwayes a like diſpoſed, at one time as at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and we haue not alwayes a like deſire to
ſee or to heare the worde of God, or to reade it,
or to conferre with our brethern, which are
more aduaunced in the knowledge and zeale of
the ſeruice of God then we are. And likewiſe
the ſpirite of God doth not touch and ſtirre vs
vp alwayes a like. And this is the cauſe that in
our faith, as in all other qualities, there is ſome
time more and ſome time leſſe, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is more ſtrong &amp; liuely, and then ſome
times againe more remiſſe and fainte.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
like as we ſee that water is more hoat
or colde, according as it is neare or farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the fire: euen ſo is it with vs, according as we
are more or leſſe exerciſed in the word, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by Gods ſpirit, we haue more or leſſe zeale
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7081:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and affection. And altogether like as the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the bodye followeth the qualitie and
temperature of the aire, elementes and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
to which we giue our ſelues: euen ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the places where we liue, and the
nouriſhment that we there take, is the eſtate of
our ſoules and conſciences. But be it that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be ſometime hoate and ſometime colde, and
that it chaunge his qualities, ſometimes one
waye, ſometimes an other, yet is it alwayes
water: euen ſo the man that is electe after his
regeneration, is alwayes faithfull, how ſo euer
in that he is the childe of Adam, he be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
enclined to euill, and that his faith is not
alwayes in one and the ſelfe ſame eſtate, and
that he is not alwayes accompanied with the
like zeale and affection. For oftentimes it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paſſe that we fele Ieſus Chriſt to ſtirre
and moue him ſelfe in vs, and by and by after,
we haue no manner of feeling at all: but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ceaſeth not to dwell in vs, no more then
our ſoules do to dwell in our bodies when we
ſleepe, although in ſleeping we neither feele
them, nor any of their operations. A woman
who hath conceaued and beareth in her wombe
a younge childe, feeleth it not alwayes ſtirre,
notwithſtanding when ſhe hath felt it once or
twiſe, ſhe doubteth not but ſhe is with childe:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7081:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
euen ſo it commeth to paſſe that we haue not a
continuall feeling of Ieſus Chriſt, to aſſure vs
that he dwelleth in vs and we in him: but it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fizeth
that we haue him when occaſion ſerueth.</p>
            <p>There are ſome alſo that feele and taſte in
ſome ſort the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt: but
on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide they haue a farre greater feeling
of their ſinnes, which oftentimes maketh them
to feare that they are not in God his fauour.
Concerning this point we muſt note, that we
more feele that which is euill, then that which
is good. For as we ſee by experience, we feele
the calamities and miſeries of warre more then
the fruicts and pleaſures of peace, &amp; the griefes
of diſeaſes, more then the quietnes of health, &amp;
the hardenes of pouertie, more then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
and commodities of aboundance &amp; riches:
by reaſon whereof we ought not much to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
if we feele the ſtinginges and prickes of
ſinne a great deale more then the conſolations
of the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt: ſeeing that
ſinne dwelleth in vs &amp; not righteouſnes, which
thing is in cauſe that the one is more ſenſible
then the other: Notwithſtanding for all this
we muſt not thinke, that ſinne is greater and
ſtronger then righteouſnes, or that it can in any
reſpecte be compared vnto it, or can be more
able to condemne and deſtroye vs, then the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7081:55"/>
righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt and the grace of
God is,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> to iuſtifie and ſaue vs. We haue ſome
times in the toppe of a finger, ſome paine or
greife, which we feele a great deale more then
the health that is all ouer the reſte of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
yea though it be much greater then the
paine of our finger. Wherefore we muſt not
eſteme the greatnes or the ſtrength, whether it
be of righteouſnes or ſinne, according to that
feeling we haue: becauſe the one is alwayes
more ſenſible then the other: and ſpecially for
aſmuch as we embrace righteouſnes onely by
faith which is of thoſe thinges that are not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
and ſenſible.</p>
            <p>There are others alſo that feele nothing elſe
but their ſinnes:<note place="margin">A remedie againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>entation of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual feeling of our ſinne onely.</note> and therefore they liue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
feare and diſtruſte, where out they can
not winde them ſelues, hauing no taſte at all of
the grace and righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt,
nor of any other meane, whereby it is graunted
vnto vs. Which thing (of a truth) is verie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
and they which feele them ſelues in
ſuch caſe ought earneſtly to praye vnto God,
that it will pleaſe him to quicken them vp, and
to warme them through his ſpirite. And on
their part it behoueth that they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues
oftentimes to reade and to meditate vpon his
promiſes, and that they frequente the Church,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7081:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and heare exhortations, with the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
they can, for aſmuch as Faith is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
by hearing. And although it come to
paſſe that they doe all theſe thinges without
any great affection,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we muſt not be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged though we finde not alwayes in our ſelues that good deſire and taſte that we ought to haue, of the worde of God.</note> yet muſt they not therfore
thinke, that they are altogether vnprofitable
vnto them, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man that taketh bread
and meate when he taketh and eateth it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great appetite. For although that he
haue not ſuch a pleaſure in eating, as if he were
well an houngred: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that which
he receaueth, ceaſeth not to profite and ſuſteine
him, as we ſee in ſickenes: euen ſo do prayers
and other Chriſtian exerciſes, to which ſuch
colde perſons do giue them ſelues. And how
ſo euer they make them without any greate
zeale, yet for all that they ceaſe not to profite
them. And in euery thinge that commeth to
paſſe, howe ſoeuer it be that they feele their
ſinnes, they declare thereby that they are not
altogether deade, nor vtterly depriued of life,
and that therefore it onely remayneth for them
to ſearch the meanes how to encourage them
ſelues, and to doe euen as a man woulde doe to
fire, when it is out, which when he will kindle
againe, he bloweth it, or to a lampe to which
a man putteth oyle when the lighte is going
out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:7081:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There are other ſome which neither haue
feeling of righteouſnes nor of their ſinnes,<note place="margin">A remedie againſt the ſpirituall blockiſhnes or lacke of feeling.</note> and
theſe are altogether blockiſh, not thinking any
whit of their ſafetie, nor regarding to hearken
vnto anything that is ſpoken, taught or ſhewed
to them for their helpe and recouery. Such diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
are verie dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous as are to mans body
Apoplexies,<note place="margin">Apoplexia is a diſeaſe engendred of colde hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that taketh away a mannes ſenſes and feeling.</note> the falling ſicknes, Palſeyes and
ſuch other which are altogether colde, killing
the naturall heate, and choking all the ſenſes.
All that we can doe for theſe, is to praye vnto
God to heale them, as he did the man ſicke of
the Palſeye, and that he will reſtore to them
the vſe of their ſenſes, that they maye feele aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
the burden and waite of their ſinnes, as
alſo the conſolation of his grace.</p>
            <p>The laſte point,<note place="margin">The laſte pointe is of the effectes of this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes in vs after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation &amp; that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth 4. partes.</note> that we haue to entreate of
is of the effectes, that this righteouſnes brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth in vs after our regeneration: wherof
there are fower principall partes.</p>
            <p>The firſt is of the mortification of the fleſh:
The ſecond of the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Faith. The third
of prayers: and the laſt, of charitie.</p>
            <p>Mortification of the fleſh conſiſteth in this,
that we ſuffer not ſinne to reigne in vs: but cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly
fight againſt all the concupiſcences
thereof,<note place="margin">1. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the fleſh.</note> obaying the ſpirite of the lawe of God,
and groning continually vnder the burden of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7081:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our infirmities, crying to God without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that in this caſe he will make an ende, and
prouide for vs.</p>
            <p>Confeſſion conſiſteth in this,<note place="margin">2. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of Faith.</note> that we pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the meanes of our ſaluation, and that we
witneſſe it openly and euidently by our workes
and wordes, at all times when occaſion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
vnto vs: without being hindred through
the feare of any daunger what ſoeuer.</p>
            <p>As concerning prayers,<note place="margin">3. Prayers.</note> it is neceſſarie that
euening and morning, before and after meate,
and in the beginning and ending of all our
workes, we praye vnto God and praiſe him,
begging that in our prayers which he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
vs to axe, and promiſed to giue vnto
vs, with full Faith and aſſuraunce to obteine
them: which we muſt grounde vpon his grace
and promiſes, and vpon the merite and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Ieſus Chriſt our alone Mediatour.</p>
            <p>As touching loue,<note place="margin">4. Charitie.</note> firſt of all it is required
that we loue God with all our hearte, with all
our ſtrength and with all our vnderſtanding,
and then our neighbour as our ſelfe, the which
loue of our neighbour that it maye be righte it
muſt be referred to that loue of God in ſuch
wiſe that it be the rule and meaſure thereof,
and likewiſe of all other our affections.</p>
            <p>Now in obſeruing of theſe fower poinctes,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7081:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we muſt firſt take heede that we be not dull and
ſlothfull to do our indeuour therein. The which
thing that we maye auoide, we muſt ſeeke out
with all diligence euery occaſion to applie our
ſelues thereto, and take heede to auoide thoſe
thinges which maye turne vs awaye from it.
Then afterwardes we muſt beware that in no
wiſe we diſtruſte the grace of God, nor the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
that we offer vp vnto him, but that we be
certainly perſwaded, that we together with our
workes, ſhalbe acceptable vnto him, through
grace, That hauing this perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may go
faithfully &amp; cheerefully forward in our vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>And finally, that we take good heede to our
ſelues,<note place="margin">VVe muſt auoide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; an opinion of our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</note> that aboue all thinges we be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpteous.
And to the ende, to keepe vs from
it, it is not enough, that we haue no opinion of
our ſelues nor of our workes: but as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Pſalme: we muſt not deſire any
thing that is to highe for vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 131. 1</note> but be contente
with that porcion and meaſure of grace, that it
hath pleaſed God to beſtow vpon vs, and we
muſt applie our ſelues according to that power
and meane that he hath giuen vs: As S. Peter
ſayeth:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 10</note> Let euery man as he hath receaued the
gifte, miniſter the ſame one to an other as a
good houſband and ſtewarde of the graces and
gifts of God. For if we haue receaued but two
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7081:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tallentes, and wil make as great traffique with
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he that hath receaued fiue, this is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
before God, who hath meaſured out
and proportioned his giftes to our capacitie,
and requireth of profites and gaines according
to the quantitie of thoſe graces &amp; giftes which
he hath beſtowed vpon vs.</p>
            <p>We haue ſaide in the beginning that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
iudgement wherto we muſt anſwere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our righteouſnes,<note place="margin">The ſecond iudgement where we muſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> is that of the lawe,
which is no other thing then the ſeate of Gods
righteouſnes, to which it is impoſſible for vs
of our ſelues to ſatiſfie, and we haue neither
workes, thoughtes, wordes, nor affections but
they are to be condemned of God, if proceſſe be
made out there for vs, &amp; we be to be iudged in
this courte:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> as S. Paule ſayeth that all they
which are vnder the lawe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 7.</note> are vnder the Curſe:
and in an other place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 2</note> he calleth the law the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Death. And Dauid ſpeaking to God
ſayeth: Enter not into iudgement with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant:
For no man liuing ſhalbe iuſtified in thy
ſight:<note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3</note> Alſo in an other place he ſayeth: O Lord
if thou looke vpon our iniquities, who ſhall
ſtande in thy iudgement? For aſmuch as this
iudgement is ſo entier, where all thinges are
examined, in ſuch ſort, from point to point, that
the brighteneſſe and lighte of the moone and
ſtarres, the righteouſnes and innocencie of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7081:58"/>
Angells, ſhall hardly eſcape from being reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and cenſured,<note place="margin">Iob 25. 5.</note> as Iob ſayth. How then ſhall
we be able to aunſwere there,<note place="margin">Iob 4. 18.</note> and what meanes
ſhall we alleage for our iuſtification, that we
maye eſcape?<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 12.</note> S. Paule ſayth, They that haue
ſinned without the lawe, ſhall periſh without
the lawe. But ſeeing that they ſhall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the lawe, who haue tranſgreſſed it: what
ſhall we do then? we can aunſwere and alleage
many thinges for our defence.</p>
            <p>Firſt we can auoide this iudgement and
ridde our ſelues from it demaunding to be ſent
before the throne of Gods mercye:<note place="margin">The waye how to be deliuered from the iudgement and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the lawe.</note> foraſmuch
as being free and deliuered, we are not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
vnder the lawe, but vnder grace: ſo as
Moiſes is not nowe any more our Iudge but
Ieſus Chriſt: to whom the father hath giuen
aucthoritie and iudgement.<note place="margin">Galat. 4. 7.</note> Moreouer mercye
(as S. Iames ſayeth) is aboue righteouſnes:<note place="margin">Iohn 5. 22.</note>
which is as an inferiour and lower courte,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 13.</note> from
which we may appeale to that highe and great
courte of God his mercie: wherin Ieſus Chriſt
is ſette downe and keepeth the higheſt place as
chiefe preſidente. And as it is he that is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate,
ſo we are aſſured that he will giue vs
a diſcharge in our fauour. Wherefore if the
lawe, Moiſes and the righteouſnes of God doe
condemne vs, we muſt not therefore be afraide:
foraſmuch as this is ſuch a ſimple ſentence,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7081:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as we maye at all times appeale from it. To
conclude, the lawe is as a receauer, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
accompte of our debtes, which is ſo harde
and rigorous that by no intreatie it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
and pardon any thing of that we owe, and
will make vs to pay to the vttermoſt farthing:
But the Lord is he that ſtayeth &amp; cloſeth vp the
counte, to witte Ieſus Chriſt, being (contrary
to the law) good, gracious and liberall, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vs with all gentlenes, neither demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any thing of vs but that which we be able
to paye, and furniſhing vs him ſelfe with that
which we lacke, and acquiting vs of his mere
liberalitie of the ouerplus, ſo that preſently it
maye be ſupplyed in him.</p>
            <p>Furthermore we maye yet alleage in this
iudgement, that the lawe can not make our
proceſſe: but Ieſus Chriſt, and the mercie of
God be our aſſeſſours, who moderate iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſuch ſort, that not onely it can not be
hurtefull vnto vs, but very healthfull for vs. As
the iudgement of the woman taken in adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the figure therof:<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 3. An allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our exemption from the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the lawe by Ieſus Chriſt.</note> who being threatened
before Ieſus Chriſt, by the Phariſees, who
maintayned that by the lawe of Moiſes ſhe
ought to be ſtoned to death, was notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all that they coulde alleage, ſente awaye
by Ieſus Chriſt, without her accuſers, or any
others that were in their companie, once inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7081:59"/>
to hurte her in any ſorte what ſo euer:
Onely Ieſus Chriſt ſayth vnto her, that henſe
forwarde ſhe muſt take heede that ſhe ſinned no
more: and ſo that condemnation which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the law had pronounced againſt her,
was by Chriſt, turned into a ſimple admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and inſtruction. A thing that ought well to be
marked,<note place="margin">The vſe of the lawe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the faithfull.</note> to the ende we maye vnderſtand what
ought now a dayes to be the true vſe of the
lawe towardes the faithfull: which condemneth
them no more to death as it was wont, but tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
and enſtructeth them of their deutie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
them to that, and reproueth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth,
by all meanes ſo to direct, and bring
them on, as they maye be ſufficiently enabled
to goe to the ſchoole of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The lawe and Ieſus Chriſt in like manner
are as a Phiſicion and ſurgeon,<note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the lawe &amp; the Goſpel.</note> comming to a
ſicke man to heale him. The ſurgeon openeth
the veine, and taketh awaye bloude from him,
not to the ende to make him to dye, but as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
appointed for the recouerie of his health
and ſauetie. The lawe alſo peirceth our impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume,
&amp; ſometimes maketh a great hole in it:
but neither to the ende to kill vs, nor to hurte
vs: but to bring vs into a good order, to the end
we may be the more eaſely healed. Thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
then, that the lawe pronounceth againſt
vs, they are profitable for vs, for aſmuch as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7081:59"/>
they awaken vs and make vs to looke to our
ſelues and to our affaires, and to be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to ſearch out the meanes wherby to bring
vs into good order.</p>
            <p>The laſt bulwarke that we can ſet againſt
the iudgement of the lawe,<note place="margin">The third meane, or defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the iudgement of the law.</note> is that Ieſus Chriſt
hath fulfilled the ſame for vs, as he him ſelfe
witneſſeth: that he came not to aboliſh the law,
but to fulfil it. Which thing S. Paule alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
ſaying:<note place="margin">Mar. 5. 17.</note> that Chriſt is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
of the lawe in righteouſnes to all bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note>
Wherfore we be not, in any wife ſubiect
to death, nor to the curſe, that the lawe hath
pronounced againſt them, that haue tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, ſeeing we are the members of Ieſus
Chriſt, and that we haue keept and fulfilled it
in him. And as in Adam we were made ſinners
through diſobedience: euen ſo being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into Ieſus Chriſt, we are righteous
through his obedience: and ſo conſequently
exempte from the iuriſdiction and power of the
lawe: which can not exerciſe the aucthoritie, it
hath to condemne vs, but againſt them, that
tranſgreſſe, and are rebellious againſt it. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
therfore we endeuour our ſelues, to do our deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to mortifie, through his ſpirite the workes
of the fleſh, there is not any condemnation to
vs, nor to all them that are in Ieſus Chriſt,
who are by a liuely Faith vnited to him,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7081:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; incorporated into his righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>The third kinde of iudgement whereof we
ſpake in the beginning of our diuiſion is the
iudgement of men:<note place="margin">The third iudgement againſt vs, to witte, the iudgement of men and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of the ſame.</note> which commonly is more
corrupte and vniuſte, by reaſon of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
&amp; falſe opinions, which they conceaue
&amp; frame in their owne vnderſtanding: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
becauſe of their paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and deſires, which
often times driue and carry them hedlong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to their wil. Wherfore we muſt not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our ſelues much to ſatiſfie that, eſpecially in
matters that appertaine to religion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
As in the doctrine of ſaluation, which
we muſt not take from any other, but from the
ſpirite of God, nor ſearch for it any where elſe
but in the lawe and the Goſpell: where all is
taught by the writinges of the Prophetes and
Apoſtles. Wherefore there is no other rule of
our Faith and obedience, but the onely will
of God, that is to ſaye we ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
any thing, as concerning our ſaluation,
but that which he hath promiſed in his holy
Goſpell, nor doe any thing for his ſeruice, but
that which he hath commaunded and ordeined
in his lawe. And when ſo euer it be founde, that
men will be ſo raſhe either to adde,<note place="margin">Our faith muſt not depend v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon others.</note> or to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
or to alter any thing in the worde of God,
there a man maye iudge, and ſurely perſwade
him ſelfe of ſuch, that they are falſe teachers
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7081:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and prophets: and ſo likewiſe of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
&amp; ſubmitte them ſelues vnto ſuch by whom
they are abuſed and deceaued. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why S. Paule ſayeth, that if he woulde
pleaſe men, he ſhoulde not be the ſeruaunt of
Ieſus Chriſt. And in an other place: If an
Angell from heauen ſhoulde teache any other
Goſpell then that Ieſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
haue publiſhed,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8. 10</note> that he woulde accompt
him accurſed. It is therefore needefull to be
taught that in theſe thinges, belonging to the
honour and ſeruice of God, and to the ſaluation
and reſt of our ſoules, we reſte our ſelues alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vpon the ſcripture, and thereto bend our
ſelues as to the onely marke, that we neither
haſt to much forwarde, nor lagge to much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.
And further that we hange not vpon the
iudgement of men, as whereby we maye either
be iuſtified or condemned.</p>
            <p>Sainct Paule writing to the Corinthians
ſayeth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 3. 4. &amp;c.</note> I paſſe litle to be iudged of you, or of
the iudgement of men, no I iudge not my owne
ſelfe: foraſmuch as I know my ſelfe not to be
culpable in any thinge, yet am I not thereby
iuſtified: but he that iudgeth me is the Lorde.
Therefore iudge not before the time, before
the Lorde come, who will bringe all thinges
to light, manifeſtinge the thinges that are
hidde, and all the counſailes and affections of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7081:61"/>
the harte: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal euery one be praiſed of God.
Hereby he would teache vs not much to eſteme
the iudgement of men be it in good or euill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are vaine of their owne nature, and
if they praiſe vs, this ought not to puffe vs vp,
or to encreaſe the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue of our ſelues.
Alſo if they diſpraiſe or condemne vs, we ought
not therein to diſcourage our ſelues hauing the
ſpirite of God, his worde and our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
to ſuſteine and iuſtifie vs.</p>
            <p>We are at this day excommunicated of the
Pope, and condemned and reiected from his
preſence and of the moſt parte of men: and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
of them, who are in greateſt eſtimation
and credit of knowledge and wiſdom, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
concerning the Pope, we ought to
make no reckoning of him nor of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
that he can pronounce and thunder out againſt
vs. For he is the enemie of Ieſus Chriſt, and
conſequently Antichriſt: and an enemie of the
light, foraſmuch as all his workes are euil: and
of the truth, being the firſt Embaſſadour and
miniſter of lying: and to conclude, an vtter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, and of the honour of
God. Alſo he is the ſonne of perdition, to caſt
awaye and to deſtroye all thoſe, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende
on his aucthoritie, and wilbe brought to
his opinion touching the eſtate and ſaluation of
their conſcience. Is not this he which beareth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7081:61"/>
the name of blaſphemie vppon his forhead,<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 1.</note> to
ſhewe that he woulde be the protectour? It is
not therfore to be meruailed at, if he condemne
and holde thoſe for heretiques, which loue the
honour of God, and employ them ſelues to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As concerning the great and wiſe men of
this world we ought not alſo to diſcourage our
ſelues, if they ſette them ſelues with all their
ſtrength againſt the truth, wherof they haue no
knowledge as Ieſus Chriſt ſayeth:<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25.</note> that his
father hath hidde from the great and wiſe of
the worlde, the miſteries of the kingdome of
heauen, and hath reueiled them to litle ones.
According to which S. Paule ſayeth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 23.</note> that he
preached Ieſus Chriſt crucified, which was
an offence to the Iewes, and fooliſhneſſe to the
Grecians: alleaging that which is written in
Eſaie:<note place="margin">Iaſy 29. 14.</note> I will deſtroye the wiſdome of the wiſe,
and will caſte awaye the vnderſtanding of the
prudente. And adioining that ſame queſtion.
Where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where
is the diſputer of this worlde? Hath not God
made the wiſedome of this worlde fooliſhnes?
Ieremie ſayeth alſo,<note place="margin">Iere. 5. 5.</note> ſeeing the people to make
no accompte of his worde: I will get me vnto
the great men, and will ſpeake vnto them. For
they haue knowen the waye of the Lord, which
the people knew not. But theſe alſo haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7081:62"/>
the yoke, and haue banded them ſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to ſpeake againſt the worde of God, as
the others. All theſe places ſerue to ſhew vnto
vs, that God hath choſen the fooliſh thinges
of the world, to confounde the wiſe. And hereof
it is, that we ſee nowe a dayes that the greateſt
men and they that are of moſt reputation in the
worlde, do moſt obſtinatly reſiſte the truth: and
ſhewe by worde and effectes, that they are moſt
blinde in God his matters, taking darkenes for
light, ſower for ſweete, and ſweete for ſower.</p>
            <p>Now as the greatnes and aucthoritie of men
ought not to aſtoniſh vs, nor any whit to moue
vs, ſo alſo, neither the nomber and multitude
of them.<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13.</note> Foraſmuch as the waye that leadeth
to deſtruction is broade, and is choſen of the
greateſt nomber of perſones who enter there,
and goe on in it becauſe that men are naturally
enclined to embrace errours and lyes, and their
is none, but the elect of God which beleue and
loue the truth: who are a litle nomber (as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt ſayeth) in reſpect of the reprobate.</p>
            <p>We conclude then, that to the ende we be
righteous it is not needful that we ſatiſfie men,
nor conforme our ſelues to their iudgement, in
matters that concerne the honour and ſeruice
of almighty God, &amp; the eſtate of the conſcience:
wherin ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times they erre, becauſe they leaue
the worde of God which is the only way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7081:62"/>
by a man maye well and rightely iudge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
of theſe two poincts, and betake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues
to the iudgement and definition of their owne
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and phantaſeis, which are for the moſt
parte fonde and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>There are two thinges in which we maye
applie our ſelues to mans iudgement,<note place="margin">Of the vſe of ciuill &amp; politique thinges.</note> that is to
ſay, to thinges meerly ciuill &amp; politique, and to
thinges indifferent. For it muſt not be that a
faithfull man be partiall in policie, neither that
he violate the publique peace, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he may
keepe it &amp; mainteine it without offence to God,
or trouble to the quiet of his conſcience. But it
behoueth that he obaye the ordinaunces of the
Magiſtrate, and keep the ſtatutes, lawes &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of the countrey where he dwelleth, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
watching that he giue no occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
nor ſuſpicion that he will innouate or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any thinge in the eſtate and policie of the
common wealth.</p>
            <p>As concerning thinges indifferent,<note place="margin">Of the vſe of thinges indifferent.</note> we muſt
follow the counſaill of S. Auguſtine writing to
Ianuarius:<note place="margin">S. Auguſtin</note> that when the thing that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

&amp; not gaine ſtand in any thing what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to keep peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe with whom
we are conuerſaunt. For which cauſe Vitcor
Biſhop of Rome, was ſharpely reproued by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7081:63"/>
Ireneus &amp; other auncient fathers: becauſe that
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuerſitie of ceremonies, which they kept
in the celebration of Eaſter, he had ſeparated
his Church from the Communion of the Eaſte
churches. The which thing was attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him for great preſumption and arrogancie,
that he would go about, to ſubiect all Churches
to the Cuſtomes and ceremonies which were
obſerued in his: and for hauing renounced the
common confederation, in which he ought to
haue abidden vnited and faſt knitte, and not to
haue broken the chaine of charity, which ought
to haue locked together alike all the members
of the vniuerſall Church.</p>
            <p>The laſt indgement to which we muſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,<note place="margin">The fourth &amp; laſt iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, which is that of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note>
is that of our conſcience, which either
miniſtreth vnto vs great conſolations, or elſe
great torments, according as it is either euill
or well diſpoſed. For we may ſaye that a pure
conſcience, is a paradiſe, which we maye haue
in this worlde:<note place="margin">A good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a paradiſe in this worlde.</note> foraſmuch as there is not any
thing which can bring vs greater peace &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentmente,
be it in proſperitie or in aduerſitie.
Euen like as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie when it is in good health,
is ſtrong and able to beare the great ſtormes &amp;
colde of winter,<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and likewiſe the exceſſiue and

that is whole, &amp; fully reſolued, can beare
ſtowtely all accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, without yeelding or ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7081:63"/>
vnder the burden and waight of any thing
what ſo euer may happen vnto it.<note place="margin">An euill conſcience a hell.</note> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe
an euill and ſicke conſcience is a verie hell, and
there is nothing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world that may more vexe
&amp; tormente vs. And as a good conſcience is as
ſuger to ſweeten and mollifie all our affections:
euen ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other is as ſharpe vinegre, which ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
&amp; troubleth all our ioyes and conſolations:
And moreouer as the one is ſufficient to reſiſt
all tentations: euen ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other is ſofte, cowardly
&amp; vanquiſhed aſſone as it is aſſailed. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
therefore that as we are curious in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to the health of our bodies, obſeruing for
that purpoſe, the diete and gouernment that is
deliuered &amp; appointed by the phiſition vnto vs,
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe abſtaining from all thoſe meats,
&amp; exceſſe which may offende &amp; alter our health:
euen ſo that we haue the ſame deſire and care to
preſerue that health of our ſoules, marking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
all the rules and ordinaunces of good
life, which God the moſt highe and ſoueraigne
phiſition hath appointed vs, and taking heede
on the other ſide, to auoide and ſhun that, which
he hath prohibited and forbidden vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs conſider a litle, what great pleaſure
and ioye a man may haue, who returning home
after a long iornie into his owne houſe, findeth
there his wife, who commeth to take him about
the necke, and embraceth him, kiſſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7081:64"/>
much of him: doth not this make him by
and by to forgette all his trauell which he hath
endured in his iorney? as contrarywiſe, if he
ſhould find his wife after his returne brawling,
riotous, frowarde, &amp; who in ſted of comforting
him, would all maner of wayes vexe &amp; torment
him, woulde not this encreaſe and double his
paines and torments which he hath ſuffred by
the way? Euen ſuch is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtate of the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
Although that our enemies commit a thouſand
outrages, violencies &amp; villanies againſt vs: If
we returning from our ſelues, and entring into
our own conſcience, find there one with a chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; merrie countenaunce, which doth comfort
and contente vs, it maketh vs in a momente to
forgette all our enemies. But on the other ſide,
if it be naught, it weryeth vs in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
ſhal not find any houſe worſe then our owne, nor
any place where we maye worſe quiet our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,<note place="margin">Iſai 28. 20.</note>
then with our ſelues. Iſaie ſayth: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an euill
couſcience is as a ſtreighte bed,<note place="margin">A fine ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> in which a man
can not ſtretch him ſelfe, nor turne him ſelfe at
pleaſure. It is an hard thing for a man there to
ſleepe well and to reſt quietly: Likewiſe a man
which hath a feſtred co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, he can not finde
any place or condicion to contente him, &amp; which
is not altogether to ſtreighte for him. This is
the cauſe that Dauid ſo often prayeth to God
that he wil ſet his impriſoned harte at large,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 2.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:7081:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is to ſay, that he wil ſhew him this fauour, that
he may alwayes haue a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; vpright co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p>Now to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end we may haue ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">The way to haue a good conſcience.</note>
it behoueth that it be will fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: &amp; that it may
be well founded, it is requiſite that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only word
of God be the foundation therof: ſo as we make
no conſcience, but to do thoſe thinges that God
hath forbidden &amp; to leaue vndone thoſe thinges
that he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. For aſmuch as he that
wil ſtretch out his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience beyond this, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how to ſaue him ſelfe, but that ranging
beyond the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Gods word, he muſt haue
infinit ſcruples, which ſhall vexe him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And to be ſhort, there is nothing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde
more pernitious, nor more to be feared, then to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce about ſuch imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or
about the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements &amp; traditions of men.</p>
            <p>But here muſt be noted that the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp;
the peace of conſcience are thinges diuerſe,<note place="margin">A differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the conſcience and the peace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> and
that they haue diuerſe foundacions. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
(as hath bin already declared) is ruled by
the law, that is to ſay, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, &amp;
forbiddings of God. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of conſcience,
hath for his foundacion y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell,<note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt onely hath ſatisfied the iudgement of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes,
the grace of Ieſus Chriſt &amp; his righteouſnes.
And as there is no other meane to anſwere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

of Ieſus Chriſt: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo is it he alone which

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. For if we looke vnto our workes we
haue our conſciences ſtreighte way vexed &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
with feare &amp; diſtruſt of not hauing done
our deutie, in not obaying God, nor keeping of
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, as we were bound: which
was the cauſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> S. Paul ſayed,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 4.</note> that he felt him
ſelfe not culpable of any thing, but yet for this,
he thoughte him ſelfe not iuſtified: to giue vs to
vnderſtand: that there is nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can pacifie
our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only righteouſnes of Ieſus
Chriſt, &amp; not our own, which is alwaies imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
&amp; defiled with many filthes of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
&amp; by reaſon hereof cannot conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our hart,
nor make vs to take any pleaſure in many of
thoſe thinges we haue done or left vndone: but
the bloud, woundes &amp; death, and the ſide of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt opened (as S. Bernard ſayth) is
that, which pacifieth the conſcience, when as it
would thus torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; perſecute vs: Beholde the
freedom &amp; refuge we haue, where we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to ſauetie. To conclude then and here to
make an ende of this treatiſe, the righteouſnes
of Ieſus Chriſt, is the only meane, wherby we
are iuſtified before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, of the
lawe, of men, and of the conſcience.</p>
