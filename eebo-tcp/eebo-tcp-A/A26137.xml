         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
KINGS Grant of PRIVILEDGE
FOR
Sole Printing Common-Law-Books,
defended, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe principal Exception againſt the <hi>Grant
of Priviledge</hi> before mentioned is the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a <hi>Monopoly;</hi> And the principall
Foundation on which it ſtands ſupported
and juſtified is the <hi>Kings Prerogative;</hi> and therefore
thoſe two matters, <hi>A Monopoly</hi> and the nature
thereof; and the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> and the Extent
thereof are neceſſarily to be firſt conſidered.</p>
            <p>I conſider a <hi>Monopoly</hi> as it is (or was) at the
Common Law before the <hi>Stat. 21 Jac.</hi> the matter
in queſtion being of a <hi>Grant</hi> made <hi>before</hi> that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
and the thing granted <hi>Excepted</hi> out of that
Statute.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, A <hi>Monopoly</hi> is (as many other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
terms are) taken primarily and generally
in the worſt ſence, to ſignifie ſomething unlawful,
againſt the Freedome of Trade, the Liberty of the
Subject, &amp;c. And the word is thereupon alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and extended (beyond its literal ſignification)
to comprehend every ſole dealing or exerciſing of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47865:3"/>
that which others are reſtrained to uſe. And to be
termed a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> is at this day an imputation,
as if the unlawfulneſs thereof were neceſſarily to be
preſumed and implyed. Whereas it is moſt clear,
That <hi>All Monopolies are not againſt Law,</hi> ſome
being reaſonable, uſeful and beneficial to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and ſome neceſſary; and this Neceſſity and
Benefit to the People recompenceth the reſtraint
of their Liberty, and taketh away the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thereof. All <hi>Patents</hi> of Priviledge for the ſole
uſage of new inventions are <hi>Monopolies</hi> undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
yet is it <hi>neceſſary</hi> they ſhould be granted for
the encouragement of Induſtry and Invention;
The communicating whereof to publick uſe, is a
publick and general benefit, though the making the
Invention ſhould be perpetually appropriated to
the Inventor. All or moſt of the Ancient Offices
were at the firſt (and are agréed to be) direct and
<hi>plain Monopolies</hi> in their natures, and are now
found ſo to be in their miſchievous conſequence to
the generality of the people, whoſe charges do but
enr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch a ſingle perſon ſometimes for performing
that which is needleſs; or if needful, might be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the perſons concerned themſelves without
charge. Nevertheleſs, ſuch Offices having béen
created originally upon reaſon of <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> to
the Publick, for encouragement of Learning, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or Fidelity, or ſuch like Motives to His
Majeſties Royal Predeceſſors by whom they were
erected, have from Age to Age béen approved and
continued as they now are, (and are excepted by
name with this Priviledge in queſtion out of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47865:3"/>
aforeſaid Stat. 21 <hi>Jac.</hi>) as unqueſtionably law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>It hath been ſaid, That <hi>Ancient Offices are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and made Lawfull by Time and Cuſtome,
which is part of the LAW.</hi> To which I anſwer,
That a <hi>Monopoly</hi> is an Evill of that nature as
could not be juſtified by Cuſtome, or by length of
Time, if it were not <hi>ex rationabili cauſa uſitata,</hi> a
benefit to the People in recompence of the reſtraint
of their Freedoms: For 'tis the reaſonableneſs of
Benefit that juſtifies the thing, and not Time or
Cuſtome; <hi>In Conſuetudinibus conſideranda eſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas
rationis, non diuturnitas temporis.</hi> In like
manner a man may by Vſage or Reſervation claim
the <hi>Sole</hi> Priviledg of kéeping a common Mill, a
common Bake-houſe or Brew-houſe within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Precinct; For this may have commenced ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<hi>ex rationabili cauſa,</hi> by bargain or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be made at the Owners charge, and for the
Inhabitants eaſe and benefit, which is a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for the reſtraint of their liberty of uſing the
like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2 E. 3. 7.</hi> The Caſe there is, That the King had
granted a <hi>Charter</hi> of Priviledge to the Lord or
Owner of a <hi>Haven,</hi> that ſuch Ships as Anchored or
entred there for Harbour, ſhould unlade there only.
This and the precedent Caſes are plain <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi>
yet becauſe they ſtand upon equivalent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and the Ships had harbour and ſafety from the
Lord of the Haven, 'twas therefore allowed a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which Caſes I infer, That before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47865:4"/>
a <hi>Monopoly</hi> might be lawfully erected, becauſe
it might be beneficial to the Publick, and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in ſpecial Caſes. And with this agréeth the
Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 12. Parag. 16.</note>
               <hi>Monopolia non omnia cum jure naturae pugnant, nam
poſſunt interdum à ſumma poteſtate permitti juſta de
cauſa, &amp;c.</hi> And he inſtances the practice and permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereof in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, (the pattern of
Governments) and the Holy Story of <hi>Joſeph</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this matter. A <hi>Monopoly</hi> is then unlawful,
when thereby the People are reſtrained in their
Lawfull Trades, or in the exerciſe of what they
have right to uſe, without general benefit or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for the ſame: but the priviledging particular
perſons to exerciſe a particular Imployment which
others never did uſe, nor have right to uſe, and the
generall uſe whereof would be dangerous, and the
Reſtraint of the uſe ſafe for the Publick, cannot be
unlawful; for the reaſon of that unlawfulneſs fails,
<hi>ceſſante ratione Legis ceſſat Lex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Prerogative</hi> (which is a copious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
I ſhall only mention ſo much touching the
ſame, as I conceive moſt proper to the matter in
hand. The King hath <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of ſeverall
natures, and grounded upon ſeverall Reaſons;
Some in reſpect of his own Royal Eſtate and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
Others in reſpect of His Office and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for the better Government of his People: For
the King as Supream Magiſtrate hath a general
Truſt and Care of the Peoples ſafety, to <hi>prevent,</hi>
as well as to deliver from publick Evils.<note place="margin">Reg. 127.</note>

is (properly) <hi>futurorum;</hi> whereby the King
is to uſe all means to foreſée and prevent miſchiefs
within his Kingdom. For this purpoſe, and for the
enabling him to perform this Office and Truſt, he
is by Law endowed with ſeveral tranſcendent <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,</hi>
ſome <hi>known,</hi> and ſome <hi>unlimited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi>
which are <hi>jura ſummi Magiſtratus,</hi> as great
for weight, and as infinite for number as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
may be wherewith the Peoples ſafety
may be affected.</p>
            <p>The Extent of the Kings <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> ſuch as
concern their own perſonal rights, or the rights of
their Eſtate, are ſometimes diſputed, and have
ſometimes béen limited and reſtrained by their
own conſents in Parliament. But thoſe touching
the preſervation of the publick have never been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
nor ought to be diſputed or leſned; and if ſo,
the intended limitations and reſtraints thereof
have been adjudged void becauſe theſe <hi>Prerogatives</hi>
are inſeparable from the Crown.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, The King can diſpence with Laws,
can pardon offences, can licence matters prohibited,
can prohibit matters tolerated, and can priviledge,
reſtrain, or qualifie new accidents, as he in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Deliberation ſhall judge expedient and
beſt for the Publick good.<note place="margin">F. <hi>Paul Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vita</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Inqu. <hi>pag. 104.</hi>
               </note> Which Iudgment and
Deliberation is <hi>peculiar and proper to the KING,
who alone comprehendeth the Eſtate of publick
things,</hi> and it is a duty and conſequence of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magiſtracy. Now <hi>Printing</hi> in every mans
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47865:5"/>
reaſon and obſervation is, and in the Act for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<hi>Printing</hi> is prefaced to be matter of <hi>Publick
Care</hi> and <hi>great Concernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall only ſtate
the Caſe truly as it is to be underſtood touching the
<hi>Priviledge</hi> in queſtion, and then the Application will
be obvious.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Hen. 6.</hi> the <hi>Art of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
was firſt invented.<note place="margin">Anno 1466.</note> And as ſome <hi>Manuſcripts</hi>
relate,<note place="margin">This appears by a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Library at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
               </note> the ſame King <hi>Hen. 6.</hi> purchaſed the firſt
diſcovery of the Art, and thereby became Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
thereof at his own charge; Whereby the ſame
came to be taught and uſed in <hi>England,</hi> but for the
Printing of ſuch matters onely as the King <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
and <hi>Priviledged,</hi> and by the ſworn Servants of
the King onely, and in places appointed by the
King, and not elſewhere.</p>
            <p>By the later end of the Reign of <hi>H. 8.</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
was come to ſome perfection, and ſeveral
Books were then printed here <hi>cum Privilegio,</hi>
and Others brought over printed from beyond
the Seas; but being few in number, and the prices
thereof exceſſive, the ſame was remedied by the
<hi>Stat. 25 H. 8. cap. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The State at that time taking conſideration of
the growth of <hi>Printing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7 E. 6.</note> and the danger and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
that might enſue to the King and People
by <hi>Printing</hi> the <hi>Lawes of the Land,</hi> that thereby
Errors and Seditions might be divulged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated,
and other miſchiefs happen to affect the
the people, thought fit thereupon to commit the
<hi>Printing</hi> of the <hi>LAWES</hi> to the Care and Truſt of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47865:5"/>
ſome particular perſons whom the <hi>KING</hi> by <hi>Patent</hi>

            <p>Theſe Priviledges <hi>ad Imprimendum ſolum,</hi> have
continually béen enjoyed according to the purport
of the ſaid Grants; ſaving the interruption forced
upon the Preſſe after 1642. in the times of the
late Troubles, whereby Sedition and Treaſon
came to be printed openly, and continued ſo to be
till His Majeſties Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47865:6"/>
This is the firſt peaceable Age wherein the
Kings <hi>Prerogative,</hi> in this matter of Printing the
<hi>LAWES,</hi> was ever queſtioned, or the aforeſaid
<hi>Priviledges</hi> charged with the imputation of <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies.</hi>
And whether they be <hi>Such Monopolies</hi> as
are againſt Law, is the preſent queſtion.</p>
            <p>For the juſtifying the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I offer the Reaſons enſuing.</p>
            <p>1. That the King hath as abſolute Power to
prevent Evils foreſeen, as He hath to reform them
which happen unforeſeen. And I conceive it clear,
as He may forbid the exerciſe of any Invention,
which upon the Permiſſion thereof ſhall prove or
become a Nuſance, or common miſchief, So He
may qualifie, or wholly prohibit the firſt uſe of it,
out of a proſpect of the miſchief. Watchfulneſs
and Carefulneſs are the Duties required of a good
Prince; to watch, is, that He may prevent and
obviate Dangers. Now experience hath diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us the Dangers and Miſchiefs of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Printing; And, though the excellency of
the Invention cannot be denyed, yet, whoever will
conſider it, ſhall find, that Factions and Errors in
matters of Religion, and principles of Treaſon
and Rebellions in matters of State have been
more inſinuated and fomented by the Liberty of
the Preſſe, then by any other ſingle means. So it
may ſeem a queſtion (impartially conſidered) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>the Uſe of Printing</hi> recompenceth the miſchief
by the <hi>liberty and abuſe</hi> thereof. Therefore the
<note n="a" place="margin">F. <hi>Paul</hi> Servita ubi ſupra, Pag. 106, 107.</note> 
               <hi>Father</hi> obſerveth excellently well, <hi>The matter of
Books ſeemeth to be a thing of ſmall moment, becauſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47865:6"/>
it treats of words; but through theſe words, come
Opinions into the World, which cauſe Partialities,
Seditions, and Wars: They are words, it is true, but
ſuch as in conſequence, draw after them Hoſts of
Armed Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now certainly, had the King at the firſt diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Invention of Printing, foreſéen the Vſe
thereof a likely means of Diſturbance to the peace
of the Church or State (as the liberty and abuſe
thereof hath proved to both). It had béen in the
Kings power, for the Peace and Safety of both, to
have prohibited the Vſe of Printing wholly.</p>
            <p>2. As upon the Reaſon aforeſaid, the King might
at the firſt have refuſed to have received the Vſe of
Printing at all into His Dominions, ſo much more
reaſonably might He reſtrain the general Liberty
and Vſe thereof, not to extend to matters of State
or Law, theſe being peculiarly within His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and of more apparent danger to the peace
of the State. Some States have not ſuffered
their Laws at all to be publiſhed or known. There
might be policy in this, though it ſeems unjuſt; yet
on the contrary, for a general Liberty to publiſh
the Laws is neither honourable nor ſafe. The
mean betwixt theſe extreams hath been practiſed
by the Kings of this Realm, not to Reſtrain the
printing of the Laws wholly (as They might have
done) nor yet to give a General Liberty to every
man for the doing thereof (which might prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe)
but to <hi>Priviledge Select Perſons only</hi> to do the
ſame, who might be anſwerable for Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and Defects therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47865:7"/>
3. Though the Art of Printing was diſcovered
ſometime before the Reign of <hi>E. 6.</hi> from whom the
firſt Patent of <hi>this Priviledge</hi> appears Granted,
yet were the preſſes all then Licenced by the
King; And none, or no conſiderable Book of the
Law was printed before that time, the Art not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to perfection: So that the <hi>firſt</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this priviledge could <hi>not</hi> be pretended <hi>a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly,</hi>
or illegal, none then having the Trade, or
Right of printing the Laws to be detrimented
thereby.</p>
            <p>4. The King having at the firſt beginning of
Printing, by His lawful Prerogative, and upon
juſt Reaſon placed this Priviledge of printing the
Laws ſolely in the hands of particular perſons, to
prevent miſchiefs which might enſue upon a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
liberty given to print the Laws; and the ſaid
Priviledge being then not unlawful, becauſe no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of any thing then practiſed or exerciſed,
or which any one had right to exerciſe: and
having ever ſince ſo continued, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
generally neither intitled to the Right or Vſage
of printing the Laws, remains grantable as at the
firſt by Virtue of the ſame Prerogative, and for
the ſame ends, and with the ſame innocence from
injuring any one.</p>
            <p>5. Beſides the Reaſons before mentioned, (of
ſecurity to the Kingdome, againſt Innovations,
or falſe conſtruction of the Laws, either by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of Authors, or miſtake of Printers, which is
worthy the Princes Care, and thoſe He entruſts
with the printing of the Laws to prevent) the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47865:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King hath (as I conceive) <hi>a peculiar Right and
Property</hi> (not only in the Art and Invention of
printing by purchaſe (as before hath been ſaid) for in
that I lay no great weight but) <hi>in the Laws</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and in the <hi>publiſhing</hi> thereof, which cannot
be taken from Him, or aſſumed by any Subject
without His leave. 'Tis true, the people have alſo
a Right in the Laws (as they had before Printing
was known) not to print them, but to receive the
fruit of them from the Kings Hand. But the King
is the Repoſitory and Proprietor, and is entruſted
with the Promulgation and Execution of the
Laws.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>Lex ſcripta &amp; non ſcripta.</hi> The writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Laws are Records, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are <hi>Recorda &amp;
Brevia Domini Regis,</hi> and are reckoned <hi>inter Theſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria
Regis,</hi> as the chief and principal things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath property. But the unwritten Laws,
which are grounded upon Cuſtom and Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
are yet more properly the Kings then the other, for
theſe are in his Breſt. The written Law is repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
but <hi>in Arca</hi> or <hi>Theſauro Regis,</hi> but the Laws
unwritten are <hi>in pectore Regis. In ſcrinio pectoris,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Forteſcue.</hi> From whence I infer, That theſe
Laws and Records which are ſo peculiarly the
Kings in property and diſpenſation, ought not to
be publiſhed, or numbred, or interpreted but by
Authority from Him; and the printing thereof is of
the Kings free pleaſure, and not the peoples Right,
and conſequently the priviledging ſome to print the
Law is the Kings Grace, and the reſtraining others
from that Liberty not any wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47865:8"/>
6. If no material Reaſon could be offered in
this Caſe, to aſſert the Kings Right in Granting
this Priviledge, yet there want not Authorities to
juſtify the ſame.</p>
            <p>1. The conſtant <hi>uſage</hi> and practiſe, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
from the firſt ſettlement of Printing, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the ſucceſſion of Patents before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>In the Argument of <hi>Darcy and Allens Caſe,</hi> One
great Reaſon againſt that Patent,<note place="margin">44 Eliz.</note> was, That the
like had never been granted before. But here the
like hath ever béen granted, ever ſince the printing
of the Laws, and the like (or any) Exception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
never heard of before.</p>
            <p>2. The general <hi>Allowance of the Judges</hi> in the
Argument of <hi>Darcy and Allens Caſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moores Rep. 673.</note> where this
Patent was cited as a preſident, and holden lawful,
<hi>&amp; neceſſary pur le peace &amp; ſafety del Realm, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
contradicente.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Stat. 21 Jac. cap 3.</hi> was paſſed purpoſely
to ſuppreſſe the then preſent, and to prevent the
future granting of <hi>Monopolies,</hi> and yet expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
Patents of priviledge for ſole printing of
Books with ſeveral branches of the Militia and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and other like things of the higheſt concern to
the Crown. And I cannot omit to obſerve, That
this priviledge of printing is the firſt thing named in
the Exception, as if the Parliament then had it firſt
and principally in their Care; And that this Patent
now in queſtion was the ſame Patent then in
force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47865:8"/>
4. The <hi>Stat. 21. Jac.</hi> before mentioned, and alſo
the <hi>Stat. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Car. 2.</hi> touching the Regulation of
printing, provide for <hi>Patents of Priviledge</hi> for print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Granted, or to be granted;</hi> which they would
not have done, had they not approved and intended
to encourage like Grants to be made. And alſo the
laſt mentioned <hi>Stat. fol. 433.</hi> expreſly prohibits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
penalties <hi>printing</hi> or <hi>com-printing</hi> of ſuch Books,
the which any other hath ſole priviledge to print by
Letters Patents; which implies, the Parliament
intended to ſupport and eſtabliſh ſuch as lawfull;
and it cannot be reaſonably thought ſeveral Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhould ſo expreſly provide for this priviledge
of ſole Printing, if they had not deſigned to ſecure
it from the Cenſure of a Monopoly.</p>
            <p>It hath been Objected,<note place="margin">1. Object.</note> That this Patent hath
the miſchiefs of a Monopoly, for thereby the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
may enhaunce the prices of Law-Books; May
print the Law-Books as defectively as he pleaſes,
and may priſe mens Labours at his own Rates,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The prices of Books may (if occaſion ſhall be)
be regulated by the Chancellor,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. per Stat. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> H.
8. cap. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Defective printing, or other abuſes in or about
the printing of the Laws, is a breach of Truſt, and
puniſhable in the Patentée, and a cauſe of forfeiture
of his Patent, as miſ-execution, or defective erecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a cauſe of forfeiture of an Office.</p>
            <p>3. If theſe Objections were true, and could receive
no Anſwer, the miſchiefs pretended are not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the benefits received, or the ſecurity which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47865:9"/>
redounds to the Publick, by reſtraining the general
Liberty of printing the Laws.</p>
            <p>The words of the Patent are ſaid to be too large
and unreaſonable,<note place="margin">2. Object.</note> to priviledge <hi>all Books concerning</hi>
the Common Laws. For herein all manner of
Books whatever are included, foraſmuch as every
Book more or leſs compriſeth ſomething of the
Common-Law.</p>
            <p>This is an <hi>unreaſonable conſtruction</hi> of the
words;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for Books principally treating of another
Subject, which in the proof, or proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
only mention ſome Maxims or principles of
the Law, can only be ſaid to contain in them ſome
Chapter or Page (but cannot be termed Books)
concerning the Law, the Law neither being their

            </p>
            <p>7. If this Patent touching the ſole printing of
the Laws ſhould in this Age have the ſentence of
a Monopoly againſt Law, in conſequence other
Patents of priviledge of like nature for ſole print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Books (that is to ſay) the Patents to the
Kings Printers for printing Proclamations. The
Patents for printing the Bible, Teſtament, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,
<hi>&amp;c. The</hi> Patents <hi>of both the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities</hi>
of this Kingdom in reference to Printing.</hi> The
ſeveral Patents to the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Stationers</hi> for
ſole printing the <hi>Primer, Pſalters, Singing Pſalms,
School-Books;</hi> and that of <hi>Almanacks,</hi> the words
of which are, <hi>All and all manner of Almanacks, <hi>In

            <p>8. The uſage of other Neighbour Kingdomes

of the like Vſage here. In <hi>France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,

are uſually granted, and ſolemnly obſerved. The

            <p>Now foraſmuch as the Kings of this Realm of

might ſo be) by any Statute ſince the Invention of
printing, why ſhould They be conceived to have leſs

for a Prince to rule the ſpirits and wills of his
Subjects (ſince Printing came in Vſe) without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
the Preſſe, which ſo evidently influences
them to Evil or Good. I only add, That after the

immediately found it neceſſary again to Reſtrain
the ſame <hi>(Anno 1643.)</hi> for their own Security.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all which is,</p>
            <p>1. That ſome <hi>Monopolies</hi> may be neceſſary and
uſeful to the Publick, and conſequently lawful,</p>
            <p>2. That the King hath <hi>Prerogative</hi> to priviledge

ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Edw. 6.</hi>

Patents</hi> of the ſame priviledge ever ſince the printing
of the Laws.</p>
            <p>5. That experience hath diſcovered the <hi>Miſchief</hi>
of Liberty in printing the Laws.</p>
            <p>6. That the King upon <hi>fore-ſight</hi> hereof (much
more upon experience) might Reſtrain the printing
of the Laws wholly.</p>
            <p>7. That the King hath a <hi>Property</hi> in the Laws,
and 'tis His <hi>Grace,</hi> and not the peoples <hi>Right,</hi> to
have them printed.</p>
            <p>8. That like priviledges for ſole printing of

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47865:10"/>
the Neighbour Princes and States where printing
