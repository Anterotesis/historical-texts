            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS OF Preſent Uſe, CONCERNING The Danger Reſulting from the CHANGE OF OUR CHURCH-GOVERNMENT.</head>
            <p>TO him that being ſatisfied in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> doth yet conceive that the parting with it is no <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and conſequently, that the ſtanding for it at this time, when it is oppoſed, is but the preferring the intereſts of ſome inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable men before the conveniences and common Wiſhes of all, I earneſtly deſire (in the Bowels of Compaſſion to my bleeding Country, and from a ſincere Paſſionate wiſh that the <hi>cure</hi> of this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52150:3"/>
wound may not be an <hi>imperfect cure</hi>) to preſent ſome few ſad conſiderations, which I ſhall caſt under two heads (proportionable to the two parts of the former ungrounded ſuggeſtion) the one, <hi>That parting with the preſent Government is no change of Religion</hi>; the other, <hi>That ſtanding for it at this time, is the preferring the intereſts of ſome before the common wiſh of all,</hi> the peace of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Concerning the former, I offer to conſideration, Firſt, whether the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church be not a conſiderable part of <hi>Religion?</hi> That it is ſo, I ſhall make appear by theſe Reaſons. 1. That <hi>Government</hi> is as neceſſary to the <hi>preſervation</hi> of the Church as <hi>Preaching</hi> the Goſpel was to the <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, and that therefore it was always the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practice, as ſoon as ever they had converted a City or Province, or any conſiderable number of Men in it, to leave it in the hands of ſome faithful Perſons, to <hi>dreſs, tend,</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> what they had thus <hi>planted</hi>; and therefore though it were <hi>poſſible</hi> for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to be deprived of this benefit, and yet to remain <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (as to <hi>want</hi> ſome limbs, or to <hi>abound</hi> to monſtroſity in others, is yet recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with <hi>life</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of a Man) to retain the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Chriſtianity without any <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to be a Chriſtian in the Wall or in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, a <hi>Stylita</hi> or <hi>Anachorite</hi> Chriſtian (in which caſe there is no doubt the <hi>uſe</hi> of the very <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf, would not be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52150:3"/>
               <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) yet would it be little leſs than fury for any to deſign or hope the <hi>proſperity</hi> or <hi>duration</hi> of a Church, or viſible ſociety of ſuch Chriſtians, without this grand <hi>neceſſary</hi> (though not of <hi>ſingle being,</hi> yet) of <hi>mutual preſervation,</hi> this <hi>principle</hi> not of <hi>eſſence</hi> but of <hi>continuance,</hi> without which (it is the learned <hi>Breerewood</hi>'s obſervation from St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) that the preſervation of a <hi>Church</hi> was once by <hi>experience</hi> found to be an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi> thing, no other engine being able to repair the Want or Supply the <hi>place</hi> of that.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon may be drawn from the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>pleas</hi> of all the moſt diſtant <hi>pretenders</hi> for the ſeveral Forms of Government in the <hi>Church,</hi> as well thoſe that have eſpouſed the <hi>Papal,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterial,</hi> the <hi>Independent,</hi> as thoſe which are for the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Form by <hi>the King and his Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> all vehemently contending for the neceſſity of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which they affect in the Church, and none ſo calm or modeſt in their claims, as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of the Engliſh Prelacy; which moderation or want of heat, is ſure one reaſon that ſo many Sons of this Church are now tempted to think Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo <hi>unconſiderable</hi> a thing, and ſo <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to Chriſtianity; though this thought thus ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be a double injuſtice, 1. In ſuſpecting that <hi>truth,</hi> for want of <hi>aſſerting,</hi> which is therefore not ſo vehemently <hi>aſſerted,</hi> becauſe it is ſuppoſed <hi>truth,</hi> 2. In encouraging <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of diſputes (the greateſt plague in a Church) by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52150:4"/>
ſhewing them that the <hi>Eagereſt</hi> pretenders ſhall be moſt <hi>heeded,</hi> and that <hi>meekneſs ſhall not inherit the earth,</hi> though both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed it ſhould. A third argument may be had from the judgment of our <hi>State,</hi> which hath thought fit to make the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church matter of one of the <hi>Articles of our Religion,</hi> and ſo to joyn in honour the care of it with the care of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and to require as ſtrict a <hi>ſubſcription</hi> to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh't <hi>Government,</hi> as to the reſt of the 39. heads of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by which you may evidently ſee, that to change the <hi>Government</hi> is to change the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and where Doctrine and Government both are changed, can we poſſibly think the Religion to be the ſame? I ſhall add no more <hi>Proofs</hi> of this, becauſe I conceive them <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>; the contrary miſapprehenſion being, as I ſuppoſe, not grounded by <hi>Arguments,</hi> but of its own accord ariſing from an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>an experiment,</hi> which many men, eſpecially <hi>perſons of quality,</hi> think they have made, that in their whole lives they never reaped any benefit from <hi>Government,</hi> never received any acceſſion or encreaſe to their ſpiritual weal from that, as from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church, they acknowledg to have done. To this ground of miſpriſion, as being perhaps the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the cauſe of the whole miſtake, it will not be amiſs to make ſome anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That many benefits we receive from <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52150:4"/>
which we do not <hi>viſibly diſcern,</hi> and that therefore, when we <hi>diſcern</hi> our ſelves to have received ſome growth, and cannot but know that it was wrought by <hi>means,</hi> we ſhould rather confeſs our want of <hi>ſenſe</hi> or gratitude to the <hi>true means,</hi> than imagine thoſe not to have been the <hi>means,</hi> only becauſe we have not that <hi>ſenſe</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe means which have been more <hi>viſible</hi> to us, the diſpenſation of the Word and Sacraments, have been reacht out to us by the hand of <hi>Government,</hi> to which therefore we owe our acknowledgments in the ſecond place for our <hi>preſervation</hi> and <hi>growth,</hi> as to the hand of ſupreme previdence for our <hi>being</hi> or <hi>life</hi> ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if the <hi>benefits of Government</hi> have not been really very <hi>diſcernable</hi> and <hi>notable</hi> to all, that is not yet in any juſtice to be imputed to any <hi>defect</hi> that way in Government it ſelf, to any <hi>barrennes</hi> in the nature or particular temper of it, but to ſome <hi>default</hi> (which will deſerve ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and reforming) in the <hi>Perſons,</hi> either of the <hi>Rulers,</hi> or of <hi>thoſe</hi> which are <hi>under rule,</hi> or of a third ſort whoſe dutie it is to be the Rulers <hi>Perſpectives</hi> and <hi>Otacouſticks,</hi> to preſent to their knowledg, the wants of inferiours, which till they are <hi>known,</hi> are not likely to be <hi>repaired.</hi> The defaults in each of theſe ſeverals are, or may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52150:5"/>
be ſo many, and ſo obnoxious to common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that it will be much more reaſonable for each to reſolve to <hi>amend</hi> his part for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo make it a buſineſs of <hi>Reformation,</hi> than to charge the defaults of Perſons to the defaming of Government, and ſo to <hi>undervalue</hi> and <hi>ſcorn</hi> what our ſins firſt, then our phanſies have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The comfort is, that it hath been the <hi>clemency</hi> as well as the <hi>ſloth</hi> or <hi>cowardice</hi> of Governours, which have deprived men of the great fruits of Government; and if it may be agreed that it is very expedient, and will be taken in good part, that Governours hereafter be more <hi>ſevere,</hi> as well as more <hi>diligent,</hi> more <hi>couragious,</hi> as well as more <hi>laborious,</hi> in uſing the <hi>Weapons of their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> to <hi>cut</hi> off or to <hi>cure,</hi> without any reſpect of perſons, whereſoever there is need of them; I ſhall hope this objection will <hi>then</hi> be throughly Anſwered, if as <hi>yet</hi> it be not.</p>
            <p>A ſecond conſideration apportioned to the former head will be this, whether (ſuppoſing Government of the Church to be a conſiderable part of Religion) the change of it from Eſtabliſhed Epiſcopacy to any other (namely to that of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> by many, without any <hi>Superiour</hi> over them, or as that is oppoſite to <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>) be not a ſin againſt <hi>Religion?</hi> That it is, or will be ſo, I ſhall endeavour to convince the <hi>gainſayer</hi> by theſe ſteps
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52150:5"/>
or degrees of proof, which though perhaps not each ſingle, yet all being put together will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, where <hi>prejudice</hi> doth not hinder, be ſufficient to doe it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this Government by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> is of <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitution.</hi> But this being an affirmation, as demonſtrable by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Records, as any thing can be, or as the Canon of Scripture which we receive, is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be the Canon of Scripture; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it hath by others been ſufficiently proved, I ſhall therefore wholly ſpare the repeating of that trouble, and add unto it. 2. That it hath the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> though not the diſtinct precept of Chriſt, who with his twelve <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the many other <hi>Diſciples</hi> in time of his reſidence upon Earth, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour one to the other, are the copy, of which the <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> in the following Age, were a tranſcript, who are therefore by St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> S. <hi>Johns Contemporary,</hi> allowed to receive honour, <hi>the Biſhops</hi> as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Deacons</hi> as the <hi>Seventy.</hi> 3. That as far as concerns <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of one order to the other (which is ſufficient to eject the Presbytery which ſuppoſes an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>equality</hi> of all) it is Authorized by ſacred Scripture-practiſe, where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</note> that when <hi>Judas</hi> fell from his orbe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>dignity</hi> of being one of the Twelve, is by the direction of the Spirit, and by lot beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Matthias,</hi> who, though before a Diſciple of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52150:6"/>
Chriſt, was not till then aſſumed to that <hi>dignity.</hi> Fourthly, that ſuppoſing it to be in this manner <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> there is little colour of reaſon to doubt, but that the preſerving of it is of as great moment as many <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Chriſtianity, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many <hi>doctrines</hi> were not ſo <hi>explicitely</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Chriſt, but that they needed farther <hi>explicating</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (and are therefore by the Church grounded not in any words of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but in the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) but alſo becauſe it was in Gods <hi>providence</hi> thought fit, that <hi>Government</hi> ſhould be ſetled not by <hi>Chriſt perſonally,</hi> but by the Apoſtles, that is <hi>mediately</hi> by Chriſt; as doctrine was by Chriſt <hi>immediately.</hi> Chriſt in his life time gives them the ground of a Church, divine truth, the <hi>word of his Father,</hi> the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of which is <hi>the rock on which his Church is built,</hi> on this the Apoſtles are to build, and gather members, and to ſettle the whole edifice <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>to the end of the world.</hi> And <hi>Government</hi> being neceſſary to the ſetling, was undoubtedly thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and left to them by CHRIST, and ſo their Authority in inſtituting that which they inſtituted, as evidently deduced from CHRIST, as their power of <hi>Preaching</hi> what they preached, or <hi>baptiſing</hi> whom they baptiſed. And having gone thus far, I cannot but reſume my <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52150:6"/>
thus far made more <hi>conſiderable,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any ſober conſcience, whether it be not ſome irreligion thus to diſplace or remove that which the Apoſtles (to whom only by Chriſt it was intruſted) according to Chriſts own Samplar and Scripture-grounds, thought fit to ſettle in the Church, ſuppoſing it to be a matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is ſpoken of, as before we proved; nay, whether if an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> were to be <hi>anathematized for teaching any other Doctrine than what</hi> one Apoſtle had taught, it would not be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of juſt <hi>terrour</hi> to any that ſhould have any part in the guilt of inſtituting any other Government than that which the Appoſtles had inſtituted, eſpecially when the acts of <hi>Councels</hi> tell us, that what S. <hi>Paul</hi> denounces againſt the <hi>heterodox</hi> Angel, the Church did practiſe againſt <hi>Aerius,</hi> anathematized him for impugning this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which now we ſpeak of. And if ſtill the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of all this be blemiſht by this one <hi>exception,</hi> that this inſtitution af the Appoſtles is not affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or there commanded to poſterity to <hi>continue,</hi> and retain for ever.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, by ſaying that which may be a fourth Argument to prove the irreligiouſneſs of ſuch change, That there is as much or more to be ſaid (in both thoſe reſpects, both for <hi>mention</hi> of this <hi>inſtitution in Scripture,</hi> and for <hi>Apoſtolical precept for continuing</hi> of it) for this <hi>Government,</hi> as for ſome other things whoſe chang would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52150:7"/>
very irreligious. I will only inſtance in one, the Inſtitution of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> of which there is nothing can be ſaid to the ſetting up the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> of it, which will not be ſaid of <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> A <hi>ground</hi> of it there was <hi>in nature,</hi> ſome <hi>Time</hi> to be ſet a part to the ſpecial publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; and the like <hi>ground</hi> there <hi>is in nature</hi> for this, that ſome <hi>Perſons</hi> ſhould be deſigned to, and rewarded for the ſpecial publick ſervice of God. A <hi>pattern</hi> of that there was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> one day in the ſeven deſigned for Gods <hi>Quotum</hi> or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the like <hi>pattern</hi> there is among the <hi>Jews</hi> for this; a Government by <hi>High-Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> That was an Inſtitution not of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his life time immediately, but of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> after his departure inveſted with ſuch power; the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution there is of this by the ſame <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after Chriſts Aſcenſion, directed and aſſiſted by the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>occaſion</hi> of pitching on the firſt day of the week was a ſolemn action of Chriſt his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> on that day; the <hi>occaſion</hi> of this, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſtinct orders in the Church in Chriſts time, <hi>Chriſts Apoſtles, Diſciples,</hi> and the manifeſt ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of him before all of them (who affirms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their <hi>Lord,</hi> even when he ſpeaks of his office Miniſterial, his <hi>coming to Miniſter to them</hi>) and of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> before the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as even now was ſhewed. The mention of that was found once in the <hi>Revelation</hi> diſtinctly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Lords day,</hi> and twice or thrice in equipollent terms, <hi>the firſt day of the week</hi>; and the mention of Epiſcopacy is as clear,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52150:7"/>
               <hi>the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> (which hath been cleared by irrefragable evidence to belong to this matter) and the <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> in <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that muſt have <hi>double honour,</hi> and <hi>Titus left in Crete to ſet in order the things that were wanting, and to ordain Elders in every Church</hi>; and many other more clear mentions of the ſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral titles and officies of <hi>Biſhop, Preſhyter,</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> than there is of the name and duties of the <hi>Lords day.</hi> The <hi>obſcure mentions</hi> of that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were <hi>explained</hi> in the writings and Stories of the firſt age of the Church, particularly in the <hi>Epiſtiles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the <hi>obſcurities</hi> of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Texts concerning <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> are as clearly <hi>explicated</hi> and unfolded by the ſame <hi>Ignatius</hi> even in every one of thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of his which <hi>Vedelius</hi> (as great an enemy of this Order as <hi>Geneva</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced any) after his <hi>fiery tryal</hi> of that Author hath acknowledged to be his. <hi>The uſe</hi> of that continued from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time (though not univerſally till the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath</hi> was fairly laid a ſleep) till theſe days in the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> and all <hi>perticular Churches,</hi> that we read of; and the like uſe and practiſe of this continued <hi>univerſall</hi> without any exception from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, till this day in the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> as that ſignifies the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, and in each particular Church, till about this laſt <hi>Century,</hi> and in this of ours from the plantation of the Goſpel till this day. Theſe are paralleſs enough to even the ballance (and I profeſs to know no one more which might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52150:8"/>
weigh it down on that ſide) and to make it now ſeaſonable to demand, whether it would not be thought an act contrary to Religion (whether that ſignifies Chriſtian <hi>Piety,</hi> or <hi>meekneſs,</hi> or <hi>awe,</hi> to all that is <hi>Sacred</hi>) for any particular National Church or part thereof, without any more warrant then is now offered for this preſent change, to remove the ſervice of God from the <hi>Lords day</hi> to any other day in the week, (which ſure is as ſmall a differnce, as that betwixt <hi>Presbyterial</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government can by any be conceived to be) or inſtead of our <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week to ſet apart either an <hi>eight,</hi> or a <hi>ſixt</hi> day, and ſo to change that <hi>Apoſtolical inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> If <hi>that</hi> ſeem ſtrange, or be ſtartled at, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be ventured on, or yielded to, I ſhall deſire the ſame plea may be entred for <hi>this,</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be ſecured, that either both are lawfull, or that the difference is clear, and the advantage on the <hi>Lords days</hi> ſide, or that it may be reſolved that <hi>this</hi> is unlawfull as well as <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fift Argument will be this, That the making (or yielding to) this change, will be a ſcandal (very worthy to be conſidered) in them that ſo <hi>yield,</hi> toward thoſe which <hi>oppoſe</hi> this Government as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; for this yielding will be an appearing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, that their contrary Pretentions are true, and ſo a confirming them in their <hi>errour</hi> (which is no light one, but the ſame for which <hi>Aerius</hi> was, and any other appoſer would certainly have been anathematized, and turned out of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52150:8"/>
               <hi>Catholick</hi> Church for an <hi>Heretick,</hi>) which is one ſpecial kind of <hi>Scandalizing</hi> or occaſioning the fall of our Brethren, and withall a nouriſhing them in their <hi>uncharitable opinion</hi> not only of us, but of the ancient Fathers of the Church, (who were all <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> if this be ſo) which is another <hi>cauſing my Brother to offend</hi>: nay a kind of countenancing that <hi>unchriſtian</hi> (am ſure <hi>unproteſtant) Doctrine,</hi> of the lawfulneſs of <hi>taking up Arms,</hi> againſt lawfull Superiours and Eſtabliſht Lawes, and propagating our opinions in Religion by that means, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſome may be betrayed to by this <hi>example,</hi> others brought to believe conſentaneous to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine,</hi> if they which are thus guilty be thus gratified; which as it were a <hi>change</hi> in our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> if it were <hi>really acknowledged,</hi> ſo is it, in this reſpect, another act of <hi>Scandall,</hi> if it thus <hi>aprear</hi> to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,</hi> and that which would make any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Prince unwilling to embrace our Religion, if this diſloyal perſwaſion were conceived to be a part of it.</p>
            <p>A ſixt Argument (which to me is of no ſmall force) I will yet but name, and refer it to others to conſider of, That no man is a Prieſt, or lawfully ordained Miniſter of any Chriſtian Church, but he that is <hi>called</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God</hi>; that there is now no way in this Kingdome, to have that <hi>calling</hi> or <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> duly but from <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who are the only perſons who have their power of Ordaining others, <hi>given</hi> to them in their aſſumption to that Order by thoſe who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52150:9"/>
had it before, and can drive it from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who had it <hi>immediatly</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi>: and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other power a <hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Preſhyter</hi> may be thought or ſaid to have common with a Biſhop, it is yet the conſtant judgment of the univerſal Church for 1500, years, that this of Ordination is not competible to one or more <hi>bare Presbyters</hi> without a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and it will be eaſie to ſatisfie any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man in whatſoever may be produced of ſound, or probability to the contrary: and therefore if any Office, or Order, or Miniſtry in the Church be conſiderable, this which is the ſtanding well-head and ſpring of all the other, muſt be thought ſo alſo.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe Arguments of ſo much weight, ſufficient to ſupport the burthen deſigned to them, I ſhall add, <hi>ex abundante</hi> ſome inferior ones (though they amount not ſo far, as alone of themſelves to conclude it direct irreligion, yet to add to the former heap ſome aggravations. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That to yield to this change, is to <hi>diſclaim</hi> thoſe bleſſed means of Gods <hi>providence</hi> which brought us to our Baptiſme, to all our ſpiritual life and growth that we have attained to, and that is a great ingratitude to that Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an act of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>inſolency,</hi> to prefer any ſcheme of <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>modern</hi> invention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Primitive,</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52150:9"/>
(for ſo many years) the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> had authorized, and therefore I could almoſt adventure to believe, that the framers of the <hi>Covenant</hi> had obliged themſelves ſecretly to maintain Epiſcopacy by putting in thoſe words, [<hi>the beſt Reformed Churches</hi>] that I might eſcape thinking them ſo <hi>inſolent</hi> as to prefer any Churches before thoſe, which they cannot but know have uſed <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It ia a great <hi>tempting of Gods providence,</hi> in not being contented with that Form which hath proſpered ſo happily with us, and the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, (though ſubject (as all that is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or mixt with fleſh, is even the very grace of God in us) to be abuſed) any putting it to the adventure, whatſoever inconveniences the next may be ſubject to. Of the <hi>inconveniences</hi> that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery doth infallibly bring along with it, and the <hi>unreconcilableneſs</hi> of them with <hi>Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in the State, ſufficient evidences have been given; and if there were no other but this, that the endeavouring to bring it in at this time hath brought this tempeſt and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> upon this Kingdom, and that this hath been but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſequent of that Government, whereſoever it hath but begun to heave, caſting out Peace, and obedience to lawful Authority together, it would well deſerve to have this mark of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or non-election ſet upon it, if it were but for this, that the proſperity of ſuch attempts ſhould not encourage others to the like. This and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52150:10"/>
the like inconveniences are of ſuch weight, that for men to be willing to exchange the <hi>certain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the one, for the <hi>uncertain</hi> advantages and ſtrongly probable calamities of the other is a ſin, that may <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>tempt</hi> God to puniſh them yet further with greater and unexpected curſes, and therefore may deſerve in 'its place to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an act of <hi>infidelity</hi> and practical <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſme</hi> for thoſe eſpecially who being convinced with the former reaſons to acknowledg any irreligion or ſin in ſuch change) to ſacrifice any thing to our own preſent conveniences, to make any change in ſacred matters meerly out of intuition of our own ſecular advantages; <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> in thinking that God cannot as eaſily blaſt that convenience ſo acquired, as thoſe many which came more directly to our hands; and <hi>infidelity,</hi> or <hi>diſtruſt,</hi> in thinking that God will not in his time give thoſe conveniences and advantages (if they be ſuch indeed) by means perfectly <hi>lawful,</hi> which now we covet by <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> To which might be added the wants and omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions of thoſe duties of <hi>confeſſion of Chriſt,</hi> in not defending and ſtanding to thoſe truths which we are convinced to be ſuch, in time of their being oppugned and perſecuted; <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> in not depoſiting our own carnal ſecular aims and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and <hi>of taking up the Croſs,</hi> in not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willingly and cheerfully when it lies in our way to the preforming of any act of obedence

to Chriſt. But I would not inlarge to theſe, but <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly conclude this proof with a fift <hi>difficulty</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating <hi>ſin</hi> from <hi>changes,</hi> when they are great, and in matters of weight: It is the wiſe mans advice that occaſioned this obſervation, <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them which are given to changes:</hi> The changes are ſure changes in Government, and thoſe are named in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, without any <hi>reſtraint,</hi> and the very <hi>med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> with them <hi>that are inclined</hi> to ſuch, is oppoſed both to Piety and Loyalty, <hi>Fearing of God and the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the conſiderations proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the firſt part of the ſuggeſtion. I proceed to the view of the ſecond part of it, and there the conſideration ſhall be only this, whether,</p>
            <p>The change of this Government, be not a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of all,</hi> as well as of thoſe who are <hi>now Clergy-men.</hi> That it is ſo, may appear probable, becauſe the <hi>revenue or honours</hi> which belong to them in Government are not the ſole, or main part of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venrment</hi>; there is a <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> which our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers thought worthy to be <hi>encouraged</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded</hi> with thoſe payments, and if any man ſhall think them ill proportioned, I ſhall not doubt to tell him S. <hi>Chriſoſtomes</hi> judgment, <hi>that the burthen of a Biſhop was formidable, even to an Angell to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo,</hi> and if the corruptions of latter times be affirmed to have changed that ſtate of things, I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52150:11"/>
anſwer: that the reſtoring Epiſcopacy to its due <hi>burthen</hi> as well as <hi>reputation,</hi> were a care worthy of reformers, and it is ſo far from my deſire that any ſuch care ſhould be ſpared, that it is now my publick ſolemn Petition both to God and Man, that the <hi>power of the keys,</hi> and the exerciſe of that power, the due uſe of <hi>confirmation,</hi> and (previous to that) examination, and tryall of youth, a ſtrict ſearch into the manners and tempers, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of thoſe that are to be admitted into holy <hi>Orders,</hi> and to be licentiate for <hi>publick Preachers,</hi> the <hi>viſitation</hi> of each Pariſh in each Dioceſs, and the exerciſe of Church-diſcipline upon all offenders; together with <hi>painfull,</hi> mature and ſober <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Catechizing,</hi> ſtudies of all kinds, and parts of Theological Learning, Languages, Controverſies, Writings of the Schools and Caſuiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ſo far taken into conſideration by our Law-makers and ſo far conſidered in the collating of Church-preferments and dignities, ſo much of Duty required of Clergie-men, and ſo little left <hi>arbitrary</hi> or <hi>at large,</hi> that every Church-<hi>preferment</hi> in this Kingdom may have ſuch a due <hi>burthen</hi> annexed to it, that no <hi>ignorant</hi> perſon ſhould be <hi>able,</hi> no <hi>lazy</hi> or <hi>luxurious</hi> perſon <hi>willing</hi> or <hi>forward</hi> to undergoe it.
