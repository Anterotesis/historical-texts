            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that is, Rational and Unexceptionable, bringing the Glories both of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Barbarick,</hi> and whatever other piece of Ancient Wisdom was ever esteemed, to adorn and beautifie the new <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> and partly because you were an intimate Friend of the Reverend Author, whose Great Soul could not take up with little and dwindling Conceipts, but strove to enlarge his own Mind with noble and important Truths, and became a Happy Instrument in promoting the same generous Temper in others. And now, Sir, give me leave, among the other Motives which persuaded me to this Address, to add this as none of the least, that I may testifie to the World to be what I really am,</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat I may do right to that Great and Excellent Person the Author of this Discourse I have adventured to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and likewise obviate all Cavils and Mistakes which freakish Wits may make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of giving a Reason of our Faith, it will be needful to suggest somthing by way of Preface; as</p>
            <p>1. That this Discourse is principally le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd (as is intimated by the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself) against Enthusiasts and Deists: The one pretending to immediate Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so taking the various Impulses of their own Private Spirits as the sole <hi>Crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> to know and discern the Will of God, though they be never so extravagant and Contrary to the common Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: And the other pleading only for a Natural Religion in opposition to any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mode or Way of Divine Revelation; And hence though they profess to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a God and Providence, yet have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al a mean and low esteem of the Scriptures and Christianity, as if the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:42202:4"/>
were a thing that could not well be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized for, nor any fair and rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of it. Wherefore Theism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so opposite to Christian Religion as Christian, and the Natural Current of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm falling at last into down-right Atheism, it became necessary to Assert a Modest and Discrcet use of Reason in Things of Religion, and to shew that the Christian Religion will bear the strictest and severest Tryal of Right and unprejudic'd Reason.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> That our Learned Author had no Intent or Design to abet or countenance <hi>Capricio</hi>'s of such pert persons as think themselves obliged to believe and profess no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then they can maintain by their own solitary Reason applying it self to the Scriptures. Which Presumption what strange work it hath made in the World is evident from the <hi>Socinians</hi> and other Sectarists, who upon this very Ground are really bewildred in their Speculations of Things, and under Pretence of Reason have obtruded their own Fancies upon the World, and vented such crude and indigested Notions as are not only inconsistent with the clear Current of Scripture, but contrary to the sense of the best and purest Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (3<hi>ly.</hi>) according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:42202:4"/>
and meaning of the Author in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, the Authority of the Primitive Church before the Times of Apostasie, and of Reformed Churches in such Things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they generally agree with the Primitive times wherein the Church was Symmetral, is to be taken in as one solid Reason of our Faith and Belief. For the Spirit of Prophesie, which is the Testimony of Jesus, having so clearly predicted the Times of the Apostasie of the Church, it is manifest that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Profession of the Ancient Church while it was Symmetral and Apostolical ought to be had in the greatest Esteem and Veneration, and stand as a light whereby to steer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>afe from those dangerous Rocks of Errors upon which they that have neglected this and ventured wholly to their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have split themselves. Nor is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our own Church to be less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; for the being with the rest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Christendom so plainly indigitated and pointed at by the Rising of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in that Divine Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> immediately upon which follows that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acclamation in Heaven, <hi>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ,</hi> it cannot be but a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Confirmation and strengthning to any
<pb facs="tcp:42202:5"/>
Man's Faith to see so clear a Testimony and Approbation of that Church whereof he is a Member given by the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, that it is really emerged and risen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the state and condition of the Church when it was Symmetral and Apostolical. And this will further appear to be of huge Consequence to private men, and of but mean Capacity in the dicussing of Things. For they being neither Philosophers, nor guiding themselves by that <hi>Synosura</hi> of the Unapostatized Church, nor of our own Church reformed into the Condition of the Church while it continu'd Symmetral, if they be pert and confident, or follow such pert &amp; confident Guides into what Errors may they not run! Wherefore here such of the Populacy will find a solid and sure Rule for their safe conduct and guidance in rendring an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or Reason of their Faith. These things I have hinted as well to prevent all sinister Interpretations of the Sense of that Pious and Learned Prelate now with God, as to free my self from all Suspicion in my <hi>Annotations</hi> of setting up Private Reason against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Ancient and Unapostatized Church, or our own Church so excellently well temper'd and reformed according to the Primitive Pattern.</p>

               <p>At inquies, concedamus probari quidem hoc Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, nihil posse credi sine Ratione; hinc tamen non constare rem ipsam credendam non posse rationi adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sari; quoniam Deo testanti adhibenda est fides, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis maximè sit rationi contrarium quod credendum proponitur: quia fieri potest ut intellectus humanus cùm maximè videtur ratione uti, hallucinetur. Sed nefas est suspicari Deum sapientissimum posse falli; aut veracissimus cùm sit, velle fallere.</p>
               <p>Equidem nihil potuisset dici verius; Deo enim testanti nemo est tam incredulus, aut sui plenus, quin fidem habeat: At illud in dubium vocatur, quomodo rem divino testimonio confirmatam dignoscamus?

               <p>4. Quartum Argumentum desumo ex Naturâ Rectae Rationis; Unde firmissimè demonstratur fieri non posse, ut quid à Deo revelatum sit ei contrarium. Delibati enim sunt hominum Animi ex mente Divinâ; Estque Recta Ratio coelesti stirpe oriunda, ad increatae sapientiae &amp; intelligentiae imaginem efficta: Est Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius quidam Intellectualis solis, lucis primigeniae si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudinem referens. Divina enim sapientia nihil aliud est, quam Idearum rerum Comprehensio, unà cum earum rationibus, affectionibus, mutuisque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationibus, sive concordiae sive repugnantiae, quae à rerum ipsarum naturâ immediatè emanant, sicut Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationes posito Fundamento &amp; Termino. Atque hasce affectiones unà cum ipsarummet rerum Ideis, eodem intuitu perlustrat Divinus Intellectus, earúmque ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; reciprocationes discernit. Atque hoc quid aliud est quam Ratio fixa &amp; stabilis, rerum omnium rationes nexúsque immoto oculo simul advertens? Hujus verò accurata effigies est Recta Ratio, menti humanae insita; quae etsi res omnes earúmque Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones unico actu retegere &amp; nôsse nequeat, eos tamen successione &amp; per vices evolvit.

utpote quae hisce praeceptis muniendis inserviant.

Adeò ut quicquid dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in Priscae Pietatis &amp; Sapientiae patrocinium, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori jure vindicaverit sibi Religio Christiana. Lecta enim S.

            <p>As therefore the Great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> has given us a rare Example of our Duty; so the Apostle of the Circumcision in the Words now read, exhorts us, <hi>Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you,</hi> i. e.

               </gap>ure life and ignominious Death of Christ was always counted ridiculous by a Mind turgid, &amp; swell'd with higher Notions and conceits. Lastly, this is that <hi>Wisdom of this World, and of the Princes of this World,</hi> who are intoxicated with vile Affections, and an<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 20. &amp; 2. 6.</note> Opinionative Knowledge, which God and every wise Man looks upon as foolishness. Such Wisdom and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations as these, are not the Off-spring of true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but the Fallacies and Paralogisms of a Mind blinded with lusts.</p>
            <p>By Right Reason therefore I understand that innate Faculty of the Soul of Man, by which it discerns the Reasons and Mutual Affections of things, and argues, and concludes one thing from another, And now I say that Christian Religion is not contrary to Reason thus understood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42202:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>There are two usual Forms of Speech pertinent to this occasion, <hi>viz.</hi> that something may either be above or contrary to Reason.</p>
            <p>But that we may speak freely and according to the nature of the thing it self; whatever is propounded to us as matter of belief ought not to be so much as above Reason, unless these words be taken in this Acception, namely, That a thing is so high and remote from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, that bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ntellect could not light upon it. There are verily some Articles of Faith which may be said to be above Reason, as to some Modes of the Thing to be believed that are not clearly revealed. Thus for Example, it exceeds the strength of Reason to give an exact Account of the manner of our Resurrection &amp; Glorification, or to make a perfect Description of the Joys and Pleasures of the Future life, or to shew how the three <hi>Hypostases</hi> are one God, or the Divine and Humane Nature one Christ: But of these things as there is no express Revelation, so neither is there an Explicit Faith required; And besides, This Obscurity is not a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ttle subservient for the begetting and concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Reverence and Esteem to the Christian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing to which an Explicit Faith is required, which so far exceeds Reason, as that it is not able to form any Conception of it. For Faith consists in Assent; the Assent follows the Judgment, but no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made of a thing that is not at all known or understood; therefore whatever exceeds all Knowledge, must needs likewise exceed all Belief. And he that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade himself that he believes a thing that he does not understand, believes he knows not what; and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly imposes upon himself with a company of words prettily put together, and giving a great sound, which yet have no Conception answering to them in the mind,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42202:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and while he dreams of believing some unintelligible Mystery, he only pursues mere shadows of words from which when the veil is withdrawn, all Faith and Sense presently vanishes.</p>
            <p>But that the Christian Religion contains nothing Repugnant to right Reason, and that the use of Reason is necessary in the Affair of Religion, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove by these following Arguments.</p>
            <p>First, If God should propound any thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that were Contradictory to Right Reason, one of these four Absurdities (nor can I think of a fifth) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow upon it; Either that God can be deceived, or may deceive, or that the Reasons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Affections of things are not Eternal and Immutable; Or lastly, that our Faculties are obnoxious to Error when they have the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most distinct Perception of their proper Objects. The first and second of these are contrary to that Notion and Idea of God which we have implanted in our Minds.</p>
            <p>As for the third, there is indeed a certain Person who asserts the Reasons of things to be contingent and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarious, and that Blasphemy, Lying, Perjury, nay, a hatred of the Divine Majesty may be reckoned into the Account of Virtues, and become a Worship plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and acceptable to God. But good God! What rash and abominable Positions do we hear! Such as are rather to be buried in Eternal Oblivion, or not to be named without Horror and Astonishment. Search the Ancient Councils, and you shall find no Heresie more deserving an <hi>Anathema</hi> then this. Nay the very Jaws of Hell could not belch out any thing more detestable and blasphemous. For this robs God of his Wisdom, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability, Goodness, and all those other Perfections we attribute to him: It overthrows the Principles and Foundations of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Discourse; makes Contradictions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42202:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
become probable; destroys all Trust and Confidence in the Divine Promises, and banishes all Hope and Expectation of Future Happiness. That all these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences do naturally flow from this Principle we have proved elsewhere, and the same will appear very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any that shall attentively consider it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth, That God should plant such Faculties in us as may then deceive us when they most clearly and distinctly perceive their Respective Objects, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Divine Goodness and Veracity. Moreover, it is impossible that God should reveal any thing as an Object of Faith, unless we first suppose, that we must give credit to our own Faculties. For nothing can be delivered to us from God, unless it be conformable to some Faculty or other: But and if that Faculty may be deceived when it most clearly and distinctly per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eives its Object, how are we assured that this Deception may not happen in the present Case, especially wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n Reason, the chiefest of our Facultys, clearly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently finds that to be false which is offered under the specious Pretext of Divine Revelation? For this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation must be conveyed to us either by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ar, or some other External sense, or else by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: But ought we not much rather to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that to be an Illusion which is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rary to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Evident and sound Reason, then to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ancy that our Reason which is given us of God for a Guide, should be deceived in its clearest and most distinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of things? For if we throw a way Reason, there is no other Directive Faculty, but External sense and its Inclinations, and blind, and uncertain Phansie which is obnoxious to innumerable Deceptions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bidding adieu to Reason do we not evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selves to the Illusion of every Jugling Spirit,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42202:19"/>
who by crafty Tricks shall counterfeit a Divine Power and Assistance? If therefore <hi>Moses</hi> ordain'd his Law as a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to try the Truth of a Prophet, advising his People not to hearken to any who should do Signs and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, if he taught a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y thing contrary to that Law which he himself had delivered to them from God: Ought not we in like manner to examine all those that pretend Divine Authority, by the Law of Nature and Right Reason, as by an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>allible and unerring Rule? (By the way it is to be noted, that I here speak of incorrupted Reason, freed from all evil Affections and inlightned by the Spirit of God.) For without the help of this Guide, our Minds perhaps may be filled with a Great Measure of Confidence and Obstinate Persuasion, but can never attain any settled Assurance that they are in the right way. Neither is it any thing to the Purpose, to say that Reason may indeed judge of Humane, but not of Divine Things. For though this be true of Reason darkned with evil Passions, and indubitable in such things as are rather Objects of Taste, and Internal sense, than Reason, yet it is quite otherwise where the Assent of the Understanding alone is required. For whatever is proposed as matter of Explicit Belief, there must in the first place be a Conception formed of it; but now whatever we can frame a Conception of, there Reason either discovers the Harmony of the Terms of which it consists, and its Agreement with some common Notion, and so pronounces the Thing to be true; or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se it finds the Terms to be contradictory and Repugnant, and that the Thing is Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to some i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate Principle, and consequently judges it to be false: Or else it perceives the Terms to be partly agreeing and partly di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>onant, or to have no Relation at all to one another, and from hence affirms
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42202:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and allows the Thing to be either Probable or Possible. And now if any Part either of the Probability or Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility shall be confirmed by some Illustrious Miracle, then Reason adds its Suffrage that it ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.

But now when that which is barely looked upon as Possible shall be effected and accomplished by Divine Power, and the Author of this Doctrine inabled to work such stupendious Miracles as never Man before saw, Reason will presently conclude that the Thing it self is very credible.

aforesaid Faculties, and relying upon first and self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles, summons Discourse, and deduces Conclusions. Natural Instinct is always to be believed; but sense, as well External as Internal, may sometimes be deceived, and therefore sometimes deserves Credit, and at other times not; to discriminate and discern the Differences of which is in the Power of Reason alone, there being no other Faculty to preside in this Case. From whence it follows: First, That the Mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assent to any thing where Right Reason, or at least some shadow of it, does not give a preceding light; And then, That Christian Religion requiring Faith, cannot force or compel assent against the Dictates of Right Reason.</p>
            <p>But against these Clear and Natural Sentiments the Enthusiasts importunately urge the Spirit, and indeed every man will pretend the Testimony of the Spirit t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If we demand how they know the Testimony of the Spirit, they Answer, After the same manner as we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the splendor of the Sun, by its own proper light. But we insist further; That witness which the Spirit bears to it self, is it a strong and obstinate Persuasion, or an Ecstatical Joy, or a kind of Zeal and Fervor of Mind; or Lastly, a clear and savoury Persuasion of the Dignity and Excellency of those things that are revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? If this last, it is very consentaneous and agreeable to what we have already spoken: But as for the other particulars, it is very well known what an Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of Men there have been, who upon such like grounds have very pertinaciously affirmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be compounded o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And we find most of these to have been actuated with an Excess of Joy, and transported with a seemingly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fervor. All which Effects are so far from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the Holy Spirit, that they are no better then Frenzies and Symptoms of Melancholy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Original from no higher Principle then the undue Fermentation of the Blood and Spirits, and chiefly from that Melancholy which above all other disposes the Minds of Men to fancy Divine Influxes and Illuminations For this (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirms) is wont to produce <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Wherefore to be too easie and credulous in believing an obstinate Persuasion or strong Imagination, whether there be a mixture of exultancy or zeal with it, would argue a great want of Caution and Circumspection: But we are to note especially, where our Internal Sense is so obnoxious to Error, That the Suffrages of other Faculties are first to be obtained, upon whose refusal it behooves us at least to suspend our Assent.</p>
            <p>But that we may not seem to derogate from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Person wholly to distrust his Eyes and Hands. By the same Reason, since every Man finds his Senses highly gratified with that Pleasure flowing from External and Mundane Objects, and yet not to be alike affected with things of a higher and nobler Nature; how much resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence soever he may make by Virtue of the Counsels of severer Reason, and strive to alienate his Mind from those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as things less comporting with the Dignity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet he will be no more able to reclaim himself, then the Arguments of <hi>Zeno</hi> were able to move <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes.</hi> Moreover, so long as that brisk and lively rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of sensual Pleasures draws away the Mind, it will not be at leisure to attend to the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t Whispers of that gentle <hi>Monitor</hi> within. Or perhaps it will easily slop its mouth, or at least allure it to its own side: For we are led by Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either External or Internal, not by dry and insipid Reason, which gives much what the same Account of the Delights of a Spiritual life, as a blind Man would do of colours. And doubtless it would be but lost labour to teach a blind Man how pleasant a thing it is to behold the Sun, and to enjoy the benefit of the Light, and recreate himself with the Variety of Objects. It is only the Eye that is sufficient to make such a Demonstration of these things as may affect the Mind.

For if they were not bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in declaring the Sentiments of their own Minds, it would soon appear that the Reason of all Mankind is subjugated to the Imperious Dictates of present sense.

Faculties (unless we will add Natural Instinct) capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being inlightned with the Beams of Divine Light. To return therefore from whence we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed; since our Internal Sense is so slippery and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, that Man that shall hearken to its Testimony against the Voice of all his other Faculties, must be a Person of a very Imprudent and Temerarious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>But you will say, We grant indeed that it appears from this Argument that nothing can be believed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reason, but it does not follow fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> hence, that the thing to be believed is not contrary to Reason; because we ought to credit a Divine Attestation, though the matter attested be never so much Contrary to Reason: For it may happen that Humane Understanding may thenErr, when it seems most of all to make use of Reason. But it were Impious to imagine that God who is most wise can be deceived, or being most Veracious can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>It is confest that nothing could be spoken truer; for no Man is so incredulous or self-conceited, but he will presently give credit to Divine Attestation: But the Question is how we shall know when a thing is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Divine Testimony? Will it appear from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles alone? We shall find <hi>Pythagoras, Apollonius Tya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeus,</hi> who endeavoured by Magick to keep up the Credi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I might likewise introduce the Magicians of both Worlds, all which have acted diverse things exceeding the Powers of Nature, only by Demoniacal Assistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42202:23"/>If any one therefore shall pretend a Divine Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there are Three things which he ought to prove his Authority by: Miracles, Holiness of Life, and a Doctrine worthy of God, and every way useful to Mankind. If he bring all these things, he is to be believed as sent from God. But it no way comports with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness and Veracity to bear witness to a False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or to expose men in things of the Greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to an Everlasting and inevitable Delusion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we are not only to look at Miracles, but at the Life and Doctrine of the Person who pretends them, to gain to himself the Belief of Divine Authority. To this purpose our Saviour made use of an invincible Argument against the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who objected to him that he cast out Devils by the help of the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <hi>viz.

Therefore to make up a Right Judgment concerning a Divine Testimony, the matter it self which is attested ought to come into Consideration, which if it contain any thing contrary to the setled Principles of Nature, those Miracles are not to be looked upon as Divine, but as Diabolical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.

and Delight. But now it is impossible that any one should please himself in that which is contrary to the Principles of his very Nature. And indeed to know Conclusions themselves, unless we likewise are ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from what Principles they flow, yields but a slender Delight to the Understanding: As the Pleasure of a Mathematical <hi>Genius</hi> results, not from having <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical</hi> Problems as undoubted <hi>Axioms</hi> by Heart, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For here lies the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Difference between Mankind and Bruits, in their being capable of Religion. And it is a thing abhorrent from all Reason, that that which is most Natural, and the sole Propriety of Man, should yet be contradictory to his own Faculties. Can it be imagined that God intended to perplex Humane Intellect with inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble subtleties? Or is any thing the more excellent and Venerable, because it exceeds all Understanding? Is he to be deemed the fittest subject for Religion, who is most Bigotical and carelesly credulous? Are we to put off Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature that we may become Religious? Surely to entertain the least suspicion of such a thing were the very Reproach of all Religion: Such ought to be every Man's Judgment of his Religion, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing in it absurd, unbecoming, or Repugnant to Right Reason; for what a shame were it for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be afraid of the Tribunal of Reason?

            <p>Is not Religion of such a Nature as requires our greatest Care and Diligence, as of a thing of the highest moment, and in which to have erred were our greatest Infelicity?

And can this be effected without the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? Nay further, is there need of any other Faculty in the choice of Religion, and such Principles as tend to the Regulation of Life, but only of Reason? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

is a free and ingenuous thing, that forceth none, but Captivates the Understanding with its own solitary Beauty &amp; Pulchritude. And he that thinks otherwise falsly accuses Religion &amp; introduces Superstition into its Place.</p>
            <p>4. A Fourth Argument I take from the Nature of Right Reason; from whence arises a clear Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no Divine Revelation can be contrary to it. For the Souls of Men are derived from the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>vine Mind, and Right Reason is of a Celestial Original, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after the Image of Uncreated Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is a certain Beam or Ray of the Intellectual Sun, bearing the Resemblance of Primigenial light. For Divine Wisdom is nothing else but a steady Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Idea's of Things, together with those Reasons, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ections, and Mutual Relations whether of Concord or Discord, which Immediately slow from the Nature of Things themselves, as Relations <hi>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ito fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damento &amp; termino.</hi> And the Divine Intellect does inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately penetrate and behold at one view these Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together with the Idea's of the Things themselves and discerns their Order and Reciprocations. Now what is this but fixed and stable Reason looking upon the Reasons and Connections of all things at once, and as it were with an Unmoved Eye? Whose express and accurate Resemblance is Right Reason engraven on Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Minds, which though it cannot know and lay open all things, and their respective Reasons, by one single Act, yet it explicates and unfolds them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively and in order. Moreover, we have a clear and distinct Perception of the Consent or Discrepancy of so many of these Idea's and Reasons as we have an Entire and Comprehensive view of, and accordingly undertake either the Probation or Refutation of one from another. Wherefore Humane Reason does truly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42202:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imitate and express Divine Wisdom, with this only Difference, that what she comprehends at once with one single Act, Reason deduces by many and operose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences.</p>
            <p>That God should therefore reveal any thing contrary to Right Reason, is alike impious as to suppose him to be a Liar, and to contradict the internal Conceptions of his own Wisdom. For Right Reason and Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom give the same Judgment of things, and if Humane Understanding shall at any time determine otherwise, that must not be looked upon as the Fault of Reason, but of Ignorance. Therefore if any thing propounded under the Plausible Name of Divine Revelation shall seem to contradict Reason, I ought to suspect that I do not fully conprehend the meaning of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must insist upon a further search, and resolve that God intended that to be believed, which should be most consonant to the Principles of Nature. Nevertheless I would not have Humane Understanding arrogate too much to it self, nor rashly attempt to condemn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently that which exceeds its Capacity. For if the chiefest Part of those things which are delivered and consigned by Divine Testimony, be worthy of God, and Consonant to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Faculties, as to other things we ought to yield an implicit Faith to Divine Revelations, though they seem otherwise to clash with Reason, yet to give our Assent to them, at least according to the sense of the Spirit of God, although what that is, we cannot yet so fully understand.</p>
            <p>5. A Fifth and last Argument shall be drawn from the Nature of the Christian Religion it self. And first of all as to its Precepts, their Purity, sanctity and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, both as to particular Persons, and also the Publick, are so clear to every attentive and considerative Man,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42202:26"/>
that it would be altogether super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>luous to go about to evince their Agreement with Reason: More especially when the thing it self is so fully made good already by the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> From hence it likewise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That the Promises and Comminations in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are extreamly agreeable to Reason, forasmuch as they are a kind of Hedge and Security for the Precepts contain'd in it. And though these three Parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity do far excel, yet they are not wholly different from other Religions that have taken place in the World, especially among the wiser and more Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Pagans, who set the Precepts of Morality at a high Pitch, and also held the Doctrine of Rewards and Punishments after this life. So that whatever may be said in Vindication of the Ancient Piety and Wisdom, may with greater Reason be spoken in behalf of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. For even the most profané and Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wits upon reading the Holy Scriptures have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that they contain in them the most excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Piety and Virtue.</p>
            <p>Therefore I shall choose rather to discourse briefly of Christianity under the Notion of a Determi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion different from all other, that its Conformity with Right Reason may from hence likewise be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>First, therefore, What can be thought more agreeable to Reason then that God should intrust some certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the Office of teaching and instructing Mankind in the Discharge of their Duty to him, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For the Degenerate Offspring of <hi>Adam</hi> are hugely ignorant of their Duty (whence so many ridiculous Rites of Superstition have been observable throughout all Ages) and very much need a Teacher. And besides they are obstinately and wilfully bent upon the Lusts of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42202:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Flesh, and for this Reason want such a Law-giver as may Cause a Veneration and Fear in them. And that this Legislator should be a Person of an unspotted and blameless life is very congruous, both that he may be a Pattern and Example to us, and likewise beget a Reverence and Esteem of his Doctrine. That he should be conceived by the Power of the Holy Ghost in the Womb of a Virgin without the concurrence of Man, is an excellent provision for a higher Esteem and Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Person, being separated from Humane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, and the Ordinary Course of Nature. That he should be intimately united to the Divine Nature, and so truly and properly God, adds the greater Majesty to what he should deliver. Nor could God signifie his will in a way more agreeable to the Nature of Man; for he cannot appear to us but under some Corporeal Veil; and what more fitting Mansion or Covering then our Flesh? Why may not God make use of some one of us (as the Soul doth of the Body) as an Instrument by whose Intervention he may discover his Mind to us? Here is nothing either Contrary to Reason or hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For why should the Conjunction of the Deity with the Nature of Christ more trouble the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the Union of the Soul with the Body? For the higher and more exalted Nature any thing is of, with the greater Facility may it insinuate and derive it self. But though this Person be so illustrious, yet it seems Reasonable that in reference to this Bodily life he should be of mean Quality and obscure Condition, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the same Evils and Infirmities, to which we our selves are exposed: For so we shall have mighty Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Love of God, and Patient bearing of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when we see the most Innocent Captain of our Salvation, suffer fo much upon our Account. Besides,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42202:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it is an Argument of the greatest Trust and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our Lord and Saviour, who being himself made perfect through sufferings, knows how to succour and relieve those that are oppressed under them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we may reasonably expect that God should give us some greater certainty of Eternal and Immortal life, then what was found among the Heathen, who spake very doubtfully of it; as likewise that we should be more fully assured of the Resurrection of the Body, without which the Happiness of Man cannot be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: And how ready God is to Pardon Sinners upon a true Faith and Repentance; for this we are apt to doubt of when we consider the Malignity of Sin, our own proneness to Revenge, and how rare a thing it is to find forgiveness of a fault amongst men. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he should establish the Belief of Rewards and Punishments after this life; that by looking up to those we may be allured to Obedience, and out of fear of these may be deterred from sin. And that he should gain credit to all these things both by his Miracles, and by his Death: For Miracles are the greatest Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Divine Presence. And in that he yielded himself up to Death, it is a Great sign of the Truth and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his dealing with us. Besides, It is a clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Divine Goodness towards us, who spared not his own Son that he might do us good. Nor can there be a stronger Argument to move us to Crucifie our Lusts, and to lay down our lives for the Brethren. But that our Lord by his Death became a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sins, by which God declared his Placableness, it was a design of Infinite Wisdom and Goodness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and succour the Soul under the Arguments of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency and Distrust, which it fetcht against it self from the Holiness and Justice of God, the Death of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42202:27"/>
Christ for that very End propitiating Divine Justice. His Resurrection from the Dead is likewise very Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reason, being an Ample Confirmation of his past Actions, and also a Demonstration of the Possibility of our Resurrection and Return to Life after Death. But that after his Resurrection he was exalted at the Right hand of God, and that all Prayers and Praises should be offered to God by his Mediation, and that he always makes Intercession for us, this is likewise very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reason: For hence God not only makes known to us his kindness and Good-will, but has placed our Brother at his Right hand, a Person most dear to him, and most tenderly affected towards us, through whom we may with cheerfulness and full trust make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God; Christ in the mean while deprecating God in our behalf, that we should acknowledge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Good befals us to proceed wholly and purely from the love of God. And then in that all Power both in Heaven and Earth is committed into his hands, and that he is Gods Vice-gerent, and the Head of Saints and Angels, it is a great Comfort to us, because it is he that so dearly loves us who is possest of such mighty Power. Moreover since there is without Dispute a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Polity and Government among the Blessed Saints and Angels, whom can we imagine to have better and greater Right to this Principality than Jesus Christ, who is God clothed with Humane Nature? And that both Devils and Men are sometime to be summon'd before the dreadful Tribunal of God, is very Consentaneous; for this very thought will strike Terror into the most daring Sinner, and the Solemnity of the Judgment will vindicate God from all Suspicion of Malignity and Injustice, because every Man's Conscience will testifie to him that his Misery proceeds from his own

wretched Folly. Nor can any thing be imagined more proper then that Christ should be appointed Judge; for since God cannot execute this solemn Judgment but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a visible shape, what fitter Instrument can there be for this Purpose, then that very Nature in which long ago he has taken up his dwelling? And lastly, 'tis no way discrepant from Reason, that having subdued all his Enemies, he should deliver up the Kingdom to his Father: For his Mediatory Office being designed to this Purpose, that lapsed Man may be recovered to the Life of God, and invested with endless Happiness; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perfecting this work, the Determination of his Kingdom ought to follow. Which yet is to be understood after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jesus Christ, God-Man shall from thence, and for ever continue the Prince and Head of Saints and Angels. Thus we have briefly run through the several Heads of Christian Religion, and shall not further trespass upon your Patience.</p>
            <p>What remains I shall dispatch in a Word. From what hath been already said it appears clearly indecorous and unworthy of a Christian to draw in his Religion with his Mothers Milk, and to attribute his receiving it, not to the Ingenuous Disquisition of Reason, but to the Laws of his Country, his Education, to the Dictates of some learned Man in whom he has an Implicit Faith, and such like Prejudices as these. And in Conclusion, makes it his whole business pertinaciously to defend it, not upon a due choice and difcernment between Truth and Falshood, but upon some preconceived and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Opinion. Whereas that is scarce worthy the Name of Faith, nor grateful to God, which owes its Original rather to some dull chance, then either to the Evidence of the thing it self, or the weight of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for it. Nay certain it is, that he who after
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42202:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an humble, pious, and attentive weighing of Things shall yet fall into Error, is upon better grounds to be judged if not worthy of Praise, yet at least of Pardon, then he that shall blindly and fortuitously assent, though to Truth it self.

            <head>ANNOTATIONS Upon the forogoing DISCOURSE.</head>
            <p>THe Pious and Excellently learned Author of this Discourse, being himself so Great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Reason, made it his whole Business to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Great Parts for the Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Religion. He was a well instructed Scribe for the Kingdom of Heaven, and as a Faithful Steward of the Mysteries of God, brought forth out of his Treasures things New and Old. And finding Christianity attackt and assaulted by Deists and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts, he resolutely came in to her Aid and Assistance, and by invincible Arguments hath made Good both the use of Reason in Matters of Religion, and that Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity contains nothing in it contrary to the Laws and Inscriptions of Right Reason. Upon this Foundation the whole Discourse is setled and grounded, on which I here offer such Annotations as may best serve to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and confirm that high Sense and great Reason our Ingenious Author hath curiously and with most accurate Judgment drawn together.</p>
            <p>Pag. 3, 4. <hi>What ever is propounded to us as matter of Belief, ought not so much as to be above Reason.</hi>] There are some who out of stupidity rather then a due Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42202:30"/>
of Religion, make the choicest of its Articles so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible as to be elevated above Reason, that is, in their sense, such as of which Humane Intellect can have no Conception: Then which certainly nothing can be more derogatory to that Sacred Oeconomy, which the Eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Son of God hath set on foot, nor give greater Ground to the bold Cavils and Pretentions of Enthusiasts and disguised Atheists. As if there were no other design in the Christian Religion but to amuze and puzzle Humane Understandings, by propounding a Company of intricate and perplexed Riddles, of which we can have no Apprehension, but must believe them merely because they are unintelligible. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that whatever is in its own Nature uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable can be no Object of Humane Understanding, and consequently can be no Object of Faith. And it were a vain and ridiculous Thing to tell us that God reveals unconceivable Mysteries to us, to convince us of our Emptiness and Nothingness: For Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion makes its ultimate End to be the Perfection of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; Now that which is wholly and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above Reason is likewise unintelligible, and what is so, can in no sense be said to advance and better the Faculties of Man, and perfect his Nature. 'Tis true, in this sense, and in no other, we may admit a thing to be above Reason, that is (as our excellent Author speaks) <hi>because bare Intellect could not light upon it.</hi> For the whole Frame and Contexture of Christianity shews a Wisdom exceeding that of Angels as well as Men, but yet now it is manifested and revealed to us, there is nothing in it unconceivable, nor any one Article beyond the Power of a Rational Soul to have, though not a full, yet a clear and distinct Idea of. The very Notion of God implies <hi>Incomprehensibility</hi> in it, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42202:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Rational Mind may have a very evident and clear Conception of his Nature. And that which dazles our Eyes with such an amazing lustre in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is, the Doctrine of the Trinity, was not thought either unintelligible or irrational by the wise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and most learned Pagans, though such is the Profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Mystery, that Humane Understanding could never have fall'n upon any such Thing without a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. Therefore what the best of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans discoursed of it, was but a Communication of that Doctrine which had been received by Tradition from the first Ages of the World, and was made known to them by Supernatural Revelation. The same we may say of all other Mysterious Points in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that being revealed, they bear a pleasing and agreeable Harmony with our Reasons, and do inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately correspond with something in our own Minds.</p>
            <p>Pag. 4. <hi>This Obscurity is not a little subservient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and conciliate Reverence and Esteem to the Christian Doctrine.</hi>] The Christian Religion has this in Common with all other Mysteries, that it hath a Veil drawn over its more recondite and hidden Doctrines, partly that it may not be prophaned and exposed to contempt by every common Eye; and partly to whet and shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Industry of Capacious Minds to a diligent search and inquisition after such inestimable Treasures. For as the <hi>Initiati</hi> in the Mysterious Rites both of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> were first to undergo a due Purification of themselves before they were admitted to the Presence and Fruition of the worshipped Deity; so does Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion declare its end to be the perfecting Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls, and at last conducting them by an orderly P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Adytum</hi> to enjoy the Presence of God in the highest Heavens for evermore. Hence Christianity as it is a Mystery, so in opposition to the prophane Rites of the Heathen worship, it is <gap reason="foreign">

And it is very decorous and becoming the Wisdom of God, to hide and conceal the choice Doctrines of Christianity as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treasures, behind a Cloud, that they may not be the too easie Purchase of every dissolute Person, and that Religion it self may not be contemned and disesteemed by supposing it to have nothing Venerable and excellent in it. But as the Spectators at the foot of the Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no greater Beauty and Comeliness in the Face of our Saviour then in other men, but when he ascended the Mount his Countenance appear'd to those that were capable, with a Brightness and Lustre far surpassing that of the Sun: Thus it is with his Doctrine; while we converse only below, and our Eyes are filled with Dust, and our Minds swell'd with the Lusts and Vanities of the World, we see no more Excellency and Beauty to command our Veneration and love in Christianity then in other things: But if we would ascend up to the top of the Mount by a due Purification of our Spirits, by Mortification of our irregular Appetites and by Assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our Minds to God, we should behold admirable Glories, and be enravished with the Pulchritude of the transfigur'd Face of Jesus.

Therefore that Acute Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> committed a great over-sight when he would have us doubt of the Truth of those Things whereof we have the clearest Evidence and Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e till we come to the Knowledge of a God we cannot be certain that our Faculties are not false and imposturous; for we have no way to come to the knowledge of God, but by our Faculties. And therefore this were, 1. To condemn us to an Eternal Scepticism from which there is no possibility of ever extricating our selves. 2. It is a Ridiculous way of Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove the Truth of God's Existence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rom our Faculties of Reason and Understanding; and then to prove the Truth of those Faculties from the Existence of God. 3. There being nothing more Immediate to us, nor any thing whereby we can conclude more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a thing to be true then by our own Faculties, if the Truth of our Faculties is to be proved by any thing, it is evident, it is to be proved by our Faculties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but this were also a ridiculous circular Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, to prove the Truth of our Faculties, by the Truth of our Faculties. Whence it necessarily follows that we are only to suppose our Faculties to be true, it being Impossible for us to prove them to be so. But to be above this Pitch is the Priviledge only of the Eternal

That therefore was the main<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Vol. Philosoph.</note> slip in <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> that he was not content to suppose our<note place="margin">Tom. 2. p. 161.</note> Faculties to be true, but he would prove them to be so, when he was destitute of all Argument for it, but the Truth of the Faculties themselves. But some Philosophers bring the business to a closer pinch, as they conceive, by supposing the very Essence of Truth to be clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Perceptibility, insomuch that not Omnipoteuce it self, much less Casualty, can bring to pass that what is false should be clearly perceived to be. But these otherwise witty and learned Contemplators do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That Truth is a Thing antecedent to Perceptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which respects the Perceptive Intellect, and is in it self nothing else (I mean Eternal Truths) but the necessary Coherence or Incoherence of the Terms of which the Truth it self doth consist. And therefore Perceptibility cannot be the Essence of Truth. I speak here of Truth in the Object, not in the Subject, as our Author has distinguished in his Ingenious Discourse of Truth; which no Intellect Perceptive or Conceptine makes, but finds in the Intellect <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> as his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator has also observed: Insomuch that the Divine Intellect it self <hi>quatenus</hi> Perceptive or Conceptive is not the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But that many have been mistaken when they have had such a strong Cogitation is indeed the known Disgrace of Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and Philosophy. Whence it is manifest, when they say that Omnipotence it self cannot bring to pass that what is false should be clearly perceived to be, that the Word [<hi>perceived</hi>] is fallaciously abused, to a sense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Capacity of the present Circumstan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which many have and yet have been in a mistake; and this by Casualty. What then cannot Omnipotence do in this kind, if it would?

Which is the Assertion of this our Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Pious Writer without any <hi>Cartesian</hi> Fetches and <hi>Ambages.</hi> And lastly, we may note by way of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, That clearness and distinctness of Perception in the Intellect Perceptive or Conceptive, is not the Right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth, but the Conformity of the Perception or Conception with the Thing conceived, which is Truth in the Object; and that therefore in false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the Perception of the Intellect is not only obscure, but false, because it perceives or conceives otherwise then the Thing it self is, which is the true and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally acknowledged Notion of what is false in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Things.</p>

With reference to this the Apostle says, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 16. All that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but of the World:</hi> i. e. These are the Gratifications of the Mundane Life or Animal Nature, and about such things as these the Corporeal life is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually conversant as with its proper Objects.

               </gap> what ought to be done, being ruled and guided by the Counsels and Inspirations of Right Reason. Now because the Soul cannot attend to two different Faculties or Capacities at the same time in their highest actings and Invigorations, it follows that upon the Prevalency and Enlargement of either of them, the other is sensibly dimini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rom hence we may collect these things. 1. That true Miracles may be wrought by wicked Persons; not that God does immediately concur by his Almighty Power, in assisting them to do Miracles to countenance False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, and the open Violation of his Laws, but that he may permit invisible created Spirits to exert their Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Power in producing Supernatural Effects: Whence we have no Reason to think that the Miracles, foretold to be done by Antichrist and his Followers, or by false Prophets to be mere Juggles and Delusions of our Senses, but that some of them may be real Miracles, but because they are wrought to confirm Idolatry, and to establish such Doctrines as are plainly repugnant to the Rational Faculties of Mankind, therefore we are not to heed them, but to look upon them as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Miracles of Falshood, and a Lye. And of this sort were the Miracles of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who though he might dazle the Eyes of some by the Glittering Brightness of his Counterfeit Virtues (it being for the Interest of the Divels Kingdom that he should act that part well yet he never transcended the bounds of the Animal life, but<note place="margin">

That God never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits false Prophets to do Miracles by the Assistance of evil <hi>Doemons,</hi> but only in the Case of such Falshoods as are clearly discoverable by the Light of Nature or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Dictates of Universal and Right Reason; because
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42202:38"/>
if he should, it would be an Invincible Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But (as our Author speaks a little below) <hi>it no way comports with Divine Goodness and Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to bear witness to a falshood, or to expose men in things of the greatest moment to an everlasting and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Delusion.</hi> 3. That Miracles alone are not a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Confirmation of the Divinity of a Doctrine, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they have been wrought by <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the same is asserted by <hi>Busbequius</hi> of some among the <hi>Turks;</hi> therefore besides Miracles, to perfect and compleat a Divine Testimony, there is required Holiness of life in the Person that pretends a Divine Mission, and a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine worthy of God, and every way useful to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Hence our Author adds, <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>That to make up a right Iudgment concerning a Divine Testimony the matter it self which is attested ought to come into consideration, which if it contain any thing contrary to the settled Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature, those Miracles are not to be looked upon as Divine, but as Diabolica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Delusions.</hi> Therefore for the Writers of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church to pretend Miracles now, and to rank them among the Essential Characters to prove the Truth of a Church by, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> does, when all men whose Eyes are open, discover the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of those Miracles to be the Frauds and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of cunning Priests, or if they were true, it being evident that they are wrought by Apostate Spirits for the Confirmation of such Doctrines as are clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the setled Principles of Right Reason, it is, (1.) To hazard and call in Question the Truth of those Miracles wrought by Christ and his Apostles for the Confirmation of Christianity. And (2.) to use the Words of a learned Man of our own, <q>If any strange things have been done in that Church, they prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Truth of Scripture, which foretold that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42202:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(God's Providence permitting it, and the Wickedness of the World deserving it) strange Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders should be wrought to confirm false Doctrine, that they which love not the Truth should be given over to strong Delusions. So that now we have Reason rather to suspect and be afraid of pretended Miracles as signs of false Doctrine, then much to regard them as certain Arguments of Truth. Neither is it strange that God should permit some true Wonders to be done, to delude those who have forged so many Wonders, to deceive the World.</q>

            <p>Pag. 16. <hi>If we once forsake the guidance of Reason, must not all Religion be owing either to Education, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, or some Fanatical Impulse?</hi>] To him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes the Conduct of Right Reason all Religions are

alike, and he may as well be a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> as a Christian, and indeed that he has any Religion at all, is owing chiefly to his Education, and the Laws of the Country wherein he lives. But Religion being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of choice, there must be some standing and setled Rule by which to try and judge the Truth or Falshood, the Congruity or Incongruity of it: And such a Rule as this God has furnished Mankind withal, namely Right Reason, and he that having means and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to try and examine the Religion that is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him as Matter of his Choice, shall yet carelesly content himself with it, because he has been educated and trained up in it, has his Understanding given him to no purpose, and may justly fear as a Punishment of this his careless Oscitancy and slothful Credulity, that Providence should permit him to swallow great and dangerous Errors as well as Truth. For he that believes without Reason declares himself indifferent to believe any thing right or wrong. <hi>Socrates</hi> gives this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Cebes,</hi> that he was careful to inquire into all things, and duly weigh them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and would not presently believe that which any Body said, though otherwise he had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient respect unto him. I shall subjoin what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Writer speaks to this Purpose: <q>We ought not (says he) to surrender our belief to any thing carelesly; nor, either out of idleness and sloth, or being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by the Confidence which any men assume to themselves, content our selves with an Implicit Faith: Neglecting to search and try, and prove all Things which demand to have no less then our Souls resigned up unto them. We ought therefore to suspect those who would have us believe them without putting our selves to the trouble of much search. It is a sign they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42202:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mean to deceive; for if God himself does not expect to be believed, unless there be Good witness for that to which his Ambassadours demand Assent; why should men be so presumptuous as to ask us to believe them blindly? Or why should we be such Obedient Fools, as to do more for them then God would have us do for himself? He has given us Eyes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to look about-us, especially when Men bid us wink and take any thing upon trust. He has endued us with Reason, and therefore we ought to sift, and try, and examine that which is propounded to us. And if any Body say, Do not try, nor exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; you are not able to discern the Differences of things; Believe as we teach, for we cannot deceive you: Mark that Man or Company of Men as the greatest Deceivers, who intend to impose something upon you, which will not abide the Test.</q>

            <p>Pag. 17. <hi>Religion is a free and ingenuous Thing, that forceth none, but Captivates the Understanding with its own solitary Beauty and Pulchritude.</hi>] The Soul of Man being the Workmanship of the Eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and coming into the World furnished with the Seeds and Principles of all true Wisdom and Knowledge, however its Lapse and Degeneracy have clouded and darkned its Intellectual Faculties, yet there still remaining such a Cognation and Harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and Truth, she cannot but embrace it when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duly and advantageously proposed. Now Christian Religion being likewise the Genuine Offspring of that Wisdom which has left such visible Characters and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures of it self upon the whole Frame of Heaven and Earth, the Soul of Man presently discovers all the Beautiful Emanations of it to be Congenerous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal to its own Intellectual Light, and as all like
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42202:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is attractive of its like, is gently and willingly captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and sweetly drawn as with some hidden strings to a closer and nearer union with it. And this is the Reason why Christianity neither needs, nor uses Violence or Force to beget Belief and Entertainment in Humane Minds, because it is made up only of such Things as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately Correspond with the Intellectual Frame and Furniture of the Soul. Nor indeed (supposing Religion to contain any thing contrary to Right Reason) could Men ever be forced to believe it: For such is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Rational Soul, and such are the Essential Impresses of its Intellectual Nature, that no Man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he pleases, but is fatally bound up to such Things as are agreeable to those Principles of which his Rational Nature is compounded. And if it were in the Power of any Man to believe any thing though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so contradictory and repugnant to the Natural Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Impressions of his own Mind, he might then yield as firm an Assent to Falshood as Truth, and repute all the Contradictions and Absurdities in the World to be infallible Oracles. And as he cannot arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariously fix his Mind to the Reception of a Falshood, so neither of that which is irrational; for that which is Repugnant to Right Reason is certainly false, and all the Difference between them lies only in the Number of Syllables.</p>
            <p>Pag. 18. <hi>Right Reason and Divine Wisdom give the same Judgment of things.</hi>] The Foundation of all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whether Divine or Humane lies in the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Idea's, Natures and mutual Respects and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of things; Now these not being Arbitratious, but setled, Eternally fixt and Immutable, it clearly follows that Right Reason and Divine Wisdom give the same Judgment of Things. Forasmuch as not only
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42202:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Right Reason is a Participation of the Divine Understanding, but likewise, that it is no more in the Power of God to change or alter the Idea's, Respects, and References of Things, then it is in his Power to die, or destroy his own Being. Hence a Triangle with its three Angles equal to two Right ones, and all Idea's with their Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Respects, and Habitudes, appear the same in Humane Understanding as they are Represented and Exhibited in the Divine Intellect; because our Understanding is an Abstract or Copy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Understanding; as likewise because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary would undermine and destroy the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Knowledge in the World.

            <p>Pag. 41. <hi>As to other Things we ought to yield an Implicit Faith to Divine Revelation,</hi> &amp;c.] Christian Religion sufficiently obtains its end, in that all those things which pertain to Life and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42202:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Renovation of Mens Minds into the faultless Image of our Lord Jesus, are plain and intelligible even to the meanest Capacity; but in such things as are of a more Abstruse, Profound, and Speculative Nature, it is sufficient to have an Implicit Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> to believe that the sense of all those Things that are delivered and consign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Testimony, though they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend my Capacity, whatever it is which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God, is true. For he that does not so, calls God's Truth in Question. But to believe this or that to be the true sense of them, or to believe the Modes of such and such Doctrines which are not plainly revealed in the Holy Scriptures, are thus to be explicated, and all other Explications of them utterly false, is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary either to Faith or Salvation. For if God would have had under Pain of Damnation those Doctrines which are not so plainly laid down, as that all should have the same Conceptions of them, to be equally believed by all in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and Determinate sense, it could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with his Wisdom to deliver them in obscure Terms, nor with his Justice to require of Men to know certainly the meaning of those Words which he himself has not revealed.</p>

If he had been wholly Immortal, he could not have offered himself as an Example to Mankind; for some grave Person would be very apt thus to bespeak him; you indeed do not sin, because you are free from this Body; you covet not, because an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Being wants nothing: But I have need of many Things to maintain this life of mine. You are not afraid of Death, because it can have no Dominion over you. You despise Pain, because you are Impassible.

I cannot for Righteousness sake ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer Pain or Death, because I am frail; Behold Pain and Death hath Power on me; and I overcome those things which thou fearest, that I may make thee a Conqueror over Pain and Death.

All Error is not alike hurtful and dangerous: For an Error may be purely and simply Involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or it may be in respect of the cause of it Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. If the Cause of it be some Voluntary and avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fault, the Error is it self sinsul, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its own Nature damnable. As if by negligence in seeking the Truth, by unwillingness to find it, by Pride, by Obstinacy, by desiring that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be true which sutes best with my Ends, by fear of Mens ill Opinion, or any other world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fear or Hope, I betray myself to any Error contrary to any Divine revealed Truth, that Error may be justly styled a sin, and Consequently to such a one of it self damnable. But if I be guilty of none of these Faults, but be desirous to know the Truth, &amp; diligent in seeking it, and advise not at all with Flesh and Blood about the choice of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but only with God and that Reason he has given me, if I be thus qualified, and yet through humane Infirmity fall into Error, that Error can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be damnable. Thus far a great and learned Man.</q> I may add, That a sober and serious Christian, who endeavours by all means to know the will and Mind of God, and so soon as he can discover it, is ready sincerely to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it, and has withal a lively sense of the Honour of God, and a hearty Good-will to Mankind, this Person through the Goodness of God shall be kept from falling into any dangerous and damnable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But now when any Man shall carelesly neglect to use that Reason which God has given him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate between Truth and Falshood, and shall happen to assent to Truth, not upon a due choice and discernment between it and Falshood, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42202:45"/>
blindly and fortuitously, this Assent is no way commendable, and an Involuntary Error after a clear and well qualified search is to be preferred before it.</p>
            <p>I have now finished my <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this Excellent Discourse, in which I have endeavoured to illustrate and confirm such Things, as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author has but lightly touched, at least could not largely insist upon in that concise way of a Sermon. And this I have the more readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, because I judged a Discourse of this Nature by a Person of so extraordinary Piety, such clear Intellectuals, and so every way accomplisht as our Author was, could not prove unacceptable to any of the Lovers of Truth and Ingenuity; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that I might do Honour to his Venerable Name and Memory from whom I had the Happiness of receiving the first Rudiments of Academical Learning. This I affirm moreover (with an Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deference to better and more inlightned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) that such an Explication of Religion as our Reverend and Learned Author drives at, is the most likely way not only to silence the bold Cavils of Enthusiasts and Atheists, but to eradicate all carnal and sensual Doctrines and Opinions, and to bring on through the Assistance of the Mighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God (whose presence is never wanting to the sincerely Conscientious) that Blessed and desirable State of the Church, the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> interval which our Lord and Saviour will all along fill with Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Manifestations of his Power and Providence.</p>
