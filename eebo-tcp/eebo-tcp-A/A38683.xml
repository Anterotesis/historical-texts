            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I thank you, but you know we are not ſo well skill'd, but Schollars can preach dangerous errors to us, and we not diſcern them; how dare you truſt your ſelf to be guided and taught by a ſtranger? and why do you forſake our own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter who hath ſubſcrib'd to the Articles of our Religion?</p>

               <p>Is our Miniſter bound to preach? if ſo, ſure ſome body is bound to hear him; and I know none more bound to hear him than you and I, for God by his providence hath ſet him over us, and you know we were ready and glad to receive him.

               <p>I muſt confeſs you have given me ſome reaſon why I ought rather to hear at our own Pariſh Church than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but yet I think I have very good reaſon why I have leſt it.</p>

               <p>No, I have not, but though he be not ſcandalous, yet there are many of the Clergy are.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's no reaſon why you ſhould leave him, but rather encourage and love him becauſe he is ſober; but ſuppoſe he were ſcandalous in his life, this would not be a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>preſently</hi> to leave him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt we ought modeſtly and meekly to adviſe him to live well, if this would not do, then we ought to complain of him to his Superiors that they may admoniſh him; if this would not do, we are to make uſe of the Law whereby ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and erroneous Miniſters may be ſuſpended till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and if any people have bad Miniſters, 'tis their own fault, and great ſin if they don't take this courſe with them, and till we have done our duty we can't be excuſable in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſcandalous Miniſter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, for I judge the Ordinances of God if rightly and duly adminiſtred by him, are not the worſe for the wickedneſs of the man that diſpenſeth them; for they are Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and not man's, and their excellency and efficacy come from God, and not from the righteouſneſs of any man that diſpenſeth them, ſo that if we will duly make uſe of them, his wickedneſs can't hinder us from benefit by them: we muſt take Chriſts advice <hi>Do as they ſay, and not as they do.</hi>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But why do the Biſhops ſuffer ſuch men to come into Livings, and why don't they eject them when in?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The Patron hath a right to Preſent, and if the Biſhops will not admit hee'l force him by a <hi>Quare impedit:</hi> and the Biſhop can't ſuſpend them when in, unleſs firſt he know it, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of it; and ſecondly unleſs it be prov'd and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for the Biſhop can't be Judge and accuſer both, and therefore the Church-Wardens are ſworn to Preſent ſuch; if therefore they be not proſecuted, the fault is not in the Biſhop but people. Neighbour I heartily wiſh we did more cover the nakedneſs of ſome few of the Clergy, and if they would not be reclaim'd, that they were proſecuted in a legal way, and not by Invectives and envious reflections lay the fault of ſome few upon the whole.</p>

               <p>I muſt acknowledge I can't accuſe our Miniſter, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64045:3"/>
the reaſons why I go from him, are, firſt becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer is read at his Church, ſecondly becauſe I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more by another man that preacheth in private.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>In anſwer to your firſt reaſon, I remember you have gone to hear at the Church though the Common-Prayer was read there, at leaſt you were wont to come in after it was done; why is it more unlawful for you to come now than it was then? If you ſcruple at Common-Prayer, why do you not joyn with us in the reſt? Beſides, how many of you will hear it at a Chriſtning? Do the ſweet Meats and Wine make it more lawful at that time than it is at another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>It is Maſs, 'tis Porridge, 'tis Bibble bable, 'tis Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, 'tis Superſtition, and ſhall I come to hear where it is?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I pray be not angry, but hear me meekly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are good prayers made to the true God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and I can't account it leſs than a kind of Blaſphemy, and an high breach of the third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deride and ſcorn them; 'tis true, <hi>Elijah</hi> mockt at the prayers of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, but 'twas becauſe they prayed to a falſe God, but is it not horrible wickedneſs for thoſe that own the true God, to deride thoſe prayers that are made to him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſome part of the Bible in the Maſs, is it e're a whit the worſe for being there? no more are good prayers the worſe for being in the Maſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why is not your way more <hi>Will</hi>-worſhip than ours? wherein you have more your own <hi>Will,</hi> and inventions than we have? your Miniſter invents what prayers, and what way of Adminiſtring the Sacraments he <hi>pleaſeth,</hi> and this he <hi>will</hi> do, though more wiſe, pious, and learned men have made better; and King, Lords, and Commons, and the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have advis'd and enjoyn'd the uſe of them; hath not he high conceits of himſelf? much of confidence and <hi>will</hi> in his worſhip? and little of modeſty, that thinks himſelf wiſer and his own inventions, better than theſe? is not yours <hi>Will</hi>-worſhip?</p>
               <p n="4">4. I have been taught, that Superſtition can't be in a prayer or any external thing, but that 'tis in our minds, it being an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64045:4"/>
evil apprehenſion of God; and ſo thoſe that are againſt Common Prayer may be as guilty of Superſtition as they that uſe it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I pray tell me, and ſpeak your conſcience, do you not think that if you ſhould heartily joyn with the Miniſter in it, if you ſhould uſe the Confeſſions with true repentance for ſin, the Petitions with ſincere deſires for thoſe good things they mention, and the thankſ givings with love and praiſes to God in your ſoul; this would not be more pleaſing to God than turning your back upon it, and ſcoffing at it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But they are ſuch cold and formal prayers, that I can't lift up my heart in the uſe of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Surely you are highly miſtaken, to think that good prayers can be formal, or make you cold and dead in praying them?</p>
               <p n="1">1. To pray by a form is lawful and good, elſe why would our Saviour have left us a form? why do we uſe Pſalms? do you not uſe a form for a Grace at Meals? are not extempory prayers forms to the hearers, for the hearers muſt no more vary from them, leaſt they be guilty of wandring thoughts, than we from the Common-Prayer? and ſome muſt uſe a form in their Families, or not pray at all, they having not good and ready inventions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I alway thought evil formality in prayer conſiſted not in a form of words, but in a lazy formal temper of minde, ſo th t if you be not ſerious in uſing Common or other prayers, 'tis you that are formal, and not the prayers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides I finde, and me thinks 'tis reaſonable, that thoſe words whoſe form and Emphaſis I have conſidered of and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended before, ſhould at the uſing of them moſt readily (when I have not time to meditate) and moſt powerfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my heart by the way of my <hi>judgment;</hi> and that extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pory inventions do moſt uſually but raiſe the affections by the force of the <hi>fancy,</hi> as Poets, Muſicians, &amp;c. finde by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I cannot believe that bate inventing and affectionate u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of new words every time we pray, is praying by the Spirit, but certainly to pray by the Spirit, is to exerciſe Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Humility, Faith, Repentance, and the reſt of the Graces
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64045:4"/>
of the Holy Spirit in our hearts in prayer, and ſeeing words are but to expreſs our minds, and that thoſe Graces in out hearts may be expreſt by a form of words; I ſee not why he that prays by a form, may not at leaſt as well pray by or wiſh the Spirit as others.</p>

               <p>Truly friend, I finde I can't twice a day invent a new form fit to be pray'd in my Family, and therefore do moſt uſually uſe a form of words, which I ſee my Children and Servants better underſtand than extemporary prayers. But that which makes ſome of the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> think Common-Prayer unlawful, is the Impoſition of it.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Though I think out Governors may impoſe lawful things, yet it not much concerns us to diſpute that, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are to obey them or not; and for this I would fain underſtand, how that which was lawful for me to do before impoſed, ſhould by being impoſed become unlawful; or when are we more bound to obey Magiſtrates than when they command lawful things? Seeing their commands which are about lawful things take away only the liberty of our <hi>actions,</hi> but not the liberty of our <hi>conſciences,</hi> which is properly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty; the former is a due to our lawful Superiours, the latter only a tribute to God; therefore the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Church, and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and all the Reformed Churches have Forms which they uſe in Publick.</p>

               <p>I ſuppoſe you mean the Ceremonies, Surplice, Croſs, and Kneeling, which have been enough diſputed by others; all that I will anſwer to you is, that I muſt confeſs there is no expreſs Scripture for them, and yet I don't count them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>

               <p>I pray ask your Miniſter whether there was any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church then Biſhops from the Apoſtles times, till Mr. <hi>Calvins,</hi> who liv'd about a hundred years ago? I know you quarrel at our Biſhops greatneſs, but that alters not their Office, and ſhall thy eye be evil becauſe the King's and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors hath been good to them? is it any evil in thee to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what is given thee? I do believe that many that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them are truly godly, but I do not count it any part of their piety, but their great miſtake; and when I conſider that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith Charity is the chiefeſt grace, I am afraid there are too few of them truly godly, becauſe they are ſo full of ſcoffing, railing, envy, and <hi>bitterneſs againſt Biſhops: and although our Saviour enjoyns us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to</hi> love and do good, to bleſs and pray for thoſe that are our enemies, yet they pray againſt their ſuppoſed enemies, and 'tis ſaid, will faſt and pray whole days to beſeech God to curſe them. Oh horrid! the Devil would do thus too, but that he knows 'tis to no purpoſe. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are enjoyn'd to pray for <hi>Heathen</hi> Governors, and do they act like Chriſtians that pray againſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors?

You are too near of kin to the Monſters of the other end of the Town that ſcoff at all Religion, onely you pretend to do it in zeal for Religion: but this wont excuſe the Devil, that he pretends to be an Angel of light.

All Reformed Churches take to themſelves a power of impoſing indifferent things, the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants appoint the poſture of ſtanding at the Lords Supper, and will not give it to any that ſit: the <hi>Dutch</hi> impoſe ſitting, and will not give it to any that ſtand, and ſhall they have power to appoint ſtanding or ſitting, and not we kneeling? You know God appointed the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64045:7"/>
Paſſover to be taken ſtanding, yet the Jews afterward altered this poſture, and commanded ſitting or leaning, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour obey'd them, and did eat the Paſſover ſitting or lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Jews appointed Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>days that God never appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Feaſt of Dedication, no where mentioned but in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and yet Chriſt obſerves this Feaſt; <hi>John</hi> 10. But what need I ſay more? the Presbyterians appointed the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of holding up the hand at the taking the Covenant, and an Oath is a piece of worſhip to God: and yet they will ſay ſomewhat that they make you believe they are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their conſciences.</p>

               <p>I do think Governors ought to enact ſuch Laws as they in their conſciences think beſt for the Nation, and ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons as can't ſubmit to thoſe Laws, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſuffer, and yet not count it perſecution; For perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is when men ſuffer for being Righteous, our governors aim'd at peace, and not at puniſhing of them for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or for being righteous; for they may be as good Chriſtians as they will as to their faith and manners, they may be as humble as meek, as juſt, as ſelf-denying as they will; they may worſhip God after their own way, in their own families, and never be puniſh'd for it; and beſides, have ſufficient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of worſhipping God in publick. The great conteſt is, who ſhall rule and govern the Church, they, or the King and Parliament, whoſe model or way ſhall take place; and if all will not ſubmit to them 'tis perſecution. Is this the ſame caſe with Chriſts and the Apoſtles? they were perſecuted for preaching the Goſpel, becauſe the then Governors would not have had Chriſtian Religion preacht at all, but our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours not only ſuffer thoſe that will ſubmit to be ruled by them to preach the Goſpel, but encourage them, and therefore we ſee as good preaching here abouts as ever there was.</p>

               <p>I am glad to hear it, and do heartily wiſh it be not a meer change from one ſin to another. I remember the Jews ſaid of

                  <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> becauſe he came <hi>neither eating nor drinking he had a Devil,</hi> but of Chriſt becauſe he came <hi>eating and drinking he was gluttonous,</hi> &amp;c. though they wrongly apply'd it, yet their rule was this, that thoſe that <hi>only</hi> reſrain'd from gluttony and drunkenneſs, had Devils, <hi>i. e.</hi> envy, pride, hypocriſie, and ſuch luſts within them. Let me ask you therefore, are they not hugely affected to the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> way? do they not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily (or as they call it, zealouſly) condemn all that are not of their way? would they not count it a kind of Apoſtacy and backſliding from grace for any to forſake private meetings, and receive the Supper in publick?</p>

               <p>I will therefore Neighbor open my heart to you, and tell you I was once in your condition, I thought to be affected with a Sermon, was profiting by it, and you know we are moſt apt to be affected with novelties, and therefore I had an <hi>itching ear,</hi> and ſeldom could be pleaſed with one man long, and I did above all moſt loath and deſpiſe my own Miniſter as being ſtale to me, God forgive me for it, for I was highly pleas'd with him at firſt, at laſt I began to reflect upon my ſelf, and to conſider what good I had got by all theſe preachers: I found that having got the name of a Profeſſor, I abhor'd to be guilty of any outward enormity, and was very forward to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64045:10"/>
diſpute and talk of Religion, and was uſually very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in hearing and praying, and I us'd to complain of a naughty heart, and of the withdrawings of God if I were not ſo; and I really thought my ſelf in one of the higheſt forms of Religion; but upon ſearching my heart, and ſtrictly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf, I found I had moſt abominable vices reigning in my ſoul, particularly pride, covetouſneſs, envy, and malice, cenſoriouſneſs, diſobedience to Superiors, and the like, then I knew that my Religion was artificial, void of inward life, and I was aſtoniſht and affrighted at my ſad condition; I went to our Miniſter, whom I was convinc't God had ſet over me to inſtruct me, and that therefore I was moſt likely to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from God by him, I told him my condition, and askt him what I ſhould do to profit by the word? He moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately entertain'd me, though I had ſo ſlighted him and moſt gravely advis'd me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I would lay aſide all pride and conceitedneſs, for <hi>God reſiſts the proud, but gives grace to the humble;</hi> want of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this hath been a great reaſon why you have not profited by the word; for you have not come with any deſign to learn from the Miniſter, but to be a judge whether he preacheth well or not; you have not come as a Diſciple to a Maſter, or as a child to a Father to be inſtructed; but you lookt on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not as <hi>Gods Ambaſſador, and in Chriſts ſtead,</hi> but as one to act a part, and ſay a leſſon, and that his only end was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf or pleaſe you, and therefore you us'd <hi>in hearing</hi> to obſerve whether you were pleas'd or not; and <hi>after hearing</hi> did not conſider what you had been taught, and what was your duty to <hi>do,</hi> but only did either commend or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Preacher, was it not thus? I told him I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it was ſo, you muſt, proceeded he, lay aſide this, the Phariſees were moſt unreachable by Chriſt, becauſe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their Knowledge and Piety, they heard not to learn, but to judge, but the lower valleys are moſt refreſht and made fruitful by rain's from Heav'n. Therefore be ſenſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Miniſter is Gods Ambaſſador, that the plaineſt truths are of greateſt concernment, and therefore moſt to be taught by your Miniſter and learnt by you, conſider them moſt, and be not ambitious after high ſpeculations, and never reckon that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64045:10"/>
you have learnt any truth enough, till you find it hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued you into obedience to it. I reſolv'd to take his advice, and pray'd him to go on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond advice I would give you, quoth he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that you do not hear meerly to be <hi>efected</hi> and <hi>pleas'd,</hi> but make this the end both of your praying and hearing <hi>to live better;</hi> ſo that when you hear the Miniſter ſpeak againſt ſin, imploy not your ſelf to hear how he will acquit himſelfe what notions, ſtories, gingles, phraſes or elegancies he hath, but raiſe up thy hatred againſt that ſin by all the evil he tells thee there is in it, and <hi>take and follow</hi> his advice how to reſiſt and ſtand againſt it; what ever duty thou heareſt him preach of, let the reaſons be brings to convince thee, 'tis thy duty, make thee reſolve to <hi>practice</hi> it, and follow the directions and helps he gives thee: Thou muſt hear thy Miniſter, not as we hear Muſick, only to be <hi>pleas'd,</hi> but as a ſick man doth a Phyſician; in order <hi>to do</hi> what he is advis'd for his health. And not ſtriving to practice what we hear, is <hi>the</hi> reaſon why the word no more profiteth; for, ſaid he, the ſpirit of God works upon us <hi>by us,</hi> and then only are we moſt likely to have the helps of Gods ſpirit, when we are endeavouring to do duties enjoyn'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are two great benefits of the ſpirit, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi> 1. <hi>Light</hi> and conviction of our judgments and conſciences, this we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>in hearing and praying,</hi> but yet not unleſs we duly give up our minds to be taught by the ſpirit of God. The ſecond is <hi>strength</hi> to do duties, and this the ſpirit gives us ordinarily, not <hi>in bare hearing and praying,</hi> but <hi>in doing thoſe duties we heard and pray'd for grace to do,</hi> ſo that we are as the widdows cruiſe of oil then we have increaſe from God when pouring out, then more Talents given, when we improve what we have: ſo that thou muſt not hear and pray, and then wait till the ſpirit gives thee ſtrength; but as ſoon as thou haſt heard what thou art to do, up and be doing, <hi>work out by ſalvation,</hi> for then, and not till then <hi>will God work in thee</hi> and help thee; do thus, and I make no queſtion but thou will profit by the word. Sir, ſaid I, I muſt confeſs I have been defective in this, for I uſually firſt expected impulſes and a kind of force offer'd to my ſoul to do duties, and thought it in vain to attempt conquering a luſt till I were ſo furniſh'd, but you tell me I muſt firſt be ſtriving e<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I pray, ſaid he, moſt affectionately with tears in his eyes, pity the poor Church that is wounded and torn in pieces, and no longer fill your head with thoſe ſtories and complaints which the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of men ſuggeſt to you, but let this be your great care to be good and to live well; And if you joyn to theſe things moſt hearty and fervent prayers to God for his bleſſing, who will moſt freely give his holy ſpirit to them that ask, I dare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that you will profit by attending upon the word.</p>
               <p>I did reſolve to do as he had adviſed me, and though I found it at firſt difficult and another kind of work than I had bin us'd to, yet I find now it was the beſt advice that ever I had, and now can profit by any preacher that doth but preach truth; becauſe I do not concern my ſelf ſo much with, who the man is, what party, or way he is of, what affections or elegancies he hath in is Sermon, as with the truths he taught, and what God by him commands me to do, and ſo I preſently ſet upon practiſing of it, and I find that God is ready to help the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.

But I muſt tell you I benefit by no man ſo much as our own Miniſter, who I obſerve preacheth alway, not that which may moſt pleaſe us and commend himſelf, as ſtrangers are apt to do, eſpecially thoſe that live by the Benevolence of the people, but that which will do us moſt good; and now I am no more inclinable to go from our own Church, than a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate abſtemious man is to go to feaſts, who though he may now and then go with a friend, yet is quickly weary of it, and chooſeth for conſtancy to feed at home.</p>

               <p>I pray Neighbour do, and lay aſide prejudice which is utterly unteachable, and think not your ſelf perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is a great fault of the <hi>Non-conformiſts;</hi> how pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily will they blame Governors, as if Parliament and Counſel were but fools to them, and the Common people will ſo confidently decide Controverſies, that they condemn all as unchriſtian that are not of their mind, and all that are, are <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> the Saints and the Godly. I pray alſo conſider how good and pleaſant a thing it is for Brethren to live together in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 1, 10. <hi>Beſeecheth us in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we ſpeak the ſame things, and that there be no diviſions among us, but that we be perfectly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment;</hi> it ſeems they began to ſeparate then, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Miniſter and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 2. but many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> divided from him, and ſome followed <hi>Apollo,</hi> others <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. though this was out of zeal, and as good deſigns as you can have, probably, becauſe <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo was</hi> an excellent Preacher, and <hi>Peter</hi> a zealous man, yet he calls them <hi>carnal</hi> for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3, 4. I pray conſider how great prejudice diviſions do the Goſpel, nothing makes any ſo unwilling to be a Member of any Society as their quarrels, and this certainly is a grand remora to the Heathen's turning Chriſtians, becauſe we no better agree among our ſelves, hence St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2. 2, 3. ſaith <hi>fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind, let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of mind let each,</hi>

                  <hi>eſteem other better than themſelves.</hi> The Papiſts boaſt of the great harveſt they have by our diviſions, for the great argument they uſe is this, you ſee how the Proteſtants are divided, but we are all of one mind; had you as much zeal for the credit of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant cauſe,</hi> as you have for your own <hi>Party,</hi> you would not do thus; how great uncharitablneſs have you to us that will not worſhip God with us, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with us as if we were <hi>Heathens and Publicans?</hi> were we not bound by the command of God to obey Superiors, and to ſubmit to Governors, we would rather comply what we could with you, than that ſuch a breach ſhould continue, but ſeeing we are <hi>bound,</hi> and may not wound our conſciences, and you are <hi>free</hi> to return, yea, have the ſame obligation upon you to h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It is ſad there is ſo much Whoredom, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Swearing, but theſe in themſelves tend not half ſo much to the ruine of a Nation, as Diviſions, Schiſms, and Separations; for Parties and Sects are as fewel, and diſcontents are as fire, and there wants nothing but ſome miſchievous hand to lay them together, and to blow them up into a flame, moſt civil wars are thus rais'd. I pray God prevent my fears, and change yours and every ſuch mans heart, that we may modeſtly and meekly ſubmit to Governors, and live in love, and unity, and peace one with another, and the God of peace will be with us. <hi>Amen.</hi>
