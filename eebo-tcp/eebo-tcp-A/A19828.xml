            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>NOw that the hand of death hath layd thee there</l>
            <l>Where all must lie, and leuel'd thee with th'Earth,</l>
            <l>Where men are all of them alike, and where</l>
            <l>There are no seu'rall roomes for state or birth:</l>
            <l>Now thou hast nothing left thee but a name</l>
            <l>(O noble <hi>Deuonshire</hi>) and all is gone</l>
            <l>With thee, except the memorie, and same</l>
            <l>Of what thy vertue, and thy worth hath done:</l>
            <l>Now shall my verse which thou in life didst grace,</l>
            <l>(And which was no disgrace for thee to doe)</l>
            <l>Not leaue thee in the graue, that darkesome place</l>
            <l>That few regard, or haue respect vnto.</l>
            <l>Where all attendance, and obseruance ends,</l>
            <l>Where all the Sun-shine of our fauor sets;</l>
            <l>Where what was ill, no countenance defends,</l>
            <l>And what was good, th'vnthankfull world forgets.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:9772:3"/>Now shalt thou haue the seruice of my pen,</l>
            <l>(The tongue of my best thoughts) and in this case,</l>
            <l>I cannot be suppos'd to flatter, when</l>
            <l>I speake behinde thy backe, not to thy face.</l>
            <l>And am vntide from any other chaine</l>
            <l>Than of my loue, which free-borne draws free breath;</l>
            <l>The benefite thou gau'st me to sustaine</l>
            <l>My humble life, I lose it by thy death.</l>
            <l>Nor was it such, as it could lay on me,</l>
            <l>Any exaction of respect, so stronge,</l>
            <l>As to enforce my obseruance beyond thee,</l>
            <l>Or make my conscience differ from my tongue.</l>
            <l>Let those be vassals to such seruices</l>
            <l>Who haue their hopes, or whose desires are hye,</l>
            <l>For me, I haue my ends, and know it is</l>
            <l>For Free-men to speake truth, for slaues to lye.</l>
            <l>And if mistaken by the Paralax</l>
            <l>And distance of my standing too farre off</l>
            <l>I heretofore might erre, and men might tax</l>
            <l>My being to free of prayses, without proofe.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:9772:3"/>But here it is not so, and yet the choyce</l>
            <l>Of those I made did yeald the greatest show</l>
            <l>Of honour and of worth, and had the voyce</l>
            <l>Of present times their virtues to allow.</l>
            <l>And if they haue not made them good, it is</l>
            <l>No fault of mine, nor ought it to be layd</l>
            <l>To disrepute these my obseruances,</l>
            <l>True prayses doe adorne, the false obrayd:</l>
            <l>And oftentimes to greatnesse we are glad</l>
            <l>To attribute those parts we wish they had.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Deuonshire</hi> I here stand cleere with thee</l>
            <l>I haue a manumission to be free,</l>
            <l>I owe thee nothing, and <hi>I</hi> may be bold</l>
            <l>To speake the certaine truth of what I know,</l>
            <l>There is no power remaines in thee, to hold</l>
            <l>The tongues of men, that wilbe talking now.</l>
            <l>And now being dead <hi>I</hi> may anatomise,</l>
            <l>And open here all that thou wert within,</l>
            <l>Shew how thy minde was built, and in what wise</l>
            <l>All the contexture of thy heart hath been:</l>
            <l>Which was so nobly fram'd, so well compos'd,</l>
            <l>As virtue neuer had a fairer seat.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:9772:4"/>Nor could be better lodg'd nor more repos'd,</l>
            <l>Than in that goodly frame, where all thing sweet,</l>
            <l>And all things quiet, held a peacefull rest;</l>
            <l>Where passion did no suddaine tumults raise</l>
            <l>That might disturbe her, nor was euer brest</l>
            <l>Contayn'd so much, and made so little noise,</l>
            <l>That by thy silent modestie is found</l>
            <l>The emptiest vessels make the greatest sound.</l>
            <l>For thou so well discernd'st thy selfe, had'st read</l>
            <l>Man and his smoake so well, as made the force</l>
            <l>The lesse to speake, as being ordain'd to spread</l>
            <l>Thy selfe in action, rather than discourse.</l>
            <l>Though thou hadst made a generall Suruiew</l>
            <l>Of all the best of mens best knowledges,</l>
            <l>And knew as much as euer learning knew,</l>
            <l>Yet did it make thee trust thy selfe the lesse,</l>
            <l>And lesse presume; and yet when being mou'd</l>
            <l>In priuate talke to speake, thou didst bewray</l>
            <l>How fully fraught thou wert within and prou'd</l>
            <l>That thou did'st know, what euer wit could say.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:9772:4"/>Which shew'd thou hadst not bookes as many haue</l>
            <l>For ostentation, but for vse, and that</l>
            <l>Thy bountious memorie was such, as gaue</l>
            <l>A lardge reuenu of the good, it gat.</l>
            <l>Witnesse so many volumes whereto thou</l>

            <l>And markt them with that print as will shew how</l>
            <l>The point of thy conceiuing thoughts did stand.</l>
            <l>That none would thinke if all thy life had been</l>
            <l>Turnd into leasure, thou couldst haue attaind</l>
