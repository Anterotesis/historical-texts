            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long ſince we had publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain Pamphlet, intituled <hi>the Engliſh Oracle,</hi> ſomething claiming affinity with this: The Title of which was not confirmed by the Purport. For inſtead thereof we had a long Circumlocution, condemning the Noble Science of Aſtronomy, and all it's Speculations; although I eſteem him no competent Judge of any matter whereof he hath not ſome knowledge; and conſequently a too bold ſentencer of it. That there may be Predictions learnt from that Siderial School is undeniable; being conſonant to the judgment of all Antiquity. The reading of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>'s Ruin among the Stars, preceded the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment many years. Nay <hi>Poſtel,</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Writer, doth take God and Chriſt to witneſs, That in the Hebrew Characters among the Stars <hi>(Vidit omnia quae in Rerum naturae conſtituta ſunt,)</hi> He ſaw all things that were conſtituted by Nature.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52895:3"/>
Nor was <hi>Poſtell</hi> Lunatick when he broke forth into that Proteſtation. But I ſtay no longer on this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, leſt I ſhould ſeem guilty of that which I condemn.</p>
            <p>If we may credit <hi>Albumazar</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> about the motions of Celeſtial Bodies, whoſe influence doth excitate and procure continual change in this lower Region, we ſhall find this Year, That the Moon's Eclipſe will be the cauſe of many mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Her Eclipſe I find by my skill will be in one of the Twelve Months of the Year.</p>

               <p>But let us take the beginning and end of the Year in their due courſe; And firſt of all for <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> according to my account is the firſt Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Quarter of the Year; and ſhall have a ſooner beginning and longer duration with poor Men than with Rich. This ſeaſon ſhall be ſubject to ſo great Froſts, that unleſs lookt to, Charity will not only catch cold, but be congeal'd to a ſtone; and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of its deſigned kindneſs, prove the contrary by Oppreſſion.

Brokers, Projectors, Trencher-Flies, caſt up this ſeaſon, when all things are Creſcent, that though they nip not (like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Frogs) every flower of the Field, yet will they hurt the moſt part of all the wholeſom Herbs they come to, unleſs ſome ſtrong Eaſterly Wind drive them up the Hill, to that leaveleſs Tree that bears no fruit of it ſelf, but rids Vermine from others.</p>

               <head>Now for ſome General Predictions on the whole Year.</head>
               <p>This Year 1679. The <hi>Golden Number</hi> ſhall have no place in poor Men's Purſes. And this Year many ſhall go ſober into Taverns, where, by a certain <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis,</hi> they come out Mad. This Year ſhall be dub'd many Ale-quaffers into fellowſhip with that ancient and much deſir'd Order of <hi>Red-Roſes.</hi> Likewiſe, This Year ſhall be born many ſtrange Children, that when they come to Age, will be ſo ignorant that they ſhall not know their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And whereas the Eclipſe of the Moon this Year is ſhort; it ſignifies to us that Womens love ſhall be very ſhort and Momentary; inſomuch that hereupon divers great ſtorms ſhall happen, and many loud Winds, together alſo with incredible Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, (no leſſer than Joint-ſtools) ſhall fall upon Mens heads.</p>
               <p>I portend alſo, that ſundry other Occurrences ſhall happen; Many ſtrange and woful Diſeaſes ſhall Raign: as <hi>hollowneſs of the Heart, infirmities of the Tongue;</hi> ſo that, that Member ſhall play the Harlot, and lie with all Men.</p>
               <p>Moreover alſo, I foretel to thoſe <hi>Patient Things,</hi> whoſe Wives are as <hi>light</hi> as their Weights, that they ſhall be troubled with great ſwellings in the Brows, and unleſs that Diſtemper be met and prevented, it will certainly break out into that pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſeaſe of the <hi>Horn-Cholick.</hi> Likewiſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52895:4"/>
of the abounding of Cherries, Plums, and other ſtony-fruit this Year; by eating thereof many Men ſhall be troubled with a Diſtemper of ſuch a Nature as none can cure but Cunning Women.</p>
               <p>I Predict further; many Citizens, Sailors, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocators and others, ſhall have great luck in Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for though the Game be too quick of foot which they follow, yet going homewards, they ſhall have the fortune to meet with ſome deſireable Purchaſe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, This Year I infallibly Prognoſticate that Silver ſhall be dearer than Tin, and Gold more precious than Lead; and, as it is thought by ſome, ſo much ſcarcity of either, that a whole Teem of Knights of the Poſt ſhall not be able to draw <hi>100l.</hi> through <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> without the help of a ſubſtantial Fore-horſe.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, I Prognoſticate, That Hens, Capons, Geeſe, and ſuch Dainties, ſhall little haunt poor Mens Tables this Year; but fly quite away to fat Churls Houſes. And for thoſe Miſers, although few things concern them in this Propheſie, yet let me give them this <hi>Caveat,</hi> That having Clothes enough, they keep themſelves warm; and having Coals enough, they provide good Fires; and having a liberal Purſe, they go to Bed always with a Cup of <hi>Malaga;</hi> and having a good Wife, they make much of her: and then for ought I can perceive by my skill, they are like to live as long as they can, though not ſo long as they would; and not die one hour before their time.</p>
