            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE (Whether Diſſenting, or Conſenting) Readers.</head>
            <p>THough the Concealment of my Name might (perhaps) be ſome Security to me, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any one ſhould be offended at the following Papers; yet have I not thereupon allow'd my ſelf a Liberty (too commonly taken) to reflect upon and cenſure thoſe, whoſe Sentiments are not the ſame with mine: I have indeed taken the Freedom to expoſe their Notions, as they deſerve; but without reproaching thoſe that hold 'em. There is ſcarce any thing more common, than for Perſons to maintain ſuch Principles, the neceſſary Conſequences whereof they do abominate; but either through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> they diſcern 'em not: Many through <hi>weakneſs cannot,</hi> others for <hi>want of</hi> due <hi>attention do not</hi> apprehend the Connexion there is between 'em: In both which caſes 'tis not allowable,
<pb facs="tcp:33442:3"/>
nor have we allow'd our ſelves to charge ſuch invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences upon 'em (which are not own'd, but eſpecially which are diſown'd by 'em); but to argue from 'em againſt their mistaken Principles, is what no one can reaſonably diſallow.—And this is what is Principally blam'd in our Accuſer, That he has laid us under the Imputation of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> at leaſt of <hi>Socinianizing</hi> (Crimes which we do from our very Souls deteſt!) Had he attempted to prove it, as a Conſequence upon One or Other Principle advanc'd by us, we ſhould very thankfully have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his Endeavours to undeceive us; but having ſo injuriouſly Reproach'd us, we are neceſſitated to Vindicate our ſelves; ſhould we be ſilent under the Impeachment, we ſhould too far participate in our Accuſer's guilt: That ſame Law of God not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting us to bear falſe Witneſs againſt our ſelves, which Obliges us not to do it againſt our Neighbour. But though from this very Conſideration the general Deſign of theſe Papers be Juſtifiable, that is not enough; nor yet tho the management and manner of writing be ſo too: That may be juſtifiable, that is not greatly uſeful or commendable: We have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured that the enſuing Pages may do real ſervice.</p>
            <p>In order whereunto, we have not only avoided all <hi>unbeſeeming Reflections,</hi> upon any Perſon or Party, by reaſon of their differing Sentiments from us; but have alſo studiouſly declin'd all meer <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomachies,</hi> all Contentions about meer Words and Phraſes, carefully diſtinguiſhing (upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) <hi>real</hi> from meerly <hi>Verbal</hi> Differences; and
<pb facs="tcp:33442:3"/>
as to the latter, even where the Words have been leſs Apt and Expreſſive, we have not thought Rent worthy of a Debate, being more ſollicitous to find out the Senſe in which one or other Perſon uſes them, than concern'd about Phraſes or Expreſſions on one ſide or other. And were this one Rule more univerſally obſerv'd, how greatly would it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Ending moſt of our Controverſies; not to make <hi>meer Phraſes</hi> and forms of ſpeaking, the matter of a diſpute either way; but to allow every one the liberty of their own expreſſion, provided they can but agree in ſenſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis hardly to be conceiv'd, of how pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence this one thing has been, the making <hi>neceſſary</hi> what God has never made ſo: ſhould we take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to inſtance in <hi>Self-devis'd Notions,</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (ſome,</hi> as amongſt the Papiſts, <hi>wicked and intolerable; others,</hi> almoſt amongſt all other Perſuaſions that profefs Chriſtanity, <hi>needleſs, and</hi> (at the beſt) <hi>but tolerable)</hi> which yet have been impos'd with like rigour as if all Religion had dain in 'em; how black and diſmal a Tragedy would it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce! how great a part of that Chriſtian blood, which has been ſpilt, would be found chargeable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon! But I ſhall confine my ſelf to the Point before us, the <hi>inſiſting upon Terms and Phraſes</hi> (ſuch as are meerly of Humane Stamp,) as if ſo <hi>Neceſſary</hi> that Orthodoxy in the Faith, that Chriſtianity itſelf could not ſubſiſt without 'em.</p>
            <p>Such a Spirit as this has long been growing upon the Church; and in our Accuſer it ſeems to have arriv'd to full Maturity: His whole Zeal and
<pb facs="tcp:33442:4"/>
Strength and Time is, in a manner, taken up in Collecting, and heaping together, out of various Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, certain words, and forms of ſpeaking (without any fix'd determinate ſenſe); and (though they have no certain meaning) the man will needs force ſome upon us, that we muſt by no means <hi>leave out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will fall under his Reſentments;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſet of Phraſes, we <hi>may not uſe</hi> (let our ſenſe be what it will) but, by vertue of I know not what (Papal or Patriarchal) Authority, he will ſay, <hi>we do Socinianize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this rate of magiſterialneſs does he talk, in the <hi>Preface to his Appeal, p. 3.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>If any one that comes after ſhall uſe the ſame Expreſions</hi> (meaning, <hi>the ſame</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> uſes)<hi>—I ſay</hi> (and who then dare gain-ſay it?) <hi>He does Socinianize!</hi> And immediately after (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>ſuch words,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> with others ſhall put into your <hi>Theſes)</hi>
               </q> he adds, much leſs may I be cenſur'd, though I expreſs <hi>my Reſentments</hi> againſt him, <hi>whoſoever</hi> he be, that is for leaving <hi>ſuch words</hi> out. One would have thought it had been no exceſs of modeſty, if he had, at leaſt, excepted his <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours</hi> in State, Age, Gravity, Learning and Piety: If the King ſhould Convene an Aſſembly of the moſt Pious and Judicious Biſhops and others, <hi>to draw up Theſes to avoid Socinianiſm and Arminianiſm,</hi> and they ſhould leave out <hi>ſuch Words,</hi> as this <hi>Dictator</hi> would put in, they are like (for what I ſee) to feel his <hi>Reſentments, whoſoever they be,</hi> without exception; though thoſe worthy Perſons, to whom he <hi>has Appeal'd,</hi> ſhould be amongſt 'em,
<pb facs="tcp:33442:4"/>
they are to find no favour; nay, though the <hi>King</hi> Himſelf ſhould preſide in the Aſſembly, the Beams of Majeſty will not be a ſufficient Security to Him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it is to be obſerv'd, what a mighty ſtreſs this man lays upon <hi>Words and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;</hi> theſe are all he talks of; not one Syllable about the ſenſe or meaning of 'em: Men may mean what they will, ſo they do but uſe his <hi>Phraſes;</hi> and let their meaning be never ſo ſound, they muſt not eſcape his Cenſure, unleſs they ſpeak his <hi>Words.</hi> What degree of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> he puts upon 'em, as well as what the particular <hi>Words</hi> and Phraſes are that he would impoſe, may, the better appear if we alſo caſt our eye upon the <hi>Letter</hi> he prefix'd to his late <hi>Defence:</hi> there we are told, <q>that the Phraſes are thoſe, that they of the greateſt Character for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning—have both us'd, and judg'd neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary—not only as a fence about the receiv'd Faith, and a Barrier againſt Irruptions upon common Chriſtianity:</q> 
               <hi>but as ſuch Phraſes, without which the Doctrines of Chriſt's Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and of our Juſtification could neither be Orthodoxly, nor Intelligibly expreſs'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee 'tis not enough, that <hi>He may uſe 'em</hi> himſelf, but they muſt be impos'd as <hi>Neceſſary:</hi> Nor is be ſatisfi'd, to have his <hi>Words</hi> accounted <hi>a Fence about the receiv'd Faith, a Barrier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Irruptions upon common Chriſtianity;</hi> but they muſt be admitted as the ſtandard of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy: Nothing will ſerve the turn, but they muſt be eſteem'd <hi>Neceſſary, ſo Neceſſary, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them the Doctrine of Chriſt's</hi> Satisfaction,
<pb facs="tcp:33442:5"/>
               <hi>and of our</hi> Juſtification <hi>can neither be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly,</hi> nor <hi>Intelligibly expreſs'd.</hi> And what theſe ſo invaluable <hi>Phraſes</hi> are, he tells us afterwards in his <hi>Defence</hi> it ſelf, <hi>p. 13. &amp; paſſim.</hi> They are the very ſame that run through his <hi>Appeal,</hi> viz. <hi>a Commutation,</hi> or change <hi>of Perſons</hi> between Chriſt and us; Chriſt's <hi>ſuſtaining the Perſon</hi> of Sinners, <hi>and Suffering in their Perſon;</hi> His <hi>coming under the Bond</hi> and Obligation <hi>of the Violated Law,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Forms of Speaking are not, by any means, to be omitted; we forfeit our <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> our <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> our <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> if we dare to alter 'em.</p>
            <p>And (perhaps) all the guilt of this kind does not lie at the Door of this <hi>Accuſer,</hi> and others of his way; it were well, if there were not a Participation of it on all ſides: And therefore, as one earnestly deſirous of the more Healthy and Peaceful State of the Church amongſt us, I will here adventure <hi>to lay my Hand upon the Contenders</hi> of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations; and whether they will hear, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will forbear, I will (at leaſt, ſo far as relates to the Matter in hand) interpoſe a few Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and <hi>Healing Advices.</hi>

we ought, out of how great Variety ſoever offers, to chooſe the fitteſt for our own uſe; but we are not hereupon impower'd to chooſe for, or preſcribe to <hi>others, [In theſe Words, and no other, ſhall Ye Pray to GOD, or Speak to Men,</hi> &amp;c.] Thoſe ſeem fitteſt to one Perſon, which do not ſo to another.</p>

But to draw to a Cloſe, there is one thing farther that I would add (to avoid Offence) and 'tis in Reference to the mention of Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi>'s Name, in the long Marginal Note: When I wrote what you find there, I was in hopes of his ſecond Thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Text; and the Papers were out of my Hand ſometime before I heard of his Death (I not having ſeen 'em for ſeveral Months paſt): Nor, till I ſaw it in Print, did I remember there was any thing in which he was concern'd; otherwiſe I ſhould at leaſt have ſuppreſs'd his <hi>Name,</hi> if not all that relates to him—for I cannot but be averſe to every thing that looks like trampling upon the Aſhes of the Dead.</p>

            <head>Introduction.</head>
            <p>NOT knowing whether that Right Reverend and Worthy Biſhop, or the other very Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (in the great and conſtant Cares of a more publick Nature that attend their Stations) may not account it rudeneſs for us to break in upon and diſturb 'em with our petty Quarrels; I have not thought fit ſo directly to apply to them; and for this only Reaſon it is, that I have not joyn'd in the Appeal to 'em. Their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not hereby intended to be declin'd; there being no Reaſon to fear the Iſſue ſhould they think fit to publiſh their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the World.</p>
            <p>But whether their leiſure from greater Affairs will permit 'em (or indeed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall account it worth their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) to interpoſe in this Matter, or not; the Nature of the Charge is ſuch, that (how groundleſly ſoever it be advanc'd) it is not fit to be ſilent under it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33442:10"/>
That which is apprehended more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to require that this invidious Reflection be taken notice of, is, That this way the Reputation of that moſt excellent Perſon is undermin'd, and his moſt valuable Writings (as well as the Miniſtry of thoſe that in this Matter are of his Judgment) are (ſo far as in this Accuſer lies) blaſted, and rendred odious and uſeleſs. And ſuch as either have wanted opportunity to look into the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Writings, or have not Judgment ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſtinguiſh betwixt Appearances and Realities, may be ſo far impos'd upon, by the Confidence of this Accuſer, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Charge advanc'd againſt us.</p>
            <p>For their ſakes therefore, and our own; to prevent their Guilt, as well as to preſerve our own Reputation and Uſefulneſs (and, if poſſible, alſo to undeceive this Accuſer and his Brethren) we think it fit and neceſſary that it be made appear, There is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground whereupon to Cenſure Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or (thoſe whom he calls) his Followers, as <hi>Socinians,</hi> in that Great and Important Article of Chriſt's Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>For the clearing whereof, we ſhall, with reference to the ſuſpected Paſſages, (Firſt) manifeſt their Agreeableneſs to Truth. And then ſhew the no-advantage hereby given to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now the Paſſages this Accuſer, and his Brethren, are ſo much afraid of, and griev'd at (as he pretends) we ſhall ſet together,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33442:10"/>
that we may ſee what they will in the whole amount to; and they are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſti perpeſſiones quoad rationem rei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuere malum naturale perpeſſum ex occaſione &amp; cauſalitate remota peccatorum generis humani.</hi> (He ſhould have added) <hi>&amp; proxime ex ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis &amp; conſenſus proprii obligatione.</hi> Bax. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Theol. Pars III. Cap. 1. Determ. 5. p. 38. This will be the better underſtood, if it be obſerv'd, that the Queſtion he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, was, <hi>Whether the Suffering of Chriſt was properly and formally a Puniſhment?</hi> For the Determination whereof, he does define <hi>Puniſhment</hi> (properly ſo call'd) <hi>a Natural Evil</hi> (that is, an Evil of Suffering) <hi>inflicted for, or on account of a Moral Evil (i. e.</hi> the Evil of Sin.) And (beſides other Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which he had premis'd) he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes betwixt the Suffering of the <hi>Delinquent</hi> himſelf, for his own Sin, in which caſe his Sin is <hi>directly, immediately, and per ſe,</hi> the cauſe of his Suffering; and this (he tells us) is <hi>Puniſhment</hi> in the Primary and moſt Famous Senſe of it: and the Suffering of another by reaſon of the Delinquent's fault; in which caſe, though there be a Suffering for Sin, yet that Sin is more <hi>indirectly, mediately, and per accidens</hi> the cauſe of the Suffering; and therefore though it be Puniſhment, yet 'tis only in a Secondary and Analogical Senſe to be ſo call'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33442:11"/>
And this Secondary ſort of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is two-fold; 'tis either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Voluntary;</hi> the <hi>Natural</hi> Puniſhment for another's Sin, he calls that which follows upon the nearneſs of Relation in Nature betwixt the Sufferer and the Sinner; as when Children ſuffer for their Parent's Sins; the <hi>Voluntary</hi> is, when there is a free conſent and undertaking to ſuffer on the behalf, and in the ſtead of the Sinner, though there was no previous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Sinner from whence he ſhould naturally be oblig'd to ſuffer for him.</p>
            <p>Now he does (and ſurely with very juſt Reaſon) conclude the Sufferings of Chriſt to be of this laſt kind, for that they were not the Sufferings of the Delinquent himſelf, and ſo not Puniſhment in the Primary and moſt Famous Senſe of the Word; they cou'd therefore only be <hi>Puniſhment</hi> in a Secondary and leſs proper Senſe. And ſince, even in his Aſſuming our Nature, Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd miraculouſly by the Power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt (and did not deſcend from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary Generation) therefore in that Secondary Senſe, his Puniſhment could not be the natural Effect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then, that Chriſt only was puniſh'd as a <hi>Voluntary Undertaker,</hi> and the Analogical Puniſhment He underwent was inflicted on him as a <hi>Sponſor</hi> in our ſtead; our Sins were the ground and reaſon of his Sufferings, yea
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33442:11"/>
the meritorious Cauſe (but not ſo <hi>nearly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> as they wou'd have been of our own Sufferings;) for that his Sponſion and Conſent did neceſſarily intervene; ſo that they may not unaptly be call'd Puniſhments, though not ſo fully and properly as the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Sinners themſelves might have been ſo call'd. To this Senſe does that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon ſpeak, and this is little elſe than a Tranſlation of his <hi>Latine</hi> Words, as will appear to any one that is capable and willing to conſult the place referr'd to. And this being the Subſtance of what he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards quotes from him, I ſhall need to be at no farther trouble than only to recite the Words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And thus he goes on; <hi>Peccata noſtra fuere cauſa remota paſſionis Chriſti.</hi> And again, <hi>Culpa noſtra non erat cauſa proxima ejus paſſionis, ſed tantum remota &amp; occaſio.</hi> Once more; <hi>At ſenſu improprio (i. e.</hi> not in that moſt proper and primary Senſe in which they are imputed to the Sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as may be collected from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fore-going Words) <hi>per meram Conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem dici poteſt, peccata noſtro Chriſto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putata fuiſſe, viz. quoad reatum paenae (&amp; culpae ut ad paenam, at non in ſe) id<expan>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33442:12"/>
quatenus Chriſti paſſiones fuere paenae Analogice fic dictae, peccatum (non ſuum, ſed noſtrum; non cauſam meritoriam, ſed quaſi procauſam meritoriam &amp; occaſionem) connotabant. Ibid. Determ.</hi> 7. p. 40, 41.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He quotes him again in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thus: <q>Man's Sin was an <hi>occaſion</hi> of Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as being <hi>Loco cauſae meritoriae,</hi> for properly there was no meritorious Cauſe. The Law's Curſe, or Obligation, was another occaſion, as being <hi>Miſeriae cauſa removenda.</hi> Chriſt's voluntary Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Conſent, was the moral obliging Cauſe. <hi>Univerſal Redempt.</hi> p. 7. Again, We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt Suffering <hi>Ex obligatione legis, &amp; merito peccati,</hi> as we ſhould have done if we had ſuffered our ſelves; and Suffering <hi>ex obligatione ſolius ſponſionis propriae,</hi> as Chriſt did, without any Merit, or Legal Obligation, his own Sponſion being inſtead of both, and our Sin and Obligation being but the occaſion, or <hi>Loco cauſae meritoriae,</hi> Ibid. p. 25. Again, The Law, as binding us was the great occaſion of Chriſt's Death, and <hi>Loco cauſae obligatoriae;</hi> but not the obligatory Cauſe it ſelf: Chriſt's own Sponſion, and his Father's Will, were the only proper Obligations, P. 34. Again, Chriſt did not ſuffer from the Obligation of the Law, but from the Obligation of his own Sponſion, on occaſion of the Law's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33442:12"/>
obliging us to ſuffer, P. 48. Once more, Chriſt's Sufferings had no real, proper, meritorious Cauſe; but yet Man's Sins were the <hi>pro-cauſa meritoria,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to bear that Suffering which for them was due to us (not to Him) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I ſay, He bore the Sufferings due to us, I mean it <hi>materialiter</hi> only; ſuch Sufferings for kind and weight He bore, but his Obligation to bear 'em was only from his own Sponſion, and not the Law, P. 91.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are alledg'd by the Accuſer, as ſome of thoſe Paſſages which move him and his Brethren to fear, <hi>&amp;c. Appeal,</hi> P. 4. But theſe being but <hi>ſome of 'em,</hi> he adds the reſt, P. 10. 11, 12. and what he further tranſcribes is this:</p>
            <p n="4">4. <q>We muſt not ſay that Chriſt died <hi>noſtro loco,</hi> ſo as to Perſonate us, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our Perſons in Law-Senſe, but only to bear what elſe we muſt have born, P. 51. And, As for your Objection, That <hi>no</hi> other way but Repreſenting our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cou'd ſuffice to Save us by the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of another, 'tis a groſs Miſtake, and naked Affirmation, without Proof: And for them that ſay, Chriſt ſuffer'd <hi>in perſona noſtra,</hi> but not ſatisfy'd, or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo: I Anſwer, They ſpeak Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, P. 76. To which he adds his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33442:13"/>
Explication of that Phraſe of Chriſt's Suffering <hi>loco noſtro;</hi> as it ſignifies, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that which another was oblig'd to ſuffer towards the freeing him from it; being <hi>materially</hi> the ſame, but not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> from the ſame Obligation, but from the Obligation of a voluntary Sponſion; and this not in the Name, or as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Perſon of that other, but in a Third Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Perſon of a Mediator, Redeemer, or Friend, P. 22. 23.</q> I need not mention what he next adds, for that it were exceeding ſtrange if any one ſhou'd (with this Author) Traduce a Perſon as Socinianizing, for diſtinguiſhing betwixt Chriſt's dying in our ſtead, and his dying for our good.</p>
            <p>Now to what purpoſe have we all theſe Paſſages Tranſcrib'd by him? with what deſign? what, can it be imagin'd the Man will make of 'em! (unleſs he have a mind to bring ſome of his Friends into a better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with that moſt excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.) What has he to except againſt any of the Recited Clauſes? For my part, I was not able to gueſs, what Evil it was that he wou'd charge upon 'em; nor cou'd I have been more ſurpriz'd, if any one had Cavill'd againſt the plaineſt Theorem in <hi>Euclid;</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Theſes</hi> in this Caſe, being as plainly demonſtrable (upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Principles) as any of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33442:13"/>
(upon Principles of Common Reaſon:) nor is it fit (perhaps) that any thing ſhou'd be admitted into the rank of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrines,</hi> but what is ſo. But what dangerous, what pernicious Error has he found in theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages! Why, he dreams at leaſt, that he is aware of a <hi>Deſign</hi> (bad enough, you may be ſure) <hi>againſt the Doctrine of a real, full, and proper Satisfaction to God's Juſtice for our Sins,</hi> P 4. <hi>Riſum teneatis.</hi> Well, but how muſt <hi>this Deſign</hi> be carried on? Why, don't you obſerve it, here's left out <hi>a Change of Perſons between Chriſt and us</hi> all along? I'm well aware of it; and what then? Why, and then there's not a Word of <hi>Chriſt's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining our Perſon,</hi> nor of <hi>Chriſt's Suffering in the Perſon of Sinners;</hi> and a <hi>Deſign</hi> there is on foot (I ſmell it at a diſtance) <hi>to turn [Chriſt's Suffering in the Perſon of Sinners] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to [his Suffering in the Perſon of a Mediator.]</hi> Why ſurely, though one can't yet gueſs what hurt there ſhould be in it, yet (if it be kept ſo very cloſe, as this Man's way of Expreſſion would intimate) one would be ready to ſuſpect, there was ſome ill deſign in it; but (upon further Enquiry) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there was no need of ſo great Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to find out that this was deſign'd; 'tis what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> proclaim'd openly (in the hearing of the whole World) near Fourty Four Years ago; for thus he ſpake in his <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> P. 152, 153. <hi>Chriſt, as the publick Sponſor, did bear the Puniſhment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33442:14"/>
deſerv'd by the Sins of the World, and made to his Father a</hi> Satisfaction <hi>ſufficient for the Sins of all: but this he did in the</hi> Perſon of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>that undertook to bear the Penalty, and not in the</hi> Perſon of the Elect, <hi>or of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sinner,</hi> &amp;c. Nor has he at any time ſince made a Secret of it; but upon every befitting occaſion this has ſtill been his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Language. So in the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> at the end of his <hi>Family-Book,</hi> P. 447. <hi>Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for our Sins, and in our ſtead, becauſe it was to free us from Sufferings; but yet He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in the Perſon of a Mediator, who indeed is one that undertook to ſuffer in the Sinner's ſtead, but never was, nor conſented to be eſteem'd the Sinner himſelf.</hi> And a little farther; <hi>Chriſt ſuffer'd in our ſtead, but not as our Delegate, nor in our Name and Perſon properly, but as a voluntary Mediator,</hi> &amp;c.—So alſo in his Treatiſe of <hi>Juſtifying Righteouſneſs,</hi> Part I. P. 55. <hi>Chriſt ſuffer'd and obey'd in the Perſon of the Mediator, between GOD and Man, and as a Subject to the Law of Mediation.</hi> The like again, P. 24. as indeed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Book. So in his <hi>Meth. Theol.</hi> P. III. P. 42. <hi>Chriſtus in Perſona Mediatoris paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus eſt—non in Perſona—offendente.</hi> And in his <hi>Cath. Theol.</hi> Part II. P. 38. §. 41. <hi>Chriſt did not take upon Him ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the (Natural or Civil) Perſon of any Sinner, much leſs of all the Elect, or all Sinners, but the Perſon of a Mediator between God and ſinners.</hi> See alſo §. 43. And P. 66. §. 142.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33442:14"/>
               <hi>He</hi> (God) <hi>judges Chriſt to have been the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Mediator, and in that Perſon to have done and ſuffer'd as He did; becauſe it is true: but He judges Him not to have been the Legal Perſon of the Sinner,—becauſe that is not true.</hi> It were almoſt endleſs to refer you to all the other places where he thus ſpeaks—Now after all, is it not very pleaſant, to have this Man come and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it (as if it had been ſome mighty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) <hi>That he was aware this great Man had a deſign to turn [Chriſt's ſuffering in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sinners] into [his ſuffering in the Perſon of a Mediator.]</hi> P. 12. If it be a Plot, 'tis ſurely a very innocent one, that he ſhould carry it on (for ſo many Years) ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the view of all the World; 'twas what he never was aſham'd to own; and what was known to be his Senſe of the Matter (for ought I know) before this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former was born.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, Suppoſe he was for Chriſt's Suffering <hi>in the Perſon of a Mediator,</hi> and not of <hi>Sinners,</hi> (as, though 'tis by this Accuſer only hinted as a remote Deſign, yet we have (if that will do him any kindneſs) given him very full and plain Evidence of it) what hurt is there in it?—What! why then <hi>Chriſt was never by vertue of the Sanction of the Law oblig'd to ſuffer for us;</hi> that is, as he oft tells us, the <hi>Original</hi> Law, the Law which we <hi>had tranſgreſſed</hi> did not oblige Chriſt to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33442:15"/>
ſuffer. Well, 'tis granted! pray go on; And then, <hi>He ſuffer'd not a proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment [but only the ſame Sufferings we were oblig'd to materially, not formally:]</hi> This is <hi>the Deſign</hi> he <hi>(the Reporter)</hi> was aware of, and ſo <hi>ſuggeſted</hi> it, P. 12.</p>
            <p>The Reporter (if all Reports be true) has been aware of other kind of Deſigns which yet he has not thought fit to <hi>ſuggeſt;</hi> and if he be ſo good at an Intrigue himſelf, as he is commonly fam'd to be, no wonder if he be jealous of every one elſe: It would incline one (that is of no very ſurmiſing Temper) to fear his Thoughts run much upon Deſigns and Plots when he is awake, that he cannot ſleep but he muſt Dream of 'em, and like one delirous cry out in his ſleep, Oh! they have a <hi>Deſign,</hi> a Curſed Deſign, <hi>I'm aware</hi> of what they aim at! And when he is perfectly awake, he can tell of no more that they deſign, than only <hi>to turn [Chriſt's ſuffering in the Perſon of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners] into [his ſuffering in the Perſon of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator] who was never by vertue of the Sanction of the Law, oblig'd to ſuffer for us, and who ſuffer'd not a proper Puniſhment, but only the ſame ſufferings we were oblig'd to</hi> materially, <hi>and not</hi> formally; though in his Dream he had talk'd of a <hi>Deſign againſt the Doctrine of Satisfaction.—</hi>Whereas theſe two things do ſo widely differ, as that the one may be deſign'd, where the other is not, as ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33442:15"/>
hereafter be made appear; yea, that 'tis as conſiſtent, as for a moſt ſincere <hi>Anti-Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> to be as heartily engag'd againſt <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm;</hi> and that nothing but his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can diſprove this Accuſer's being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a deſign to promote either the one or the other, <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> I mean, or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm;</hi> though whether of the two may hereafter more evidently appear, if ever he ſhould have either leſs Policy, or more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity than now.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as a Vindication of that (Not-without-juſt-veneration-to-be-Nam'd) Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and thoſe who (with my ſelf) Bleſs God for him, and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Labours, (though we, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, dare follow no one farther than he is a Follower of our Lord;) I ſay, as a Vindication of him and our ſelves, I ſhall undertake theſe Two Things in the following Papers, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove, That what is here Tranſcrib'd from Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is <hi>the Truth,</hi> that muſt ſecure us from the Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and to be abhorr'd Blaſphemy of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm:</hi> And afterwards, to make it appear, That the equally horrid Opinions (on the <hi>Socinian</hi> Extream) are (not only not-countenanc'd, but alſo) moſt effectually refell'd upon theſe Principles.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That Christ did not ſuffer by Vertue of the Law which we had Tranſgreſs'd, but only by Vertue of the Law of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THIS is ſo far from being a pernicious Error, as that it is a very Important and moſt Uſeful Truth; for the manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33442:17"/>
which I'll ſet my ſelf to hint the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Conſequents of the oppoſite Notion, and to obviate the ſeeming Reaſonings of this Accuſer againſt it.</p>
               <p>§. 1. Suppoſe we for a while that this Notion of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s is falſe, as this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer would have it; now if it be ſo, then the Propoſition contrary to it muſt needs be true; and if it were true, nothing but what is ſo could naturally and neceſſarily flow from it. We will therefore conſider ſome of the direct Conſequences of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Notion, and they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>§. 2. 1. If Chriſt did ſuffer by vertue of the violated Law, then it muſt needs be, either that he was a Violator of the Law Himſelf, or that Law muſt be disjunctive; <hi>[Thou, or thy Surety,</hi> ſhall obey, otherwiſe, <hi>Thou, or thy Surety,</hi> ſhall ſuffer.] That one of theſe Conſequents muſt be allow'd, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (with any appearance of Reaſon) be denied: He cou'd not ſuffer by vertue of that Law, unleſs He were under the reach of it; and how cou'd He be any other way under the reach of that Law, than one of theſe two:</p>
               <p>Either as having violated it Himſelf; or, being bound, when the Law was given, as a Surety in the ſame Bond with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:33442:18"/>
There is indeed a third way pretended by this Accuſer, and that is, <hi>That by his own Sponſion, and by the will of the Father, He came under the Obligation of the Violated Law, and ſo ſtood bound by this Law to ſuffer,</hi> Ap. p. 5, 6. But 'tis ſtrange, that a Perſon ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Laws, as he wou'd be thought to be, ſhou'd need to be told, that if the Obligation Chriſt laid Himſelf under to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, was as exactly the ſame, with that we lay under, as it was poſſible to be; yet the Change that was made in the Perſon oblig'd to ſuffer, did alter the <hi>Form</hi> of it, and make it truly another Law, <hi>another Obligation,</hi> and not <hi>that</hi> of the Original Law, otherwiſe than <hi>Materially</hi> only. We are willing to allow, That Chriſt ſuffer'd the ſame for Quantity and Quality that we ſhou'd have ſuffer'd, ſo far as there is but probable Proof. <hi>Baxt. of Univerſ. Redempt.</hi> p. 78, 79. But if it were moſt ſtrictly the ſame thing that we were oblig'd to, yet it is not ſufficient to prove, He ſuffer'd under the <hi>Formal Obligation of the Violated Law,</hi> or that He ſtood bound by that Law to ſuffer; for that another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may, in the ſtead of a Criminal, ſuffer the very ſame kind of Pain, or Loſs, That the Criminal himſelf was Condemn'd to, and this by his own Sponſion, and the Will of the Prince: In which caſe I dare appeal to all the Learned in the Law, whether the Obligation be not another; whether the Law by vertue whereof He ſuffers, be not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33442:18"/>
from that which Condemn'd the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that if Chriſt did (as this Accuſer of him, as well as us, ſays) ſuffer by vertue of the Violated Law; 'tis not to be conceiv'd, how the threatning of that Law cou'd reach Him, unleſs He were (as we have hinted)</p>
               <p>Either a Violater of that Law Himſelf, or an Antecedent Surety with and for us.</p>
               <p>Which either of theſe he ſhall ſay, it will equally be ſubverſive of the whole Goſpel.</p>
               <p>§. 3. (1.) Shou'd he have the Front to ſay, That <hi>Chriſt was Himſelf a Violater of that Law,</hi> what more Egregious Blaſphemy cou'd he utter againſt the Author of our Holy Religion? How ſhou'd He be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Sinners, that was a Sinner Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! The whole Goſpel does depend upon, and neceſſarily preſuppoſe his Innocency (yea, which is more, his Divinity) as the Foundation of it, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. Hell it ſelf cannot Foam out greater Rage and Nonſenſe than to call <hi>God a Sinner;</hi> and while we are ſo expreſly aſſur'd, That our Lord Jeſus was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. That <hi>He knew no ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 21. Heb. 4. 15. 1 Pet. 2. 22. 1 Joh. 3. 5. 1 Pet. 1. 19. We ſhall not ſo much as ſuſpect, that any one Profeſſing the Chriſtian
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33442:19"/>
Name will imagine, that Chriſt ſuffer'd as being a Violater of that Law Himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If then He ſuffer'd by Vertue of the Sanction of that Law, it remains that He was an <hi>Antecedent Surety</hi> with and for us; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Obligation of that Law cou'd never reach Him; and then the Law as given to <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to run <hi>[Thou ſhalt obey, or thy Surety for thee;</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>thou ſhalt die, or thy Surety for thee.]</hi> Now if the Original Law did thus take in a Surety, how plain is it, that it was never violated! Our Surety did obey, did fulfill all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if then it only oblig'd either Him, or us disjunctively to obey; what ground is there left, whereupon either Chriſt or we ſhou'd ſuffer!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I preſume ſome will allege, His Suretiſhip did only reſpect the <hi>Sanction,</hi> not the <hi>preceptive part</hi> of the Law; that the Law did not oblige Him to obey; but only (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our Diſobedience) either He or we muſt ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> To which it might be reply'd, The Surety's Name is not more Legible in the Penal; than in the Preceptive Part of the Law; and we find He did Obey, as well as Suffer; and therefore have reaſon to think He was equally oblig'd to Obey, as He was to Suffer. But yet we will ſuppoſe it to be (as they wou'd have it) that Chriſt was only
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33442:19"/>
oblig'd in caſe of our Diſobedience; that He was only a Surety with reference to the Penalty; and that the Senſe of the Law was <hi>[Thou Adam ſhalt obey, otherwiſe, thou or Chriſt, ſhall die.]</hi> And thus far at leaſt He muſt be obnoxious to the Original Law, otherwiſe He cou'd not poſſibly ſuffer under the Obligation of that Law; He cou'd not be ſaid to be (as this Accuſer wou'd have it thought He was) <hi>in the ſame Bond with us,</hi> and oblig'd to ſuffer by vertue of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſame Law that oblig'd us to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Now this Notion in the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, is equally ſubverſive of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the former,</p>
               <p>For 1. If the Original Law (as to its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Part) was disjunctive, <hi>viz.</hi> either that the Offender ſhou'd ſuffer, or Chriſt for him, then the Goſpel had not been the bringing in of <hi>a better Covenant,</hi> but a performance <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, laſt Edition,</hi> p. 14.</note> of the <hi>Old.</hi> Thus does that Right Reverend Perſon, to whom this Accuſer has Appeal'd, argue againſt him. Upon this Principle, what the Apoſtle had ſo carefully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, are confounded together, and made one and the ſame thing, when upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring 'em together, he does once and again give the Preferrence to the latter Covenant, (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22.—8. 6.) 'tis plain he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the one is not the other; or, if the Apoſtle in that Diſcourſe had a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33442:20"/>
Reference to the Moſaick Law, his Argument will hold <hi>a fortiori</hi> from hence, in reference to the Original Law. But there is one thing farther I wou'd add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head, which perhaps will be of weight with this Accuſer and his Friends, and that is, That hereupon the <hi>Goſpel muſt needs be a Law,</hi> the very Old, Original Law, and not ſo much as a Law of greater Grace; what can there poſſibly be left to diſtinguiſh the Old, Original Law, and the Goſpel, if this Principle be admitted?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Original Law (as to its Penal Part) was disjunctive, it wou'd alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That <hi>we are Juſtifiable,</hi> according to the utmoſt Rigour of that Law; for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Penalty to be already borne, what has that Law further to Charge upon us?

But upon this Suppoſal, That that Law only oblig'd either Chriſt, or us to ſuffer, what reaſon was there for ſo diſmal Apprehenſions? tho' God ſhou'd <hi>mark Iniquities,</hi> reſolve to Animadvert upon 'em with utmoſt Rigour, <hi>we may yet ſtand;</hi> for that the very rigour of the Law does (according to them) require only, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt, or we ſhou'd ſuffer, not that both ſhou'd, now then where is the danger the Pſalmiſt was ſo apprehenſive of? And whence is it, that he does elſewhere ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deprecate God's Judicial Proceſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 2. <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtify'd.</hi> It muſt needs be, either that the Pſalmiſt, or theſe Men, have very greatly miſapprehended the Senſe of that Law; for that according to him, if God ſhou'd judge us by that Law, <hi>no man</hi> living <hi>cou'd be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd;</hi> whereas according to them, though God ſhou'd judge us by that Law, we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

but be Juſtify'd;</hi> for when the threatned Penalty is inflicted, the moſt rigorous Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can go no further; we are <hi>Recti in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> when the Law is ſatisfy'd; no further charge can have place againſt us.</p>

Now then, if Chriſt was in the ſame Bond with us, if either He or we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the Debt is Paid, the utmoſt Demands of Juſtice are anſwer'd; what place is there then left for Forgiveneſs? Can a Penalty be ſaid to be forgiven, that was not due? or can it be yet due, when 'tis already paid? and is it not in Law paid, if either the Principal or Surety pay it? Upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple then it is plain, That God cannot be ſaid to have <hi>forgiven us,</hi> to have been <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to us <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33442:21"/>
with greater force and evidence, diſprove a full and proper <hi>Solution.</hi> What ſhall we then ſay to thoſe numerous Texts, where we and our Sins are ſaid to be <hi>forgiven?</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Goſpel-Covenant, as offering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. and the Sacraments of the Goſpel, as Sealing it to Sincerely Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. are render'd meer Impertinencies; and can it be thought theſe Perſons do ever pray for Pardon; or that they do account themſelves beholden to God for it? how they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with this their Opinion, I ſee not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, this Doctrine renders our Repentance, and all Obedience of our's needleſs; and a continued courſe of the moſt enormous wickedneſſes wou'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be unhurtful to us. If theſe Perſons will be conſiſtent with themſelves, it ſeems neceſſary for 'em to ſay (as Dr. <hi>Criſp)</hi> that <hi>Sin can do us no hurt, and Holineſs can do us no good.</hi> Upon this Principle, what hurt can Sin, the groſſeſt wickedneſs do us? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Perſon an Atheiſt, a Blaſphemer, an Adulterer, that he live and die ſuch; in this caſe it can only be ſaid, <hi>The Law was violated,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Threatning muſt take place:</hi> But if this Notion be true, that the Law threatens only, that either the Sinner or Chriſt ſhall die, it cannot touch ſuch a Creature as this, it having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:33442:22"/>
And alike needleſs muſt it needs render Holineſs and Obedience in all the Inſtances of it; for to what purpoſe is it, can it be ſuppos'd to be needful, if he may be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God,</hi> if he may be <hi>Rectus in curia</hi> without it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, If this Principle be admitted, <hi>none of our ſufferings</hi> wou'd conſiſt with the Juſtice of God: for that according to them, the Law did oblige only <hi>Chriſt, or us,</hi> to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; if either ſuffer therefore, full Payment is made; the Law has no farther demands to make; how is it then, that we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuffer? that we are ſubjected to any Sufferings, Spiritual or Temporal (not to make any mention here of Eternal ones) Whence is it that God with-draws the Quickning, or Comforting Influences of his Spirit from any? Whence is it, that He gives up any to their own Hearts Luſts? Whence is it that any are expos'd to the fiery Darts of the wicked one? Or yet, that the Arrows of the Almighty do wound, do ſtick faſt in any Soul? Or, if we ſhou'd yet come lower, how unaccountable were it, that we ſhou'd groan under pining Sickneſſes, noiſom Diſeaſes, racking Pains, and at length yield to Death?</p>
               <p>It will, perhaps, be pleaded, That God may inflict all theſe Evils, and many more at pleaſure, as being <hi>Abſolute Lord</hi> of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33442:22"/>
but it ſhou'd be remembred, That having given us a Law, He is become <hi>our Ruler;</hi> and thereby He does declare, That <hi>He will not,</hi> however (antecedently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) <hi>He might</hi> have Arbitrarily inflicted any Evil upon us: The very giving out a Law, in and by which it is Enacted, That ſuch certain Evils ſhall be inflicted upon the Tranſgreſſors of it; how plainly does it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifie-the Non-violaters of it from ſuch Sufferings? Such Threatnings otherwiſe cou'd anſwer no End; if it were intended, That whether they violated the Law, or not, they ſhou'd be alike obnoxious. Now if we conſider God as a <hi>Governour,</hi> the Evils He inflicts come under another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; they are not meerly Afflictions or Sufferings, but they are alſo <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> and therefore they are not diſpens'd Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, but according to a Stated Rule; He does not puniſh any but ſuch as by the Law are obnoxious; hence is it that we read of his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in Reference to this Matter.</p>
               <p>And as this does more generally evince, That all Evils inflicted by a <hi>Ruler</hi> as ſuch, are Puniſhments; ſo (with Reference to the particular Inſtances above-mention'd) it might be diſtinctly made appear, that <hi>they are,</hi> in the moſt ſtrict and proper Senſe, <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments—</hi>In the laſt (which is not the leaſt doubted) Caſe, how plain is it! that the Separation of Soul and Body is Penal; that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33442:23"/>
'tis a <hi>natural Evil</hi> no one doubts, as ſuch 'tis abhorr'd of all; and that 'tis inflicted <hi>for,</hi> or by reaſon of <hi>Sin,</hi> is as unqueſtionable, if the Apoſtle's account of the Matter may be allow'd; for ſo he tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>By one man ſin enter'd into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinn'd.</hi> So that <hi>Death</hi> (amongſt Men) has the nature of a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> in it, but how then comes it to be inflicted, if it be <hi>not due?</hi> If we be not obnoxious to the Sentence of the Law, it cannot be ſaid to be due to us; if the Threatning was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, both Parties Bound cou'd not be obnoxious, if Sentence be executed on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other is clear; how comes it then that we are puniſh'd and Chriſt too! <hi>What ſhall we ſay? Is God unrighteous that taketh vengeance?</hi> Rom. 3. 5. Or is not this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>unrighteous Doctrine,</hi> that wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the Imputation of Injuſtice upon the Holy God?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet again, According to this Notion, How can the Eternal Damnation of any Soul conſiſt with Divine Juſtice? This Surety is a Puniſhment with a witneſs; but how can it be a <hi>righteous one</hi> if it be not due? And it cannot be due to any Man, if it be already paid; and every Man has paid it, if his Surety have done it. I ſee not, upon this Principle, how God can, in Juſtice, Damn any individual Soul: Here
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33442:23"/>
then is <hi>Univerſal Redemption,</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> beyond the utmoſt ſtretch of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> it ſelf. What! is it then not only <hi>poſſible that they may,</hi> but is it alſo <hi>certain that all ſhall</hi> be Sav'd from Everlaſting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! Is there not only a <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of Grace afforded to all, but that <hi>Efficacious</hi> Influence that will ſecure the Effect! Is God not only <hi>unwilling</hi> to Damn any, but is He alſo <hi>unjuſt,</hi> unrighteous if He do! 'Tis ſtrange then, that we ſhould read of a <gap reason="foreign">

7. I'll add but one more abſurd Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Opinion (though many more might be ſubjoyn'd) and that is, That the Patrons of this Principle do hereby greatly obſcure, and leſſen that <hi>Free-Grace in Chriſt,</hi> which they ſo highly pretend to <hi>Exalt</hi> and Magnifie. When they have ſeem'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <hi>Free-Grace</hi> beyond all others, to cry up <hi>Goſpel-Grace,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel-Preaching,</hi> they do at length ſubvert all <hi>Purely-Goſpel-Grace</hi> at once, and neceſſarily reſolve the Whole of Divine Grace into the Conſtitution of the <hi>Law of Works:</hi> For, ſuppoſing (with them) that Chriſt's Name was put into the Original Bond; ſuppoſing that Law did take in Chriſt as Surety with us; 'tis not of <hi>Grace,</hi> but Juſtice, that God is reconcil'd to us, or that we are accepted with Him; it ſhou'd not be ſaid that we are <hi>Juſtify'd freely by his Grace,</hi> but that the Rigour of the Law did exact nothing more, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Juſtification was a <hi>due debt,</hi> 'twas what was owing to us by Governing Juſtice; the Righteous God cou'd not Condemn us, having already exacted the threatned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at our Surety's Hands. Now is it ſo Adorable, ſo Surprizing <hi>Grace,</hi> that God ſhou'd be juſt to his own Law! Is it ſo very Aſtoniſhing and Wonderful a thing, that God ſhou'd be true to his Word! Thus, after all their Pretences of a more exalted Admiration of, and Value for <hi>Divine Grace,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:33442:24"/>
they do by this Notion ſhrink it into ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Compaſs, as the Framing the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law; and as for all that which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel magnifies as <hi>Grace,</hi> they render it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing other than <hi>pure Juſtice;</hi> all <hi>Goſpel Grace</hi> ſhou'd (with them, if they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with themſelves) be nothing differing from a <hi>due Debt,</hi> tho' the Apoſtle does ſo carefully contra-diſtinguiſh and oppoſe 'em to each other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>§ 5. (2.) If Chriſt did ſuffer by Vertue of the violated Law, then his Sufferings were moſt <hi>ſtrictly the ſame</hi> that we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to; this is as plain, as that the Sanction of the Law was the ſame with it ſelf. But is it to be admitted, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>alienated from the Life and Love of God!</hi> that He was <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins! deſerted of the Spirit of Holineſs! was his Soul over-run with outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impetuous Luſts!</hi> All which, under one conſideration, is our Puniſhment, tho' under another reſpect it be alſo our Sin. Or was the Lord Jeſus <hi>hated, abhorr'd of the Father!</hi> Did He <hi>loſe all right to, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God's Favour and Kindneſs?</hi> Did He <hi>bear the ſtinging Reflections of a guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the horrors of a deſpairing damned wretch in Hell?</hi> This is but part of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment included in the Threatning againſt us; but what Pious Soul wou'd not riſe with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt any one, that ſhou'd ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33442:25"/>
far Blaſpheme the Holy and ever-bleſſed Redeemer, as to ſay this was his Caſe, his State? And if He did not ſuffer what that Law threatned, it cannot be ſaid that He ſuffer'd by vertue of that Law. It remains then, that He did only ſuffer by vertue of the Law of Mediation, as before.</p>
               <p>§. 6. (3.) Then the Law oblig'd him to ſuffer; whereupon it wou'd follow, that neither He cou'd refuſe the Undertaking; nor God refuſe to accept it as Puniſhment; but this I ſhall but mention here.</p>
               <p>§. 7. We are next to obviate the ſeeming Reaſonings of this Accuſer againſt this Truth; and what he does looſely (and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodically enough) offer here and there to this purpoſe, we ſhall endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into ſome Order, that it may appear, with all the force it has, againſt us; and be more capable of receiving a juſt Reply. And,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He does inſinuate, That Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings <hi>cannot otherwiſe be an Act of Rectoral Juſtice; but only Acts of Obedience and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi> Take his own Words: <q>We are of Opinion, That <hi>Sufferings</hi> which are not from the <hi>Obligations of a Violated Law,</hi> cannot be an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Rectoral Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> which does Eſſentially reſpect the <hi>Law</hi> in its Diſtributions.—If a <hi>Rector</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenceth

               </p>
               <p>And again, <q>If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> reſolve Chriſt's <hi>Sufferings</hi> wholly into a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Precept</hi> of the <hi>Mediatorial Law,—</hi>they can be but <hi>Acts of Obedience</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> not Acts of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> p. 50, 51.</q> So he goes on, p. 52. <q>They affirm 'em to be but <hi>Acts of Obedience,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Acts of Dominion,</hi> not of <hi>Punitive Juſtice.</hi>
                  </q> So again, p. 54. The Sufferings of Chriſt—<q>cou'd not be a <hi>Judicial Act of God:</hi> He (Chriſt) cou'd not be Condemn'd, nor cou'd Sentence paſs upon Him; nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Sentence cou'd He be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; for where no Obligation to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by the Sanction of the Law, there no <hi>Guilt</hi> in any Senſe; where no Guilt, no Condemning, no Paſſing a Sentence juſtly, no Execution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And P. 56. His Sufferings cou'd be but an <hi>Act of Dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to all this we Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That He is ſo <hi>Confus'd,</hi> and <hi>Unſteady</hi> in the Forming this Objection, that we can hardly ſo much as gueſs what it is he means: Sometimes he ſpeaks of the Sufferings of Chriſt as an <hi>Act</hi> of Rectoral Juſtice, and a Judicial <hi>Act</hi> of God; where one wou'd think he conſiders 'em <hi>as inflicted by God;</hi> and yet in other places, he ſpeaks of 'em as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33442:26"/>
                  <hi>Acts of Juſtice,</hi> where 'tis not certain, but he may refer to 'em <hi>as undertaken by Chriſt:</hi> Now theſe two are far from being the ſame thing, That Chriſt was not unrighteous in undertaking, and undergoing thoſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and that God was not unrighteous in inflicting and laying 'em upon Him.</p>
               <p>Again, he thus confounds, an <hi>Act of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of Dominion; whereas the former may import, That the Father (as <hi>Dominus Chriſti,</hi> as his Lord) might enjoyn Him to ſuffer; and the latter may ſignifie, That Chriſt (as <hi>Lord of his own Acts)</hi> might offer, might conſent to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he confounds Sufferings inflicted <hi>by vertue of the Sanction of the Law,</hi> and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings inflicted, <hi>with a regard to Sin,</hi> and makes the latter ſignifie as much as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whereas we conſtantly (and with the juſteſt Reaſon) diſtinguiſh betwixt 'em; and allow that in the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Chriſt, there was a regard had to <hi>Sin,</hi> to <hi>our Sin,</hi> as what had offended, highly incens'd the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty againſt us, and render'd it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (for the Reputation of his Wiſdom, Holineſs, Juſtice, and the ſupport of his Governing-Authority) that his Diſpleaſure ſhou'd in one way or other be manifeſted againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> if He ſhou'd (and that He might) remit the Penalty due to the <hi>Sinner.</hi> And hereupon it was agreed betwixt the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33442:26"/>
Father and the Son, that Chriſt ſhou'd <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;</hi> the Divine Wiſdom this way at once providing for the Honour of God, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and for the Redemption of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate-Man. So that we readily grant, there was a <hi>reſpect had to ſin,</hi> in the Sufferings of Chriſt; yea, that it cou'd not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with the Juſtice of God as Rector, to Sentence Him to ſuffer, without a <hi>regard to ſin.</hi> But it does not, cannot thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that He ſuffer'd by <hi>vertue of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Violated Law;</hi> that that Law oblig'd Him to ſuffer; unleſs you will alſo ſay, That that Law oblig'd God to Save Sinners, and to appoint this Ranſom for 'em. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſing him to mean (as his Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Letter wou'd intimate) That unleſs we will allow Chriſt's <hi>Sufferings</hi> to have been by vertue of the <hi>violated Law,</hi> they cou'd not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God as a <hi>Ruler,</hi> but only as an <hi>abſolute Lord.</hi> We deny the Conſequence: neither is it to be allow'd, unleſs he can make it appear, that this is the <hi>only Law,</hi> by vertue whereof Chriſt cou'd be oblig'd to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>And therefore alſo, it might be (and was) a <hi>Judicial Act</hi> of God, an Act of his <hi>Rectoral Juſtice</hi> to inflict Sufferings upon Chriſt, becauſe the <hi>Law of Mediation</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33442:27"/>
him obnoxious to Sufferings: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hence <hi>oblig'd</hi> to ſuffer (and, in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Senſe, having <hi>guilt</hi> upon Him) He might have Sentence juſtly paſs'd and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon Him; and accordingly we find (in that Prophetical Pſalm, 22. 3.) Chriſt Juſtifies God the Father under the very depth of his Sorrows.</p>
               <p>Nay, Chriſt's Sufferings did not only <hi>conſiſt</hi> with the Juſtice of God as a Rector; but did alſo <hi>declare</hi> and demonſtrate it to the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26.

As we ſhall (God willing) more fully clear, when we come to deal with the <hi>Socinian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

Whereas he argues from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Acts of Obedience</hi> (in our Opinion) that conſequently we muſt hold, that they are only <hi>Acts of Dominion, &amp;c.</hi> We again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Conſequence; nay, rather think the direct oppoſite ſhou'd have been inferr'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe we do conſider the Sufferings of Chriſt, as <hi>Acts of Obedience</hi> to a Law, therefore God is not, in reference hereto, to be look'd upon as a meer <hi>Lord</hi> or Owner, but alſo as a <hi>Ruler.</hi>

And we are the leſs afraid of having any ill conſequence prov'd upon us, as to this, becauſe (which yet this Accuſer, as if he very little convers'd with the Scriptures, ſeems not to know) 'tis conſecrated <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> as well as <hi>Divine Truth;</hi> 'tis not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but alſo the <hi>words</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. So that the Sufferings of Chriſt were <hi>Acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and conſequently we may infer, did correſpond to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of a Law, and what other could it be but that of <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Accordingly, in reference to theſe very Sufferings, our Saviour himſelf tells us, That he acted herein purſuant to a <hi>Command he had receiv'd of his Father, John</hi> 10. 17, 18. He ſays not, this I was oblig'd to by the <hi>threatning</hi> of one or other Law; but <hi>a Command</hi> I have received to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and I'm ready to obey; for thus alſo <hi>in the Volum of the Book it is written</hi> of him, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God;</hi> for to the <hi>offering of his Body,</hi> the Apoſtle does apply thoſe words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7—10.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) And laſtly, To cloſe this head, we add, That if indeed we had ſaid, that the Sufferings of Chriſt had <hi>no reſpect at all to the violated Law,</hi> he might then (with ſome force of Reaſon) have inferr'd upon us, that we thereby render'd 'em, with the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> a meer <hi>Act of Dominion</hi> upon Chriſt, and not (in any ſenſe) an <hi>Act of

The <hi>Law,</hi> as obliging us to ſuffer, was the <hi>Ground</hi> the Reaſon of <hi>Christ's</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to ſuffer; but his <hi>Sufferings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were by reaſon of that <hi>Undertaking;</hi> had it not been that we were under ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death by that Law, we had not needed a Mediator; Nay further, could that Sentence have been remitted without any <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made; Could the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have been abſolutely recall'd (ſo as that no ſevere Marks of Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould have been left upon Sin) and this without weakning his Authority, and rendring the Majeſty of Heaven cheap: Chriſt had never ſuffer'd, never undertaken to ſuffer—But theſe things are vaſtly differing; to ſay that <hi>upon this Reaſon</hi> Chriſt undertook to ſuffer; and to ſay, that <hi>that very Sanction</hi> oblig'd him to ſuffer; in the former Caſe, 'tis no more than <hi>loco cauſae Obligatoriae;</hi> in the latter, it would be the <hi>Obligatory Cauſe it ſelf.</hi>

(2.) Chriſt's Sufferings did, in great part anſwer the <hi>Ends of that Sanction;</hi> as will appear, if we conſider for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a Sanction was added to the Law; and amongſt others, ſuch as theſe do readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occur, <hi>viz.</hi> thereby to <hi>expreſs God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin;</hi> to <hi>ſecure the Law and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver from Contempt;</hi> and to <hi>enforce Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe Ends of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were anſwer'd as well (perhaps bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) by the Sufferings of Chriſt, than they could have been by the ſufferings of Sinners themſelves. Yet it cannot therefore be ſaid, that the <hi>Threatning it ſelf</hi> was executed upon Chriſt. In ſhort, ſome reſpect the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt had to the violated Law, as is above ſaid, but not <hi>ſuch,</hi> as that it can be ſaid with Truth, either that that Law oblig'd Him to ſuffer, or that it was fulfill'd in and by his Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He does next Inſinuate, As if <hi>Chriſt cou'd not be a Mediator,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>not ſuffer as ſuch;</hi> unleſs He ſuffer'd by Vertue of the Violated Law. This (ſurely) muſt be his Senſe, if he have any, P. 25. where he ſays, <q>That though Chriſt came not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obligation of the Law of Works, but by the Father's Will, and his own Conſent—Yet (on his Entring into the Office of a Mediator) the Obligation to ſuffer for Sin, is immediately by Vertue of the Sanction of the Law.</q> I take him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33442:29"/>
to mean, That tho' He was not a Mediator, without the Appointment of God, and his own Conſent, yet upon his very becoming a Mediator, the Obligation of the violated Law muſt immediately lay hold upon Him; ſo that tho' He might have avoided Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had He declin'd his Mediatory Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; yet ſuppoſing Him to Mediate, the Violated Law immediately ſeizeth on Him, and obliges Him to ſuffer. To which we Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Violated Law did indeed oblige the Sinner himſelf to ſuffer; but that it did or cou'd oblige any one elſe, is what (how oft ſoever it be ſaid) has never yet been prov'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor does Chriſt's meerly entring into the Office of a Mediator, neceſſarily (and in the nature of the thing) oblige Him to ſuffer; for it is conceivable, (as a thing very poſſible) that He might have Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a mitigation of our Sufferings only. Suppoſe (for inſtance) that inſtead of the Torments of Hell for ever, we might only endure thoſe Tortures for a determinate Number of Years. I would not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: I am not ſaying Chriſt did ſo, being well aſſur'd He did otherwiſe; nor am I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing a better Method, or one equally good with that which took place: 'Tis not without inexpreſſible Delight and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33442:29"/>
that I do own and adore the Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excelling Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that is conſpicuous in the Goſpel-way of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All I ſay is, That in the nature of the thing 'twas not impoſſible, there might have been a Mediation ſet on foot to this purpoſe; in which caſe I ask, how it does appear, that the Mediator Himſelf muſt needs ſuffer? And this with a deſign to convince <hi>Our Accuſer,</hi> his Argument can have no force in it; for that it muſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Rules of Logick, proceed upon this Indefinite and Unlimitted Propoſition, <hi>Whoever Mediates for an obnoxious Criminal, ſhall ſuffer.</hi> Which Propoſition is not to be allow'd, unleſs every one that Mediates <hi>(in what way ſoever)</hi> for ſuch an one muſt needs ſuffer: An Aſſertion ſo weak, that barely to mention it is ſufficiently to expoſe it; yet if he ſhou'd limit it to this, or any other ſpecial Caſe, 'twould there only be a naked Aſſertion, and no Argument.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſing Chriſt was (as I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant he was) upon his entring into the Office of a Mediator oblig'd to ſuffer for Sin; yet ſtill, it appears not that He is ſo, <hi>immediately</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Sanction of the Law.</hi> That the Sufferings of the Mediator had a <hi>Reſpect</hi> to the Sanction of the Law (as before) we grant; but that He was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>oblig'd</hi> by that Law to ſuffer (whether mediately, or immediately) is what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33442:30"/>
this Accuſer can never prove. The violated Law never ſaid, <hi>If Chriſt Mediate for Sinners, He ſhall die;</hi> but another Law that was peculiar to Himſelf, and which we therefore call the <hi>Law of Mediation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) But he proceeds, <q>If Chriſt's Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Suffer did not reſult from this Law <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Violated Law) <hi>our ſins were not the Impulſive Cauſe</hi> of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 25. And he adds, p. 41. It's impoſſible Sin ſhou'd be their <hi>Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Cauſe. And again, p. 50. If Chriſt's Sufferings be not—by vertue of the Penal Sanction of a violated Law, our Sins cannot be their Meritorious Cauſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer to this we muſt defer to the <hi>Fourth Chapter,</hi> where we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak fully to it. Again,</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) He does alſo ſuggeſt, in the laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pages, That <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings cou'd not otherwiſe be a proper Puniſhment—</hi>The Conſideration whereof is alſo to be reſerv'd for the <hi>Fifth Chapter</hi> of this Diſcourſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) He does next intimate, That <hi>it was either by vertue of that Sanction (i. e.</hi> that of the Violated Law) <hi>or by vertue of no Sanction at all, that Chriſt was oblig'd to ſuffer:</hi> For
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33442:30"/>
that according to us, the <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Law had <hi>no</hi> Penal <hi>Sanction;</hi> and thereupon he challenges us to ſhew, by <hi>vertue of what Sanction</hi> Chriſt was oblig'd to ſuffer, <hi>Vid.</hi> p. 26. In Anſwer whereto,</p>
               <p>We diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Sanction
<list>
                     <item>In a more Looſe and General Senſe;</item>
                     <item>In a more Strict and Proper one.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly we ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the ſtricteſt Senſe, as it does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>the Threatning that is annex'd to a Law,</hi> we ſee not how it can be ſaid, that Chriſt was oblig'd to Suffer by vertue of <hi>any San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> for that we know no Law that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Him. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we underſtand the Word in a looſer and more general Senſe, as ſignifying only an <hi>Ordination</hi> at large; we may ſay, <hi>Sanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fuit,</hi> it was Ordain'd, Enacted by the Law of Mediation, that He ſhou'd ſuffer for Sin; and ſo He was oblig'd to ſuffer by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that <hi>Sanction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In the laſt place, He does advance a very formidable Argument againſt us, <hi>viz.</hi> That (upon the fore-mention'd Principle) we cannot hold Chriſt's Sufferings to have been <hi>in our place and ſtead,</hi> otherwiſe than as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33442:31"/>
it ſignifies only <hi>for our Benefit</hi> and Advantage. This he inlarges upon, p. 29, 30.</p>
               <p>To which we Reply, <hi>Firſt,</hi> and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, That all that make uſe of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, are not agreed upon one and the ſame Senſe; and therefore the Senſe of the Terms ſhou'd be fix'd, before they can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing in an Argument. 'Tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſuch a Senſe may be affix'd to one, or other of the Terms, in which it may be true, that we cannot hold Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to have been <hi>in our place and ſtead,</hi> or to have been otherwiſe ſo, than as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>for our good.</hi> Who knows what Secret Senſe this Accuſer may underſtand theſe Phraſes in, by which he may prove his charge againſt us.</p>
               <p>We ſhou'd therefore know, what it is he means, both by Chriſt's Suffering <hi>in our place and ſtead,</hi> and by his Suffering <hi>for our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage:</hi> For by knowing only his Senſe of one of theſe Phraſes, we cannot poſſibly Conjecture, whether the other (with him) import leſs or more, or juſt the ſame thing. Yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2. And more <hi>particularly,</hi> tho' we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (in his declar'd Senſe) hold that Chriſt ſuffer'd <hi>in our place,</hi> yet it will not follow, that we do not (or cannot) hold that He
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33442:31"/>
ſuffer'd <hi>in our ſtead,</hi> otherwiſe than as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>for our good</hi> only. But what we do, (and conſiſtently with our ſelves can) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Suffering <hi>in our ſtead,</hi> in ſuch a Senſe in which the <hi>Socinians</hi> ever deny'd it, ſhall (thro' Divine Aſſiſtance) be made appear in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THIS alſo he would have to be accounted amongſt our Errors, as appears not only from ſeveral Paſſages in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> but alſo from his objecting this, amongſt other faults, againſt the <hi>Third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> (in his <hi>Report)</hi> viz. <hi>That it was ſo word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to be calculated to their Meridian, who hold, That Chriſt ſuffer'd only in the Perſon of a Mediator, not in the Perſon of Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. That Chriſt was a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and did ſuffer as (or in the Perſon of) a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, I will ſuppoſe is no part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt the Accuſer and us: All that can then remain as queſtionable, is, Whether he ſuffer'd as (or in the Perſon of) a Sinner—which being affirm'd, ſhou'd alſo have been prov'd by this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer: We being only Doubters or Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this Point, have nothing to do but only to hear his Proofs: No Rules I have yet met with, oblige us to any thing more.</p>

§. 3. Yet ſince he has not (as might have been expected) done his part; or perhaps, could not do it; we ſhall more than do our own; that it may appear, what it is we do herein deny, and upon what Reaſons we do it. And</p>
               <p>§. 4. In order to a better underſtanding the ſtate of the Caſe, it ſhould be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Phraſe it ſelf is what the Scriptures are utterly a Stranger to: We no where read in thoſe ſacred Oracles, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt's ſuſtaining, or ſuffering in <hi>the Perſon of Sinners;</hi> and 'tis but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us, when Articles of Faith are propos'd to, nay preſs'd upon us, to heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate about 'em (can we be blam'd, if we alſo deny, renounce 'em) unleſs Scripture-Evidence be produc'd for 'em. If their ſenſe of this (or any other) Phraſe appear in the Scriptures, we ſhall readily own that ſenſe; <hi>but the Phraſe it ſelf cannot be thought neceſſary, while it is not there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. But beſides, This is not only an Humane Phraſe, but a very obſcure and ambiguous one; and 'tis hard to conceive (amongſt the many ſenſes it is capable of) any one ſenſe, in which it may be tolerably apply'd to the preſent Caſe—We ſhall briefly mention ſome of the more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Notations of the Word <hi>[Perſon:]</hi> And paſſing by ſeveral others, I ſhall only take
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33442:33"/>
notice of the vaſtly differing ſenſe in which the Word is us'd by <hi>Metaphyſicians,</hi> and by <hi>Civilians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. The word <hi>[Perſon]</hi> as made uſe of by <hi>Metaphyſicians,</hi> is deſign'd to expreſs <hi>an individual, compleat; intelligent Subſtance.</hi> Thus every Man, and every Angel are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Perſons; and Chriſtian Philoſophers transfer this account of the word <hi>[Perſon]</hi> to Chriſt as God-Man; yea, and to the God-Head it ſelf, when they uſe that Term with reference to the Sacred Three, <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> But in this ſenſe 'tis not to be admitted, that Chriſt ſuffer'd in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Sinners; for that in order to his ſuffering in any <hi>Perſon</hi> (one or other) it was firſt neceſſary he ſhould aſſume that Perſon; Now, however he did aſſume the Nature of Man, yet he did not, 'twas not poſſible that he ſhould, in this ſenſe, aſſume the <hi>Perſon</hi> of any Sinner. Surely this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer himſelf will not dare to aſſert, That Chriſt was the individual Subſtance of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Judas, &amp;c.</hi> if not, he was not their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and if not their Perſon, then he did not ſuffer as ſuch.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Or if they ſhould refer us to <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> for the ſenſe of the word, 'tis amongſt them a very perplex'd and un-agreed Term.

               <p>§. 9. But amongſt <hi>Political Perſons</hi> (to omit other Sub-diviſions) there is one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial kind, which they call <hi>Repreſentative
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33442:34"/>
Perſons;</hi> and this I ſuppoſe may be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when 'tis ſaid, That Chriſt ſuffer'd in the Perſon of Sinners. Under this rank the Civilians do commonly reckon <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, Plenipotentiaries, Vice-Roys,</hi> &amp;c. as acting in the Perſon of the Prince that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionates 'em: <hi>Members of Parliament,</hi> as Perſonating or Repreſenting thoſe that do Elect 'em: <hi>Advocates or Attorneys,</hi> as Pleading in the Perſon of their Clients: <hi>Tutors and Guardians,</hi> acting for, and in the Name of the Pupils and Minors, with whom they are entruſted: <hi>a Servant,</hi> or any other <hi>Delegate,</hi> whom we Authoriſe and Appoint to pay Money, or Tranſact any other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair for us; ſo far as any one does with Authority manage any of our Affairs, he may in ſome Senſe be ſaid to <hi>Repreſent</hi> us, or to do it <hi>in our Perſon.</hi> Now if in any tolerable Senſe it may be ſaid, That Chriſt ſuffer'd in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Sinners, it muſt (I conceive) be in this, that He did ſuffer as their <hi>Repreſentative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. And therefore, that it may the better appear, how far He did, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He did not Repreſent, or perſonate us in his Sufferings, we ſhould carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Betwixt Chriſt's <hi>Repreſenting us</hi> in his <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and repreſenting us in his <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:33442:35"/>
2. Betwixt his Repreſenting, or <hi>Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Sinner</hi> in his Sufferings, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting or <hi>Perſonating Sinners</hi> therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Betwixt his Repreſenting, or <hi>Perſonat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners</hi> when He ſuffer'd, only in ſome very limited and <hi>reſtrain'd Senſe;</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting 'em therein <hi>ſimply and abſolutely.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 11. Whereupon I add, I. He did not ſo far Repreſent, or Perſonate Sinners in his <hi>Holineſs and Obedience,</hi> as in his <hi>Sufferings;</hi> 'tis (as we ſhall immediately ſhew) in ſome Senſe allowable to ſay, Chriſt <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> in the Perſon of a Sinner, or Sinners; but I know no Senſe in which it may be ſaid, That He <hi>obey'd</hi> in the Perſon of a Sinner, or Sinners. He did not Perſonate a Sinner, much leſs Sinners, in his ſinleſs Obedience; this were as groſly abſurd (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf <note place="margin">Treatiſe of <hi>Juſtif. Righteouſ.</hi> Part I. p. 58.</note> hints) as it would be to ſay, <hi>In the Perſon of Sinners He never ſinned.</hi> Now this we the rather take notice of, becauſe this Accuſer extends Chriſt's Perſonating us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, and equally, to both his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and his Sufferings; for thus he ſpeaks
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33442:35"/>
in his late <hi>Defence,</hi> p. 28. <hi>Chriſt's thus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and obeying in the Perſon of Sinners, it is to all intents and purpoſes as effectual, as if they did it themſelves.</hi> And what any <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine</hi> or <hi>Antinomian</hi> wou'd ſay more than this, I know not; or which way he will <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, make this conſiſt with the neceſſity of Faith and Repentance, in order to our actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diſcharge from Puniſhment (which yet he largely aſſerts, <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 8. 9.) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine.</p>
               <p>§. 12. II. It is more allowable to ſay, That Chriſt ſuffer'd in the <hi>Perſon of a Sinner,</hi> than that He ſuffer'd in the <hi>Perſon of Sinners:</hi> for that the former of theſe ſignifies no more, than that He <hi>ſuffer'd as a Sinner.</hi> Now that may be ſuppos'd to intimate, either that Chriſt, in the inflicting Sufferings upon Him, was <hi>dealt with like a Sinner;</hi> or alſo, that therein He was <hi>reputed</hi> and declar'd <hi>a Sinner,</hi> ſuffer'd under that Imputation and Charge: And both theſe are true; the <hi>former,</hi> whether we conſider Him as ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Hand of God or Men; and even the <hi>latter</hi> alſo, ſo far as Men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in 'em; He died by their Sentence as a Blaſphemer.</p>
               <p>§. 13. III. Yet in a very <hi>Limited and reſtrain'd Senſe</hi> it may be ſaid, That Chriſt <hi>ſuffer'd in the Perſon of Sinners;</hi> that is, ſo far as that He ſuffer'd <hi>in our room and ſtead,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:33442:36"/>
He ſtood before God as an Undertaker to <hi>ſuffer for our ſins,</hi> and accordingly became a <hi>Sacrifice for us:</hi> If any one will ſay He was our Repreſentative, or ſuffer'd in our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus far, I ſhall not contend with him. Nor would Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> neither, as is plain from ſuch Paſſages as theſe—<q>When we are agreed, That the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Sponſor,</hi>

Mediator, ſo far <hi>(limitedly)</hi> to bear the <hi>Perſon of a ſinner,</hi> and to ſtand in the place of the Perſons of all Sinners, as to bear the Puniſhment they deſerv'd, and to ſuffer for their Sin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I'll mention but one more, though there be ſeveral other Paſſages to this purpoſe—<q>It belongs to Him (Chriſt) as Mediator, to undertake the Sinner's Puniſhment in his own Perſon; and if any will impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call that, the <hi>Perſonating</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of the <hi>ſinner,</hi> let 'em limit it, and confeſs that it is <hi>not ſimply,</hi> but <hi>in tantum,</hi> ſo far, and to ſuch uſes, and no other; and that yet Sinners did it not in and by Chriſt, but only Chriſt for them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Benefits as He pleas'd; and then we delight not to quarrel about meer Words, though we like the Phraſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture better.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. IV. So far as He did Repreſent, or Perſonate us in his Sufferings; He did it <hi>not as our Deputy,</hi> or Delegate; we did not order, nor could we authorize Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; not being capable either of obliging Him to ſuffer, or of impowering Him in ſuch Sufferings to repreſent us, and ſtand in our ſtead: But, He voluntarily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuffer for us, <hi>God authoriz'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Him</hi> thereunto; and from that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment his Sufferings become ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious for us; and therefore from thence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33442:37"/>
it is, from that Appointment of God, that it muſt be adjuſted <hi>how far,</hi> and <hi>to what ends and uſes,</hi> He ſhou'd ſuffer as the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or in the Perſon of Sinners; and in <hi>what way</hi> and <hi>method,</hi> and <hi>upon what terms</hi> his Sufferings ſhou'd be of Saving Benefit and Effect to 'em. Chriſt did not repreſent us <hi>as far</hi> as we pleaſe; or <hi>to what ends and uſes we pleaſe;</hi> nor will his Sufferings be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Saving to us in <hi>what way and method</hi> we pleaſe, upon <hi>any,</hi> or <hi>no terms,</hi> as we think fit; but all this is (according to Divine Pleaſure) unalterably Determin'd and Fix'd, by that Appointment and Law of God, by which it was alſo ordain'd, That Chriſt our Mediator ſhou'd be Sacrific'd for us. He cou'd not <hi>Perſonate us</hi> farther than He was allow'd and impower'd of God; and how far therefore his Commiſſion did extend, or with what Limitations it was attended, is only to be Collected from the Oracles of God; ſo far then, as it ſhall appear by the Sacred Scriptures, that Chriſt <hi>ſuffer'd in the Perſon of ſinners,</hi> or as their Repreſentative, we ſhall readily agree, and no farther.</p>
               <p>§. 15. V. and Laſtly, The Veneration we have for thoſe Sacred Oracles, will not admit us <hi>(without any limitation)</hi> to ſay, as this Accuſer does, that Chriſt ſuffer'd <hi>as the Repreſentative,</hi> or <hi>in the Perſon of ſinners:</hi> The Reaſons whereof will the better appear, if it be firſt agreed what is the exact and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33442:37"/>
Notion of ſuch a Perſon, a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Perſon: and in this Matter, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, our Accuſer is not unwilling (and for my part, I am moſt willing) that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Pufendorf</hi> ſhou'd be our Inſtructer. This therefore is the account he gives us of it, <hi>Peculiaris ſpecies</hi> Perſonarum <hi>politica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt, quas dicere poſſis</hi> Repreſentativas, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. lib.</hi> 1, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. §. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ideo quod Perſonam aliorum referant: quae ſcil. poteſtate &amp; authoritate agendi ab aliquo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructae, hujus vice negotia expediunt eodem cum effectu, ac ſi ab illo ipſo eſſent confecta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that according to him (and indeed according to the truth of the thing) ſo far as any one is allow'd to Repreſent another, they are both in Law reputed <hi>one Perſon;</hi> and thereupon, whatever he has, does, or ſuffers as a Repreſentative, it is <hi>(eodem cum effectu, i. e.</hi> as this Accuſer well enough <hi>Engliſhes</hi> it) <hi>to all intents and purpoſes</hi> the ſame thing, as if it were had, done, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by that other whom he Repreſents.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Now, if it be the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> then 'tis neither more or leſs, than if we had ſo ſuffer'd our ſelves; there are therefore two things that we have to plead againſt Chriſt's thus Perſonating, or Repreſenting us; and they are, that ſuch a Repreſentation of us by Chriſt, is in differing reſpects, both <hi>too much</hi> and <hi>too little</hi> to anſwer the Exigencies
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33442:38"/>
of our caſe, and the Scripture-account of this matter.</p>
               <p>§. 17. And (1.) In ſome reſpects, Such a <hi>Repreſentative perſonating of ſinners</hi> in and by Chriſt's Sufferings, would render 'em <hi>too little</hi> to anſwer the Exigencies of our Caſe, and the account which the Scriptures give of 'em: For if Chriſt in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was look'd upon as properly, and <hi>moſt ſtrictly</hi> our Perſon or Repreſentative, his ſufferings (as has bin hinted) would be but the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> and no more in Value or Vertue, than if we our ſelves had ſo ſuffered: But if we our ſelves had ſuffer'd as Chriſt did, would it have been effectual to the great and neceſſary purpoſes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Redemption, Reconciliation, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the Holy Spirit, and Eternal Salvation for us! Can any one think? Dare any one ſay, Our own ſuffering what Chriſt did, Our own dying as he did, would <hi>(by way of merit)</hi> have procur'd ſuch conſequent Bleſſings as the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Chriſt did!</p>
               <p>Such as the mention'd Bleſſings we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Caſe call'd for; and theſe Bleſſings we find attributed to the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> as what did <hi>(meritoriouſly,</hi> and by way of a price) procure 'em for us—So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, <hi>we have Redemption through his blood, Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14.

have avail'd to any ſuch purpoſe? If not, how can he herein be ſaid ſtrictly to have Repreſented us—</p>
               <p>The ſame might be alſo pleaded in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the procurement of <hi>our Pardon,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. And <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> Heb. 10. 10, 14.—13. 22. with <hi>Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 9. 10. Theſe are Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſings that we cou'd not have procur'd by our own dying (this, to Chriſtians ſurely, I ſhall not need to prove): Now, if Chriſt died ſtrictly <hi>in our Perſon,</hi> his death had ſignify'd no more than ours: A <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative,</hi> ſo far as he repreſents another, is in Law look'd upon no otherwiſe, than as that other whom He repreſents; whatever Excellencies he may otherwiſe have above that other, yet do they not come under Conſideration here; as a <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> He does but perſonate that other Man; and what He does or ſuffers as a Repreſentative, is but the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> as if that other Man had done or ſuffer'd. So far as there is any difference allow'd in Law, 'tis plain the Law
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33442:41"/>
looks upon 'em to be two diſtinct Perſons; ſo far the one does not, cannot <hi>Repreſent</hi> the other. Either therefore theſe Benefits were not procur'd for us by the Sufferings of Chriſt, or He ſuffer'd otherwiſe than as our <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> or in our mean and vile Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> in the moſt highly dignify'd <hi>Perſon of a Mediator.</hi> To this Senſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had pleaded long ſince, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Treatiſe <hi>of Juſtifying Righteouſneſs,</hi> P. I. p. 96. <q>
                     <hi>If Chriſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſuffer'd but in the Perſon of ſinful Man, his Sufferings wou'd have been in vain, or no Satisfaction to God,</hi> &amp;c.</q> See alſo <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> p. 322. Thus therefore ſuch a Repreſentation of us by Chriſt, wou'd have been <hi>too little</hi> for us.</p>
               <p>§. 18. But again, (2.) If the matter be conſider'd under other reſpects, Chriſt's <hi>ſtrictly perſonating or repreſenting</hi> us in his Sufferings, would be <hi>too much</hi> for us. For (as we have before obſerv'd) betwixt a <hi>Repreſentative</hi> and that other whom he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents,</hi> the Law makes no difference: Whatever the Repreſentative does as a Repreſentative, in the ſenſe of the Law, that other does whom he repreſents.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If then Chriſt ſuffer'd <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and properly in the <hi>Perſon of Sinners,</hi> or as their Repreſentative, they did, in the account of the Law, ſuffer themſelves; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the Moral Effect <hi>(i. e.</hi> whatever the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33442:41"/>
Law under which Chriſt ſuffer'd has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd, by Promiſe, as a Conſequence) of his Suffering, it being the Effect of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative's Sufferings, may be attributed to us whom He did therein repreſent; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Scripture aſcrib'd to the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, as an Effect of 'em, if He ſuffer'd in our Perſon, wou'd be to be aſcrib'd to us: ſo we ſhou'd be our own <hi>Redeemers,</hi> our own <hi>Saviours,</hi> we ſhou'd have merited our own <hi>Peace,</hi> our own <hi>Pardon, &amp;c.</hi> as truly as I pay Money, which one that in the ſtrict Senſe of the Law repreſents me, does pay in my Name; or Purchaſe Land, which my Legal Repreſentative Purchaſes for me.</p>
               <p>§. 19. (2.) If Chriſt had Suffered ſtrictly in our Repreſentative Perſon, we ſhou'd have had <hi>an immediate and abſolute right</hi> to all the proper Reſults and Benefits of his Sufferings: Indeed, if Chriſt in his own Perſon, <hi>as Mediator,</hi> purchas'd theſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by Suffering for us, He may confer 'em on us at what time, in what meaſure, in what order, and upon what terms He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as we find He does: But ſuppoſing Him to have been our proper Repreſentative therein, <hi>our Right</hi> in Law, to all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his Sufferings, wou'd have been <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> (as His now is) and have <hi>immediately reſulted</hi> from his having ſo ſuffered; ſo as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33442:42"/>
that no place cou'd have been left for the introducing and impoſing upon us any Terms or Conditions in order to our enjoying ſuch Benefits: there cou'd be no room for ſuch a Conſtitution afterwards, <hi>if thou</hi> [Sinner] <hi>Repent, Believe in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> For according to this Principle, <hi>the Sinner</hi> has purchas'd Salvation by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt [as <hi>his Repreſentative]</hi> He has thereupon an abſolute and preſent right to the Salvation ſo purchas'd; to deny or ſuſpend his right, or with-hold him from Poſſeſſion, wou'd be <hi>injurious</hi> to Him, as keeping Him from that which is <hi>his own:</hi> How then will this conſiſt with the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> who does not give Sinners immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the full of what was purchas'd by the Sufferings of Chriſt! God does not give 'em an immediate and abſolute <hi>Pardon,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>freedom from all ſin and ſorrow,</hi> preſent <hi>poſſeſſion of the Heavenly Inheritance—</hi>If Sinners have an immediate <hi>abſolute right</hi> to theſe Bleſſings, it wou'd be a wrong done to 'em, for God to keep 'em out of Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as He does; and ſuch a Right we ſhou'd have, if He Suffer'd (ſtrictly) as our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative—So that this way conſider'd, it does as much <hi>exceed,</hi> as the other way it <hi>fell ſhort</hi> of Anſwering the Exigencies of our Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:33442:42"/>
§. 20. And we may add, as a farther Conſequent hereupon (3.) If Chriſt had Suffer'd <hi>(ſtrictly) as the Repreſentative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sinners</hi> (indefinitely, <hi>as 'tis expreſs'd)</hi> it wou'd follow, that every Sinner <hi>equally</hi> has a right to the fore-mention'd Benefits of Chriſt's Sufferings; why then have not all <hi>equally</hi> a Pardon? Why are not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Divine Spirit <hi>equally</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd? Why are ſome (yea, even of the truly ſanctify'd) <hi>more freed</hi> from Sin and Sorrow, than others? Some but <hi>babes,</hi> while others are <hi>ſtrong Men</hi> in Chriſt? Nay, why are not all in Heaven (whom Chriſt did repreſent) as well as ſome there?</p>
               <p>§. 21. Moreover (4.) If Chriſt had thus <hi>ſuffer'd as our Repreſentative</hi> (and we had thus Satisfy'd and Merited in Him) what room would there have been left for <hi>His Holineſs and Obedience to beſtead us,</hi> or be of any advantage to us. We are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſur'd, That <hi>by the Obedience of One</hi> (i. e. of Chriſt) <hi>we are made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. Suppoſe his Sufferings and Death to be included, as it cannot be deny'd, yet 'tis as they were inſtances of his <hi>Obedience,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. and (according to that known Rule, <hi>a quatenus, ad omne valet conſequentia)</hi> if his Sufferings did meritoriouſly procure
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33442:43"/>
our <hi>Pardon, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Obedience to the Law of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, then whatever was an inſtance of ſuch Obedience, had an influence upon the ſame effect. His Habitual, Active and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, are therefore to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as one entire Meritorious Cauſe, one entire Purchaſing Price of ſuch Bleſſings.—But upon this Principle, <hi>That Chriſt in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering did ſtrictly Perſonate, or Repreſent us,</hi> where can his Habitual Holineſs, and Active Obedience be taken in! what room is there for 'em! what need is there of 'em! when we have merited a <hi>Pardon, acceptance with God, Eternal Salvation</hi> already, by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt <hi>as our Repreſentative;</hi> what further need can we have of his Obeying for us?</p>
               <p>Or ſhall we ſay, That He was <hi>our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative,</hi> in his <hi>Obeying,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Suffering?</hi> So indeed our Accuſer would have it, in his <hi>Defence,</hi> P. 28. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>thus Suffering and Obeying in the Perſon of Sinners,</hi> it is, to all intents and purpoſes, <hi>as Effectual, as if they did it themſelves.</hi> But beſides, that theſe two Parts of the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are inconſiſtent with each other, had He <hi>Obeyed in our Perſon,</hi> He needed not to have <hi>Suffer'd in our Perſon;</hi> or had He <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in our Perſon,</hi> He needed not <hi>ſo to have Obey'd.</hi> I ſay, beſides that, the Notion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

                  <p>
                     <hi>That Chriſt's Sufferings were only</hi> Materially, <hi>not</hi> Formally the <hi>ſame we were oblig'd to.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. i THIS our Accuſer charges alſo upon us, as a Branch of <hi>that Deſign,</hi> that Plot he impeaches us of; a <hi>Socinian</hi> Plot, <hi>a Plot to introduce Socinianiſm:</hi> That we have ſuch a <hi>Deſign,</hi> he once and again inſinuates, and thereupon Brands us as <hi>Epiſcopians, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianizing Arminians,</hi> &amp;c. He had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd his Apprehenſions, his <hi>fears of a Deſign againſt the Doctrine of a Real, Full, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Satisfaction to God's Juſtice for our Sins,</hi> P. 4. but by that time we are got to the <hi>12th. Page,</hi> thoſe Surmizes are improv'd into clear Evidence, he is now <hi>aware of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;</hi> nay, twice together we are told it, to intimate (no doubt) that he is <hi>throughly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33442:44"/>
aware of it;</hi> and to make Proof of it, he does alledge, amongſt other Matters, That (according to us) <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings were the ſame we were oblig'd to, only</hi> Materially, <hi>and not</hi> Formally. Now the <hi>Deſign</hi> he ſuggeſts, is what we do from our Souls abhorr; and if this Accuſer were himſelf a <hi>Socinian,</hi> he could no way more effectually ſerve their Intereſts, than by perſuading the World (as he here endeavours) That all muſt be <hi>Socinians,</hi> at leaſt <hi>Socinianize,</hi> that are not <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 2. But for the Principle he charges upon us, we are not aſham'd to own it; and cannot but wonder, that our Accuſer ſhould never once attempt to prove the contrary; it lying upon him here again, as being the Affirmer, to produce his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Surely this, <hi>That Chriſt's Sufferings were Formally the ſame we were oblig'd to,</hi> is not to be reckon'd amongſt thoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which carry their own Light along with 'em, and engage our Aſſent at the firſt Hearing: Why then has he only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd our denial of it, as if that alone, were ſufficient to expoſe us to the ſevereſt Cenſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:33442:45"/>
Sect. 3. But we cannot ſatisfie our ſelves (though we be on the <hi>Negative Part)</hi> to deny, and Diſpute againſt Words that have <hi>no meaning,</hi> or (which is, in Effect, the ſame thing) Words that have <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed and uncertain one:</hi> And therefore though he has not told us <hi>his meaning,</hi> we ſhall, with greateſt plainneſs, tell him, and the World, <hi>ours;</hi> that it may be underſtood what we intend, when we deny, <hi>That Chriſt's Sufferings were</hi> Formally <hi>the ſame we were oblig'd to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 4. Now there are two Things that (we apprehend) may be meant, when 'tis Aſſerted, <hi>That Chriſt's Sufferings were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Materially, <hi>but alſo</hi> Formally <hi>the ſame we were oblig'd to,</hi> viz. Either that they were not only in a more looſe and <hi>general</hi> way of Speaking, but ſtrictly and <hi>fully the ſame kind</hi> of Sufferings that we were oblig'd to: Or, alſo it may intimate, That they were not only the <hi>ſame kind</hi> of Sufferings, but even the <hi>very ſame thing</hi> in Law, as if we our ſelves had Suffer'd. And the former of theſe we dare not admit, much leſs the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:33442:45"/>
Sect. 5. 1. Not the <hi>former, viz.</hi> That Chriſt's Sufferings were <hi>ſtrictly and fully of the ſame kind</hi> with thoſe we were oblig'd to. That they were not, could not be ſo, I think was ſufficiently made appear, Chap. I. Sect. 5. <hi>of this Diſcourſe.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has yet more diſtinctly and fully clear'd it, by an Enumeration of ſeveral Particulars, in which his were not the ſame with ours, under theſe Three Heads;</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Chriſtus nullas tulit penas, quae etiam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata ſunt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Sect. 6. 2. Much leſs can we agree to it in the <hi>Latter</hi> Senſe, as it intimates, That Chriſt's Sufferings were the <hi>Idem,</hi> the very <hi>ſame thing in Law,</hi> as if we our ſelves had Suffer'd; for that this it could not be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs He <hi>Suffer'd</hi> (moſt ſtrictly) <hi>in our Perſon;</hi> and that too, <hi>by vertue of the Law,</hi> which we had Tranſgreſs'd: Both which have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33442:46"/>
been abundantly Diſprov'd by us in the Fore-going Chapters. What has been there alledg'd againſt the one, or the other of thoſe Errors, may alſo have place here again. To which I ſhall only add;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Inconſiſtency hereof with the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction. For if Chriſt's Sufferings ſhould be allow'd to be <hi>ſtrictly the ſame thing</hi> that the Law oblig'd to, then they could not be a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our Non-Payment, but would themſelves have been the <hi>proper Payment:</hi> Now theſe two things are vaſtly differing, to <hi>pay a Debt;</hi> and to offer ſome-what inſtead of Payment, that is accepted as <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for Non-Payment. Since the Word <hi>[Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction]</hi> was borrow'd from the Civilians, from them it is that the Import of it may be beſt underſtood; And they do carefully diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Solution</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction. Solution</hi> is when the very ſame thing is paid, to which the Law oblig'd. So <hi>Vinnius,—Solutio,</hi> ſpecialiter accepta, <hi>denotat</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Notis ad Juſtini. Inſtit. Tit.</hi> 30. <hi>p. (mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi)</hi> 494.</note> 
                  <hi>naturalem praeſtationem ejus quod debetur.</hi> Which is agreeable to the account <hi>Grotius</hi> gives us of it, with whom <hi>Solutio ſtricte ſumpta,</hi> is <hi>Solutio rei plane ejuſdem, quae erat in obligatione; Solutio rei ipſius debitae.</hi> Now <hi>this,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> tells us, <hi>in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Satisf. p.</hi> 123, 126</note> 
                  <hi>the Senſe of the Law is never call'd</hi> Satisfaction, <hi>but ſtrict</hi> Payment. This is what cannot be <note place="margin">P. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:33442:46"/>
refus'd, when offer'd in Payment. But Chriſt's Sufferings might have been refus'd: God was not oblig'd to accept of them, but might have inſiſted upon the Sufferings of Sinners themſelves. Therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> tells of another ſort of <hi>Solution, cum aliud, quam quod in obligatione eſt, Solvitur.</hi> When ſome-what elſe, and not ſtrictly that which the Law requir'd, is paid; and this, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, is peculiarly call'd <hi>Satisfaction. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis autem ſolutio</hi> (ſays he) <hi>quae aut admitti, aut recuſari poteſt, admiſſa; in Jure, ſpeciale habet nomen</hi> Satisfactionis; <hi>quae interdum</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutioni <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 124.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtrictus ſumptae opponitur.</hi> So that by a <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> 'tis plain they intend <hi>a valuable Conſideration</hi> offer'd inſtead of what was due, which the Creditor in Pecuniary (and the Rector in Criminal) Caſes, may accept or refuſe at pleaſure. Under this Notion do the greateſt and beſt of our Divines maintain the Doctrine of Chriſt's <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; nor can it be Defended upon any other bottom. To make the Controverſie betwixt the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Us</hi> (in the Point of <hi>Satisfaction)</hi> to be not (as it has been wont to be ſtated) whether <hi>Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were an Equivalent</hi> (a valuable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) <hi>offer'd and accepted, inſtead of what was due from us to Divine Juſtice;</hi> ſo far as that upon account thereof, we have Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, Pardon, and Eternal Salvation,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33442:47"/>
in the Order, and upon the Terms of the Goſpel? I ſay, to make the Queſtion in difference, not to be what is above-ſaid, but whether <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings be the very ſame thing,</hi> the All, <hi>that the Law requir'd,</hi> oblig'd to, <hi>the very Execution of its Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi> How plainly is this to betray the Cauſe into their Hands!</p>
               <p>If the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> has any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Controverſie (and while the Learned World has ſo univerſally approv'd what he has wrote in it, they cann't them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be thought to have much, that deny, or doubt his thorow Acquaintance with it; and of all Men living, our Accuſer, who has <hi>appeal'd</hi> to him, ſurely does not ſuſpect it; I ſay, if that Right Reverend Perſon has any inſight into this Matter) the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Cauſe can ſcarcely any way be more effectually befriended, than by ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be their Adverſaries, do thus State our Controverſie with 'em: For with theſe remarkable Words does he cloſe up his moſt Convincing Reaſonings againſt <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings having been the very ſame thing which the Law requir'd:</hi> 
                  <q>When (ſays he) our Adverſaries (meaning the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians)</hi> Diſpute againſt this Opinion, no wonder if they do it ſucceſsfully; but this whole Opinion is built upon a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, that Satisfaction muſt be the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33442:47"/>
of the very ſame; which while they Contend for, they give our Enemies too great an advantage, and make 'em think they triumph over the Faith of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Diſcourſe of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, P.</hi> 17.</note> Church, when they do it only over the Miſtake of ſome particular Perſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither could the Sufferings of Chriſt be <hi>ſtrictly</hi> (and individually) <hi>the ſame thing that the Law threatned;</hi> for it threatned the Death of the Offenders themſelves: <hi>In the day</hi> Thou <hi>eateſt,</hi> Thou <hi>ſhalt die,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. The ſame Individual that ſinneth, ſhall die: Thus does the Prophet expreſs it, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it</hi> (that very Soul) <hi>ſhall die.</hi> Ezek. 18. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The very ſinning ſoul it ſelf, that very ſoul ſhall die.</hi> The Senſe of the Holy Ghoſt could not have been more fully expreſſed to this purpoſe. And ſo alſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that continues not,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis denounc'd againſt no one but the Sinner himſelf? ſince then the Law mentions no Surety or Subſtitute; the Sufferings of Chriſt could not be the Execution of its threatning, unleſs He was <hi>the very Soul that ſinned,</hi> that very individual Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:33442:48"/>
And hence we may be aſſiſted in that only Difficulty, with which our Accuſer (at the ſecond hand) does ſeem to preſs us: For in the Paſſage he quotes from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> (P. 5.) amongſt other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of GOD that were to influence the Grand Affair of our Redemption, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>Divine Veracity: God's Truth</hi> (as that Gentleman ſays) <hi>and his Immutability muſt be evidenc'd in proceeding according to the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Intereſt of Reaſon in Religion,</hi> p. 536.</note> 
                  <hi>Penal Law He had at firſt Enacted.</hi> And this being preſuppos'd, he would naturally enough iufer, <hi>That Man</hi> (having ſinn'd) <hi>could not be receiv'd into favour, but in ſuch a way as might evidence that Truth of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now indeed, if the <hi>Truth and Immutability</hi> of GOD did require, that He ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (exactly) according to the <hi>Penal Law</hi> He had Enacted, it muſt be granted then, That Chriſt's Sufferings could not otherwiſe beſtead us, then as being the very Execution of that <hi>Penal Law,</hi> the very Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty therein threatned.</p>
               <p>And this Objection I ſhall the rather take notice of, becauſe (whatever Character our Accuſer, and this Brother of his deſerv'd) I find ſome of greateſt Name (and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly too) both for Learning and Piety, ſpeak as if they did apprehend, <hi>That the Truth of GOD did engage Him to Execute
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33442:48"/>
the Threatned Penalty;</hi> that unleſs the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due by that Law had been inflicted, his Veracity could not have been Juſtified.</p>
               <p>But (how much ſoever I reverence the Names of ſome that ſpeak thus) I dare not agree, out of reſpect to any Man, ſo far to expoſe the <hi>Veracity</hi> of the Holy GOD, as to ſuſpend it upon any thing that is <hi>not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly True,</hi> much leſs upon what is <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently untrue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſing it only to be <hi>uncertain,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He was oblig'd formally to Execute the Threatning of that Law, 'tis no way fit the <hi>Veracity of God</hi> ſhould be ſuſpended upon an Uncertainty: May I not be ſure that GOD is true, though I were not ſure, that his Threatning muſt needs be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted!</p>
               <p n="2">2. And eſpecially, when we have full and clear Evidence, That He has not Executed that Threatning; we ſhould ſurely be afraid to ſay, His <hi>Truth oblig'd Him</hi> to Execute it; He has <hi>falſify'd his Word</hi> in Not-Executing it. Though we could not ſee which way GOD's <hi>Veracity</hi> could be reconcil'd with the <hi>Non-Execution</hi> of his Threatning; yet when He has Relax'd or Diſpens'd with his Threatning (as in this Caſe He manifeſtly has) we may be aſſur'd, it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33442:49"/>
with his Truth. The Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Delinquent himſelf, and every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent; another (who was no Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) dies for us: Here is not then an Execution of the Threatning; is the Truth of GOD therefore violated? GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. Yet had his <hi>Truth</hi> oblig'd Him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Threatned Penalty at all, it would as well have oblig'd Him to inflict it on the Offenders themſelves. That GOD has inflicted Death for Sin, is not therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Truth, but for other Reaſons that have been already hinted. And this is that which does difference <hi>Threatnings</hi> from <hi>Predictions:</hi> That <hi>Threatnings</hi> do only conſtitute the dueneſs of Puniſhment, and make the Offender obnoxious, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terming certainly whether (eventually) it ſhall be inflicted, or not; but <hi>Predictions</hi> do primarily reſpect a certain Event. So that the Truth of GOD is indeed concern'd to accompliſh a <hi>Prediction;</hi> but not to execute a <hi>Threatning;</hi> a meer <hi>Threatning</hi> does only render the Tranſgreſſor liable to ſuffer, but GOD is afterwards at liberty to inflict, or not inflict the Penalty incurr'd, as his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſhall ſee fit; indeed if a <hi>Prediction</hi> ſhould alſo be added to the Threatning, GOD's Word is then paſt for its Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his <hi>Truth</hi> obliges Him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—They that are otherwiſe Opinionated in this Matter, may do well to conſider,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33442:49"/>
which way the <hi>Veracity</hi> of GOD (upon their Hypotheſis) can poſſibly be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd: <hi>When the Law was at firſt given to Adam</hi> (as our Accuſer himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly owns) <hi>Chriſt was not in its obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it did not run</hi> [Thou, or thy Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety for thee.] Hereupon the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion of a Surety, and the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring our Puniſhment upon Him (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing He had undergone, as far as was poſſible, the ſame that we ſhould) was an Act of <hi>Soveraign-Diſpenſing-Power:</hi> The Threatning was ſo far relax'd, or diſpens'd with; not Executed. But if GOD had engag'd his Word (by an abſolute Prediction) to puniſh the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, there had been no place for a Diſpenſation; In that caſe, as indeed in every caſe where the Divine <hi>Truth</hi> is concern'd, the Event will infallibly, and in every reſpect be anſwerable to what GOD has fore-declared. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Event did not anſwer in this caſe, <hi>the very ſinning Soul it ſelf did not die,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That this was not a Prediction of what <hi>eventually</hi> ſhould be, but a meer Threatning of what <hi>legally</hi> might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; importing only what the <hi>Sinner was oblig'd</hi> to undergo, not what <hi>GOD was oblig'd</hi> to lay upon him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33442:50"/>
his <hi>Truth</hi> was no way violated, though Chriſt's Sufferings were not ſtrictly the ſame Thing that the Law threatned. To which I might add,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if Chriſt's Sufferings had been <hi>the very ſame thing</hi> that the Law requir'd, we muſt thereupon, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd preſent and perfect Deliverance; if the <hi>Idem,</hi> the <hi>all</hi> (and that it muſt needs be, if it was the <hi>ſame)</hi> that the Law threatned, was endur'd in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, what further Penalty could remain upon us?

For the cloſe therefore of this Head, let it be conſider'd, That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (in that very Book to which our Accuſer refers us) thus Explains the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion before us: <q>It is not (ſays he) <hi>de materia debiti</hi> that we enquire, but <hi>de forma;</hi> whether it was the ſame <hi>formally</hi> which we ow'd, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation requir'd?

Sect. 2. We do therefore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh (in reference to the Controverſie, Whether <hi>our Sins were the Meritorious Cauſe of Chriſt's Sufferings)</hi> betwixt the <hi>Name,</hi> and the <hi>Thing</hi> intended by it; as every one ſurely will do, that does not prefer <hi>Strife</hi> before <hi>Truth.</hi> If we can agree in this, or other Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, in <hi>Senſe, Words</hi> are not worthy of a Contention on either ſide: 'Tis ſtrange that what the Apoſtle has ſaid of ſuch Contentions, that juſt account he has given of their ſo baſe <hi>Original,</hi> and ſad <hi>Effects,</hi> ſhould not Awe the Spirits of all (at leaſt) that make any Pretenſions to the <hi>Chriſtian Name,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4.

I wou'd requite all this Accuſer's hard Speeches of us, with a ſerious Admonition that he wou'd carefully look into the Text laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and if to that he adds, what does occur, in <hi>The Carnality of Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> p. 39, 40, 41, 42. <hi>(A Tract well worthy of its moſt excellent Author.)</hi> Perhaps, it may miniſter towards the Cure of his ſo <hi>ſickly</hi> Mind; and he may not hereafter ſo far <hi>dote</hi> upon an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Word or Phraſe, or turn it to our Reproach, that we are not alike fond of 'em.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3.

by it, that is not readily agreed to by us. We have reaſon to ſuppoſe, That he himſelf may intend ſome-what more by it, than we are willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (and which in due place may be taken notice of): But we cannot find that they thereby deſign (in general) to expreſs any thing more, than that <hi>the Sufferings of Chriſt had a reſpect to ſin, to our ſins, as the ground or reaſon of 'em;</hi> they were the aſſumed Cauſe of 'em; He ſuffer'd <hi>for,</hi> or on the account of <hi>our ſins.</hi> Now, whereas it may be difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how, or which way our Sins cou'd influence his Sufferings in ſuch ſort, as that He ſhou'd be ſaid to ſuffer for our ſins, to <hi>die for our ſins:</hi> What they ſay for the clearing this Relation that our Sins had to the Sufferings of Chriſt, as an <hi>Antecedent,</hi> procuring <hi>Cauſe</hi> (for we meddle not now with the other Reſpect they bear to 'em as a <hi>final Cauſe;</hi> though He alſo ſuffer'd for our Sins, ſo as in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe to Expiate, and make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for 'em) I ſay, the whole of what they offer, for the clearing the Relation our Sins had to Chriſt's Sufferings, as their Antecedent Procuring Cauſe, may (ſo far as I have yet obſerv'd) be reduc'd to the following particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>

Sect. 4. I. <hi>Our Sins,</hi> both in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, and according to the Conſtitution of the Divine Law, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd Death,</hi> Eternal Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. This was what they had render'd <hi>our Due;</hi> they were (in the ſtricteſt and moſt proper Senſe) <hi>Meritorious</hi> of our own Sufferings. Had we lain Eternally under the Avenging Wrath of GOD, it cou'd not have been ſaid, with Truth, that He had done us any wrong; it wou'd have been but <hi>the Wages</hi> we had earn'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And what Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do actually undergo.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Hereupon (Death being the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our Sin) it follows, <hi>That we must of neceſſity ſuffer, unleſs we be forgiven;</hi> for no one (ſurely) will, or can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, That it might be avoided by our own Power or Policy (whether alone, or in Conjunction with any other Creature, or Creatures): Is it poſſible we ſhou'd either hide from GOD's <hi>All-ſeeing Eye,</hi> or prevail againſt his <hi>All-powerful Hand!</hi> We cannot therefore eſcape againſt, or without the <hi>Divine Pleaſure.</hi> Now, a Liberation, a Deliverance from deſerved Wrath, that does depend upon, and derive from the <hi>Divine Will</hi> and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33442:55"/>
is moſt <hi>Proper Remiſſion,</hi> as has been before ſaid. And, how is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that the Miſeries which the Law threatned, and we had deſerv'd by our Sins, cou'd otherwiſe poſſibly be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than by vertue of ſuch an interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Act of the Divine Will, whereby the Penalty is graciouſly remitted.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Several things concurr'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it <hi>unmeet, that GOD ſhould meerly Pardon;</hi> that He ſhould ſo forgive the <hi>Sinner,</hi> as not to leave (one way or other) any ſevere marks of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon <hi>ſin.</hi> He did retain (in the heighth of his Diſpleaſure) ſuch a <hi>Love of Benevolence,</hi> as did incline Him to commiſerate the caſe of lapſed, ſinful Man; and (in ſome befitting way) to re-admit him into favour. But it was highly fit and neceſſary, it ſhou'd be in ſuch a way as ſhou'd both duly provide for the Honour of GOD, and be moſt apt to deter and affright Men from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Due regard muſt be had to both theſe; the Sinner cou'd not be forgiven, unleſs (conſiſtently therewith) the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of GOD cou'd be ſecur'd, and ſin render'd frightful, and to be dreaded by us. Now in reference to</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:33442:55"/>
The <hi>Former;</hi> the <hi>Honour of God</hi> did require, That if He Pardon Sinners, it ſhou'd be in ſuch a way, as ſhou'd mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly vindicate and acquit Him, from the Reflections that are not uncommon upon ſuch occaſions. 'Tis a very uſual and known caſe, in Humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Soveraign's Reputation ſuffers by too eaſie Pardons: In the caſe before us, it is exceeding plain, That the Honour of GOD's <hi>Power and Wiſdom, but ſpecially of his Holineſs and Juſtice,</hi> were to be provided for; whilſt He magnify'd his <hi>Mercy</hi> in our Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas nothing is more common, than for too <hi>eaſie Pardons</hi> to be <hi>imputed</hi> to a Governour, as an Evidence of his <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and want of Power; it was a moſt condecent and becoming thing, That GOD ſhould Pardon in ſuch a way, as yet ſhou'd manifeſt his <hi>Power;</hi> that it might appear, He was not afraid, or <hi>unable</hi> to vindicate his injur'd Law; That He did not forgive, through a meer want of Power to puniſh.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:33442:56"/>
2. It was equally fit and neceſſary, That He ſhould alſo vindicate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and not by a light and eaſie Pardon tempt the World to impeach Him of Levity and <hi>Folly;</hi> as if He had raſhly and unadviſedly made a Law, of the Conſequences whereof He was not aware; and therefore was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards oblig'd to change his mind, and indemnifie the Tranſgreſſors, without any Compenſation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, a meer Pardon would alſo have reflected upon his <hi>Holineſs;</hi> it was therefore neceſſary that GOD (for the Vindication of his Eſſential Purity) ſhou'd make it appear, that He <hi>hated ſin,</hi> though He <hi>lov'd the Sinner;</hi> that Men might not look upon Him to be a GOD <hi>that has pleaſure in Iniquity</hi> (the direct contrary to what He has declar'd of Himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 4.) neither yet, as if He was indifferently affected towards it. <hi>He is</hi> (as we are aſſur'd) <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</hi> i. e. So as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or not to be diſpleas'd at it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. This <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his, is that which gives a moſt adorable and conſpicuous Beauty and Luſtre to all his other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>He is Glorious in Holineſs, Exod.</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:33442:56"/>
15. 11. And therefore it cou'd be no way meet, that the Honour of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſhould be neglected, or <hi>poſt-pon'd</hi> to our ſafety: 'Twere better that Ten Thouſand Worlds ſhould periſh, than that the Glory of GOD's Holineſs be ſtain'd: But how ſhall it be vindicated, if Sin be abſolutely remitted! That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion we find betwixt <hi>his Holineſs,</hi> and his <hi>not forgiving ſin, Joſh.</hi> 24. 19. does very plainly intimate, That the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is a Bar that lies in the way of Pardon, that does (as it were) oblige GOD not to give out Pardons too eaſily; not to Pardon abſolutely, or without due Proviſion made for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating his Antipathy againſt Sin; that in his Eye (as well as in its own nature) 'tis an abominable <hi>thing,</hi> what his Soul hates, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was further neceſſary, That the Reputation of his <hi>Governing Juſtice,</hi> ſhou'd alſo be conſulted. GOD (conſider'd as a Governour) is neceſſarily <hi>Juſt,</hi> cannot but be ſo: How monſtrous a ſound wou'd theſe two Words conjoyn'd carry in 'em <hi>[an unjuſt GOD!]</hi> they do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſtroy and ſubvert each other; He that is GOD cannot be unjuſt; and that Being that is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> for that very reaſon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33442:57"/>
cannot poſſibly be GOD. Now this <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD, not only has place in the conferring <hi>Promiſed Rewards,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the executing <hi>threatned Penalties:</hi> Of the <hi>former,</hi> no one makes a doubt; 'tis the <hi>latter</hi> therefore that only needs to be clear'd: And how plain is it that even the Puniſhment of Sin is ſtill men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd as an Act of Juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8.—2. 5. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 5. 7.—19. 2. But though in the nature of the thing, and from theſe Texts it is moſt evident, That when GOD puniſhes Sin, He does it juſtly; it may yet be a doubtful Caſe with ſome, <hi>Whether, or how far his Juſtice obliges Him to puniſh it?</hi> And that it does oblige Him in ſome Caſes, ſurely ſhou'd be agreed; for that we cannot form a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rectoral Juſtice,</hi> that does not import and carry in it <hi>a difference betwixt the Righteous and the Wicked in its Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions;</hi> it will not admit, that all be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like treated: The <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> therefore complains of this, as one of the great Evils of our World, That <hi>there be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Men to whom it happens according to the work of the Wicked, and wicked Men to whom it happens according to the work of the Righteous,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 14. But is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>it ſhall not</hi> (at laſt) <hi>be well with 'em,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:33442:57"/>
v. 13. GOD has declar'd this <hi>Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wicked in Humane Judicatures, to be an abomination to Him,</hi> Prov. 17. 15. and has accordingly denounc'd <hi>a Woe</hi> againſt it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 23. and therefore ſurely it can have no place with Him. Beſides that in reference to Himſelf, we are aſſur'd, that He is <hi>no Reſpecter of Perſons</hi> in Judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11. which Text is the more conſiderable, for that the Apoſtle does there alledge this as an Argument to Evince, That <hi>GOD will render to every man according to his works,</hi> and thereby manifeſt his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be Righteous,</hi> v. 5. 6. Intimating that his <hi>Juſtice</hi> does conſiſt therein, <hi>viz. In rendring to every one according to his works;</hi> his Juſtice obliges Him thereto: Now, that we may not miſtakingly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that He intends it only of <hi>the good that is their due,</hi> He carefully diſtinguiſhes betwixt Good and bad, and applies this Exerciſe of Juſtice to both—Not only will He (as Juſtice obliges Him) <hi>render glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good,</hi> but alſo (as the ſame Juſtice obliges) <hi>tribulation and anguiſh upon every Soul of Man that does evil,</hi> ver. 9. 10. Not upon one, or two, but <hi>every one; for there is no reſpect of perſons with GOD.</hi> And (to give this yet the greater force)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33442:58"/>
we find it conjoyn'd with the denial of any Iniquity in GOD, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>There is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons.</hi> Signifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, That ſhou'd GOD (as a <hi>Ruler)</hi> deal unequally with Perſons, whoſe caſes are the ſame; or deal alike with Perſons, whoſe caſes are differing (either of which ways there wou'd be a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now upon theſe Conceſſions of <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> it may be inferr'd, That ſuppoſing GOD to rule us by his Laws, we muſt conceive of Him as <hi>neceſſarily</hi> oblig'd to puniſh the Impenitent; But, why is He ſo neceſſitated to puniſh? <hi>That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Majeſty, and the Authority of his Law may be maintain'd:</hi> And that Principle (as we may call it) that in God which obliges Him for theſe Ends to puniſh the Impenitent, the Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, he allows to be <hi>his Juſtice.</hi> Now therefore if <hi>Crellius</hi> will conſiſt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I think he needs muſt own, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs GOD Govern the World ſo, as to attain the great Ends of Government, he would not be <hi>Juſt;</hi> and that thoſe Ends cannot be attain'd, unleſs Sin be puniſh'd, will eaſily be made appear, if any one ſhou'd make a doubt of it; but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33442:59"/>
the further Conſideration of this, is more properly to be reſerv'd, till we meet with it in the Second Part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, let it be obſerv'd, how far we have proceeded; and theſe things ſeem to be very plain, <hi>viz.</hi> That GOD is (in a moſt proper Senſe) the <hi>Governour</hi> of Intelligent Creatures; That (as ſuch) He is moſt neceſſarily <hi>Juſt;</hi> That his Juſtice does reſpect the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of <hi>Rewards and Puniſhments,</hi> and that however in Reference either to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Puniſhments, it may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oblige Him to execute ſtrictly what the very Letter of the Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; yet will it not admit, either in reference to the one or other, of any ſuch Relaxation or Change, as wou'd not well conſiſt with, and ſecure the great Ends of Threatnings or Promiſes. This <hi>Governing Juſtice</hi> therefore was a further Bar in the way of a meer Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; GOD could not (conſiſtently herewith) abſolutely Pardon: If the <hi>very Penalty threatned</hi> be not inflicted, <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf requir'd that an <hi>Equivalent</hi> ſhould, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch Sufferings as ſhould as well attain the ends of the Law, as the threatned Penalty it ſelf ſhould. Thus,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33442:59"/>
in reſpect of GOD, his <hi>Honour,</hi> the Honour of his <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Holineſs, and Governing Juſtice,</hi> did neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that if GOD Pardon the <hi>Sinner,</hi> He ſhould yet (one way or other) leave ſuch marks of his diſpleaſure upon <hi>Sin,</hi> as ſhou'd as effectually ſupport the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſecure the Ends of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as if the Sinner himſelf had ſuffer'd according to the utmoſt rigour of the Law. And in reference alſo,</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Latter</hi> Thing mention'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> That we be diſcourag'd and affrighted from Sinning; in order thereto, it was alike neceſſary, that Sin ſhou'd with great Severity be animadverted on; if no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was inflicted, or none propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to the Offence, what ſhou'd keep the World in awe, or make 'em afraid of Sinning yet again? Crimes unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd are too much countenanc'd at leaſt, if they be not thereby authoriz'd. We ſee the <hi>meer delay</hi> of Puniſhment is very frequently abus'd to this purpoſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in 'em to do evil.</hi> And if meer Forbearance have this effect, what (may we ſuppoſe) wou'd have been the conſequence of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33442:60"/>
Forgiveneſs? So that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude GOD cou'd not (conſiſtently with either his own Honour, or our Safety) Pardon Sin without a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it was neceſſary that Sufferings ſhou'd be inſiſted on; and ſuch Sufferings as ſhou'd be <hi>Equivalent</hi> to what was Threatned, Sufferings that were adapted to anſwer the ends of the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as well, or better than the Sufferings of Sinners themſelves. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In order to our Remiſſion, the <hi>Sufferings of Chriſt</hi> were inſiſted on by the Father, and agreed to by the Son; by his Sufferings it was effected, brought to paſs, that Sin might be remitted, without either reflecting any Diſhonour upon GOD, or (in the leaſt) encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging any to Sin. His Sufferings did fully anſwer all the Exigencies of our Caſe; and therefore this Conſtitution is mention'd by the Apoſtle as a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and <hi>becoming</hi> one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Suppoſing ſo Gracious an Intendment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, That GOD deſign'd to put us into the Hand of Chriſt, that He might <hi>bring us to Glory,</hi> it was what well <hi>became God, to make the Captain of our Salvation perfect through Sufferings.</hi> But
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33442:60"/>
what Condecency or Becomingneſs wou'd there have been in it; if Sin might have been pardon'd, and the Sinner ſav'd as well without it?

conſiſted with <hi>Mercy</hi> alone; or the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all Apoſtate Sinners with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> alone; yet if GOD wou'd be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to Sinners, He muſt alſo be Juſt; and that He cou'd not be, unleſs He ſo far, and in ſuch a way puniſh Sin, as will ſuffice to keep up his own Honour and Authority, and effectually to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Sin: And hence it was that Chriſt became the Propitiation for our Sins.—Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="5">V. And in the laſt place, The Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt being thus inſiſted on, in order to his being a Succeſsful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator with GOD for Sinners, He is therefore ſaid to have <hi>died for us,</hi> and <hi>for our Sins.</hi> Our Sins render'd Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary: GOD thereupon inſiſts on Suffering, without ſhedding of Blood He will allow no Remiſſion: Hereupon Chriſt conſents to die, and accordingly dies a Sacrifice for us, <hi>bears our ſins, carries our griefs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 5. And this is that relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Sins and the Sufferings of Chriſt, which is intended to be expreſs'd by <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others, when they ſay, Our Sins were the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe of his Sufferings,</hi> i. e. they deſerv'd Death,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33442:61"/>
and ſo bound us over to it, as that we cou'd not be exempted from it, without <hi>a Satisfaction,</hi> without ſome-what Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to our dying; in which Exigency Chriſt dies for us. I cannot find that they (or, which with every Chriſtian ſurely ſhou'd yet be of greater weight, that the Scriptures themſelves) do mean any thing more.

               <p>Sect. 6. And to all this we do readily agree; yea, how fully has Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpoken to this Senſe, particularly in his <hi>Reaſons of the Christian Religion,</hi> Part I. Cap. 15. Sect. 9. P. 161, 162, 163. So alſo Part II. c. 4. §. 6. P. 232. and c. 5. §. 10. P. 253, 254. The Paſſages are too large to Tranſcribe. But he has there very plainly intimated, That GOD neither has, nor cou'd <hi>Pardon Sinners without ſuch a Sacrifice, or ſubstitute-means, as might preſerve the Honour of his Law and Government, and the future Innoceney of his Subjects, as well as their Puniſhment in the full Senſe of the Law wou'd have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 7. Now when the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Thing is agreed to, all that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> intend by that Phraſe, 'tis a very inſipid thing for any one vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to contend what Word or Name to call it by: What if one call our Sins the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe,</hi> another the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritorious Cauſe,</hi> another the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of Chriſt's Sufferings; whilſt they are all agreed as to the Reference they had to 'em: But if any one by a <hi>Meritorious

               <p>Sect. 8. We blame no one therefore meerly for calling our Sins the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> of Chriſt's Sufferings; nay, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf ſometimes calls 'em ſo, the <hi>Meritorious, or Pro-meritorious Cauſe.

               <p>Sect. 9. But though we allow others their Liberty, yet (accurately ſpeaking) it muſt be ſaid, That all that Reference that our Sins had to the Sufferings of Chriſt, does not amount to a <hi>Proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe:</hi> Nor did <hi>Grotius</hi> ever think it did; whatever our Accuſer may imagine; For though he does affirm (as is intimated, <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 6.) that <hi>Praeter Dei &amp; Christi voluntatem, datur Cauſa

Our Sins only did deſerve Sufferings, and thoſe of ſuch a value, and cou'd not be remitted, unleſs ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was made to Divine Juſtice for 'em; but they never did <hi>deſerve that Chriſt ſhould die;</hi> they made it neceſſary, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we be Redeem'd, that it be by ſuch a Price; but they did not deſerve that we ſhou'd be Redeem'd with his Precious Blood: All that <hi>Grotius</hi> aſſerts is, That Death was deſerv'd, he no where ſays that Chriſt's Death was ſo.</p>

§. 10. And this is the true Reaſon why we are not fond of the Phraſe <hi>[a Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe]</hi> becauſe it wou'd intimate, <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings were deſerv'd:</hi> Now if they were deſerv'd, it muſt either be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, that they were the very thing that the Law threatned, or we (by our Sins) deſerv'd God ſhou'd Save and Ranſom us by ſuch Sufferings. If either of theſe be true, our Sins may then be ſaid to be the Meritorious, the <hi>proper meritorious Cauſe</hi> of Chriſt's Sufferings, as our Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer wou'd have 'em; but cannot be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly ſo, otherwiſe than upon the one, or the other of theſe Principles. In that they deſerv'd ſuch Sufferings for weight, and cou'd not be remitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Sufferings, and Chriſt hereupon conſented to ſuffer for 'em, they may be call'd the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or, much more fitly, the <hi>ground,</hi> the <hi>reaſon,</hi> the <hi>aſſum'd cauſe,</hi> the <hi>pro-meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> or <hi>quaſi-meritorious</hi> Cauſe of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: But the real, <hi>proper meritorious</hi> Cauſe of 'em they cou'd not be, unleſs they in a ſtrict and proper Senſe <hi>deſerv'd that Chriſt ſhou'd die.</hi> Now the Death of Chriſt is conſiderable under a two-fold Notion, either as a Curſe or Bleſſing. As inflicted upon Him, 'twas a moſt <hi>dreadful Curſe:</hi> As it was our Ranſom, the Price of our Redemption, it was and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33442:65"/>
is a moſt <hi>invaluable Bleſſing.</hi> If our Sins therefore deſerv'd the Death of Chriſt, it muſt be either in the one, or the other of theſe Reſpects: But no one ſurely will dare to ſay, That our <hi>Sins deſerv'd ſuch a Ranſom;</hi> that GOD in giving his Son to be the Saviour of the World, gave us no more than we deſerv'd; this were egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Blaſphemy, againſt the brighteſt and moſt amazing <hi>Inſtance of Love,</hi> with which God ever bleſs'd the World.</p>
               <p>§. 11. It remains then, that (ſuppoſing our Sins the Proper Meritorious Cauſe of Chriſt's death) they did <hi>deſerve it as a Curſe to be inflicted upon Him,</hi> tho' not as a Bleſſing influential upon us. And 'tis not conceivable how our Sins cou'd ſo deſerve the death of Chriſt, unleſs this be ſuppos'd to be <hi>the very thing threatned</hi> in the Law; <hi>[if thou ſinnest, Christ ſhall die]:</hi> And this our Accuſer ſometimes ſeems to intend; what elſe can he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly mean, when he tells us, <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 25. <hi>If Christ's Obligation to ſuffer did not reſult from this Law</hi> (i. e. the Law which we had violated) <hi>our Sins were not the Impulſive Cauſe of his Sufferings: Or, if it did not immediately, our Sins were but the Remote Cauſe, or Occaſion; not a meer Impulſive, or Proper Meritorious Cauſe of 'em.</hi> And p. 50. <hi>If Christs Sufferings be not ex obligatione Legis</hi> (we ſuppoſe he means the

               <p>Here therefore I wou'd have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Death of Chriſt was not threatned by that Law, but that I have already largely done it, both in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Chapters of this Diſcourſe: And our Accuſer himſelf has render'd it the leſs needful, by <hi>giving it as his true Senſe, That when the Law was at firſt given

               <p>§. 12. To ſum up this Head then, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxneſs does not conſiſt in Words and Phraſes; 'twould be egregious weakneſs to imagine, That the Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Socinians are only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this, or the other Word, or Form of Speaking, be moſt apt and expreſſive of that Truth about which there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: That which the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> has obſerv'd, with a more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a <hi>Change of Perſons,</hi> will admit a much more extenſive Application. <q>It is not (ſays he) the uſe of the Words, but the Senſe of 'em is to be enquir'd into.</q> See his Lordſhip's <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> inſerted in the <hi>Anſwer to the Report,</hi> p. 57. 'Tis not the bare Word <hi>[Trinity]</hi> that divides betwixt them and us in that point,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33442:66"/>
or the term <hi>[Perſon]</hi> or <hi>[Satisfaction]</hi> or <hi>[meritorious Cauſe] &amp;c.</hi> But 'tis the Senſe deſign'd to be expreſs'd by thoſe Terms, in which they will not agree with us; wou'd they allow the Truth we plead for, that is wont to be expreſs'd by thoſe Words; they wou'd no longer be <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> nor wou'd any wiſe Man perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Contention with 'em, tho' they ſhou'd yet be unſatisfy'd as to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Phraſes.</p>
               <p>Our Accuſer therefore does not (to uſe that Right Reverend Perſons Words again) <hi>diſcover his profound Knowledge in theſe Matters, if he think,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>Ap.</hi> p. 39. That the Heart of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie lies in <hi>Aſſerting</hi> or <hi>Denying</hi> our Sins to be the <hi>Properly Meritorious</hi> Cauſe of Chriſt's Sufferings: And if <hi>He know otherwiſe, and to deſign to impoſe upon thoſe that do not, where is his Ingenuity.</hi> 'Tis ſo far from being true, that the Heart of the Controverſie lies here, that ſo far as I have yet obſerv'd, this very Man is the firſt that ever aſſerted, Our Sins were the <hi>Properly</hi> meritorious Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c. Grotius, Voſſius,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> do indeed ſpeak of 'em as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe; but how they explain themſelves we have before manifeſted as to two of 'em.

thing more, than only that they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meritorious of Sufferings, that they cou'd not be remitted without 'em; and that in this Exigency, Chriſt conſents to ſuffer for us; whereupon he calls 'em the Meritorious Cauſe of his Sufferings; though he (as <hi>Grotius)</hi> means it only of the Sufferings he underwent, not of thoſe Sufferings as undergone by Him.

               <p>§. 1. IN this Point alſo, our Accuſer is as Clamourous, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and what has been ſaid in the fore-going Chapter will furniſh out a juſt Anſwer to all his Cavils upon this Head. He repreſents us, as if we did allow the Sufferings of Chriſt to be the Puniſhment of Sin, only ſo far, and in the ſame Senſe as <hi>Crellius</hi> does, <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 27. but deny'd 'em to be a <hi>Proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and that therefore we are againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt's Satisfaction, Ap.</hi> p. 4. 10.

§. 2. But after all, what if it ſhould appear, That the Phraſe is Ambiguous; that in one Senſe (and which is plainly the Senſe of that very Judicious and Learned Biſhop, and others, that uſe the Phraſe) it is true, <hi>That the Sufferings of Chriſt are a Proper Puniſhment;</hi> and yet in another Senſe (which ſhall appear to be the Senſe of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and thoſe whoſe Sentiments agree with his in this Matter) it is as true, <hi>That Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not a Proper Puniſhment, but Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically only to be ſo call'd:</hi> That the Biſhop never own'd it, nor any Perſon of note, in the Senſe in which we deny it; and that we do not, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> never did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, in the Senſe in which the Biſhop, (and other Famous Defenders of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith againſt <hi>Socinianiſm)</hi> Aſſert and Plead for it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. To Evince this, there needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a Juſt Repreſentation of their Senſe; what the one and the other intend by a <hi>Proper Puniſhment,</hi> and this they themſelves were beſt able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs: Now then to conſtitute a <hi>Proper Puniſhment</hi> in the Biſhop's Senſe, there is no more needful, than that there be Sufferings inflicted on the account of Sin, to deter Men from Sinning, and to aſſert GOD's Rights as a Sovereign, and vindicate his Honour to the World.

               </p>
               <p>§. 5. This therefore is the only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that can lie betwixt us and our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, Whether Chriſt was <hi>really</hi> a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or not? If not (which we hope our Accuſer himſelf will not ſcruple to ſay with us) then his Sufferings were not a <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> in that moſt full and proper Senſe, in which the Sufferings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on <hi>Sinnners themſelves</hi> are ſo call'd. We willingly allow, That they were as <hi>properly Puniſhments,</hi> as it was poſſible the Sufferings of one, who was himſelf no Sinner, cou'd be; but we dare not ſay, that Chriſt was a Sinner: And therefore, though He ſuffer'd for Sin, yet the Sin (ſince it was not his own) did not ſo nearly and immediately ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt liable to Suffering, as it did the Sinner himſelf. Death was not due to Chriſt <hi>immediately</hi> upon our having ſinn'd; the Law did not threaten Chriſt [if Men ſin, thou ſhalt die]: After we had ſinned, there was no one obnoxious to Suffering for it beſides our ſelves, 'till Chriſt voluntarily undertook to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; he was not antecedently oblig'd,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33442:70"/>
but (when he might have refus'd) he freely choſe to die for us, <hi>He gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our ſins,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. He <hi>gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for us,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>§. 6. So that here is a vaſt difference betwixt the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Sufferings of a <hi>Sinner.</hi> The Sinner, and Chriſt do indeed each ſuffer on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Sin, ſo far they agree; but the Sinner ſuffers for his own ſin, Chriſt for the ſins of others; the Sinner ſuffers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, he <hi>receives the due reward of his deeds,</hi> Luk. 23. 41. but Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were undeſerv'd, he having done nothing amiſs: The Sinners ſufferings were threatned by the Law; but where do we find any threatning againſt Chriſt: The Sinners Sufferings are inflicted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and againſt his Conſent; but Chriſt's were the matter of his free choice, what He might have refus'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. Upon which, and other like grounds, how plain is it, That the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt are not in all reſpects Commenſurate to the Sufferings of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that however they have ſuch a reſpect to ſin, on account whereof they may <hi>not unaptly</hi> be call'd <hi>Puniſhments</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf aſſerts, <hi>Method. Theol.</hi> Part III. p. 38.) yet they have not altogether the ſame reſpect to Sin, as the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33442:71"/>
Sinners own Sufferings have, or would have had (as appears before) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we call 'em Puniſhments, we muſt not take ſo much into the Notion of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> as when we call the Sinners own Sufferings by that name.</p>
               <p>§. 8. So that when the Sufferings of Chriſt are compar'd with thoſe of Sinners, we ſay, they are leſs Properly and Analogically call'd Puniſhments not in that Primary and moſt Famous ſenſe in which the Sinners own ſufferings are ſo call'd: and yet when we compare the ſame ſufferings with meer <hi>Calamities,</hi> that have no relation to Sin, or guilt; we ſay, they are not unaptly, but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough</hi> to be call'd <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> for that they had ſuch a reſpect to Sin, as has been before-ſaid. In this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baxt. Two Diſputat. of Original Sin,</hi> p. 156.</note> is plain: and therefore elſewhere Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, That his <hi>(i. e.</hi> Chriſts) ſufferings were <hi>truly Puniſhments</hi> becauſe for ſin, though not for his own; yet <hi>not Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> in ſo full and ſtrict a Senſe as ours, who ſuffer for <hi>our own ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. And hence it appears, that our Accuſer has with no juſt reaſon, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as agreeing with <hi>Crellius</hi> in this matter: <hi>Crellius</hi> (ſays he) ſays the ſame, only with this Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> that it muſt be taken <hi>materially</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:33442:71"/>
and <hi>Improperly</hi> which is the ſenſe in which Mr. <hi>Baxter—</hi>takes it. <hi>Appeal, p.</hi> 27. But beſides that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (ſo far as yet appears) no where ſays, that the ſufferings of Chriſt are Puniſhments <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially</hi> only, (as this Accuſer intimates) nay, on the contrary, he argues from their participating in the <hi>formal Reaſon</hi> of Puniſhment, that they may properly enough be ſo call'd, <hi>Quoad nomen vero, non inepte poena dicuntur, dum ad Peccatum habent, relationem</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Baxter ubi ſupra.</hi> I ſay, beſides this, any conſidering and unprejudic'd Reader will eaſily ſee, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve, that if at any time they happen both to uſe one and the ſame Term, they yet intend it in a vaſtly differing Senſe. So if <hi>Crellius</hi> allow Chriſt's ſufferings to be <hi>Puniſhments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</hi> ſo call'd; it is moſt evident he thereby excludes that reſpect they had to Sin, to our Sin, which we have in the fore-going Chapter aſſerted and clear'd, and in reference to which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and all the Orthodox are agreed: and ſo alſo when he calls our Sins the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of Chriſt's Sufferings, he means it not as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does, of ſuch an Occaſion as was (ſo far as the Nature of the thing will admit) a meritorious Cauſe of 'em alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:33442:72"/>
And it may as well be ſaid that <hi>Crellius</hi> ſays the ſame with <hi>Grotius,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, becauſe he ſometimes calls our Sins the <hi>Impulſive</hi> cauſe of Chriſt's ſufferings; and that his <hi>ſenſe</hi> is the ſame with their's, becauſe ſometimes his words are ſo; and therefore alſo, that their ſenſe is the ſame with his, and thereupon that they are <hi>Socinians:</hi> I ſay, there is the ſame Reaſon why they might alſo, as well as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> be thus repreſented by our Accuſer, for that they alſo ſometimes uſe <hi>Crellius</hi>'s words without any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Nor is it any uncommon thing, for ſeveral Perſons, to uſe the ſame words in differing ſenſes: Our Accuſer himſelf affords us a moſt convincing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to this purpoſe, in reference to the very matter before us. <hi>The ſufferings of Chriſt are to be conſider'd as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, a Proper Puniſhment.</hi> In the Expreſſion the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and our Accuſer are agreed; but that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the ſenſe intended by the one, and the other is not the ſame. He pretends indeed <hi>p.</hi> 38. that it is <hi>not the Words and Phraſes,</hi> but his Lordſhip's <hi>ſound ſence,</hi> that he contends for; but if that were all he would have, there was no occaſion for him to contend at all;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33442:72"/>
that having never (by thoſe he Accuſes) been call'd in Queſtion: where he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended a difference betwixt his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at the moſt, it could be but a Verbal one, that their ſence, when they explain themſelves, does well agree, has been already manifeſted; and ſince Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did, and we do moſt Entirely agree, that <hi>Chriſt's ſuffeings were a Proper Puniſhment,</hi> according to the Notion his Lordſhip, gives us of ſuch a Puniſhment, we may ſurely hope for an End of this Contention.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Only for a Cloſe, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark it to our Accuſer, That whilſt (either through Prejudice, or Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency) he groundleſly charges us as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that Judicious and Right Reverend Perſon; he does himſelf give Occaſion, for any one to return back the Charge, with greateſt Juſtice, upon him. For under the pretence, That Chriſt's Sufferings were a <hi>proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (for which he alledges the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter)</hi> he wou'd have 'em to be the <hi>very Puniſhment</hi> we had deſerv'd, the very <hi>Puniſhment</hi> the Law threatned, <hi>Puniſhment</hi> inflicted by vertue of the Sanction of the violated Law. <hi>V.</hi> p. 23, 26, 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Notion almoſt runs throughout his <hi>Appeal.</hi> But this is

ſo far from being the <hi>ſound Senſe,</hi> in which his Lordſhip has us'd this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that 'tis what he does moſt directly diſpute againſt.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And whereas he does once and again Inſinuate, That 'tis neceſſary Chriſt's Sufferings ſhould be truly and <hi>properly</hi> Penal (we muſt ſuppoſe he means it in his own, not in the Biſhop's Senſe) in Order to their being a proper <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to God's Juſtice for our Sins: 'tis (as has bin already, in ſome meaſure, manifeſted) utterly ſubverſive of the True, and Univerſally own'd Doctrine of Chriſt's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> to aſſert his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to have been Penal, in any ſuch Senſe, as would inferr or include their having been inflicted by vertue of the violated Law, undergone in the proper Perſon of Sinners, their having been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally the ſame we were oblig'd to, and moſt immediately and properly deſerv'd by our Sins; while yet this is what he every where pleads for: But of this Point of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> we deſign (God aſſiſting) to treat more diſtinctly and at large hereafter.</p>
