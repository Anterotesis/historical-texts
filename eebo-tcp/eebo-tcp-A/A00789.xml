            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FYrste, the Joyes and pleasures of this lyfe, be they neuer so great, yet they haue a werynesse and a fastydyousenes with them adioyned, whereby men at length of tyme be wery of theym, as thus. There is no meate nor drynke so delycate, so pleasaunt, so delectable, but yf a man or a woman be longe accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therwith, he shal haue at the length a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes thereof.

And in lyke maner it was of those goodly sygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes whiche were had and done beyonde the see.

And suche a kynge that had tastyd soo many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and of the moost exquysyte, and had suche a great wysdom to deserue them dyd thus say: we may well be assured that there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this worlde so perfyte, but that fynally it hath a werynesse, a fastydyousnes, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry displeasure adioyned therunto.</p>
               <p>¶ But contrary wyse it is of the Joyes of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyn / for they be pure, clene, and parfyte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outen any admyxture of dyspleasure or wery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

For the whiche saynt Peter calleth it (<hi>Immarcessibilem</hi>) The pleasure of heuyn wydderyth nat nor corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyth nat for any longe tyme.

And verely of suche plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures aryseth theyr owne dystruccyon at the ende / the whiche dyd ryght well appere in the pleasaunt syghtes wherof I spake before. For by the reason of them, great money was spent, many great mennes coffers were emptyed / &amp; many were brought to a great ebbe &amp; pouerty. This ebbe caused a greater flowe of Couytyse afterwarde in many mennes hartes. Sumof them were the syker &amp; the weker in theyr body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp; dyuers toke theyr deth therby.

Thus, many for these pleasures were the worse, bothe in theyr bodyes &amp; in theyr soules. ¶ But the pleasures of heuyn be after another maner. No man is enpayred by theym. There is no dred of pouerty / there is no gredynesse of Couytyse / there is no wekenes of any maner of sykenesse, nor feare of any maner of dethe.

If thou do so thynk I fere me that thou shalt be sore beceyued / and that for two reasons especyall.</p>
               <p>¶ The fyrst is this. Yf thou to whome thyne owne soule ought to haue ben moost dere (as I haue sayd) forget the welth therof and made it to folow thy vayne desyres, and take no care ne study for this present tyme here for the delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the same out of Purgatory, what mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uell is it yf other do forget the same after thy dethe. For how mayst thou thynke that any other shall be more dylygent for thy soule than thou thy selfe was? Thy soule can nat be more dere to any other, than it was vnto thy selfe. And therfore yf thou be thus neglygent therof, thynke nat that any other shalbe more dylyge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t than thy selfe was for thyne owne soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5928:16"/>¶ The seconde reason is this. Thou mayst ryght well and easely perceyue that other of thy frendes haue soules of theyr owne whiche of ryght must be more dere vnto them than is thy soule / and that of theyr owne soules they must be more myndefull than of thy soule / or els they be ryght vnwyse.</p>
               <p>¶ Forthermore thou mayst consider that euery man hath ynough to do to satysfy for his owne synnes. And therfore as our sauyour tellyth in a parable. whan the fyue folyssh vyrgyns wold haue borowed som oyle of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other fyue vyrgyns for theyr lampes agaynst the comynge of theyr great spouse.

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THyrdly I say that any man may more merytoryousty helpe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte his owne soule whan that he is here lyuynge, than any other frende of his after his dethe. For now is the tyme of merytynge. And after this lyfe whan the nyghnes of dethe is come, thou canst meryt no more. And therfore our sauyour sayth (<hi>Veniet ante<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nox qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do nemo potest operari</hi>). whan deth is comen ones, farewell the tyme of merytoryouse workynge.</p>
               <p>¶ I wyll nat say the contrary but thy frendes
<pb facs="tcp:5928:16"/>
prayers after thy dethe may moche profyte the: Neuerthelesse I say that thyne owne prayers as deuoutly sayd for thy selfe here in this lyfe, sholde haue profyted vnto the moche more. For as all the dysputers agree, the hyghest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fruyte in euery mannes prayer retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto hym selfe. And it is but a secondary fruyt that retourneth into other.</p>
               <p>¶ Now therfore chrysten man whyles thou art in this lyfe, and whyle thou haste tyme and space. Study to make amendes for thy synnes. Study to store thy soule by trew contrycyon and sorow for thy synnes. Study here for to wasshe the same often with the gracyouse wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of teares. Study to clense thy soule with often renewynge of thy confessyon. Study here by thy good and gracyouse workes to pay thyne owne dettys before thy departure hence. Study to kepe the commaundementes of god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the whiche thou can nat entre into the kyngdome of heuyn. Be now redy to forgyue al iniuryes and wronges done vnto the, that there by almyghty god may the rather forgyue the suche trespasses or iniuryes as thou haste before tyme commytted vnto hym. Praye for thy selfe fast. For thy selfe gyue almesse. For thy selfe pray, and procure other to pray for the lyke wyse. Better is now one peny spent for the welth and saluacyon of thy soule whan thou mayst kepe it vnto thy selfe, than a thousande after thy dethe whan thou mayst no longer haue the vse the vse therof. ¶ Do thus, &amp; by the
<pb facs="tcp:5928:17"/>
grace of god thou shalt eschew that paynefull pryson. ¶ Do thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy soule shall be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syd &amp; stored agaynst thy departure out of this worlde, that thou shalt without any longe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes or taryenge by the way, be receyued into the Joyous kyngdome / where thou shalt se the gloryouse syghtes of that moste wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey, and be made partyner of the moost excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Joyes and pleasures whiche there euery where dothe abounde, and euer shall endure / to the which he brynge vs that for vs all dyed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the crosse, our sauyour.

The Courte of kynge Edwarde, the Courte of kynge Rycharde, &amp; the courte of the kynge that now is ded / where be they now? all they were but counterfeyt ymages and dysguysynge for a tyme / it was but a playe for a tyme. But the courte of heuyn is alway stable in one poynte / where the offycers chaunge neuer. There is the true noblenesse, the sure honour, the very glory. This glory, this honour, this noblenes, we shal neuer se, we shal neuer come vnto it, oneles our lyfe be more ryghtwyse than was the lyues of the Jewes. ¶ A sore worde, a sore threte, neuer theles it is true. These be nat my wordes, these be nat my thretes, I wrote nat these wordes in the Gospels. The holy Euangelist wrote them, our sauyour Chryste Jesu spake them / they be his wordes that can nat lye / they be his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that may perfourme them.</p>
            <p>¶ Oh crysten soule, marke well these wordes, ponder theym, wey them / thynke what it is to be excludyd from that place of all pleasure, and to be throwen into the moost horryble donge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hell, from the whiche thou shalt neuer be delyuered.

But whan he dothe awake out of his dreme, and fyndeth none of all these thynges, he is a sory man. Suche dremes many men haue had before this.</p>
            <p>¶ Francys Petrarke wrytyth hym selfe that he had suche a dreme / and that he had founde a great heuy hurde full of golde / and he had great sorowe and care for the conueyaunce of the same / but as soone as he awaked out his slepe, his treasour was gone. So longe as such a dreme lastyth, who is more ioyouse than such a man is, in his owne oppinyon? who is more ioyous than he is in his owne fantasy?. But al that is but fantasye in dede / it is but a very dreme. And so whan he is awakyd out of his slepe, he fyndeth it in very trouthe / and than perceyueth he ryght well that all that, was but a fantasy.</p>
