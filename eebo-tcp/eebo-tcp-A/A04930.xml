            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue I saide vnto you, that I looked dayly for
trouble, and that I wondred at it, that so long
I did escape it? What mooued me to refuse,
and that with displeasure of al men, euen of
those that best loued mee, those high promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that were offered by him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs for our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces? Assuredly the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of troubles to come. How oft haue I said
vnto you that the time woulde not bee long,
that England woulde giue mee bread? Aduise
with the last letter, that I wrote vnto your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in lawe, &amp; consider, what is therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22752:7"/>While I had this trouble, you had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
sent (I doubt not) to vs both of God: that
in that great rest, and (as we cal it) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
triumphed, we should not bee so carelesse
and so insolent, as others were. Who albeit
they professed Christe in mouth, yet sought
they nothing but the worlde with hand, with
foote, with counsel and wisedome. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
at this present our comfort appeareth not,
yet before all the plagues be powred foorth, it
shalbe known that there is a God, who taketh
care for his owne. Secondarily is to be noted,<note place="margin">God his very elect sometimes accuse God.</note>
that the nature and ingenie of the very sonnes
of God in the time of their trouble, is, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
vnto God som other affection, then there
is or can be in him towardes his children. And
sometime to complaine vpon God, as that he
did those things that in very deede hee cannot
doe, to his elect. Dauid &amp; Iob often complaine
that God hath left them, was become their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie,
regarded not their praiers, &amp; tooke no
heede to deliuer them. And yet vnpossible it
is, that God either shal leaue his chosen, or
that hee shal despise the humble petitions of
suche, as doe call vpon his support. But suche
complaints are the voices of the flesh, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God is not offended, to the forsaking &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:22752:8"/>
reiection of his elect, but pardoneth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other innumerable infirmities &amp; sinnes.
And therefore (dearely beloued) dispaire you
not, albeit the fleshe sometime burst out
into heauie complaints, as it were accusing
God: you are not more perfect then was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
and Iob. And you cannot bee so perfect
as Christ himselfe was, who vppon the crosse
cried: My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me? Consider, deare mother, how lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and horrible were these wordes, to the
onely sonne of God. And Dauid in the 88. Psal.
(which for better vnderstanding, I desire you
reade) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth vpon God, that night &amp; day
he had cried, and that yet he was not deliuered
But (saith he) my soule is replenished with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
I am as a man without strength. I am like
vnto those that are gone downe into the pit,
of whom thou hast no more minde, like vnto
those that are cut of by thy hande: Thou hast
put mee in a deepe dungeon, al thy wrath lieth
vpon mee: Why leauest thou me, Lorde? why
hydest thou thy face from me? thou hast remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
al my freendes from mee, thou hast made
mee odious vntoo them. And thus hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his Psalme and complainte without
mention of any comfort at al receiued. And
<pb facs="tcp:22752:8"/>
Iob in diuers places of his booke maketh
euen the like complaintes, sometime saying,
that God was his enimie, and had set him as it
were a marke to shoote at, and therefore that
his soule desired the very destruction.</p>
               <p>These things I recite vnto you, deerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
vnderstanding what haue beene your
troubles heeretofore: and knowing that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
wil not cease nowe to perswade to your
tender conscience, that none of God his elect
hath beene in like case as you are, but by these
presidentes and many other places, which now
to collect I haue no opportunitie, it plainely
doth appeare that God his chosen vessels haue
suffered the like temptations. I remember that
ofte you haue complained vpon the grudging
and murmuring that you founde, which in
your selfe fearing that it prouoked God to
more displeasure: Beholde and consider deere
mother, what God hath borne with his saintes
before: wil hee not beare the same with you,
beeing most sorie for your imperfections? Hee
cannot other wise do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But as his wisedome
hath made vs al of one masse and nature, earth
and earthly: and as hee hath redeemed vs with
one price, the blood of his only sonne, so hee
according to his promise like mercifully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth
<pb facs="tcp:22752:9"/>
doneth the offences of al those that cal vpon
the name of the Lorde Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> of those I
meane that refuse all other Iustice but his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>But to our matter of these presidents,
plaine it is that God his elect, before you haue
suffered the like crosse, as presentlie you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that they haue complained as you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
that they haue thought themselues ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
as you haue thought, and yet may thinke
your selfe: and yet neuerthelesse they were
sure in GOD his fauour. Hope deare mother
and looke you for the same, hope I say against
hope.</p>
               <p>Howe horrible the paine is to suffer that
crosse, can none expresse, except such as haue
prooued it: feareful it is for the very payne it
selfe: but most feareful it is, for that the godlie
so tormented, iudge God to bee angrie, in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and in rage against them, as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Seeing wee haue founde this crosse
to appertaine to God his children, profitable
it shalbe, and necessarie to searche out the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the same. Plaine it is that not only God
worketh al to the profite of his elect, but also
that hee woorketh it of such loue towardes
<pb facs="tcp:22752:9"/>
them and with such wisedome, that otherwise
thinges coulde not bee: and this to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande,
is very profitable, partly to satisfie the
grudging complaintes of the fleshe, which in
trouble commonly doeth question, Why doth
God this or that? And albeeit the fleshe in
this earth can neuer bee fully satisfied: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as hunger and thirst from time to time
assaulteth it, so doe others more grosse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
yet the inwarde man which sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
vnto God (knowing the causes why the
very iust are so troubled and torm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nted in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and spirite in this life) receiueth some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
and getteth some stay of God his mercie,
by knowing the causes of the trouble. Al cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may I not heere recite: but twoo or three
of the principal wil I touche.</p>
               <p>The first is to prouoke in God his elect an
ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed of sinne, and vnfainedly repentance of
the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the which cause if it were rightly
considered, were sufficient to make all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all
and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>porall troubles tollerable vnto
vs. For seeing it is so that without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
no man doeth attaine to GOD his
mercie (for it is now appointed by him whose
wisedome is infinite, I meane of those
that are conuerted to the feeling of sinne)
<pb facs="tcp:22752:10"/>
and that without mercie no man can come to
ioy: is not that which causeth vs to vnderstand
what repentance is, gladly to bee receiued and
imbraced? Repentance conteineth within it a
knowledge of sinne, a dolour for it, and a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of it togither with hope of mercy.</p>
               <p>It is very euident that God his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue not at al times the right knowledge
of sinne: that is to say, how odious it is before
God: Much lesse haue they the dolour of it, &amp;
hatred of it. Which if they had, as they could
not sinne, so coulde they neuer be able, hauing
that same very sense of God his wrath against
sinne, to delight in any thing that appertaineth
to the fleshe, more then the woman whome
God hath appointed by the helpe of man, to
produce mankind, coulde euer delight in man,
if at al times shee felt the same pangues of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and paine, that she doeth in her childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrth.
And therefore doeth God for such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
as are knowne to himselfe, sometime
suspend from his owne children, this fore saide
sense and feeling of his wrath against sinne.
As no doubte, heere hee did with Dauid, not
onely before his sinne, but also sometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22752:10"/>But least the sonnes of God shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
altogither insolent like the children of
the world, he sendeth vnto them some portion
of this foresaide cuppe: in drinking whereof
they come to such knowledge as they neuer
had before. For first they feele the wrath of
God working against sinne: whereby they
learne the iustice of God, to bee euen such as
he himselfe pronounceth that he may suffer no
sinne vnpunished. And thus begin they as well
to morne for their offences, as also to hate the
same, which otherwise they coulde neuer doe:
for nothing is so pleasing to the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man, as is sinne: and things pleasing to
nature, cannot nature of it selfe hate.</p>
               <p>But in this conflict, as God his childr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feele
torments, and those most grieuous, as they
mourne, and by God his holie spirite begin to
hate sinne: so come they also to a more high
knowledge: that is, that man cannot bee saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to himselfe, for how shal hee saue himselfe
from hel, that cannot saue himselfe from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and trouble heere in the flesh, while hee
yet hath strength, wit, reason, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
and therefore must hee bee compelled in
his heart, to acknowledge, that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mediatour betweene God his iustice and
<pb facs="tcp:22752:11"/>
mankind, then any that euer descended of the
corrupt state of Adam, yea then any creature,
that onlie is a creature: and by the knowledge
of this mediatour at the last, the afflicted
commeth by some sense and liuely feeling of
God his great mercie declared vnto mankinde,
albeeit they bee not so sensible as is the paine:
and albeeit that torment by this knowledge is
not hastily remoued, yet hath the patient some
hope, that al dolour shal haue ende: and that
is the cause why hee sobbeth and gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth, for
an ende of paine, why also he blasphemeth not
God, but cryeth for his health euen in the
midst of his anguishe. Howe profitable this is
to the children of God, and what it worketh
in them as the plaine scripture teacheth, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
letteth vs vnderstande.</p>
               <p>Verilie euen so profitable as it is to mourne
for sinne, to hate the same, to knowe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
betwixt God and man, and finally to
knowe his louing mercie towardes them: So
necessarie is it to drinke this foresaide cuppe.
What it worketh in them, none knoweth but
such as taste it.</p>
               <p>In Dauid it is plaine, that it wrought humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and abiection of himselfe.</p>
               <p>It tooke from him the great trust hee had
<pb facs="tcp:22752:11"/>
in himselfe. It made him dayly to feare and
earnestly to pray, that after he shoulde not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in like manner, or bee left in his owne
handes. It made him lowlie, although hee was
a king: it made him merciful, when hee might
haue beene rigorous: Yea and it made him
to mourne for Absolon his wicked sonne. But
to the rest of the causes.</p>
               <p>The second cause why God permitteth his
elect to taste of this bitter cuppe, is to raise vp
our hearts from these transitorie vanitles: for
so foolish and forgetful of nature, and so addict
are wee to the things that are present, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee haue another schoolemaister then
manly reason, and some other spurre, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
remembrance, then any which wee can
choose or deuise our selues: Wee neither can
desire, nor yet rightly remember, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from this vaine and wicked worlde, to
the kingdome that is prepared.</p>
               <p>Wee are commanded dayly to praye, Thy
kingdome come: which petition asketh that
sinne may cease, that death may be deuoured,
that transitorie troubles may haue an ende,
that Sathan may bee troden vnder foote, that
the whole body of Christ, may bee restored to
life, libertie, and ioy, that the powers and
<pb facs="tcp:22752:12"/>
kingdomes of this earth may bee resolued and
destroyed. And that God the father may be all
in al thinges after that his sonne Christ Iesus
our Sauiour hath rendred vp the kingdom for
euer.</p>
               <p>These thinges are wee al commaunded to
pray for: but which of vs in the time when al
abundeth with vs (when neither body not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
hath trouble) from our heart, and without
dissimulation can wishe these thinges? verily
none. With our mouth wee may speake the
wordes, but the heart cannot thirst the thinges
to come, except we be in such state that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things be vnsauerie vnto vs. And so can they
neuer be but vnder the Crosse. Neither yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
al kind of Crosses as are worldly things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant:
for in pouertie riches do greately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
many. For although they lacke them, yet
desire they to haue them: and so are they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnsauerie nor vnpleasant. For things that
wee earnestly couet, are not vnpleasant vnto
vs. But when things appertaining to the flesh,
are sufficiently ministred vnto vs, and yet none
of them can molifie our anguishe nor paine:
then sobbeth the heart vnto God, and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
wisheth an ende of miserie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our heauenly father of his infinite wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:22752:12"/>
to holde vs in continual remembrance,
that in this wretched worlde there is no rest,
permitteth and suffereth vs to bee tempted
and tryed with this crosse, that with an vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
hart we may desire not only an end of our
troubles (for that shal come to vs by death) but
also of al the troubles of the churche of God,
which shal not bee before the comming again
of the Lorde Iesus.</p>
               <p>The thirde cause I collect of Moses wordes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to the Israelites, saying, The Lorde thy God
shal cast out these nations by little and little
before thee. Hee wil not cast them out all at
once, lest perchaunce the wilde beasts be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
against thee: And also when thou shalt
enter into that lande, and shalt dwell in the
houses, that thou neuer buildest, and that thou
shalt eate and bee filled: giue thankes vnto the
Lorde thy God, and beware that thou forget
him not, and that thou say not in thy hearte:
The strength of mine own hand hath brought
these great riches vnto mee.</p>
               <p>In these woordes are twoo thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
vnto our matter most worthie to bee
noted. First that Moses saieth that the Lorde
will not at once, but by little and little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
those nations, adding the cause, least
<pb facs="tcp:22752:13"/>
perchaunce (saith hee) the wilde beastes bee
multiplied, and make vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o are against thee. The
seconde that when they had abundance that
then they shoulde declare themselues minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of God his benefites, and that they should
not thinke that their owne power, wisedome,
nor prouision was any cause that they had the
fruition of those commodities.</p>
               <p>By these Presidents the holy Ghost teacheth
them, that like as they did not possesse, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the first interest of that lande by their
owne strength, but that the Lorde God did
freelie giue it to them, so likewise were they
not able to brooke nor enioy the same, by any
power of themselues.</p>
               <p>For albeeit that God shoulde haue in one
moment destroied al their enemies: yet if hee
shoulde not haue beene their perpetual safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
the wilde beastes, shoulde haue troubled
them. And if they had demaunded the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
why wilt thou not destroy the wild beasts
also? he answereth, least thou forget the Lorde
thy God, and say in thy heart, my strength hath
obtained this quietnesse to my selfe.</p>
               <p>Consider, deerely beloued, that such things
as the spirite of God foresawe dangerous and
damnable vnto them, the same things are to be
<pb facs="tcp:22752:13"/>
feared in vs: for al things happened vnto them
in figures. They were in Egypt corporally puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by a cruel tyrant: wee were in spirituall
bondage of the Deuil, by sinne and increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
God gaue to them a land that flowed with
milke and hony, for which they neuer labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
God hath opened to vs, the knowledge of
Christ Iesus which we neuer deserued, nor yet
hoped for the same. They were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
the land, after they were possessed in it:
wee are not able, to retaine our selues, in the
true knowledge of Christ, but by his grace
onelie. Some enimies were left to exercise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Sinne is left in vs, that we may learne to fight.
If enemies had not beene, wilde beasts should
haue multiplied amongest them. If such
beastes as wee thinke most doe trouble vs,
were not permitted so to doe, worse beastes
shoulde haue dominion ouer vs, that is to
wit: Trust in our selfe, arrogancie, obliuion, &amp;
forgetfulnes of that estate from which GOD
hath deliuered vs, togither with a light estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Christes merites, which sinnes are
the beastes that (alas do deuour no smal nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither yet let any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke, that if al
kinde of crosses were taken from vs, during
<pb facs="tcp:22752:14"/>
the time that wee beare the earthly Image of
Adam, that wee shoulde bee more perfect in
vsing the spiritual giftes of God: to wit, the
remission of sinnes, his free grace, and Christ
his iustice, for which wee neuer laboured:
than that people shoulde haue beene, in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of those corporall giftes. And Moyses
saith vnto them, Beware that thou forget not
the Lorde thy God. Hee who knoweth the
secretes of heartes, giueth not his preceptes
in vaine: if man his hearte had not beene
prone and readie to forget God, and to glorie
in his owne strength, God had not giuen this
precept, and repeated it so diligently. For hee
neither doeth nor speaketh in vaine, but
knowing what thinges be most able to blinde
and deceiue man, the wisedome of God by
his contrarie preceptes, giueth him warning
of the same. Experience hath taught vs
howe such beastes haue troubled the churche
of God: to speake nothing of the time of the
Prophetes, of the Apostles, or of the primitiue
church.</p>
               <p>What trouble made Pelagius by his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie?
affirming that man by natural power
and free wil, might fulfil the lawe of GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:22752:14"/>
and deserue for himselfe remission and grace.
And to come a little neere to our owne age,
hath it not beene openly preached and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in schooles, and set out by writings, that
onelie faith doeth not iustifie, but that workes
doe also iustifie? Hath it not beene taught, that
good workes may goe before faith, and may
prouoke God to giue his graces? What hath
beene taught of man his merites, and of the
workes of supererogation: some openly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that some men haue wrought more
good woorkes, then were necessarie to their
owne saluation? I pray you consider if these
men saide not: our hande and our strength
hath giuen these thinges vnto vs. What were
these Diuelishe heresies, and others that haue
infected the whole Papistrie? Assuredly they
were cruel and rauenous beastes, able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
the soules of al those vpon whome they
get the vpper hande: but the mercifull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our God, willing our saluation, wil
not suffer vs, to come to that vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and obliuion. And therefore heere hee
permitteth vs, of our enemies, with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Paule to be suffered, to the ende that wee
may mourne for sinne, and hate the same, that
<pb facs="tcp:22752:15"/>
we may knowe the onelie mediatour, and the
dignitie of his office, that we may vnfaynedly
thirst the comming of the Lorde Iesus, and
that wee neither bee presumptuous, lightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
Christ his death: neither yet vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of out former estate and miseries. And so
this cuppe is as it were a medicine prepared by
the wisedome of our eternal Phisition, who
onelie knoweth the remedies of our corrupt
nature. Aduerte and marke, deere mother, that
al commeth to vs, for our most singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.
It is a medicine, and therefore presently it
cannot bee pleasing. But howe gladly woulde
wee vse, and receiue, when the bodies were
sicke, how vnpleasant &amp; bitter soeuer it were,
to drinke, that medicine which would remoue
sicknesse, &amp; restore health? But Oh how much
more ought wee, with patience and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
to receiue this medicine of our fathers
handes, that from our soule remoueth many
mortal diseases, his holy Ghost so working by
the same: such as is pride, presumption, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of grace, and vnthankefulnesse? which
bee the very mortal diseases, that by vnbeliefe
doe kil the soule: And doeth restore vnto vs

me not to rehearse. God graunt that the
eyes of men be not blinded to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But to our purpose, deerely beloued, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
this cuppe from the handes of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father, and albeit your paines bee almost
intollerable, yet cast your selfe, because you
haue none other refuge, before the throne of
God his mercie, and with the Prophet Dauid
being in like trouble, say vnto him:</p>
               <q>2 Haue mercie vpon me, O Lorde, for I
am weake, O Lord, heare me, for al
my bones are vexed.</q>
               <p>Nowe procedeth Dauid in his prayer, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
certaine causes, why he should bee heard,
and obtaine his petitions: but first wee wil
speake of his prayers as they bee in order
through this whole Psalme. Dauid in summ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
desireth 4. things, in this his vehem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t trouble:
<pb facs="tcp:22752:16"/>
in the first verse hee asketh that God-punishe
him not in his heauie displeasure and wrath.</p>
               <p>In the seconde verse hee asketh that GOD
should haue mercie vpon him: and in the third
verse he desireth that he should heale him: and
in the fourth verse he asketh that God should
returne vnto him, and that he should saue his
soule: euerie one of these things, were so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
vnto Dauid, that lacking any one of
them, hee iudgeth himselfe vnfortunate. Hee
felt the wrath of God, and therefore desired
the same to be remoued, he had offended and
therefore desired mercie, hee was falne in
most dangerous sicknesse, and therefore he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for corporal health: God appeared to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from him, and therfore desired hee that
the comfort of the holy Ghost should returne
vnto him. And thus was Dauid, not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie
are the most parte of men in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who of a custome, oftentimes doe aske
with their mouths such things, as their hearts
doe not greatly desire to obtaine. But let vs
marke principally, what things are to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in these his praiers: which he with earnest
minde powred forth before God. Euident it
is, that Dauid in these his prayers susteined
and felt the very sense of God his wrath:
<pb facs="tcp:22752:16"/>
And also that hee vnderstoode clearely that it
was God only, that troubled him, and that had
laide that sore scourge vpon him. And yet no
where els but at God alone (who appeared to
bee angrie with him) seeketh hee support or
aide: this is easie to bee spoken, and the most
part of men wil iudge it but a light matter too
flie to God in their troubles.</p>
               <p>I confesse in deed that if our troubles come
by man his tyranny, that then the most sure, &amp;
most easie way is, to runne to God, for defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and aide.<note place="margin">Let this bee vvel noted.</note> But let God appeare to bee our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
to be angrie with vs, and to haue left vs:
howe harde and difficil is it then to cal for his
grace and for his assistance? None knoweth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such as haue learned it in experience, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet can any man so doe, except the elect
children of God:<note place="margin">Enimies driue vs from God vnder this crosse.</note> for so strong are the enimies,
that with great violence inuade the troubled
conscience, in that trouble some battel, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the hid seede of God shoulde make them
hope against hope, they coulde neuer looke for
any deliuerance or comfort. The fleshe lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not reasons and perswasions, to bring vs
from God. The Diuel by him selfe, and by
his messengers, dare boldly say, and affirme:
that we haue nothing to doe with God. And a
<pb facs="tcp:22752:17"/>
weake faith, is oft compelled to confesse both
the accusations, and reasons to be most true.
In time of trouble the fleshe doeth reason. O
wretched man, perceiuest thou not that God
is angrie with thee? Hee plagueth thee in his
hot displeasure, therefore it is in vaine for thee
to cal vpon him. The Diuel by his suggestion,
or by his ministers doeth amplifie and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
these presidents, affirming &amp; beating into
the conscience of the sore afflicted, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
God plagueth thee for thine iniquitie,
thou hast offended his holy lawe, therefore it
is labour lost to crie for mercy or reliefe, for
his iustice must needes take vengeance vpon al
inobedient offendours. In this meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a weake faith is compelled to confesse and
acknowledge the accusations to be most true,
for who can deny that hee hath not deserued
God his punishments. The fleshe feeleth the
torments, and our owne weakenesse crieth all
is true, and no point can be denied. The vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
of this battel in the sicknesse of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,
and in the historie of Iob, plainely may
bee espied.<note place="margin">Esay. 38.</note> Exechias after that with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
teares, hee had complained that his life
was taken away, and cut of before his time,
that violence was doone vnto him, and that
<pb facs="tcp:22752:17"/>
God had bruised al his bones like a Lion: At
last hee saith, Be thou suretie for me, O Lord:
but immediately vpon these woordes, as it
were correcting himselfe, hee saith: What shal
I say, it is he that hath done it. As who would
say, to what purpose complaine I to him? If he
had any pleasure in mee, hee woulde not haue
entreated mee on this manner. It is hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
whome I thought shoulde haue been my
suretie and defender, that hath wrapped me in
al this wretched miserie: Hee cannot bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie,
and merciful at once (so iudgeth the flesh)
for in him there is no contrarietie, I feele
him to bee angrie with mee, and therefore it is
in vaine, that I complain or cal vpon him. This
also may bee espied in Iob, who after that hee
was accused by his freendes, as one that had
deserued the plague of God, and after that his
wise had willed him to refuse al iustice, and to
curse God,<note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> and so to die: after his most gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
complaintes, hee saith. When I called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and hee hath answered, yet beleeue I
not that hee hath hearde my voice: As if Iob
woulde say, So terrible are my tormentes, so
vehemement is my paine, and anguishe, that
albeit verily GOD had hearde my humble
<pb facs="tcp:22752:18"/>
petitions, yet feele I not that he wil graunt me
my request. Heere is a strong battel, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
they vnderstande that remedie is none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but in God onely, and yet from Gods hande
they looke for no support, as might appeare to
mens iudgements: for he that saith, that God
punisheth him, and therefore cannot bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
and hee doubteth whether God heare
him or not, appeareth to haue cast away all
hope of Gods deliuerance. These thinges put
I you in minde of, beloued mother, that albeit
your paines sometime bee so horrible, that no
release nor comfort you find, neither in spirite,
nor body: yet if the heart can onely sobbe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, dispaire not, you shal obteine your
heartes desire: And destitute yee are not of
faith. For at such time as the flesh, natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the lawe of God, the present torment, and
the Diuel at once doeth crie: God is angrie,
and therefore is there neither helpe nor reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
too bee hoped for at his handes: at suche
time I say, to sobbe vnto God, is the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the secrete seede of God, which is
hid in Gods elect children, and that only sobbe
is vnto God a more acceptable sacrifice, than
without this crosse to giue our bodies to bee
burned, euen for the truethes sake. For if God
<pb facs="tcp:22752:18"/>
bee present by assistance of his holy spirite, so
that no doubt is in our conscience, but that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
we stande in Gods fauour, what can
corporal trouble hurt the soule or mind, seeing
the bitter frostie wind cannot hurt the body it
selfe, which is most warmely couered, and clad
from violence of the colde. But when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of God appeareth to bee absent, yea when
God himselfe appeareth to be our enimie, then
to say, Oh (to thinke with Iob in his trouble)
albeit he should destroy or kill mee, yet will I
trust in him: or what is the strength and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
of the faith, which so looketh for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when the whole man feeleth nothing but
dolours on euery side. Assuredly that hope
shal neuer bee confounded, for so it is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by him, who cannot repent of his mercy &amp;
goodnesse: Reioyce Mother, and fight to the
end, for sure I am that ye are not vtterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of that spirite, who taught Dauid &amp; Iob.
What obedience I haue hearde you giue vnto
God in your most strong torment, it needeth
mee not to write, only I desire (which is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my dayly prayer,) God for our Iesus
Christe his sonnes sake, that in al your trouble
you may continue, as I haue left you, and that
with Dauid yee may sobbe. Albeit the mouth
<pb facs="tcp:22752:19"/>
may not speak, yet let the heart grone and say,
Haue mercy vpon mee O Lorde, and heale me,
and then I nothing doubt, your greeuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shal not molest you for euer, but shortly
shal haue an ende to your euerlasting consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and comfort. Yee thinke peraduenture,
that ye would gladly cal and pray for mercy,
but the knowledge of your sinnes doe hinder
you. Consider, dearely beloued, that al Phisick
or medicine serueth onely for the patient: so
doeth mercy onely for the sinner, yea for the
wretched and most miserable sinner. Did not
Dauid vnderstande himselfe to bee a sinner,<note place="margin">Obiection of the fleshe.</note> &amp;
an adulterer,<note place="margin">Ansvvere by a similitude.</note> and a shedder of innocent blood?
Yea, knewe hee not also that he was punished
for his sinnes? Yes verily, he did, and therfore
he called for mercy: which hee that knoweth
not the heauines and multitude of sinnes can
in no wise doe, but most commonly doth des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
mercy when it is offered, or at the least the
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feeleth not the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sin, lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
mercy, because he feeleth not how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is vnto him, as betwixt Christ &amp; the
proude Pharisees, in many places of the newe
Testament, it is to be seen. And therfore, deare
mother, if your aduersary trouble you, either
with your sinnes past or present, obiecting, the
<pb facs="tcp:22752:19"/>
mercy apperteineth not vnto you by reason of
your sinnes: answer, to him as you are taught
by Christ, That the whole needeth no Phisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
neither yet the iust, mercy &amp; pardon. But that
Christ is come to giue light to the blind, &amp; to
cal sinners to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
your selues to be the greatest, &amp; yet that
ye doubt nothing to obteine mercy, because it
was neuer denied to none that asketh the same
in faith. And thus no doubt yee shal obteine
victorie by Christ Iesus, to whom be praise for
euer and euer, Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the rest of Dauids praiers, now will we
bee shorter, that wee may come to the
groundes of the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the desiring of mercy, nowe desireth
Dauid a corporal benefite, saying, Heale mee,
Lorde. Heereof is to bee noted, that bodily
health being the gift of God, may bee asked of
him without sinne, albeit that wee vnderstand
our selues to bee punished for our offences.
Neither yet in so praying, are wee contrary to
Gods will: for his prouidence hath planted in
the nature of man, a desire of health, &amp; a desire
that it may be conserued, &amp; therfore is he not
<pb facs="tcp:22752:20"/>
offended that we aske health of body, when we
lacke it, neither yet that we seeke preseruation
of our health by such ordinary meanes as hee
hath appointed: Prouided alwaies, that God
himselfe be first sought, and that we desire nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, neither health, to the hinderance of
Gods glory nor to the hurt or destruction of
others our brethren, but rather that by vs
Gods glory may bee promoted, &amp; that others
our brethren by our strength, health, and life,
may bee comforted and defended. These pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
nowe rightly obserued, it is no sinne
earnestly to aske at God health of body, albeit
wee knowe our sicknesse to bee the very hand
of God, punishing or correcting our former
euil life. This I write because some are so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere,
that they would not that we should aske
bodily helth of God, because the sicknes is sent
to vs by him: but such men doe not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
vnderstande, neither yet consider that
sicknes is a trouble to the body and that God
commandeth vs to cal for his help in our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Surely our submission and praiers in
such extremitie, is the greatest glory that wee
can giue vnto God: for so doing wee thinke
that his mercy aboundeth aboue his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and so wee are bold to pray for the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:22752:20"/>
of his scourge,<note place="margin">Ier. 18. Marke vve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> which petition no doubt
hee must graunt, for so he promiseth by Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
his Prophet, saying: If I haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against
any nation or Citie, saying that I wil destroy
it, and if it turne from iniquitie and repent, it
shal repent me also of the plagues, that I haue
spoken against it. God promiseth to shewe
mercie to a whole Citie or nation if it repent,
&amp; wil he not doe the same to a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if in his sicknesse he cal for grace? He hath
shewed vnto vs that hee wil, by diuers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and specially by the leprosie of Mary the
sister of Moses and Aaron, which shee receiued
at the Lordes hande, punishing her high and
hautie minde: and againe, vpon her submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and at the prayer of Moses, shee shortly
was restored to health. But to proceed, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
moreouer prayeth: Turne againe O Lord.
It appeareth vnto Dauid, beeing in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of his paine, that God was altogether
departed from him: for so alwaies iudgeth the
flesh (yea the whole man) when trouble wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by any continuance of time. Dauid had
sustained trouble many dayes, hee had prayed
and yet was not deliuered. And therefore iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
he that God being offended for his sinnes
had left him. And yet plain it is that God was
<pb facs="tcp:22752:21"/>
with him, working in his hart by his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expressing forth those sobbes
and grones: as also the desire he had to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to that comfort and consolation, which
somtimes he had felt by the familiaritie, which
he had with God. Al these motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I say, were
the operations of Gods holie spirite: and yet
Dauid could perceiue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sort nor presence
of God, in that his trouble, but lamentably
complaineth, as before you haue heard. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is plaine, that the verie elect sometimes
are without al feeling of consolation: and that
they thinke themselues altogether destitute, as
may be seene in Dauid. But it is chiefly to be
noted, that Dauid in this his anguish remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth,
that God sometimes had bene familiar
with him: for he saieth, Turne again, O Lord,
signifying thereby, that before he had felt the
sweetenesse of Gods presence, but now he was
left to him selfe without feeling of comfort or
consolation. For thus appereth Dauid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine:
Hast thou not bene familiar with mee
O Lorde, thy vnprofitable seruaunt? Diddest
thou not cal me from keeping sheepe, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
King ouer thy people Israel?<note place="margin">In trouble Dauid remebreth vvhat God sometimes bad vvrought by him.</note> Diddest
thou not so incourage my minde, that I feared

yet the deuouring teeth of the hungry Beare?
<pb facs="tcp:22752:21"/>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose iawes I deliuered my sheepe? Didst
not thou once inflame my hart with the zeale
of thy holie name? that when al Israel were so
afraid, that none durst incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with that mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Goliah, yet thy spirit made me so bold and
so valiant, that without harnesse or weapons
(except my slingstaffe &amp; stones) I durst enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
singular battel against him: was it not thy
strength that gaue me victorie, not only at that
time, but also of al other my enimies, that haue
sought my life since? Hast not thou made mee
so glad by the multitude of thy mercies, &amp; thy
most gracious fauor which thou from time to
time most abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly hast powred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, that
both soule &amp; body hath reioyced through the
galdnes of thy countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? hast thou not bin
so effectually with me present in troubles and
dangers, that my very enemies haue known &amp;
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed that thy power was alwaies with me,
and that thou diddest take my defence vppon
thy selfe? and wilt thou now so leaue the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which thou hast chosen? Shal it bee left
desolate for euer? can thy mercies haue an end?
and shal thy fatherly pitie neuer appeare more
vnto me? Shalt thou leaue me for euer thus to
be torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast afore so abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforted? O Lorde, I am sure thy mercies
wil not so entreat me, and therfore turn again
<pb facs="tcp:22752:22"/>
O Lorde, and make mee glad with thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce,
whome of long time thou hast left
voide of consolation &amp; comfort. Aduert and
consider, dearely beloued, in what estate was
Dauid, when that he had none other comfort,
except the only remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods former
benefits shewed vnto him. And therfore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
ye not, nor yet dispaire ye: albeit that you
find your self in the same case that Dauid was.
Sure I am, that your owne heart must confesse
that ye haue receiued like benefits at the hand
of God, as Dauid did. He hath called you from
a more vile office, then from the keeping of
sheepe, to as great a dignitie (touching the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
inheritance) as hee did Dauid. For
from the seruice of the Deuil and sin, hee hath
annointed vs Priestes and Kings, by the blood
of his onely Sonne Iesus: hee hath giuen
you courage and boldnesse to fight against
more cruel, more suttle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more dangerous, and
against enemies that be more nigh vnto you,
then either was the Lyon, the Beare or Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
to Dauid: against the Deuil I meane, and
his assaultes, against your owne fleshe, and
most inwarde affections, against the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of them that were (and yet remaine) ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Christes religion: yea, against some of
<pb facs="tcp:22752:22"/>
your natural friendes, which appeare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
Christ with you, and in that part the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
is the more vehement. What boldnesse I
haue seene with you, in al suche conflictes, it
needeth not me to rehearse. I write this, to the
praise of God, I haue wondred at that bolde
constancie, which I haue found in you at such
time as mine owne heart was fainte. Sure I
am, that fleshe and blood coulde neuer haue
persuaded you, to haue contemned and set at
naught those thinges that the worlde most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth:
you haue tasted and felte of Gods
goodnes and mercies in suche measure, that
not onely ye are able to reason and speake, but
also by the spirite of God working in you, to
giue comfort and consolation to such as were
in trouble: and therefore most deare mother,
thinke not that God wil leaue his own mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for euer. No, impossible it is, that the Deuil
shal occupie Gods inheritance: or yet that God
shal so leaue and forsake his holie Temple that
hee wil not sanctific the same. Againe, God
sometimes suspendeth his own presence from
his elected, as heere by Dauid may be espied:
And verie often suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of his hands, he neither wil nor may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
for so were he a mutable God: &amp; gaue his
glorie to another, if he permitted himself to be
ouercome of his aduersarie: which is as like
impossible, as it is that God shal cease to bee
God. Now lastly Dauid prayeth: Deliuer my
soule &amp; saue me. In this praier no dout, Dauid
desired to bee deliuered from the verie corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
death at that time, &amp; his soule to be saued
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those present plagues &amp; grieuous torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
that he susteined. In which it might appeare to
some, that he was more addict to this present
life, &amp; that he loued more the quietnes of the
flesh then it became a spiritual man to do.<note place="margin">The most spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man desireth rest.</note> But
as before is said, God hath naturally ingraffed

do desire life, or to haue rest in earth, is for the
maintenance of Gods glory, &amp; that other may
see that God taketh a care ouer his elected. But
now to the grounds &amp; foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Dauids
praiers, &amp; wherupon his praiers do stand. The

Gods infinit goodnes is the fountaine of al

causes by operation of the holy Ghost, helping
our weaknes, to beleeue &amp; to trust that God,

Hast thou no pitie, O Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>? Doest thou not

greeuous torment? wherein is not onely my
tender flesh, but also my verie bones (the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
parte of my bodie) so vexed, that neither
is there beautie nor strength left vnto mee. If
thy anguishes occupied the bodie onely, yet
were the paine almost intollerable: but O
Lord, so horriblie is my soule tormented, that
albeit it be immortal, yet it so quaketh and tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
as verie death should deuour it. And
thus doe I sustaine most grieuous tormentes,
both in bodie &amp; soule, of so long continuance,
that it appeareth vnto me, thou hast forgotten
to be merciful. O Lorde, howe long wilt thou
intreate me in this maner? Hast thou forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thy louing mercies? Or hast thou lost thy
fatherly pitie? I haue no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger strength to cry:
yea, and for sobbes and grones I am so weery,
that my breath faileth me: the teares of mine

                  </gap> herewith nightly I haue wette my bed,
haue borne witnesse of my vnfained dolour:
but nowe my eyes are waxen dimme, and my
whole strength is dried vp. In al these lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
complaintes, Dauid speaketh vnto God,
as he would speake vnto a man that were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
what an other man suffered, whereof
it may bee vnderstood, howe the most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and the most spiritual man iudgeth of
<pb facs="tcp:22752:33"/>
God in the time of troble: assuredly he thoght
that God taketh no care for him, and therfore
doeth hee, as it were, accuse God of vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
&amp; that he loketh not vpon him with
the eyes of his accustomed mercie, as clearely
by these worodes may be espied. And yet are
Dauids troubles the first ground &amp; cause why
he maketh his praiers &amp; claimeth to be heard,
not that troubles (as before is noted) are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
by them selues for Gods deliueraunce,
but in recounting his dolour, Dauid hath a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
accesse to Gods mercie, which chalengeth
&amp; clameth of dutie to appertein to al his, who
in the time of trouble cal for his support, help,
&amp; aide.<note place="margin">Mercie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to al the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures of God that cal for the same vnfainedly. Iob. 9.</note> And it is the same ground that Iob ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
where he saith: is it profitable vnto thee,
that thou violently oppresse me? wilt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the worke of thine own hands? thou hast
formed &amp; made me altogether: and wilt thou
now deuour me? Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I beseech thee, that
thou hast fashioned me as a moulde, and that
thou shalt bring me to dust: thou hast couered
me with skin &amp; flesh, with sinowes &amp; bones
hast thou ioyned me, with life &amp; ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes hast
thou beautified me, &amp; thy prudence hath kept
my spirit. Here may be espied vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
these two stood in this most grieuous paynes.
<pb facs="tcp:22752:33"/>
Their trouble mooued them to complain, and
to appeale to the great mercie of God, which
as they alledge, euen so is it most sure, he may
deny to none that aske it: for as the troubles
of his creatures is none aduantage vnto God,
so to denie mercie when it is asked, were to
deny himself, &amp; herein, dearely beloued, I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish you to reioyce. For I can be witnesse
howe constantly yee haue called for grace in
your anguishes, and your owne conscience
must testifie, that ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ye haue found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
and comfort in suche measure, that you
haue bin bold to triumph against your aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
in Christ Iesus our sauior. Be nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
albeit presently ye feele not your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
consolation: that shal hurt you no more
then the trobles of Dauid &amp; Iob did hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who in the time that they spake these former
words, found no more consolation then you
do now in the most extremitie of your troble.
Neither yet did they hastily obtain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort: for
Dauid saith, O Lord, howe long wilt thou so
cruelly punish me? And yet we know most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
that they were heard, &amp; that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their own harts desire, as no dout euery
man shal, that in time of troble (be it spiritual
or corporal) appeareth only to Gods mercie.
<pb facs="tcp:22752:34"/>
The second ground and foundation wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the prayers of Dauid doe stande, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
goodnesse of God, for thus hee saieth:
Saue me O God, for thy goodnesse. Dauid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had asked mercie, and declared his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes,
but now searching &amp; reasoning with
him selfe secretly in his conscience, after this
maner: Why should God shewe mercie vnto
him, that so hainously had offended, and that
iustly was tormented by Gods hande, for his
transgression &amp; sin? No other grounde that is
alwayes sure &amp; permanent findeth he: except
Gods infinite goodnesse, which he espieth to
bee onely the staie, which neither tempest of
windes,<note place="margin">The eye of faith.</note> neither floodes of water are able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow,
nor vndermind. And, oh how pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
are the eyes of Faith, that in so deepe a
dungeon of desperation, can yet espie in the
midst of those troublesome darknesse, goodnes
to remaine in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and such goodnesse as
is sufficient and able to ouercome, deuour and
swalow vp al the iniquities of his elect, so that
none of them are able to gainstande or hinder
Gods infinite goodnesse, to shewe his mercie
to his troubled childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hereby are we taught,
beloued mother, in the extremitie of our tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
to run to Gods only goodnesse, there to
<pb facs="tcp:22752:34"/>
seeke comfort by Iesus Christ, and no where
els. I feare nothing the blasphemous voices of
such, nor their raging against God and against
his onely eternal veritie, that are not ashamed
to affirme that this kinde of doctrine maketh
men negligent to doe good workes, against
whom no otherwise wil I contend, then doth
the Apostle, saying: their damnation is iust.
For my purpose and minde is, to edifie those
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath called from darknesse to light,
whose eyes it hath pleased his mercie so to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly they feele the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

al iustice, and al vertue proceeding from
vs, is so contaminate and defiled, that the very
workes which wee doe, must be purged by an
other, and that therefore can none of them be
infallible groundes of our praier, neither
yet a sufficient cause why we should be heard.
But the goodnesse of God, as it is infinite, so
can it not bee defiled by our iniquitie: but
it pearceth through the same, and wil shewe
it selfe to our consolation, euen as the
beames of the bright Sun, pearce through the
mystie and thicke cloudes, and bring downe
<pb facs="tcp:22752:35"/>
his natural heate, to comforte and quicken
suche hearbes and creatures, as through vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of colde were almost falne into deadly
decaie. And thus the onely goodnesse of God
remaineth in al stormes, the sure foundation
to the afflicted. Against which the Deuil is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
able to preuaile. The knowledge of this
is so necessarie to the afflicted conscience, that
without the same, it is verie harde to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
the assaultes of the aduersarie: for as
he is a spirite most suttle and vigilant, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the children of God, so is it easie to him to

causes that be within man, &amp; especially when
wee are in trouble: yea, he can persuade that
we lacke those thinges, which most assuredly
we haue by Gods free gift and grace. As for
example: if wee desire to bee deliuered from
trouble and anguishe of conscience with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
and Iob, sodeinely can the Deuil obiect,
what appertaineth their example vnto thee,
they had many notable and singular vertues,
which thou lackest: if wee desire remission
of sinnes with Magdalen, with Peter, or

til by operation of the holie Ghost wee are
ranished and refte vp to the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our GOD, so that our mindes are
fixed onely vppon Gods infinite goodnesse,
clayming by the same to receiue mercie, as
Iob doeth in his former woordes, the sense
and meaning whereof, is this: O Lord thou

thine infinite goodnesse, which begunnest to

is there any creature cleane and perfect in such
perfection, that without mercie he may abide
the trial of thy iustice? or is there any iniquitie
now in me, which thy wisedom did not know
before? And thus I appeale to thy mercy which
springeth from thy infinite goodnes. O deere

you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Dauid and Iob, yee haue hearde, and
Esay making his heauie complainte for the
plagues of the people of Israel openly confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that al had sinned, that their right eousnes
was nothing but filthinesse, that none sought
God, that none called vpon his name. And
Daniel in his prayer like wise confesseth, that al
had wrought wickedly, that al had declined
from God, yea and that none had submitted
them selues to GOD, nor yet had made
supplication vnto him, albeit hee had punished
their former inobedience: and therefore saith
hee, that they did not alledge their owne iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in their prayers. Consider, deare Mother,
that no mention is made of any righteousness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that was within them selues, neither yet doe
they glory of any workes or vertues, that they
had wrought before, for they vnderstood that
God was authour of all goodnesse. And
therefore to him only apperteineth the praise.
But as for their sinnes, they vnderstood them
<pb facs="tcp:22752:37"/>
to bee the infirmities of their owne fleshe,
and therfore boldly called they for mercy. And
that by Gods infinite goodnesse, which is no
lesse free vnto you, then vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to
the riches of his liberal graces, which plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he powreth foorth vpon al them that cal on
the name of the Lord Iesus. The third and last
grounde of Dauids praiers, was the glory and
and praise of Gods name to be shewed and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in his life, as in these wordes hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
               <q>For there is no remembrance of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in death: who landeth thee in the
pitte?</q>
               <p>As Dauid woulde say: O Lorde, howe
shal I pray and declare thy goodnesse, when
I am dead and gone downe in to the graue? I
is not thy ordinary course, to haue thy myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and wonderous works preached vnto men
by those, that are buried, and gone downe into
the pit: those that are dead make no mention
of thee in the earth. And therefore, O Lorde,
spare thy seruant, that yee for a time I may
shewe and witnesse thy wonderous woorkes
vnto mankinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22752:38"/>These most godly affections in Dauid did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
in him a vehement horror and feare of
death, besides that which is natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to al men, bicause he perfectly vnderstood
that by death hee shoulde be letted any further
to aduance the glory of God. Of this same he
complaineth most vehemently in the 88. Psalm,
where apparauntly hee taketh from the dead,
sense, remembrance, feeling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
aledging that God worketh no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
by the dead, that the goodnes of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be preached in the graue, nor his faith by
perdition, and that his meruellous workes, are
not knowne in darkenesse. By which speache
we may not vnderstand, that Dauid taketh all
sense and feeling from the dead, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>either yet
that they which are dead in Christ, are in such
estate, that by God they haue not consolation
and life: no, Christ him selfe doth witnesse the
contrary: but Dauid so vehemently expresseth
their estate and condition, because that after
death they are depriued from al ordinatie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
in the Church of God. None of
those that are departed are appointed to bee
preachers of Gods glory vnto mankinde. But
after death they ceasse any more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o aduannce
Gods holy name, heere amongest the liuing
<pb facs="tcp:22752:38"/>
on earth, and so shall euen they in that behalfe
be vnprofitable to the congregation, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
any thing that they can do, either in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or soule after death. And therefore most
earnestly Dauid desired to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liue in Israel, for the
further manifestation of Gods glory. Heere is
to bee obserued a short, but yet a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
note, which is this, what the thinges bee
which wee ought principally to seeke in this
transitorie life: Not those for the which
the blinde world contendeth and striueth, but
God and his louing kindnes to ward mankind,
his amiable promises, and true religion to be
aduanced and preached vnto others our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that be ignorant. For if we doe not, we
may rather bee counted beastes then men,
dead stocks, not liuing creatures, yea rather
thinges that bee not at al, then substance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
either being, or life. Seeing that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
declare the glory of God, the earth with
the whole contentes thereof, what euer they
bee, doe geue praise to his holy name, the Sea,
floods and fountaines, with the wonders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the same, do not ceasse to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the wisedome, the power, and the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their creator, what then shalbe saide
of man, that neither seeketh, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
<pb facs="tcp:22752:39"/>
Gods glory? Yea what shal bee
iudged of those, that not onely hinder Gods
glory, but also declare them selues enimies to
such, as woulde promote it? I must speake my
conscience with a sorowful heart, they are not
onely dead, but they are also of the nature of
him by whose malice and enuie, death entred
into the worlde, that is, of the Diuel. But them
I omit at this present because their accusation
doeth not muche apperteine to this our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whereof nowe I must make an ende,
somewhat contrary to my minde. For so I am
compelled by some present troubles as wel of
body, as of Spirite. The fourth part of this
Psalm I omit til more opportunitie: for it doth
not much appertaine to the spiritual crosse, but
it is as it were a Prophesie spoken against all
such, as reioyce at the troubles of Gods elect,
who assuredly shalbe confounded and soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought to shame, when the Lord shal heare
the voices of the sore afflicted.</p>
               <p>Now, dearely beloued in our Sauiour
Christe Iesus, seeing that the spiritual crosse is
proper to the children of God, seeing that it is
geuen to vs as a most effectual medicine, aswel
to remome diseases, as to plant in our soules
<pb facs="tcp:22752:39"/>
most notable vertues, such as is humilitie, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
contempt of our selues, and continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of our owne weakenesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.
And seeing that you haue had most
euident signes, that this same medicine hath
wrought in you a part of al the promises, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it thankfully of your fathers hand, what
trouble soeuer it bring with it: and albeit that
the fleshe grudge, yet let the spirite reioyce,
stedfastly looking for deliuerance, &amp; assuredly
yee shall obteine according to the goodwil &amp;
promise of him who cannot deceiue, to whom
bee glory for euer and euer before his congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
Amen.</p>
               <p>Now seeing it is vncertaine, beloued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if euer we shal meete in this corporal life:
which wordes I wil not that yee take in any

chaunced to them before and after the same.
Before Christes passion as they were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by Christes owne mouth of many things,
appertaining to that kingdome of God, which
they neither perfectly vnderstoode, neither

shoulde bee ashamed, slandered and offended

finally that persecution and trouble from time
to time should apprehende them. With these
most dolorous tydinges, hee also promised,
that hee shoulde rise vppon the thirde day,
<pb facs="tcp:22752:45"/>

for trouble before it came? Or did they looke
for any comforte, when the forespoken
trouble was come? It is most euident that no
such thing did enter into their heartes. For
before Christes death their greatest minde
was vppon worldly honour, for which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

            <p>Now if the lawe, which by reason of our

               </gap>he
more comfortable and puisant is it to suche as

<pb facs="tcp:22752:52"/>
ignorant, that as the Israelites lothed the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
because that euerie day they saw and eate
but one thing, so some there bee nowe adayes
(who wil not be holden of the worst sort) that
after once reading some parcelles of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
doe commit them selues altogether to
prophane authours, and humane lectures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the varietie of matters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined,
doeth bring with it dayly delectation:
where contrariwise, within the simple scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es
of God, the perpetual repetition of one

               </gap>confesse, may enter into Gods very elect
for a time, but impossible it is, that therin they
continue to the end: for Gods election besides
other ouident signes hath this euer ioyned
with it, that Gods elect are called from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(I speake of those that are come to the
yeares of knowledge) to some tast and feeling
of Gods mercie, of the which they are neuer
so satisfied in this life, but from time to time
they hunger and they thirst, to ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the bread
that descended from heauen, and to drink the
water that springeth to life euerlasting: which
they cannot doe but by the meanes of Fayth,
and Fayth looketh euer to the wil of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
by the worde, so that Fayth hath both
her beginning and continuance by the worde
<pb facs="tcp:22752:53"/>
of God. And so I say, that impossible it is that
Gods chosen children can despise or reiect the
worde of their saluation of any long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
neither yet loath it to the ende. Often it
is, that Gods elect are holden in such bondage
and thraldom, that they cannot haue the bread
of life broken vnto them, neither yet free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to exercise them selues in Gods holie
word: but then doe not Gods children loath,
but most gladly doe they couet the foode of
their soules: Then do they accuse their former
negligence, then lament they the miserable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of their brethren, and then crye &amp; cal
they in their heartes (and openly where they
dare) for free passage of the Gospel. This hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst doeth prooue the life of their
soules. But of suche men, as hauing libertie to
reade, and exercise them selues in Gods holie
scriptures, &amp; yet begin to be wery, because fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
time to time they reade but one thing: I aske,
why are not they weary, euerie day to eate
bread, to drink wine, to behold the brightnesse
of the Sun, &amp; to vse the rest of gods creatures,
which euery day do keepe their own substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
course and nature? They shal answere (I trust)
Because such creatures haue a strength to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the life. O miserable creatures, who dare
attribute more power &amp; strength to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
creatures in nourishing &amp; preseruing
<pb facs="tcp:22752:53"/>
the mortal carkas, then to the eternal woorde
of God in the nourishment of the soule, which
is immortal! To reason with their damnable
vnthankfulnesse at this present, is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
But to you, my deare brethren, I wryte
my knowledge, and do speake my conscience,
That so necessarie, as the vse of meate &amp; drink
is to the preseruation of corporal life, and so
neces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arie as the heate and brightnesse of the
Sunne is to the quickening of the hearbes, and
to expel darknesse: So necessarie is also to the
life euerlasting, and to the illumination and
light of the soule, the perpetual meditation,
exercise &amp; vse of Gods holie word. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
deere brethren, if that yee looke for a life
to come, of necessitie it is, that yee exercise
your selues in the booke of the Lorde your
God. Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o day slip or want some comfort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from the mouth of God: open your
eares, and he wil speake euen pleasant thinges
to your heart: close not your eyes, but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
let them beholde, what portion of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is left to you within your fathers Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
Let your tongues learne to praise the
gracious goodnesse of him, whose meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
hath called you from darkenesse to light,
and from death to life. Neither yet may ye do
this so quietly, that ye wil admit no witnesse:
<pb facs="tcp:22752:54"/>
no brethren, yee are ordained of God to rule
your owne houses in his true feate, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his word. Within your houses, I say,
in some cases ye are Bishops and Kinges: your
wife, children, seruantes, and family, are your
Bishopprike and charge: of your it shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
howe carefully and diligently ye haue
alwayes instructed them in Gods knowledge,
how that ye haue studied in them to plant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and suppresse vice. And therefore I say, ye
must make them partakers, in reading, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and in making common praiers, which I
woulde in euerie house were vsed once a day
at least: but aboue al thinges, deare brethren,
studie to practise in life, that which the worde
of God commandeth, and then be yee assured,
that yee shal neuer heare nor reade the same
without fruite. And thus much for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
within your houses. Considering that S.
Paule calleth the congregation, the bodie of
Christ, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof euerie one of vs is a member,
teaching vs therby, that no member is of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,
to susteine and feede it selfe, without
the helpe and support of an other: I thinke it
necessarie, for the conference of scriptures, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of brethren be had. The order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be obserued, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xpressed by S. Paule, and
therefore neede not I to vse many woordes in
<pb facs="tcp:22752:54"/>
that behalfe: only willing that when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
are come together, which I woulde were
once a weeke, that your beginning shoulde be
from confession of your offences, and inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the spirite of the Lorde Iesus Christ to
assist you, in al your godly enterprises. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
let some place of scripture bee plainely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
redde, so much as shal be thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for one day or time: which ended, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
brother haue exhortation, questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or dout,
let him not feare to speake or moue the same,
so that he doe it with moderation, either to
edifie, or to be edified. And hereof I dout not,
but great profite shal shortly ensue: For first by
hearing, reading, and conferring the scriptures
in the assemblie, the whole bodie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God shal become familiar: The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and spirites of men shalbee tried. Their
patience and modestie shalbee knowne, and
finally their giftes and vtterance shal appeare.
Multiplication of wordes, prolixe interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and wilfulnesse in reasoning, is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided
at al times, and in al places, but chiefly
in the congregation: where nothing ought to
be respected, except the glorie of God, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
or edification of brethren. If any thing
occurre within the text, or els arise in reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which your iudgements can not resolue,
<pb facs="tcp:22752:55"/>
or capacities comprehend: let the same be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and put in writing before yee dismisse the
congregation, that when God shal offer vnto
you any interpretor, your dout beeing noted
and knowne, may haue the more expedite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
or els that when ye shal haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to write to such, as with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye wold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
your iudgementes, your letters may
signifie and declare the vnceasing desire that
ye haue of God, and of his true religion. And
they I dout not, according to their talents, wil
endeuour and bestow their faithful labours to
satisfie your godly petitions. Of my selfe, I wil
speake as I thinke, I wil more gladly spend ten
houres in communicating my iudgement with
you in explayning, as God pleaseth to open to
me, any place of scripture, then halfe an houre
in any matter beside. Further, I would in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the scriptures ye should ioine some bokes
of the olde, and some of the newe Testament
together, as Genesis and one of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes,
Exodus with an other, &amp; so forth, euer
ending suche bookes as yee begin, as the time
wil suffer. For it shal greatly comforte you, to
heare that harmonie &amp; wel tuned song, of the
holie spirite, speaking in our fathers, from the
beginning. It shal confirme you in these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and perillous dayes, to behold the face
<pb facs="tcp:22752:55"/>
of Christ Iesus his louing spouse and Church,
from Abel to him selfe, and from him selfe to
this day, in al ages to be one. Be frequent in the
Prophets, and in the Epistles of S. Paul: for the
multitude of matters most comfortably therin
contained, requireth exercise &amp; good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Like as your assemblies ought to beginne
with confession &amp; in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocation of God his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
spirite: So woulde I that they were finished
with thanksgiuing, &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiers for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Rulers &amp; Magistrates, for the libertie and
free passage of Christ his Euangelie, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and deliuerance of our afflicted brethren,
in al places now persecuted, but most cruelly
within the realmes of Fraunce and Englande:
and for such other thinges, as the spirit of the
Lord Iesus shal teach vnto you to bee profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
either to your selues or to your brethren,
whersoeuer they be. If thus (or better) I shal
heare that yee exercise your selues, deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
then wil I praise God for your great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as for them, that not onely haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the word of grace with gladnesse, but
that also with care and diligence do keepe the
same, as a treasure and iewel most precious.
And because I can not suspect that ye wil doe
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie at this present, I wil vse no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings:
for my good hope is, that ye shal walk,
