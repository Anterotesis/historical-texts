         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are few resolutions that are filled with more hazard, then those which are vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to giue satisfaction to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered humors; wherein whilest euerie man would seeme eyther not to erre at all, or to haue some colourable excuse for that which they had rather call freedom of conscience and Christian libertie then tearme errour, the state of the Church hangeth ballanced with some oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site contrarieties, as if it were the most profitable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to stand in consultation, and not to aduenture to hold any thing. Doubtlesse no cause hath gained lesse to the defendants then this of the Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for first being in it selfe barren, it hath little wherein there can be vse of the ancient Fathers: for whilest men out of their owne fancie will frame dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, wee can but in the generall alleage the constant moderation of our forefathers, and without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for particulers, satisfie them so farre as Religion and reason will giue leaue: Secondly, all men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a pittie naturally toward such whom they suppose to suffer for the testimonie of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whilest others are suspected to flatter the present state; as if nothing could be reputed honest, which were not a bold opposition (vnder colour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciene)
<pb facs="tcp:9352:5"/>
to a setled gouernment, vnto these may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which is not the least euill, that whilest impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience &amp; zeale openeth the mouthes of our enemies for any fault in our answering committed by vs; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy doth open the mouthes of our supposed friends, for that which may be thought to be done well. So that though the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence hath nothing in it to be desired, this only remaineth as the comfort against all trobles, that it is a right vse of our small talent dispensed with Humility and dutie for the benefit and peace of the Church of Christ; <hi>where,</hi> first in the daies of our late dread soueraigne of blessed memory some fearing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition might returne (like a troublesome guest, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long nor farr absent) sundry of the most learned &amp; most sincere, not called to the honor &amp; the burden of a Bishopprick were consulted with all, to giue satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to such who seemed rather to follow the example of forraine Churches, then to haue iust reasons to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like their owne.</p>
            <p>To this end letters were sent from the reuerend fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers of the Church, to desire the resolution concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the apparell of ministers, Ceremonies, and other indifferent things to <hi>M. Bullinger, F. Martyr, Gualter, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> &amp; others, men without comparison for integrity &amp; learning equall to the best in those times, &amp; not much exceeded by any, to my knowledge that haue liued since; their answers to these questions for the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our brethren (if they loue peace) we thought to haue published in the end of this treatise.<note place="margin">By Master Cartwright Martin. &amp;c</note> After these times, by the suggestion of some both from Geneua &amp; Scotland, the Church had not long rest, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers admonitions, were written to the Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring a new discipline, sundry Inuectiues against the
<pb facs="tcp:9352:5"/>
Bishops &amp; diuers vnhallowed pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlets from the brood of <hi>Cham,</hi> who gloried in the discouery of the supposed nakednes of their owne fathers; a little more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rigor (for their malypart boldnes had awaked the accustomed cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of a most gracious prince) by the execution of some few, stopped in a manner for a time the mouthes, &amp; the Pennes of all; letting the ages that come after vnderstand thus much, that writings how learned soeuer (as what could be more excellent for modesty &amp; iudgement,<note place="margin">D. Whitgift.</note> then the pains of that most worthy Archbishop) are able to do litle good for the quiet of the Church, if the magistrates be wanting to giue aid: &amp; that they who at first make holines &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation the scope of whatsoeuer they say or write, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to aime at nothing but to make men better; in the end, by degrees fall to a vanity prophanely to libel to make others laugh, &amp; in my weak opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> few things euer hapned in this kingdom more auailable to breed Atheisme then that was. But the scope being for a Presbyteriall discipline it found with the most of that faction this fauour to be reprooued no more sharpely then the sin of the sons of <hi>Hely</hi>: hitherto all stroue for a Presbitery, wherof at the first comming of our most gracious soueraigne to this kingdom many were filled with a vain hope, doubtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> deceiued by such men, who either vnderstood not the state of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth or had little care of the happy prosperity of this Church.</p>
            <p>But in the end, when authority was more blessed, &amp; assisted from aboue, then to be deluded with such mists or to giue any hope to couetous affections gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily longing for the fall of Bishops (which one Act of preseruing their state and honour) amongst many thousand arguments of fauour shewed towards them shall stirre vp the praiers of all that now liue for

the continuance of his state, and make his memorie blessed amongst all posterities to the worlds end; then I say many began to make a rent in the Church, and to breake from vs (chusing rather (with what consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they know) to forsake their function and calling, then to yeeld their conformitie to the cerimonies of this Church; which hitherto by themselues were euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eputed as things indifferent; and doubtlesse neither so many nor so dangerous, but in this time of light and knowledge they may be admitted without supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all: forseeing (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> saith) we be so free as we haue but a few Ceremonies, and those easie and gentle, it would be an intollerable thing, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be condemned,<note place="margin">P Martyr. 20 C. Coun. part. 4. cap 11. sect. 9</note> if we should not performe them without corruption. I wish those to consider well, who are desirous to make these things simply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, both how they differ from themselues and others at other times, and what bondage (vnder the name of libertie) they impose vpon the Church by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying her authoritie to ordaine ceremonies; in which if little or nothing be left vnto her, neither shall she need much the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods spirit to guid her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, nor challenge any great obedience in her owne name, if all things that are, be simply either good or euill: to which errour if Zeale or opinion shall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any, he must eyther make the worship of God to be without Ceremonies, or those Ceremonies simply necessarie, without which there is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe; none that I know would haue religion to want all Ceremonies, sauing onely those who would haue all men to want Religion: some there are which wish that these ceremonies were simple, chast, and few, that is not significant at all: It were doubtlesse a
<pb facs="tcp:9352:6"/>
great folly (if not an idlenes in God seruice) eyther to admit or retaine those ceremonies, which they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed should signifie nothing; but moderate minds do think otherwise, that neither ceremonies nor their sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, are to be misliked as vnlawfull, whilest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is signified, but that which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues wil account lawfull. So then, neither depriuing the Church of the vse of ceremonies in diuine worship, nor making these of that vnchangeable nature as simply eyther her good or euill, but onely as things of themselues indifferent, (for better place and respect they neuer retained in our Church) we will briefely set downe for the satisfying of some men; that indifferent things by Ciuill or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall constitution do change their nature, and by vertue of commaundement become necessarie; so that eyther they must be not indifferent, but simply vnlawfull; or being indifferent, such as by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement are made necessarie. To denie that there are things indifferent, is to take Christian libertie from men: and to denie the ceremonies in their owne nature to be such, is to take al liberty from the Church for without these what is there wherein the Church is not expresly and necessarily directed by the word of God? we are taught that all things which happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the compasse of human action are of three sorts; eyther good, or euill, or indifferent: of the first and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde are all things commaunded or forbidden in the law of God, (except the ceremonie of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) commaunded to the Iewes but not to vs: Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things are of that nature, that by themselues, and properly they are neither good nor euill, but in respect of some other thing,<note place="margin">

But when experience had taught, that such liberty became dangerous to the Church &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwelth, being turned ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times into a lice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which mischiefe necessitie hath onely found out this remedy, to moderate this liberty that it neither erre on the right hand nor the left, that it ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come short nor go beyond a meane; therfore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith all things are lawful for me, but al things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit not, all things are lawful, but al things are not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherin he toucheth the extemities at both hands. Now then the means to keep our liberty, that it neither
<pb facs="tcp:9352:7"/>
be too much, nor too little are of two sorts: general, &amp; speciall: the general is charity the principal direction of mans life. For whatsoeuer we desire to do or omit (being in it selfe indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) charity must consider how farre to proceed without offence: for why should our liberty (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned of another mans con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science? &amp; therfore in this case we are rather to depart from that liberty we haue, then to be offensiue to those who are more weak, &amp; so giue occasion for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speak euil of vs, &amp; of that which was left free: for charity wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs in these things to respect others more then our selues, &amp; rather to omit that which is lawful for vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do that which is hurtfull for them: the other rule to limit indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things is speciall: which is not so distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht from the other, as if it were without charity, but that charity which ought to be in all, is here directed in a speciall maner: for howsoeuer charity so extendeth it selfe that it may serue to all parts of our life, as though we need not to be directed by any other law, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause al men are not so wel sighted perfectly to discern what is expedient at all times, &amp; for that the offices of charity are somtimes changed, (for times &amp; occasions may fal out, that things iust &amp; to be done, may be clean contrary) therfore there is required an experienced and mature iudgment to determine what is fit, least whilst we labour to profit we iniury the Church &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in which are contained the charities of all. God therefore respecting mans weaknes hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed magistrates &amp; Gouernours in both, to serue as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies to guide &amp; direct what is fit to be done, &amp; to this end to make lawes concerning indifferent things, that so the whole body may be gouerned with <hi>comelines, order,</hi> and <hi>edification.</hi> This no man can denie, but such as desire to be exempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ministers to whom we must be subiect, not for feare but for conscience; obeying also our spirituall rulers, for they watch ouer vs to giue account vnto God for our soules.<note place="margin">Rom. 13 Heb. 13</note> And therefore no man can denie, but that in things of this nature, all men are to be gouerned by their lawes; which whilest they are in force, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or forbidding binde the conscience as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue doth. Herein if any would seeme to see more then those that doe make lawes (a thing not likely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most, and the wisest, and the best experienced are assembled to that end) we cannot think it warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to be so presumptuous, nor expedient to dispute (but in place of counsell) of the equitie of lawes when they are once established: this moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if all men had obserued, doubtlesse long since this Church had beene blessed with a happie peace. But if any man be perswaded that the ceremonies inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are not of this nature, it is but an opinion lately sprung vp, whereunto the necessitie of obedience in indifferent things hath compelled them to flie, and it satisfieth vs (though it cannot then) that with all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and the Church we do thinke otherwise: God grant vs all in due time truly to thinke and to speake the same things.

In the first, wee take those things to bee good and true, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, directly are euill and false, (an error peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may appeare hereafter to haue misled you in this point:) so those that put the Apostles to death, did thinke in that action, that they pleased God: for the time was come that our Sauiour foretold; <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer killeth you,</hi>

                  <hi>will thinke that hee doth God seruice.</hi> In the second, a false application arising out of a true ground: because hee heareth that God is to bee loued aboue all things, therefore he thinketh it vnlawfull to loue any thing but God: these erre not alike, but the error of Conscience doth infect both. Neither ought a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that thus erreth, to bynd, seeing the force and strength of Conscience is not built vpon himselfe, but vpon <hi>some Precept, (seeming so to it selfe)</hi> bring no good reason, but either because it is <hi>commaunded,</hi> or else <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</hi> Against which, contrarily either to doe or to maintaine, is to foyle (as you say) the Conscience, and to make it like a distempered lock, that no key will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. But, let vs heare your selfe lay downe the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, whereat your Conscience doth either truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, or in weakenesse stumble.</p>

               <p>A Weeke after I was called before the Bishop of London, the Deane of the Chappell being with him, and (after many sharpe rebukes for my Sermon preached before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie) vrged to subscribe to the three articles; we stood a time in clearing some exceptions then taken: at last, I prayed leaue to write downe the same limitation which I had written to his Maiestie, and then read before them. Which being denyed as idle and needlesse to be exprest, because it was alwaies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and vnderstood, I (taking them both and God to witnes that I did subscribe in the same sence, and with the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations that I had expressed in that sent vnto his Maiesty) did then subscribe. This done, I pretested vnto them that I had in the some manner, and with the same protestation sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed twise before, yet wished that my present subscription might not be diuulged, but as I my selfe should open it, least I should be thoght to haue done that at this time out of feare, &amp; for desire of inlargment (which God knew, I had done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my iudgement) &amp; so become lesse profitable in my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp; lesse able to satisfie other men. The bishop replied that the King must know it, otherwise for his part it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9352:27"/>
which the Deane also promised as well as he, I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I knew well his Maiestie must know it, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not who knew it but in the former respect, and that my selfe would make it knowne, (which thing I did the same houre and neuer yet denyed) beseeching them to informe his Maiestie that I had done no more now then before, least his Maiesty should thinke me caried by feare as a man of an euill conscience, which they both promised to doe: his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Master Deane then exhorted me to conformitie in practise, I answered, that for my iudgement of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they knew it (as did also many of the ministers) amongest whom I had at sundry conferences discouered and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my opinion of their lawfulnes: but for practise, I should yeilde to haue them vsed in my cure, but in my owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who had neuer vsed them, and once lost my place for not vsing them, I durst not promise it (at least) vntill I had done what I could to preuent offence. Two daies after this, I was called againe before the Bishop to be discharged of mine imprisonment by order from his Maiesties Counsell. At what time the Bishop exhorted me to conforme my selfe, and perswade other men, for conformitie I besought his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not to expect it at my hands, nor to say, I doubled with him, if I performed it not so long as the feare of scandall should restraine me, adding that his Lordship might gaine much honour to himselfe, and peace to the Church by shewing compassion vpon the ministers in a few lighter things, when their hearts were so inclinde to peace, his Lordship replied that I should haue time to teach and satisfie my people, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that I did not so much feare the offence of those, with whom I now liue, as of other places where I had liued. And as touching the satisfying of other men I tolde him, I might not vndertake to perswade, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9352:28"/>
would be readie vpon any occasion to professe freely what I thought, as I had done alreadie at sundrie conferences, and that I had that day receiued some obiections of a friend in writing, to which I had promised Answer. His Lordship wished to see the arguments, but I craued pardon, bycause they were committed to me from a friend, and vpon trust, he then required to see mine answer before I should send it to my friend, which I yeilded vnto, and haue not yet bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for I neuer sent answer to it, nor euer shall. And this my Lord to my best remembrance is the whole summe of that which I haue done, and the world speaketh of so much, and diuersly out of all which this summe ariseth: First, that I haue foure times subscribed to the Booke of common prayer with limitation and reference of all things therein contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vnto the purpose and doctrine of this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and limitation I eyther wrote down or protested before witnesse: Secondly, that I neuer promised present confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in practise, howsoeuer I confessed the ceremonies not simply vnlawfull, as I did since also before your Lordship.</p>

times subscribed to the booke of common praier with limitation and reference of all things therein contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the purpose and doctrine of this Church of England. Secondly, that you neuer promised confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in practise, howsoeuer you confessed the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not simply vnlawfull; be the principall things contayned in it; yet, because some other things are pertinent to this cause, wee will rather examine then answer what you haue alleadged.</p>
               <p n="1">1 You haue yeilded to subscribe with limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which limitation is the purpose and intention of the Church of England, a caueat (doubtlesse) not needful to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, seeing it is the same Church that requireth subscription, who would not haue any within her own bosom require an allowance to the fancies &amp; opinions that others hould. And peraduenture wise men will thinke that the distinctions found out, are but euasions do what they would not seeme, whilst in the meane time they might lurke vnder some equiuocall cloud as the Iesuits doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Further, you desire that your present subscription might not bee diuulged, but as your selfe might open it, a thing you see both yeilded vnto, and performed by those, in whose power it was but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what intention you had, in concealing of it; I can easily afford you so much charity as to thinke it was, least some sinister and false collections might be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from it, whilest some others (peraduenture) more probably think, that you meant to beare your brethren in hand, that you yeilded not so farre as in truth ye did.

can it be reasonably thought, because vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine solemne occasions some Lessons are chosen out of those bookes, and of Scripture it selfe, some Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not appointed to be read at all, that we therby do offer disgrace to the word of God, or lift vp the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men aboue it. For in such choise (considering the intent of the Church) we do not thinke but that <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of speech</hi> may be more respected <hi>then worthines.</hi> And therfore although for the peoples more plain instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the ancient vse hath bin) we read in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches some <hi>Apocripha,</hi> besides the Scripture, yet as the scripture we read them not, all men know the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that the Church of England maketh in this point. But men shall easily fall into error when they once oppose their priuate iudgement against the Reuerend autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their owne Church, neither is their conclusion altogether sound, that seeing <hi>Moses</hi> amongst the Iewes was read euery Sabbath day in their Synagogues, that therefore such Scripture should be onely read, which had the same authority that the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> had, vnlesse they be able to proue that it was not lawfull for any bookes to be read of them, but the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> which if it were true (as all men know it is not) then eyther there was no Scripture, but the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> or elfe all partes of the Scripture was not read in the Iewish Synagogues. If they vrge vs further with the councell of Laodicea, which forbiddeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to be read, that is not Canonicall, we must tell them that the same councell accounteth that Canonicall which is not. Further, we must craue leaue of those who vrge so strictly the reading of the whole Scripture in Churches, in what part of

the world; or in what to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was read in the purest times. Besides, if the authority of Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> (which you vrge against vs) may be accepted as sufficient in this case against you, he will tel you that some part of the beginning of Genesis,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In praefat. in Ezech.</hi>
                  </note> the Canticles, the beginning of Ezechiel were not amongst the Iewes permitted to be read of any, vnlesse they were comne to the age of priesthood, which was thirtye, from whence (paraduenture) the gouernors of our Church haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned their voyces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speaking (by bare reading) to the comon people, who either vnderstand them not at all (being so read) or else peruert them to their owne harme, this is not to sylence them (as you say) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reserue them to a better and safer vse, that those (who for soundnes of Iudgment &amp; knowledge are able) maye reade and expound them at seasons, which are more conuenient. This, if it weare not by lawes strictly commaunded to be obserued of all, but should giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (as you seeme to desire) to some able ministers to doe otherwise, Ignorance (which is euer boldest) would take aduantage continually to be reading the obscurest chapters, whereby the church of necessity could not chuse, but receiue greate harme, &amp; therfore the desires of a few (peraduenture) by reason of their sufficiency not hurtfull, ought to be no motiue why lawes should not be made or executed, which preuent that the worst disposed may not haue libertye to doe harme, or the weakest to receiue. The Chronicles (some part) the Canticles, the Apocalipse, the chapters of some Genealogyes (things wherin ignorant men haue beene euer most forward to deale) contain (in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wise men) many things not so requisit for silly

people to know, because they are not bound to giue an account of those things, &amp; their imployment therein, doth not onely distract them, but make them vnable to know such Scriptures as are of more vse, and neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to their owne saluation.<note place="margin">Prou. 20.3</note> I may say as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> doth in another case: It is modest humilitie to abstayne from these, but euerie foole will be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: so that what safely peraduenture might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to able ministers (such as it may be you are) ought not to be a reason, either, why lawes should not be made at all, or why libertie for not vsage should bee granted to those that are able, seeing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth vs, that euerie man will be a Iudge to account himselfe able, and so exemptions (perhaps) reasonable from the strict obseruation of some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons granted to a few, shall become warrants for the intollerable boldnesse of others, and in the end bring a contempt to all vniformitie in order, from whence must needes follow a ruine and desolution to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the whole Church. And surely if men well considered eyther the generall weakenesse of many that take vpon them to expound, or the common ignorance of silly people mixt with a pron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to euill, when such Scripture is read, hee must needes thinke the wisedome of our forefathers in this choyce of Scripture to be great, and esteeme the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the people to be the principall end that was propounded by them, this made the Vniuersitie of Cambridge to giue permission onely to such, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Epistles, as were thought in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie fit to be admitted to the degree of <hi>Bachelers,</hi> because Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that in them are many

things hard to be vnderstood, which they (that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and vnstable) wrest, as they doe all other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnto their owne destruction,<note place="margin">1.

Yet, howsoeuer, they haue wrongfully accused our Church, in this point, we are glad to see them now so earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaters, for reading the Scriptures in the Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heretofore, the most of them haue beene content for a Sermon of small edification, but of great length, to omit the reading of many Chapters, which might haue beene done at that time, so that, in true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the silencing of the Scripture, was rather to be feared at their hands, who desired to haue it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and left free for to read it at all.</p>

Most of them are not yet come so farre, as to deny Baptisme to Infants (an arrour which may follow from their former opinions, if they suffer Scisme to growe in them, and humours to bee rules for conscience but they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to professe, that there is no saith in the childe required to Baptisme, and that to bee borne of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parents, is as much for their admission into the Church, as the profession of the faith, which they make by the mouthes of others.

Now seeing then that Baptisme implyeth as Circumcision a couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his people, it is to be thought that as God in that sacrament bestoweth remission of sins &amp; the holy Ghost, binding himself as it were to bestow all other graces requisite in time to come; so euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant receiuing the same sacrament at the hands of god

tyeth himselfe likewise for euer, to doe and beleeue what the Lord commaundeth. Now, who is there (considering this contract) that can blame either the interrogatories, or the suretyes which vndertake in this stipulation, seeing the thing is required, nay, inioyned with such necessity for the Church, to exclude infants, because they cannot by their owne tongues contract, were ouer rigorous: and not to take securitie at all, for those who cannot answere for themselues were to bee to carelesse; for the profession of faith, beeing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to a publike admittance into the house of God, what cause is there why suretyes may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doe it, seeing they know they are the children of fathfull Parents, and so consequently partakers of the promise, and that they are such as would make the same profession themselues, if they were of yeares, or that the Church should not require it, euen to put men in minde vpon what condition they admit them into the Church, and to manifest a reason, why they refuse others: so that for any thing I see alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, as faith and repentance are necessarie to make the Sacraments effectuall, so this faith in this case is lawfully professed by the sureties, and effectuall for the infant, whome to accept into the Church without this, were to wrong the Sacrament, and not to receiue with this, were to wrong those infants, to whom the couenant belongeth by an euerlasting promise.<note place="margin">Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From hence proceedeth a reuerend vse and estimation of the signe of the crosse, in the Apostles time, signing hereby not onely themselues when they met with the Iewes, but their children which were baptised, to dedicate them by badge, as it were to his seruice, whose benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon them, were contained vnder that name, and procured vnto man by Christs death vpon the crosse.

               <p>Now it is plaine, that sauing the verie point of adoration and worship, with which popery crowned this Idoll, there is nothing ascribed to the crosse, in or out of Baptisme, by the ranckest Papists, but the fathers are as deeply ingaged in the same. So, if we vse it as the fathers, wee hold it to be so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for our defence, as was the bloud of the passouer vpon the Israelites posts, or as the marke on their foreheads in the ninth of <hi>Ezechiell</hi> without which none can be safe. For so did the fathers, and we take the soule to be fenced by the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the body, and the crosse to haue vertue of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or the childe: of driuing away diuels witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and diseases, of strengthing against temptations. And if we will excuse the fathers by saying they spake thus rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè, with reference to the crosse of Christ and his death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will all their speaches heare this releefe, nor haue we at all distanced them from the Papists, who say as much for themselues: and then what Popish superstition is that, from which we haue purged it?

feare it iustly, knowing how vnder the couert of phrases, the maine points of trueth haue beene surprised, and therefore may be againe.

               <p>Now if it may appeare (as doubtlesse it will) that not onely religious things were dedicated, but other things also, and that their dedication was in another kinde, without any worship diuine, but by first vsing; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience wil follow, if in the whole action of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and those prayers that are vsed, the Infant be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, which in the canon is ascribed vnto the crosse, that being the onely externall cerimonie expressing the intention of the whole act? Thus <hi>Dauids</hi> house was dedicated, for which was made the thirtieth Psalme: the walles of a citie. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.27. were dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, which was nothing else, as <hi>P.

This kinde of Dedication was called by the Hebrewes <hi>Canach.</hi> The other which was <hi>Chadash,</hi> was to consecrate things holy to God. Now, which of these you vnderstand to bee done by the crosse in Baptisme, it will not bee greatly material against vs, seeing the verie act of Dedication or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration dependeth not vpon the signe of the crosse, but yet so said, because the crosse is an ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t significant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>THere is no part of this whole Treatise, which so vnwillingly I answere as this last; wherein many things are vttered with so much passion, as eyther our seueritie in replying, must exceed the vsuall modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which wee desire to hold, or else we may iustly be suspected, to betray the cause and the persons whom we should defend. And therefore without any other answere, we will only put you in minde of those harsh speeches, which may peraduenture in this discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be agreeable to your fancie, but are no way su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to your cause, nor verie well beseeming a man of your place. First in these words: <hi>I now beseech your Lordship to remember that the most of vs haue beene peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Israell, and that if some mens rashnes draw reuenge vpon vs,</hi> Aemelius <hi>hath faulted, and</hi> Rutilius <hi>is beaten; one</hi> Mardochey <hi>hath not stouped, and all the Iewes must perish for it.</hi> Can you beleeue that your depriuation is a reuenge which some mens rashnes hath drawn vpon you? Is the proceeding of the reuerend Fathers, for the vnitie of the Church, as if <hi>Aemilius</hi> had faulted, and <hi>Rutilius</hi> should be beaten? or can you in your own conscience compare it with the perishing of the Iewes, for the not stooping of one <hi>Mardochey</hi>? assure your selfe none of them are so transported with ambition, nor so incensed with any particuler contempt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto themselues, which they could not easily haue remitted, if their remissenesse in this had not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded the Churches peace. And therefore doubt not but your selfe and others can well testifie that some of them haue dealt with your selfe, and diuers
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:9352:85"/>
in your case like fathers with their owne children, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing vnattempted to reforme your opinion, before they proceeded to giue sentence. A dutie that lieth vpon their shoulders, with as much indispensable necessitie, as <hi>conformitie</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> vpon ours. Like vnto this surmise, is that which followeth; <hi>And say wee cannot confirme in euerie point, you know who said, the varietie of ceremonies did commend the vnitie of faith</hi>: But doubtlesse it had beene much better for the Church: more warrantable for your selues: more pleasing to the state: more profitable to your owne families: to haue conformed your selues in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie poynt, then by refusing to hinder the Church of that good, which by your owne confession <hi>might haue beene more in one yeare then all the Ceremonies will doe whilest the vvorld standeth.</hi> For if any thing be imposed by authoritie contrarie to the word of God, let some men take vpon them to prooue it; and farre be it from vs for any mans cause to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an euicted errour; wee may bee deceiued, and haue our infirmities as other men, but wee are not vnwilling, who will needes bee our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to account them our maisters, if there bee iust cause.</p>
               <p>But if these ceremonies be onely vnlawfull to some men, for want of true resolution, and so contrarie to conscience (which yet is no warrant for disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) let them learne to know that in things not vnlawfull; It is better to obey, then to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Amongest men of equall authoritie in place of freedome, diuersities of opinions may safely be published without offence, but where men want authority and place to aduise, and when Iawes haue set

               <p>Wherein if both partes remayne equally stiffe in their owne opinions, a mutinie must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for want of Discipline: sometimes I confesse <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie</hi> and <hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>cerimonies</hi> are thought fit; both to shew the authoritie of the Church, (for you selfe haue confessed when you read your articles <hi>that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particuler or nationall Church hath authoritie to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne,</hi>
