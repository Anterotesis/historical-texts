            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEfore I enter upon the matter of the <hi>Subject</hi> I have undertaken, I think my Self obliged to advertiÅ¿e you, That <hi>Gardening</hi> is not among us <hi>Moderns,</hi> what it was in the firÅ¿t <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> In thoÅ¿e early times 'tis probable, they knew no other <hi>Gardens</hi> than thoÅ¿e of <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes,</hi> which we now call <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Gardens;</hi> whereas in our Days, there are Å¿everal other Å¿orts beÅ¿ides them, Å¿ome being for <hi>Parterres</hi> and <hi>Flowers,</hi> Å¿ome for <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> Å¿ome only for plain <hi>Gardens</hi> for <hi>Common UÅ¿e,</hi> and others for <hi>Rare</hi> and <hi>Medicinal Plants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So great a multiplicity of different Å¿orts of <hi>Gardens,</hi> affording no leÅ¿s diverÅ¿ity of employments for <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> in proceÅ¿s of time, introduced Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> of them; Å¿ome being Å¿imply called <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> others taking the quality of <hi>FloriÅ¿ts,</hi> and others well deÅ¿erving the Title of <hi>BotaniÅ¿ts,</hi> and others being named, <note n="*" place="margin">Verbatim. MarÅ¿h Gard'ners.</note> Market Gard'ners, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves only to the raiÅ¿ing and maintaining of <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> for which there wants yet a particular Term, unleÅ¿s we Å¿hould call them <hi>NurÅ¿ery Gard'ners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the explication of the <hi>Original,</hi> and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of which Å¿everal <hi>Ranks</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> I think it will not be impertinent to beÅ¿tow a few Lines, before we paÅ¿s further.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Opinion</hi> in this Matter, is, That the <hi>FirÅ¿t Man</hi> having been Created in a <hi>Garden,</hi> and received Orders after his TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, to till the <hi>Earth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Original of the DiverÅ¿ity of <hi>Gardens. Ex ea vives in laboribus omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus diebus vitae tuae.</hi> GeneÅ¿. cap. v.</note> and to get his Maintenance out of it by the <hi>Sweat</hi> of his <hi>Brows.</hi> It follows from thence, that one of the chiefeÅ¿t Employments, both of <hi>HimÅ¿elf</hi> and his firÅ¿t <hi>DeÅ¿cendants,</hi> was to apply themÅ¿elves to the culture of <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes;</hi> that being then the <hi>Function</hi> which alone Å¿upplyed <hi>Humane Kind,</hi> with all the neceÅ¿Å¿aries of <hi>Life.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Ground</hi> Å¿o tilled, did it not conÅ¿iÅ¿t of true <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Gardens?</hi> And conÅ¿equently, becauÅ¿e in thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t <hi>Ages,</hi> no other <hi>Gardens</hi> were known but Å¿uch, there could be no other <hi>Gard'ners</hi> neither, but thoÅ¿e which govern'd them, who may on that account, be juÅ¿tly eÅ¿teemed the firÅ¿t of the whole <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners.</hi> For the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> properly Å¿peaking, were thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Gard'ners,</hi> and continued to perform that <hi>Function,</hi> till being diverted by their Application to the <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make uÅ¿e of the Service of Å¿ome principal <hi>DomeÅ¿tick</hi> to help them in their <hi>Gardens,</hi> who diÅ¿dained not to take the Name of that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underÅ¿tand by the Term of <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Ages</hi> following, as Å¿oon as Men thought they had made a Å¿ufficient proviÅ¿ion for their NeceÅ¿Å¿ities, and there begun to be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd among them, Å¿ome diÅ¿tinction of Degrees and Fortunes; it hapned that the PleaÅ¿ures of the <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi> inÅ¿pired Å¿ome PerÅ¿ons with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioÅ¿ity to gratifie them with <hi>Flowers</hi> agreeable to one or both of thoÅ¿e <hi>SenÅ¿es,</hi> and accordingly, they begun to gather together Å¿ome of all thoÅ¿e <hi>Beautiful Plants</hi> which they obÅ¿erv'd Å¿o curiouÅ¿ly to enamel, and Å¿o admirably to perfume the Fields, where they were before confuÅ¿edly diÅ¿perÅ¿ed.</p>
            <p>Thus was the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Flowers</hi> begun indeed by Å¿uch <hi>Gard'ners</hi> as thoÅ¿e we juÅ¿t now mentioned, becauÅ¿e there were no others that could do it; but when Men had a mind to have Å¿o great a number of them, as is now practiÅ¿ed by way of Ornament, to the palaces of <hi>Great PerÅ¿ons,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to make particular <hi>Gardens</hi> of them which they called by a name
<pb facs="tcp:48210:4"/>
proper to a <hi>Flower Garden;</hi> and becauÅ¿e it was not poÅ¿Å¿ible for one <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ner</hi> at the Å¿ame time, to manage the <hi>Culture</hi> of Å¿o great a number of <hi>Fruits, Legumes, Flowers, Shrubs,</hi> &amp;c. as were then required, there was a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing a Å¿econd <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> to eaÅ¿e thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t, which new <hi>Gard'ners</hi> were commonly named <hi>FloriÅ¿ts,</hi> to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h them from the others, which were called only plain <hi>Gard'ners.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Flower Gard'ners <hi>or</hi> FloriÅ¿h.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I might tell you here by the way, that in thoÅ¿e times, <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-trees,</hi> were perhaps look'd upon as Trees only for <hi>Flowers,</hi> juÅ¿t as the <hi>Myrtles, JeÅ¿Å¿imins,</hi> and <hi>LauruÅ¿tinus-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. are now, the delicacy of Mens palates being not arrived to that degree of Luxury, to Å¿eek after Å¿o many Å¿orts of ReliÅ¿hes, Sawces, and Å¿eaÅ¿onings as now; Å¿o that 'tis very poÅ¿Å¿ible, that <hi>Limon</hi> and <hi>Orange-trees</hi> might then belong only to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> of the <hi>FloriÅ¿ts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet methinks it may be more probably affirmed, that in thoÅ¿e ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly times, thoÅ¿e Trees were not diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from <hi>Fruit-trees,</hi> Å¿ince they are truly Å¿o; and therefore I am apt to believe, they were cultivated by the firÅ¿t <hi>Gard'ners</hi> only for their <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that the rather, becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t <hi>Culture</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> being begun in hot and temperate Countries; the Å¿lavery and trouble of <hi>Boxes,</hi> and <hi>ConÅ¿ervatories,</hi> which in our <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> they cannot be without, were there of no uÅ¿e at all. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rigour of the <hi>Winter</hi> SeaÅ¿on in cooler Regions that gave occaÅ¿ion to thoÅ¿e Inventions for the preÅ¿erving of thoÅ¿e plants that were of too tender a ConÅ¿titution to endure any great Cold, and then the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> of the Å¿econd ClaÅ¿s, who otherwiÅ¿e were not over-much taken up with the <hi>Culture</hi> of their <hi>Flowers,</hi> begun to be charged with the care of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Limon-trees.</hi>

            <p>Having Å¿poken largely enough of the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:48210:4"/>
formerly perfect Fenns or MarÅ¿hes, which were afterwards drained and laid dry, Å¿o that in Vulgar Speech, thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> were termed <hi>MarÅ¿h Gard'ners,</hi> which was as much as to Å¿ay, <hi>Gard'ners</hi> of dryed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hes or Fenns. And the vent of thoÅ¿e <hi>Herbs,</hi> proving by the Å¿ucceÅ¿s Å¿o profitable to thoÅ¿e that made it, Å¿tirred up Mens InduÅ¿try to multiply that Å¿ort of <hi>Gardens,</hi> even in very dry and Å¿andy places, and to Å¿upply with their frequent Waterings, and improvements with plenty of Dung, the defects of goodneÅ¿s in the Ground.</p>
            <p>This Account which I here give, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hes clearly three <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ners</hi> very different one from the other, without mentioning the other two <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> viz. that of thoÅ¿e <hi>Gard'ners</hi> that mind only <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> and the <note place="margin">NurÅ¿ery Gard'ners<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> BotaniÅ¿ts.</note> other of thoÅ¿e that conÅ¿ine themÅ¿elves to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Rare</hi> and <hi>Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Plants;</hi> and yet 'tis certain, there are Å¿ome very able and knowing PerÅ¿ons, that make it their PleaÅ¿ure and BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s too, to cultivate both of them, and to perform it with SucceÅ¿s and Reputation.</p>
            <p>But as for my own inclination, it was always fixed to that Å¿ort of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ning</hi> that was known in the infancy of the <hi>World,</hi> and practiÅ¿ed by our firÅ¿t <hi>Parents,</hi> Å¿o that for a long time, I have particularly applyed my Å¿elf to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Kitchin Gardens.</hi> And by this Application, having not only diÅ¿covered a great number of Beauties, but likewiÅ¿e a great many Faults that are committed in that Å¿ort of <hi>Gardening,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think my Å¿elf obliged before all things, to deÅ¿cribe them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they may be avoided.</p>
            <p>I find then firÅ¿t, that commonly theÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Gardens</hi> are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniÅ¿h'd with what they Å¿hould, and might eaÅ¿ily have for each Å¿eaÅ¿on of the Year, whether <hi>Fruits</hi> or <hi>Legumes,</hi> but that beÅ¿ides, they are ill contrived in the <hi>DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition</hi> and <hi>Ranking</hi> of the things contained in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That there appears but little skill and capacity in moÅ¿t of the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> that cultivate them, and as little underÅ¿tanding in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters that employ them, to know how to direct them better; Å¿o that uÅ¿ually 'tis the fault both of the Owners, and their <hi>Gard'ners</hi> too, that thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Gardens</hi> come Å¿hort of yielding either that PleaÅ¿ure or Profit they might otherwiÅ¿e do, and which was expected from them.</p>
            <p>I will do what I can, to remedy thoÅ¿e great Failings, as well out of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Orders I have received to that effect, as out of an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to pleaÅ¿ure others, an inclination which I dare affirm natural to me, and eÅ¿pecially in affairs of <hi>Gardening,</hi> which of it <note n="*" place="margin">

But then to balance theÅ¿e few good Authors, what a multitude of other Books have we to exclaim againÅ¿t, with which we are overwhelmed? The moÅ¿t part of which, I may without injuÅ¿tice affirm, are not to be lookt upon otherwiÅ¿e than as troubleÅ¿om <hi>TranÅ¿lations,</hi> and nauÅ¿eous <hi>Repetitions</hi> of Å¿everal old <hi>Maxims,</hi> which I hope, I Å¿hall carefully mark out to you, and demonÅ¿trate at the Å¿ame time to be for the moÅ¿t part <hi>faulty,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t very <hi>inÅ¿igniÅ¿icant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Å¿econd ReaÅ¿on that obliges me to write, is the aÅ¿Å¿urance I have, that I am the CauÅ¿e of peoples acting erroneouÅ¿ly in many <hi>Gardens,</hi> though it be the moÅ¿t innocently in the World on my Å¿ide, which proceeds from the inconÅ¿iderate conduct of certain PerÅ¿ons that being prejudiced with too favourable a conceit of my Abilities in this kind, when they Å¿ee what I do in our <hi>Kitchin Gardens,</hi> and to our <hi>Fruit-trees,</hi> are Å¿ometimes tempted blindly to imitate my <hi>Practice;</hi> but becauÅ¿e they are ignorant of my <hi>Principles,</hi> and think it would reflect too much upon their Reputation, to Å¿toop Å¿o low as to ask me them, they venture to gueÅ¿s at them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, thinking without doubt that nothing is Å¿o eaÅ¿ie as to hit them right.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear telling them, and I deÅ¿ire them not totake it ill, that 'tis a very rare thing to gueÅ¿s right inalmoÅ¿t any Å¿ort of matter whatÅ¿oever; and though it be true, that this of our <hi>Art</hi> is not at all difficult to underÅ¿tand when 'tis illuÅ¿trated and made out with good ReaÅ¿ons, yet moÅ¿t common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people are not very lucky in hitting upon them at a venture, without Å¿ome inÅ¿truction; for alas, by following their firÅ¿t imaginations, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten run the hazard of acting juÅ¿t the contrary to what I practiÅ¿e, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently to what they deÅ¿ign, when they think of nothing but gueÅ¿Å¿ing.</p>
            <p>For Example, in matter of Pruning, one Gentleman, becauÅ¿e he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erves Å¿ome Å¿hort Branches upon my Trees, Å¿ays preÅ¿ently, he Å¿ees well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that my way of <hi>pruning</hi> is to cut Å¿hort, and keeps to that. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauÅ¿e he has Å¿een Å¿ome long ones upon them, concludes as peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily on his Side, that my method is to cut long, and that he fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tands it. LaÅ¿tly, a third, becauÅ¿e he has once obÅ¿erved me at the Å¿ame time, to cut Å¿ome Branches Å¿hort, and others long; if another time he returns and Å¿ees any Trees with a different Face from what he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preÅ¿ently accuÅ¿es me of uncertainty in my <hi>Principles;</hi> nay, and takes the liberty to Å¿ay, he Å¿ees much inconÅ¿tancy in my <hi>pruning,</hi> and therefore, that I have no certain Rule to go by in that <hi>Operation,</hi> and thereupon as he fanÅ¿ies, makes the fineÅ¿t reflections in the World, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take for the future a quite diÅ¿Å¿erent way from mine.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t being one of that Å¿ort of haÅ¿ty Spirits, that think they can comprehend any thing at firÅ¿t Å¿ight, makes, as I may Å¿ay, great MaÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres upon the Trees, whilÅ¿t thinking to imitate my manner of pruning, he takes a ReÅ¿olution to cut cloÅ¿e in all occaÅ¿ions.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd, with the like Intention, ruines in little time the Beauty of his Trees, by leaving thoÅ¿e Branches long, which Å¿hould be cut Å¿hort.</p>
            <p>And laÅ¿tly, the third Å¿alls into Å¿uch a perplexity, that he knows not which way to take.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e are the GulÅ¿s into which the falÅ¿e ReaÅ¿onings from bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectures and probabilities lead and decoy Men. And therefore though I
<pb facs="tcp:48210:5"/>
Å¿hould do nothing elÅ¿e in this Book, but give an account of my Conduct, by explaining for Example, what Å¿ort of Branches I cut Å¿hort, and what I leave long; what Trees I leave loaden with more Branches, and which with fewer, &amp;c. with the motives why I do Å¿o, I think it would be no Å¿mall benefit to the Publick, that they who Å¿hall be thus informed of them, may not torment their Heads Å¿o much any more with gueÅ¿Å¿ing, nor conÅ¿equently be Å¿o eaÅ¿ily induced to venture upon erroneous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>This done, if my Conduct be approved it will be imitated, at which I Å¿hall be extreamly Å¿atisfied, becauÅ¿e of the intereÅ¿t I have, that every one Å¿hould be pleaÅ¿ed; and if it be not liked, it will be condemned, and perhaps may incite Å¿ome charitable cenÅ¿urer to publiÅ¿h a better, at which I Å¿hall be no leÅ¿s pleaÅ¿ed, becauÅ¿e of the paÅ¿Å¿ionate deÅ¿ire I have to improve my Å¿elf to more and more perfection in this matter.</p>
            <p>In fine, the third and laÅ¿t reaÅ¿on that obliges me to write, is the hopes I have, that the reading of this Book will be advantageous in two other ReÅ¿pects, of which I think I ought to make Å¿ome account.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t is, That every one of my <hi>Maxims</hi> being fully underÅ¿tood in their whole extent, as I intend they Å¿hould, and as they may be, by what I have written to explain them, will, if I miÅ¿take not, give Å¿ome light to direct people to take better methods in <hi>Gardening.</hi> But if through Malice or Ignorance, any PerÅ¿on Å¿hall follow one part of any of my <hi>Rules,</hi> without obÅ¿erving the other, I am confident he will find himÅ¿elf very much deceived, and therefore do here Å¿incerely advertiÅ¿e all concerned, to obÅ¿erve that Caution, that I may not be reÅ¿ponÅ¿ible for all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences they will infallibly fall into, as often as they Å¿hall Å¿cruple en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to believe me.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd is, becauÅ¿e moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e unskilÅ¿ul <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> as have Å¿een only with a CurÅ¿ory view what I do, or perhaps have only heard of it by the Relation of others, if they Å¿ucceed ill, as it but too often happens, they preÅ¿ently have an excuÅ¿e ready, and without Å¿cruple diÅ¿charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves of their Faults, by throwing them on <hi>me;</hi> they make <hi>me</hi> the Author of all their miÅ¿-managements, thinking to Authorize by my Name what they cannot otherwiÅ¿e defend; they will needs have me to have brought in Å¿uch and Å¿uch a uÅ¿e, which never entred intomy thoughts, and Å¿ay they have done Å¿uch and Å¿uch things, purpoÅ¿ely to imitate <hi>me,</hi> and to let the World Å¿ee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be Å¿o much reaÅ¿on to imitate <hi>me,</hi> as is pretended. AgainÅ¿t theÅ¿e Pleas, I Å¿hall now at leaÅ¿t have an irrefragable juÅ¿tification in Writing, Å¿o that it being in no Man's power to pretend I have Å¿aid any thing but what I have really Å¿aid, I Å¿hall by this means prevent Å¿uch imputations for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and perhaps <note n="*" place="margin">As it is a thing of great uÅ¿e, to work skilfully in <hi>Agriculture,</hi> Å¿o it is much more pernicious to do any thing in it ill, than to do nothing at all. <hi>Xencplion.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:6"/>
I know well enough, that all Books of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> have uÅ¿ually begun with a Preface full of the praiÅ¿es given to it, and that conÅ¿cquently it may be thought, this ought to begin Å¿o too. But Å¿ince I am far from preÅ¿uming my Å¿elf able to Å¿ay any thing new, that may at all enhance the eÅ¿teem which is due to <hi>Gardens,</hi> or to the <hi>Art</hi> that teaches their ConÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore cannot but think it very impertinent to go about to perÅ¿uade any one to Å¿tudy it; when I obÅ¿erve the moÅ¿t part of Men poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿s'd with a natural paÅ¿Å¿ion for Å¿o Å¿weet and profitable an Occupation, I Å¿hall wave thoÅ¿e Complements, and fall down-right upon the purÅ¿uit of my DeÅ¿ign, which is to inÅ¿truct, in caÅ¿e I can Å¿how my Å¿elf really maÅ¿ter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the <hi>Art,</hi> worthily to perform it.</p>

            <p>And afterwards in the Å¿ame firÅ¿t Part, I will, if my Judgment deceive me not, give directions how to make a diÅ¿creet choice of able <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> which I reckon to be one of the moÅ¿t important points to be lookt after in this matter. And laÅ¿tly to prevent any doubts or perplexities, our Gentlemen <hi>Candidates,</hi> or young beginners in theÅ¿e <hi>CurioÅ¿ities</hi> may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for want of a right underÅ¿tanding of certain Terms of <hi>Gardening,</hi> which I Å¿hall uÅ¿e in this TreatiÅ¿e, I have added a little <hi>Dictionary</hi> of them at the end, which gives as full an explanation of them, as is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make them intelligible to the meaneÅ¿t Readers.</p>
            <p>In the Å¿econd part, I Å¿hall firÅ¿t Å¿hew what Qualities are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make any piece of Ground fit to be converted into a <hi>Garden,</hi> that may <note place="margin">The Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Å¿econd part.</note> be both profitable and delightful. Next I Å¿hall direct what is to be done in order to the right preparation of thoÅ¿e Grounds, that are naturally pretty good, and the melioration and improvement of thoÅ¿e which are not Å¿o; and how to model any Fruit or <hi>Kitchin Garden</hi> whatÅ¿oever, great or little, regular or irregular, well or ill Å¿ituated, as well for the moÅ¿t advantageous diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of its <hi>encloÅ¿ure,</hi> and well garniÅ¿hing its <hi>Walls,</hi> as of the <hi>Ground</hi> in the middle, that the whole may be Å¿o well imployed, that it may not only court our <hi>SenÅ¿es</hi> with the Charms of <hi>NeatneÅ¿s</hi> and <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but be rendred more eaÅ¿ie and convenient to <hi>Cultivate,</hi> and Å¿o com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiÅ¿ant and good natur'd, as above all, to reward our Labours with a
<pb facs="tcp:48210:6"/>
competent Å¿tore not only of all Å¿orts of <hi>Legumes,</hi> but particularly of choice, good and lovely <hi>Fruits.</hi> And laÅ¿tly, I will lay down inÅ¿tructions how to cultivate <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> throughout the whole Year, and how to recruit them with freÅ¿h <hi>Amendments,</hi> as often as they Å¿hall need it.</p>
            <p>In the Third Part, I will endeavour to deÅ¿cribe which are in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <note place="margin">The SubÅ¿tance of the third part.</note> the choiceÅ¿t Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> that Gentlemen may not only be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by induced to chuÅ¿e none but them, but may be directed how to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the number of each of them in every <hi>Garden,</hi> and becauÅ¿e 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know only in general, which are the principal Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I Å¿hall alÅ¿o Å¿pecifie in particular which are the beÅ¿t in every Month, how long each Å¿ort of them uÅ¿ually laÅ¿t, and as near as can well be calculated, what quantity of <hi>Fruit</hi> each <hi>Tree</hi> may be expected to yield at its firÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to bear, after three, four, five, or Å¿ix years planting, when it is well ordered, that Gentlemen may take their meaÅ¿ures accordingly, Å¿o as to be furniÅ¿ht with Å¿uch a Å¿tore of them, that may be Å¿ufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the paÅ¿Å¿ion they may have for <hi>Fruit.</hi> I will likewiÅ¿e give Directions at the Å¿ame time, how to aÅ¿Å¿ign each <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> the place that is moÅ¿t proper and effectual to make it thrive and proÅ¿per. And, Secondly, how to chuÅ¿e Å¿uch well qualified <hi>Stocks</hi> of every Å¿ort of Tree, as may truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve a place in a <hi>Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, how to prepare them by trimming both their <hi>Tops</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> in order to plant them; and, LaÅ¿tly, how to plant them well; all which are ObÅ¿ervations Å¿o abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that without them, 'tis impoÅ¿Å¿ible not to commit very great errours.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Part, I will treat of the <hi>pruning,</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> according to the <note place="margin">The SubÅ¿tÃ nce of the fourth part.</note> method practiÅ¿ed by my Self; and afterwards I will deÅ¿cribe my way of <hi>pinching Å¿ome of them,</hi> and of <hi>disbudding</hi> or <hi>thinning their Leaves, nailing them up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Part, I will direct how to thin them of their <hi>Fruit,</hi> by plucking off as many as occaÅ¿ion Å¿hall require, where they grow too thick, for we are not to leave Å¿o many <hi>Fruit</hi> upon a <hi>Tree,</hi> as it had BloÅ¿Å¿oms, but have reaÅ¿on rather to be Å¿uÅ¿picious of thoÅ¿e that bloÅ¿Å¿om too much, the exceÅ¿s of their good Will, if I may Å¿o Å¿ay, being to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a great Fault, becauÅ¿e it moÅ¿t certainly diÅ¿ables them from bringing their products to perfection.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall alÅ¿o give inÅ¿tructions when 'twill be proper to uncover Å¿uch <hi>Fruit</hi> as we Å¿hall have left growing, in order to their attaining that beauty of colour, and accompliÅ¿ht goodneÅ¿s which are agreeable to their kind; as alÅ¿o, exactly when to gather both thoÅ¿e which ripen on the <hi>Tree,</hi> and thoÅ¿e which attain not their full ripeneÅ¿s there, but muÅ¿t be laid up to mellow in the HouÅ¿e. AlÅ¿o,</p>
            <p>How to keep them as long as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible, for which purpoÅ¿e, I Å¿hall give all neceÅ¿Å¿ary Directions for the Building, ExpoÅ¿ition, and DiÅ¿poÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Store-houÅ¿es</hi> for <hi>Fruit.</hi> And, LaÅ¿tly, I Å¿hall direct how to know when any Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit</hi> is ripe, and when it may Å¿eaÅ¿onably be Å¿erved up to be eaten, whether it be Å¿uch as will not keep, Å¿uch as are all <hi>Summer-Fruits,</hi> or Å¿uch as is laid up in the <hi>Store-houÅ¿e</hi> to be kept, of which <hi>ClaÅ¿s,</hi> are <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter Fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Å¿ame fifth part, I intend likewiÅ¿e to treat of Å¿ome DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es of <hi>Trees</hi> that may be cured, where I Å¿hall ingenuouÅ¿ly declare at the Å¿ame time, which are thoÅ¿e againÅ¿t which I have been able yet to find no Remedy: AlÅ¿o to reÅ¿tore thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> to their former vigour which are fallen into a languiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition, for want of good <hi>Culture.</hi> And, LaÅ¿tly, to lay down In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructions, how to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h thoÅ¿e which are paÅ¿t recovery, that Å¿o no PerÅ¿on may be at any further expence of time, or Pains or Money upon
<pb facs="tcp:48210:7"/>
them, to no purpoÅ¿e. I likewiÅ¿e pretend in the Å¿ame fifth part, to give all the inÅ¿ight that is needful for the management of <hi>NurÅ¿eries</hi> of all Å¿orts of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> as well in reÅ¿pect to the choice of <hi>Stocks</hi> moÅ¿t proper to receive <hi>Grafts</hi> of what kind Å¿oever, as to the <hi>Grafting</hi> them in Å¿uch a manner, as may be moÅ¿t agreeable both to each Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit</hi> to be Grafted, and to each <hi>Stock</hi> to be Grafted on. I Å¿hall therefore alÅ¿o give my advice about the different ways of <hi>TrelliÅ¿Å¿ing</hi> and <hi>Nailing</hi> up <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, in the Å¿ixth part, I intend to treat of <hi>Kitchin-Gardens;</hi> which is a Å¿ubject of no leÅ¿s vaÅ¿t extent than profit, when it falls into the hands of PerÅ¿ons that underÅ¿tand, and manage it aright. I Å¿hall therefore Treat of it Å¿omewhat Largely; with deÅ¿ign to Å¿hew,</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, what may profitably enter into all Å¿orts of <hi>Kitchin-Gardens,</hi> Å¿o compleatly to Å¿tock them that it may be Å¿aid, there's nothing wanting in them, to which I Å¿hall add a DeÅ¿cription of all Å¿eeds and other things, by which each particular Å¿ort of plant is produced and multiplyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I Å¿hall Å¿pecifie what products and proviÅ¿ions, a <hi>Kitchin-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Å¿hould furniÅ¿h us with every Month of the <hi>Tear,</hi> and what Å¿hould be the work of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> in every one of thoÅ¿e Months, and Å¿hew how to do them well; and laÅ¿tly, what Å¿hould be found in every <hi>Kitchin-Garden,</hi> at all Å¿eaÅ¿ons, to convince us it is in a good Condition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what Å¿ort of <hi>Ground</hi> is moÅ¿t proper for every particular Å¿ort of Plant, to bring it to its due perfection, and more eÅ¿pecially which is the beÅ¿t way to make all Å¿orts of <hi>Legumes</hi> turn to account, and anÅ¿wer expectation, whether they be Å¿uch as are Å¿own not to be removed, or Å¿uch as muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be tranÅ¿planted, or laÅ¿tly, Å¿uch as are propagated without Å¿owing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, how long each of them occupies its place, as well before it arrives to its due perfection, as whilÅ¿t it continues bearing. I will alÅ¿o Å¿pecifie at the Å¿ame time, what plants muÅ¿t be houÅ¿ed up in the <hi>ConÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> for our <hi>Winter ProviÅ¿ions,</hi> and what by the help of Art and InduÅ¿try, may be produced inÅ¿pite of the Å¿roÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, I Å¿hall Teach how to raiÅ¿e all Å¿ort of Å¿eeds, for the more eaÅ¿ie maintainance of our <hi>Kitchin-Garden</hi> in full Å¿tock, and Å¿hall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how long time each Å¿ort will keep good, they having not all the Å¿ame deÅ¿tiny in that reÅ¿pect.</p>
            <p>And a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> that could but underÅ¿tand, what I have juÅ¿t now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed in the aboveÅ¿aid, would in all likewiÅ¿e be as fit as could be deÅ¿ired, for an ordinary <hi>Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, in my opinion, it would be further needful for him to have Å¿ome little underÅ¿tanding, in the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which, as we have above remarked, are indeed properly <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> though very often they are not Å¿o much conÅ¿idered for their <hi>Fruit,</hi> as for the <hi>Flowers</hi> expected from them; neither is that <hi>Culture</hi> any thing nigh Å¿o dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as has been hitherto imagined. And likewiÅ¿e without any deÅ¿ign, to encroach too much upon Å¿o many skilful <hi>ArtiÅ¿ts,</hi> whoÅ¿e peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it is, to deal in all thoÅ¿e Beauteous plants, that CompoÅ¿e the rich enamellings of <hi>Parterres,</hi> and <hi>Flower Plots,</hi> I may venture to put in a word or two, concerning the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿imins,</hi> and moÅ¿t of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Flowers,</hi> which may be had every Month in the <hi>Tear,</hi> which I Å¿hall do whilÅ¿t I am treating of the products and proviÅ¿ions of each Month, in the Å¿ame Sixth part. And it is certain, we may have Å¿ome few <hi>Flowers</hi> in moÅ¿t <hi>Gardens</hi> of any reaÅ¿onable bigneÅ¿s, and have them betimes too, witneÅ¿s that famous <hi>Gard'ner</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">Primui vere RoÅ¿em, at<expan>

            <p>Perhaps in this Sixth part, an <hi>Ordinary Gard'ner</hi> will find light enough to enable him to content a <hi>MaÅ¿ter,</hi> that has but a moderate paÅ¿Å¿ion for <hi>Flowers:</hi> and that's all I propoÅ¿ed to my Å¿elf, by the inÅ¿tructions I have inÅ¿erted relating to them.

            <p>For it is indeed the intereÅ¿t of every one, of what <hi>Quality</hi> Å¿oever he may be, timely to reÅ¿olve not only to chooÅ¿e that Å¿ort of <hi>Garden</hi> he fanÅ¿ies beÅ¿t, but eÅ¿pecially to be Cautious how he undertakes to plant a Larger one, than his conveniences will permit, that he may not be obliged to charge himÅ¿elf with more <hi>Gard'ners</hi> than he can eaÅ¿ily maintain, and than are abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary for a Gentleman of his EÅ¿tate and CircumÅ¿tances.

And there is an infinite number of other CurioÅ¿ities of that nature, the knowledge of which would doubtleÅ¿s give a great deal of pleaÅ¿ure to <hi>Learned Men;</hi> but yet perhaps would not add any thing conÅ¿iderable to the skill or capacity of our <hi>Work-man,</hi> which is, as I have Å¿aid, my principal aim in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e.

As for example, methinks 'tis very material, to know in Å¿ome competent meaÅ¿ure, the beginning and order of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:8"/>
to know what the <hi>Sap</hi> does both in the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it abounds more or leÅ¿s in each of them, whether Å¿trong or Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; to know what <hi>Branches</hi> are beÅ¿t diÅ¿poÅ¿ed for bearing of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and which for producing of <hi>Wood;</hi> to know the reaÅ¿ons of <hi>Tillage,</hi> and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, and Å¿everal other things no leÅ¿s uÅ¿eful than thoÅ¿e. BecauÅ¿e without knowing Å¿uch points as theÅ¿e, we could eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h no certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>pruning</hi> either <hi>Roots</hi> or <hi>Branches;</hi> of making <hi>Trees</hi> flouriÅ¿h, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing them into a Condition to be able to bear fine <hi>Fruit;</hi> of making all Å¿orts of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> vigorous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the things I think moÅ¿t particularly neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be known.</p>
            <p>And accordingly 'tis in the deciÅ¿ion of theÅ¿e Å¿orts of difficulties that I have endeavoured to reaÅ¿on with the greateÅ¿t evidence I could, the better to confirm the InÅ¿tructions I give, and which I found only upon very frequent, very long and very exact obÅ¿ervations made by my own Å¿elf in all the parts of <hi>Gardening,</hi> without taking any thing upon truÅ¿t, upon the report of any other PerÅ¿on. So that here I communicate to the World all the light I have acquired in this Å¿ort of <hi>Agriculture:</hi> and in Å¿o doing, I give an account of all I have obÅ¿erved <hi>Nature</hi> to do in the production of <hi>Vegetables.</hi> And I give this account not only without any reÅ¿erve, but Å¿incerely and faithfully, and according to the beÅ¿t of my Å¿lender Skill and Capacity. I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿s'd my Å¿elf in the plaineÅ¿t manner I poÅ¿Å¿ibly could, as being well enough convinced, that this kind of matter, requires no lofty or Å¿welling Å¿tyle, <note place="margin">Ornari res ipÅ¿a negat, contenta doceri. <hi>Horace.</hi>
               </note> and needs no greater ornament than to be Å¿et in a clear light, and to be well explained, and well underÅ¿tood.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall here add, That the third Part of this Work, where I treat of the choice and proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> was that which coÅ¿t me the greateÅ¿t pains of any, and that which, if I miÅ¿take not, will prove one of the moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful. My undertaking therein is as <hi>Great</hi> as <hi>New;</hi> that which makes me call it <hi>New,</hi> is becauÅ¿e that hitherto I never knew any Body that ever projected the like: And that which induces me to call it <hi>Great,</hi> is the great variety of matter, which I am to treat of in it; which though it be common and ordinary, yet is little underÅ¿tood, and conÅ¿equently gives a great deal of trouble to moÅ¿t <hi>adventurers</hi> in theÅ¿e <hi>CurioÅ¿ities.</hi> ThoÅ¿e Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the choice of the beÅ¿t <hi>Fruits,</hi> that proportion of number to be obÅ¿erved of <hi>Trees</hi> of every kind, according to the bigneÅ¿s of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> and the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Ground. ThoÅ¿e Rules for the <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>DiÅ¿tances,</hi> &amp;c. which I there lay down, are all matters of very great importance in Gard'ning; of which therefore 'tis Å¿o highly neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be well informed, that 'twill be otherwiÅ¿e impracticable, to plant with Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>But what I find moÅ¿t troubleÅ¿ome in this attempt, is, that 'tis impoÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform it in few Words: Å¿o that to manage it with the conduct it requires, I find my Å¿elf obliged to make a large diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion, and under an indiÅ¿penÅ¿ible neceÅ¿Å¿ity to promiÅ¿e a Preface too, both Å¿omewhat long, and perhaps altogether tedious, both to my Å¿elf, and to thoÅ¿e for whoÅ¿e Service I make it. So that though I Å¿hould not otherwiÅ¿e have misfortune enough by giving occaÅ¿ion to Å¿ome curious Gentlemen to quarrel with me, for the judgment I Å¿hall give of every particular Å¿ort of Fruit, whether I Å¿hould care or not for their exceptions; yet the frightful number of difficulties I muÅ¿t expect to meet with in the Execution of a DeÅ¿ign of Å¿o great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, might be alone Å¿ufficient to make me loÅ¿e Courage, and indeed had almoÅ¿t actually prevail'd with me to deÅ¿iÅ¿t, not only while I was but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, but after I had made a conÅ¿iderable ProgreÅ¿s in it.</p>

However being perÅ¿waded on one Å¿ide, that my Work would have been much leÅ¿s uÅ¿eful than I intended it Å¿hould, if this part had been wanting to it, and on the other hand, being extremely zealous to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, and no leÅ¿s averÅ¿e from the leaÅ¿t inclination to offend any body, I took courage to purÅ¿ue my project, in good hopes, that at leaÅ¿t a conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of thoÅ¿e <hi>Admirers of Fruit and Fruit-Trees,</hi> and which are the only PerÅ¿ons, which I value in this matter, and for whom I deÅ¿igned it, will kindly accept a work which Å¿o much Å¿hortens their way; And if there happen to be any among them that may think they have reaÅ¿on to find fault with my palate, becauÅ¿e they will not always find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their own, I have reaÅ¿on to believe they will do it without any diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure at me, or railing at my innocent deÅ¿ign, Å¿ince I pretend not to confine, or blame any man in point of <hi>TaÅ¿te.</hi> No, I know well enough, that by the order of <hi>Nature,</hi> every Man is <hi>Soveraign Judge</hi> of his own cauÅ¿e in that QueÅ¿tion, as well as I, Å¿o that as we Å¿ay commonly, Peoples <hi>TaÅ¿tes</hi> are not to be diÅ¿puted.</p>

            <p>This ConÅ¿ideration neceÅ¿Å¿arily engages me to give very long, and very particular accounts of things, for which exactneÅ¿s, I demand before hand Å¿ome Indulgence, not doubting but to moÅ¿t Readers, it may Å¿eem too great; but I have likewiÅ¿e no leÅ¿s reaÅ¿on to believe, that if it were leÅ¿s, it would be attended by many much more offenÅ¿ive faults of another kind.</p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, if the length of this TreatiÅ¿e diÅ¿guÅ¿ts any PerÅ¿ons from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, in all likely-hood 'twill be Å¿uch as are wholly taken up with greater buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es than this, at which I am very well Å¿atisfied, it being only intended for People not otherwiÅ¿e employed, and for hours of Recreation: At leaÅ¿t they who will pleaÅ¿e to take the pains to examine my conduct, will Å¿ee for my IuÅ¿tification, that, as I have already Å¿aid, I have not pretended any thing elÅ¿e, but only to declare my opinion, upon the Å¿ubject I treat of in that Third part.</p>
            <p>And if any Gentlemen be content to follow my Judgment, without entring into any diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of the ReaÅ¿ons which I make uÅ¿e of to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, they may let alone, not only my <hi>Preliminary DiÅ¿courÅ¿e,</hi> and my particular <hi>ConÅ¿iderations,</hi> but likewiÅ¿e the <hi>deÅ¿criptions</hi> I have made of the Å¿everal Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits;</hi> and Å¿o may go Å¿trait to the places where I conclude, what I really think is to be done, in order to plant wiÅ¿ely and happily, (which is noted all along in the margent, and more eÅ¿pecially
<pb facs="tcp:48210:9"/>
in the Abridgment I have added at the end of the TreatiÅ¿e) for there 'tis, they will immediately find all the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance they Å¿uppoÅ¿e they need, and for which they are willing to be obliged to me.</p>
            <p>That which moves me to undertake a thing in my opinion, Å¿o uÅ¿eful and Commodious, is, becauÅ¿e when I Å¿ee many <hi>Gardens</hi> of all Å¿orts of Sizes, as it has often hapned, and daily happens to me, I Å¿ee indeed Å¿ome <hi>Fruit</hi> there, but withal at the Å¿ame time, I Å¿ee there the three greateÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to be feared in that reÅ¿pect.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t is, that hardly any Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are well known, (which is no very hopeful Å¿ign of their GoodneÅ¿s) are to be Å¿een there, and which is moÅ¿t of all to be found fault with, the <hi>Good</hi> ones are more Å¿carce there than the <hi>Bad</hi> ones: As for Example, to inÅ¿tance in <hi>Pears,</hi> which of all <hi>Fruits</hi> is that of which men plant moÅ¿t, we Å¿hall commonly find in <hi>Gardens,</hi> more trees of <hi>Catillacs, Orange Pears, BeÅ¿ideri's, White But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pears, Jargonells, Summer Boncretiens,</hi> &amp;c. Than of <hi>Bergamots, Virgoulees, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries, Ambrets, Thorn Pears, RuÅ¿Å¿elets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd Incommodity is, that, if two or three kinds happen to be there that are truly <hi>Good,</hi> they will be there almoÅ¿t all alone, and that pretty often under different Names. For inÅ¿tance, we Å¿hall find a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> planted almoÅ¿t all with <hi>Winter Boncretiens, Butter Pears, MeÅ¿Å¿ire Johns,</hi> &amp;c. or elÅ¿e almoÅ¿t all only with <hi>Virgoulees, RuÅ¿Å¿elets, Verte Longues,</hi> or <hi>Long Green Pears,</hi> &amp;c. without a happy mixture of the one with the other.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, the third and moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable Inconvenience is, that we Å¿eldom Å¿ee in any <hi>Gardens,</hi> a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿o judiciouÅ¿ly contrived, that without any diÅ¿continuation, we may expect a perpetual Å¿upply of them in <hi>Summer, Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> which yet with due regard had to the Quality of their Ground, might eaÅ¿ily be effected; they may perhaps boaÅ¿t, they have a Å¿ufficiency or perhaps too much, either in one of the three <hi>SeaÅ¿ons,</hi> or during Å¿ome part of each of them, as for InÅ¿tance, that they have Å¿ome <hi>Blanquets</hi> or <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets</hi> for <hi>Summer,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Butter Pears</hi> and <hi>Bergamots,</hi> for <hi>Autumn,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Boncretiens</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulees,</hi> for <hi>Winter,</hi> &amp;c. But perhaps, they have Å¿ew other <hi>Fruits,</hi> or perhaps none at all, to furniÅ¿h Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively every <hi>SeaÅ¿on</hi> Å¿o long as it laÅ¿ts, and much leÅ¿s to furniÅ¿h all the whole three <hi>SeaÅ¿ons,</hi> one after another, without intermiÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e are doubtleÅ¿s all very unpleaÅ¿ing <hi>Irregularities,</hi> and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the want of due skill in contrivance, whilÅ¿t a <hi>Garden</hi> is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for at that time, Gentlemen commonly begin firÅ¿t with telling <note place="margin">Dimidium fact i qui benÃ¨ coepit, habet. <hi>Ovid.</hi> A works half done that's well begun.</note> their deÅ¿ign to Å¿ome friends, either to demand their advice, (which is good, if they be perÅ¿ons Skill'd in <hi>Gardening)</hi> or elÅ¿e chiefly to excite their Liberality, if they have any trees to give away, which uÅ¿ually produces, as one may Å¿ay, rather an <hi>HoÅ¿pital,</hi> or confuÅ¿ed <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> than a <hi>Regular Garden;</hi> And if they have not skilful acquaintance to conÅ¿ult, they Å¿end, or perhaps go themÅ¿elves to the <hi>NurÅ¿ery Gardens,</hi> which are ordinarily very ill contrived; they name Å¿ome few Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits</hi> they intend to plant, and for all the reÅ¿t only Å¿ignifie in general, what number of trees they would have, without being able to name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ely the particular Å¿orts they have occaÅ¿ion for, and much leÅ¿s to Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what numbers they want of each. And indeed 'tis becauÅ¿e they are perÅ¿waded, there is no better way to be taken, conÅ¿idering that (if I may have leave to uÅ¿e thoÅ¿e new Terms) there are almoÅ¿t no able <hi>Frugis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ults,</hi> or <hi>Fruit Sages,</hi> nor any good Books of this <hi>Frugis prudence,</hi> or <hi>Science of Fruit Culture,</hi> from which they may furniÅ¿h themÅ¿elves with the neceÅ¿Å¿ary inÅ¿tructions for the contriving of a well modelled <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:9"/>
and therefore they leave all to the DiÅ¿cretion of Å¿ome Plant-Merchant, who perhaps on one Å¿ide, is not very knowing, nor over well Å¿tockt, though at firÅ¿t he endeavours to perÅ¿wade his CuÅ¿tomers, that he has all Å¿orts of good <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> as he would prove by the TeÅ¿timony of Å¿ome old confuÅ¿ed <hi>Catalogue</hi> he fails not to Å¿hew them, and on the other Å¿ide, is above all things deÅ¿irous, to take advantage of the occaÅ¿ion preÅ¿ented him, to put off his ware, becauÅ¿e he is aÅ¿Å¿ured, it will not keep long good.</p>
            <p>So that our new <hi>Curious adventurer</hi> is forced to plant Å¿uch Trees as either his <hi>Friends</hi> have given him, or as the <hi>Plant-Merchant</hi> has Å¿old him, whether they be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad,</hi> and Å¿o provided the number he deÅ¿ired, be compleated, he reÅ¿ts Å¿atisfied and contented, and quietly lets paÅ¿s the firÅ¿t four, or five, or Å¿ix years in expectation, till every Tree may Å¿hew what it is able to perform: And he finds here and there one perhaps, that bears <hi>Fruit,</hi> to amuÅ¿e the MaÅ¿ter's. hopes for Å¿ome while, but at laÅ¿t, time Å¿hews him a true, but too late a Å¿ight of the errours into which he was unhappily fallen.</p>
            <p>But becauÅ¿e the Trees are now grown tall how ill Å¿atisfied Å¿oever a man may be at the <hi>Fruit</hi> they produce, he can hardly find in his heart to reÅ¿olve upon new grafting them, and much leÅ¿s upon beginning a new <hi>Plantation,</hi> Å¿o much afraid are people of engaging in any attempt to correct their firÅ¿t miÅ¿takes, that is attended with the hazard of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new ones equally pernicious; and by that means they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves plunged in the mire, and are Å¿o diÅ¿pirited as to remain in it, vexing in the mean while, to Å¿ee themÅ¿elves deceived of the hopes they had conceived of their beloved project; which produces that DiÅ¿guÅ¿t which we obÅ¿erve Å¿o commonly, to Å¿ieze Å¿ome men, and make them, though at firÅ¿t they appeared paÅ¿Å¿ionately inamoured with their <hi>Gardens,</hi> Å¿eek in a few years after, to get rid of them at any rate.</p>
            <p>There are likewiÅ¿e two other faults that are very common: The firÅ¿t is that for want of knowing the reaÅ¿onable diÅ¿tances that are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved between Trees, with reÅ¿pect to the goodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Ground,</hi> the height of the <hi>Walls,</hi> and the quality of the Å¿everal Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits;</hi> They are oÅ¿ten planted either too nigh to, or too far off one from the other; The Å¿econd is, that likewiÅ¿e for want of duly underÅ¿tanding what <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> agree beÅ¿t with each Å¿ort of Tree, a conÅ¿iderable number of them are often unluckily planted in <hi>unkindly Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it poÅ¿Å¿ible for a man animated with Å¿o warm a Zeal for <hi>Gard'ning</hi> as I am, not to be Å¿enÅ¿ibly touch'd at all theÅ¿e misfortunes, and not to <note place="margin">IgnaroÅ¿<expan>

No, certainly, and therefore, as far as poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I can, I will endeavour to prevent all thoÅ¿e faults, and to lay down directions, how to plant with Å¿o much circumÅ¿pection for the future, that if a Gentleman has a <hi>Garden</hi> big enough to receive any reaÅ¿onable number of Trees, he may have in it all the principal Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are to be had, for every <hi>SeaÅ¿on</hi> of the year.</p>
            <p>This reaÅ¿on that concerns the contriving of a continual Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of <hi>Fruits</hi> throughout all the <hi>SeaÅ¿ons;</hi> may prevail with me Å¿ometimes in <hi>Plantations,</hi> to preferr a meaner <hi>Fruit</hi> before a better, and that becauÅ¿e the better comes in, in a time when I may have a Å¿ufficient proviÅ¿ion of other admirable Å¿orts beÅ¿ides, and the meaner one comes in a Å¿eaÅ¿on, when the Å¿carcity of the moÅ¿t excellent <hi>Fruits</hi> being very great, we think our Å¿elves very happy, if we can be Å¿upplied at leaÅ¿t with Å¿ome of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling goodneÅ¿s: And accordingly for inÅ¿tance, if I had but little room for
<pb facs="tcp:48210:10"/>
               <hi>Dwarf Pear-Trees,</hi> I would plant Å¿ometimes a <hi>Dry Martin,</hi> or a <hi>Bugi</hi> which are pretty good <hi>Winter Pears,</hi> before a <hi>Robine,</hi> or a <hi>Musked Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Boncretien,</hi> &amp;c. which are <hi>Summer Fruits</hi> much better in themÅ¿elves than the two precedent ones. I Å¿hall afterwards Å¿hew what ReaÅ¿ons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to follow this Method.</p>
            <p>They which, as I may without vanity, Å¿ay, know not Å¿o much in this matter as I do, may perhaps be Å¿urpriÅ¿ed at Å¿uch a choice, which without the knowledge of the particular circumÅ¿tances that influenced me to make it, would appear Å¿omewhat odd, but I dare aÅ¿Å¿ure them, they will not find it not very eaÅ¿ie to cenÅ¿ure my <hi>Conduct,</hi> if they will but allow themÅ¿elves time to examine my <hi>ReaÅ¿ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauÅ¿e if a Gentleman, were never Å¿o well Experienced in the Knowledge of the good Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> he would be never the further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, if it were very difficult, or perhaps ImpoÅ¿Å¿ible, to find them in the <hi>NurÅ¿ery Gardens,</hi> this is the AnÅ¿wer I make to Å¿o Important a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>I Hope my exactneÅ¿s in the <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> of <hi>Fruits</hi> I Å¿hall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe, will produce a <hi>Regulation</hi> and kind of <hi>Reformation</hi> in all <hi>NurÅ¿ery Gardens;</hi> I mean, that it will not only baniÅ¿h all confuÅ¿ion, and effects of unskilfullneÅ¿s out of them that have been ill contrived, but will cauÅ¿e new ones to be modelled with all poÅ¿Å¿ible <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>underÅ¿tanding;</hi> And then it will happen, that inÅ¿tead of grafting any more either of thoÅ¿e kinds I reject by name, or of thoÅ¿e I name not, that both of them will grow Å¿o much out of requeÅ¿t, that they will be but loÅ¿t to the <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> and conÅ¿equently they will be obliged for their own intereÅ¿t, to graft on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoÅ¿e which I expreÅ¿s Å¿ome eÅ¿teem for; whether they be new or Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kinds, and none at all of the others, and fewer of thoÅ¿e of which few are to be planted, and more of thoÅ¿e of which I adviÅ¿e to plant the greateÅ¿t number; by which means, the able <hi>Plant-Merchants</hi> may be aÅ¿Å¿ured of a good and never-failing vent for their <hi>Goods</hi> on one Å¿ide, which may encourage them to do better and better, and on the other, all <hi>Gardens</hi> will inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly come to be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed upon a perfect <hi>Model,</hi> which is the main thing aimed at for the pleaÅ¿ure and Å¿atisfaction of all our <hi>Curious</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, till <hi>NurÅ¿eries</hi> can be brought into that Å¿tate of <hi>Perfection</hi> I have propoÅ¿ed, Å¿o that we may one day enjoy the convenience, to find in them a Å¿ufficient Å¿tore of all Å¿orts of good Trees, we may have occaÅ¿ion for, now Gentlemen are informed by the choice I have expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in this TreatiÅ¿e, which are the <hi>Prime Fruits</hi> of every <hi>SeaÅ¿on,</hi> if they happen, among a great number of other <hi>Fruits</hi> which are <hi>rejected,</hi> to find but a part of thoÅ¿e that are <hi>Prized,</hi> they will do well to take rather more of them than they firÅ¿t intended, than to venture to meddle with any of the worÅ¿er kinds. And in doing this, their beÅ¿t way will be, to obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e two reÅ¿olutions, FirÅ¿t, either to plant no Trees but of thoÅ¿e few <hi>Good Å¿orts</hi> which they have found, and to fill up all the places they have to fill, wholly with them, or elÅ¿e to Å¿tay till another year, to gain time to look for thoÅ¿e Å¿orts they could not find the laÅ¿t, rather than to hazard the planting of any <hi>unknown</hi> or <hi>doubtful</hi> kinds.</p>
            <p>And perhaps, as it is very expedient they Å¿hould, they will have Å¿o much wiÅ¿e forecaÅ¿t of themÅ¿elves, to prepare at leaÅ¿t, in the mean while Å¿ome Stocks to graft thoÅ¿e kinds upon the next, which they could not find the laÅ¿t year, and which I have adviÅ¿ed them to plant; which they may do either upon Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e Å¿upernumerary Trees they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken, or upon good <hi>Wildings,</hi> which they may plant ready in their aÅ¿Å¿igned places, for that effect.</p>

            <p>I find they not only underÅ¿tand the Nature and Genius of the Å¿everal Soils; but their uÅ¿ual Infirmities, proper Remedies, CompoÅ¿ts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to Reinvigorate exhauÅ¿ted Mould; Å¿weeten the foul and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reduce the Sower, HarÅ¿h, Stuborn and Dry, or over moiÅ¿t and diluted Earth to its genuine Temper and ConÅ¿titution; and what AÅ¿pects, and Situations are proper for the Å¿everal Å¿orts of Mural, Standard, Dwarf and other Fruite-trees.</p>
            <p>They have made ObÅ¿ervations, and given me a Specimen of that long (but hitherto) wanting particular, of DiÅ¿criminating the Å¿everal kinds of Fruits, by their <hi>CharacteriÅ¿tical</hi> Notes, from a long, and Critical obÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Leafe, TaÅ¿t, Colour,</hi> and other diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing Qualities: So as one Å¿hall not be impos'd upon with <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Several Names;</hi> when as in truth, there is but one due to them. For inÅ¿tance, in <hi>Peares</hi> alone, a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in the Country Å¿ends to the <hi>NuÅ¿eries</hi> for the <hi>Liver Blanch, Piguigny, de chouille, Rattau blane,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> St. <hi>Gilbert, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn Pears</hi> (and Å¿everal other names) when all this while, they are no other than the well known <hi>Cadillac.</hi> The Å¿ame alÅ¿o hap'ning in <hi>Peaches, Apples, Plums, Cherris</hi> and other <hi>Fruit;</hi> for want of an accurate exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb facs="tcp:48210:11"/>
(by comparing of their TaÅ¿te, and thoÅ¿e other Indications I have mentioned) For which Gentlemen complain (and not without cauÅ¿e) that the <hi>NurÅ¿ery-Men</hi> abuÅ¿e them; when 'tis their Ignorance, or the <hi>Exotic</hi> Name of which they are Å¿o fond.</p>
            <p>I find they have likewiÅ¿e apply'd themÅ¿elves to attain a Å¿ufficient MaÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> for general deÅ¿ign, and expeditious Methods for caÅ¿ting and leveling of Grounds; and to bring them into the moÅ¿t apt Form they are capable off; which requires a particular AddreÅ¿s, and to determine the beÅ¿t Proportions of Walks and Avenues, Starrs, Centers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Å¿uitable to the lengths; and how, and with what materials whether <hi>Gravel, Carpet,</hi> &amp;c. to be layed.</p>
            <p>They have a numerous Collection of the beÅ¿t <hi>DeÅ¿igns,</hi> and I perceive are able of themÅ¿elves to Draw, and contrive other, applicable to the places when buÅ¿ie Works, and Parterrs of Imbroidery for the <hi>Coronary</hi> and <hi>Flower Gardens</hi> are proper or deÅ¿ired. And where <hi>Fountaines, Statues, VaÅ¿as, Dials,</hi> and other decorations of Magnificence are to be plac'd with moÅ¿t advantage.</p>
            <p>To this add, a plentiful, and choice Collection of <hi>Orange-trees, Lemon, Mertil, Baies, JaÅ¿Å¿mines,</hi> and all other Rarities, and Exotics, requiring the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory;</hi> after they have embelliÅ¿h't their proper Å¿tations abroad du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Summer,</hi> and for continuing a no leÅ¿s ornament in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> during <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have a very brave and noble AÅ¿Å¿embly of the <hi>Flowery</hi> and other <hi>Trees; Perennial</hi> and variegated <hi>Ever-Greens</hi> and Å¿hrubs, hardy, and fitteÅ¿t for our <hi>Climate;</hi> and underÅ¿tand what beÅ¿t to plant the humble <hi>BoÅ¿cage, WilderneÅ¿s,</hi> or taller <hi>Groves</hi> with: where, and how to diÅ¿poÅ¿e, and govern them, according as Ground, and Å¿ituation of the place requires both for Å¿helter and ornament. For which purpoÅ¿e (and for Walks and Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues) they have Å¿tore of <hi>Elms, Limes, Platans, ConÅ¿tantinople-CheÅ¿nuts, Black-Cherry-trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor are they, I perceive, leÅ¿s knowing in that moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful (though leÅ¿s pompous part of <hi>Horticulture)</hi> the <hi>Potagere, Meloniere, Culinarie Gardent</hi> Where they Å¿hould moÅ¿t properly be plac'd for the use of the Family; how to be planted, furniÅ¿h'd and Cultivated Å¿o as to afford great pleaÅ¿ure to the Eye, as well as profit to the MaÅ¿ter. And they have alÅ¿o <hi>Seeds, Bulbs, Roots, Slips,</hi> for the <hi>Flowery Garden,</hi> and Å¿hew how they ought to be order'd and maintain'd.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, I might Å¿uper-add, the great number of <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> of Noble-men and PerÅ¿ons of Quality, which they have made and planted <hi>ab Origine,</hi> and are Å¿till under their Care and inÅ¿pection (though at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable DiÅ¿tances) and how exceedingly they proÅ¿per, to juÅ¿tifie what I have freely Å¿aid in their behalf.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>NurÅ¿ery</hi> part in Voucher, and to make good what I have Å¿aid on that particular, one needs no more than take a Walk to <hi>Brompton Park</hi> (upon a fair Morning) to behold, and admire what a <hi>Magazine</hi> theÅ¿e InduÅ¿trious Men have provided, fit for age, and Choice in their Å¿everal ClaÅ¿Å¿es; and all within one IncloÅ¿ure: Such an AÅ¿Å¿embly I believe, as is no where elÅ¿e to be met with in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> nor in any other that I know of.</p>

                           <p>How NeceÅ¿Å¿ary it is for a Gentleman, who deÅ¿igns to have <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> to be at leaÅ¿t reaÅ¿onably InÅ¿tructed in what relates to thoÅ¿e Kind of <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THAT Part of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> I begin to treat of here, certainly affords a Gentleman who underÅ¿tands and applies himÅ¿elf to it, a great deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure; but that very <hi>Gard'ning</hi> being manag'd by an unskilful lazy <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> is liable to many Inconveniencies, and Vexations. TheÅ¿e are Two Noted and undeniable Truths, Å¿ince nothing in the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more ForeÅ¿ight and Activity than thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens.</hi> They are, as it were, in a perpetual Motion, which inclines them always to Act either for Good or Ill, according to the good or ill Conduct of their MaÅ¿ter; and Å¿o largely recompence the Ingenious, as they Å¿everely puniÅ¿h the Unskilful.</p>
                        <p>The Proof of my firÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in that certainly nothing affords more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, firÅ¿t, than to have a <hi>Garden</hi> well Å¿eated, of a reaÅ¿onable largeneÅ¿s, and fine Figure, and that perhaps of our own Contriving or Modelling.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd Place, to have that <hi>Garden</hi> at all times not only Neat, for Walking, and to divert the Sight, but likewiÅ¿e abounding in good Things to pleaÅ¿e the Pallate, as well as for the preÅ¿ervation of Health.</p>

Thirdly, daily to meet with Å¿ome new Thing or other to do in it, as to <hi>Sow,</hi> to <hi>Plant,</hi> to <hi>Prune,</hi> to <hi>PalliÅ¿ade,</hi> to Å¿ee <hi>Plants</hi> grow, <hi>Legumes</hi> thrive, <hi>Trees BloÅ¿Å¿om; Fruit</hi> Knitting, then Thickning, Colouring, Ripening, at laÅ¿t come to Gather them, TaÅ¿te them, Treat ones Friends with them, hear their Beauty, GoodneÅ¿s and Abundance commended; all which Things together certainly form a very agreeable Idea, which affords a World of Variety.</p>
                        <p>To prove my Å¿econd PropoÅ¿ition, I Å¿hould only need in few Words to Enumerate all the DiÅ¿orders, wherewith our <hi>Gard'ning</hi> is Threatned, or rather DiÅ¿honour'd when it wants <hi>Culture;</hi> but they are too well known, nothing being Å¿o common as to hear Complaints of that Kind.</p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that there are both PleaÅ¿ures and Vexations in <hi>Gard'ning;</hi> and it is as certain, that the PleaÅ¿ures are reÅ¿erved for Skilful, Active Gard'ners, and the Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions infallibly for thoÅ¿e that are either Lazy or Unskilful.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, it muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be allowed, that thoÅ¿e are neither to be excuÅ¿ed or pitied, who inÅ¿tead of improving the Advantages they expected from their <hi>Gardens,</hi> are reduced to the MiÅ¿ery of laying out a great deal of Money, with LoÅ¿s, DiÅ¿guÅ¿t and cauÅ¿e of Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> While others with a little Skill have avoided all thoÅ¿e DiÅ¿orders, and enjoy all the Delights; from whence it follows, that if an Ingenious Man deÅ¿igns to have a <hi>Garden,</hi> which is a thing Å¿o Å¿uitable to that Qualification, he muÅ¿t abÅ¿olutely think of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Å¿ome Skill in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> or elÅ¿e not meddle with it at all.</p>
                        <p>The grand QueÅ¿tion is to know, whether that Skill, which I think Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary, may be acquir'd with eaÅ¿e or difficulty, now to take a juÅ¿t Medium in this CaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t, which is to know whether it be eaÅ¿ie to acquire that Skil, I am perÅ¿uaded that many Gentlemen would be deÅ¿irous to attain it; for naturally every Body deÅ¿ires it. I am likewiÅ¿e perÅ¿uaded, that the number of Å¿uch would have been conÅ¿iderable already, had there been Å¿ufficient InÅ¿tructions for it.</p>
                        <p>As to the Second CaÅ¿e, whether it be difficult to attain a Å¿ufficient Skill, it is to be fear'd, that few of the Curious will be willing to undertake it; being diÅ¿guÅ¿ted by the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Å¿ucceeding in it, after having Employ'd a great deal of Time and Labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
                        <p>The Honour of having had for Å¿o many Years the Direction of the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen Gardens</hi> of the Royal-Family, Å¿eems to give me Å¿ome Authority to anÅ¿wer that grand QueÅ¿tion: So that, without deÅ¿igning to deceive any Body, and having a great deÅ¿ire to contribute to the Satisfaction of the Ingenious, I affirm that it is very eaÅ¿ie to attain as much Knowledge as is reaÅ¿onably neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Curious, in order to avoid what might vex them, and to put them at the Å¿ame time in a Condition to enjoy their WiÅ¿hes.</p>
                        <p>It will be eaÅ¿ie for me to prove this AÅ¿Å¿ertion, after having Explain'd my Å¿elf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon what I think of all the PleaÅ¿ures that are inÅ¿eparable Companions of that part of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> now in debate.</p>
                        <p>The moÅ¿t ConÅ¿iderable of thoÅ¿e PleaÅ¿ures, is not only to be able to obtain what may <note place="margin">IpÅ¿a ratio aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Å¿pe magis &amp; jucunditate, quam fructu, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que emolumento tenetur, <hi>&amp;c. Cicero.</hi>
                           </note> be produced by <hi>Earth,</hi> that Å¿hall have been well ordered, and a Ground well improv'd with <hi>Trees</hi> that perhaps Å¿hall have been <hi>Graffed, Planted, Prun'd, Cultivated, &amp;c.</hi> by our Å¿elves, though really the Ideas of Å¿uch Injoyments are powerful Charms to Engage us to the Study of them; It conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in a great many other Things, as well for thoÅ¿e that will act themÅ¿elves, as for thoÅ¿e that will only act by their Advice and Orders.</p>
                        <p>In the firÅ¿t Place, to know with certainty what is moÅ¿t proper to be done, in order to make each Part of the <hi>Garden</hi> produce happily and in abundance, what is deÅ¿ired for every Month in the Year. The Judicious <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> as I have already obÅ¿erv'd, never fails in this, of being recompenced of his Labour, Cares and Skill. The Ground he Cultivates <note place="margin">HoneÅ¿tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus omnia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius proveniunt, quoniam &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioÅ¿ius fiunt. <hi>Plinius.</hi>
                           </note> himÅ¿elf, without doubt affords him more ProfuÅ¿ion, being in reality better Cultivated, as if it dreaded, as I may Å¿ay, the Misfortune of belonging to a MaÅ¿ter, who only knows by his <hi>Gard'ner</hi> how it muÅ¿t be uÅ¿ed. It Å¿eems, that to Engage that skilful MaÅ¿ter it belongs to, to continue the Cultivating of it himÅ¿elf, it endeavours to produce more than it uÅ¿ed to do.</p>
                        <p>This PleaÅ¿ure of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> in the Å¿econd Place conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in knowing how to avoid many <note place="margin">In foelix ager, cujus Dominus Villicum audit, non docet. <hi>Columella.</hi>
                           </note> great uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Expences, to which we are often engaged by ill Councils. Is it not uÅ¿ual in moÅ¿t Places to Å¿ee People continually Imploy'd in doing, undoing, and doing again? And moreover is it not common to Å¿ee a great deal of Time, and many Workmen Imploy'd about a thing that might have been done quicker, and by leÅ¿s Hands? So that a great deal of Money is laid out, which often creates great Vexations, and Å¿ometimes great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48210:27"/>
It conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the Third Place, in knowing the Inconveniencies, that I Å¿hall explain in due place, of which Å¿ome are Invincible, and others not: This knowledge Å¿erves to prepare us betimes to receive the firÅ¿t patiently when they happen, and Å¿ecurely to avoid the Å¿econd, without entering into a thouÅ¿and impertinent reaÅ¿ons of an unskilful, careleÅ¿s <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who endeavours to conceal his negligence, or incapacity, by imputing all the DiÅ¿orders, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneÅ¿s of his <hi>Garden</hi> to a wrong cauÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>This PleaÅ¿ure conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the Fourth Place in being able to condemn juÅ¿tly on the one Å¿ide what is amiÅ¿s or ill done in a <hi>Garden,</hi> and on the other to commend what is well, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Rules. There is hardly any thing more natural in all MaÅ¿ters who Å¿peak of their <hi>Gardens,</hi> than to blame or commend Å¿omething in them, as if they really intended thereby to diÅ¿cover what they are; and yet nothing is more dangerous for the Å¿ervice of a <hi>Garden,</hi> nor more diÅ¿agreeable for Å¿uch a MaÅ¿ter than to expoÅ¿e himÅ¿elf to be laugh'd at, or corrected by his <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> which certainly happens when the MaÅ¿ter is not capacitated to Å¿peak like an ArtiÅ¿t upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>It conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the Fifth Place in being reputed capable of giving good advice, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to thoÅ¿e who Å¿tand in need of it: What greater Å¿atisfaction can a man receive, than to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t or undeceive a friend who was in an error, or at a loÅ¿s, and ready to give over his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, putting him afterwards in a way of daily commending the good Fortune his Friend has procured him in his Work?</p>
                        <p>LaÅ¿tly, this PleaÅ¿ure chiefly conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in being capable of judging by our Å¿elves, and for our Å¿elves, of the capacity of a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> either to avoid the Inconveniency of Å¿ometimes diÅ¿charging a good one upon very trivial pitiful reaÅ¿ons, and then taking an ill one in his room, or to reÅ¿olve wiÅ¿ely to diÅ¿card him who has not done his duty, and be able to chuÅ¿e ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better qualify'd.</p>
                        <p>Now if it be true, that there is Å¿o much facility in attaining Å¿o many real PleaÅ¿ures, which I am going to demonÅ¿trate viÅ¿ibly; am I not in the right to conclude that when any body undertakes a <hi>Garden,</hi> without endeavouring to get at leaÅ¿t a Å¿ufficient inÅ¿ight in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> he deÅ¿erves all the diÅ¿guÅ¿ts, which are numerous, inÅ¿tead of deÅ¿erving all the delights, it may produce, the number of which is infinite, and that conÅ¿equently it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿tudy the attaining of Å¿uch a degree of knowledge, as is abÅ¿olutely requiÅ¿ite in thoÅ¿e Affairs?</p>
                        <p>It may perhaps be objected at firÅ¿t, that hereby I propoÅ¿e an Infallible expedient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the moÅ¿t pernicious thing in nature in all manner of affairs, that is, to introduce ScioliÅ¿ts, or Smatterers: The Objections Å¿eems pretty Å¿trong, but the two AnÅ¿wers I am going to make to it, in my opinion, are yet of much more force.</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t is, that when a Gentleman Å¿hall once have attain'd a certain knowledge of Å¿ome Principles capable of affording him a good Tincture of Gard'ning, it is moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he will not reÅ¿t with that bare knowledge of the firÅ¿t Elements, but will infallibly have a paÅ¿Å¿ionate deÅ¿ire of knowing Å¿omething more of an Art, that he is Å¿o much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with. He will Å¿oon improve the knowledge he Å¿hall have acquir'd, and conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not remain long in that dangerous and Å¿o much fear'd Å¿tation, which is call'd Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.</p>
                        <p>The Second AnÅ¿wer, which is no leÅ¿s material, is, that without doubt, that Smattering of an Ingenious PerÅ¿on, if we may call it Å¿o, is much better, being grounded upon good Principles, than the falÅ¿e Notion of knowledge of common <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> it being moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that you Å¿eldom find any thing among Å¿uch beyond a preÅ¿umptuous Pratling Ignorance, upheld by Å¿ome wretched Rote. Is it not a great happineÅ¿s to be able to attain a Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inÅ¿ight into thoÅ¿e matters, and to put our Å¿elves above Å¿o many falÅ¿e reaÅ¿onings, we Å¿hould otherwiÅ¿e be lyable to, and Å¿o avoid a great deal of vexation, to purchaÅ¿e abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of PleaÅ¿ure?</p>

                        <p>The FirÅ¿t relates to the Quality of the <hi>Ground,</hi> its neceÅ¿Å¿ary Depth, to the <hi>Tillage, Amendments</hi> and ordinary modelling of uÅ¿eful <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second relates to the <hi>Trees,</hi> to chuÅ¿e them well qualified, either when they are Å¿till in the <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> or taken from thence, to know at leaÅ¿t the Names of the Principal Kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> of every SeaÅ¿on; to be able to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h them, and what number of each the CompaÅ¿s of his <hi>Garden</hi> may require; to underÅ¿tand how to prepare <hi>Trees</hi> both as to the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> before they are put into the Ground again; and afterwards to place them at a convenient diÅ¿tance, and expoÅ¿e them well; to know, if not all, the Rules of <hi>Pruning,</hi> yet at leaÅ¿t all the Principal ones, either as to <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> how to <hi>Pinch</hi> off Å¿ome <hi>Branches,</hi> being over Vigorous; to PalliÅ¿ade Å¿uch as require it, as alÅ¿o the <hi>Triming</hi> of Å¿uch uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Buds</hi> and <hi>Sprigs</hi> as cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion; and laÅ¿tly to give every one of them the Beauty which they are capable of.</p>
                        <p>The Third Article relates to <hi>Fruit,</hi> to make it grow fine, gather it prudently, and eat it Å¿eaÅ¿onably.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth relates to <hi>Graffs</hi> on all kind of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> whether placed in <hi>Gardens,</hi> or Å¿till in the <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> both as to the Time, and Manner of applying them.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the Fifth Article relates to the general Conduct of all <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially to underÅ¿tand the PleaÅ¿ure and Profit they may yield in every Month of the Year.</p>
                        <p>In my Opinion, the Number of theÅ¿e Articles is not ConÅ¿iderable; and, I aÅ¿Å¿ure the Curious, that they may be fully InÅ¿tructed therein, and in a little Time, by the Å¿hort Abridgment that follows.</p>

                           <p>The Dung of Leaves throughly rotten, is hardly fit for any thing, but to be thrown over new Å¿own Beds, to hinder the Rains or Waterings from beating too much upon the Surface, and Å¿o hinder the Seeds from riÅ¿ing.</p>
                           <p>All the <hi>Legumes</hi> of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> require a great deal of Dung; the <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Layers</hi> of Trees require none.</p>
                           <p>The only good place to put the Amendments in, is towards the Surface.</p>

                           <p>As for the common DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> in my Opinion the beÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t convenient for a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> is that which is made, as much as can be, in well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Squares; Å¿o that if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible the Length may Å¿omewhat exceed the Breadth; the Breadth of the Walks muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be proportion'd, both to their Length and the whole Extent of the <hi>Garden.</hi>

As to <hi>Peach</hi> and <hi>Apricock Trees,</hi> thoÅ¿e that have not been <hi>Graffed</hi> above a Year, provided the <hi>Shoot</hi> be fair, are better than thoÅ¿e that have been <hi>Graffed</hi> Two or more; and yet the <hi>Peach Trees</hi> require more exactneÅ¿s in this than the <hi>Apricocks;</hi> and you muÅ¿t never take a <hi>Peach Tree,</hi> unleÅ¿s it has fine, Å¿ound and whole <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> at the lower part of the <hi>Stem.</hi> The thickneÅ¿s of an Inch, or Å¿omewhat more in Å¿uch <hi>Stems,</hi> is what is particularly to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teem'd in <hi>Peach Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Peaches Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Almond Trees</hi> thrive better in a dry light Ground, than in that which is Loamy and MoiÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>But the clean contrary is to be obÅ¿erv'd for thoÅ¿e that are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Plum-Trees.</hi> In all other Dwarf <hi>Trees,</hi> the thickneÅ¿s muÅ¿t be between Two and Three Inches Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Lower Part.</p>
                           <p>Only excepting <hi>Apple Trees Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Paradice</hi> Stocks, for which the thickneÅ¿s of an Inch is Å¿ufficient.</p>
                           <p>The ThickneÅ¿s of high <hi>Standards</hi> is to conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Five or Six Inches on the Lower Part, and the height of about Six or Seven Foot.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Graff</hi> of little <hi>Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be applied within two or three Fingers from the Ground.</p>
                           <p>And when it cloÅ¿es again, it argues much Vigour in the <hi>Foot,</hi> as well as a great deal of Skill in the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who has had the Ordering of it.</p>

                           <p>Winter <hi>Bon ChreÅ¿tien Pears</hi> can hardly attain that Yellow, and <hi>Carnation</hi> Colour, which is to be deÅ¿ired in them, either upon Dwarfs or Wall Trees being <hi>Graffed</hi> upon free Stocks, and therefore muÅ¿t be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince.</hi>

                           <p>The LongeÅ¿t in <hi>Dwarfs</hi> muÅ¿t not exceed Eight or Nine Inches, and in high <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> about a Foot; you may allow them more Extent, in <hi>Mulberries</hi> and <hi>Cherry-Trees.</hi>

                           <p>In order to Plant well, you muÅ¿t chuÅ¿e dry Weather, to the End that the <hi>Earth</hi> being very dry, it may eaÅ¿ily cling about the <hi>Roots,</hi> and leave no vacuity; and particular Care muÅ¿t be taken leÅ¿t it grow to the ConÅ¿iÅ¿tence of Morter, which afterwards coming to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, might hinder the Production, and the Shooting of the New <hi>Roots.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The beÅ¿t SeaÅ¿on for Planting is from the beginning of <hi>November</hi> until the End of <hi>March;</hi> yet in dry Grounds it is very material to Plant at the very beginning of <hi>November,</hi> but in moiÅ¿t <hi>Soils</hi> it is better to Å¿tay till the beginning of <hi>March.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of <hi>Roots</hi> requires, that the Extremity of the LoweÅ¿t Å¿hould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a full Foot deep into the Ground, and the neareÅ¿t to the Surface, muÅ¿t be covered with Eight or Nine Inches depth of <hi>Mould.</hi> In a dry <hi>Soil</hi> it will not be improper to make a little But or Hillock over thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots,</hi> to hinder the Sun from Å¿poiling of them, and when the <hi>Tree</hi> has taken <hi>Root</hi> into the Ground, it muÅ¿t be Levell'd again.</p>
                           <p>After having <hi>Prun'd</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> you muÅ¿t cut the <hi>Steem</hi> of the Length it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, before you Plant it, and never Å¿tay to cut it till after 'tis Planted.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> I regulate that height to be about Five or Six Inches in a dry <hi>Soil,</hi> and about Eight or Nine when MoiÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>And in <hi>high Standards</hi> the proper height is between Six and Seven Foot in all manner of <hi>Soils.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In Planting, care muÅ¿t be taken to turn the beÅ¿t <hi>Roots</hi> on that Å¿ide which has moÅ¿t <hi>Earth,</hi> and that none, as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, may incline Å¿treight downwards, but rather look towards the HoriÅ¿on.</p>
                           <p>ThoÅ¿e who after planting, Å¿hake or trample on little <hi>Trees,</hi> do them a great deal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; whereas on the contrary, it is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to trample and raiÅ¿e the Ground about the great ones, to Å¿ecure them againÅ¿t the ImpetuoÅ¿ity of the Winds.</p>
                           <p>The Head or Top of <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or <hi>Wall Trees</hi> muÅ¿t lean towards the Wall, yet Å¿o, that the Extremity of the Head muÅ¿t be at Three or Four Inches diÅ¿tance from it, and the Wound muÅ¿t not appear.</p>
                           <p>The diÅ¿tance between them is to be regulated according to the GoodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and particularly according to the height of the Wall; they muÅ¿t be nearer to one another againÅ¿t high Walls, and at more diÅ¿tance againÅ¿t low ones.</p>
                           <p>In this particular CaÅ¿e of the common diÅ¿tance of <hi>Wall Trees,</hi> it is to be regulated from Five or Six Foot, to Ten, Eleven or Twelve. The Walls being Twelve Foot high or more, you muÅ¿t always let one <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hoot up to garniÅ¿h the Top, between two that Å¿hall garniÅ¿h the Bottom; in which caÅ¿e the <hi>Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be planted within Five or Six Foot of one another: But againÅ¿t Walls that are not above Six or Seven Foot high, the diÅ¿tance muÅ¿t be about Nine Foot.</p>
                           <p>The diÅ¿tance of <hi>Dwarfs</hi> muÅ¿t be from between Eight and Nine Foot to Twelve, or even a little more, being <hi>Plum-Trees,</hi> or <hi>Kernel-Fruit</hi> upon Free Stocks.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>high Standards</hi> from Four Fathom to Seven or Eight, for great <hi>Plantations.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In good <hi>Soils</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be at a greater diÅ¿tance than in bad ones, becauÅ¿e there their Heads or Tops Å¿pread more.</p>

When Trenches are newly made, the <hi>Earth</hi> will Å¿ink at leaÅ¿t Three or Four large Inches.</p>
                           <p>This is a very neceÅ¿Å¿ary ObÅ¿ervation, to make in order to the keeping the <hi>Earth</hi> about them, higher than the Neighbouring Surface, and to avoid falling into the Inconveniency of having <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿unk too deep into the Ground.</p>
                           <p>For the SucceÅ¿s of Kernel <hi>Fruit,</hi> it matters but little whether the <hi>Graff</hi> be above or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground.</p>

                           <p>To have a reaÅ¿onable InÅ¿ight into the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary at leaÅ¿t to know the Time and CauÅ¿e, and eÅ¿pecially, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, the Manner.</p>
                           <p>As to the Time, it is always good to <hi>Prune</hi> from the Beginning of the Fall until the New Leaves grow again, and no <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> above once a Year.</p>
                           <p>Keeping within theÅ¿e Bounds, it will not be improper to Prune Weak <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿ooner, and thoÅ¿e that are Vigorous later.</p>
                           <p>As for the CauÅ¿e, there are two ReaÅ¿ons for <hi>Pruning;</hi> the firÅ¿t to diÅ¿poÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> to bear finer <hi>Fruit;</hi> and the Å¿econd to render them at all Times more pleaÅ¿ing to Å¿ight than they Å¿hould be, if they were not <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To attain the Effect of this Å¿econd Condition, muÅ¿t be by the means of the Figure, that is given to every <hi>Tree.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That Figure muÅ¿t differ according to the difference of the Ground <hi>Plats,</hi> and does not Extend beyond <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Wall Trees;</hi> for as for the generality <hi>high Standards</hi> are not Prun'd often.</p>
                           <p>The thick <hi>Branches</hi> only are capable of affording that Figure, which is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to be well underÅ¿tood, and muÅ¿t be had conÅ¿tantly in the Mind.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Dwarf,</hi> in order to be of a beautiful Figure, muÅ¿t have a low <hi>Stem,</hi> be open in the middle, and of a round Circumference, equally garniÅ¿h'd on the Sides: Of theÅ¿e four Conditions the moÅ¿t material is that which preÅ¿cribes the opening of the middle, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t Defect conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in a ConfuÅ¿ion of too much Wood in that very middle, which of all things muÅ¿t be avoided.</p>
                           <p>The Perfection of a <hi>Wall Tree</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in having its Å¿trength and <hi>Branches</hi> equally divided on the two OppoÅ¿ite Sides, in order to be equally furniÅ¿h'd throughout the whole Extent of it, whatever part the Head begins at, whether it has a low <hi>Stem,</hi> in which caÅ¿e it muÅ¿t begin within half a Foot from the Ground, or high, and then it begins from the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Stem,</hi> which is commonly about Six or Seven Foot.</p>
                           <p>The main thing in this depends on the DiÅ¿tinction which is to be made among the <hi>Branches,</hi> and the good uÅ¿e that is to be made of them; the <hi>Branches</hi> are either thick and Å¿trong, or Å¿lender and weak; every one of them furniÅ¿hing us with a ReaÅ¿on to take it away or preÅ¿erve it, to leave it long, or to <hi>prune</hi> it Å¿hort.</p>
                           <p>Among both, Å¿ome are good, and others ill, whether Thick or Slender.</p>
                           <p>The good are thoÅ¿e that grow according to the Order of Nature, and thoÅ¿e have thick or large <hi>Eyes,</hi> pretty cloÅ¿e to one another.</p>
                           <p>The ill ones on the contrary, are Å¿uch as grow againÅ¿t the Order of Nature, have flat Eyes, and at a great diÅ¿tance, for which ReaÅ¿on they are call'd <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>FalÅ¿e Wood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To underÅ¿tand that Order of Nature, you muÅ¿t know in the firÅ¿t Place, that the <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hould only Å¿hoot from thoÅ¿e that were cut Å¿horter at the laÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> and that all Å¿uch as Å¿hoot from other Parts are <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>FalÅ¿e Wood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, that according to the Order of New <hi>Branches,</hi> if there be more than one, that which Å¿hoots from the Extremity muÅ¿t be thicker and longer than that which grows immediately beneath it; and this thicker and longer than the third, and Å¿o of all the reÅ¿t; and conÅ¿equently when any of them prove thick where they Å¿hould be Å¿lender, it is a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>FalÅ¿e Wood.</hi> There are Å¿ome few Exceptions Å¿et down in the TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48210:30"/>
The good Å¿mall <hi>Branches,</hi> both as to Stone and Kernel-<hi>Fruit,</hi> are the bearing <hi>Branches;</hi> and the good Thick ones are for <hi>Wood;</hi> but quite contrary as to <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> and <hi>Vines.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As for the manner of <hi>Pruning</hi> it is generally look'd upon as much more difficult than really it is; the Principles, which are pretty eaÅ¿ie, being once underÅ¿tood, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the Operation, and yet it is the MaÅ¿ter-Piece of <hi>Gard'ning.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Chief Maxims are, FirÅ¿t, That Young <hi>Trees</hi> are much more eaÅ¿ie to <hi>Purne</hi> than old Ones, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e having been often Ill <hi>Prun'd,</hi> and not having the Figure they Å¿hould have: The beÅ¿t <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are very much put to it, to correct thoÅ¿e old Defects. I have given particular Rules for Å¿uch Inconveniencies.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That the Å¿trong <hi>Branohes</hi> muÅ¿t be cut Å¿hort, and commonly reduc'd to the length of Five, Six or Seven Inches; yet there are certain CaÅ¿es in which they muÅ¿t be kept longer; but thoÅ¿e are not common: I Å¿pecifie them in my great TreatiÅ¿e.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, That among the others, there are Å¿ome that may be kept Å¿horter, and others longer; that is, even to Eight, Nine and Ten Inches; nay, and to a Foot, a Foot and a half, and perhaps more, eÅ¿pecially in <hi>Peach, Plum,</hi> and <hi>Cherry Wall Trees,</hi> which muÅ¿t be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated accorded to their Strength and ThickneÅ¿s, to be capable of NouriÅ¿hing and Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without breaking Å¿uch <hi>Fruits</hi> as they Å¿hall be Burthen'd with.</p>
                           <p>Upon Vigorous well Proportion'd <hi>Trees,</hi> there can hardly be too many of thoÅ¿e we call <hi>Branches for Fruit,</hi> provided they cauÅ¿e no ConfuÅ¿ion: But as for the Thick ones, which we call <hi>Branches for Wood,</hi> for the Generality in all Å¿orts of <hi>Trees</hi> only one muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd, of all thoÅ¿e that have been produc'd by every <hi>Branch,</hi> having been <hi>Prun'd</hi> the preceding Year.</p>
                           <p>UnleÅ¿s the <hi>Trees,</hi> being very Vigorous, the Extremities of the new <hi>Branches</hi> chance to be very diÅ¿tant the one from the other, and looking towards different oppoÅ¿ite Parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare on the Å¿ides; which of neceÅ¿Å¿ity will require, being fill'd up for the perfecting of the Figure; in which CaÅ¿e we may leave Two, nay Three, provided they be all of different Lengths, and never form a forked Figure.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Fruit</hi> bearing <hi>Branches,</hi> periÅ¿h after having perform'd their Duty with this DiÅ¿tincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in Stone-<hi>Fruit</hi> they die at the End of one Year, or Two, or Three at moÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>And in Kernel-<hi>Fruit,</hi> not till after having Å¿erved Four or Five Years.</p>
                           <p>Therefore foreÅ¿ight is of great UÅ¿e, to think betimes of providing new <hi>Branches</hi> to fill up the Room of Å¿uch as we know are to die, in order to avoid growing too bare and barren.</p>
                           <p>ThoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruit Branches</hi> are good, whatever part of the <hi>Tree</hi> they Å¿hoot from, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inwards or Outwards.</p>
                           <p>But a Thick one is always Ill, when it Å¿hoots Inwards in a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be to cloÅ¿e Å¿uch as open too much, as it commonly happens in <hi>Butter Pear Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So that the Beauty of the <hi>Trees,</hi> and the Beauty and Abundance of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> depend chiefly upon good <hi>Pruning,</hi> the good Management of certain <hi>Branches</hi> that are at once Thick and Good, and the taking quite away of Å¿uch as are both Thick and Bad.</p>
                           <p>And whereas it happens Å¿ometimes, that a <hi>Branch</hi> having been left long the foregoing Year in order to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> receiving more NouriÅ¿hment than naturally it ought to have, grows thick, and Å¿hoots other thick ones. One of the material Points of <hi>Pruning</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ts not only in uÅ¿ing this <hi>Branch</hi> like other <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> but eÅ¿pecially in not leaving upon it any thick one grown on the Extremity of it, unleÅ¿s it be with a deÅ¿ign to let the <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hoot upwards, in order to make it a <hi>Standard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This good Conduct teaches for the Generality to lower <hi>Trees,</hi> I mean, that it is better in <hi>Pruning,</hi> wholly to take away the higheÅ¿t <hi>Branches</hi> that are thick, preÅ¿erving only the loweÅ¿t, than to do the contrary. Provided always, that the higheÅ¿t prove not better plac'd than the lower, to contribute towards the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which is not uÅ¿ual; for in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, the loweÅ¿t muÅ¿t be taken away, and the higheÅ¿t preÅ¿erv'd: The firÅ¿t deÅ¿ign in this is, to have fine <hi>Trees,</hi> it being moÅ¿t certain that the Abundance of fine <hi>Fruit</hi> never fails attending Å¿uch a DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of a fine Figure, Å¿ince none of the Å¿mall <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> are removed, but on the contrary are thereby multiplied, and afterwards freed from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might obÅ¿truct them.</p>
                           <p>The lowring of them, contracts into the <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿eated on the Extremity of that which has been cut down, all the <hi>Sap</hi> that would have gone into the Superior, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, that have been taken away; whereby the preÅ¿erv'd <hi>Branch</hi> grows much Å¿tronger, and conÅ¿equently capable of greater Production than it Å¿hould have been.</p>
                           <p>And whereas Å¿ometimes, contrary to the Order of Nature, weak <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hoot from the Extremity of the thick one, that had been Å¿hortned at the preceding <hi>Pruning;</hi> this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct teaches us to preÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e weak <hi>Branches,</hi> and to perform the <hi>Pruning</hi> upon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thick ones, which being underneath that, or thoÅ¿e weak ones, appears moÅ¿t proper for the perfecting of the Beauty of the Figure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48210:31"/>
BeÅ¿ides the <hi>Pruning</hi> we have now mention'd, we Å¿ometimes perform another Operation which we call <hi>Pinching</hi> or <hi>Breaking;</hi> which is commonly of more uÅ¿e for <hi>Peach Trees</hi> than any others, unleÅ¿s it be upon all Å¿orts of <hi>Graffs</hi> perform'd upon thick Vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> already placed in the <hi>Garden:</hi> The Effect of this <hi>Pinching</hi> is to hinder the <hi>Branches</hi> from growing too thick, and conÅ¿equently uÅ¿eleÅ¿s for <hi>Fruit,</hi> as alÅ¿o from growing too long, to hinder a <hi>Tree</hi> from Å¿hooting upwards too Å¿oon, or from being broken by high Winds.</p>
                           <p>The Effect of it, is likewiÅ¿e to produce many <hi>Branches</hi> inÅ¿tead of one, among which Å¿ome Å¿mall ones will be of uÅ¿e for <hi>Fruit,</hi> and Å¿ome thick ones for <hi>Wood:</hi> The uÅ¿e of it, or rather the time of uÅ¿ing it, is about <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and muÅ¿t be perform'd by breaking with the Nail that <hi>Branch,</hi> which being about half a Foot, or Å¿omewhat more in length, begins to appear too thick.</p>
                           <p>In Order to <hi>Pinch</hi> or break to the purpoÅ¿e, the thick <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be reduc'd to Three or Four <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds;</hi> and when the <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿o <hi>Pinch'd</hi> proves obÅ¿tinate in Å¿hooting thick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Å¿ame Operation of <hi>Pinching</hi> muÅ¿t be perform'd again, but a Weak <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t never be <hi>Pinch'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I will neither mention here the <hi>Pruning</hi> of Old <hi>Trees,</hi> nor of <hi>Vines,</hi> or <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> which I refer to the particular TreatiÅ¿es I have written upon each of them.</p>

                           <p>Care muÅ¿t be taken to <hi>PalliÅ¿ade</hi> or tack as often as the <hi>Branches</hi> appear long enough to be tack'd, which otherwiÅ¿e would be in danger of breaking.</p>

                        <p>And yet without rendring the thing almoÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿Å¿ible, and without minding a Å¿cruple that comes into my mind, that I can Å¿ay nothing here but what every Body knows as well as my Å¿elf, I am reÅ¿olv'd to treat of this BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s at large, being perÅ¿waded that it is one of the moÅ¿t EÅ¿Å¿ential of all thoÅ¿e that belong to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and indeed the very Soul of <hi>Gardens;</hi> for Å¿ince a perpetual <hi>Culture</hi> is the only way to render a <hi>Garden</hi> Delightful, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible ever to expect it Å¿o, unleÅ¿s it be in the hands of a Skilful Laborious <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>

                        <p>I Å¿hall begin with the good Qualifications of the OutÅ¿ide, of which the Eyes are the only and firÅ¿t Judges; for often at firÅ¿t Å¿ight we find our Å¿elves all of a Å¿udden inclined either to a good Liking and EÅ¿teem, or Scorn and AverÅ¿ion for the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> that offers himÅ¿elf.</p>

                        <p>ThoÅ¿e kind of MaÅ¿ters had never learn'd elÅ¿ewhere, nor imagin'd of themÅ¿elves the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of every part of their Work; Å¿o that not knowing it, and continuing to work for the moÅ¿t part by chance, or rather by rote, they have been no more capable of teaching it, than their Prentices of enquiring it; Å¿o that perhaps excepting Å¿ome Skill in <hi>graÅ¿Å¿ing</hi> and <hi>couching</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> in <hi>Tilling,</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> ordering of a <hi>Bed,</hi> Å¿owing and watering Å¿ome <hi>Seeds,</hi> clipping of <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>PalliÅ¿ados,</hi> which are all very eaÅ¿ie to do and learn, and may be learn'd by Boys Å¿eeing others do it; I Å¿ay, excepting Å¿uch kind of Works which are none of the moÅ¿t material, it may be affirm'd that they hardly know any thing, eÅ¿pecially as to the main part of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> which is the Conduct of all Å¿orts of <hi>Trees,</hi> the beauty and Å¿ingular goodneÅ¿s of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> their Maturity well underÅ¿tood, and an uninterrupted Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Novelties of every Month in the Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>This is in reality the common PrenticeÅ¿hip of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> or rather the Epidemical DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e of all <hi>Gardens;</hi> I am not ignorant that there are Å¿ome well meaning <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt would grow skilful, were they well InÅ¿tructed; thoÅ¿e deÅ¿erve Pity and AÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and therefore I never fail to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them in all I can.</p>
                        <p>I am alÅ¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible that there are Å¿ome, who either of themÅ¿elves, or having been brought up under a good MaÅ¿ter, have both Worth and Capacity, and afterwards are careful of making good Prentices; therefore it is good to have Å¿ome brought up by Å¿uch hands, and approv'd by their MaÅ¿ters.</p>
                        <p>However, though theÅ¿e Precautions might Å¿eem Å¿ufficient, I am Å¿till of Opinion, that before we ingage any farther, eÅ¿pecially, only wanting a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> for an ordinary <hi>Garden,</hi> it will not be amiÅ¿s to find out Å¿ome occaÅ¿ion to make the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> you have Å¿ome Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to chooÅ¿e, Å¿et his hands to Å¿ome laborious piece of Work, to Å¿ee how he goes about it; as to <hi>Till</hi> Å¿ome Å¿pot of <hi>Ground,</hi> to carry Å¿ome Watering-Pots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which Tryals it will be eaÅ¿ie to judge whether he has thoÅ¿e neceÅ¿Å¿ary Qualifications of Body; whether he acts naturally, or forces himÅ¿elf; if he be handy and laborious, or clumÅ¿ey and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: A man that is Å¿oon out of breath, does more than his Å¿trength can permit, and conÅ¿equently cannot make a good Workman, I mean, a laÅ¿ting one; Å¿uch a man is not fit for our turn, unleÅ¿s we barely want one to order and manage, which is not uÅ¿ual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> where Å¿uch a one is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary.</p>
                        <p>SuppoÅ¿ing we are hitherto Å¿atisfy'd with the AnÅ¿wers and Work of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who offers himÅ¿elf, there are Å¿till other very material Qualifications to be wiÅ¿h'd for, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd.</p>

To this I might add, that in many Countrey HouÅ¿es the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is made HouÅ¿e-keeper, when his Wife is ingenious and cleanly, which is always of great UÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to enquire the Names of the MaÅ¿ters under whom this <hi>Gard'ner</hi> has learn'd his <hi>Trade;</hi> when he cites for a good MaÅ¿ter, a Man of known Ignorance, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himÅ¿elf upon it, it is a Å¿ign of Incapacity, though in other things the Prentice may chance to know more than his MaÅ¿ter.</p>
                        <p>There are yet Å¿ome other Marks by which it may be eaÅ¿ie to judge of the Merit of <hi>Gard'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> for inÅ¿tance, I do not like a great Babler, who talks of nothing but his Skill, or affects hard Words, which he thinks are fine, though they really are not Å¿o.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I like him, who without being able to give a good reaÅ¿on for it, values himÅ¿elf upon equally deÅ¿piÅ¿ing what he has not Å¿een, as well as what he has Å¿een, who has Å¿o great <note place="margin">DiÅ¿truÅ¿t thoÅ¿e <hi>Gard'ners</hi> who boaÅ¿t of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are Ignorant of. <hi>Xenophon.</hi>
                           </note> an Opinion of his Ability, as to think that he can learn nothing new; who thinks he Å¿hould wrong himÅ¿elf in inquiring after, or hearkening to Men of Reputation; as if this Wretch thereby fear'd to bring his Knowledge in queÅ¿tion. There are but too many, who upon the QueÅ¿tions that are made to them, anÅ¿wer with a diÅ¿dainful Smile. It would be a fine thing if at my Age I did not know my <hi>Trade,</hi> and thereupon would not for any thing acknowledge their Faults, or be better inform'd.</p>
                        <p>There are Å¿ome who always affect to ruin whatever is Ancient in their <hi>Garden,</hi> and to make perpetual Novelties, and thoÅ¿e Å¿tudy to amuÅ¿e their MaÅ¿ters with Å¿ome hopes of the future, both to hinder him, in the mean time, from perceiving their Ignorance, for the time paÅ¿t or preÅ¿ent, as well as to make their Profit by the Expence incident to new Works.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, there are Å¿ome others, whoÅ¿e Stupidity is Å¿o great, that they never imagine any thing, and had rather leave the <hi>Gardens</hi> they undertake in the Å¿ame Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they find them, though never Å¿o much out of Order, than alter the leaÅ¿t thing about them; who having a great number of ugly <hi>Trees,</hi> quite decay'd, or Å¿quares of <hi>Strawberrys, Artichokes</hi> and <hi>Sparagus, &amp;c.</hi> no longer producing any thing fine or good, inÅ¿tead of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to remedy it, which is very eaÅ¿ie, will cry that it is enough for them to preÅ¿erve things as they find them.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e two Å¿orts of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are equally to be avoided; thoÅ¿e who are continually brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Skill in <hi>Graffing,</hi> thereby likewiÅ¿e give an infallible proof of their Incapacity as to what relates to the main part of <hi>Gard'ning;</hi> I am not ignorant that 'tis neceÅ¿Å¿ary to <hi>graff</hi> well, but at the Å¿ame time I know that a Woman, or a Child of eight or ten years of Age, may do it as well as the beÅ¿t <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> nothing has produc'd Å¿o many Block-heads in point of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> as that Skill in <hi>Graffing.</hi> It is the <hi>NuÅ¿Å¿eries</hi> that produce Å¿o many pittiful <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who have, as it were, corrupted and infected all that belongs to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> looking upon themÅ¿elves as being the greateÅ¿t MaÅ¿ters in that Art, as Å¿oon as they can <hi>Graff</hi> well, and in that belief undertake the Management of any <hi>Garden</hi> what ever.</p>
                        <p>There are yet another kind of Blockheads, who cannot Å¿peak Three Words of their own Trade, without intermixing the Full and Wainal-Moon. Pretending, and yet knowing no ReaÅ¿on for it, that it is an ObÅ¿ervation altogether neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the SucceÅ¿s of all that belongs to <hi>Gard'ning:</hi> They really Fancy they can perÅ¿wade us by Å¿uch Words, that they are acquainted with all the MyÅ¿teries of that Art; Å¿o that having Å¿aid with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umptuous HaughtineÅ¿s, in their Jargon, that every <hi>Friday</hi> bears a DecreaÅ¿e, and that <hi>Good-Friday</hi> is Infallible for <hi>Sowing</hi> and <hi>Graffing,</hi> for <hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>Pruning, &amp;c.</hi> They really think 'tis the greateÅ¿t HappineÅ¿s in the World, for any Body to have them for their <hi>Gard'ners.</hi>

I fully examine in my TreatiÅ¿e of Reflection what relates to thoÅ¿e ViÅ¿ions, which in point of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> I really look upon to be as Ridiculous as Old; therefore I always Å¿uÅ¿pect thoÅ¿e talkers of DecreaÅ¿e, who are Dumb upon the leaÅ¿t difficulty propos'd to them upon Å¿uch Maxims, their Å¿ole AnÅ¿wer being, that in this they follow an Opinion in Vogue all the World over.</p>
                        <p>I think I have been pretty Exact in the ObÅ¿ervation of the Good and Ill Qualifications, that are commonly met with among <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> now in my Opinion it will not be amiÅ¿s, eÅ¿pecially in Relation to thoÅ¿e who know but little, to enjoin them to Å¿tudy Carefully in order to improve themÅ¿elves.</p>
                        <p>As to thoÅ¿e who have Skill and Capacity, I conjure them with all my Heart to continue to perfect themÅ¿elves, thereby more and more to deÅ¿erve the Favour of their MaÅ¿ters, if good ones, if not, to deÅ¿erve better.</p>
                        <p>I find my Å¿elf very much inclin'd to oblige all thoÅ¿e who are deÅ¿irous to learn, either in aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting them with Å¿ome InÅ¿tructions in thoÅ¿e parts of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> they are not Å¿ufficiently acquainted with, or in Procuring them good Places, in conÅ¿iderable HouÅ¿es.</p>

                        <p>LaÅ¿tly, in order to eaÅ¿e the Mind of a MaÅ¿ter who wants a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> if he himÅ¿elf be <note place="margin">No <hi>Gard'ner</hi> can be good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s Skilful and Ignorance is the greateÅ¿t Defect he can poÅ¿Å¿ibly have. <hi>Zenophon.</hi>

                        <p>Not but that there are Å¿ome People who can work better than Talk, and Å¿ome who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have more Facility to expreÅ¿s themÅ¿elves than others; but in this CaÅ¿e, we look firÅ¿t for <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> not Orators; and in the Å¿econd Place expect no Eloquence, only Å¿ome marks of a NeceÅ¿Å¿ary Capacity, both to be Å¿atisfied that a <hi>Garden</hi> will always be in a good CaÅ¿e, it being in the Hands of a good <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and to hope for the Satisfaction of having Å¿ometimes the PleaÅ¿ure of diÅ¿courÅ¿ing about <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and to propoÅ¿e QueÅ¿tions upon the Matter occurring.

                     <p>I Am particularly to treat here of Four Things: The firÅ¿t relating to the Advantages to be wiÅ¿h'd for, in order to make <hi>Gardens:</hi> The Å¿econd relating to <hi>Earth,</hi> in reÅ¿pect to thoÅ¿e <hi>Gardens:</hi> The third, to what is proper to Correct the Defects we meet with in <hi>Gardens</hi> already made: The fourth, to the manner of <hi>Cultivating Gardens,</hi> together with Å¿uch Qualifications of <hi>Soil,</hi> as are proper for every particular Kind of <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will Å¿peak of what relates to the firÅ¿t Article, after having firÅ¿t declar'd that I am only to treat here of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> whether they be City <hi>Gardens,</hi> which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are but of a Moderate CompaÅ¿s: The Ground of conÅ¿iderable Cities being too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to employ much of it in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> or Country <hi>Gardens,</hi> which for the generality are pretty large, at leaÅ¿t much larger than thoÅ¿e of Cities, and that in proportion to the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the MaÅ¿ter, and StatelineÅ¿s of every HouÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>I am Å¿enÅ¿ible, that for the generality, both City and Country <hi>Gardens</hi> are made for the Conveniency of the HouÅ¿es, and therefore Å¿hould be pretty cloÅ¿e to them; yet conÅ¿idering that thoÅ¿e of the Country require a pretty large Extent, in order to yield conÅ¿iderably, being neceÅ¿Å¿ary for SuÅ¿tenance, as well as PleaÅ¿ure: In my Opinion, it were to be wiÅ¿h'd that the HouÅ¿es were built for the <hi>Gardens,</hi> and not the <hi>Gardens</hi> made for the HouÅ¿es. I mean, that one of the Chief ConÅ¿iderations in the Choice of the Situation of HouÅ¿es, Å¿hould be particularly to pitch upon a proper Place to make fine and good <hi>Gardens</hi> with EaÅ¿e, which however is but Å¿eldom minded. There are other more prevailing ConÅ¿iderations moÅ¿t People fix upon: For InÅ¿tance, a fine ProÅ¿pect, the Neighbourhood of a Wood or River, the Conveniency and PleaÅ¿ure of Hunting, the Facility of making Fountains or Canals, the Advantage of the Income, or Å¿ome other ConÅ¿ideration of the Adjacency of Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the <hi>Gardens</hi> in QueÅ¿tion are commonly the laÅ¿t Thing thought upon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48210:34"/>
and conÅ¿equently much more the Works of Nicety and After-thought, than of Choice or ForecaÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it is much more common to become MaÅ¿ter of a HouÅ¿e ready Built, either by PurchaÅ¿e or SucceÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to chuÅ¿e the Situation, and begin to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it; Å¿o that generally People are neceÅ¿Å¿itated to make Å¿uch <hi>Gardens</hi> as the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of their HouÅ¿es will allow, which is the ReaÅ¿on they are not commonly Å¿o good as they Å¿hould be.</p>
                     <p>But Å¿uppoÅ¿ing a Man were in a Condition to chuÅ¿e, I will take the Liberty to explain here what I think moÅ¿t proper to be done, to Å¿uceeed in the choice of a <hi>Garden</hi> for a HouÅ¿e, as I would willingly do as to the Choice of the Situation of that HouÅ¿e, were this a proper Place for it.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of <hi>Earth</hi> in General.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN Order to prove what <hi>Earth</hi> is, not taking in a PhiloÅ¿ophical or ChriÅ¿tian Sence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is underÅ¿tood the whole MaÅ¿s, this not being a queÅ¿tion proper to be decided in this Place: It is Å¿ufficient to know, <hi>Earth</hi> being conÅ¿idered in that Sence, that it is a great round MaÅ¿s, which forming one part of the created World, is Situated in the middle of the CeleÅ¿tial Sphere; where, by the Orders of the Creator, it Å¿uÅ¿tains it Å¿elf, as it were by its own Weight.</p>
                        <p>But to take <hi>Earth</hi> in the Sence of a good <hi>Husbandman,</hi> or a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> to be able to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what it is in relation to all the Å¿mall Particles that compoÅ¿e it, and the <hi>Culture</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the Hand of Man.</p>
                        <p>In that Sence, I think, I may Å¿ay, that <hi>Earth</hi> is a quantity of a certain kind of Å¿mall Sand, which by the Operation of a certain Salt, wherewith Nature has endued every Grain of that Sand, is proper for the Production of <hi>Vegetables;</hi> in order to which there muÅ¿t be Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Grains together, which receiving a temperate MoiÅ¿ture, form a compacted Body, which afterwards receiving Å¿ome degrees of moderate Heat, Å¿eems to compoÅ¿e an animated Body: So that without theÅ¿e two helps of MoiÅ¿ture and Heat, this <hi>Earth</hi> remains uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and as it were dead. 'Tis almoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame manner that <hi>Flower,</hi> which is an entire Body, compoÅ¿ed of an Infinite Number of Å¿mall Particles, all well Å¿eperated the one from the other; this <hi>Flower,</hi> I Å¿ay, being moiÅ¿tned to a certain degree, forms PaÅ¿te or Pap, either of which being Å¿eaÅ¿on'd with a little Salt, and afterwards heated to a certain degree, become proper for the NouriÅ¿hment of Man; whereas this <hi>Flower</hi> would remain uÅ¿eleÅ¿s or dead, if Water, Salt and Fire were not introduc'd to Animate it. However, we find this difference between <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Flower,</hi> that the laÅ¿t being once wetted, alters its nature to that degree, that it cannot return to its firÅ¿t Condition, although the MoiÅ¿ture be altogether drein'd out of it,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48210:35"/>
whereas on the contrary, <hi>Earth</hi> having once loÅ¿t the MoiÅ¿ture it had receiv'd, remains in the Å¿ame Condition it was before, when it receives a Å¿econd MoiÅ¿ture; but yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ought not to deÅ¿troy our CompariÅ¿on.</p>
                        <p>The ReaÅ¿on that induces me to Å¿ay that <hi>Earth</hi> is a kind of Sand, is, that in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, it really appears a Å¿andy Thing; I will not take upon me to explain what Sand is, Å¿ince I can Å¿ay nothing that is particular about it, nor new, I Å¿hall only Å¿ay in General, That there are Å¿everal kind of Sands, of which Å¿ome are very dry and barren, like thoÅ¿e of the Sea, Rivers, Sand Pits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others Fat and Fruitful, Å¿ome more, Å¿ome leÅ¿s: ThoÅ¿e that are FatteÅ¿t and moÅ¿t Fertile, make the beÅ¿t <hi>Earth;</hi> the others that are not Å¿o Fat, or have no FatneÅ¿s at all, make but ordinary or bad <hi>Earth,</hi> eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as are Light, Dry and Sandy: Moreover Å¿ome are Å¿ofter, which make Å¿oft eaÅ¿ie <hi>Soil</hi> or <hi>Mould;</hi> others courÅ¿er, which make a rough Loam, hard to be manag'd. In fine, Å¿ome are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous and Sticking together, of which thoÅ¿e that are but moderately Å¿o, make Å¿trong <hi>Earth;</hi> others that are more inclining to it, make clean Loamy <hi>Earth,</hi> and thoÅ¿e that are extreamly Unctuous, make clayiÅ¿h and heavy <hi>Earth,</hi> altogether unfit for <hi>Culture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides the difference of Sands, in Relation to FruitfulneÅ¿s and BarrenneÅ¿s, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which only differ as to Colour; for among <hi>Sands</hi> Å¿ome are BlackiÅ¿h, others ReddiÅ¿h; Å¿ome are White, Å¿ome Grey and others Yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence <hi>Earth</hi> derive the Names of Black, Red, White, Grey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But thoÅ¿e kind of Colours are not very EÅ¿Å¿ential to the goodneÅ¿s of <hi>Soil,</hi> as we Å¿hall demonÅ¿trate hereafter.</p>
                        <p>It is moÅ¿t certain, that thoÅ¿e Fertile Sands have really Å¿ome Qualities in themÅ¿elves, or rather a certain fruitful Salt, which is communicated to the Water that MoiÅ¿tens them, which being Å¿eaÅ¿on'd by theÅ¿e Qualities, muÅ¿t Å¿erve for the Production of <hi>Plants.</hi> JuÅ¿t in the Å¿ame Manner as <hi>SennÃ©, Rubarb</hi> and moÅ¿t <hi>Plants</hi> have in themÅ¿elves Medicinal Virtues and Properties, which communicate themÅ¿elves to the Water into which they are Infus'd, for the UÅ¿e of the Health of Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Truth is undeniable.</p>
                        <p>I might aÅ¿Å¿ert here in the firÅ¿t Place, that <hi>Earth</hi> (conÅ¿idering it in it Å¿elf as one of the Four Elements) has really no Original or Natural DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> being in its principal Qualities Cold and Dry, whereas <hi>Vegetation</hi> requires Heat and MoiÅ¿ture; but as by <note place="margin">Ãt vocavit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us aridam ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram. <hi>Gen. cap. 1. v.</hi> 11.</note> the ExpreÅ¿s Order and Command of Divine Providence, it finds it Å¿elf endu'd with a Salt neceÅ¿Å¿ary for Fertility, and is afterwards aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted both by the Rays of the Sun, and Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Fires which give it heat, as well as by Å¿ome Waters that moiÅ¿ten it, it Å¿eems to change its Nature; Å¿o that, in Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to Å¿o abÅ¿olute a Command of the Sovereign MaÅ¿ter, it appears as if it were a living animated Being, a Being, having its particular <note place="margin">Germinet terra herbam viren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp;c. <hi>Gen. cap. 1. v.</hi> 11.</note> Activity, that is, of Producing, as if in Effect <hi>Plants</hi> were no more in relation to it than the Teeth of an Animal are in relation to that Animal: I mean, that as it is the Animal that Lives, and not the Teeth; Å¿o it would be proper to Å¿ay, that the <hi>Earth</hi> lives, and not the <hi>Vegetables.</hi> This <hi>Earth,</hi> I Å¿ay, in Obedience to that Command, makes that vaÅ¿t number of different Productions we have Å¿o much ReaÅ¿on to admire.</p>
                        <p>I might Å¿ay, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there was a Å¿econd Command, after the CurÅ¿e occaÅ¿ion'd by <note place="margin">Spinas, &amp; tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los germinabit tibi, &amp;c. <hi>Gen. cap. 3. v.</hi> 18. In laboribus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes ex ea cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis diebus vitae tuae. <hi>Gen. cap. 3. v.</hi> 17.</note> the DiÅ¿obedience of Man, and that by Vertue of that Å¿econd Command, that <hi>Earth</hi> Å¿eems moÅ¿t Inclin'd to produce Ill <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Weeds;</hi> Å¿o that this very Man having for his PuniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment receiv'd a particular Order to <hi>Cultivate</hi> that <hi>Earth</hi> for his SubÅ¿iÅ¿tance, he finds himÅ¿elf in Å¿ome manner neceÅ¿Å¿itated to wage a perpetual War againÅ¿t it: He Labours and makes uÅ¿e of all his InduÅ¿try to VanquiÅ¿h and Overcome the malicious Inclination of that <hi>Earth,</hi> which on its part defends it Å¿elf with all its Might, to avoid, deceive and croÅ¿s the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Authority of that Å¿econd MaÅ¿ter.</p>
                        <p>And Å¿o we Å¿ee, that being no wiÅ¿e inclin'd to favour Children that are in Å¿ome manner <note place="margin">Sponte Å¿ua quae Å¿e tollunt in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis aur as, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faecunda qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, Å¿ed laeta, &amp; fortia Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt. <hi>Virg.

She relapÅ¿es as Å¿oon as Å¿he can, Å¿hooting vigorouÅ¿ly <hi>ThiÅ¿tles, Nettles,</hi> and a ThouÅ¿and other <hi>Plants</hi> of no UÅ¿e to us, which are properly her natural welbelov'd Children.</p>
                        <p>In this the <hi>Earth</hi> reÅ¿embles thoÅ¿e Children who are Å¿eldom tired with Voluntary Games and Sports, though never Å¿o Rough or Violent in themÅ¿elves, and yet appear Å¿oon weary in the performance of what a Superior Authority enjoins them for their good, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿o eaÅ¿ie in the Execution.</p>
                        <p>Thus then, this <hi>Earth</hi> is oblig'd to obey in a great many Things, which Man requires of it, in which perhaps it might be compar'd to a young Colt, Vigorous and ObÅ¿tinate, <note place="margin">Loquere terrae, &amp; reÅ¿pondebit tibi, &amp;c. <hi>Iob.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I might Å¿ay, that all Å¿ort of <hi>Soils</hi> are not proper for all Sorts of Productions, Å¿o that every <hi>Clime</hi> Å¿eems in Å¿ome Sence to be reduc'd to Å¿ome particular Thing, which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <note place="margin">Nec vero terrae ferre omnes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia poÅ¿Å¿unt. <hi>Virg.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48210:35"/>
Toil and Care: It is in this point that Man Å¿tands in need of InduÅ¿try, nay even of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinacy, finally to overcome the ReÅ¿iÅ¿tance he meets with Å¿ometimes, in the <hi>Culture</hi> of his Ground.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e happy or unfortunate SucceÅ¿Å¿es of <hi>Plants,</hi> in certain Places ought to inform us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿tratively, what kind of <hi>Earth</hi> is abÅ¿olutely fit for every Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for InÅ¿tance, the large <hi>Cherry Trees</hi> of the Vale of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and the fine <hi>Plum Trees</hi> of the Hills of <hi>Meudon, &amp;c.</hi> InÅ¿truct me what <hi>Soil</hi> is proper for <hi>Cherries,</hi> and what for <hi>Plums, &amp;c.</hi> leaÅ¿t I Å¿hould engage to the rearing of them in <hi>Soils</hi> of a different Temper, with Confidence and PreÅ¿umption of Å¿ucceeding without difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I might finally Å¿ay what is known by every Body, that Å¿ome <hi>Earths</hi> are much better than others in every <hi>Climate,</hi> nay even Å¿ometimes in a Å¿mall CompaÅ¿s of <hi>Ground,</hi> vulgarly term'd <hi>Veins of Earth:</hi> For InÅ¿tance, <hi>Wheat</hi> grows well in one Place, and yet cannot grow in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloÅ¿e by it, where the <hi>Ground</hi> is only fit for <hi>Rye,</hi> or other Å¿mall Corn. <hi>Wine</hi> proves good in one Place, and is not Å¿o in another, tho' cloÅ¿e by it. <hi>MuÅ¿cadine</hi> ripens perfectly well in Å¿ome, and in others neither acquires TaÅ¿te, FirmneÅ¿s, Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence it follows, that it is very difficult to give general and poÅ¿itive Rules for every <hi>Climate</hi> in general, conÅ¿idering the great Proximity or NearneÅ¿s of good <hi>Soil</hi> to bad.</p>
                        <p>So that we Å¿ay in reÅ¿pect to the Production of <hi>Earth</hi> in every <hi>Clime,</hi> that Å¿ome are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good, that is, very Fertile, as we have often cauÅ¿e to Å¿ay, in reÅ¿pect to the Å¿aid Production, that Å¿ome are very Bad, that is, very Barren: This difference proceeding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently from the Internal Qualifications of every <hi>Ground,</hi> Å¿ince it cannot be imputed to the <hi>Sun,</hi> which looks upon them all with the Å¿ame Eye; it may likewiÅ¿e proceed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther CauÅ¿e, which we will demonÅ¿trate hereafter: But, in fine, our <hi>Gardens</hi> abÅ¿olutely require <hi>Earth,</hi> therefore let us now examine what Conditions are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to that <hi>Earth,</hi> in order to make our <hi>Garden</hi> thrive.</p>

                              </p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>BeÅ¿ides this, the Nature of this <hi>Soil</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿uch, that it may eaÅ¿ily repair what has been Impair'd by Å¿ome Extraordinary Accident, <hi>viz.</hi> by a great Heat, or a great Cold; by a great Drought, or great MoiÅ¿ture; by a long NouriÅ¿hment of Å¿ome Foreign <hi>Plant, &amp;c.</hi> Å¿o as eaÅ¿ily and certainly to recover its former GoodneÅ¿s, if left in quiet, and, as it were, abandon'd to it Å¿elf; which Å¿uppoÅ¿es that the Accidents that had troubled it in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Productions ceaÅ¿ing, the goodneÅ¿s of its Nature, and particularly its happy Situation, are apparently the principal CauÅ¿es thereof; which is Å¿o true, as to that Situation, that Å¿uch a <hi>Soil</hi> being admirably good in Å¿uch a Place, will Å¿oon ceaÅ¿e to be Å¿o, if carried into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where it may not meet with the good Fortune of Å¿uch an advantageous Situation: Whereas, on the contrary, if Barren in Å¿ome Place, being TranÅ¿ported into another, where the Situation happens to be better, it will undoubtedly prove much better in its Production there.</p>

                           <p>The Example of thoÅ¿e Wines that taÅ¿te of the <hi>Soil,</hi> is a convincing Proof of this Truth, it being moÅ¿t certain that the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is prepar'd by the <hi>Roots,</hi> is only made by the Water, which Å¿oaking in the <hi>Ground</hi> where thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> are to Work, of neceÅ¿Å¿ity par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates to the TaÅ¿te and Qualities of that <hi>Soil,</hi> and Å¿till retains them, notwithÅ¿tanding its being turn'd into <hi>Sap.</hi>

                           <p>It is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be better inform'd than I am, with all the diÅ¿orders that attend Å¿uch Soils, and with all the Inconveniencies they cauÅ¿e in <hi>Culture;</hi> and therefore I think it will not be improper for me to make a Å¿hort Relation, by the by, of what I have been oblig'd to do in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>VerÅ¿ailles;</hi> of which the <hi>Earth</hi> is partly of the Nature of thoÅ¿e, which it were to be wiÅ¿h'd, might not be met with any where, and which we would not have there, had it been eaÅ¿ie to bring better in the room of it.

                           <p>This <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> is in a Place, where there was formerly a large and very deep Pond; we were oblig'd to fill up the Place of that Pond, and raiÅ¿e the Surface of it even above that of the Grounds about it, otherwiÅ¿e it being a MarÅ¿h, and the Å¿ink of the neighbouring Hills, it would never have Å¿ucceeded for the uÅ¿e it was deÅ¿ign'd to: we met with no great difficulty in the filling of it, by means of the Sands we were oblig'd to dig out to make the adjacent Canal, of which we us'd ten and twelve Foot in depth every where, but yet the difficulty of meeting with proper <hi>Mould</hi> to lay over thoÅ¿e Sands, and to have it Å¿peedily, together with the Expence and Time for the diÅ¿tant TranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the great quantity that was neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Å¿urface of near twenty five Acres, or Furlongs, were capable to diÅ¿courage any body from the EnterpriÅ¿e; therefore we were oblig'd to take that which lay neareÅ¿t to us, that is from the Mountain of <hi>Satory:</hi> I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it upon the Å¿pot, and found that it was a kind of loamy Ground which turn'd to Pap or Mortar, when after great Rains the Water remain'd long upon it, and look'd as if it had been petrify'd when it was dry; I likewiÅ¿e perceiv'd that common Showrs did not eaÅ¿ily Å¿oak into it, which troubled me much, but I imputed the cauÅ¿e of it to a kind of white Sand, or Å¿oft and chalkey Stone, which was found upon that Mountain at the Å¿econd Å¿pit deep of the Spade, and comforted my Å¿elf in hopes of meeting with a Remedy againÅ¿t it, by means of the Sands, upon which that <hi>Earth</hi> was to be plac'd; upon that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation I diÅ¿pos'd the ground of this <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> in Å¿uch a manner that the <hi>Earth</hi> of the Å¿urface might lay upon a level, without any declivity, as commonly moÅ¿t <hi>Gardens</hi> are; but I was extreamly Å¿urpriz'd when I found the contrary of what I expected; this <hi>Earth</hi> in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Place, did not change its Nature, it remain'd impenetrable to Water; that which happen'd moÅ¿t favourable to me in this, was, that I was expos'd the firÅ¿t year to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t miÅ¿chief that could poÅ¿Å¿ibly befall me, there falling Å¿uch great and frequent Showers of Rain, that the whole <hi>Garden</hi> Å¿eem'd to be turn'd into a Pond, or at leaÅ¿t into a puddled MarÅ¿h, which was inacceÅ¿Å¿ible, and above all, Mortal, both for the <hi>Trees</hi> that were root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and all the <hi>Kitchen Plants</hi> that were overflow'd by it: A Remedy was to be found Å¿uitable to Å¿o great an Inconvenience, otherwiÅ¿e the great work of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> the Expence of which had made Å¿o great a NoiÅ¿e, and the Figure whereof afforded Å¿o much PleaÅ¿ure, Å¿hould have been of no uÅ¿e: Happily in cauÅ¿ing this Å¿ame <hi>Garden</hi> to be made, I had at the Å¿ame time alÅ¿o made an <hi>Aqueduct</hi> that went a croÅ¿s it, in order to receive all the Waters of the Hills, which were wont to fall into that very Place to Å¿upply the former Pond, and were neceÅ¿Å¿ary to fill the great neighbouring Canal; therefore I bethought my Å¿elf to order Matters Å¿o, that thoÅ¿e Waters which were Å¿o pernicious to me, might loÅ¿e them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in that great <hi>Aqueduct,</hi> to which end I thought my Å¿elf oblig'd to raiÅ¿e every Plat or

Square into Ridges, which Remedy was good, but would have been violent, had I been forc'd to get new <hi>Earth</hi> for that Elevation; in order to perform this with more eaÅ¿e, I made uÅ¿e of long <hi>Dung,</hi> of which I was very well provided, as well to place it underneath, as to mix it with the <hi>Mould</hi> deÅ¿ign'd for <hi>Legumes,</hi> which anÅ¿wer'd my Expectation. The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿s prov'd good, and the Charge inconÅ¿iderable; in forming of this Work, I allow'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Square an imperceptible Declivity to lead or carry all the Waters Å¿liding down from all the parts Å¿o rais'd into one of the Corners; and caus'd a Å¿mall Stone Gutter to be made at every Corner, to carry thoÅ¿e Waters into the <hi>Aqueducts;</hi> and was not long before I found the benefit of that Invention; my Squares with their <hi>Plants,</hi> and my Borders with their <hi>Trees,</hi> being thereby preÅ¿erv'd according to my WiÅ¿h; beÅ¿ides, it contributed conÅ¿iderably towards the PreÅ¿ervation and good TaÅ¿te of all the things that I could rear there.</p>
                           <p>This manner of Ridges appear'd at firÅ¿t Å¿urprizing by its Novelty, but yet it had the good Fortune to pleaÅ¿e the King, whoÅ¿e Penetration and Judgment are infinite in all things; What Honour, and what Joy for me to have the Approbation of Å¿o great a Prince! He judg'd that the Invention was no leÅ¿s agreeable than new, Å¿o much the rather, becauÅ¿e it was of the greateÅ¿t uÅ¿e imaginable; beÅ¿ides, it added three Acres to the firÅ¿t Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Garden.</hi> I do not queÅ¿tion but this Method of Ridges will be imitated in all Places where the <hi>Earth</hi> Å¿hall be either like ours, or liable to the Inundation of great Rains, or naturally too MarÅ¿hy.</p>
                           <p>But when People have no Inclination to make Å¿uch Elevations, they muÅ¿t at leaÅ¿t reÅ¿olve to have recourÅ¿e to frequent <hi>Tillages,</hi> to avoid the Inconveniencies that attend Soils that eaÅ¿ily Chop in the time of great long heats, it being a very good and infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>FirÅ¿t</hi> is to remove as much of that <hi>Clear Sand</hi> as will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to form that depth of <hi>three Foot,</hi> filling it up afterwards with as good <hi>Mould</hi> as can be conveniently got.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48210:38"/>
The <hi>Second</hi> is to keep all thoÅ¿e Places that are to be <hi>Cultivated</hi> a little lower than the Walks, to the End that the Waters which falls into thoÅ¿e Walks, may altogether incline and run into that <hi>Ground.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and LaÅ¿t is to throw into thoÅ¿e <hi>Cultivated Plats,</hi> in the Winter, all the Snow that lies in the <hi>Walks,</hi> and other Parts, from which they may be eaÅ¿ily brought, which will make a ProviÅ¿ion of MoiÅ¿ture in the Bottom of that <hi>Ground,</hi> to help it to perform its Functions during the great Heats of Summer.</p>
                           <p>I have always us'd thoÅ¿e three Expedients, and have prevail'd with my Friends to put them in practice; and I atteÅ¿t with Truth, that we have all found a great Benefit by it, and that it is very Å¿afe to put them in practice.</p>
                           <p>No Body can be Ignorant, that when there lies Water at a moderate Depth within the <hi>Ground;</hi> for InÅ¿tance, about Three Foot deep (which is common at the Bottom of <hi>Vales,</hi> where there lies what we call a good <hi>Black Sand.)</hi> No Body, I Å¿ay, can be Ignorant, that in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e a Natural <hi>Philtration</hi> or <hi>DiÅ¿tillation,</hi> forms it Å¿elf in the Depth of that <hi>Earth,</hi> which raiÅ¿es part of that Water up to the <hi>Surface,</hi> which preÅ¿erving or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Earth</hi> in a good Temperature for <hi>Production,</hi> makes it extraordinary good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the Contrary, that Water lying in a great quantity too near the Surface; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, within a Foot or Å¿omewhat more, being Å¿top'd there by Å¿ome Bank of Å¿oft <hi>Chalk, Stone,</hi> or Å¿tiff <hi>Clay</hi> remains there, being hindred from deÅ¿cending lower, and thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions too great a MoiÅ¿ture in the <hi>Earth;</hi> Å¿o that unleÅ¿s a DiÅ¿charge be made of thoÅ¿e Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Waters, or that the <hi>Ground</hi> be rais'd <hi>RidgewiÅ¿e,</hi> as I have heretofore Explain'd, in order to make thoÅ¿e Waters riÅ¿e, Å¿uch <hi>Soil</hi> will of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity grow Cold, Rotten; and, in a Word, Å¿tark Nought.</p>
                           <p>And, indeed, we may aÅ¿Å¿ure our Å¿elves, that the MoiÅ¿ture of <hi>Soils</hi> often proceeds from that CauÅ¿e, as well thoÅ¿e that are very ExceÅ¿Å¿ive as thoÅ¿e that are not: That MoiÅ¿ture proceeds Å¿ometimes from other CauÅ¿es, as we Å¿hall declare in the Sequel.</p>

                           <p>There are Å¿ome <hi>Soils</hi> of Å¿o equal a Temperature, and Å¿o advantageous a ConÅ¿titution, that all manner of <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> of any kind whatever Å¿ucceed incomparably well in them; nay, which is more, thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Soils</hi> receiving but a common <hi>Culture</hi> of ordinary Labour, or Å¿tirring of the <hi>Ground</hi> for <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> preÅ¿erve themÅ¿elves good for many Years, without the AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of any Amendments, unleÅ¿s it be for <hi>Legumes.</hi>

                           <p>I add, that according to the greater or leÅ¿Å¿er quantity of Salt, every particular <hi>Plant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, all <hi>Plants</hi> not conÅ¿uming an equal quantity of it, that <hi>Earth</hi> which is abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided therewith, Å¿hoots, without wearing out Å¿o Å¿oon, Å¿everal different kind of <hi>Plants,</hi> and Å¿ometimes all of them together and at the Å¿ame time, witneÅ¿s the good <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Meadows,</hi> every part of which abounds with an Infinity of different <hi>Plants,</hi> all equally Vigorous: Sometimes, and that only when the <hi>Ground</hi> is indifferently good, that <hi>Earth</hi> only produces many Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively the one after the other; as we Å¿ee by Å¿mall <hi>Corn,</hi> as <hi>Barly, Oates, &amp;c.</hi> which are Å¿own in thoÅ¿e very <hi>Grounds</hi> that have juÅ¿t before produced <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Rye;</hi> which, though not capable of producing Å¿ome of the like Å¿o Å¿oon after it, have yet the Force of producing Å¿maller.</p>

Thus PhiloÅ¿ophers impute to the Air an ElaÅ¿tic Force, and to uÅ¿e a more Å¿enÅ¿ible Example. Thus Water has in it Å¿elf a kind of Natural CoolneÅ¿s with a Principle of re-eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing, and reproducing that CoolneÅ¿s, when after its having been heated by Fire, or by the Sun, it is remov'd out of their Reach: Heat is certainly a Å¿tranger to it, and, as it were, an Enemy; Å¿o that it keeps this Water in a violent Motion; But when 'tis remov'd from that which caus'd and maintain'd that Heat, and thereby left at ReÅ¿t, it deÅ¿troys that which render'd it defective, and by degrees becomes cool again as before; that is, it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the perfection, which is natural to its Being and Temper.</p>

We have a particular value for it, and indeed cannot have too much, Å¿ince it is certain that this <hi>New Soil</hi> poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es not only all the firÅ¿t Salt, which was given it at the Moment of the Creation; but alÅ¿o the Major Part of the Salt of the Surface, which was preÅ¿s'd down to the Bottom by Rains and Waterings, the Weight of which made it deÅ¿cend where-ever it could penetrate. This <hi>Salt</hi> preÅ¿erves it Å¿elf in thoÅ¿e hidden <hi>Earths,</hi> until they become a <hi>Surface</hi> themÅ¿elves, and then the Air gives them a proper diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to employ with Glory that Fertility wherewith they are Endu'd; and indeed they are no Å¿ooner at Liberty to Act, but they produce <hi>Vegetables</hi> of a Å¿urpriÅ¿ing Beauty.</p>
                           <p>It is not difficult to apprehend what <hi>New Mould</hi> is, all <hi>Earths</hi> were Å¿o Originally, that is, at the Moment of their Creation, God by his Command having beÅ¿tow'd upon them the Gift of the Faculty of <hi>Production,</hi> which till then had not been put in UÅ¿e. From that time none of the <hi>Earth</hi> of the Surface of that TerreÅ¿trial Body or MaÅ¿s, can be called <hi>New,</hi> Å¿ince all thoÅ¿e that were capable of Producing, have not ceas'd to Act hitherto: But whereas there are many Places, where the Bottom of that <hi>Earth,</hi> within Two or Three Foot of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, has always remain'd without Action, and others where that very Surface has not been allowed to Act, both the one and the other afford us <hi>New Earth,</hi> to make uÅ¿e of in our NeceÅ¿Å¿ities: So that by <hi>New Earth</hi> we mean Å¿uch as never Å¿erv'd towards the NouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any <hi>Plant.</hi> For InÅ¿tance, Å¿uch as lies Three Foot beneath the Surface, and from thence as low as it can go, provided it be really <hi>Earth,</hi> or elÅ¿e we mean Å¿uch as having already nouriÅ¿h'd Å¿everal <hi>Plants,</hi> has afterwards been long without nouriÅ¿hing any others; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Å¿uch as has been built upon. We Å¿ay, and that by Experience, that in the firÅ¿t Year, both the one and the other of theÅ¿e <hi>Earths</hi> are wonderfully good, eÅ¿pecially for our <hi>Gardens,</hi> all manner of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Legumes</hi> Improving, Growing and Thickning viÅ¿ibly in them: And when we plant <hi>Trees</hi> in them, provided they be good in themÅ¿elves, and be well planted, few of them MiÅ¿carry; whereas in thoÅ¿e that are naught, or really worn out, the greateÅ¿t part of them Die, though never Å¿o well condition'd, or Å¿o carefully planted.</p>
                           <p>The Eyes are not capable to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h whether <hi>Earth</hi> be new or worn out, that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muÅ¿t proceed from other Things, the one and the other being extreamly alike; and it might be Å¿aid with ReaÅ¿on, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Earths</hi> that are bad, whether they have always been Å¿o, or are grown Å¿o, are not unlike Gun-Powder, which being bad, or having taken Vent, cannot take Fire, and yet looks altogether like that which is good. Thus <hi>Earth,</hi> that is naturally naught and barren, or having been good is worn out, not having any thing within it to animate it, when it receives heat and moiÅ¿ture, remains as if it were dead, notwithÅ¿tanding a Succours which would animate any other <hi>Earth;</hi> Å¿o that not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing in the leaÅ¿t to the Action of the old <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> they at laÅ¿t rot, and together with them the whole Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> as I have fully Explain'd in my Reflections upon the Beginning of <hi>Vegetation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From whence it follows, firÅ¿t, That it is pleaÅ¿ant to make new Plantations, and that in good new <hi>Earth;</hi> and in the Å¿econd Place, that all thoÅ¿e who make new <hi>Gardens,</hi> ought certainly to be careful of preparing a kind of Magazine of it, in order to have it with EaÅ¿e and Convenience, whenever they Å¿tand in need of replanting new <hi>Trees,</hi> which happens pretty often. The Space of the Alleys, or at leaÅ¿t of part of them is very fit for thoÅ¿e kind of ProviÅ¿ions to which uÅ¿e I Employ them, inÅ¿tead of doing what moÅ¿t People do; that is, to fill them with Gravel and Dirt, taken out of the Plats, or Squares and Trenches.

                              <p>Of the Colour of good <hi>Earth.</hi>

                           </argument>
                           <p>I have declar'd Å¿everal Times already, That the moÅ¿t eÅ¿Å¿ential and Å¿ureÅ¿t Mark of the goodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Ground,</hi> is that which is taken from the Natural Beauty of its Productions; Å¿ome would willingly beÅ¿ides this, Å¿ettle another certain mark upon the Colour of it, and Å¿ay, that a blackiÅ¿h Grey is a convincing Proof in that matter, beÅ¿ides its being moÅ¿t plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing to the Eye.</p>
                           <p>This QueÅ¿tion has not only been debated in our Days; the great Authors of Antiquity <note place="margin">Nigra fere &amp; preÅ¿Å¿o pinguis Å¿ub vomere ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> have made Å¿ome Reflections upon it before us; for my part I am not in the leaÅ¿t prejudic'd in this Point, having Å¿een good and bad <hi>Earth</hi> of all Colours: But yet it is certain that this blackiÅ¿h Grey, which pleaÅ¿es moÅ¿t, and has deÅ¿erv'd the Approbation of former Ages, is commonly in that reÅ¿pect one of the beÅ¿t Signs of goodneÅ¿s, though not Infallible. We often meet with RediÅ¿h and WhitiÅ¿h <hi>Earth</hi> that are Incomparable, but Å¿eldom any that is quite White deÅ¿erving that Character. We likewiÅ¿e meet with Å¿ome that is Black, either at the Top of Å¿ome Hills, or in certain Vales, which are very barren; it being a kind of dead Sand, which can at moÅ¿t only produce Broom and Furrs.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we muÅ¿t conclude, that the true mark to judge of the GoodneÅ¿s of <hi>Mould,</hi> is neither the Colour nor Depth of it; Å¿ince nothing but the fine Production it naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords can do it, they only can decide in that Point. For InÅ¿tance, in the open Fields we may judge by the goodneÅ¿s of the GraÅ¿s, which Cattle willingly feeds on; by the <hi>Brambles, Briers, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> by the Size of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> large <hi>Lettuces</hi> and <hi>Sorrel, &amp;c.</hi> But more eÅ¿pecially, as has been Å¿aid already by the Vigour of the <hi>Trees,</hi> their long <hi>Shoots,</hi> the large Size and flouriÅ¿hing Verdure of the <hi>Leaves, &amp;c.</hi> TheÅ¿e marks we may look upon as undeniable Proofs and WitneÅ¿Å¿es, upon whoÅ¿e DepoÅ¿ition we may abÅ¿olutely rely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truÅ¿ting to any other. The Size of <hi>Fruits</hi> may be look'd upon as Å¿omething in that CaÅ¿e, but is no Infallible Argument, Å¿ince we commonly Å¿ee large <hi>Fruit</hi> upon weak <hi>Trees</hi> and Å¿ome very Å¿mall upon others that are more Vigorous. I Explain the ReaÅ¿ons of Å¿o great a difference in another Place.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>AFTER having Å¿ufficiently Explain'd what relates to the particular CaÅ¿e of <hi>Earth,</hi> I now proceed to the other Conditions that are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Perfection of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen Gardens,</hi> of which the Å¿econd in my Opinion is the Situation.</p>
                        <p>There is a diÅ¿tinction to be made, <hi>viz.</hi> whether in relation to a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of <hi>Fruit,</hi> excepting Å¿uch as are Red, as <hi>Strawberries, RaÅ¿pberries, Cherries, Currans,</hi> which compoÅ¿e part of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> or only to <hi>Fruit-Gardens</hi> without any <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumes;</hi> it happens Å¿ometimes that the <hi>Fruit-Garden</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> are made aÅ¿under; or, in fine, this <hi>Garden</hi> being compos'd both of the one and the other.</p>
                        <p>In the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, which relates to a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> without doubt little Valleys or Dales are to be preferr'd to all other Situations, and commonly have all that is to be deÅ¿ir'd in a good Ground; they are fit for Excellent <hi>Meadows,</hi> the <hi>Moulds</hi> is eaÅ¿ie and apparently of a Å¿ufficient depth, it is fatten'd with all that is good upon the Neighbouring Hills. Fine <hi>Legumes</hi> grow in it with EaÅ¿e and Plenty. Red <hi>Fruit</hi> acquire in it that SweetneÅ¿s and Size which renders them recommendable: Waterings are eaÅ¿ie at hand, Springs and Brooks being Å¿eldom wanting there; but then they are liable to a great Inconvenience, by Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When that Misfortune happens, few of thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> eÅ¿cape which ought to laÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Year in the <hi>Ground.

by being long overflow'd; and thus all the Advantages that are promis'd by a good Dale, are infinitely overbalanc'd by the DeÅ¿olation wherewith it is threatn'd.</p>
                        <p>In the Second CaÅ¿e, which relates to the having of good <hi>Fruits</hi> and betimes, certainly your elevated moderate Dry <hi>Grounds</hi> are the beÅ¿t, provided always the <hi>Ground</hi> be good in it Å¿elf, and deep enough; The Choice <hi>Fruits</hi> do not perhaps grow Å¿o large there, but that is Å¿ufficiently recompens'd by the Beauty of the Colour, the GoodneÅ¿s of the TaÅ¿te, and the ForwardneÅ¿s of the Maturity. What Difference is there between the <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Grapes</hi> that grow in thoÅ¿e Dry Situations, and thoÅ¿e that grow in moiÅ¿t Valleys: And indeed, <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Grapes</hi> are the true TouchÅ¿tone directing us to judge of the good or ill Situation of a <hi>Garden;</hi> how delicious are your <hi>Winter-Thorns, Burgamots, LanÅ¿ac, Petitoms</hi> and <hi>LouiÅ¿es-bonnes, &amp;c.</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an Elevated <hi>Ground,</hi> compar'd to the Å¿ame kind of <hi>Pears</hi> growing in a <hi>Meadow-Ground.</hi> ThoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> are another convincing Proof of the Importance of the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>Fruit-Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But laÅ¿tly, if in Relation to thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Gardens,</hi> that are coveted by moÅ¿t People, I <note place="margin">The uÅ¿ual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing Grounds.</note> mean <hi>Gardens</hi> compos'd both of <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes,</hi> the Choice is eaÅ¿ily made.

                        <p>IT is not enough for a <hi>Garden</hi> to have a good <hi>Ground,</hi> and to be well Å¿ituated, it muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be well expos'd; and a Å¿mall riÅ¿ing not being well expos'd, cannot be call'd an advantagious <hi>Situation.</hi> There are four Å¿orts of ExpoÅ¿itions, the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> the <hi>South,</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> all eaÅ¿ily known by the Names that have been given them, with this difference, that among <hi>Gard'ners</hi> theÅ¿e Terms Å¿ignifie the clean contrary of what they do among <hi>AÅ¿trologers</hi> and <hi>Geographers;</hi> theÅ¿e only regarding thoÅ¿e Parts, where the <hi>Sun</hi> actually appears, and not thoÅ¿e which are lighten'd by his <hi>Beams;</hi> for InÅ¿tance, by <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> they mean that part where the <hi>Sun</hi> RiÅ¿es, by <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> the part where it Sets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> only conÅ¿ider thoÅ¿e parts of their <hi>Garden</hi> upon which the <hi>Sun</hi> directly Å¿hines, and in what manner it Å¿hines upon it throughout the courÅ¿e of the day, either in relation to the whole <hi>Garden,</hi> or only in relation to Å¿ome of the Å¿ides of it; for Example, as to the Å¿ides, when the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Å¿ee the <hi>Sun</hi> at his RiÅ¿ing, and during all the firÅ¿t half of the day continue to Å¿hine upon one Å¿ide, they call that Å¿ide the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> and indeed it is really the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> of <hi>Gardens;</hi> Å¿o that when the <hi>Sun</hi> begins to appear later upon it, or to remove Å¿ooner from it, it can no longer be call'd <hi>EaÅ¿t;</hi> and by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on they call that Å¿ide the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> upon which the <hi>Sun</hi> Å¿hines all the Å¿econd half part of the day, that is from Noon till Night, and according to the Å¿ame way of Å¿peaking, they call that part <hi>South,</hi> where the <hi>Sun</hi> Å¿hines from above nine in the Morning till Evening, or elÅ¿e that part where it Å¿hines longeÅ¿t in the whole day, whatever hour it begins at, or removes from it; in fine, they call that <hi>North</hi> which is oppoÅ¿ite to the <hi>South,</hi> and conÅ¿equently that part which is leaÅ¿t favour'd by the Rays of the <hi>Sun;</hi> for perhaps it does not receive the benefit of it above one hour or two

                        <p>Although it may be urg'd, that whatever Situation a <hi>Garden</hi> be in, it has of neceÅ¿Å¿ity all the AÅ¿pects of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and conÅ¿equently is in a Condition to enjoy the Favors of all the ExpoÅ¿itions, as well as to fear the InÅ¿ults of all the Winds, yet every body agrees, that Å¿ome are better expos'd than others; which is particularly underÅ¿tood of Å¿uch as are upon Hills, or the Å¿ides of Mountains, of which Å¿ome have the RiÅ¿ing <hi>Sun,</hi> others the Setting; Å¿ome lye <hi>South,</hi> and others <hi>North;</hi> for as to the <hi>Gardens</hi> that are Å¿ituated in Plains, and are neither cover'd by Mountains, or high Woods, or lofty Buildings, the difference of thoÅ¿e ExpoÅ¿ures is not Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible.</p>
                        <p>The uÅ¿ual manner of Å¿peaking to expreÅ¿s the ExpoÅ¿itions in reÅ¿pect of every <hi>Garden,</hi> in the whole, and without any particular diÅ¿tinction of Å¿ides, muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood in relation to the ExpoÅ¿itions of the whole coaÅ¿t where thoÅ¿e <hi>Gardens</hi> are Å¿ituated; as the manner of Å¿peaking of the ExpoÅ¿ures of Walls in particular, relates to the manner of the <hi>Suns</hi> Å¿hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon every one of them in the courÅ¿e of the whole day; and Å¿o for Example, when in Å¿peaking of a <hi>Garden</hi> Å¿ituated upon a Å¿mall Hill, we Å¿ay that it lyes to the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> we mean that the <hi>Sun</hi> Å¿hines upon it as Å¿oon as it RiÅ¿es, and Å¿hines but little upon it in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: and when we Å¿ay that a <hi>Garden</hi> lyes full <hi>South,</hi> it is when the <hi>Sun</hi> Å¿hines upon it all the day, or at leaÅ¿t from Nine or Ten in the Morning till the Evening; and by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on when we Å¿ay that Å¿uch a <hi>Garden</hi> lyes to the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> we mean that the <hi>Sun</hi> does not begin to Å¿hine upon it till about Noon, and remains there till it Å¿ets.</p>
                        <p>Now the meaning of ExpoÅ¿itions is fully underÅ¿tood, in order to decide which is the beÅ¿t of the four, either in general for the whole <hi>Garden,</hi> or in particular for every one of the Å¿ides; it will be fit to know in the firÅ¿t place, that thoÅ¿e of the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> are by the Opinion of all <hi>Gard'ners</hi> the two chief, and therefore to be preferr'd before the two others; it is likewiÅ¿e fit to know that the ExpoÅ¿ition of the <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> is not amiÅ¿s, or at leaÅ¿t much better than the <hi>North,</hi> which conÅ¿equently is the worÅ¿t of all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> In order to decide between the two firÅ¿t, which is the beÅ¿t, the temper of the <hi>Earth</hi> muÅ¿t firÅ¿t be diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h'd; for if it be Å¿trong, and conÅ¿equently cold, the <hi>South</hi> is beÅ¿t; but if light, and conÅ¿equently hot, that of the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> will be moÅ¿t favourable.</p>
                        <p>The ExpoÅ¿ures of the <hi>South</hi> in all <hi>Earths</hi> is commonly proper to Å¿ecure all <hi>Plants</hi> againÅ¿t the rigors of the Winter, to give a taÅ¿te to the <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and to forward all that is to be early in all <hi>SeaÅ¿ons;</hi> and therefore Å¿ince it is favourable to all Å¿orts of <hi>Earth,</hi> it muÅ¿t be Å¿o particularly to a Å¿trong cold <hi>Earth,</hi> which can hardly act unleÅ¿s animated by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heat from the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is the moÅ¿t proper ExpoÅ¿ition for it: but not for light <hi>Earths,</hi> eÅ¿pecially in hot <hi>Climats,</hi> it being apt to Å¿corch the <hi>Plants</hi> in <hi>Summer</hi> to that degree, that the <hi>Kitchen Gardens</hi> become of no uÅ¿e, it engenders a thouÅ¿and <hi>Emots</hi> or kind of <hi>Fleas</hi> which gnaw and wrinkle the <hi>Leaves,</hi> it hinders the <hi>Fruits</hi> from growing to that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s they Å¿hould do, and thereby leÅ¿Å¿ens the goodneÅ¿s of the <hi>TaÅ¿te,</hi> and even often makes them drop before their time, which happens Å¿ometimes by reaÅ¿on that it Å¿poils or drys up the <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> nay even the Å¿talks of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> as we often Å¿ee it in <hi>MuÅ¿ctts</hi> and <hi>Peaches;</hi> and Å¿ometimes alÅ¿o in over-hard'ning the <hi>Rine</hi> of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> even to that degree that it often Å¿corches and chaps them; by which means abundance of <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Figs</hi> growing againÅ¿t Walls periÅ¿h through exceÅ¿Å¿ive heats: therefore it is eaÅ¿ie to decide the choice of thoÅ¿e two ExpoÅ¿itions, in reÅ¿pect to the difference of <hi>Earth;</hi> the <hi>South</hi> is moÅ¿t deÅ¿irable in cold moiÅ¿t parts, but not Å¿o much in dry Å¿andy <hi>Grounds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Generally Å¿peaking, this ExpoÅ¿ition of the <hi>South</hi> is free from the <hi>Northern</hi> Winds, which by their uÅ¿ual coldneÅ¿s are always cruel and fatal to all manner of <hi>Gardens,</hi> which is the reaÅ¿on it is generally choÅ¿en before that of the <hi>EaÅ¿t;</hi> but yet it is moÅ¿t certain that in light <hi>Grounds,</hi> the laÅ¿t being favour'd by Night Dews, and the firÅ¿t gentle and mild Rays of the <hi>RiÅ¿ing Sun,</hi> is incomparable for Maturity, Size and TaÅ¿te, as well as for the PreÅ¿ervation of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Legumes, &amp;c.</hi> and eÅ¿pecially becauÅ¿e over and above all this, it defends us from the <hi>North WeÅ¿t</hi> Winds; that Wind riÅ¿es between the <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> and as it regularly blows in the Spring, it is commonly attended by white <hi>FroÅ¿ts,</hi> which are very deÅ¿tructive to the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> whereon it lights, which is the reaÅ¿on that People ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ily
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48210:41"/>
bear with that <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ition even in Å¿trong <hi>Earths,</hi> but Å¿till I do certainly believe it beÅ¿t for light <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although I have preferr'd the ExpoÅ¿ition of the <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> before that of the <hi>North</hi> without any heÅ¿itation, the laÅ¿t being certainly the worÅ¿t of the two; yet in thoÅ¿e <hi>Climats</hi> where the heat being exceÅ¿Å¿ive, burns, and abÅ¿olutely ruins all that is too long expos'd to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>North</hi> ought to be choÅ¿en before the other; Å¿ince our <hi>Gardens</hi> only want a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat to nouriÅ¿h gentle what they produce, eÅ¿pecially to conduct <hi>Fruits</hi> to a perfect <hi>Maturity,</hi> and therefore in thoÅ¿e <hi>Climats</hi> where the <hi>Sun</hi> Å¿eems too violent, I Å¿hould rather affect a <hi>Northern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ition, having but four or five hours of <hi>RiÅ¿ing Sun,</hi> and as much of the <hi>Setting</hi> as any other, whether that which Å¿corches it all the Day, or that which Å¿hines upon it but half the Day: And certainly thoÅ¿e kind of hot <hi>Climats</hi> are not in the leaÅ¿t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on the <hi>South</hi> Walls for any of our kernel, or Å¿tone <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are too tender for it, they are only proper for <hi>Orange Trees, Citron Trees, Pomegranets, Figs,</hi> and <hi>MuÅ¿cats Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> of which the greateÅ¿t part of the <hi>Leaves</hi> muÅ¿t be kept upon the <hi>Trees;</hi> the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions will be good enough, for thoÅ¿e tender <hi>Fruits</hi> which cannot bear that of the <hi>South.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After having examin'd the Advantages that may be expected from good ExpoÅ¿itions, let us now conÅ¿ider the Inconveniences that may be fear'd from them; but whereas they are not infallibly attended with them, we muÅ¿t indeed be prepar'd to bear them, but not diÅ¿comforted when they happen, Å¿eeing the impoÅ¿Å¿ibility of a Remedy.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Southern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ition generally Å¿peaking is Å¿ubject to great Winds from the middle of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> to the middle of <hi>October,</hi> which often blow down the <hi>Fruit,</hi> Å¿ome before their being ripe and full grown, and others after their being ripe, which are quite bruis'd by the fall; and thus the beÅ¿t part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> periÅ¿hes, inÅ¿tead of performing its duty, which is to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h and recompence the MaÅ¿ter of the <hi>Garden;</hi> for which reaÅ¿on, in Å¿uch <hi>Gardens</hi> directly expos'd to the <hi>Southern</hi> Winds, which otherwiÅ¿e enjoy the Advantages that are Å¿o much valu'd in <hi>Gard'ning, Wall Trees</hi> are moÅ¿t proper; <hi>Dwarfs</hi> alÅ¿o defend themÅ¿elves pretty well, but <hi>Standards</hi> are to be pitty'd, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch whoÅ¿e <hi>Fruit</hi> does not Å¿tick faÅ¿t to the Stalk, for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Virgoules, Vertelongues,</hi> the St. <hi>Germains, &amp;c.</hi> which are not Å¿o proper for thoÅ¿e ExpoÅ¿ures, as thoÅ¿e that have the power to reÅ¿iÅ¿t better the violence of the Winds; for Example, the <hi>Thorn Pears,</hi> the <hi>Ambrets</hi> and <hi>LiÅ¿chalÅ¿erie,</hi> the <hi>dry Martins, &amp;c.</hi> or elÅ¿e Å¿tick to the Summer <hi>Fruits</hi> which are good at the time of their fall, as the <hi>Lady Thighs,</hi> the Å¿mall <hi>MuÅ¿cat Pears,</hi> the <hi>Blanquets,</hi> or whole <hi>Pears,</hi> the <hi>Robins,</hi> the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets</hi> or <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿etings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ure, though otherwiÅ¿e incomparable, has its Imperfections too Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; In the <hi>Spring</hi> it is Å¿ubject to <hi>North EaÅ¿t</hi> Winds, which are dry, cold Winds that wither the <hi>Leaves</hi> and new <hi>Shoots,</hi> eÅ¿pecially of <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> they likewiÅ¿e often blow down abundance of <hi>Kernel</hi> and <hi>Å¿tone Fruit,</hi> and particularly young <hi>Figs,</hi> at the time that by a reaÅ¿onable Å¿ize they began to give great hopes of plenty; thoÅ¿e Winds are not the only Enemies to that ExpoÅ¿ition, that which likewiÅ¿e is fatal to it, eÅ¿pecially for the <hi>EaÅ¿tern Wall Trees,</hi> is the not enjoying the benefit of <hi>Rains,</hi> which Å¿eldom coming but from the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> cannot reach the foot of the Walls, whereby the <hi>Trees</hi> are lyable to a mortal drought, unleÅ¿s it be remedy'd by the Expedients explain'd in the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Wall Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>WeÅ¿tern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ure not only dreads <hi>North WeÅ¿t</hi> Winds in the Spring, which are Å¿o pernicious for <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> and in <hi>Autumn</hi> the Winds of that SeaÅ¿on, thoÅ¿e great throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers down of <hi>Fruit,</hi> but alÅ¿o, and that particularly in moiÅ¿t cold <hi>Grounds,</hi> the great <hi>Rains,</hi> which being commonly very frequent from the parts where the <hi>Sun</hi> Sets, often cauÅ¿es great DeÅ¿olations there; whereas on the oher hand, in dry light <hi>Earths,</hi> thoÅ¿e kind of Å¿howers repair the defects of Å¿terility, and amend the DiÅ¿orders caus'd by too much drought.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Northern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ition in relation to <hi>Wall Fruit Trees,</hi> if on the one Å¿ide it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for all Summer <hi>Fruits,</hi> and for Å¿ome in <hi>Autumn,</hi> on the other Å¿ide, it is very dangerous for the beauty and good taÅ¿te of thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Winter;</hi> but then again, it is the moÅ¿t advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious that can be during the great heats for <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Red Fruits,</hi> which we would make to hold out, as <hi>Straw-berries, Rasberries, Currans,</hi> &amp;c. I have likewiÅ¿e explain'd this matter at large in the TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> as well as in the uÅ¿e that is to be made of every particular Wall in a <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Finally,</hi> The reÅ¿ult of this Å¿mall TreatiÅ¿e about the ExpoÅ¿ition, is that all of them have their Perfections and Imperfections; we muÅ¿t endeavour to take our advantage of the firÅ¿t, and uÅ¿e all our InduÅ¿try to defend our Å¿elves from the laÅ¿t.</p>

                        <p>BeÅ¿ides, whatever <hi>Rain</hi> may fall, which indeed may be favourable to Å¿mall <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Strawberries, Greens, PeaÅ¿e, Beans, Sallad, Onions, &amp;c.</hi> There are Å¿till other <hi>Plants</hi> in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> which require Å¿omething more, for Example, <hi>Artichoks</hi> of a year or two's growth, which muÅ¿t be water'd regularly two or three times a week, a Pitcher at a time to every <hi>Foot;</hi> for if we think that a little <hi>Rain</hi> is Å¿ufficient to Å¿atisfie our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> we Å¿hall Å¿oon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we are groÅ¿ly deceiv'd, <hi>Gnats</hi> will annoy them, the head will remain Å¿mall, hard and dry; and finally, the <hi>Suckers</hi> will only produce <hi>Leaves;</hi> the Experience of what is Å¿een among Å¿ubÅ¿tantial Å¿ale <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> Å¿ufficiently juÅ¿tifies the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity and Importance of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings; they Å¿eldom fail watering of their <hi>Gardens</hi> whatever <hi>Rains</hi> may fall during the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> and indeed their Ware is much finer than that of others who water leÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>During Å¿even or eight Months of the Year, there is generally a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Watering all that grows in <hi>Kitchen Gardens, AÅ¿paragus</hi> only excepted, which only performing their Duty at the Entrance of the Spring are Å¿atisfied with the moiÅ¿tures of the Winter, and want none after the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May:</hi> But whereas thoÅ¿e two Months are the times of BlaÅ¿ting and Drought, there is often a NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of Watering even the new Planted <hi>Trees;</hi> nay, Å¿ometimes it is good to Water thoÅ¿e, which having brought forth a great Quantity of Green <hi>Fruit</hi> appear moderately Vigorous, and require Å¿ome help in order to a good Reaping, which they are preparing for us; eÅ¿pecially if the <hi>Earth</hi> be naturally dry and light, thoÅ¿e Waterings muÅ¿t not be neglected at the Time of the Summer SolÅ¿tice, and they muÅ¿t be renew'd in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> when the <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to form their <hi>Pulp,</hi> the SeaÅ¿on being very dry; otherwiÅ¿e they remain Å¿mall, Å¿tony and not pallatable.</p>
                        <p>From whence it naturally follows, that Water is abÅ¿olutely NeceÅ¿Å¿ary in <hi>Gardens,</hi> and that plentifully too, in order to perform the NeceÅ¿Å¿ary Waterings they require in due time; for indeed what can be made of any <hi>Ground</hi> without Water, it will remain altogether uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s for Productions, and diÅ¿agreeable to Å¿ight; therefore the beÅ¿t way is to pitch upon Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations that have the Convenience of Water; and whoever does not make that one of <note place="margin">Anima mea, Å¿icut terra Å¿ine aqua. <hi>PÅ¿al.

                        <p>The moÅ¿t common, and at the Å¿ame time the moÅ¿t wretch'd recourÅ¿e for Waterings is that of Wells: It is true that they are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, when no better can be had, but at leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould be choÅ¿en Å¿hallow, for certainly it is to be fear'd, that the Waterings will be very InconÅ¿iderable, and conÅ¿equently of little uÅ¿e, when the Water is difficult to be drawn up; the advantage of Pumps, though often deceitful, may be look'd upon as Å¿omething in that CaÅ¿e; but the disburthening of Å¿ome Springs or Conduits, a Neighbouring Canal, or a Å¿mall Pond well Å¿tor'd, and well kept with Pipes and Tubs diÅ¿tributed into Å¿everal Squares, are, as it were, the Soul of <hi>Vegetation;</hi> without it all is dead, or languiÅ¿hes in <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> though the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> be not faulty; but with it the whole <hi>Garden</hi> muÅ¿t needs be Vigorous, and abounding in every SeaÅ¿on of the Year, which will redound to the Honour of him who has the Management of it, whereas it will utterly DiÅ¿grace Å¿uch as have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to plead for an ExcuÅ¿e.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Fourth Condition, which requires the <hi>Garden</hi> to be partly upon a level, in all the Surface of it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is very difficult, nay very rare to meet with Situations that are Å¿o equal in all their Extent, as not to have any RiÅ¿e or Fall on any Å¿ide; but yet it is not impoÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: I do not think it very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to look for any to be as Å¿mooth as Water, but yet it is a happineÅ¿s when Å¿uch are met with; great Inequalities are certainly troubleÅ¿om for <hi>Gardens.</hi> The Inundations or Overflowings which happen after long Rains, cauÅ¿e cruel DiÅ¿orders in them, and cut out a World of Work to repair them; moderate Inequalities do no great harm, but rather good, eÅ¿pecially in a dry <hi>Earth,</hi> when inclining to a Wall expos'd to the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> that part, as we have already Å¿aid, being Å¿eldom Å¿oak'd by the Waters that fall from the Skies; they light moÅ¿t upon the ExpoÅ¿ure of the <hi>WeÅ¿t;</hi> and thus a fall guiding the Waters towards that <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> part, is very favourable.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in my Opinion, as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, a Å¿ituation that has but a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality is to be preferr'd before another that has much; and if any be tolerable, 'tis only that I have been Å¿peaking of; inÅ¿omuch, that in <hi>Gardens</hi> that are too much inclinable to Drought, or lie Å¿omewhat high, and are of a perfect Level, it will be proper to allow them a little inequality: For Example, Å¿uch a one as may be Imperceptible, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual in all the Walks that lie <hi>Southerly,</hi> to the end that the Water which is of no UÅ¿e in thoÅ¿e Walks may fall into the Feet of the <hi>Trees</hi> of thoÅ¿e two ExpoÅ¿itions.</p>
                        <p>Such an Artificial DeÅ¿cent produces two good Effects, the firÅ¿t in that it is to be wiÅ¿h'd that thoÅ¿e parts may never want a little moiÅ¿ture, in order to Correct their Drought, whether proceeding from the Nature of the <hi>Earth</hi> and Situation, or from the Heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> by thoÅ¿e Waters. The Å¿econd is to hinder thoÅ¿e Waters, by that means, from running into Å¿ome other parts of the <hi>Garden,</hi> where they might prove prejudicial.</p>
                        <p>But when there is an indiÅ¿penÅ¿able NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of making UÅ¿e of a Situation that is very unequal for a <hi>Garden.</hi> I explain hereafter in the Thirteenth Chapter what I think proper to be done, in order to Correct the Defects of it, as far as InduÅ¿try can reach.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IT will not be difficult for me to prove, That the Figure of our <hi>Gardens</hi> ought to be agreeable; it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary the Eyes Å¿hould meet at firÅ¿t wherewith to be Å¿atisfy'd, without any thing FantaÅ¿tical to offend them: The fineÅ¿t Figure that can be deÅ¿ir'd for a <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> and even the moÅ¿t convenient for <hi>Culture,</hi> is without doubt that which forms a Beautiful Square, eÅ¿pecially when it is Å¿o perfect, and Å¿o well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd in all its Extent, that not only the Corners may form Å¿treight Angles; but eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, that the Length may be above once and a half or twice as long again as it is broad: For InÅ¿tance, Twenty Fathom to Ten or Twelve, Fourty to Eighteen or Twenty, or FourÅ¿core to Forty, Fifty or ThreeÅ¿core, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is moÅ¿t certain, that thoÅ¿e Å¿quare Figures afford the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> wherewith to form fine Squares with EaÅ¿e, and to raiÅ¿e fine Beds; there is a great deal of Delight in Å¿eeing true Squares of <hi>Stawberries, Artichokes, AÅ¿paragus, &amp;c.</hi> great Beds of <hi>Charvel, ParÅ¿ly</hi> and <hi>Sorrel,</hi> all very even, Å¿treight, exactly proportion'd out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be done when the Figure is Irregular, or at leaÅ¿t, not without loÅ¿ing a great deal of Time, when in Å¿ome MeaÅ¿ure, to hide the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it, he endeavours to find or make Å¿omething approaching to a Square.</p>
                        <p>Whence it is eaÅ¿ie to conclude, how much I diÅ¿like in the CaÅ¿e of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> all other Indented Figures, Diagonals, Rounds, Ovals, Triangles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are only proper for <hi>Thickets</hi> and <hi>Parterres,</hi> or <hi>Flower Gardens,</hi> in which Places they are at once both very uÅ¿eful, and of a great Beauty.</p>
                        <p>I do not queÅ¿tion but all People will be Curious to afford their <hi>Gardens</hi> the Beautiful Figure now in QueÅ¿tion, when at Liberty to pick and chuÅ¿e. It is a great Vexation

                        <p>Although the Figure of an Oblong Right Angled Square, be the moÅ¿t proper, yet I have made a fine <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> of one hundred and ten <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or Fathoms in length, and Å¿ixty broad, Å¿omewhat reÅ¿embling the Figure A of a <hi>Lozenge;</hi> and whereas I have diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the chief Entrance in the middle of the narroweÅ¿t Å¿ide, it is not eaÅ¿ie to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the Å¿mall Irregularity a <hi>Geometritian</hi> would Å¿ind in it, and it is a very neceÅ¿Å¿ary Precaution to conceal as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, certain inconÅ¿iderable defects, which are met with in the Å¿pace of a <hi>Garden,</hi> and to diÅ¿poÅ¿e the Ally's, and the diviÅ¿ion of the Squares or Plats, as if the <hi>Ground</hi> was exactly of a Square Figure; for though neither the Angles or the four Å¿ides are perfectly equal, it does not hinder the Plats from appearing perfect in their Proportion.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, for the better Ornament of our <hi>Kitchen Garden,</hi> eÅ¿pecially if it be large, it is proper that the Entrance Å¿hould be plac'd juÅ¿t in the middle of that part which has moÅ¿t Extent, as it appears by the Figure at the Point A in order to face an Alley, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of the whole length of the <hi>Garden,</hi> may appear Å¿tately, and divide the <hi>Ground</hi> into two equal parts; each of thoÅ¿e parts, compoÅ¿ing Squares or Plats too long in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their breadth, muÅ¿t afterwards be Å¿ubdivided into other Å¿mall parts, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary; the Entrance would not look Å¿o well in the middle of one of the broadeÅ¿t Å¿ides, as it appears by the Figure B. a long ProÅ¿pect, moderately broad on both Å¿ides is much more pleaÅ¿ing; than to have a long one on the Å¿ides, and a Å¿hort one before; however, it is Å¿ometimes impoÅ¿Å¿ible to diÅ¿poÅ¿e the Entrance otherwiÅ¿e, and in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e we muÅ¿t have Patience, and the Å¿ame when we are neceÅ¿Å¿itated to make it in one of the Corners, or thereabouts, though it be not Å¿o well; yet I have made very fine <hi>Gardens,</hi> which have their Entrance in one of the Corners, which I would not have done, had the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition of the <hi>Ground</hi> permitted me to place it better; and yet no body finds fault with it, by reaÅ¿on that it faces a fine Alley, which is border'd all along by one of the great <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> or Walls full of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is very agreeable to the Å¿ight, when it is kept in good Order, Å¿uch is the Entrance of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>Rambouillet.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS IncloÅ¿ure, I deÅ¿ire, Å¿ufficiently teÅ¿tifies, that for <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen Gardens</hi> I am not very deÅ¿irous of thoÅ¿e open ProÅ¿pects which are Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary for other <hi>Gardens;</hi> not but when the Situation will permit, I am very glad to enjoy the benefit of it.

                        <p>So that preferably to all manner of ProÅ¿pects, I would have my <hi>Garden</hi> inclos'd with Walls, though I were to loÅ¿e Å¿ome fine point of ProÅ¿pect by it, beÅ¿ides that the Å¿helter they may afford againÅ¿t troubleÅ¿ome Winds, and Spring FroÅ¿ts, are very conÅ¿iderable: It is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be truly delighted with a <hi>Garden,</hi> as for inÅ¿tance, to have early <hi>Legumes</hi> and fine <hi>Fruits</hi> without the help of thoÅ¿e Walls; beÅ¿ides, there are Å¿till many things, which dreading great heats, would hardly be able to grow in the hotteÅ¿t part of the Summer, unleÅ¿s a Wall expos'd to the <hi>North</hi> favour'd them with Å¿ome Å¿hadow.</p>
                        <p>In effect, Walls are Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary for <hi>Gardens,</hi> that even to multiply them, I make as many little <hi>Gardens</hi> as I can in the Neighbourhood of the great one, whereby I have not only more <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> or <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> and Å¿helter, which is very conÅ¿iderable; but am alÅ¿o thereby enabled to correct Å¿ome defects and Irregularities, which would render the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> deÅ¿agreeable; for in fine, I will at any rate have a principal <hi>Garden,</hi> that may pleaÅ¿e in its Figure and Å¿ize, deÅ¿ign'd for large <hi>Legumes,</hi> and Å¿ome high <hi>Standards;</hi> a large <hi>Garden</hi> would without doubt be leÅ¿s pleaÅ¿ing, if for InÅ¿tance, it were too long for its breadth, or too wide for its length, if it had a corner, or Å¿ome viÅ¿ible wrineÅ¿s to disfigure it, which being retrench'd, would make all the reÅ¿t Å¿quare; and thus Å¿uch <hi>Gardens</hi> being leÅ¿Å¿en'd either on one, or on both ends, will afford ground to make little agreeable uÅ¿eful <hi>Gardens,</hi> as I have done in many great HouÅ¿es, in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Am not ignorant that the Countrey affords large and moderate HouÅ¿es, of which the firÅ¿t may be accompany'd with Å¿everal <hi>Gardens,</hi> and the other Å¿atisfy'd with one only.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48210:44"/>
As to thoÅ¿e which may have Å¿everal <hi>Gardens,</hi> it is proper that thoÅ¿e that are deÅ¿ign'd for <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> I mean the <hi>Parterres,</hi> Å¿hould face the principal AÅ¿pect of the HouÅ¿e, Å¿ince nothing can be more agreeable than to Å¿ee at all times on that Å¿ide the charming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of a SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of <hi>Flowers</hi> whatever they be; they are Å¿o many different Scenes, or Decorations upon a Stage, of which the Figure never alters, they afford perpetual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to delight the Eye, and charm us with their Sweets; but whereas generally thoÅ¿e <hi>Parterres</hi> are as publick, and as open to every body as the very Court of the HouÅ¿e, it is not fit to put any thing into them, the loÅ¿s whereof might diÅ¿compoÅ¿e us.</p>
                        <p>For theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons I allow that in Å¿uch HouÅ¿es, the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> Å¿hould not be Situated in the beÅ¿t Place, beÅ¿ides the laÅ¿t being Å¿ubject to have many things, which though neceÅ¿Å¿ary, are not always pleaÅ¿ing to the Eye or Smell; as alÅ¿o producing many things, deÅ¿ign'd for the PleaÅ¿ure and Satisfaction of the MaÅ¿ter, which might tempt Å¿ome licouriÅ¿h indiÅ¿creet PerÅ¿ons, and Å¿o occaÅ¿ion cauÅ¿e of DiÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure and Complaint, I think it very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to place thoÅ¿e <hi>Gardens</hi> out of the reach of the Publick.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as much as can be, we content our Å¿elves with placing them in the beÅ¿t <hi>Ground</hi> we can meet with, without prejudicing the place of the <hi>Parterre,</hi> pretty near to <note place="margin">Optima Å¿terco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio veÅ¿tigia domini. <hi>Ex Pln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi>
                           </note> the HouÅ¿e, being of a convenient eaÅ¿ie AcceÅ¿s; the Ancients were of this Sentiment, when they Å¿aid, that the Steps of the MaÅ¿ter, that is, his frequent ViÅ¿its, were of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful uÅ¿e for the NeatneÅ¿s, Abundance, GoodneÅ¿s and Beauty of <hi>Gardens;</hi> Å¿o that <hi>Gardens</hi> that are at a diÅ¿tance, or of difficult AcceÅ¿s, are liable to DiÅ¿orders, Filth and Sterility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope that whereas in the beginning of this Work, I have preÅ¿um'd to Å¿ay, that none ought to pretend to have one of our <hi>Gardens,</hi> unleÅ¿s he were paÅ¿Å¿ably well skill'd in the <hi>Culture</hi> of it; none will undertake to make one, unleÅ¿s he may be able to afford himÅ¿elf the PleaÅ¿ure of Å¿eeing it well <hi>Cultivated,</hi> and conÅ¿equently he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire to Å¿ee it often, which cannot be done, the <hi>Garden</hi> being at a diÅ¿tance, or of a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult AcceÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>As to the HouÅ¿es, that can no wiÅ¿e afford above one <hi>Garden,</hi> I Å¿uppoÅ¿e it will hardly enter into any ones Thoughts to employ it wholly in <hi>Box</hi> or <hi>Bowling-Greens,</hi> inÅ¿tead of Imploying it in <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes:</hi> In Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, whether in the Town or Country, the Å¿pace of the <hi>Garden</hi> being reaÅ¿onably large, it will be proper to take part of that which is neareÅ¿t to make a Å¿mall <hi>Parterre,</hi> leaving the reÅ¿t for things that are of uÅ¿e and neceÅ¿Å¿ary; but if the Place be not large, my Advice is to make no <hi>Parterre;</hi> at leaÅ¿t I would make none, being perÅ¿uaded, that <hi>Flowers</hi> may be eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿pens'd with; reÅ¿olving then to employ ones <hi>Ground</hi> in <hi>Plants</hi> that are for uÅ¿e; that part of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> which is moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ing, ought to be put moÅ¿t within Å¿ight of the HouÅ¿e, keeping Å¿uch as might offend the Sight or Smell, moÅ¿t at diÅ¿tance: <hi>Fine EÅ¿paliers, Dwarfs, Greens, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, Sallads</hi> and the perpetual Action of the <hi>Gard'ners, &amp;c.</hi> being Å¿ufficient to employ the Neighbourhood of Å¿ome Windows, even for pretty conÅ¿iderable HouÅ¿es, as well as for ordinary ones.</p>
                        <p>I am Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of the innocent PleaÅ¿ure, the Å¿ight of a fine <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> can afford, that I am for making Å¿ome fine Arbor in all large <hi>Gardens,</hi> not only to Å¿erve for Å¿helter in caÅ¿e of a Å¿udden Storm, which happens pretty often, but alÅ¿o for the Satisfaction of conveniently Å¿eeing the <hi>Culture</hi> of a <hi>Ground</hi> that is well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</p>
                        <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding all I have Å¿aid, I do not condemn thoÅ¿e, who having but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿mall <hi>Garden,</hi> affect <hi>Flowers,</hi> their Inclination leading them to it preferably to any other <hi>Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having Å¿aid what is to be wiÅ¿h'd for, when People are at liberty to chooÅ¿e the Place of a <hi>Garden,</hi> let us now conÅ¿ider what is to be done when within the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a HouÅ¿e, we find our Å¿elves reduc'd and neceÅ¿Å¿itated to make uÅ¿e of any Place, whatever it may be, regular or irregular, good, indifferent or bad; and let us follow the Å¿ame Order we have obÅ¿erv'd in the pretended choice I have explain'd.</p>

                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, I cannot forbear pitying thoÅ¿e who Å¿tart Å¿o Ill, as to make a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in a place where the <hi>Ground</hi> is abÅ¿olutely defective, eÅ¿pecially if there were any poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of placing it better. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> I pity them, by reaÅ¿on of the great charge they expoÅ¿e themÅ¿elves to, which I dread of all things, eÅ¿pecially in <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> being perÅ¿waded that the property of thoÅ¿e <hi>Gardens</hi> is to coÅ¿t little, and to yield much. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I pity them for the Å¿mall SucceÅ¿s, that infallibly attends Å¿uch an undertaking, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when thoÅ¿e Works that are neceÅ¿Å¿ary there, are only perform'd by halves: I wiÅ¿h none of the Curious may be expos'd to Å¿uch HardÅ¿hips; but yet Å¿uppoÅ¿ing an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of falling into the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, to make a <hi>Garden</hi> in a very bad <hi>Ground,</hi> let us conÅ¿ider what remedy may be apply'd to it, and finally endeavour to make this <hi>Garden</hi> with as few Defects, and as Å¿mall a Charge as can be poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FirÅ¿t</hi> then, if the <hi>Earth</hi> be abÅ¿olutely defective, either in Å¿tinking or being abÅ¿olute Loam or Clay, or Å¿uch as is dug out of Quarries, or elÅ¿e Stony, Gravelly and full of Pebbles; or, laÅ¿tly, being only dry <hi>Sand</hi> of any Colour, but Å¿till as unfruitful as the <hi>Sand</hi> of Rivers, and yet as high as to the Surface, as can be deÅ¿ir'd for a <hi>Garden.</hi> I will explain hereafter what I mean by that height.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay, if this <hi>Earth</hi> happen to have any of theÅ¿e Defects, I know no better Expedient than to have it altogether taken away, in order to Å¿ucceed, and that within the Depth of three Foot in Å¿uch Places as are to be the chief Ornaments of the <hi>Gardens; viz.</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> and long Rooted <hi>Plants,</hi> and two large Foot where the leÅ¿Å¿er <hi>Plants</hi> are to be, filling it up again with the Å¿ame quantity of the beÅ¿t <hi>Mould</hi> that can conveniently be brought to it; which being done, one may reÅ¿t Å¿atisfy'd for a long while, all will go well, without the trouble of any other Amendments; but in caÅ¿e Å¿o much good <hi>Mould</hi> as would be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to put every where, could not conveniently be had; at leaÅ¿t it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to endeavour to get as much as may Å¿erve for the <hi>Trees,</hi> making a Å¿hift with indifferent good <hi>Mould</hi> for the reÅ¿t of the <hi>Garden,</hi> that is, for <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> it will not be difficult to amend it, as Å¿hall be declar'd hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I am Å¿enÅ¿ible, that the Charge of great TranÅ¿portations, frightens, eÅ¿pecially in the caÅ¿e of large <hi>Gardens,</hi> but then 'tis but Å¿eldom that People engage themÅ¿elves to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity of it; thoÅ¿e are works for Kings, the <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> of <hi>VerÅ¿ailles</hi> is a terrible InÅ¿tance of it: But as for Å¿mall City <hi>Gardens,</hi> the occaÅ¿ions of doing it are often met with, and whereas the Expence of it is not too great, the Undertaking of it is very tollerable. This then is all that is to be done, when the Surface of the <hi>Garden</hi> is no higher than it ought to be, and has no other Defect than the ill Quality of the <hi>Ground.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to Explain my Å¿elf as to this height, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e that the Matter in Hand only relates to the <hi>Garden</hi> that is immediately next the HouÅ¿e, for which it is, and no wiÅ¿e for others, which Lying at a greater diÅ¿tance do not want Å¿o much precaution; now, in my Opinion, this firÅ¿t <hi>Garden</hi> ought to lie Å¿omewhat lower than the HouÅ¿e, and thus the HouÅ¿e being upon a higher <hi>Ground,</hi> it ought to have a BalluÅ¿tre with Å¿ome Steps to come down into that <hi>Garden,</hi> which is an Ornament to be wiÅ¿h'd for in Å¿uch OccaÅ¿ions, and without doubt Å¿uch an aÅ¿Å¿ent of Two or Three Foot above the <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Garden,</hi> renders it much more pleaÅ¿ant to Sight, than it would be, if it lay level with the Å¿tep of the Door, and conÅ¿equently much finer than thoÅ¿e that lay higher than the level or floor; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an aÅ¿Å¿ent, and are thereby liable to great Inconveniences.</p>

I return to the other CaÅ¿es heretofore propos'd to Å¿ay, That in caÅ¿e Å¿uch a Place full of ill <hi>Earth,</hi> were too low, of about Five or Six Foot in Surface, it is viÅ¿ible that half the Expence would be Å¿av'd, Å¿ince there would only be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of raiÅ¿ing it higher, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any of it away; but however we muÅ¿t Å¿till reckon firÅ¿t on the Å¿mall deÅ¿cent the <hi>Garden</hi> ought to be Å¿ituated upon, in relation to the HouÅ¿e; and, Å¿econdly upon the Three Foot of <hi>Earth</hi> that muÅ¿t be brought thither, particularly for the <hi>Trees</hi> and large <hi>Plants,</hi> and in order not to be miÅ¿taken, it will be proper to meaÅ¿ure that <hi>Earth</hi> upon the place where it is to be taken with a rul'd Gage, by reaÅ¿on that this height of Three Foot, as it lies, being newly Å¿tir'd, will at firÅ¿t appear to make a greater DimenÅ¿ion, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being Å¿ettled will reduce it Å¿elf to the height propos'd, which I hold to be abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neccÅ¿Å¿ary, and unleÅ¿s care has been taken to meaÅ¿ure the <hi>Earth</hi> before the moving of it, People muÅ¿t not flatter themÅ¿elves that there will be enough, unleÅ¿s there be Four Foot or thereabouts in the firÅ¿t Months, which the Rains and Time will Å¿oon reduce to Three; otherwiÅ¿e, having had but Three Foot at firÅ¿t, they will Å¿oon find it dwindled to Two at moÅ¿t; that is too little by a Foot: And thus People will be expos'd to the Vexationof Å¿eeing all their <hi>Trees</hi> periÅ¿h at the end of a few Years, and to be reduc'd to begin a new, if they continu'd in the mind of mkaing their <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿ucceed.</p>
                        <p>In the Neighbourhood of great Cities, great Conveniences may Å¿ometimes be met with to raiÅ¿e and fill up places in <hi>Gardens</hi> without much coÅ¿t, 'tis only allowing the Liberty of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the RubbiÅ¿h of the Foundations of HouÅ¿es there; but often Å¿uch Conveniences coÅ¿t a great deal of Time, which in the CaÅ¿e of Planting is much to be fear'd, and even coÅ¿ts a great deal of Money to have it Å¿ifted, otherwiÅ¿e the <hi>Garden</hi> will be in danger of having more Stones and ill Sand than real <hi>Earth,</hi> and conÅ¿equently the Owner of having an ill <hi>Garden;</hi> upon which every one may conÅ¿ult his PurÅ¿e and PleaÅ¿ure, and regulate himÅ¿elf accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The AnÅ¿wer I have made to the firÅ¿t Article, relating to a very ill <hi>Earth,</hi> where a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> is deÅ¿ign'd, may likewiÅ¿e Å¿erve for the Fourth, in which we Å¿uppoÅ¿e a place for a <hi>Garden</hi> without any <hi>Earth</hi> at all; Three Foot of good <hi>Earth</hi> muÅ¿t be brought to it, getting it as near hand as can be to Å¿ave Money.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the <hi>Earth</hi> is really good; but yet there is not enough of it to accompliÅ¿h Three Foot depth, two ConÅ¿iderations are to be had; the firÅ¿t to examine whether the Surface be of a proper height or not: When it is of a proper height, all that is nought in the Ground muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be removed, whether Sand, Gravel or Stones, putting as much good <hi>Mould</hi> in the Room of it, as will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to have the depth requir'd, Å¿till preÅ¿erving our Height.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Å¿ame Operation muÅ¿t be perform'd, in removing all that is bad under good <hi>Earth,</hi> when the Surface being, too high compar'd to the level of the HouÅ¿e, there is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿inking it, in order to be one Å¿tep higher than the level of the <hi>Garden;</hi> upon which all People may eaÅ¿ily regulate themÅ¿elves, to do it more or leÅ¿s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigencies of their <hi>Ground</hi> and its wants; but Å¿till, keeping to the quantity of good <hi>Earth</hi> propos'd, as well as to the diÅ¿tance that muÅ¿t be from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Garden</hi> to the Door which Å¿erves for an Entrance into it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> being according to our WiÅ¿hes, both as to quantity and goodneÅ¿s, and yet too low in the Surface; we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e examin how much too low it lyes, in order to raiÅ¿e it conformably to our Wants and WiÅ¿hes; it might chance to lay Å¿o low, that there would be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity to raiÅ¿e it conÅ¿iderably above three Foot, in which caÅ¿e all the good <hi>Earth</hi> muÅ¿t be dug up, and laid aÅ¿ide, and the bottom rais'd Å¿ufficiently with what ever could be got good or bad; after which the good <hi>Earth</hi> muÅ¿t be laid over it again with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and mixture heretofore explain'd.

There now remains to Examine what is to be done in the fifth CaÅ¿e, to correct the over great MoiÅ¿tures Å¿ome <hi>Gardens</hi> are Å¿ubject to, which rot every thing, and make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction not only backward, but alÅ¿o inÅ¿ipid and bad; none but hot and dry <hi>Earths</hi> are forward; thoÅ¿e that are moiÅ¿t are always cold, and conÅ¿equently have no diÅ¿poÅ¿ition for <note place="margin">At Å¿celeratum exquirere frigus difficile eÅ¿t. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2. Labor omnia vincit improbus, &amp;c. <hi>Virg. Georg.</hi> 1.</note> Novelties. This cold which is inÅ¿eparable from MoiÅ¿ture, is of all defects the moÅ¿t diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be cur'd: The Ancients knew it as well as we do, and have given it the Name of Deceiver. But Å¿till Å¿ince <hi>Earth</hi> has been Å¿ubmitted to the InduÅ¿try of Man, and that there are but few things labour cannot overcome; let us declare what a long Experience has taught us in this CaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>MoiÅ¿tures are either natural and perpetual in <hi>Earth,</hi> or only accidental and paÅ¿Å¿ing; in the firÅ¿t caÅ¿e we have two Expedients:</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t is, to turn aÅ¿ide at a diÅ¿tance, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, by Conduits or Gutters, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that annoy us, and give them a diÅ¿charge to remove them from us, which being done, the <hi>Ground</hi> will not fail becoming dry; and when the firÅ¿t is impracticable,</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd is, To raiÅ¿e the whole <hi>Plats,</hi> or only the great <hi>Beds</hi> upon Ridges, and to that end make deep Furrows to Å¿erve for kind of <hi>Paths:</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> that is taken from thence will Å¿erve to raiÅ¿e the <hi>Plats</hi> or <hi>Beds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if thoÅ¿e MoiÅ¿tures are only TranÅ¿itory, and, for InÅ¿tance, only occaÅ¿ion'd by great <hi>Rains,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Ground</hi> not proper to Å¿oak them in, recourÅ¿e muÅ¿t be had to the Å¿ame Expedient of raiÅ¿ing of the <hi>Earth</hi> to drain them, and to the making of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits or Gutters to carry thoÅ¿e Waters out of the <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Finally,</hi> The MoiÅ¿ture not being extraordinary, the contrary of what we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿crib'd for very dry <hi>Grounds</hi> muÅ¿t be done, that is, the <hi>Earth</hi> muÅ¿t be rais'd a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Walks, to the end that thoÅ¿e Walks may Å¿erve as a drain to thoÅ¿e elevated <hi>Beds,</hi> juÅ¿t as in the other CaÅ¿e the haughing of the Borders Å¿erves as a drain to receive and improve by the Waters of the adjacent Walks.</p>
                        <p>In order to raiÅ¿e <hi>Grounds,</hi> nothing can be better than what we have Å¿aid to raiÅ¿e the Surface; and in caÅ¿e Conveniences be wanting for the TranÅ¿portation of <hi>Earth,</hi> having abundance of great Dung at hand, it may be us'd inÅ¿tead of it, as I have Å¿aid about the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> mixing it abundantly at the bottom of the <hi>Ground,</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the <hi>Earth,</hi> in order to raiÅ¿e it as much as is neceÅ¿Å¿ary; but Å¿till great Conduits are of great uÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>I conclude what relates to the Preparation of Å¿uch <hi>Grounds</hi> as are defective, either in their quality, or too Å¿mall quantity, carefully exhorting thoÅ¿e who dig the Ground along Å¿ome Walls, to take care firÅ¿t not to approach too near the Foundations, and to leave always Å¿ome Å¿olid Banck undug, leÅ¿t the Wall might tumble down by its own weight, or by Å¿ome unexpected Å¿howers. I exhort in the Å¿econd place to fill up Å¿uch Trenches immediately after their being empty'd, or rather at the very Å¿ame time, one part after another; for want of which, and for the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿ons, the danger of tumbling is yet greater.</p>
                        <p>After having examin'd what relates to the Conditions that are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> that are to be made, <hi>viz.</hi> The quality and quantity of good <hi>Earth,</hi> the happy Situation, and favourable ExpoÅ¿ure, the convenience of Waterings, the level of the Ground, the Figure, Entrance and CloÅ¿ure of the <hi>Garden,</hi> together with the Proximity of the Place; having alÅ¿o propos'd the means to correct the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Drought and MoiÅ¿ture, there Å¿till remains to Å¿peak upon the Subject of the Acclivities and Declivities, when they are too Å¿leep for the <hi>Gardens</hi> we are abÅ¿olutely compell'd to chooÅ¿e.</p>

                        <p>WE have already Å¿aid what is to be wiÅ¿h'd for certain Inequalities, that may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable in <hi>Gardens,</hi> and InÅ¿inuated what is to be fear'd from the Inconveniences of the great ones; let us now Å¿peak of what may be proper to remedy Å¿uch as may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; In order to which, as Å¿oon as the Place of the <hi>Garden</hi> is reÅ¿olv'd on, upon the ConÅ¿iderations heretofore eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, the Figure being either very Å¿quare, Å¿o that the Sides and Angles may be altogether, or at leaÅ¿t partly Equal and Parallel, which is moÅ¿t to be wiÅ¿h'd for; or elÅ¿e Irregular, the Angles or Sides being unequal, or having perhaps more or leÅ¿s than four Sides or Angles, both the one and the other differing in themÅ¿elves, either in length or overture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Defects fit to be avoided, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, or at leaÅ¿t endeavours muÅ¿t be us'd to rectifie them.</p>
                        <p>The Place of the <hi>Garden</hi> being, I Å¿ay, reÅ¿olv'd upon, either Voluntarily or out of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity, the EncloÅ¿ure muÅ¿t not be begun, until after having taken the Level of all the <hi>Ground,</hi> to know all the Acclivities and Declivities, in order to take MeaÅ¿ures accordingly; otherwiÅ¿e one might fall into many great Inconveniences, either as to the Walls that are to be made, or in reÅ¿pect to the Allies and Squares.</p>
                        <p>It is moÅ¿t certain; that every piece of <hi>Ground</hi> may chance to have different RiÅ¿ings and Falls, <hi>viz.</hi> One, Two or Three for as many Å¿ides; and One for every Diagonal: And 'tis almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to know the true Level of a <hi>Garden,</hi> without having firÅ¿t taken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards regulated all the Inequalities.</p>
                        <p>The Diagonals, to Å¿peak more Intelligibly in Favour of Å¿ome <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> are, as it were, the two Arms of a St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s CroÅ¿s, which may and ought to be figur'd by Trenches carried from Corner to Corner a croÅ¿s Å¿ome Place.</p>
                        <p>There is no neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿aying, that the Level of thoÅ¿e Inequalities are always taken from the higheÅ¿t part of the piece that is to be Level'd, to go to the loweÅ¿t which is oppoÅ¿ite to it, no Body being ignorant of it. Thus the Level of the Diagonals is taken, beginning from Corner, or Angle, to go to a lower oppoÅ¿ite Corner: For InÅ¿tance, the Diagonal A. B. begins at a Corner or Angles, which is form'd by the meeting of two Å¿ides, whereof the one is expos'd to the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> and the other to the <hi>South,</hi> to go to a lower oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide, which is form'd by the meeting of the Å¿ide expos'd to the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> and the Å¿ide expos'd to the <hi>North;</hi> the other Diagonal Å¿hall be drawn from the one to the other of the two Corners, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, C. D. which remain in the Figure we are examining, and is mark'd here. The
<figure/>
Level of the ExpoÅ¿ure is taken all along every Å¿ide, beginning, as we have Å¿aid, from the higheÅ¿t part to come to the loweÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48210:46"/>
In order to take every Level very true, it muÅ¿t be done upon a very Å¿treight Line, which Å¿hall be drawn either along the Å¿ide that is to be level'd, which is the beÅ¿t; or upon another Line very Parallel to that Å¿ide.</p>
                        <p>Every Level to be pretty true, though not Å¿o true as that of the Water of Fountains, in which even half a Line is very material; but, in fine, to be Å¿ufficient for the uÅ¿e now in queÅ¿tion, every Level, I Å¿ay, muÅ¿t be taken with the Rule and Leveller, which every body knows is a Triangular InÅ¿trument with a Lead, or other little Bowl hung to a Å¿mall
<figure/>
Cord, and that fix'd to the obtuÅ¿e Angle; this Leveller being fix'd upon the Rule, this Å¿mall Cord muÅ¿t meet the notch that is made on purpoÅ¿e, both on the Top of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and upon the middle point of the Å¿ide that Å¿erves for a BaÅ¿is to that InÅ¿trument, inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that that Level is never true until that Cord with its Lead naturally falls into thoÅ¿e Notches.</p>
                        <p>This is the manner of performing this Operation, which I might, perhaps, Å¿ave my Å¿elf the trouble of Explaining, it being already Explain'd in Å¿o many Books of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Mechanicks; but our <hi>Gard'ner</hi> perhaps having none of them, will be Å¿atisfy'd with what I Å¿hall tell him.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides the Leveller and the Rule, which muÅ¿t be very Å¿treight, and about Two or Three Fathom long, there muÅ¿t be three wooden Spikes to be driven into the <hi>Ground</hi> with a Mallet; and thoÅ¿e three Spikes muÅ¿t be of a very even equal length, about Three or Four Foot, all Å¿plit on the Top, in order to put white Paper in that Å¿lit.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hould not need to Å¿ay (it being evident of it Å¿elf) That there muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t Three or Four PerÅ¿ons, that is, Three while the Rule and Leveller are us'd, and Four when it comes to the Spikes; one of theÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons muÅ¿t in all CaÅ¿es Å¿tand on the loweÅ¿t part of the Å¿ide that is to be Levell'd, holding a Perch to Å¿erve for a Mark, in order to raiÅ¿e or louer the Å¿aid Perch, according to the Direction of him who is to regulate the Line and Leveller.</p>
                        <p>To find the Level: Having choÅ¿en a calm Day without Wind and Rain, and, if poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, a little lou'ring; or, at leaÅ¿t, being Å¿o plac'd, that the great brightneÅ¿s of the <hi>Sun</hi> may not prejudice the Sight, one of theÅ¿e Spikes muÅ¿t be driven into the <hi>Ground</hi> even to the Surface, which muÅ¿t remain, and another in a Å¿treight Line a little below it; in order to place the Rule immediately and conveniently upon it, which being done, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller muÅ¿t be put upon the Rule, raiÅ¿ing or Å¿inking the Å¿econd Spike, until the Lead falls directly, and of it Å¿elf, without any Motion of the Wind, or any thing elÅ¿e into the Notches.</p>
                        <p>This being perform'd, the Å¿econd Spike muÅ¿t be abÅ¿olutely fix'd, and the Leveller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, after which, lying flat upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> one may aim or level with the Eye upon the Rule Å¿o fix'd and order'd towards the PerÅ¿on who holds the Perch below with a white or black Cloth on the Top of it, who perhaps may have had occaÅ¿ion to climb upon a Ladder, Wall or Tree, to raiÅ¿e or louer the Å¿aid Perch according to the direction of the Leveller, and that until the Extremity of it, having been obÅ¿erv'd by the Å¿aid Leveller, a Calculation may be made exactly how many Foot or Fathoms there are in a direct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Line from that Extremity, which is the Top of the Perch or Spike, unto the natural Surface of the <hi>Ground,</hi> which lies immediately beneath the Å¿aid Perch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas the poÅ¿ture of lying down is too Inconvenient; the <hi>Ground</hi> may and ought to be dug near the firÅ¿t Spike that is driven into the <hi>Ground,</hi> low enough for any one to level with the Eye, Å¿tanding, Å¿itting or kneeling in it; or elÅ¿e uÅ¿e may be made of two of the Spikes heretofore mention'd, to which end they muÅ¿t be plac'd aÅ¿under upon two others that are fix'd into the <hi>Ground,</hi> or upon Å¿ome other piece of Wood, or riÅ¿ing <hi>Ground</hi> made on purpoÅ¿e, where they muÅ¿t be kept very upright, after which the Rule muÅ¿t be plac'd upon the Å¿aid Å¿ticks, examining with the Leveller, whether the Rule lies
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48210:47"/>
upon a true level, in order to level or aim with the Eye, and when there is occaÅ¿ion for a third perÅ¿on, and conÅ¿equently for a third Å¿tick, they muÅ¿t be plac'd with the Å¿ame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneÅ¿s as the two firÅ¿t; the third being plac'd at any diÅ¿tance whatever, having a piece of Linen, or Paper, or a Hat upon the top of that Å¿pike, Å¿erves to aim more conveniently; Å¿o that having met at the End of the proÅ¿pect, the extremity of the perch or Å¿tick that is held below, the borrow'd height of the Å¿ticks, as well as the height of the Rule, muÅ¿t be deduc'd upon the whole, and thus the Level will prove true. For InÅ¿tance, in aiming, Twelve Foot may be found from the top of the Perch to the Surface of the <hi>Earth,</hi> out of which may be deduc'd firÅ¿t the four borrow'd Foot of the Å¿ticks, upon the Top of which the Leveller had laid his Rule, for which muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be deduc'd Three or Four Inches, which altogether amounts to Four Foot, and Four Inches; by which Supputation will be found Å¿even Foot and Eight Inches declivity from that part of the Surface which is regulated, and to remain, from whence the Leveller aim'd, to the Surface of that part, where the laÅ¿t Å¿pike Å¿tuck, the level of which is look'd for.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e Inequalities are either ConÅ¿iderable, or not.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e that are InconÅ¿iderable are tolerable; for InÅ¿tance, only half an Inch or an Inch and a half in a Fathom, which hardly wants, being corrected, if the Expence will amount to any thing conÅ¿iderable; Å¿o that a declivity of about a Foot or Two, or Two and a half to a length of Twenty Fathom, will do no great harm, and would hardly be percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, being only of half an Inch, or an Inch and half in a Fathom: Which ought to comfort one, eÅ¿pecially if there be a great length, Å¿ince a declivity of Twelve or Fifteen Foot upon FourÅ¿core Fathom in length, though pernicious, is not Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible nor inconvenient as one of Two Foot and a half upon Twenty Fathom, although the proportion be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together equal.</p>
                        <p>If a deÅ¿cent of two, or two Inches and a half <hi>per</hi> Fathom is conÅ¿iderable, what would it be if there were three, four, five, or more, then it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be corrected, which may be done four ways.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> in Å¿inking that part of the Ground which lyes too high, as much as will be neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to take away the roughneÅ¿s of the AÅ¿cent; and, in the Å¿econd place, in carrying to the lower part what Å¿hall be taken from the higher, whereby a deÅ¿cent of five Foot will be reduc'd to three, taking a foot from the upper part, and placing it upon the lower; Å¿o that the upper will be a Foot lower than it was, and the lower a Foot higher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But whereas, above all things, care muÅ¿t be taken to preÅ¿erve always three large Foot in depth of good <hi>Earth,</hi> before any thing be taken away from the upper part, holes muÅ¿t be made in different places of it, to examin how much good <hi>Earth</hi> we have there, in order to decide, whether we may really take any of it away, and how much; or whether we cannot take any part of it without prejudice to the Ground of the <hi>Garden;</hi> upon which it is eaÅ¿ie to reÅ¿olve; for the depth of good <hi>Earth</hi> being Å¿ufficient to bear a diminution, part of it muÅ¿t be taken away to moderate the declivity in queÅ¿tion.</p>
                        <p>But if, on the contrary, none of it can be taken away without prejudice to the depth or quantity that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary there, recourÅ¿e muÅ¿t be had to a third Expedient, which is, either not to meddle with the height at all, and to raiÅ¿e the lower part as well as we can for the beÅ¿t, in putting more good <hi>Earth</hi> over that which is good already, if it can be done conveniently, or elÅ¿e to take up that which is good, to put worÅ¿e at the bottom, nay even Stones or Gravel, if nothing better can be had; afterwards covering it all again with the good <hi>Earth</hi> that was taken up before; or if the Ground of the upper part may be Å¿unk, all the good <hi>Earth</hi> muÅ¿t be taken up and laid aÅ¿ide, until Å¿o much of the bad, which lay under it, as Å¿hall be thought proper, Å¿hall have been remov'd; which being done, that which is good Å¿hall be laid again in the room of the bad.</p>
                        <p>But in caÅ¿e none of theÅ¿e three Expedients be practicable, we muÅ¿t make uÅ¿e of the fourth, which is pretty chargeable, but yet abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary; and he who meets with Å¿o untoward a Situation, muÅ¿t comfort himÅ¿elf as well as he can, if he deÅ¿igns to have a profitable pleaÅ¿ant <hi>Garden,</hi> Å¿ince it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to compaÅ¿s it by any other means.</p>
                        <p>This fourth Expedient is to divide this great deÅ¿cent into different degrees, or different Portions, to make Å¿everal particular TerraÅ¿Å¿es of it, Å¿ome higher, and Å¿ome lower, and all of them more or leÅ¿s broad, according as the declivity is more or leÅ¿s conÅ¿iderable; after which every one of thoÅ¿e TerraÅ¿Å¿es Å¿hall be diÅ¿pos'd in themÅ¿elves, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod aforementioned, in order to correct moderate Inequalities; but that is not all, for every one of thoÅ¿e TerraÅ¿Å¿es muÅ¿t be Å¿upported and Å¿tay'd to hinder them from tumbling down, which muÅ¿t be done by little Walls, or Å¿mall Banks well beaten and trampled, with Å¿ome Å¿teps proper to deÅ¿cend from the one to the other, or elÅ¿e by Å¿ome Banks that Å¿hall be Å¿odded on purpoÅ¿e, to make them the more Å¿olid and laÅ¿ting; and finally, as if they were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48210:47"/>
Å¿o many Å¿eparate <hi>Gardens,</hi> they muÅ¿t be accompany'd with Walks of a breadth proportion'd to their length, as we Å¿hall declare in the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>To end this matter, I am only to add, that the little Walls may Å¿erve for very good <hi>Wall-Fruit,</hi> the ExpoÅ¿ure being good, or elÅ¿e for <hi>Rasberry-buÅ¿hes, Goosberry Shrubs,</hi> or <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> the ExpoÅ¿ure Å¿tanding <hi>Northward;</hi> the Å¿mall Banks will not be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s neither, on the contrary, lying to the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> they may be uÅ¿eful for Spring <hi>Plants,</hi> as Winter <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, PeaÅ¿e, Beans, Strawberries, Artichokes,</hi> &amp;c. and after the Spring they may be us'd for <hi>Purcelane, BaÅ¿il,</hi> &amp;c. and if there be abundance of thoÅ¿e Banks well expos'd, a conÅ¿iderable part of them may always be employ'd in good <hi>Grapes,</hi> and other <hi>Fruits,</hi> as I have done in the King's <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> on certain Banks made on purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>When our Banks look to the <hi>North,</hi> they will be good all the Summer for <hi>Charvel,</hi> or elÅ¿e to Å¿ow things that muÅ¿t be TranÅ¿planted, as <hi>Lettuce, Succory, Cabbaget, Celery, &amp;c.</hi> Å¿ince there is no part of a <hi>Garden</hi> but may be uÅ¿eful for Å¿ome things or other.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e Banks require a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Precaution, which is not only to beat and trample them extream cloÅ¿e at the bottom at the time they are made; but eÅ¿pecially to keep the upper part of every Bank a little higher than the Neighbouring Alley to it, otherwiÅ¿e the Water running down from the Banks of the whole Terras, would Å¿oon ruin and demoliÅ¿h them; and, if notwithÅ¿tanding this Precaution, any accident Å¿hould befal it, it muÅ¿t of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity be repair'd in the Winter, by adding Å¿ome <hi>Earth</hi> to it, which muÅ¿t be well tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and beaten anew, leaving only three or four Inches of good <hi>Earth</hi> looÅ¿e on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, which muÅ¿t be afterwards cultivated, in order to make that Place fit for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                        <p>And whereas I do not expect that the great Inequalities of <hi>Gardens</hi> Å¿hould be abÅ¿olutely levell'd, I would have little Fences made from Å¿pace to Å¿pace in the Alleys or Walks, to turn the Water of great Showers into the adjacent Squares or Plats; which Fences muÅ¿t be made with boards Å¿tuck into the Ground a-croÅ¿s the Walks, about two or three Inches above the Surface of the Walks; and in caÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Fences or Stays Å¿hould not prove Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I would have a drein made at the lower end of every <hi>Garden</hi> for the disburthening of thoÅ¿e Waters; or at leaÅ¿t, the Neighbourhood not allowing this diÅ¿charge, I would have a great hole made (that is a kind of Well) in ones own Ground, fill'd with dry Bricks; for thoÅ¿e Waters to loÅ¿e themÅ¿elves in, otherwiÅ¿e few Walls would be able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t long againÅ¿t great Inundations without demoliÅ¿hing, and conÅ¿equently, without cauÅ¿ing great diÅ¿orders.</p>

                           <p>Of the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition or DiÅ¿tribution of the whole Ground of every <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TWO particular ConÅ¿iderations are to be had in relation to every <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden:</hi> The firÅ¿t is to order that <hi>Garden</hi> Å¿o, that it may be uÅ¿eful and abounding in its Production proportionably to its Extent, and the goodneÅ¿s of the Ground.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd ConÅ¿ideration is to order it Å¿o, that it may be agreeable to the Eye, and convenient either for Walks, or Culture, and for Gathering, thoÅ¿e being the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ends propos'd in the making of it, to which end it is not only Å¿ufficient to know what the <hi>Earth</hi> is capable of doing of it Å¿elf without much help, but alÅ¿o what it is capable of performing without Å¿uch and Å¿uch helps it may receive.</p>
                        <p>To attain the firÅ¿t Point, which is the advantage of its Productions, the beÅ¿t parts of the <hi>Garden</hi> muÅ¿t be employ'd with all the Occonomy and Prudence that can be, with <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Seeds,</hi> inÅ¿omuch that no part thereof may remain uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, putting into each Å¿uch things as are moÅ¿t proper to Å¿ucceed in them; and to attain the Å¿econd, which is Beauty and Convenience, the Ground muÅ¿t not only be agreeably diÅ¿tributed into Squares or Plats, but the Walks muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be made very neat, well plac'd, and of a Å¿uitable Å¿ize, to the extent of the Ground, or Place, it being moÅ¿t certain, that no Intelligent Man will make a <hi>Garden</hi> without convenient Walks, which muÅ¿t be Å¿uited both as to Å¿ize and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the largeneÅ¿s or Å¿cantineÅ¿s thereof.</p>
                        <p>What we call the beÅ¿t parts of a <hi>Garden</hi> are really thoÅ¿e which have the beÅ¿t Ground, in caÅ¿e, as it commonly happens, it be not equally good all over, as it were to be wiÅ¿h'd; but the goodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Earth</hi> being equal, the beÅ¿t parts or places of a <hi>Garden</hi> are thoÅ¿e par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that are moÅ¿t Å¿helter'd from the Wind, and conÅ¿equently receive moÅ¿t benefit by the Reflexion caus'd by the Walls.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48210:48"/>
By neceÅ¿Å¿ary well-plac'd Walks or Allys, we mean Å¿uch as are commonly neceÅ¿Å¿ary either near the Walls, in order to Å¿ee the <hi>Trees,</hi> the better, to cultivate them with more eaÅ¿e, and have the convenience of gathering the <hi>Fruit;</hi> or in the whole body of the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> to divide the Ground in equal Squares, and to multiply the pleaÅ¿ure of Variety in Walking, to Å¿ee and viÅ¿it what thoÅ¿e Plats or Squares contain, as alÅ¿o that the Culture of them may be perform'd with more eaÅ¿e and convenience by the <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, as I have already Å¿aid, in our diÅ¿tribution we ought to look at once for the advantage of Production, and the Convenience of <hi>Culture</hi> of Walking.</p>
                        <p>As for the advantage of Production we will certainly find it, if, in the firÅ¿t place, we plant good <hi>Trees</hi> againÅ¿t all the Walls, even Å¿ometimes, without excepting the Face of the HouÅ¿e, eÅ¿pecially, in a Å¿mall <hi>Garden,</hi> planting <hi>Dwarfs</hi> alÅ¿o round about the Squares, inÅ¿tead of the Counter <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or <hi>Polehedges</hi> that were formerly in uÅ¿e, but are now aboliÅ¿h'd, by reaÅ¿on that the keeping of them in good order was very troubleÅ¿om, and their Productions very InconÅ¿iderable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will find thoÅ¿e Advantages, if our Squares are garniÅ¿h'd with uÅ¿eful Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, at a convenient diÅ¿tance from thoÅ¿e <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and finally, if the Body of every Square be continually fill'd with good <hi>Legumes,</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that thoÅ¿e of one SeaÅ¿on be no Å¿ooner gather'd or pick'd, than the <hi>Earth</hi> be again prepar'd to receive others for, or of, another SeaÅ¿on.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Part of this TreatiÅ¿e will Å¿hew what <hi>Trees</hi> will be proper to plant in all kind of <hi>Gardens,</hi> either for <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-Standards;</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> will Å¿hew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Cultivating</hi> and <hi>Pruning</hi> of them; and the <hi>Sixth,</hi> which contains the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> will Å¿hew which are the Bordures I call uÅ¿eful, and which the <hi>Legumes</hi> of every SeaÅ¿on, together with the <hi>Culture</hi> that is proper for them, in order to be fine, good and Å¿eaÅ¿onable.</p>
                        <p>It is not Å¿ufficient to have Å¿et down in general, what relates to the Advantages of the Production, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e declare what relates to the Conveniences of <hi>Culture,</hi> and the PleaÅ¿ure of Walking; therefore we are now to regulate the Å¿pace that is to be allow'd before the <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> or flat Bordures, when any are made; to regulate the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Squares, and finally the place and breadth of the Walks of every <hi>Garden,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Å¿ize it be of.</p>
                        <p>When I Å¿hall Å¿peak here of the Allies or Walks, I only mean the place deÅ¿tin'd for Walking, and nothing elÅ¿e, as Å¿ome do, who in their DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition give the name of Walks to all the Space that lies from the Wall to the Dwarfs of the <hi>Counter EÅ¿palier</hi> or <hi>Polehedge,</hi> or the DiÅ¿tance that lies from one <hi>Dwarf</hi> to another in the DiviÅ¿ion of the Squares or Ground Plats: This Space of Walks muÅ¿t never be narrower than five or Å¿ix Foot, though the <hi>Garden</hi> be never Å¿o Å¿mall, and ought Å¿eldom to exceed Eighteen or Twenty, though the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> be never Å¿o large. This is what I had to Å¿ay, as to the breadth, with this ProviÅ¿o, That in the firÅ¿t place every Walk muÅ¿t be more or leÅ¿s broad in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its length; and, in the Å¿econd place, that it muÅ¿t always be kept very Å¿mooth and gravell'd, and as firm as can be under Foot, otherwiÅ¿e it would not be convenient for Walking.</p>
                        <p>It will not be improper to declare here wherein the Difference between a Walk and a Path conÅ¿iÅ¿ts: A Walk muÅ¿t be broad enough for two PerÅ¿ons to walk a-breaÅ¿t at leaÅ¿t, and therefore cannot be allow'd leÅ¿s than five or Å¿ix Foot; without which it would no longer be a real Walk, but a large Path; and, as to Paths, provided one perÅ¿on can go through them they are large enough, and therefore do not require above a Foot, or a Foot and a half at moÅ¿t in breadth.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition or DiÅ¿tribution of a very Å¿mall <hi>Garden.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Proceed now to the particulars of every <hi>Garden,</hi> and Å¿ay, That commonly there are but few <hi>Gardens</hi> that have not at leaÅ¿t five or Å¿ix Fathom in breadth, with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable length, Å¿ince the name of <hi>Garden</hi> could hardly be beÅ¿tow'd upon a narrower place; but however, whatever it be, it is certain, that Å¿uch a place being well Å¿ituated, that is, in the Face of the HouÅ¿e, is a great Ornament to it, whether immediately joining to it, or divided by Å¿ome Å¿mall Yard. In caÅ¿e then of Å¿uch a Å¿mall <hi>Garden,</hi> in my Opinion, in order to manage the <hi>Ground</hi> to the beÅ¿t Advantage, the Entrance muÅ¿t be made in the midÅ¿t of that breadth, with a Walk of about Å¿ix Foot, which muÅ¿t be the only Walk, leaving only Å¿mall Paths along the Walls and Bordures, about a Foot broad; and in caÅ¿e the Entrance Å¿hould chance to be at one of the Corners, as Å¿ometimes one is neceÅ¿Å¿itated to make it, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be Å¿atisfied with one Walk along the firÅ¿t Wall which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ents it Å¿elf at that Corner; this Walk may chance to have the Sun one part of the Day, and be Å¿haded the reÅ¿t, whereby it will be Å¿ometimes pleaÅ¿ant for walking.</p>
                        <p>If Å¿uch a <hi>Garden</hi> being five or Å¿ix Fathom broad, Å¿hould happen to be as long again, it may very well be order'd, Å¿o as to contrive at every End, or, at leaÅ¿t, at one of them a Walk of an equal breadth with the former, eÅ¿pecially at that end which is neareÅ¿t to the HouÅ¿e, in which CaÅ¿e this walk may be allow'd a little more breadth than the other, which is an ObÅ¿ervation the Practice whereof is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary in all kind of <hi>Gardens,</hi> eÅ¿pecially great ones, to the end, that as it is cuÅ¿tomary to Å¿top at the Entrance of a <hi>Garden;</hi> to conÅ¿ider it, a place may be found at firÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿ably large, and conÅ¿equently agreeable and airy: ThoÅ¿e Walks at the ends will afford room for two or three diÅ¿terent or Å¿eparate Companies, which is a thing to be wiÅ¿h'd for.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides this, I would have the Walks that are along the <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or Walls, at leaÅ¿t at three or four Foot diÅ¿tance from the Walls, that the <hi>Trees</hi> may have at leaÅ¿t three or four Foot of <hi>Cultivated Earth,</hi> whereas their former allowance was not near Å¿o conÅ¿iderable, by which means this Bank being pretty large, as I would have it for all <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> even Å¿o as to make it yet much larger, in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> will not only be better nouriÅ¿h'd, but yet, beÅ¿ides the Bordures which Å¿upport the <hi>Earth,</hi> and form an agreeable Figure in <hi>Gardens,</hi> Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e uÅ¿eful <hi>Plants</hi> that delight in the Neighbourhood of Walls, may be planted in them; I mean Å¿uch as love to be Å¿helter'd from cold dangerous Winds, which is a thing altogether neceÅ¿Å¿ary in order to have Å¿omething in the <hi>Spring.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I DeÅ¿ire every Body to reflect upon this Article, in which I adviÅ¿e them to place the Walks at a pretty diÅ¿tance from the <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> or Walls, by reaÅ¿on of the Advantages that may accrue from the Å¿helter of the Walls, which Å¿helter is of no uÅ¿e when it only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours Walks, which receive no benefit by it; for, in fine, what Inconvenience can attend the <hi>Cultivating</hi> of three or four Foot more to the right or left of the Walk, in reÅ¿pect to the good uÅ¿e that is to be made of the <hi>Mould</hi> of every <hi>Garden,</hi> whereas the three or four Foot I cauÅ¿e to be added to the Å¿mall Bank, to which <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> were commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, will be much more profitable in that place, than if being imploy'd to Å¿ome part of the Walk, an equal quantity to it were <hi>Cultivated</hi> on the other Å¿ide of that Walk, by reaÅ¿on that it could not enjoy the benefit of the Å¿helter of the Wall.</p>
                        <p>I will not abÅ¿olutely decide, whether <hi>Dwarf Fruit-Trees</hi> ought to be planted in very Å¿mall <hi>Gardens,</hi> every Man is free in that to follow his own Inclination, though, in my Opinion, it were beÅ¿t to have none, unleÅ¿s they were Å¿mall <hi>Paradice Apple-Trees</hi> or <hi>GooÅ¿eberry</hi> Shrubs; I Å¿hould fear thoÅ¿e <hi>Dwarfs</hi> might grow Å¿o large as to offuÅ¿cate or Å¿hadow the <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> or <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> which I have a particular reÅ¿pect for in this Place; beÅ¿ides, they would certainly be inconvenient for walking, and take away the Beauty and PleaÅ¿ure of the Walk, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording it room to breathe in.</p>

                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48210:49"/>
Therefore I would employ the Å¿mallneÅ¿s of my <hi>Ground</hi> in other Things than <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> for InÅ¿tance, in <hi>Strawberries, Sallads</hi> and <hi>Pot-herbs, &amp;c.</hi> or elÅ¿e one part one way, and the reÅ¿t of another, to have Å¿ome little thing or other to pick at all times; and thus the whole Å¿pace of our little <hi>Garden,</hi> of which we have divided the breadth by one only Walk in the middle, or made it narrower by a walk along one of the Walls or <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> Å¿hould be cut croÅ¿s-wiÅ¿e by Beds about five or Å¿ix Foot broad, with Å¿everal Å¿mall Paths.</p>
                        <p>After having maturely examin'd the diÅ¿tribution I have now made, I find it Å¿o reaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I would make no other, though it were for a <hi>Garden</hi> of Å¿even or eight Fathom broad, nay, not even of thoÅ¿e that conÅ¿iÅ¿t of eight or nine.</p>

                        <p>BUT if it were for a <hi>Garden</hi> of ten to eleven, or eleven to twelve Fathom, which compoÅ¿es a <hi>Garden</hi> of a moderate Å¿ize, whether it has been thought fit in regard to its Situation, to place the Entrance of it at the middle, or elÅ¿e at one of the Å¿ides; in both CaÅ¿es I would allow the Walks Å¿even Foot in breadth, nay, I would even allow eight or nine to that which is parallel to the Front of the HouÅ¿e, leaving, as I have already Å¿aid, a Bank of about five or Å¿ix foot for every Wall; Å¿o that in Å¿uch a DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition I Å¿hould only make Walks along all the Walls: and thus there would remain in the midÅ¿t of the <hi>Garden</hi> a Å¿quare about Å¿ix or Å¿even Fathom broad, or from Å¿even to eight upon the whole length, and if that length Å¿hould chance to be about fifteen or twenty, or more, it would be fit to divide it into two equal parts by a Walk partly like that of the <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or Walls; but I would not allow it above three Foot, that Square not being above ten or twelve Fathom long.</p>
                        <p>Now the MaÅ¿ter might follow his own Inclination as to the imploying of that Square, either altogether in <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> planted in equal diÅ¿tances, with <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and Å¿ome Å¿mall <hi>Legumes</hi> among them, only for the Å¿pace of five or Å¿ix years, while the <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> Å¿hould be growing; or elÅ¿e to employ it part in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> that is upon the edge of the Walks, always obÅ¿erving the diÅ¿tance I have heretofore mention'd, and the reÅ¿t in <hi>Sallads, Greens, Artichokes</hi> and <hi>Strawberries,</hi> which is what I Å¿hould like beÅ¿t, or elÅ¿e I might imploy the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theÅ¿t part from the HouÅ¿e wholly in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and the other in <hi>Legumes,</hi> every one of them having Å¿even or eight Fathom in length to the breadth propos'd.</p>

                           <p>Of the DiÅ¿tribution or DiÅ¿poÅ¿ure of a <hi>Garden</hi> from fifteen to twenty Fathom in breadth, and one of five and twenty to thirty, and from thirty to forty.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Proceed now to a Place from fifteen to twenty Fathom breadth, upon any length whatever, which I look upon as a fine <hi>Garden;</hi> and, in the firÅ¿t Place, I will examin whether that <hi>Garden</hi> joyns the HouÅ¿e, or not; Å¿econdly, Whether the HouÅ¿e be built with Free-Å¿tone, or only with a ragged Stone plaiÅ¿ter'd over, or new pargetted.</p>
                        <p>The HouÅ¿e not joyning to the <hi>Garden, Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be planted againÅ¿t all the Walls, the <hi>Garden</hi> being altogether inclos'd; nay, even though it were adjoyning, the Front being only plaiÅ¿ter'd, or new pargetted; the Å¿ame may be done, eÅ¿pecially to have the benefit of the breadth and of the height of the Å¿pace that lyes between the Windows, as well as of the lower part of the Windows; but if the Architecture be fine and rich, I would leave it naked and expos'd to the Eye of every body, Å¿ince it would be a pitty to hide Å¿o fine an Ornament, through the hope of a little more <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Å¿uch a Place then, having fifteen or twenty Fathom in breadth, the length containing twenty five or thirty, I would have the Walks along the Walls eight or nine foot broad, nay, nine or ten, or more, the length amounting to five and thirty, or forty; and the Walk which offers it Å¿elf at the Entrance, and is parallel to the Front of the HouÅ¿e, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48210:49"/>
length the <hi>Garden</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of, I would allow five or Å¿ix foot more than the reÅ¿t, nay, it might be allow'd twelve or more, it being a Terras, as it happens Å¿ometimes, Å¿ince the TerraÅ¿Å¿es adjoyning to a I louÅ¿e can hardly ever be too broad.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides the Walks we have mention'd round about our <hi>Garden,</hi> there Å¿hould be another in the middle to divide the breadth in two equal parts, and the breadth containing twenty Fathom, or a little more, it might be allow'd four or five foot more than thoÅ¿e that are Parallel to the Walls to the right and left, eÅ¿pecially this Walk fronting the entrance of the HouÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>As to the length of our <hi>Garden,</hi> which we Å¿uppoÅ¿e to be from thirty to forty Fathom, it muÅ¿t be divided in two by a croÅ¿s Walk, almoÅ¿t about the Å¿ame breadth with thoÅ¿e of the Å¿ides, or only Å¿ome feet leÅ¿s, conÅ¿idering the Extent is not Å¿o great, beÅ¿ides that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is cloÅ¿er by the <hi>Trees</hi> that edge it to the right and left, than thoÅ¿e of its Å¿ides, which being favour'd by the Banks, have more Air than that of the middle.</p>
                        <p>Such a Walk croÅ¿s-wiÅ¿e will form two Squares, which may have each about Å¿ix or Å¿even Fathom one way to nine, ten, or twelve on the other.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon I think it proper to Å¿ay that a Square in any <hi>Garden</hi> whatever, always looks Å¿ine, when it conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of twelve or thirteen Fathom in length, and Å¿ix, Å¿even, or eight in breadth; and conÅ¿equently much more when it is in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure equal on all Å¿ides, and eÅ¿pecially when it is a little longer than broad.</p>
                        <p>If it Å¿hould happen at any time that going about to make a Walk on one of the Å¿ides of the <hi>Garden,</hi> one Å¿hould meet with a Wall, which inÅ¿tead of being Å¿trait, Å¿hould chance to be on a crooked Line in part of its extent, in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, in which we muÅ¿t not pretead to correct that defect abÅ¿olutely, I am of Opinion Å¿till to make the Walk regular with Å¿trait Angels, that is, Å¿quare, beginning it at four foot diÅ¿tance from that part of the Wall which advances moÅ¿t into the Walk, and making it Square on the Extremity where it is to end, it Å¿hall be garniÅ¿h'd to the right and left with fine Bordures that Å¿hall mark it; and as for thoÅ¿e parts which Å¿hall chance to be much broader with <hi>Earth</hi> than they Å¿hould be according to our uÅ¿ual DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, it may be imploy'd uÅ¿efully either in <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> or other <hi>Plants,</hi> that are not capable to offuÅ¿cate the <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are Å¿ometimes lengths of three or fourÅ¿core Fathom, and even more to eighteen or twenty in breadth, which we are Å¿peaking of, in which caÅ¿e that length muÅ¿t needs be divided into three or four equal Portions by croÅ¿s Walks; and whereas Å¿uch a length bears no Proportion to the breadth, I would Å¿top the ProÅ¿pect of our <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> within forty or fifty Fathom from the HouÅ¿e by Å¿ome Wall, or, at leaÅ¿t, by Å¿ome Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿ade; Å¿uch a Wall might be proper to multiply the <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or <hi>Wall-Fruit,</hi> or that Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ade for <hi>Grapes,</hi> or other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and thus we Å¿hould gain on all Å¿ides, either as to the Advantage of Production, or the PleaÅ¿ure of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>Although the Å¿pace of a <hi>Garden</hi> Å¿hould contain five and twenty, thirty, or thirty five Fathom in breadth, I would make no other diÅ¿tribution of it, than what we have already made to a breadth of fifteen or twenty, unleÅ¿s it were to make the Walks Å¿omewhat broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in proportion to their length.</p>

                        <p>IF the breadth of Å¿uch a <hi>Garden</hi> Å¿hould amount to threeÅ¿core, threeÅ¿core and ten, or fourÅ¿core Fathom, or more; I would divide it into four equal Portions, as I have done at <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> and in Å¿everal other <hi>Kitchen-Gardens;</hi> or elÅ¿e I would make Counter-Walks garniÅ¿h'd with <hi>Dwarfs</hi> upon the flat Bordures, as I have done at <hi>Rambouillet</hi> for his Grace the Duke of <hi>MontauÅ¿ier,</hi> upon condition that in thoÅ¿e two CaÅ¿es the two Walks pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Chief, which we Å¿uppoÅ¿e in the middle, about three Fathom broad, Å¿hould not be allow'd above eight or nine foot: In my Opinion, it were a pitty to make them broader, Å¿ince that would employ too much Ground in Walks.</p>
                        <p>We have already mention'd the bigneÅ¿s the Squares of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t of, and thus without repeating it, we will find that thoÅ¿e two Walks will afford us fine ones, either as to their breadth or length; for the Å¿ame Rule we preÅ¿cribe for the dividing of the breadth, muÅ¿t Å¿erve for the diviÅ¿ion of the length, and we muÅ¿t needs be perÅ¿uaded at all times that when a Å¿pace of <hi>Garden</hi> approaches fourÅ¿core Fathom

                        <p>ALthough this <hi>Culture</hi> taken in the whole, contains all what we have Explain'd in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular TreatiÅ¿es, my Intention, notwithÅ¿tanding, is to reduce it here to Three Things only: <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> to the <hi>Tillage</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> Å¿tands in need of; <hi>Secondly,</hi> to the NeatneÅ¿s <hi>Gardens</hi> require at all times.

                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore we muÅ¿t conclude, that as the <hi>Earth,</hi> as often as it is hot and moiÅ¿t, always finds it Å¿elf in an approaching diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to Act, that is, of producing Å¿ome <hi>Plants</hi> good or bad, and Å¿ometimes of no uÅ¿e for Man, becauÅ¿e it can, as it were, never remain Idle, the <hi>Production</hi> it makes of one thing, muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be prejudicial to another.</p>
                        <p>The ReaÅ¿on is, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> that the Interior Salt of it; that is, its Fertility, or Capacity of Acting is no wiÅ¿e Infinite, and is exhauÅ¿ted by often producing, as every Body knows: So that Å¿everal <hi>Plants</hi> lying near one another, it always happens that all, or a great part of them grow the Å¿maller, becauÅ¿e that which was to Å¿erve for the NouriÅ¿hment of all, being divided into many, the Å¿hare of each muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be the Å¿maller, and the NouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all of them the Å¿lenderer, or elÅ¿e it happens that Å¿ome of them being more lively, either by being grown Naturally, or being of a Temper more Å¿uitable to that part of the <hi>Earth</hi> which nouriÅ¿hes them; this <hi>Plant</hi> has Å¿uck'd a greater quantity of the NouriÅ¿hment that was in that Place ready prepar'd for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> than any of the reÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>It is not only the InÅ¿ide of that <hi>Earth</hi> which appears exhauÅ¿ted to us in its <hi>Productions,</hi> when too great a quantity of different <hi>Plants</hi> have exhauÅ¿ted it by their <hi>Roots;</hi> we Å¿ay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, that this <hi>Earth</hi> is dry and wants MoiÅ¿ture, when it is hindred from receiving the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Night-Dews, and of thoÅ¿e Å¿mall Show'rs which have the Gift of repairing and amending that <hi>Earth,</hi> provided they may be able to penetrate to the Internal Parts; thus when the <hi>Leaves</hi> of all thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants,</hi> which cover the <hi>Ground,</hi> come to receive thoÅ¿e kind of MoiÅ¿tures, they hinder them from deÅ¿cending lower, and Å¿o they remain expos'd to the <note place="margin">Exigua tantum gelidus ros no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte reponet. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that when we would have our <hi>Trees,</hi> and particularly our <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Tall Standards</hi> well fed, and conÅ¿equently very Vigorous, and thereby agreeable to Å¿ight, we muÅ¿t take care.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It muÅ¿t be noted next, that in all likelihood the CauÅ¿e or Motive of <hi>Tillage,</hi> is not only to make the <hi>Earths</hi> appear more agreeable to Å¿ight, though they really thereby become Å¿o; but that it is, in the firÅ¿t place, to render Å¿uch eaÅ¿ie as are not Å¿o, or to preÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e in a good CaÅ¿e that are Å¿o naturally; and, in the Å¿econd place, that it is chiefly thereby to augment Fertility in Å¿uch <hi>Earths</hi> as have but little, or to preÅ¿erve it in Å¿uch as have a Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Store: <hi>Earths</hi> that are abÅ¿olutely barren, muÅ¿t not be <hi>Till'd.</hi>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>And when I Å¿peak of endeavouring to give FruitfulneÅ¿s, I mean, that the <hi>Tillage</hi> muÅ¿t <note place="margin">Optima putri arva Å¿olo; id venti curant, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidaeque pruinae, &amp; labefacta mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, robuÅ¿tus jugera foÅ¿Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>r. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> contribute to give a temper of Heat and MoiÅ¿ture to a <hi>Soil,</hi> that is already provided with that Salt, it Å¿tands in need of for the chief part of Fertility; this temper of Heat and MoiÅ¿ture being Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the <hi>Earth,</hi> that without it its Salt is altogether uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it can produce no manner of <hi>Plants,</hi> in the Å¿ame manner as <hi>Animals</hi> can enjoy no perfect Health, without the temper of Elemental Qualifications.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>From what I have Å¿aid heretofore to favour the NouriÅ¿hment of our <hi>Trees,</hi> it follows, that I condemn thoÅ¿e who <hi>Sow</hi> or <hi>Plant,</hi> either many <hi>Pot-herhs,</hi> or <hi>Strawberries,</hi> or <hi>Flowers,</hi> near the Foot of their <hi>Trees,</hi> Å¿uch <hi>Plants</hi> being certainly very prejudicial to them.</p>
                        <p>The Rule I PractiÅ¿e for the <hi>Culture</hi> or <hi>Tillage,</hi> that is to be perform'd about our <hi>Trees,</hi> as well in the Winter as in the Spring, in dry light <hi>Earths,</hi> is to allow them a large one at the Entrance of the Winter, and the like as Å¿oon as it is paÅ¿t, to the end that the Rains and Snows of the Winter, and the Rains of the Spring, may eaÅ¿ily penetrate into our <hi>Earth;</hi> and as for the Å¿trong and moiÅ¿t <hi>Earths,</hi> I give them a Å¿mall <hi>Tillage</hi> in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> only to remove the Weeds, and tarry to give them a large one at the end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> when the <hi>Fruit</hi> is abÅ¿olutely knit, and the great MoiÅ¿tures over; thus the Surface of that <hi>Earth</hi> being kept hard, firm and cloÅ¿e, has left but little paÅ¿Å¿age for the Waters of the Winter and Spring, which we have no occaÅ¿ion here, for the Snow being melted, without having been capable of penetrating, remains part upon the Surface, where it is converted into Vapors, and the reÅ¿t following the Declivities of the Place, deÅ¿cends into the Neighbouring Rivers.</p>
                        <p>I muÅ¿t needs Å¿ay, in this Place, that nothing moiÅ¿tens Å¿o much, and penetrates Å¿o far as the Water of melted Snow. I have Å¿eldom known Water to penetrate above a foot deep, whereas the Water of Snow will penetrate two or three Foot, as well becauÅ¿e it is heavier than common Rain Water, as by reaÅ¿on, that as it melts Å¿lowly and by degrees, and from the undermoÅ¿t part of the MaÅ¿s of Snow, it Å¿oaks in with more eaÅ¿e, without being hindred by the Wind, or by the heat of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as much as I dread abundance of Snow upon Å¿trong, moiÅ¿t Grounds, and cauÅ¿e it to be remov'd from about our <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> I like it, and cauÅ¿e it to be gather'd in dry <hi>Earths,</hi> there to make a kind of Magazine of MoiÅ¿ture; and eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e

                           <hi>Earths</hi> I cauÅ¿e that which lyes, and is of no uÅ¿e, in the Walks, to be taken up and thrown into the <hi>Bordures</hi> of the <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and particularly to the ExpoÅ¿itions of the <hi>South,</hi> which in the Summer time want moÅ¿t moiÅ¿ture; and the Å¿ame into the ExpoÅ¿ures of the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> even in Å¿trong <hi>Earths,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that the Summer Showrs Å¿eldom falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the ground of thoÅ¿e ExpoÅ¿itions remains commonly dryer than the reÅ¿t, and conÅ¿equently the <hi>Trees</hi> are thereby expos'd to Å¿uffer.</p>
                        <p>This NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of <hi>Tillage,</hi> which I recommend and adviÅ¿e, is Å¿ometimes contradicted by the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of certain <hi>Trees,</hi> which being cover'd with Pavement or beaten Gravel about the <hi>Foot,</hi> do notwithÅ¿tanding thrive well, though they are never <hi>Till'd;</hi> to which I have two things to Å¿ay in anÅ¿wer; the <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That as commonly Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> are plac'd under Spouts or Gutters, a great deal of Water falls upon them, which penetrating through the Crany's of the Pavement, or through the beaten Gravel, furniÅ¿hes a Å¿ufficient NouriÅ¿hment for the Roots.

                        </argument>
                        <p>AFTER having explain'd the Motive, UÅ¿e and Manner of <hi>Tillage,</hi> we muÅ¿t do the Å¿ame thing about Amendments, which are nothing but a bettering, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of <hi>Earth;</hi> we have already Å¿aid, that this Improvement might be done with all manner of <hi>Dung,</hi> of which we muÅ¿t now explain the Motive, UÅ¿e and Manner.</p>
                        <p>As to the Motive, it is likewiÅ¿e certain, that when we amend, or Dung the Ground, it is with an Intention of affording FruitfulneÅ¿s to that which wants it, that is, that which has many defects, and conÅ¿equently little DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition towards Production; or elÅ¿e to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve it when it has it, and might loÅ¿e it, unleÅ¿s it received from time to time Å¿ome neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary Reparations, according to the Productions we require of it, either beyond its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or conformably to its Power; and likewiÅ¿e to amend it more or leÅ¿s, according to its Temper, whether good or bad: For <hi>Example,</hi> There muÅ¿t be a great deal of Dung to produce <hi>Pot-herbs,</hi> which grow in a Å¿hort time abundantly, and Å¿ucceed each other quickly in a Å¿mall compaÅ¿s of Ground, which without that might grow barren; on the other hand, <hi>Trees</hi> require but little or none for their NouriÅ¿hment, by reaÅ¿on that being long a-growing, they make but inconÅ¿iderable Productions, compar'd to the Ground they take up: and <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> Though they remain long in one and the Å¿ame Place, yet by means of their <hi>Roots</hi> which Å¿tretch out to the right and left, they make a Å¿hift to pick up the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment that is proper for them, far and near: I add, that the <hi>Earth</hi> which has a great deal of FruitfulneÅ¿s in it Å¿elf, requires leÅ¿s than that which has but little; and <hi>Finally,</hi> Cold moiÅ¿t <hi>Earth</hi> requires more than thoÅ¿e that are hot and dry.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, and no body can be ignorant of it, the great defects of <hi>Earth</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, as I have already Å¿aid, either in too much moiÅ¿ture, which is commonly accompany'd with cold, and great ponderouÅ¿neÅ¿s, or elÅ¿e in too much drought, which is likewiÅ¿e regularly accompany'd with an exceÅ¿Å¿ive lightneÅ¿s, and a great DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition to parching; We like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e find that among the Dungs we may imploy, Å¿ome are too fat and cooling, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, the Dung of Oxen and Cows; and the other too hot and light, for <hi>Example,</hi> the Dung of Sheep, HorÅ¿es and Pidgeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whereas the Remedy muÅ¿t have Vertues oppoÅ¿ite or contrary to the DiÅ¿tempers it is to cure; we muÅ¿t imploy hot and dry Dungs in moiÅ¿t, cold, heavy <hi>Earth,</hi> in order to heat them, and make them lighter and eaÅ¿ier; and Oxen and Cow Dung in lean, dry, light <hi>Earths,</hi> to make them fatter, and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, thereby hindring the great parchings or droughts of the Spring, and the great heats of the Summer from drying them up with too much eaÅ¿e.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, our <hi>Ground,</hi> though good, not being permitted to produce, for InÅ¿tance, Å¿uch as are built upon; thoÅ¿e <hi>Grounds</hi> thus cover'd with Buildings, are, though againÅ¿t their Will, like a Rich Man who Å¿pends nothing, though able to Å¿pend much; they always remain, as the PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿ay, equally Fertile in Power, that is, equally capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and would actually produce, if they were not hindred from Å¿o doing; as to the others which produce at all times, if in <hi>Tilling</hi> of them, the <hi>Plants</hi> they had produc'd be again put underneath them, as it happens often, eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e parts that are the Seat of War; thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> thus put under the Surface of that <hi>Earth</hi> rot there, and Å¿erve to fatten it again to the Å¿ame degree it poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s'd before the producing of them, or elÅ¿e we may Å¿ay, that it is the Å¿ame Salt in <hi>Specie,</hi> which returns to it, and makes it as Rich, that is, as Fertile as it was before.</p>
                        <p>And when all the Productions of Å¿uch a Å¿pot of <hi>Ground</hi> are taken away, as it is very uÅ¿ual, and that in lieu thereof it be allow'd as many of the Productions of another place, and that by means of rotten Straw, Å¿eaÅ¿on'd, as it were, with the Excrements of Å¿ome Animals, which Excrements are likewiÅ¿e originally Å¿prung from the <hi>Earth,</hi> and make a part of it, that <hi>Earth</hi> having thereby repaired its loÅ¿s, becomes as Rich, that is, as Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile as before.</p>
                        <p>We may then in Å¿ome manner look upon Dungs in relation to <hi>Earth,</hi> as a kind of Coin which repairs the TreaÅ¿ures of that <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as there are Å¿everal kind of Coins, Å¿ome more precious, others leÅ¿s, but Å¿till, both the one and the other being Coin'd, paÅ¿s in Trade and Inrich; Å¿o there are Å¿everal kind of Dungs, Å¿ome a little better than others, but Å¿till all proper to amend, that is, to repair
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48210:52"/>
the loÅ¿s that <hi>Earth</hi> had Å¿uÅ¿tained in Producing; and thus the SubÅ¿tance of the <hi>Earth</hi> does not wear out to be at laÅ¿t reduc'd to nothing, or waÅ¿te Å¿o as to give cauÅ¿e to Å¿ay, that it diminiÅ¿hes, for if it did, where Å¿hould it be now, after having produc'd Å¿o much from the beginning of the World? 'Tis only the Salt of it that diminiÅ¿hes; or to Å¿peak more properly, changes place, which, as it may return, as it does, is capable of reÅ¿toring that <hi>Earth</hi> to the Å¿ame Condition it was in formerly.</p>
                        <p>The Alambicks in ChimiÅ¿try Å¿ufficiently manifeÅ¿t what that Salt is, and Å¿how in little what a Å¿mall quantity of it is required to animate a pretty conÅ¿iderable quantity of <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon which, I think I may Å¿ay, that Dung Å¿eems to be in relation to <hi>Earths</hi> that are of a different Temper, what Salt is in relation to different kinds of Meat, either Å¿uch as are fine and curious, as <hi>Partridges</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> and Å¿uch as are material and groÅ¿s, as <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Pork, &amp;c.</hi> theÅ¿e without doubt can bear a much larger quantity of Salt in the Å¿eaÅ¿oning of them, without Å¿poiling, than the others, Å¿ince a good piece of <hi>Beef,</hi> without doubt, requires a much greater quantity of Salt to reliÅ¿h it, than a piece of <hi>Mutton,</hi> though equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly large; and indeed groÅ¿s Meats are made more pallatable by being well poudred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Mutton</hi> being Å¿alted at the Å¿ame rate, would be Å¿poil'd.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides, as there are Å¿ome Salts that Å¿alt more, for InÅ¿tance, <hi>Bay-Salt,</hi> and others leÅ¿s, as white Salt; Å¿o as to the heating, or animating of <hi>Earth,</hi> there are Å¿ome Dungs which heat and amend more; for InÅ¿tance, thoÅ¿e of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>HorÅ¿es,</hi> and others that amend and heat leÅ¿s; for <hi>Example,</hi> The Dung of Hogs and Cows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muÅ¿t prudently make uÅ¿e both of the one and the other; Experience Å¿ufficiently juÅ¿tifies this faculty of heating in point of Dungs, in that a certain quantity of HorÅ¿e Dung heap'd up together will cauÅ¿e a conÅ¿iderable heat, even to that degree, as to convert it Å¿elf Å¿ometimes into real Fire, whereas a heap of Cow Dung never heats it Å¿elf to that degree.</p>
                        <p>And, therefore, Å¿hould a great deal of HorÅ¿e and Sheeps Dung be laid in light, Å¿andy <note place="margin">Arida tantum ne Å¿aturare fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo pingui pude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Å¿ola, &amp;c. <hi>Georg.</hi> 1.

                           <hi>Earths,</hi> which Å¿tand in no need of Å¿o much heat, it would prejudice them inÅ¿tead of doing them good; thoÅ¿e Dungs are too burning; but according to the Advice of the Poet, we might allow them a great deal of Cows-Dung, which is fatter, and not Å¿o hot: And on the contrary, what is not Å¿it for dry, hot <hi>Earths,</hi> is very proper for Å¿uch as are cold and moiÅ¿t; thoÅ¿e, which naturally produce but too many Weeds, want heat to be animated, as it were, to diÅ¿poÅ¿e them, to produce others that are better for us.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t Point, I cannot forbear Å¿aying, that <hi>Dung,</hi> being a vulgar thing, and Å¿o well known, it Å¿eems uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and almoÅ¿t ridiculous, to endeavour to give an account of it; but yet in order to continue to follow exactly the deÅ¿ign I have propos'd in this TreatiÅ¿e, which is not to omit the leaÅ¿t Å¿ingularity of all that belongs to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> I think my Å¿elf oblig'd to Å¿peak of this <hi>Dung,</hi> not indeed to make it known to Å¿uch as are unacquainted with it, Å¿ince it would be hard to meet with Å¿uch, but only to make Å¿ome ObÅ¿ervations upon it, which are very material for the matter in hand.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay then, that <hi>Dung</hi> is a CompoÅ¿ition of two things, of which, the firÅ¿t is a certain quantity of Straw which has Å¿erv'd for Litter for DomeÅ¿tick Animals; and the Å¿econd, the Excrements of Å¿ome Animals among it, which has in Å¿ome manner incorporated with that Straw; neither that Straw alone, though half rotten, is Å¿it to make good <hi>Dung;</hi> nor yet the Excrements of thoÅ¿e Animals without Straw, can be Å¿ufficient alone, to induce one to imploy them, they muÅ¿t of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity be mix'd together to be of uÅ¿e, which is a thing known by every body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48210:53"/>
Neither can any body be ignorant that thoÅ¿e who keep thoÅ¿e Animals both for PleaÅ¿ure and UÅ¿e, have particular Places for them to feed and reÅ¿t in; which Places have peculiar and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Names; they are call'd Stables for HorÅ¿es and Mules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Pens, Stalls and Sties for Oxen, Cows, Sheep and Hogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Great Hunters have, beÅ¿ides, Kennels for Hounds, but thoÅ¿e afford but little of what we treat of in this Chapter. It is uÅ¿ual to place daily under thoÅ¿e Animals, and particularly under HorÅ¿es, a Å¿ufficient quantity of freÅ¿h New Straw, well Å¿pread, which is call'd making of Litter, which is, as it were, a kind of Bed, which Å¿erves for them to lye upon, and take their reÅ¿t, when they are weary, to put themÅ¿elves again in a Condition to go about their uÅ¿ual Service a-new; this Litter Å¿erves then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve their Health, to help to recover their Vigor, as well as to keep them neater, and more agreeable to Å¿ight.</p>
                        <p>But that is not all, for after that it muÅ¿t be good for Å¿ome other thing; this Straw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus imploy'd by the Name of Litter, becomes not only bruis'd and broken by the Trampling and Agitation of thoÅ¿e Animals, but their Excrements having imbib'd or Å¿oak'd it, changes the colour of it, and half rots it, Å¿o that it becomes, as it were, of a different Nature from what it was; and being altogether corrupted, and no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Å¿erve for Litter, there is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of removing it, to put new into the room of it, which in its turn muÅ¿t undergo the Å¿ame Fate.</p>
                        <p>This firÅ¿t Litter being taken from under thoÅ¿e Animals, and laid aÅ¿ide, is not look'd upon as a heap of common Dirt, to be rejected, we give it the name of <hi>Dung,</hi> now in queÅ¿tion; and under that Name, it is found to be, not only a uÅ¿eful, but a very neceÅ¿Å¿ary thing for the good of Human kind.</p>
                        <p>Now that which is the CauÅ¿e of this new Service it yields, being grown <hi>Dung,</hi> is, that the Excrements of thoÅ¿e Animals have communicated unto it a certain quality, or rather a certain Salt, which being contain'd in it, cauÅ¿es it (being heapt up) to heat it Å¿elf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderably, and at the Å¿ame time to heat all that is round about it, as we Å¿hall explain more at large hereafter.</p>
                        <p>After having thus explain'd what <hi>Dung</hi> is, if it may be truly Å¿aid that that Explication was not very neceÅ¿Å¿ary, at leaÅ¿t it muÅ¿t be allow'd, that the other four Articles are very material to be explain'd, beginning by that which is to give us an Account how many Å¿orts of <hi>Dung</hi> we may uÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>It naturally follows from what I have Å¿aid above, that as there are many HorÅ¿es every where, there likewiÅ¿e is a great deal of HorÅ¿e <hi>Dung,</hi> and a little of Mules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there <note place="margin">The variety of <hi>Dungs.</hi>
                           </note> is a great deal of Cows, and that Sheep and Hogs afford a Å¿mall quantity, we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e Å¿ay that the Poultry that is kept in Å¿ome HouÅ¿es, as Pigions, Hens, GeeÅ¿e, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alÅ¿o produce Å¿ome Å¿mall manner of <hi>Dung,</hi> but it is Å¿o very inconÅ¿iderable, that it is hardly worth mentioning.</p>
                        <p>The great Animals in queÅ¿tion do not alone contribute by their Excrements, to the CompoÅ¿ition of <hi>Dungs,</hi> and the Amendments of the <hi>Earth,</hi> all the parts of their Bodies being once rotten, nay, their very Nails and Bones Å¿erve to fatten it. The Leaves of <hi>Trees</hi> which are gather'd in <hi>Autumn,</hi> being put in a moiÅ¿t Place, and eÅ¿pecially under the drein of a Stable or Pen, being alÅ¿o rotten, may likewiÅ¿e be of Å¿ome uÅ¿e in Places where Straw and Animals are not common.</p>
                        <p>The very AÅ¿hes of all combuÅ¿tible Matters are of a very good uÅ¿e in this CaÅ¿e, for the Å¿mall quantity that can be had of them, and not only AÅ¿hes, but alÅ¿o rotten Wood, and generally all things which being come out of the Earth, are corruptible, becomes <hi>Dung</hi> for the Ground, when put into it again, and there corrupts.</p>
                        <p>Nay, there are Å¿ome People, who, in order to multiply the number of <hi>Dungs</hi> or Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, maintain, that Turf, and the Earth of high Ways is proper for it; I will Å¿peak my Opinion of it in the Sequel, and will only Å¿ay in this Place, that that kind of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿h <hi>Earth</hi> which is met with in the Bowels of Å¿ome piece of Grounds, which we call Marle, and Å¿eems to be inclin'd to become Stones, muÅ¿t be conÅ¿ider'd as an amendment to help towards the Production of Å¿ome things, as I will explain in the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>Now we have explain'd the diverÅ¿ity of <hi>Dungs,</hi> it will be proper to Å¿ee what are their particular Qualifications, to the end that this knowledge may teach us to make a good <note place="margin">The choice of <hi>Dung.</hi>
                           </note> Choice according to the occaÅ¿ions we have for it.</p>
                        <p>There are two peculiar Properties in the CaÅ¿e of <hi>Dungs;</hi> the one is to fatten, that is, to fatten the <hi>Earth,</hi> and better it, or render it more fruitful, and that is common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Dung,</hi> being well rotten, only Å¿ome more, and others leÅ¿s: The Å¿econd Property is to produce a certain Å¿enÅ¿ible heat, capable of producing Å¿ome conÅ¿iderable Effect: The Ancients knew the firÅ¿t, and have not known the Å¿econd; this laÅ¿t is Å¿eldom met with in any but HorÅ¿e and Mule <hi>Dung,</hi> when newly made, and Å¿till a little moiÅ¿t, and indeed thoÅ¿e
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48210:53"/>
Å¿ort of <hi>Dungs</hi> are of a wonderful uÅ¿e in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> and particularly in the Winter; at which time they Å¿eem to perform the Office of the great Planet, which animates and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s all things, really performing there the Å¿ame Function which the heat of the Sun is us'd to diÅ¿penÅ¿e there in the Summer; as for InÅ¿tance, being laid in the form of Couches, it Å¿erves to afford us all the Novelties of the Spring, <hi>viz. Cowcumbers, RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> Å¿mall <hi>Sallads,</hi> and <hi>Melons,</hi> and all that, long before Nature can give it; it Å¿erves in great FroÅ¿ts to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h us with <hi>Greens</hi> and <hi>Flowers,</hi> and that which is yet more Å¿ingular, very green <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> and thoÅ¿e better than the Common ones; it likewiÅ¿e Å¿erves to advance conÅ¿iderably the Maturity of <hi>Strawberries,</hi> of <hi>Figs</hi> in CaÅ¿es, <hi>PeaÅ¿e, &amp;c.</hi> and finally, it Å¿erves to make MuÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms grow at all times.</p>
                        <p>And if new Dung has a peculiar GoodneÅ¿s and Faculty, when it Å¿tands poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s'd of its firÅ¿t heat, it has another when, without being Rotten, it is old and dry, the heat being altogether paÅ¿t, which is to preÅ¿erve againÅ¿t, or from, Cold, that which FroÅ¿ts might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage and deÅ¿troy; and therefore it is us'd in the Winter time to cover <hi>Fig-Trees, Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>This Amendment or Improvement Å¿uppoÅ¿es two conÅ¿iderable Conditions, the one rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the time which is proper for the doing of it, and the other to the manner of doing it well.</p>
                        <p>As to the time, we muÅ¿t not imagin that all the SeaÅ¿ons of the Year are proper to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <note place="margin">Proper times to turn <hi>Earth.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>It follows then, that the <hi>Winter</hi> is the only SeaÅ¿on fit for great Amendments; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves able <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> not to loÅ¿e a time which is Å¿o precious for their Occupation: In order to which, they need neither to mind the Quarters of the Moon, nor the Winds, whatever they be, notwithÅ¿tanding the Traditions of Å¿ome of the Ancients, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be Å¿aid in Å¿ome Books of <hi>Gard'ning;</hi> they are only troubleÅ¿om ObÅ¿ervations, and altogether UÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and are only proper to afford Matter towards the ImbelliÅ¿hment of Poetry, or, perhaps, to Å¿et off Å¿ome ViÅ¿ionary talkative <hi>Gard'ners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us now proceed to the manner of Employing this Dung to the purpoÅ¿e: This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought to afford us two InÅ¿tructions; the one is to point out thoÅ¿e Parts where the Dung is to be laid, and the Å¿econd to mark out partly the true quantity.</p>
                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t, it is to be noted, that Å¿ometimes there is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Dunging largely, and pretty deep into the Ground, and Å¿ometimes it Å¿uffices to turn the Surface lightly. As to the firÅ¿t, I am not of the Opinion of thoÅ¿e who make Beds of their Dung at the Bottom of Trenches, whatever care they take of Tilling every Bed largely, in order to mix the Earth and Dung together, and my ReaÅ¿on, confirm'd by a long Experience, is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good in that Dung, Å¿o employ'd, Å¿oon becomes UÅ¿eleÅ¿s, Å¿ince it paÅ¿Å¿es too low with the MoiÅ¿tures which force it along, and drive it to Å¿uch Parts where the <hi>Roots</hi> cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate, beÅ¿ides that the Motion which is made in Tilling thoÅ¿e Three or Four Beds in the Trenches, inÅ¿tead of contributing to make the Earth lighter; which is one of the <note place="margin">Et cui putre Å¿olum. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> moÅ¿t material Conditions, only preÅ¿Å¿es and hardens it by the Trampling, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided in Tilling.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as I have already Å¿aid elÅ¿ewhere, I would have the Dung uÅ¿ed for <hi>Earth,</hi> in the Å¿ame Manner as AÅ¿hes are us'd in WaÅ¿hing, that is, that whereas the AÅ¿hes are only laid upon the Surface of the Linen, that is heaped up in the Tub, in order to cleanÅ¿e it; Å¿o the Dung Å¿hould only be laid on the Surface of the <hi>Earth</hi> that is to be Amended. I Å¿ay
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48210:54"/>
it again, it is not the groÅ¿s SubÅ¿tance of the Dung which FertiliÅ¿es, as it is not the groÅ¿s SubÅ¿tance of the AÅ¿hes which cleanÅ¿es, it is that inviÅ¿ible Salt which is contain'd in thoÅ¿e Matters, Incorporating, wetted with the Waters that wet it, deÅ¿cends with them, whereever their Weight inclines them, and there produces what it is capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming.</p>
                        <p>But it is not Å¿ufficient to know the beÅ¿t Place where the Dung is to be laid, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e examine what quantity may be proper for it: In order to explain this Article, it is proper to know that as Å¿ome Dungs have a far greater quantity of Salt to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate than others; Å¿o there are <hi>Earths</hi> which require and want more Amendments than others: I Å¿till mean the <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> and not that <hi>Earth</hi> in which <hi>Trees</hi> are to be Planted; for I will have none for theÅ¿e, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing always that if they have the leaÅ¿t <note place="margin">No <hi>Dung</hi> for <hi>Trees.</hi>
                           </note> GoodneÅ¿s they have enough to NouriÅ¿h <hi>Trees,</hi> from which we expect Pallatable Fruit. He who Å¿tudies to make Excellent Wine, Å¿oon perceives that the uÅ¿e of Dung is directly contrary to his Intention, and that if thoÅ¿e Amendments augment the quantity, at the Å¿ame time it diminiÅ¿hes the Value, though perhaps that defect might have been corrected by Fermentation and Boiling; Therefore have we not yet much more cauÅ¿e to fear for the TaÅ¿te of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which, without the Advantages of Boiling, are to be tranÅ¿mitted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the <hi>Tree,</hi> to the Mouth?</p>
                        <p>And when the <hi>Earth</hi> is naught, I can not, as I have already Å¿aid, forbear blaming thoÅ¿e who loÅ¿e their Time in Planting there, inÅ¿tead of getting better <hi>Earth</hi> brought there, the quantity cannot be ConÅ¿iderable, nor conÅ¿equently the Charge, conÅ¿idering that none will go about to Plant many <hi>Trees</hi> in ill Grounds.</p>
                        <p>But if, contrary to my Sentiment in this particular CaÅ¿e of Planting of <hi>Trees,</hi> People will be obÅ¿tinate in dunging of Trenches, where they intend to Plant, I am willing to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Manner I think moÅ¿t proper for it, to Å¿ave Charges, and to have the Work better done and Å¿ooner.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, for InÅ¿tance, that a Trench Å¿ix Foot deep is to be prepar'd, either along a Wall to plant againÅ¿t it, or about a Square to plant <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> FirÅ¿t, I would have the quantity of Dung one has Examin'd, either HorÅ¿e or Cow Dung, which are the two Å¿orts that are moÅ¿t Commonly us'd, and which are moÅ¿t plentiful; this Knowledge will teach us whether we may uÅ¿e a great deal or not: After this I would have it laid in equal diÅ¿tances, all along the Trench that is to be made, and the overture of the Trench dug three Foot deep, and about a Fathom upon the breadth propos'd, Å¿o that before we go about to employ the Dung, we may have an empty free Space before us; I would likewiÅ¿e have three Men, two with Spades to Å¿tir the Ground, and one with a Pitch-fork for the Dung; and laÅ¿tly, I would have two of them take that <hi>Earth</hi> that is to be dug, and throw it at the farther End of the Empty Place; Å¿o that the height of the Trench may be fill'd, and that half a Foot higher than the adjacent Surface, taking care to place the <hi>Earth</hi> that lay on the Surface at the Bottom, to the end that the <hi>Earth</hi> which lay at the bottom, may in its turn become the Surface of the new Trench; this <hi>Earth</hi> Å¿o thrown, in the manner I mean, makes a natural Declivity, at the bottom of which all the Stones will fall by the Å¿ame means, which muÅ¿t be remov'd immediately; and while the two Men thus throw the <hi>Earth</hi> which forms this Declivity, I would have the third, who Å¿hall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining upon the edge of the Trench, to take the <hi>Dung</hi> with the Pitch-fork, and throw it without IntermiÅ¿Å¿ion, not into the bottom, but only upon the top of the Declivity in queÅ¿tion, and there Å¿pread it, that it may be Å¿o well diÅ¿pers'd, that no great quantity of it may lye together; by this means, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing always the Work-men act briskly, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand each other, two very material things are done at once, and in a Å¿mall time, with little Charge; the firÅ¿t is, that the <hi>Dung</hi> is plac'd and mix'd in the <hi>Earth</hi> as it Å¿hould be, and the Å¿econd, that this <hi>Earth</hi> being Å¿tirr'd from top to bottom, grows eaÅ¿ie and light, as it Å¿hould be.</p>
                        <p>I muÅ¿t not forget minding thoÅ¿e who dig along a Wall, to take care not to come too near the Foundations, for fear of indamaging it, the Wall might be in danger of falling; a Å¿mall Å¿lope of hard Ground muÅ¿t always be left untouched againÅ¿t it.</p>
                        <p>When beÅ¿ides the Trench for <hi>Trees,</hi> there are to be others round about all the Squares or Ground Plots deÅ¿tin'd for <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> in a <hi>Garden</hi> not having the good Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are to be wiÅ¿h'd for, the Å¿ame Method muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be us'd, multiplying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the number of thoÅ¿e that are to <hi>Till,</hi> proportioning the number of thoÅ¿e that are to Å¿pread the <hi>Dung</hi> accordingly; there muÅ¿t always be the Å¿ame depth of <hi>Earth,</hi> ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the firÅ¿t overture of the Trenches about a Fathom broad, it being for Example of the length of the whole Square, to which end the <hi>Earth</hi> that Å¿hall be taken out of the Trench, muÅ¿t be laid along the Square that is to be fill'd, which Å¿hall Å¿erve to fill up
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48210:54"/>
the Gage that Å¿hall lay empty at the end of the Å¿aid Square; in the mean time the Dung muÅ¿t be brought either in Baskets, hand-Barrows, or otherwiÅ¿e, into the Neighbourhood, or near that empty Place; and a Å¿ufficient number of People Å¿hall be imployed to Å¿pread it upon the top of the Å¿lopes, by degrees, as the others continually throw new <hi>Earth</hi> towards the empty Places.</p>
                        <p>I warrant that with Å¿uch a concert of Workmen, well skill'd in their Work, the Ground may be diÅ¿pos'd to produce very fine, and very good <hi>Legumes,</hi> care being taken finally to make an univerÅ¿al <hi>Tillage</hi> to render all the Surface even.</p>
                        <p>I would only have People obÅ¿erve, that in caÅ¿e the <hi>Earth</hi> which wants to be amended or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, is naturally dry and Å¿andy, fat Dung muÅ¿t be imploy'd, for Example, Cow-dung, or elÅ¿e HorÅ¿e-dung, which Å¿hall have been rotten in a MoriÅ¿h Place; I Å¿eldom mention the Dung of Hogs, becauÅ¿e, that beÅ¿ides its being Å¿carce, it has an ill Å¿avour, which hinders People from deÅ¿iring it, it is capable of infecting the Ground, and giving it an ill taÅ¿te, which would infect the <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿ooner than better it: When they are courÅ¿e, Å¿trong, moiÅ¿t <hi>Earths,</hi> the largeÅ¿t and dryeÅ¿t Dung will be moÅ¿t proper; for Example, HorÅ¿e and Mules Dung, never putting too much, nor too little, but a moderate quantity, exceÅ¿s being dangerous in theÅ¿e CaÅ¿es; on the other hand, putting none at all in the <hi>Earth</hi> in queÅ¿tion, is a defect that would Å¿oon be perceiv'd; as likewiÅ¿e putting but too Å¿mall a quantity, is a help, which not being Å¿ufficient, muÅ¿t be look'd upon as uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, eÅ¿pecially in lean <hi>Earths,</hi> from which more is requir'd than it is able to produce; that is, abundance of thick well fed <hi>Legumes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The moÅ¿t reaÅ¿onable meaÅ¿ure for imploying of that Dung, is to lay a Basket full, and that of a moderate Å¿ize, upon the length of every Fathom of Å¿lope, when it is about the thickneÅ¿s of a foot of <hi>Earth;</hi> and thus the length of twenty Fathom to the breadth of Å¿ix foot, and the depth of three, will conÅ¿ume Å¿ixÅ¿core Baskets full, of that moderate Å¿ize, that is, about Å¿uch a Å¿ize as a Woman may partly be able to carry.</p>
                        <p>And when there is not Dung enough to make the mixture I have explain'd here, the Å¿mall quantity there may be of it muÅ¿t only be Å¿pread upon the Surface, Å¿preading it with an even hand; after which <hi>Tilling</hi> it Å¿ufficiently about nine or ten Inches in depth, it muÅ¿t be buried Å¿o that it may no longer appear on the out-Å¿ide, and yet not Å¿o deep as to be out of the reach of the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Excrements of Sheep and Goats are very fit for that kind of Dung, and it will Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Å¿pread about two Inches thick of it, that Å¿mall quantity will contribute to amend the <hi>Earth</hi> as much as a greater of HorÅ¿e or Cow-dung.</p>
                        <p>And in truth, I look upon Sheeps-dung, as the beÅ¿t of Dungs, and that which has moÅ¿t diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to fertilize all manner of <hi>Earths;</hi> the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> will Å¿how more particularly how much I value it above all others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>La Poudrette,</hi> and the Dung of Pidgeons, and of Poultrey, may alÅ¿o make Å¿ome amendments, but yet I Å¿eldom uÅ¿e them, the one is too Å¿tinking, and pretty Å¿carce, the others are full of little Fleas, which Å¿ticking to the <hi>Plants,</hi> are very prejudicial to them.</p>
                        <p>As for the Excrements of Aquatick Animals, or Å¿uch as commonly live in Water, it is Å¿tark nought, as well as that which comes from Cunny Warrens, witneÅ¿s the Sterility that appears about the Clappers; the rotten Leaves of Plants occaÅ¿ion blackneÅ¿s and cold, which, far from amending, rots the new Plants, and therefore it muÅ¿t not be us'd at all.</p>
                        <p>The Leaves of <hi>Trees</hi> gather'd up, and rotten in Å¿ome moiÅ¿t Ground, become rather a kind of <hi>Soil</hi> than Dung, and are fitter to be Å¿pread to Å¿ecure the Earth from parching, than to fume the inÅ¿ide of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Terreau</hi> or <hi>Soil</hi> is the laÅ¿t Service we receive from Dung, the Dung having Å¿erv'd to make Couches, conÅ¿umes it Å¿elf to that degree, that it becomes a kind of <hi>Mould,</hi> which then is no longer employ'd like Dung to fatten, but like <hi>Earth</hi> which produces Å¿mall <hi>Plants,</hi> and Å¿o Å¿even or eight Inches of it is laid upon new Beds for <hi>Sallads, RaddiÅ¿hes</hi> and <hi>Legumes</hi> that are to be tranÅ¿planted, or to remain, as <hi>Melons, Comcumbers,</hi> hard <hi>Lettuce, &amp;c.</hi> and about two Inches thick of it is likewiÅ¿e laid over <hi>Earths</hi> new Å¿own at the Spring, and in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when they are too dry of themÅ¿elves, or inclin'd to harden and Å¿plit eaÅ¿ily by heat, the Seeds would dry up in the firÅ¿t, and could not penetrate the Surface of the other.</p>
                        <p>Therefore this <hi>Soil</hi> is us'd, which preÅ¿erving its MoiÅ¿ture occaÅ¿ion'd by <hi>Tillage,</hi> or Waterings, makes the Seeds riÅ¿e eaÅ¿ily, and Å¿hoot with SucceÅ¿s; beÅ¿ides, it has another property, which is, to hinder the Birds from picking off the new Seeds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48210:55"/>
AÅ¿hes of all kinds would be of great uÅ¿e to amend the <hi>Earth,</hi> if there was enough of it; but whereas we have but little of it, it is only us'd about the Feet of Å¿ome <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> or Å¿ome other <hi>Trees,</hi> where they are not uÅ¿eleÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>Some People have a particular Value for <hi>Turf</hi> to make Amendments, but I look upon it in a different Manner, that is, as being fit to produce of it Å¿elf, and not to Fertilize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Earth;</hi> and I have a great Value yet for the <hi>Earth</hi> that lies under that <hi>Turf</hi> which we call new <hi>Earth,</hi> the which having never been wrought, is conÅ¿equently full of all the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility that can be expected from New <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore happy are thoÅ¿e who can make whole <hi>Gardens</hi> of Å¿uch:</p>
                        <p>But when People have not a Å¿ufficient quantity to compaÅ¿s this, and yet have a reaÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Stock of it, I would have them employ it either wholly for <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> or, at leaÅ¿t, in the Å¿ame manner as I have caus'd Dungs to be Employ'd for deep <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                        </list>
                        <p>I dare not believe that their Opinion in relation to Dungs, extends to all <hi>Trees</hi> in General, Å¿ince every body knows that the <hi>Trees,</hi> of ForeÅ¿ts, thoÅ¿e in the open Fields, and thoÅ¿e that Å¿erve for Avenues to HouÅ¿es, thrive commonly very well without ever having been Dung'd: In caÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Gentlemen allow this to be true, as to <hi>Trees</hi> that bear no <hi>Fruit,</hi> they condemn themÅ¿elves unawares as to <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> Å¿ince both the one and the other receive their NouriÅ¿hment in one and the Å¿ame manner, that is, by their <hi>Roots;</hi> and indeed thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> working in a natural <hi>Ground,</hi> when it is paÅ¿Å¿ably good, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of finding enough of what is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them to live.</p>
                        <p>But however, in all probability, thoÅ¿e Gentlemen only apply the Maxim in queÅ¿tion to <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> and yet really I cannot believe, that they dare own that they mean all thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> in General, Å¿ince it would be ridiculous to Å¿ay, that one and the Å¿ame thing can be equally good; for Å¿o many <hi>Trees</hi> of Å¿uch different ConÅ¿titutions, Å¿ome more or leÅ¿s Vigorous, and others more or leÅ¿s Infirm; Å¿ome Kernel, and Å¿ome Stone <hi>Fruit, &amp;c.</hi> and yet they have never Explain'd themÅ¿elves upon that difficulty, and have never Å¿poken upon this Matter but in general Terms; in which, as we have already Å¿aid, they make uÅ¿e of the SparkiÅ¿h Term of KindneÅ¿s, to perÅ¿wade the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I believe, that if they were preÅ¿Å¿ed to declare their Opinion, they would Å¿ay, that they mean the moÅ¿t Vigorous, Å¿ince great Vigour appearing inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the abundance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> it would be an ill Expedient, in order to get <hi>Fruit,</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e to a thing they Å¿hould believe proper to maintain that Vigour, and perhaps to augment it; moreover Dung being only look'd upon as a Remedy, and Remedies being only us'd for the DiÅ¿eas'd, it follows from thence, that that Dung is not to be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48210:55"/>
us'd for thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> which, far from being any wiÅ¿e Infirm, have all the Signs imaginable of perfect Health, throughout their whole Extent, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing then that Dung were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Improving <hi>Trees,</hi> Å¿till I do verily believe, that it would Å¿ooner harm theÅ¿e, than procure them the leaÅ¿t Advantage.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we may conclude, that their Opinion is, that Infirm <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿tand in need of the AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of Dungs: Now in order, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, to diÅ¿abuÅ¿e the World of Å¿uch an Error, I affirm Å¿incerely, that by a Å¿tudy'd Experience of a long Series of Years, I do know with certainty, that all the Dung in the World can operate nothing in Favour of any <hi>Tree</hi> whatever; I had liv'd long in that Common Error, my CurioÅ¿ity having begun by that, as well as by the Rote of the Declinings of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but am now happily undeceiv'd, and all thoÅ¿e who will take the Pains to inform themÅ¿elves of the Truth thereof, without prejudice, will certainly conclude with me, that at beÅ¿t it is but a uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Labour and Expence; beÅ¿ides, I declare that it is a great HappineÅ¿s when it does not prove prejudicial; thoÅ¿e Dungs, as I have hinted elÅ¿ewhere, being apt to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender Worms which kill the <hi>Trees,</hi> and at moÅ¿t all the Vertue that is in them, extends no farther than to produce Å¿mall <hi>Roots,</hi> which <hi>Roots,</hi> though really good for Å¿mall <hi>Plants,</hi> can no wiÅ¿e contribute towards the forming of thoÅ¿e fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> by which we judge of the Vigour we deÅ¿ire in <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But in order to enter a little farther into the convincing Proof of this Truth, which I eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, I Å¿hould be glad to be inform'd exactly, what an Infirm <hi>Tree</hi> is, it is a matter I have enlarg'd upon Å¿ufficiently in the TreatiÅ¿e of the DiÅ¿tempers of <hi>Trees, &amp;c.</hi> therefore I Å¿hall now only Å¿ay, that, for Example, an infirm <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> is not always to be concluded Å¿o, by reaÅ¿on of its producing Yellow <hi>Shoots,</hi> Å¿ince there are Å¿ome that are very vigorous and yet produce Leaves of that Colour; they are only Å¿uch upon which Å¿ome thick old <hi>Branches</hi> die, or Å¿uch of which the Extremity of the new <hi>Shoots</hi> wither, or Å¿uch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce none at all, and remain Å¿cabby, full of Cankers and MoÅ¿s, and yet <hi>bloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; yet little of the <hi>Fruit</hi> knits, and that which does knit, remains Å¿mall, Å¿tony and bad: And when the <hi>Tree</hi> happens to produce large Yellow <hi>Shoots,</hi> which happens frequently, to Å¿ome <hi>Pear-Trees Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince-Stocks,</hi> which being planted in a dry lean <hi>Ground</hi> are naturally in a good CaÅ¿e, this defect of Yellow Leaves proceeds from that, Å¿ome of the principal <hi>Roots</hi> lying level with the Ground, are parch'd by the great Heats of the <hi>Summer.</hi> Now the Dung which is imploy'd for Amendments, and is conÅ¿equently put pretty deep into the <hi>Ground,</hi> can no wiÅ¿e prevent this.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if any of the <hi>Branches</hi> of that Infirm <hi>Tree</hi> chance to die, that Defect may proceed from that, either the <hi>Tree</hi> may be overburthen'd with <hi>Branches,</hi> compar'd to the Å¿mall Vigour of it, Å¿o as not to be able to NouriÅ¿h them all, or elÅ¿e from its being planted too high or too low; or laÅ¿tly, from that the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is to NouriÅ¿h it, is either bad or worn out, and eÅ¿pecially, when the Foot of the <hi>Tree</hi> has many dead <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, Dung cannot diÅ¿charge that <hi>Tree</hi> from its Burthen: In the Second, it cannot make it to be better Planted: And in the Third, it cannot revive the dead <hi>Roots:</hi> And LaÅ¿tly, can produce no thick new ones; for Dungs have never been able to Effect that, neither great Dungs, though never Å¿o Rotten, nor the Å¿mall ones we call <hi>Soil.</hi> Thus as long as it produces no thick new <hi>Roots,</hi> we muÅ¿t expect no fine new <hi>Shoots;</hi> and while none of thoÅ¿e kind of new <hi>Shoots</hi> are produc'd, the <hi>Trees</hi> will always remain ill-favour'd, and the <hi>Fruit</hi> will never be well-condition'd in its kind, nor give us Satisfaction by the Abundance of it.</p>
                        <p>To this I add, that if Dung had the Faculty of rend'ring a weak Tree Vigorous; in the firÅ¿t place I Å¿hould have Experienc'd it at one time or another, after having try'd it Å¿o often; which being, I Å¿hould be much to blame to diÅ¿Å¿ent from an Opinion Å¿o well EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, and to endeavour at the Å¿ame time to introduce a new Doctrine in the Room of it, which, inÅ¿tead of doing me any KindneÅ¿s, would only Å¿erve to turn me into Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. In the Second place, if Dungs could afford Vigour, eÅ¿pecially to old Infirm <hi>Trees,</hi> that Advantage would certainly be attended by a very great Inconvenience, which is, that it would occaÅ¿ion the Shooting of abundance of FalÅ¿e Wood or Suckers, and deÅ¿troy the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of that <hi>Tree</hi> towards the producing of <hi>Fruit;</hi> Å¿ince, contrary to the MaÅ¿ters In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it would cauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e <hi>Buds</hi> which were grown round for <hi>Fruit</hi> to Å¿hoot out for Wood, which Wood muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be remov'd as being Ill-condition'd and ill plac'd.</p>
                        <p>I explain more particularly in another Place, what is moÅ¿t proper to be done in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, and that is at the End of the Fifth Book, where I propoÅ¿e Remedies for the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of old <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48210:56"/>
But Å¿uppoÅ¿ing it were good to Dung <hi>Trees,</hi> which I do not allow, what true Rule can be had for the more or leÅ¿s quantity of Dung each <hi>Tree</hi> may require: Will a moderate quantity produce the Å¿ame Effect as a great one, or will not a great quantity perform more than a Å¿mall or moderate one? Moreover, in what place Å¿hall that Dung be plac'd, Å¿hall it be near the <hi>Stem</hi> or Foot, or at a diÅ¿tance from it? It will be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s near the <hi>Stem,</hi> Å¿ince the Extremities of the <hi>Roots,</hi> where all the Action is perform'd, being diÅ¿tant from it, can receive no Benefit by it, and yet it is commonly laid particularly in that place, therefore thoÅ¿e Amendments Å¿hould be plac'd near thoÅ¿e Extremities, but how Å¿hall one be certain in what part they lay, eÅ¿pecially Å¿ince thoÅ¿e Extremities Å¿tretching out Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conÅ¿equently Yearly change their place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I conclude by this Vulgar ObÅ¿ervation, That Infirm <hi>Trees</hi> are met with in good <hi>Grounds,</hi> as well as in ill ones; will the Å¿ame Remedy be proper for both? There appears to me a great deal of difficulty to anÅ¿wer thoÅ¿e three laÅ¿t QueÅ¿tions juÅ¿tly; Å¿o that thoÅ¿e certainly engage themÅ¿elves in a great ConfuÅ¿ion, who will have the only Remedy for <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> to conÅ¿iÅ¿t in Dunging, either to preÅ¿erve their Vigour, or to reÅ¿tore that which they have loÅ¿t. I find much more Advantage, and leÅ¿s Charge, in uÅ¿ing new <hi>Earth,</hi> than any Dungs, whatever they be: I explain in another place the manner of Employing thoÅ¿e new <hi>Moulds,</hi> which has occaÅ¿ion'd me to Å¿ay in another place, that one of the chief Conditions, to Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the planting of young <hi>Trees,</hi> provided they be good, and the <hi>Roots</hi> well <hi>Prun'd,</hi> is to plant them in paÅ¿Å¿able good <hi>Earth,</hi> and Å¿uch as has never been Dung'd.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Quince-Trees</hi> do not thrive well in dry light Grounds, they grow yellow too eaÅ¿ily; Almond and Stone <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> thrive better in this than in Å¿trong <hi>Earth,</hi> in which they are too Å¿ubject to Gumm; thoÅ¿e Å¿trong <hi>Earths</hi> are fitter for <hi>Plums, MeriÅ¿iers,</hi> or Å¿mall bitter <hi>Cherrys, GooÅ¿e-berries, RaÅ¿pberry BuÅ¿hes, &amp;c.

                        </p>
                        <p>After having Explain'd what Å¿ort of <hi>Earths</hi> are beÅ¿t for every kind of <hi>Plantations,</hi> one might think to draw neceÅ¿Å¿ary ConÅ¿equences for the kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon thoÅ¿e kind of Stocks; for InÅ¿tance, for <hi>Pears Graffed</hi> upon free Stocks or <hi>Quince;</hi> for <hi>Peaches</hi> upon <hi>Plum</hi> or <hi>Almond-Trees, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But yet, as we Å¿hall declare in the Sequel, <hi>Earth</hi> has not the Å¿ame Effect as to the good TaÅ¿te of <hi>Fruits,</hi> as it has as to the Vigor of <hi>Trees.

                        <p>It is not Å¿ufficient to have our <hi>Gardens</hi> well Cultivated by <hi>Tillage</hi> and Amendments, beÅ¿ides this, they muÅ¿t be kept very clean, that is, the Walks muÅ¿t always be kept very free from Stones and Weeds, always firm under Foot to walk conveniently and with eaÅ¿e, the Ground likewiÅ¿e clear from Stones and Weeds, the <hi>Trees</hi> always free from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, Snales</hi> and <hi>MoÅ¿s, &amp;c.</hi> Finally, uÅ¿eful <hi>Gardens,</hi> Å¿hould be as pleaÅ¿ing, when old made, as they are diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing when new, in which particular they differ from <hi>Parterres</hi> or <hi>Flowey Gardens,</hi> which are never Å¿o neat, or agreeable to Å¿ight, as the very day

                        <p>What is to be done in all Å¿orts of <hi>Gardens,</hi> as well in making a judicious Choice, as in proportioning and placing the beÅ¿t kinds of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dwarfs, Wall-Trees,</hi> or <hi>Standards.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AMONG the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are at preÅ¿ent in uÅ¿e in the World, It may without prejudice be Å¿aid, There are Å¿ome Å¿o ExquiÅ¿ite and Perfect, that nothing is known more Delicious to the TaÅ¿t, and perhaps, hardly any Thing more uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Health: And accordingly we are accuÅ¿tomed to make Å¿uch frequent uÅ¿e of them at all times, That we are almoÅ¿t perÅ¿waded to Rank them among Things abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Life; we hardly meet with any body that can be without them, Å¿o that there is nothing almoÅ¿t but People will do to have Å¿ome; which is the CauÅ¿e, That how Magnificent and Abundant Å¿oever any Great <hi>FeaÅ¿ts</hi> may be, they are Å¿till found Fault with, if Fair and Good <hi>Fruits</hi> be wanting to Å¿et out their LuÅ¿tre, and to help to leave behind them a certain Idea of GreatneÅ¿s in the Minds of the invited GueÅ¿ts; and thence it alÅ¿o comes to paÅ¿s, That the moÅ¿t Å¿umptuous and Å¿tately Country ManÅ¿ion in the World, is thought to want one of its principal Ornaments, if it be not accompanied with Fair and well Planted and Contrived <hi>Fruit-Gardens.</hi> And therefore Nature, which does nothing in vain, has been careful to provide us almoÅ¿t an infinite Number of different Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and at the Å¿ame time has inÅ¿pired us with a Å¿trong Inclination, not only to Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thoÅ¿e of our own Climates, but alÅ¿o to multiply them, by adding to them, thoÅ¿e of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48210:57"/>
Foreign Countries, Å¿o that to Å¿peak Truth; we ought to look upon the abundance Å¿he has bleÅ¿t us with in this kind, as one of the greateÅ¿t Obligations we have to her; and it Å¿eems, as if all Å¿he had done beÅ¿ides, to make us Live and SubÅ¿iÅ¿t, would be thought very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿iderable, if we were deprived of the TreaÅ¿ure the <hi>Gardens</hi> afford, a TreaÅ¿ure that is to us a very great AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance: For in effect, What is there more Precious or Commodious to Life, than to find good <hi>Fruit</hi> Planted in all inhabited Countries; and what is more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to us, than to have abundance of them at all Å¿eaÅ¿ons of the Year?</p>
                     <p>And here a goodly Field offers it Å¿elf, were I minded to perÅ¿ue it, in praiÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e Rich PreÅ¿ents which the Earth furniÅ¿hes us of her own accord, even in the obÅ¿cureÅ¿t <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ts,</hi> and moÅ¿t horrid <hi>DeÅ¿arts:</hi> But that is a Task that belongs not at all to my ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, and much leÅ¿s is it any part of my preÅ¿ent DeÅ¿ign, and therefore as I am Å¿enÅ¿ible how uncapable I am to undertake it with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, I Å¿hall not venture upon it, but Å¿hall rather confine my Å¿elf within the modeÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ure of Communicating to the World, what by long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I have found uÅ¿eful to InÅ¿truct Men to make the beÅ¿t Improvement of thoÅ¿e Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter-pieces of Nature, and to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them to add Å¿till more and more Perfection to them by their InduÅ¿try.</p>
                     <p>Now, though under the Name of <hi>Fruits,</hi> we ordinarily comprehend all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>Gardens</hi> that go under that Appellation, yet I pretend not here to Treat of any of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the LeÅ¿Å¿er ClaÅ¿Å¿is, Å¿uch as <hi>Strawberries, RaÅ¿pberries</hi> or <hi>GooÅ¿eberries,</hi> nor of <hi>Muk-Melons</hi> neither, though they be certainly <hi>Fruits</hi> moÅ¿t Excellent in their kind; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Articles I reÅ¿erve to Å¿peak of in our <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> of which they are to conÅ¿titute a Part, but I Å¿hall only Treat here, of Å¿uch as grow on Trees, and which, when they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in their kind, and are planted in a proper Seat, and well qualified, make the True Ornaments of <hi>Gardens;</hi> for unleÅ¿s they be indeed of Å¿uch Å¿orts, there are many kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> that inÅ¿tead of doing Honour, do rather a DiÅ¿grace, to the MaÅ¿ter that Cultivates them.</p>
                     <p>And after I have diÅ¿courÅ¿ed of the good <hi>Fruits</hi> of all kinds of Trees, I Å¿hall alÅ¿o Å¿peak of thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which are Å¿o much EÅ¿teemed by all PerÅ¿ons of Quality.</p>
                     <p>I cannot proceed any further without taking Notice to you, how much I am Å¿urpriÅ¿ed at the Contemplation of all the <hi>Fruit</hi> I Å¿ee, as well in general, as particular: For as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinds, I am very much, having made very exact DeÅ¿criptions of them, as well of their InÅ¿ide as OutÅ¿ide, and that both of <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> and thoÅ¿e with <hi>Stones</hi> or <hi>Shells,</hi> as alÅ¿o of <hi>Figs</hi> and <hi>Grapes,</hi> as will be afterward Å¿een; inÅ¿omuch, that of <hi>Pears</hi> only, I can affirm with Truth, that I have Seen, TaÅ¿ted and DeÅ¿cribed above three hundred Å¿everal Å¿orts, all different one from another, without finding all this while above thirty Kinds that were Excellent enough to my TaÅ¿te, to merit the Character of having regularly more good Qualities than bad ones.</p>
                     <p>I expect to find Å¿ome curious PerÅ¿ons, whom my Opinion in matter of Choice, will not pleaÅ¿e in all things: But let them permit me, if they pleaÅ¿e, to make a moÅ¿t humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t, which is, that before they cenÅ¿ure the EÅ¿teem, or DiÅ¿like I expreÅ¿s for certain <hi>Fruits,</hi> they would firÅ¿t Examin very particularly my Intention, which chiefly tends to the EÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hing a continual SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of choice good <hi>Fruits;</hi> and after that, they would Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Peoples particular Palates are not to be diÅ¿puted; that being an inconteÅ¿table Point, and in the next place, that great allowances are to be made to the fickleneÅ¿s of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, of which we are not the MaÅ¿ters, as alÅ¿o of the diverÅ¿ity of Soils and Climates, which is almoÅ¿t infinite, and to the Nature of the Stock of the Tree, which is Å¿ometimes Good, and Å¿ometimes Bad; and laÅ¿tly to the Manner or Figure in which the Å¿everal Trees grow and produce.</p>
                     <p>They are all points that require a great deal of ConÅ¿ideration, and very much Å¿erve to Ballance the Opinions of thoÅ¿e that would judge of them. There are Å¿ometimes ill Pears to be found among the <hi>Virgoulees,</hi> the <hi>LechaÅ¿Å¿erees,</hi> the <hi>Ambrets,</hi> and the <hi>Thorn Pears,</hi> &amp;c. And but Scurvy <hi>Peaches</hi> among the <hi>Minions,</hi> the <hi>Maudlins,</hi> the <hi>Violets,</hi> the <hi>Admirables,</hi> &amp;c. And in Fine, there are Å¿ome bad <hi>Plumbs</hi> among the <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> Å¿ome bad <hi>Grapes</hi> among the <hi>MuÅ¿cats,</hi> and Å¿ome bad <hi>Figgs</hi> among thoÅ¿e that are moÅ¿t EÅ¿teemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not that enough to aÅ¿toniÅ¿h any Curious PerÅ¿on that has applied himÅ¿elf Å¿o much as I have done, to Å¿earch into their Nature, and Å¿hould I be excuÅ¿able if I were Å¿o diÅ¿ingenuous as to Å¿uppreÅ¿s the great ObÅ¿ervations and uÅ¿eful Reflections I have made thereupon, from which I have at laÅ¿t drawn this ConcluÅ¿ion; That although in a certain Å¿ort of good <hi>Fruits,</hi> there may be Å¿ome defective, yet it follows not from thence, that the whole kind Å¿hould therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, nor that on the other Å¿ide, we Å¿hould put any great value upon another kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e, though known, by competent Judges in matter of <hi>Fruits,</hi> to be of a bad Å¿ort, it may by Å¿ome lucky hit; have yielded Å¿ome tolerable good ones, which Å¿ome leÅ¿s delicate Palates
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48210:58"/>
may be Enamoured with? For, in the firÅ¿t place, all the World is agreed, That of <hi>Fruits</hi> conÅ¿idered according to their Nature, there are three ClaÅ¿Å¿es, that is to Å¿ay, there are Å¿ome very good, and Å¿ome very bad ones, and laÅ¿tly, That there are Å¿ome again, that cannot well be comprehended under neither of thoÅ¿e, but can only be lookt upon as <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿imply tolerable, and but indifferently qualified; And it is only thoÅ¿e of this laÅ¿t Rank, that finding here and there Å¿ome Friends and Patrons, give occaÅ¿ion to all DiÅ¿putes ariÅ¿ing about the Choice of <hi>Fruits,</hi> for Å¿eldom it happens, but that all are unanimous in PraiÅ¿ing the FirÅ¿t, and Rejecting the Second Sort, for we Å¿ee that a good <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿et,</hi> or <hi>Virgoulee Pear</hi> is generally EÅ¿teemed, and a <hi>Parmain Pear</hi> or <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> as much decried every where; But 'tis not Å¿o with a <hi>Doyenuee,</hi> or <hi>Dean Pear,</hi> or a St. <hi>Lezin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiÅ¿e granted, that, for Example, Å¿uch a <hi>Fruit</hi> may prove ill one year, or in Å¿uch certain ExpoÅ¿itions or Placings, which may have appeared good Å¿everal years before, or in other ExpoÅ¿itions, and again on the other Å¿ide, that Å¿uch or Å¿uch a <hi>Fruit</hi> may prove good this year, which was not to be endured Å¿ome preceding years.</p>
                     <p>And, in Fine, it is alÅ¿o agreed on all hands, That in one Å¿ort of Soli, Climate and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Tree, Å¿uch <hi>Fruit</hi> proves good, that always regularly proves bad in a different Climate, in another Å¿ort of Ground, and another kind of Figured Tree. For Example, That which perhaps produces good <hi>Fruit</hi> in a full and open Air, will not produce nothing nigh Å¿o good in the Form of a Dwarf Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor every Plant that proÅ¿pers againÅ¿t a Wall, have the Å¿ame DeÅ¿tiny in a full Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor every <hi>Fruit</hi> that proves good in a Sandy Soil, arrive to the Å¿ame perfection in a moiÅ¿ter Ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore I Å¿hall make as exact a DiÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of this matter as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible, that I may be the better able to come to a deciÅ¿ion in the point of Choice, and of the order of Preference, which is the Å¿cope of my preÅ¿ent diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>And beÅ¿ides, as it is probable, I have not yet attained the knowledge of all the Å¿everal Sorts of good <hi>Fruit</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> and much leÅ¿s in the reÅ¿t of the UniverÅ¿e; there may perhaps be Å¿ome which might thrive in our Country, and whoÅ¿e Excellence, were it once known to me, might induce me to make Å¿ome alteration in the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition I am going to EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h; I grant that Å¿uch a thing may be; but yet, I am perÅ¿waded, there are no new Å¿orts produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Å¿o I do not Å¿ay; but that from time to time, Å¿ome Å¿orts may be diÅ¿covered, that after having remained a long time hid in the ObÅ¿curity of certain remote Regions, may come at laÅ¿t to be known and admired by the great ones of the World; nay, we have Å¿everal Å¿orts amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that are now reckoned moÅ¿t exquiÅ¿ite among us, of which I dare affirm, that no mention was made in the firÅ¿t years of my Application to CurioÅ¿ities of this nature.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I Å¿hall not fail to make the beÅ¿t Advantage of all Å¿uch Novelties as faÅ¿t as they Å¿hall come to our hands, and I heartily exhort all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall Å¿ee this TreatiÅ¿e, that they would teÅ¿tifie to the Publick the Å¿ame Zeal which in this reÅ¿pect, I make profeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of: For this at laÅ¿t is certain, that I would not venture to Å¿peak my particular Thoughts concerning this matter of the choice and proportion of Fruits, but after a long Labour and Experience in their Cultivation; my deÅ¿ign in Å¿o doing was at length to give Å¿uch advices as might be Å¿ecurely followed, and with aÅ¿Å¿ured Å¿ucceÅ¿s practiÅ¿ed in a good part of this Kingdom, and in all Climats any thing like it, and 'tis in proÅ¿pect of this end, that I have entertained above theÅ¿e Thirty Years, a particular correÅ¿pondence with the moÅ¿t part of the Curious of our Age, as well at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in our Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> as in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, and the neighbouring Kingdoms; I have made it my Å¿tudy to procure every where as many IlluÅ¿trious Friends in the CurioÅ¿ities of <hi>Gardning</hi> as I could, that I might profit as much as was poÅ¿Å¿ible by their Light, and their rich AcquiÅ¿itions, while I endeavoured at the Å¿ame time not to be unuÅ¿eful to them on my Å¿ide; And as I can affirm without Vanity, that hitherto I have not Å¿ucceeded amiÅ¿s, Å¿o the World may be aÅ¿Å¿ured, that I will never diÅ¿continue to Labour with all the Care imaginable, to draw into our own Soil, what Fruits are moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable in other parts; which is as much as to Å¿ay, in a Word, That I pretend not only to Satisfie and Regulate my own CurioÅ¿ity in this matter, which is not Å¿mall, but alÅ¿o that of other honeÅ¿t and ingenious Lovers of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> which is no leÅ¿s eager than mine.</p>
                     <p>Now though it be not diÅ¿commendable, to be always upon the QueÅ¿t of the DiÅ¿covery of Å¿ome new <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿till, that may deÅ¿erve our Care and Cultivation, which is what I am always doing without intermiÅ¿Å¿ion, yet it Å¿eems to me, that at preÅ¿ent we are already in a Condition to be able to boaÅ¿t of a Å¿tore Å¿ufficient to Form <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Orchards</hi> reaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well furniÅ¿hed with Fruits for all SeaÅ¿ons of the Year, Å¿o that I believe I may Å¿ay there is no great neceÅ¿Å¿ity we Å¿hould be over Å¿olicitous in Å¿eeking out any more: About five and twenty, or thirty years ago, we could not have Å¿aid the Å¿ame, it being an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth, that our Fathers were much leÅ¿s rich in theÅ¿e delicious TreaÅ¿ures than we.</p>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48210:58"/>
However, we cannot but ingeniouÅ¿ly acknowledge, that the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> are not Å¿o happily provided for as the reÅ¿t, they wanting good Fruits that are tender and buttery; for thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of Pears that remain for the Å¿pending of thoÅ¿e Months, have not the Gift to pleaÅ¿e like thoÅ¿e that went before them, nor as moÅ¿t of them themÅ¿elves had formerly, they Å¿eeming every day to loÅ¿e more and more of their ancient Reputation; but till we have better to fill up their Places, we muÅ¿t be content to make the beÅ¿t of them we have; though, upon the whole matter, I think we Å¿hall not be over unhappy, if our <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretien-Pears</hi> which are laÅ¿t ripe, be provided with all the good Qualities they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; for without doubt there are Å¿ome very good ones even in that SeaÅ¿on, and then thoÅ¿e Apples that are left, and which uÅ¿ually laÅ¿t till the Month of <hi>June,</hi> Å¿atisfie well enough Å¿ome curious Palats towards the end of Winter, and at the beginning of the Spring; but to Å¿ay the Truth, they are not in any great number, nor thoÅ¿e of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Sorts.</p>
                     <p>For the better EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing therefore and authorizing my Judgment in Å¿uch Fruits as are known to us, I can aÅ¿Å¿ure you, and you may believe me, that I have not been only content with Å¿eeing, taÅ¿ting and examining them my Å¿elf for Å¿everal Years together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaÅ¿t partiality, but becauÅ¿e I would neglect nothing that might aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t me to make a well-grounded determination in the matter, I have held frequent AÅ¿Å¿emblies of curious PerÅ¿ons, and Å¿uch who were perfectly well skill'd in things of that nature, and that were perhaps Men of as delicate and exquiÅ¿ite Palats as any in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>After Å¿o many Precautions and Experiences, I at laÅ¿t reÅ¿olv'd to undertake this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e; <note place="margin">The DeÅ¿ign of the Order of this Part.</note> and the better to Å¿ucceed in it, and take occaÅ¿ion to declare what is good or bad in each particular Å¿ort of Fruit, with the different names under which they are diÅ¿guiÅ¿ed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Countries where they are found; for the number of thoÅ¿e Fruits that have but one Name, and particularly among Pears; as, for Example, the <hi>Boncretien,</hi> the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿eleit,</hi> the <hi>Buttred Pear,</hi> the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire John,</hi> the <hi>Portal, &amp;c.</hi> is but very Å¿lender; but as for other <hi>Pears, Plums, Peaches, Apples, &amp;c.</hi> it is quite another caÅ¿e with them, there being few of them without two or three, and Å¿ometimes more Names.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I thought my Å¿elf obliged firÅ¿t, to endeavour to draw out the Picture and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cription of each Fruit, and to make it big enough, that it might be able to give the more lively InÅ¿truction for a thing which I judge neceÅ¿Å¿ary, which is to learn a Man to diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿h more eaÅ¿ily, as well by the Eye as the TaÅ¿te, the only true Name which each reÅ¿pective Fruit ought to have: And that, without doubt, will be the Å¿ame which will be found in uÅ¿e among the Able and Curious in theÅ¿e Matters at Court; the reÅ¿t of the World, as well in theÅ¿e as other things, being apt to follow exactly the Modes and Manners practiÅ¿ed there.</p>
                     <p>From Å¿uch Determination of the Name of each Fruit, well Authorized by the DeÅ¿cription which I Å¿hall make of them, it will, I hope, come to paÅ¿s, that Gentlemen will no more fall into the Inconvenience of being peÅ¿terd with bad Fruits, under the names of good Ones, nor of having one Å¿ort under different Names, and, conÅ¿eqnently of being Å¿o impoÅ¿ed on as to be made to believe they have a great many Å¿orts, when they have but a few, conÅ¿idering the number of Trees in their Gardens. I Å¿hall place thoÅ¿e DeÅ¿criptions in Å¿uch paÅ¿Å¿ages where I Å¿hall decide the choice of each Fruit in particular; and as I have elÅ¿ewhere Å¿aid, they are intended only for thoÅ¿e that will take the pains to read them: As for others, that deÅ¿ire only to be reÅ¿olved in Å¿hort, which are the good Å¿orts, and what proportion of each, they are to obÅ¿erve in their Å¿everal Gardens; they will find at the end of this part, a little Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where they may preÅ¿ently Å¿atisfie themÅ¿elves.</p>
                     <p>In the Å¿econd Place, I thought it would not be a little conducing to my purpoÅ¿e, to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e I am going to give my advice to a great many new curious Gentlemen, one after the other, who are all deÅ¿irous to be planting Fruit-Trees, but very much perplexed how to determine either what Å¿orts of Trees, or what numbers of each Å¿ort they Å¿hall fix upon.</p>
                     <p>Whereof the firÅ¿t, perhaps, has not room for above one Plant, whether it be in form of a Dwarf-Tree or a Wall-Tree; a Second has place but for two, but another has room for a hundred Trees, and another for as many more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all of them are Å¿tudying what Choice to fix upon, and that with a great deal of eagerneÅ¿s too; for nothing is Å¿o hot upon the DeÅ¿ign as are the Young <hi>CurioÅ¿o</hi>'s in Gard'ning, who always are big with longing to Å¿ee their <hi>Gardens</hi> made up, and that quickly too, and yet none of them know where to begin, having yet received no directions from any body Skill'd in thoÅ¿e Affairs.</p>
                     <p>To eaÅ¿e them therefore of their Pain and Perplexity, I Å¿hall fancy my Å¿elf in the place of every one of them one after the other, that I may be the better able to CounÅ¿el each of them to do what I would actually do my Å¿elf, if I had that to do which any one of them would undertake; Å¿o that Å¿ometimes you muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e me Å¿ome curious Gentleman that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48210:59"/>
would plant but a very Å¿mall Garden, Å¿ometimes one that would cultivate but a middling one, and Å¿ometimes another that would form a very great one: And I Å¿hall act all theÅ¿e Å¿everal PerÅ¿onages, not only to be able to give my more effectual AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming new Plantations, but in reforming old ones too, when ill contriv'd; Å¿o that, by this means, I pretend, that, after a few Years time, every one of thoÅ¿e Gentlemen that will take my Advice, Å¿hall infallibly find that pleaÅ¿ure in his Gardens, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed to himÅ¿elf to enjoy in them.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected, That it is not very ordinary to have Gardens Å¿o little to admit of the planting but of one Tree, or two of each Å¿ort; but though that were true, as it is not, witneÅ¿s the little Gardens of Å¿o many Religious People in Convents, and of Å¿o many petty BurgeÅ¿Å¿es in Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet would I demand the Liberty to Å¿uppoÅ¿e Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, as a thing not only Å¿erviceable to my DeÅ¿ign; but which appears to me more neceÅ¿Å¿ary than any thing, to make me be the better, and more advantageouÅ¿ly underÅ¿tood by all the World.</p>
                     <p>And this being then Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, I Å¿hall firÅ¿t advertiÅ¿e you, That among all Å¿orts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kernel or Stone-<hi>Fruits,</hi> there are Å¿ome that I would willingly plant in a Garden of <note place="margin">AdvertiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> a certain bigneÅ¿s, which yet I have not eÅ¿teem enough for, to Plant in one of a Å¿maller Extent, it being eaÅ¿ie enough for a great one to receive any thing that is to be found in a little one, though the Å¿ame ConÅ¿equence from great to leÅ¿s, does not appear to me Å¿o feaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be drawn.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides, there being different Manners and Forms of having <hi>Fruit Trees,</hi> I am to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e you in the next place, That, for Example, as to <hi>Pears,</hi> there are Å¿ome that I would Å¿eldom plant in any other Form than that of <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> as the <hi>Buttred Pears,</hi> or <hi>Beurrees</hi> and <hi>Virgoulees, &amp;c.</hi> and others again, which I more willingly raiÅ¿e in the Figure of high <hi>Trees,</hi> as are all the <hi>Fruits</hi> of an indifferent bigneÅ¿s, and more eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as are apt to doughy and inÅ¿ipid, Å¿uch as the <hi>Petit-oins,</hi> the <hi>SucrÃ©-verts</hi> or <hi>Sugred-greens,</hi> the <hi>Thorn-pears,</hi> the <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonnes</hi> or good <hi>LouiÅ¿as,</hi> the <hi>LanÅ¿acs,</hi> &amp;c. And that there are Å¿ome that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bear not well any where elÅ¿e but againÅ¿t Walls; as <hi>Boncretiens, Bergamots, Little MuÅ¿cats</hi> or <hi>Musk pears, &amp;c.</hi> and others again that will proÅ¿per well enough in what Figure or Place Å¿oever you plant them; as <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets, Robines, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries, St. Germains, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, There being alÅ¿o <hi>Soils</hi> of Å¿everal Natures, and <hi>Gardens</hi> of different Situations, I muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e advertiÅ¿e you, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That there are Å¿ome <hi>Fruits</hi> which delight only in dry Grounds; as, <hi>Peaches, MuÅ¿cats</hi> or <hi>Musk pears, &amp;c.</hi> and others that proÅ¿per well enough in <hi>Soils</hi> that are a little moiÅ¿t, as <hi>Cherries, Plumbs, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there are Grounds that will not agree indifferently with all Å¿orts of Plants; as for Example, <hi>Peaches</hi> upon <hi>Plum-tree Stocks,</hi> and <hi>Pear-tree Graffs</hi> upon <hi>Quince Stocks,</hi> love rather fat than dry <hi>Soils;</hi> and on the contrary, <hi>Peach-graffes</hi> upon <hi>Almond-trees,</hi> and <hi>Pear-tree-graffs</hi> upon <hi>Frank</hi> or <hi>Good-Kernel-Stocks,</hi> proÅ¿pering both well in Sandy Grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there are Å¿ome Fruits that do not ripen well, but when very well Å¿hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the Cold: as <hi>MuÅ¿cat</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> and particularly about <hi>Paris,</hi> and others that endure well enough the open Air, as all Red <hi>Fruits</hi> and moÅ¿t Kernel <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> That moiÅ¿t Grounds are proper to produce large <hi>Fruit,</hi> but not to make them Å¿o delicate, without an extraordinary Care and Cultivation, whereas dry <hi>Soils</hi> are qualified to give them a delicious TaÅ¿te, yet they are apt to yield but Å¿mall <hi>Fruit,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s they be extraordinarily aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted.</p>
                     <p>Now having deÅ¿igned to give my Advice upon all theÅ¿e Differences, that is to Å¿ay, the Differences of Extent of <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Grounds,</hi> and the Differences of ExpoÅ¿itions in them, the Differences of <hi>Soils</hi> and their Situations, the Differences of the Å¿everal Forms of <hi>Trees,</hi> and of the Stocks on which they are Graffed; as alÅ¿o to give my particular CounÅ¿el and Directions about all Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits, viz. 1Å¿t.</hi> how to chuÅ¿e the beÅ¿t: <hi>2dly,</hi> How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoÅ¿e beÅ¿t, to cull out thoÅ¿e only that are moÅ¿t likely to proÅ¿per in that particular Form of a <hi>Tree,</hi> in which they muÅ¿t be planted: <hi>3dly,</hi> How to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of each <hi>Tree</hi> in that part of the <hi>Garden,</hi> that is moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary for it: And <hi>4thly</hi> and laÅ¿tly, How to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve a juÅ¿t proportion between the Number of <hi>Trees</hi> of each Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit;</hi> I Å¿hall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ue this Method.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> I Å¿hall Å¿peak of Kernel <hi>Fruits,</hi> beginning firÅ¿t with <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> to Å¿hew firÅ¿t, which are thoÅ¿e that may Å¿ucceed beÅ¿t upon <hi>Dwarf-trees; 2dly,</hi> Which may be moÅ¿t happily planted in Form of <hi>Standard Trees: 3dly,</hi> Which require to be placed againÅ¿t Walls: And <hi>4thly</hi> and laÅ¿tly, which are thoÅ¿e that give Satisfaction all manner of ways: After which, I will Å¿uccinctly deliver my Judgment as to <hi>Apples,</hi> remarking to you, which I eÅ¿teem moÅ¿t, and which leaÅ¿t, whether to be rear'd in the form of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> or of <hi>Standards,</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48210:59"/>
not thinking it worth any ones while, to give themÅ¿elves the Pains of Planting them in any other FaÅ¿hion, that is to Å¿ay, of making <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>And when I have given Order how to fill up with <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Space of each Garden, I Å¿hall proceed afterward to the moÅ¿t curious part reckon'd in all Gardens, which is that of <hi>Wall-Fruit,</hi> and Å¿hall endeavour to Å¿hew in what manner I judge any Gentleman may moÅ¿t uÅ¿efully employ what walling he has, let its Extent in length or heighth be what it will, and what <hi>Fruits</hi> will beÅ¿t merit place there, and what are unworthy of that choice Station; under which Head, I Å¿hall treat not only of <hi>Plumbs</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> but alÅ¿o of <hi>Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> and Å¿hall tell what <hi>Fruits</hi> of all thoÅ¿e Sorts, delight in Å¿uch and Å¿uch certain ExpoÅ¿itions, and can hardly endure any other; and which of them, in fine, are of a Temper good enough to agree indifferently with any of them.</p>
                     <p>When I Å¿hall go about to give CounÅ¿el about the choice and proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> there is one Article, in Å¿peaking to which, I Å¿hall make great Difference between thoÅ¿e cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gentlemen that aim at the pleaÅ¿ing of their own Palats, only in Planting them, and Å¿uch as do it only with deÅ¿ign to Å¿ell their <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t whom I aim chiefly to gratifie in this TreatiÅ¿e, ought above all things, to Å¿eek for, as one may term it, the true intrinÅ¿ick Merit of each Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit,</hi> as diÅ¿cernible by their own TaÅ¿te, or by that of their Friends, for whoÅ¿e Entertainment they deÅ¿ign them.</p>
                     <p>As for the other, they need to regard little elÅ¿e in them but the Beauty, the LargeneÅ¿s, and the ordinary FruitfulneÅ¿s and Abundance of them, and to Å¿ee they be of thoÅ¿e ancient Kinds that are moÅ¿t commonly Sold, and go off beÅ¿t; Å¿uch as the <hi>Orange-pear,</hi> the Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Pear,</hi> the dry <hi>Martin, &amp;c.</hi> which in thoÅ¿e Qualities carry it by many Degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie,</hi> the <hi>Petit-oin,</hi> the <hi>CraÅ¿ane, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as to their Cultivation, I make no great DiÅ¿tinction between one and the other <note place="margin">

                        </note> (though I would not have this Maxim too rigorouÅ¿ly underÅ¿tood) they ought to know, That commonly it is not the great number of <hi>Trees,</hi> which, in proportion to the great Expences they have coÅ¿t their MaÅ¿ters, bring forth the greateÅ¿t Quantity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> it is rather a moderate Number, well contriv'd and diÅ¿pos'd, and well cultivated, that gives the moÅ¿t compleat Satisfaction in all reÅ¿pects.</p>
                     <p>The Care that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary and Å¿ufficient enough for the Cultivation of the <hi>Trees</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Gardens,</hi> or of the <hi>Plants</hi> in <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> will go but a little way in producing any happy Effects in greater Undertakings, and we muÅ¿t reduce our Å¿elves to midling ones, if we pretend to any very certain Å¿ucceÅ¿s by that kind of Culture; but with this precaution however, that that which is little in reÅ¿pect of Å¿uch a certain Man, may be great in reÅ¿pect of another, and that on the contrary, that which might be reckon'd too great an Undertaking for Å¿uch or Å¿uch a Curious PerÅ¿on that wants thoÅ¿e Conveniences Å¿ome have, may be too Å¿mall a one to another better furniÅ¿h'd with Means to carry on the Cultivation of his Grounds. <note place="margin">Res AgreÅ¿tis eÅ¿t infidioÅ¿iÅ¿Å¿ima cunctanti. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumella.</hi> Imbecillior ager, quam Agriola eÅ¿Å¿e debet, quom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am cum Å¿it cum eo colluctandum, Å¿i fundus praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat, allidit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                     <p>And Å¿ince 'tis not enough to have rendred you an Account of the Method I think my Å¿elf obliged to obÅ¿erve in this TreatiÅ¿e, I think it further expedient clearly to explain to you what my TaÅ¿te and Judgment is, in all Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and firÅ¿t in <hi>Pears;</hi> that after I have declared what pleaÅ¿es or diÅ¿pleaÅ¿es me, as well in thoÅ¿e that are eaten Raw, as in thoÅ¿e which are not good without Baking or PreÅ¿erving: No Body may be Å¿urprized at the PraiÅ¿es I Å¿hall beÅ¿tow on the one, and the Å¿mall Account I make of Å¿ome others; <note place="margin">Non aliter qui adverÅ¿o vix flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine lembum, remigiis Å¿ubigit. <hi>Virg.

                     <p>Therefore I Å¿ay, That as for raw <hi>Pears,</hi> I love them in the firÅ¿t place that have a kind of Butter-like and Å¿mooth Pulp, or at leaÅ¿t tender and delicate, with a Å¿weet Å¿ugred and well reliÅ¿h'd Juice; and eÅ¿pecially when theÅ¿e Perfections are Å¿et off with Å¿omething of a Perfume; Å¿uch as are the <hi>Bergamot-pears,</hi> the <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Green-longs,</hi> the <hi>Beurrees</hi> or <hi>Butter-pears, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries, Ambrets, RuÅ¿Å¿elets, Virgoulees, MarquiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>MarchioneÅ¿Å¿es,

Petit-oins, Winter Thorn pears</hi> or <hi>EÅ¿pines de Hyver, St. Germains, Salviatis, LanÅ¿acs, CraÅ¿anes,</hi> little <hi>MuÅ¿cats</hi> or <hi>Musk-pears, CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madames,</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thighs, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Å¿econd place, for want of the foregoing Å¿orts, I love thoÅ¿e that have a Pulp that breaks Å¿hort in the mouth, with a Å¿weet and Å¿urged Juice, and that Å¿ometimes with a little Å¿mack of Perfume, Å¿uch as the <hi>Winter-Boncretien,</hi> gathered out of a good place, the <hi>Robine,</hi> the <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿olet,</hi> the <hi>Summer Musk Boncretien,</hi> the dry <hi>Martin,</hi> and Å¿ometimes even the <hi>Portal,</hi> the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire-John,</hi> the <hi>Orange-green-pear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, I truly eÅ¿teem thoÅ¿e that are pretty much perfum'd and well Å¿cented; though I do not care this Perfection Å¿hould be incloÅ¿ed in a Pulp that is extream hard, Å¿tony and full of dreggy Matter, as the <hi>Amadote,</hi> the <hi>Thick-tail</hi> or <hi>GroÅ¿Å¿e-queuÃ«,</hi> the <hi>Citron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> and the great <hi>Winter Musk pear, &amp;c.</hi> For that hardneÅ¿s and Å¿tonineÅ¿s do Å¿o much diÅ¿guÅ¿t me in all Å¿orts of <hi>Pears,</hi> that though I paÅ¿Å¿ionately love a little Smack of Perfume in any <hi>Fruit,</hi> yet thoÅ¿e two great Faults do in a great MeaÅ¿ure ruine the eÅ¿teem I Å¿hould have otherwiÅ¿e, for thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Musked-pears</hi> that I have laÅ¿t mentioned.</p>
                     <p>After having thus expreÅ¿Å¿ed what pleaÅ¿es me in raw <hi>Pears;</hi> it is no very hard matter to gueÅ¿s what may particularly diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e me in them; for that doubtleÅ¿s is, firÅ¿t, a Pulp, which, inÅ¿tead of being of a Butter-like, Å¿mooth and tender Å¿ubÅ¿tance, or pleaÅ¿ingly Å¿hort in the mouth, is doughy, as that of the <hi>BelliÅ¿Å¿ime,</hi> the <hi>Musked Beurree,</hi> the <hi>White Beurree</hi> or <hi>Gravel-pear,</hi> or that of the <hi>Musked Valley-pear,</hi> the moÅ¿t part of the <hi>Doynnees</hi> or <hi>Dean-pears,</hi> &amp;c. Or which is Å¿harp or Å¿our, as that of the ordinary <hi>Valley-pear, &amp;c.</hi> Or that is hard and tough, as that of the <hi>Bernardiere,</hi> of the <hi>Mountain Foundling, &amp;c.</hi> Or full of Å¿tony and dreggy Earthy Matter, as that of the <hi>Musked Pernan,</hi> of the <hi>Milet, &amp;c.</hi> Or that is of a wildiÅ¿h TaÅ¿te, as the <hi>Gilogile,</hi> the <hi>Dutch-pears</hi> or <hi>FoÅ¿Å¿e-pears,</hi> and a numerous Train of others, of which I will make a particular Catalogue.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Pears</hi> to Stew or Bake, I prefer thoÅ¿e that are large, that Colour well in the doing, whoÅ¿e Pulp is Å¿weet and Å¿omewhat firm, and eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as keep the longeÅ¿t in Winter, Å¿uch as are the <hi>Frank-reals,</hi> the <hi>Double-flowers,</hi> and the <hi>Donvilles:</hi> The <hi>Bonere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien</hi> particularly is admirably good prepared any of thoÅ¿e ways, only its preparation yields not Å¿o pleaÅ¿ing a Colour; and in truth, when there is any <hi>Pear</hi> among them that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, either in Shape or Colour, it ought to be Å¿erved up only Baked, Stewed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e Prepared; the <hi>Boncretien-pear,</hi> that has none of thoÅ¿e Defects, requiring and well deÅ¿erving to appear in its natural Beauty, that is, to be Å¿erved up raw.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides theÅ¿e, the <hi>Amadote,</hi> the <hi>BeÅ¿idery,</hi> and above all, the <hi>LanÅ¿ac-pear</hi> for <hi>Autumn;</hi> and generally all the <hi>Winter-pears</hi> that are good raw, as the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> the <hi>LouiÅ¿Å¿e-bonne</hi> or good <hi>LouiÅ¿a,</hi> the dry <hi>Martin,</hi> the <hi>St. Lezin, &amp;c.</hi> are admirable baked, or otherwiÅ¿e prepared by Fire, provided they be done before they be quite ripe, becauÅ¿e otherwiÅ¿e their conÅ¿iÅ¿tence will be too Å¿oft and doughy. The <hi>Winter Certeau,</hi> Å¿eems to me too Å¿mall to be kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and therefore it would be better to have Å¿ome <hi>Standard Tree</hi> of it in the <hi>Apple-Orchards:</hi> The <hi>Gatelier</hi> reÅ¿olves it Å¿elf too Å¿oon into <hi>Marmalade;</hi> the <hi>Catillac,</hi> the <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabie,</hi> the <hi>Parmain-pear, &amp;c.</hi> are endued with Å¿uch a TartneÅ¿s, that no Sugar can qualifie, and the <hi>Pound-pears</hi> and <hi>Love-pears</hi> are Å¿o near a-kin to them, that they may almoÅ¿t be reckoned in the Å¿ame Rank.</p>
                     <p>To theÅ¿e firÅ¿t ObÅ¿ervations I add, That, if in a very good <hi>Soil</hi> you are conÅ¿in'd within a Garden of very Å¿mall Extent, Å¿o that having room but for a very inconÅ¿iderable Number of <hi>Trees,</hi> you cannot have Å¿o much as one Stock of each, though Choice were made only of the prime Sorts, than in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, it were not amiÅ¿s, when the <hi>Trees</hi> would Å¿uffer the Experiment, to endeavour to have two excellent Å¿orts of <hi>Fruit,</hi> of two different SeaÅ¿ons, upon every Stock; as for Example, a <hi>Boncretien</hi> with a <hi>Beurree</hi> or <hi>Buttred pear;</hi> a <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie</hi> with an <hi>Ambret;</hi> a <hi>Violet-peach</hi> with a <hi>Minion;</hi> a <hi>White Maudlin</hi> with an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, &amp;c.</hi> And there may be Å¿everal ReaÅ¿ons to juÅ¿tifie the graffing of Å¿uch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ity of Fruits upon the Å¿ame <hi>Tree,</hi> provided the Stock be vigorous, and Å¿hoots forth promiÅ¿ing Branches on both Å¿ides; for otherwiÅ¿e the Enterprize would prove Å¿ucceÅ¿leÅ¿s, becauÅ¿e 'tis to no purpoÅ¿e to graff upon that Å¿ide of a <hi>Tree</hi> that is weak, with any hopes to have any <hi>Fruit</hi> there, either Å¿o good or for Å¿o long time, as may be expected from that Å¿ide which is Å¿ound and vigorous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> I declare my Å¿elf a Å¿worn Enemy to all affected Multiplicity, and that I am not at all taken with the PleaÅ¿ure of Å¿ome that paÅ¿s for curious PerÅ¿ons, that believe and aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ert publickly, That thoÅ¿e that pretend to have any thing like a <hi>Garden,</hi> Å¿hould have in it of every thing Å¿omething; there being Å¿ome whoÅ¿e Palate is Å¿o far from being delicate, that they brag, for Example, they have two or three hundred Sorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> which they warrant all to be good, or, at leaÅ¿t, not bad. And they affirm, in a manner, as much of the goodneÅ¿s of <hi>Peaches, Plumbs, Apples, Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> of which they alÅ¿o boaÅ¿t to be Å¿tored with an incredible Variety.</p>

Such a great number of <hi>Fruits</hi> does but fright me, as certainly knowing, that what they Å¿ay, cannot be true of all of them, in reÅ¿pect of GoodneÅ¿s; And, for my part, I cannot find in my Heart with the Curious of that Å¿ort, to trouble my Å¿elf to get for one and the Å¿ame SeaÅ¿on one good <hi>Pear</hi> and Å¿everal others but indifferent; how fair Å¿oever the later may appear to the Eye: But I much rather chuÅ¿e to multiply thoÅ¿e Sorts which are infallibly good, that I may have, during any one SeaÅ¿on, a Å¿ufficient Å¿tore of one Å¿ort that is excellent, than to let my Fancy be led away after a compound diverÅ¿ity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which may be perhaps agreeable to the Sight; but are aÅ¿Å¿uredly diÅ¿guÅ¿tful to the TaÅ¿te; or, at beÅ¿t, qualified with a very indifferent degree of GoodneÅ¿s; or, to Å¿peak plainer, with a little GoodneÅ¿s accompanied with Å¿everal great Defects.</p>
                     <p>I know that nothing is more pleaÅ¿ing in a Company that are Curious, and PaÅ¿Å¿ionate Admirers of good <hi>Fruits,</hi> than to be able to furniÅ¿h them with Å¿everal Sorts at the Å¿ame Time, when they are good enough to puÅ¿le the moÅ¿t Delicate PerÅ¿ons among them, to judge which is moÅ¿t Excellent; as it may happen in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> for <hi>Summer-Fruit;</hi> and of <hi>October, November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> for thoÅ¿e of <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter:</hi> But in my Judgment, nothing is more unbecoming or beneath any PerÅ¿on of Quality that is Curious in Å¿uch Rarities, than to deÅ¿ire to have an Abundance of all Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> without regard to any other Excellence, but what will meerly qualifie them to make a fine Å¿how in the Variety from which reÅ¿ults the Å¿o much praiÅ¿ed Beauty of certain <hi>Pyramids;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What is to be thought of <hi>Fruit Pyramids,</hi> and how they are to be order'd. In this and the two next Paragraphs.</note> for alas! they are <hi>Fruits</hi> that will not endure the TeÅ¿t of any other SenÅ¿e but the Eye, which commonly are only uÅ¿ed for <hi>Decorations</hi> to Tables, and are indeed now a-days in FaÅ¿hion, and which, 'tis true, have Å¿ome appearance of GreatneÅ¿s and Magnificence, but yet after all, are good for nothing elÅ¿e but to do Honour to the skill of the Officer that piled them up with Å¿o much Å¿ymmetry.</p>
                     <p>Upon which occaÅ¿ion, I Å¿hall by the by tell you, That in the HouÅ¿es of Great PerÅ¿ons, where Å¿uch Å¿orts of <hi>Pyramids</hi> are in uÅ¿e, and are by CuÅ¿tom become in a manner neceÅ¿Å¿ary, particular care Å¿hould be taken to have Å¿pacious <hi>Gardens,</hi> that will afford room to plant <hi>Trees</hi> enough to furniÅ¿h wherewithal to compoÅ¿e Å¿o many as occaÅ¿ion Å¿hall require, that may conÅ¿iÅ¿t all of Å¿uch Å¿orts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> as are both beautiful to the Eye, and excelling in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s: Which perhaps will not be over difficult to effect.</p>
                     <p>But for midling Gardens, we ought only to be Ambitious to have Magazines of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are really good and delicious, and not of Å¿uch as Å¿erve only for Ornament and Shew: And perhaps, if a Å¿ufficient abundance of Å¿uch fair and good <hi>Fruits</hi> could be attained, I would be bold to maintain, that <hi>Pyramids</hi> compos'd only of them, as they would be really much more valuable than thoÅ¿e others, though beautified with leÅ¿s Variety of Colours, Shapes and Kinds of <hi>Fruits,</hi> Å¿o would they be better accepted, and more highly eÅ¿teem'd. At leaÅ¿t, without pretending to go about utterly to decry the Mode of uÅ¿ing that other Å¿ort of <hi>Pyramids,</hi> which plead a kind of PreÅ¿cription for appearing at great Tables, if they muÅ¿t be uÅ¿ed, I would have them always accompanied with a pretty Basket well fill'd with the choice eating <hi>Fruits</hi> of the SeaÅ¿on, all fair and goodly, and all perfectly ripe; which in the Courts of Kings and Princes, is called the <hi>Hors-d'oeuvre,</hi> or the <hi>Out-work;</hi> and, as the Honour of a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> is to come off always whole and entire, without Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the leaÅ¿t breach or rufle, neither in its ConÅ¿truction, nor in its Symmetry; Å¿o I pretend, that on the contrary, the Honour of the Basket conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in returning always empty, without bringing back any thing its Errand was to preÅ¿ent.</p>
                     <p>I will not here diÅ¿pute whether it be Expedient to Plant any <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in little Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, <note place="margin">Whether it be fit to Plant any <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in little Gardens.</note> becauÅ¿e no Body queÅ¿tions it, and eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e of a large Extent, and that are Å¿pacious enough to contain all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> neither will I move any doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there Å¿hould be any placed in very Å¿mall Gardens, becauÅ¿e that is a thing that depends of the Inclination of the MaÅ¿ters of them, which are at their own Liberty to order them as they pleaÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>But Å¿uppoÅ¿ing them to have already taken up a ReÅ¿olution to Plant Å¿ome Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> in them, but are at Å¿ome loÅ¿s, what Å¿ort of <hi>Fruits</hi> they had beÅ¿t to fix upon for that purpoÅ¿e; I can very well diÅ¿cuÅ¿s this latter QueÅ¿tion, and give them my Opinion of what kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> it would be moÅ¿t for their purpoÅ¿e to make choice of for a <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> to Plant in Å¿uch a little Garden; as namely, whether a <hi>Pear-tree</hi> or an <hi>Apple tree,</hi> a <hi>Plum-tree</hi> or a <hi>Peach-tree,</hi> a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> or a <hi>Cherry-tree, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>In which Point my DeciÅ¿ion Å¿hould preÅ¿ently be, That all thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Trees</hi> that bear not eaÅ¿ily, or that produce not <hi>Fruit</hi> of Å¿ufficient GoodneÅ¿s, Å¿hould be excluded out of all very little Gardens; and conÅ¿equently, that no <hi>Cherry-trees</hi> or <hi>Apple-trees</hi> upon Free-Å¿tocks Å¿hould enter into them; but as to the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> on the <hi>ParadiÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Sweet-Apple-tree</hi> Stocks, the CaÅ¿e alters, becauÅ¿e they produce Å¿uch Å¿mall Tops, that one may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

admit a Å¿mall number of them into a little Garden, without incumbring it in the leaÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peach-tree</hi> might well pretend a place there, for the Excellency of its good <hi>Fruit;</hi> but the Objections againÅ¿t it are, That in a few Years it grows too high, and Å¿preads into a very ill-favour'd Top, and is too apt to Å¿hed its Flowers, to give any hopes of contenting its Owner. BeÅ¿ides that, it is but too true, That excepting in Å¿ome few City-Gardens, that are Å¿heltred from the <hi>North</hi> Wind by Lofty Buildings, or very high Walls. <hi>Peach-trees</hi> can hardly thrive any where in the form of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muÅ¿t be let alone, only for the hot Countries, where they proÅ¿per wonderfully in the Vine-yards.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plum-trees</hi> of thoÅ¿e Sorts that we eÅ¿teem moÅ¿t, are alÅ¿o liable to the Inconvenience of growing too high, or of bearing very late, and very uncertainly; and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, are to be excluded thoÅ¿e little Gardens of which we are treating.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ame is to be Å¿aid of the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> which beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e other Incommodities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires too much Attendance for the well covering it, for want of which it will be in great danger of periÅ¿hing.</p>
                     <p>In fine, among them all, our only Choice muÅ¿t fall upon the <hi>Pear-tree,</hi> for which I <note place="margin">The <hi>Pear-tree</hi> of all the moÅ¿t proper to be Planted in little Gardens, and why.</note> moÅ¿t incline; becauÅ¿e, if it be well ordered, its top or Å¿preading cannot well grow monÅ¿trous enough to be any NuiÅ¿ance; but, on the contrary, may be agreeable, and give pleaÅ¿ure all the Year long, either by its EarlineÅ¿s, Plenty and conÅ¿iderable GoodneÅ¿s of its <hi>Fruit,</hi> or by its round, open and well ordered Figure, which laÅ¿ts in all SeaÅ¿ons. Next then, we are to Å¿ee of what Å¿ort that one <hi>Pear</hi> muÅ¿t be, that is to be planted in a Garden where the MaÅ¿ter would have but one, or where there is no Room for any more; then of what Kind the Å¿econd muÅ¿t be, where there is Room for it; and thence we Å¿hall go on in order, to examin of what reÅ¿pective Å¿orts muÅ¿t be all the reÅ¿t, that are fitteÅ¿t to be Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every one of the other Gardens, of the Å¿everal BigneÅ¿Å¿es to be propoÅ¿ed, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Å¿ame time, which are to be Graffed on Free-Å¿tocks, and which on <hi>Quince-</hi>Å¿tocks.</p>
                     <p>But I Å¿hall do nothing of all this, without firÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿ing every one of the Gardens I Å¿hall treat of to be encloÅ¿ed with Å¿ome Å¿ort of Wall, and conÅ¿equently in a condition to receive Å¿ome <hi>Wall-Fruit-trees,</hi> from which they may promiÅ¿e themÅ¿elves at leaÅ¿t with Å¿o much the greater certainty, the pleaÅ¿ure of having Å¿ome good <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumn Fruits;</hi> for I hardly reckon them for Gardens that have not the Advantage to be encloÅ¿ed with Walls, although it were for nothing elÅ¿e but to Å¿ecure them from the injurious BlaÅ¿ts of the Cold Winds.</p>
                     <p>And Å¿uppoÅ¿ing further, That here we are to treat of a little Garden, qualified with all the Conditions neceÅ¿Å¿ary, in regard of its <hi>Soil,</hi> and which we have above explained.</p>
                     <p>And laÅ¿tly, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing, That for little Gardens, the aim of a true and well guided Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioÅ¿ity, is rather to raiÅ¿e <hi>Fruit</hi> that may be fair and good, than purely to endeavour to have it early and haÅ¿tily, without any ConÅ¿ideration of its Quality. For to Gentlemen, that are of this laÅ¿t Humour, I would not give CounÅ¿el to Plant any <hi>Tree</hi> of our beÅ¿t Kinds, but to them I would offer other Advices, which, being Å¿uch as I diÅ¿like my Å¿elf, would by ConÅ¿equence not be over good to follow; and that would be, for Example, to Plant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Orange-green, White Butter, Doyennee</hi> or <hi>BeÅ¿idery Pear-trees,</hi> becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e kind of Trees will aÅ¿Å¿uredly yield Fruit much Å¿ooner than the choicer Sorts; or, if they would have really good Fruit, but care not much whether they be of thoÅ¿e beautiful Sorts of Trees that content the Eye at all SeaÅ¿ons, as well by the Regularity of their DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, as the Beauty of their Shapes, then I would CounÅ¿el them, after they have choÅ¿en Å¿ome <note place="margin">What the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor adviÅ¿es to Gentlemen over haÅ¿ty for Fruit, with the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it.</note> of thoÅ¿e better Sorts, to Plant them indifferently, juÅ¿t as they come out of the NurÅ¿eries, that is, with the moÅ¿t part of their Branches on, and yet with but few Roots, that being ordinarily a means Å¿ure enough both to have Fruit quickly, and to have it good. But withal, it is as certain a way to have it but Å¿mall, to have but a little of it upon each <hi>Tree,</hi> and to have the <hi>Trees</hi> bear but a very little while, and to have them always grow in a ruÅ¿tick and miÅ¿erable Shape; to which, I add, That by Å¿uch an indiÅ¿creet greedineÅ¿s, and over-haÅ¿ty Method, they very often fall into the Å¿ame Inconvenience with <hi>AeÅ¿op</hi>'s Dog, who loÅ¿t all by Å¿natching after too much.</p>
                     <p>I confeÅ¿s IngenuouÅ¿ly, That I have a very particular AverÅ¿ion for ill favoured <hi>Trees,</hi> and conÅ¿equently for all thoÅ¿e haÅ¿ty Proceedings, that infallibly cauÅ¿e them to be Å¿uch. And eÅ¿pecially in a Garden that we would have agreeable for the goodneÅ¿s of its <hi>Trees,</hi> as well in <hi>Winter,</hi> when they are quite bare and Å¿tript, as in <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they are Å¿et out with their beÅ¿t Ornaments of Leaves and Fruits. For in Å¿uch a Garden, I Å¿hould not willingly conÅ¿ent to plant none but Å¿uch <hi>Trees,</hi> as either yield Fruit Å¿oon

                     <p>I very well know, That generally Å¿peaking, the Intention of all Planters is not only to have Fruits, but to have Å¿ome Å¿peedily; and they have reaÅ¿on; for I am Å¿o far of their Mind, that I could wiÅ¿h, that in this reÅ¿pect the Order of Nature would accomodate it Å¿elf to our DeÅ¿ires, Å¿o as to give us Fruit upon Trees that are Cut and Trimm'd, much Å¿ooner than Å¿he does, and particularly Å¿uch as are both fair and good: But alas! the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret never yet could be found, to make her in any conÅ¿iderable degree to advance her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pace, without Å¿poiling all; and therefore, though the Skill of the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> may in that caÅ¿e be of extraordinary AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, yet, after all, our beÅ¿t way is to be content to allow that wiÅ¿e Mother the time Å¿he takes of Four, Five or Six Years, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Kernel-fruits,</hi> which Å¿he performs on Å¿ome Trees Å¿ooner, and on Å¿ome latter; and to comfort our Å¿elves with the ConÅ¿ideration of the AÅ¿Å¿urance we have, That, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> in the Sequel Å¿he will amply recompenÅ¿e us for the Scarcity of thoÅ¿e preceding Years; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That to give us <hi>Stone-fruit,</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Grapes,</hi> Å¿he commonly requires leÅ¿s Time: For that, in effect, a Plantation of handÅ¿om and well ordered Trees of this latter Sort, Å¿eldom makes us Å¿tay above Three or Four Years without pleaÅ¿uring us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable Quantity of Fruit, to while us with in Expectation of a full crop in the Fifth or Sixth Years, and many Years after.</p>
                     <p>But in CaÅ¿e the ordinary Time of Å¿taying for <hi>Kernel-fruit</hi> Å¿eem too long, and the Party <note place="margin">What Method may be taken in Å¿pacious Gardens to have Fruit both Å¿oon and fair, while their principal Garden is growing to Perfection.</note> be a PerÅ¿on of Quality accommodated with great Gardens (for what I am going to AdviÅ¿e is not practicable in little ones) then I would willingly conÅ¿ent, That in Å¿ome by-place remote from the Principal Garden, he Å¿hould venture the Sacrificing of a good Number of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of the beÅ¿t Sorts of every SeaÅ¿on, Planting them whole and rough, as we have before hinted, and at Å¿mall diÅ¿tances one from the other, as in NurÅ¿ery-Gardens, that is to Å¿ay, about Two or Three Feet one from the other: For, being Å¿o ordered and well look'd after, they will pretty Å¿oon yield Å¿ome good Fruit, and tolerably fair too, which will be at the leaÅ¿t Å¿ome beginning of ConÅ¿olation, till Å¿uch time as the fine Garden Å¿hall be arrived to Perfection enough to play its part. I followed this Expedient in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>VerÅ¿ailes,</hi> as well for certain Fruits which in cold and moiÅ¿t <hi>Soils</hi> thrive not over well in the Form of <hi>Dwarf trees,</hi> as particularly for Å¿ome new Kinds, whoÅ¿e new Names rendring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, fired my CurioÅ¿ity with the greater Impatience to Å¿ee the Fruits of them, in which I Å¿ucceeded very well, as I did alÅ¿o in the joint Intention I had to arrive Å¿peedily to Å¿ome competent Abundance, and to raiÅ¿e by this means Å¿ome Tall <hi>Standard-trees,</hi> both laÅ¿ting and fair, of which I foreÅ¿aw I Å¿hould have need. However it is to be expected, that if Å¿uch Trees be kept too long in that manner, they will run great danger either of Dying, or at leaÅ¿t of infallibly becoming unfit to be removed to other Plantations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is for Å¿uch Curious PerÅ¿ons as are very Rich and Able, and that Plant Å¿pacious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to conÅ¿ult their own Inclinations upon the Point, and accordingly to reÅ¿olve whether they will pleaÅ¿e to be at a little the greater Expence, to attain by that means the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to taÅ¿te Fruit Å¿o much the Å¿ooner, or otherwiÅ¿e to have the Patience to Å¿tay Å¿omewhat longer for a Crop, with aÅ¿Å¿urance to have it with leÅ¿s Charge and much fairer, and in greater Abundance.</p>
                     <p>And though I have great reaÅ¿on to fear, the Preface of this Third Part, as NeceÅ¿Å¿ary as it is, may already have Å¿eem'd too long and tedious to new Beginners in theÅ¿e Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ities, who without doubt demand nothing more here but to know in all haÅ¿te which are thoÅ¿e choice Kinds of Trees they are to furniÅ¿h their Gardens with: Yet, by their leave, I muÅ¿t needs add Three Things more, before I can proceed to what will Å¿atisfie them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> I am to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h it for a certain Rule, That in all thoÅ¿e Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> where <note place="margin">The Effects of the Difference of <hi>Climates.</hi>
                        </note> the Cold and Heat are neither too long nor too violent, Nature having engaged her Å¿elf, as I may Å¿ay, in Å¿ome manner, to give us certain Kinds of Fruits in Å¿ome particular Months of the Year, it therefore conÅ¿tantly happens of CourÅ¿e, that thoÅ¿e Kinds of Fruits do once in the Year without fail come to Maturity there: But withal, I muÅ¿t tell you, That it is no leÅ¿s certain that this happens Å¿ooner in Å¿ome Places, and latter in others, that difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening from the different meaÅ¿ure of Heat that predominates in each place. Thus in the hotter Climates, the Fruits of each SeaÅ¿on ripen Å¿ooner than in the colder; and what is more, Å¿ome Fruits, and particularly Å¿ome Sorts of <hi>Figs, Peaches</hi> and <hi>Grapes</hi> ripen Å¿ooner in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than in the latter, which can never ripen at all in cold Regions. Which is the ReaÅ¿on why <hi>Italy, Provence, Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Guyenne,</hi> not only Å¿ee thoÅ¿e Fruits ripen in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> which we on the hither Å¿ide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> Å¿ee not arrive to Maturity before the Months of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> but beÅ¿ides have the peculiar Advantage to Å¿ee Å¿ome Sorts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48210:63"/>
of Fruits ripen with them, which for want of Å¿ufficient heat, never turn to Account in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>North.</hi> But then again, as it is true, That in thoÅ¿e <hi>Southern</hi> Provinces, all their <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> Fruits are almoÅ¿t paÅ¿t, when ours hardly yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ripen; Å¿o to be even with them, we are often in the Prime and Height of our Crops, in the time when they have nothing at all left:</p>
                     <p>We Å¿ee almoÅ¿t the Å¿ame Difference happen in one and the Å¿ame <hi>Climate,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of the Different Tempers of <hi>Soils</hi> and of Years, which, according as they are favoured with <note place="margin">As alÅ¿o of the Difference of <hi>Soils,</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Years in the Å¿ame <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>

To give you an Example of this Effect in hot <hi>Soils,</hi> it is obÅ¿erved, That the <hi>Soil</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> has ordinarily the Start of above Fifteen Days before that of <hi>VerÅ¿ailles;</hi> and for hot Years, that of 1688 was known to ripen us in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> thoÅ¿e Sorts of <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>MuÅ¿cats,</hi> that in the Years 1686 and 1687 came not to Maturity till after the middle of <hi>September.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Å¿uppoÅ¿es the Å¿ame Difference as to the early or backward Maturity of all the other Fruits of each Fruit Month in the Year: Generally <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> are the Months that decide the DeÅ¿tiny of each Å¿ort of Fruit for the time of their Maturity: And Curious Gentlemen that are Skilful, are to take their MeaÅ¿ures well upon that Foot, Å¿o as not to let their <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter-</hi>Fruits hang too long on the Trees in hot Years, nor to let themÅ¿elves be Å¿urprized by the ripeneÅ¿s of them, which ought not fully to come to thoÅ¿e <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter-</hi>fruits not to hang too long on the <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </note> Fruits till Å¿ome time after they are gathered and laid up. For 'tis certain there rots a great many of them after they are laid up, for want of being timely gathered; to prevent at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome part of which MiÅ¿chief, I Å¿hall elÅ¿ewhere preÅ¿cribe Å¿ome Remedies.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Article or Point, for which the <hi>MuÅ¿cat</hi> may Å¿erve for a Rule, is, for the knowing whether thoÅ¿e Fruits of the latter SeaÅ¿on Å¿hall comparatively ripen Å¿oon or late; for it is a moÅ¿t certain Mark, That in what Gardens Å¿oever, where the <hi>MuÅ¿cats</hi> ripen Å¿oon, that is to Å¿ay, about the End of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> or the Beginning of <hi>September,</hi> there the Year is forward; and, on the other Å¿ide, if they Ripen late, that is, towards the firÅ¿t of <hi>October,</hi> it is as Å¿ure a Å¿ign, that the Year is backward: So that, in Truth, I have found I might as Å¿ecurely govern my Å¿elf by this Rule, as any Mariner by his CompaÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd Thing I have to add, is, That we are to reckon Four diÅ¿tinct SeaÅ¿ons of <note place="margin">Four Å¿everal Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons of Fruits, and how reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Fruits; namely, <hi>1Å¿t,</hi> The <hi>Summer</hi> SeaÅ¿on, which begins in <hi>June,</hi> and finiÅ¿hes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September. 2dly,</hi> The <hi>Vacation</hi> SeaÅ¿on, or firÅ¿t <hi>Autumn,</hi> all which comprehends the firÅ¿t part of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and ends at <hi>Martelmas,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November.</hi> The <hi>3d,</hi> which begins where the laÅ¿t ends, and holds till about <hi>ChriÅ¿tmas,</hi> comprehending the latter part of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and may be called the Å¿econd <hi>Autumnal</hi> SeaÅ¿on. And the <hi>4th.</hi> and and laÅ¿t is that of <hi>Winter,</hi> which beginning in <hi>January,</hi> holds on till the appearance of the Red Fruits of the Month of <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, after having done with firÅ¿t and Å¿econd Things I had to propoÅ¿e, as I promiÅ¿ed in the Project of this Part, I am in the third place to Å¿pecifie to you, which are the principal Kinds of Fruit, not only of every of thoÅ¿e SeaÅ¿ons, but of each particular Month of which they are compoÅ¿ed: So that our DeÅ¿cription will be like a little Landskip in which may be Å¿een, with one caÅ¿t of an Eye, the whole Abridgment of all that can give PleaÅ¿ure in Matter of Gardening; and by that means, without any further DiÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion, we may be able perhaps of our own Heads, to determine what Choice to make of thoÅ¿e Kinds which we fancy beÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I Å¿hall run through all the Months in Particular, the more preciÅ¿ely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe to you what Fruits each of them claims to its Å¿hare, without omitting to mention Å¿o much as thoÅ¿e, that becauÅ¿e they grow not on Trees, Å¿uch as are <hi>Strawberries, RaÅ¿pberries, GooÅ¿eberries, Currans, Musk Melons, Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. are not within the compaÅ¿s of our preÅ¿ent Project. But I Å¿hall Å¿peak of them not in the Order commonly uÅ¿ed in the World, but according to that of the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive Maturity of their Fruits.</p>
                     <p>And accordingly, <hi>Summer</hi> Å¿hall be the firÅ¿t part of the Year with which I Å¿hall begin; <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Summer-</hi>SeaÅ¿on.</note> it being moÅ¿t true, That the <hi>Summer</hi> SeaÅ¿on is the firÅ¿t that can be Å¿aid any thing richly to entertain us with the new Productions of the <hi>Earth:</hi> And I dare affirm, That, in matter of Fruits, we may look upon that SeaÅ¿on as a kind of annual and fleeting Republick,

which from very Å¿mall beginnings at firÅ¿t, riÅ¿es in a very little time to a very conÅ¿iderable power, which yet is not of long continuance, becauÅ¿e no Å¿ooner is it eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd in its full Glory, but it begins to flag, and tend towards that Decay which Å¿oon after it Å¿inks into; though indeed it be not Å¿uch a Decay that brings with it an entire DeÅ¿truction, but only like a kind of <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> or Vacancy of Government, which is a Revolution it muÅ¿t Å¿uffer for Å¿ome Months, which being paÅ¿t over, its DeÅ¿tiny will make it reaÅ¿Å¿ume its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flouriÅ¿hing EÅ¿tate, and the Å¿ame ViciÅ¿Å¿itudes in which we have before Å¿een it, and through which, as I have Å¿aid above, it paÅ¿Å¿es conÅ¿tantly once every Year.</p>
                     <p>In diÅ¿courÅ¿ing of which, you are above all Things to take notice, That it will be <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>June.</hi>
                        </note> chiefly with reÅ¿pect to our own Climate, that I Å¿hall enter upon the particularities and upon the DiÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of the Å¿everal Sorts of Fruits each SeaÅ¿on. Accordingly to begin with the Fruits of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> I Å¿ay, and few People there are but know, that <hi>Straw-berries</hi> that begin to Ripen at the End of <hi>May,</hi> begin to be in great Plenty at the Entrance of <hi>June;</hi> and I add, that they are followed hard at the heels by the forward <hi>Cherries</hi> raiÅ¿ed upon <hi>Wall trees</hi> well plac'd, and that before the End of the Å¿ame Month, <hi>Currans GooÅ¿eberries, RaÅ¿pberries, Guignes</hi> and <hi>HaÅ¿ting-Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Griots</hi> too begin to fill the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; and, in fine, that the bedded <hi>Muskmelons,</hi> the forward <hi>Apricocks,</hi> and Å¿ome little <hi>MuÅ¿cat-pears</hi> upon <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> endeavour to Å¿hew us by Å¿ome little Samplers, the Riches which they altogether promiÅ¿e us in greater Abundance in the Month next immediately enÅ¿uring.</p>
                     <p>That is to Å¿ay, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> commonly, and not without ReaÅ¿on, called the <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>July.</hi>
                        </note> month of Red Fruits; For accordingly, till the Fifteenth or Twentieth Day of it, there continues to be a great Plenty of all the Kinds of that Fruit which were beginning to come in during the preceding Month; and when they draw to an end, the backward <hi>Cherries</hi> or <hi>Bigarros</hi> fail not to Å¿ucceed them, and to perform their Duty; during which Opportunity, the InduÅ¿try of DiÅ¿creet and Skilfull PerÅ¿ons that have the Care of them, by the help of Sugar which is at their Command, makes a moÅ¿t admirable uÅ¿e of all Å¿orts of Red Fruit under different Figures.</p>
                     <p>And here I Å¿hall not forget to tell you, That <hi>Muskmelons</hi> are, without Contradiction, <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>AuguÅ¿t.</hi>
                        </note> the Principal of all the Fruits of the SeaÅ¿on; and that beÅ¿ides, provided that in well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified <hi>Soils,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Wall Fig-trees</hi> be intermixed between the Boxes of the former, we may Å¿ee thoÅ¿e <hi>Muskmelons</hi> accompanied with a great Abundance of <hi>Figs;</hi> at the Å¿ame time may be expected Plenty of forward <hi>Peaches,</hi> of Yellow <hi>Plums,</hi> of little <hi>MuÅ¿cat</hi> and ordinary <hi>Apricocks,</hi> whilÅ¿t the <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Tall-trees</hi> or <hi>Standards</hi> Å¿hall Å¿trive with a Å¿eeming Emulation which Å¿hall preÅ¿ent us with the greateÅ¿t Numbers of <hi>Pears,</hi> called <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madams</hi> or <hi>Lady-thighs,</hi> of <hi>Maudlin-Pears,</hi> of the three Sorts of <hi>Blanquets,</hi> of <hi>haÅ¿ty RuÅ¿Å¿elets,</hi> of <hi>Bourdons, Muskat-Roberts, SkinleÅ¿s pears,</hi> and of many others of leÅ¿Å¿er Quality; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently, that we have a great deal of ReaÅ¿on to be very well Å¿atisfied with this Month of <hi>July.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we are once in <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> we are arrived, as I may Å¿ay, to the great Magazin of an infinite number of good Fruits. For in the beginning of this Month there continues Å¿till as great a Plenty as can be deÅ¿ired, both of <hi>Figs</hi> and backward <hi>Cherries,</hi> of <hi>Bigarros</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> as well on <hi>Wall-trees</hi> as on <hi>Standards;</hi> and by way of SurpluÅ¿age Å¿till to Å¿o many BleÅ¿Å¿ings, the unbedded <hi>Muskmelons</hi> begin to furniÅ¿h our Tables, and to bear Company with the bedded ones which laÅ¿t to the End of the Month. BeÅ¿ides all which, towards the End of the Å¿ame Month, we begin to have <hi>Pears</hi> of the following Sorts, <hi>viz. Robines,</hi> Summer musked <hi>Boncretiens, CaÅ¿Å¿oletts, EÅ¿pragnes</hi> or <hi>ReÅ¿erve-pears, Fondants de BreÅ¿t,</hi> or melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>BreÅ¿t, RuÅ¿Å¿eletts,</hi> &amp;c. And above all, this is the illuÅ¿trious and happy Month for the Fruits that charm me moÅ¿t, that is to Å¿ay, for certain <hi>Plums,</hi> which when in our Climates they have the good Fortune to be raiÅ¿ed upon <hi>Wall trees,</hi> may diÅ¿pute the Prize of Excellence with moÅ¿t Fruits of the SeaÅ¿on, or at leaÅ¿t may claim an equal place in our EÅ¿teem with the moÅ¿t Famed and AccompliÅ¿hed of them all. ThoÅ¿e <hi>Plums</hi> are the two Sorts of <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> white and violet; the <hi>Prune Royal,</hi> the Cloath of Gold <hi>Plum,</hi> the <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock Plum,</hi> the St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> the <hi>Diapred Violate,</hi> the <hi>Rouche Courbon,</hi> the <hi>Queen Claude,</hi> &amp;c. together with thoÅ¿e that thrive well enough upon <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, not only the moÅ¿t part of thoÅ¿e already named, but likewiÅ¿e all thoÅ¿e that bear the Title of Damask, and are of Five or Six FaÅ¿hions very different one from another, either in Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, Colour, Figure, or more or leÅ¿s early Maturity; there being of them the White, Black, Red, Violet, Grey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Å¿hall tell you by the by, That the grey Damask appears to me to be one of the principal Sorts; beÅ¿ides which the <hi>Mangerous,</hi> the <hi>Mirabelles</hi> and the <hi>Imperials, &amp;c.</hi> Å¿trive at this time which Å¿hall do beÅ¿t, and imitate the <hi>Wall-trees</hi> which now yield the

reÅ¿t of their Crop of <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches</hi> of <hi>Troy, RoÅ¿Å¿anne, Alberge</hi> and <hi>Cherry Peaches, &amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>Wall-trees</hi> begin alÅ¿o to give us Å¿ome <hi>Maudlin, Mignon</hi> and <hi>Bourdin Peaches,</hi> which are Å¿ometimes accompanied with the <hi>MuÅ¿cat,</hi> and forward or haÅ¿ty <hi>Grapes,</hi> as well black as white; and therefore none can diÅ¿pute but that this Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> is furniÅ¿hed with wherewithal to Å¿atisfie the moÅ¿t inÅ¿atiable, nice and difficult CurioÅ¿ity 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible to have.</p>
                     <p>But yet how Rich Å¿oever the foregoing Month has appear'd, I may for all that without Å¿cruple Å¿ay, That this of <hi>September</hi> is nothing inferior to it; for what almoÅ¿t does it not <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

That we Å¿hall not yet this pretty while perceive any Å¿enÅ¿ible diminution of Fruits, there remaining for a part of <hi>November</hi> many of thoÅ¿e that we Å¿aw Å¿ignalize themÅ¿elves towards the end of the foregoing Month; beÅ¿ides which, good <hi>Grapes</hi> will alÅ¿o laÅ¿t a good while, if care has been taken to gather them before the FroÅ¿ts, and to keep them carefully in the Fruit-lofts: For, being Å¿o ordered, they have as great a Privilege as any to appear at Noble Tables, though they be a little Å¿hriveled; it being not to be denied, but that they are always very good Å¿o long as they continue untainted with any Å¿peck of RottenneÅ¿s. The long <hi>MuÅ¿cat Grape</hi> is that whereof I moÅ¿t particularly Å¿peak here, it having the Gift to pleaÅ¿e the greateÅ¿t King in the World: And I that have the Honour to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and chief Manager of his <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> what ought I not to do, and indeed what do I leave unattempted for the finding out all means imaginable to furniÅ¿h him with that darling Fruit for Å¿everal Months together?</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides theÅ¿e, the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elas-Grapes</hi> both white and black, want not Patrons that highly praiÅ¿e them; for they have the advantage both to ripen and to keep much more eaÅ¿ily than the <hi>MuÅ¿cats.</hi> And becauÅ¿e, in Truth, they can hardly have the confidence to appear at the Å¿ame Table with the <hi>MuÅ¿cats,</hi> they wait till they are paÅ¿Å¿ed to triumph in their turn; and Å¿o theÅ¿e two Sorts of <hi>Grapes</hi> both do honour to the Month of <hi>November,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, the <hi>MuÅ¿cats</hi> in the beginning, and the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elats</hi> at the end; theÅ¿e latter laÅ¿ting the moÅ¿t part of the <hi>Advent-</hi>SeaÅ¿on. I add, That this Month is Å¿till Opulent and well Å¿tored with Miraculous <hi>Pears.</hi> For the Fruit-loft, if well Å¿tock'd, Å¿upplies it with a good part of thoÅ¿e that were Å¿o much in Fame at the end of <hi>October,</hi> it being accommodated with conÅ¿iderable remains of <hi>Bergamots, CraÅ¿annes, MarquiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>MarchioneÅ¿Å¿es, LanÅ¿acs, Petit-oins, &amp;c.</hi> And beÅ¿ides, this Month is the MaÅ¿ter and DiÅ¿penÅ¿er of very many other good <hi>Pears;</hi> for there are Å¿ome that begin to mellow in its time, and that is in Favour of thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Gardens are in a hot and dry <hi>Soil,</hi> or that, have <hi>Wall-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> the Å¿ame <hi>Pears</hi> otherwiÅ¿e Å¿taying longer to contribute to the good Fortune of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> for their Commodity whoÅ¿e Gardens are in a little more fattiÅ¿h and coldiÅ¿h <hi>Soil:</hi> And theÅ¿e kinds of <hi>Pears</hi> are, the <hi>EÅ¿pine</hi> or <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erees, Ambrets, St. Germains, PaÅ¿tourells, St. AuguÅ¿tins, Virgoulees, &amp;c.</hi> And for thoÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons too that love <hi>Pears</hi> that break Å¿hort in the Mouth, and Å¿uch as are musk'd, this Month of <hi>November</hi> preÅ¿ents them with <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Boncretiens, Amadots,</hi> dry <hi>Martins,</hi> Winter <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets,</hi> which are all tolerably good <hi>Pears,</hi> though not Å¿o Excellent as thoÅ¿e which are tender, or, as 'twere, Buttered.</p>

                        </note> becauÅ¿e being a Month confining upon <hi>November</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> and coming between both, it is in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of an ample Å¿hare of the greateÅ¿t part of the Riches of both Months; and conÅ¿equently it may truly be Å¿aid, That its condition is none of the worÅ¿t, eÅ¿pecially in Years that are a little backward; nay, and as I have already told you elÅ¿ewhere, we have very often reaÅ¿on to complain, that the principal Fruits of the SeaÅ¿on mellow too faÅ¿t to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this Month; it making a very great many of them grow Å¿oft and rotten, as if in effect their DeÅ¿tiny would not permit them to paÅ¿s any further.</p>

                     <p>One may in Å¿ome Å¿ort Å¿ay, That in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> and Å¿till more in the Month <note place="margin">Fruits of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, March</hi> and <hi>April.</hi>
                        </note> of <hi>March,</hi> the low Ebb of the Empire of Fruits begins in EarneÅ¿t, it being now fallen into a terrible abject State; for beÅ¿ides dry and liquid Sweet-meats, and <hi>Lemons,</hi> and <hi>Apples,</hi> and what we call baking or Å¿tewing <hi>Pears,</hi> namely, the <hi>Double flowers, Donvills</hi> and <hi>Angoberts, &amp;c.</hi> which both in this Month and all along after, till the coming of <hi>May-Strawberries,</hi> make up almoÅ¿t all the Furniture of the DeÅ¿arts, what have we elÅ¿e left but Å¿ome St. <hi>Lezins,</hi> which are but little worth, and Å¿ome <hi>Bugy-pears,</hi> which yet are not Å¿o much to be Å¿lighted, Å¿ince the <hi>Lent-</hi>SeaÅ¿on makes up with them a part of its beÅ¿t days? But particularly there Å¿till is left us a certain kind of thoÅ¿e Famous <hi>Pears</hi> that bear the venerable Name of <hi>Boncretiens,</hi> which, as it cannot but be unanimouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿Å¿ed, are capable alone gloriouÅ¿ly and happily to terminate the Campaign</p>
                     <p>I Å¿hall not fail in another place to lay before you what muÅ¿t needs produce in you a great ConÅ¿ideration for them, but at preÅ¿ent I Å¿hall only content my Å¿elf with telling you, That, if I may be permitted Å¿o to Å¿peak, we are to look upon them to be, as 'twere, the Rear-guard and Body of ReÅ¿erve of the Army of Fruits newly disbanded; for, in effect, that great number of other Fruits having for the Å¿pace of Eight or Nine Months, fought againÅ¿t and exterminated that Sterility that would have oppreÅ¿Å¿ed us without their AÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and being at laÅ¿t diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ed, the <hi>Boncretien</hi> remains alone, being, as it Å¿eems, the General, who with a Å¿mall number of Subaltern Officers, gently retires to take up his Winter Quarters in Expectation of new Recruits for another Expedition.</p>
                     <p>But I am afraid 'tis not enough to have told you what Å¿orts of Fruits are to be had in every Month, there remaining, methinks, one thing Å¿till very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be treated of, and that is to Å¿hew you with Å¿ome tolerable ExactneÅ¿s, how long the Fruit of any Tree whatÅ¿oever will ordinarily hold out in Å¿pending, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the Trees reaÅ¿onably well loaded; becauÅ¿e, unleÅ¿s that be known, it will be hardly poÅ¿Å¿ible to regulate what number of Trees one may, within a Å¿mall matter over or under, need, to furniÅ¿h one with a handÅ¿om proviÅ¿ion of them, without troubling ones Å¿elf to Plant a Å¿uperfluity of Trees,</p>
                     <p>Upon which, I tell you, that we may Å¿ay Å¿uch a Tree is well loaded, if, for Example, one <hi>Wall Peach-tree</hi> yield Fifty great <hi>Peaches,</hi> and one <hi>Dwarf Pear-tree</hi> bear Fifty large <hi>Pears;</hi> and if of <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> of a midling bigneÅ¿s, each <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> or <hi>Standard</hi> bear about the quantity of Two hundred a piece; and of <hi>Figs</hi> in Boxes, one Box yields two or three Dozen, and if of the Å¿ame, one <hi>Wall</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-</hi>Stock yeilds about a Hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It being certain that as in the firÅ¿t Years of their bearing, all theÅ¿e Sorts of Trees yield much leÅ¿s, Å¿o when they grow to their juÅ¿t bigneÅ¿s, and the Years prove good, they bear ordinarily much more Fruit than the proportion I have Å¿pecified.</p>
                     <p>This then being EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for a Rule, I Å¿hall next obÅ¿erve to you, That Experience further teaches us theÅ¿e Three Things; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That Regularly the Fruits of the good <hi>Wall-trees</hi> of every Garden ripen a little before thoÅ¿e of <hi>Standards;</hi> and theÅ¿e again Å¿omething before thoÅ¿e that grow on <note place="margin">Precedence of Maturity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions.</note>

III. In fine, The third Thing that Experience teaches us in matter of Fruits, is, That <note place="margin">The ordinary laÅ¿ting of the Fruits of every Å¿ort of Tree. And <hi>firÅ¿t</hi> of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-</hi>Fruits. Secondly, of thoÅ¿e of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn;</hi> and,</note> as to thoÅ¿e <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits that are to be gathered as faÅ¿t as they ripen; a <hi>Peach-tree,</hi> a <hi>Plum-tree,</hi> a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> a <hi>Pear-tree, &amp;c.</hi> yield Fruit for Ten or Twelve Days, and Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never paÅ¿s that time: and as for thoÅ¿e <hi>Pears</hi> which uÅ¿e to be laid up in the Fruit-lofts, of which the firÅ¿t are thoÅ¿e that are eaten in the Beginning of <hi>Autumn;</hi> as namely, the <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> the <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long green-pears,</hi> the <hi>Bergamots, &amp;c.</hi> each of thoÅ¿e Kinds laÅ¿t about Fifteen or Twenty Days at moÅ¿t, the different Figures of thoÅ¿e Trees, and the different <hi>Soils,</hi> and different ExpoÅ¿itions in which they are Planted, lengthening or Å¿hortning a little Duration of their Fruit.</p>
                     <p>As for the Fruits that are for the Å¿pending both during the End of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and all the <note place="margin">Thirdly, of the Fruits of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter SeaÅ¿on, and of Winter.</note> whole <hi>Winter,</hi> which though, what Kinds of Trees Å¿oever they be gathered from, are commonly laid up promiÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly together, People only contenting themÅ¿elves with laying each Kind of Fruit in Å¿eparate Heaps by themÅ¿elves; yet PerÅ¿ons that are very Curious, Å¿uch as I am, are Å¿o accurate as to Å¿eparate even the Fruits of one and the Å¿ame Kind into different heaps, laying the Fruit of one Tree of them in one place, and that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another, according to the differences of the Figures of their Trees, and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ExpoÅ¿itions, that they may the more preciÅ¿ely know when each of them mellows. Now, I Å¿ay, of theÅ¿e Kinds that are for the Å¿pending, as well of the End of <hi>Autumn,</hi> as of the whole <hi>Winter;</hi> there are Å¿ome that furniÅ¿h you for a Months Å¿pending, Å¿uch for the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> are the <hi>Pears</hi> called the <hi>CraÅ¿anne,</hi> the <hi>MarchioneÅ¿s,</hi> the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire-John,</hi> the <hi>Green Å¿ugar,</hi> the <hi>Vine pear,</hi> the <hi>LanÅ¿ac,</hi> the <hi>Flowered MuÅ¿cat, &amp;c.</hi> And others that afford a Å¿upply for five or Å¿ix Weeks, Å¿uch as are for the End of <hi>October</hi> and part of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonnes</hi> or good <hi>LouiÅ¿es,</hi> the <hi>Petit-oins,</hi> the <hi>Thorn pears,</hi> the dry <hi>Martins, &amp;c.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again there are that Å¿upply us for near Two Months, as the <hi>Virgoulees,</hi> the <hi>Ambrets,</hi> the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries,</hi> the <hi>PaÅ¿tourelles,</hi> the <hi>St. AuguÅ¿tins, St. Germains,</hi> and above all the <hi>Thorn-Pears</hi> may laÅ¿t part of <hi>November</hi> and all <hi>December.</hi> LaÅ¿tly, Some endure till <hi>January,</hi> as the <hi>Colmars</hi> and the <hi>Boncretiens,</hi> that may laÅ¿t all <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> and likewiÅ¿e the <hi>St. Lezins</hi> and <hi>Bugis</hi> that are able to Å¿upply us both in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From hence we may conclude, That, for Example, if a curious Gentleman have in <hi>Summer</hi> time a competent Number of fine Trees of each Kind, and for <hi>Peaches, Plums, Figs, &amp;c.</hi> have Å¿ome <hi>Wall-trees</hi> in all the Å¿everal ExpoÅ¿itions; and for <hi>Pears, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. have Å¿ome others, in both the Å¿everal Forms of <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> provided the Trees be of a full Age to bear, Å¿uch a PerÅ¿on may reckon that about Twenty Days he Å¿hall be reaÅ¿onably well Å¿upplied with Fruits of each Kind. For, for Example, if he have three fine <hi>Wall-Minion-Peach-trees,</hi> Å¿uch as they ought to be after three, four or five Years Planting at furtheÅ¿t, one towards the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> another toward the <hi>South,</hi> and a third towards the <hi>WeÅ¿t;</hi> theÅ¿e three fine <hi>Peach-trees</hi> may Å¿upply him with that kind of Fruit for three Weeks together, and yield him in that time about a hundred and Fifty fair <hi>Peaches,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, Å¿even or eight a day; and conÅ¿equently he may have Three hundred, which is at the rate of Fifteen or Sixteen a Day, from Å¿ix <hi>Peach-trees;</hi> which is no over great Number of Trees of the Å¿ame Kind; and he may have no leÅ¿s than Six hundred from Twelve Trees, which is at the rate of about Thirty a Day; and that is a very Noble ProviÅ¿ion; the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid as to the <hi>Mandlin, ChevreuÅ¿e, Admirable, Violet</hi> and <hi>Nivete-peaches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And if from Å¿o moderate a Å¿upputation, we may expect Å¿uch a conÅ¿iderable TreaÅ¿ure of <hi>Peaches,</hi> with much greater ReaÅ¿on, what may we not look for from double, treble or quadruple the Number of Trees of thoÅ¿e Å¿ame Kinds of good Fruits? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, two <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet</hi> or two <hi>Robine pear-trees,</hi> whether they be <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Standards,</hi> when they are come to the Age of four, five or Å¿ix Years, and have been always carefully trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cultivated, may be able both together, to furniÅ¿h us for at leaÅ¿t Fifteen Days, and in that time to give us Two or Three hundred <hi>Pears;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, about Twenty a Day, and conÅ¿equently four <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets</hi> or four <hi>Robine-trees,</hi> will yield us Five or Six hundred of each Å¿ort, being about Forty a Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> LikewiÅ¿e two and four <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of what SeaÅ¿on Å¿oever they be, will yield us of each Kind in particular, a like ProviÅ¿ion, which is always to be underÅ¿tood of thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of Fruits that are not very big.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ame Thing alÅ¿o holds in the great Fruits of the beginning of <hi>Autumn.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as to <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> two great <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of that Figure will in Fifteen Days time, furniÅ¿h us near One hundred fine <hi>Pears,</hi> and Four will give us near Two hundred, that is to Å¿ay, about Fourteen or Fifteen a Day: And for <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> two and four <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots</hi> of that Figure will produce no leÅ¿s: In like manner for the Fruits of the latter SeaÅ¿on, Two and Four <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of <hi>CraÅ¿Å¿annes, MarchioneÅ¿Å¿es, Thorn-pears, Virgoules, St. Germains, St. AuguÅ¿tins, Ambrets, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries,</hi> &amp;c. as alÅ¿o Two and Four <hi>Wall-Boncretien-pears</hi> will

yeild the Å¿ame quantity in proportion.

                     <p>I Å¿ay nothing of the Red Fruits whoÅ¿e Product is meaÅ¿ured either by the pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight, or by Baskets heap-full, becauÅ¿e there is no Body but knows how to gueÅ¿s well enough at them: All the World likewiÅ¿e knows what is the uÅ¿ual IncreaÅ¿e of a Bed of <hi>Strawberries,</hi> a Tuft of <hi>RaÅ¿pberry-buÅ¿hes,</hi> and of <hi>Curran</hi> or <hi>GooÅ¿eberry-Å¿hrubs,</hi> or of a forward <hi>Wall Cherry-tree,</hi> or of a Standard <hi>Cherry-Agriot</hi> or <hi>Bigaro-tree.</hi> It is alÅ¿o well enough known, That one <hi>Musk-melon</hi> plant furniÅ¿hes ordinarily but Two or Three <hi>Melons,</hi> but that a one <hi>Cowcumber-</hi>plant produces of that Fruit Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively Two dozen or more.</p>
                     <p>Our Curious new Planters then having made upon this Foot, a pretty Å¿upputation of the Product of each Å¿ort of Fruit, may eaÅ¿ily Judge how many Stocks or Plants they Å¿hall need to Plant of every of them, without blindly engaging themÅ¿elves in the Trouble and Charge of two great a multitude.</p>

It is eaÅ¿ie to find a colourable ExcuÅ¿e for the ExceÅ¿Å¿ive curioÅ¿ity of Travellers, for that when they are once upon the Way to Å¿ee Things, they may at little Charge, and in little time, inform themÅ¿elves generally of all Things, Å¿o that no perÅ¿on whatÅ¿oever Å¿hall be able afterwards to impoÅ¿e upon them, or thwart them concerning Things not Å¿een: But in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fruits, the itching DeÅ¿ire to have all Å¿orts of them, is a DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿o much the harder to cure, becauÅ¿e inÅ¿tead of being look'd upon as Å¿uch, it Å¿eems on the contrary to have all the inciting Charms of a Å¿ingular Perfection: And in earneÅ¿t, thoÅ¿e poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen greatly move my pity, becauÅ¿e they will never be at quiet, till they have Å¿pent a great deal of Time and Money, only to know at laÅ¿t by a long Experience attended with a great deal of Vexation, That there are ten times more kinds of Fruits fit only to be flighted, than there are good and deÅ¿erving enough to be cultivated, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have been forewarned of it by Å¿ome underÅ¿tanding Friend, but have not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his CounÅ¿el.</p>
                     <p>How happy had I been, if during thoÅ¿e many years that I was Å¿erving my Apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip in this Art, under the Conduct only of my own Head, I had met with an able Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to Guide me? For, above all Things, I Å¿hould moÅ¿t have needed one to cure me of a kind of mad Fancy one has commonly for that which they call <hi>New Fruits,</hi> though very often they prove nothing elÅ¿e but Å¿ome common Å¿orts diÅ¿guiÅ¿ed under new Names; which is an unhappineÅ¿s cauÅ¿ed partly by the ignorance of Å¿ome People, and partly by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Å¿ome fantaÅ¿tical preÅ¿umptuous Pretenders; who, out of a vain deÅ¿ire to be thought richer in Å¿uch CurioÅ¿ities than they are, endeavour by this Artifice, to Å¿tir up people to Court them for Å¿ome Å¿hare of them.</p>
                     <p>And now, for my part, it Å¿hall be none of my fault, if all perÅ¿ons that are curious in Gardening, avoid not all the Å¿helves by which I have paÅ¿Å¿ed, and take not at the very firÅ¿t Å¿etting out, the Å¿horteÅ¿t and beÅ¿t way that can be taken in this Matter; which is aÅ¿Å¿uredly of a vaÅ¿t Extent, and the number of PerÅ¿ons that have loÅ¿t their way there, is infinite.</p>

                           <p>In the Å¿econd place, the Great and IlluÅ¿trious Name which it has ever born ever Å¿ince <note place="margin">Its Modern Name.</note> Å¿o many Ages, and with which it Å¿eems to have been baptized at the very Birth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tianity it Å¿elf; how can it but imprint in all a Veneration for it, and eÅ¿pecially in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian Gardeners?</p>
                           <p>In the third Place, To conÅ¿ider it in its Å¿elf, that is to Å¿ay, with reÅ¿pect only to its own proper Merit, which is that which is particularly in QueÅ¿tion, and can only intitle it to a preference in this place; it muÅ¿t be confeÅ¿Å¿ed, That among Kernel-Fruits, Nature preÅ¿ents us nothing Å¿o Beautiful, nor Å¿o Noble to behold as this <hi>Pear,</hi> whether we conÅ¿ider <note place="margin">The DeÅ¿cription and PraiÅ¿es of this <hi>Pear.</hi>
                              </note> its Å¿hape which is long and pyramidical, or its bigneÅ¿s, which is prodigious, as being for Example three or four Inches thick, and five or Å¿ix long, and very commonly of a pound weight or more, nay, and Å¿ometimes exceeding two pounds, which is certainly a truth of rare and Å¿ingular Remark: Or particularly, if we caÅ¿t our Eyes upon its lively Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Colour, with which the ground of its natural Yellow is Å¿o charmingly Å¿et off, when it grows in a favourable Sun and advantageous ExpoÅ¿ition, that it attracts the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the whole World: Add to this, That it is the <hi>Pear</hi> which of all others gives the longeÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ure, as well upon the Tree, upon which it continues Å¿till increaÅ¿ing to the view of the Eye from <hi>May</hi> till the End of <hi>October,</hi> as in the Fruit-Magazine; where eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preÅ¿erving its Å¿elf for four or five Months together, it daily pleaÅ¿ures the Å¿ight of the Curious that have a mind to look upon it, as much as the view of a Jewel or a TreaÅ¿ure rejoyces the MaÅ¿ter that poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es it.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48210:67"/>
laÅ¿tly, it is the <hi>Pear</hi> for the Beauty of which, the ableÅ¿t Gard'ners have always Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greateÅ¿t PaÅ¿Å¿ion, and that which yields the greateÅ¿t profit to thoÅ¿e which Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate it only to expoÅ¿e to Sale. It is always very good Å¿tewed or baked, when People have a mind to eat of it a little before 'tis full ripe, and it cannot be denied but it is moÅ¿t Excellent when we give it time to mellow, if it come out of a Garden where the <hi>Soil</hi> is naturally good, or, at leaÅ¿t, well Cultivated; and it has this Advantage over and above, That its mellowneÅ¿s is not like that of the moÅ¿t part of the <hi>Butter-fruits,</hi> which paÅ¿Å¿es, as one may Å¿ay, like Lightning; Å¿o that thoÅ¿e Sorts of Fruits are no Å¿ooner mellow, but they grow Å¿oft and pappy, and degenerate into RottenneÅ¿s; whereas the mellowneÅ¿s of each <hi>Boncretien-pear</hi> continues to maintain it Å¿elf in Vigour for Å¿ome whole Months together, as if Å¿eemed with Patience to wait the time when we Å¿hall be pleaÅ¿ed to do it the Honour to Employ it to thoÅ¿e UÅ¿es for which Nature deÅ¿ign'd it.</p>
                           <p>'Tis true indeed, That in the Order I have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed for the Excellence of <hi>Pears,</hi> the firÅ¿t degree of GoodneÅ¿s is altogether wanting to this, becauÅ¿e it is not Buttery; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently it may Å¿eem, that becauÅ¿e here our BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s is to give the firÅ¿t Rank to that Å¿ort of <hi>Pears</hi> only, that can vaunt it Å¿elf to have the moÅ¿t Excellent TaÅ¿te, I Å¿hould not grant it to this which, by my own ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, is but in the Å¿econd ClaÅ¿s of good Ones.</p>
                           <p>But though it has not the firÅ¿t degree of GoodneÅ¿s, it is certain, it wants not the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; that is to Å¿ay, a Pulp that eats Å¿hort, and is often tender enough, with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able TaÅ¿te, and a Å¿weet Å¿ugred Juice, indifferently abundant, and a little perfum'd; from the ConÅ¿ideration of which, without doubt, it was that our Fathers, to make a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinction between that and other <hi>Pears,</hi> added to its Name the Epithet of <hi>Good,</hi> without doing the Å¿ame Thing in Favour of any other <hi>Pear;</hi> which additional Name has remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it every where in all Countries, but only in <hi>Poitou,</hi> where the People content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves with calling it only the <hi>ChriÅ¿tian-pear.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And, beÅ¿ides all the Advantages above-mentioned, it has likewiÅ¿e this, which appears to me a very great one, that is, when all other <hi>Pears</hi> are paÅ¿t, this Å¿till remains to Honour our Tables till the new Fruits of the Spring; and, by conÅ¿equence, protracts even Å¿o far as that time, the pleaÅ¿ure of thoÅ¿e that love raw Fruit. All which Å¿umm'd up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, excites in me Å¿o much ConÅ¿ideration for the <hi>Good ChriÅ¿tian</hi> or <hi>Boncretien-pear,</hi> that I think I Å¿hould do a kind of InjuÅ¿tice if I Å¿hould refuÅ¿e it the Place of a FirÅ¿t <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I know very well it pleaÅ¿es not all the World, and that it is Å¿lighted by certain People, that accuÅ¿e it to have commonly a Pulp or FleÅ¿h, that is tough and Å¿trong, or, at leaÅ¿t, not very fine.</p>
                           <p>To which I anÅ¿wer, That thoÅ¿e are general AccuÅ¿ations, and Å¿uch as may in a manner be made againÅ¿t all Å¿orts of Fruits; it being but too true, that we are not to expect to find any that are abÅ¿olutely perfect, and therefore accordingly we call only thoÅ¿e good Fruits which have the feweÅ¿t Defects. I will not deny but that among <hi>Boncretien pears,</hi> there may be Å¿ome that may deÅ¿erve the Reproach caÅ¿t on them by thoÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons; but, in my Opinion, they deÅ¿erve it not always by their own Fault, Å¿ince it is true there very often are found moÅ¿t excellent Ones among them; and therefore thoÅ¿e Defects, when found in theÅ¿e <hi>Pears,</hi> are rather to be attributed to the badneÅ¿s of the <hi>Soil</hi> in which they grew, as not being proper for the producing of good Fruits, or of their ExpoÅ¿ition, as being Planted in a Quarter not bleÅ¿Å¿ed with a favourable AÅ¿pect from the Sun; or to the Negligence or UnskilfulneÅ¿s of the Gard'ner, who took not Å¿ufficient care of them, or to the over haÅ¿tineÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e that needs will be Å¿erving them up before they are come to a fit Maturity.</p>
                           <p>I know very well too, There are a great many PerÅ¿ons that think a <hi>Boncretien</hi> can never prove good upon a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> and that 'tis abÅ¿olutely impoÅ¿Å¿ible to have any fine ones unleÅ¿s it be upon <hi>Wall-trees;</hi> and therefore, that they will highly condemn me for chuÅ¿ing it for the firÅ¿t to be Planted in a Scituation which they pretend directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. But though I do ingenuouÅ¿ly grant it true, That the <hi>Boncretien</hi> Å¿ucceeds beÅ¿t upon a <hi>Wall-tree,</hi> eÅ¿pecially in acquiring that Vermilion that Å¿o well becomes it, and which the full Air on a <hi>Standard-tree</hi> cannot give it in Å¿uch Perfection, yet I believe I have hitherto pretty well Å¿ucceeded in diÅ¿abuÅ¿ing a great number of Curious PerÅ¿ons of the falÅ¿e ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion they had againÅ¿t a <hi>Boncretien</hi> upon a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> by Å¿hewing them by the certain Experience of Å¿everal Years, eÅ¿pecially in Gardens of a midling Extent, well cloÅ¿ed and Å¿heltred from the great Colds, either by good Walls of their own, or by Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Buildings, and which conÅ¿equently are in a good ExpoÅ¿ition, and advantaged beÅ¿ides with a <hi>Soil</hi> indifferently good, either by Nature or by the help of Art; that upon Trees

of that Figure may be raiÅ¿ed very goodly <hi>Boncretien pears;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, very great ones well Å¿haped with a good fine Skin, a little bluÅ¿hed on that Å¿ide next the Sun, and in the reÅ¿t of their Bodies, of a green proper to take a yellow as they grow ripe; and, in a Word, very Excellent <hi>Pears,</hi> and Å¿uch as few <hi>Wall trees</hi> were Å¿een able to compare with.</p>
                           <p>And, to put an End to this ConteÅ¿tation, I think it not neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make here any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther AnÅ¿wers, than, in the firÅ¿t place, to invite our AdverÅ¿aries to go in <hi>Autumn</hi> and Å¿ee the <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in Å¿everal Gardens at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at <hi>Vernon,</hi> where they rear Å¿uch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The Differences of <hi>Soils</hi> and ExpoÅ¿itions, of dry and wet <hi>Summers,</hi> and of Vigour and WeakneÅ¿s in a Tree, whether it be in the whole Tree, or only in a part of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ThoÅ¿e Differences, I Å¿ay, cauÅ¿e theÅ¿e other little External Differences of Colour, Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Wall-tree</hi> will produce Fruit more golden than green, and the <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> more green than golden; and the Dwarf graffed upon a Free-Å¿tock will produce greener Fruit than that which is graffed upon a <hi>Quince-</hi>Å¿tock.</p>
                           <p>If the Tree be Å¿ick, whether it be young or old, it will bring Fruit without a Core, and upon that very Å¿ame Tree, if there be any vigorous Branch, as it often enough happens, there will be a Core in the Fruit that grows upon that vigorous Å¿ide, though there be none in the <hi>Pears</hi> that grow upon the infirm Branches; and if from that yellowiÅ¿h and languiÅ¿hing Å¿ide, a Branch be taken and graffed happily upon a Å¿ound and lively Stock, it will produce a Tree both green and brisk, which will Å¿hew not only the Conformity of its kind with that of other <hi>Boncretiens;</hi> but likewiÅ¿e its good Health, as well by the Core as the the green Colour of its <hi>Pear:</hi> Upon which occaÅ¿ion I Å¿hall tell you, That Å¿uch <hi>Boncretien-pears</hi> as grow yellow upon the Tree, and have a Skin that feels extraordinarily Å¿oft, are apt to have but a very indifferent goodneÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>A good Fruit-Branch will produce a <hi>Pear</hi> long and large, and a Fruit-Branch of a little more inferiour GoodneÅ¿s, will form its Fruit Å¿hort, flat and roundiÅ¿h: A good <hi>Soil</hi> gives it a fine Skin, and a delicate Pulp, whereas a fat and moiÅ¿t Earth renders its Skin rough, and the Pulp groÅ¿s and courÅ¿e.</p>
                           <p>They might as well make different kinds of great and little, of horned and crumpled, of well Å¿haped and well look'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would be a very ridiculous fancy, which is carefully to be avoided.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Winter-Boncretien</hi> then, Å¿uch a one, in a word, as is every where known by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons of Quality for Å¿uch, without ever changing its Name, as moÅ¿t other Fruits have done. This <hi>Boncretien,</hi> I Å¿ay, Å¿hould be then the <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> that I would Plant in a little Garden well qualified, where it Å¿hould be deÅ¿ign'd to Plant but only one <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree;</hi> and this Å¿ame <hi>Pear-tree</hi> Å¿hould be likewiÅ¿e the firÅ¿t I would chuÅ¿e, not only for a Garden in which I Å¿hould have room for a Å¿econd <hi>Dwarf,</hi> but alÅ¿o for all the other Gardens alike well qualified for it, in which I Å¿hould have room for many more Å¿uch Trees, and particularly if there were but little Walling for thoÅ¿e Trees that Å¿hould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned for that Station. And this <hi>Boncretien-tree</hi> Å¿hould firÅ¿t be graffed upon a <hi>Quince:</hi> Å¿tock, chiefly becauÅ¿e the <hi>Boncretien-Dwarfs</hi> graffed on <hi>Free-</hi>Å¿tocks, commonly bring Fruit

Å¿potted, Å¿mall, crumpled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And conÅ¿equently diÅ¿agreeable to the Å¿ight: In the Å¿econd place, it Å¿hould be Planted in that part of the Garden facing the <hi>Wall trees,</hi> neareÅ¿t the Wall expoÅ¿ed to the moÅ¿t favourable Sun; and laÅ¿tly, immediately after the End of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> I would have the leaves taken off that hindred the Sun from Å¿hining upon the Fruit, which are all Precautions extreamly important.</p>
                           <p>I am not yet Å¿peaking of thoÅ¿e Country Gardens that want all the good Qualities, and other good Conditions which we have newly deÅ¿cribed in reÅ¿pect to the ordering of Å¿mall Gardens, and which yet I could wiÅ¿h to all good Fruit <hi>Trees;</hi> for then I Å¿hould be of a very different Sentiment from that I declare my Å¿elf of here in regard to our <hi>Boncretien;</hi> for I would Plant but little of it there, unleÅ¿s it were in the Figure of <hi>Wall-trees;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reÅ¿olv'd, in fine, whatever it coÅ¿t, to Plant Å¿ome <hi>Boncretiens</hi> in all Å¿orts of Gardens, Å¿ince, in Truth, we have nothing better for the End of <hi>Winter,</hi> than this Noble Fruit.</p>

                           <p>Concerning the Choice of a Second <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree,</hi> and after that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Choice of a Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth of the Å¿ame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>NOW let us Å¿ee upon what <hi>Pear-tree</hi> our Choice will fall to be the Second <hi>Dwarf,</hi> as well of that little Garden where there can be but Two, as the Second of all others, where there is room for a greater Number; for truly it is a point not over-eaÅ¿ie to decide.</p>
                        <p>We have above all the reÅ¿t, Six different Å¿orts of <hi>Pears</hi> that put in briskly for this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, nay, and which can hardly brook without murmuring, that the <hi>Boncretien</hi> Å¿hould peaceably enjoy the Honour it has newly received, which are the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> the <hi>Autumn Bergamot,</hi> the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie,</hi> the <hi>Winter Ambret</hi> and <hi>Winter Thorn-pear:</hi> Nay, and beÅ¿ides there are, the ancient <hi>Petit-oin,</hi> the <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonne</hi> or <hi>Good LouiÅ¿e,</hi> with four new Commers, namely, the <hi>St. Germain,</hi> the <hi>Colmar,</hi> the <hi>CraÅ¿anne,</hi> and the <hi>MarquiÅ¿s</hi> or <hi>MarchioneÅ¿s,</hi> which finding themÅ¿elves provided with Å¿ufficient Merit, want not the Ambition to enter into this DiÅ¿pute, every one of theÅ¿e Twelve pretending Å¿everally to have more Perfections, and fewer Defects than any one of its Rivals, or, at leaÅ¿t, to be nothing inferior to them; and accordingly pretending too, to win from them the Place that is here in QueÅ¿tion.</p>
                        <p>And I grant, they all have Å¿uch powerful Motives for their Å¿everal Pretentions, that we cannot be cenÅ¿ured to have made an ill Choice to which of them Å¿oever we Å¿hall give the Preference: However, my Judgment is, That theÅ¿e Six laÅ¿t ought to retire for a time, and leave the Six firÅ¿t to fight out this Quarrel; and I Å¿hall give, if I be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿taken, Å¿uch good ReaÅ¿ons for it, that I hope their Patrons will be Å¿atisfied with them. But before I declare my Å¿elf for any one of theÅ¿e Six, it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to examine Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and without prejudice, all the Å¿everal ReaÅ¿ons pleaded by every one of them.</p>
                        <p>I begin with thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> concerning which I muÅ¿t firÅ¿t lay it down for a ConcluÅ¿ion, That as well the red <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e called the <hi>AmbroiÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>IÅ¿ambert</hi> of the <hi>Normans,</hi> as the grey <hi>Butter</hi> and green <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> are but one and the Å¿ame thing; for that oftentimes all theÅ¿e pretended Sorts are found upon one and the Å¿ame Tree, thoÅ¿e differences of Colour having no other Foundation in a manner than thoÅ¿e which we have remarked in the <hi>Boncretien;</hi> the fair ExpoÅ¿ition of them, or perhaps an indifferent weak Temper either in the whole Tree, or in any particular Branch, producing red <hi>Pears;</hi> and a Å¿hady Situation, and the vigour either of the whole Tree, or of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Branch of it, making grey or green ones: And the <hi>Quince</hi> and <hi>Free-Å¿tocks</hi> upon which theÅ¿e <hi>Pear-trees</hi> are graffed, Å¿hew themÅ¿elves by the different Colours with which they tinge their Fruit, the Colour of the Fruit of the <hi>Pear-trees</hi> on Free-Å¿tocks being quite another thing from that of the <hi>Boncretien</hi> graffed on a <hi>Quince-</hi>Å¿tock: BeÅ¿ides which, the dryneÅ¿s or moiÅ¿tneÅ¿s of the Soil in which they grow, fail not to imprint Å¿ome Marlts and Features of their own FaÅ¿hion.</p>
                        <p>This being firÅ¿t laid down as a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Remark, the ReaÅ¿ons of this <hi>Butter-pear</hi> are, <note place="margin">The DeÅ¿cription and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Butter-pear.</hi>
                           </note> firÅ¿t, That it is poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s'd in Å¿uch Perfection of the firÅ¿t Degree of GoodneÅ¿s, that is to be deÅ¿ired in Fruits, which is a Å¿mooth delicious melting SoftneÅ¿s, that the Name of <hi>Butter-pear</hi>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48210:68"/>
was for that Quality given it by way of Excellence; and, in effect, its name is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to give to others whoÅ¿e Merit we would Extol, and therefore this <hi>Pear</hi> believes to <note place="margin">The Conditions neceÅ¿Å¿ary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titute an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Pear.</hi>
                           </note> have Right to pretend, that not one of the other <hi>Pears</hi> Å¿hould diÅ¿pute with it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream abundance of Juice, nor for a fine and delicate Pulp, and rich TaÅ¿te, which are all the Conditions neceÅ¿Å¿ary to conÅ¿titute an excellent <hi>Pear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd Place, it pretends to have the advantage to charm the Å¿ight, as well by the bigneÅ¿s of its Body, as the goodlineÅ¿s of its Figure, and Beauty of its Colour.</p>
                        <p>In the third place it is perÅ¿waded, It may hope all Things from the HappineÅ¿s it has to be extreamly fertile; Å¿o that commonly every Year, and in all Å¿orts of Ground it is loaden almoÅ¿t ready to break, and Å¿ucceeds as well upon a Free-Å¿tock, as upon a Quince one, and almoÅ¿t as well under the Hands of Ignorant as of Able Gard'ners; beÅ¿ides, that it is Å¿eldom or never apt to be Doughy, InÅ¿ipid and Mealy, as are moÅ¿t other tender <hi>Pears,</hi> and that not only, it is not Å¿o incommoded by the full Air as the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> but alÅ¿o bears Å¿ooner than the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> and produces fairer Fruit than any of its Competitors. Here are without doubt a great many ReaÅ¿ons, and all of great Weight and Authority, Å¿trongly to prove and confirm the right of the <hi>Butter-pears</hi> claim in this CauÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>Nay, its Friends would fain believe further, That if the <hi>Butter pear</hi> could be had at all SeaÅ¿ons of the Years, and we could cure our Å¿elves of the natural CurioÅ¿ity we have for Change, and for the Variety of Fruits, that in that caÅ¿e, we ought not to think of any other than this Famous <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> it being certain, That it is really Å¿o Excellent, that by the ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of all, at the End of <hi>September</hi> when it begins to ripen, we are well enough content to Å¿ee the <hi>Peaches</hi> paÅ¿s away, which is to Å¿ay, a great deal in its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Autumn Bergamot</hi> making no great Account of all that has juÅ¿t now been Å¿aid in <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Autumn Bergamot,</note> Favour of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> preÅ¿ents it Å¿elf to Å¿top this QueÅ¿tion of Precedence from being Å¿o Å¿oon decided: Its Party is very numerous and formidable, which is as much as to Å¿ay, its Excellence is very much known: And indeed I Å¿ee a ThouÅ¿and People that aÅ¿Å¿ert, <note place="margin">Its DeÅ¿cription and Character.</note> That if it be conÅ¿idered with reÅ¿pect to all the Ingredient Parts of its GoodneÅ¿s; that is to Å¿ay, its tender and melting Pulp, its Å¿weet and Å¿ugred Juice, and the little Å¿mack of Perfume that accompanies it, it is more valuable than all the other <hi>Pears</hi> in general; they alÅ¿o affirm, That FruitfulneÅ¿s is not much leÅ¿s on the <hi>Bergamots</hi> Å¿ide, than on that of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> Å¿ince it is ordinarily loaded with a Å¿ufficient abundance, and Å¿o quickly repays the pains of thoÅ¿e that Cultivate it. Add to this, that contrary to what we find by the Experience we have of almoÅ¿t all other Fruits, it may be Å¿aid in its Favour, and with Truth, That a midling <hi>Bergamot-pear</hi> is as good as the biggeÅ¿t, nay, and that very often it is the midling one that is the moÅ¿t Excellent, though it may have appeared to be the moÅ¿t deÅ¿piÅ¿able, which Advantage ought to be eÅ¿teemed as a Å¿ingular and conÅ¿iderable Argument in its Favour. This <hi>Pear</hi> commonly uÅ¿es to furniÅ¿h the End of <hi>October</hi> and part of <hi>November,</hi> and Å¿ometimes paÅ¿Å¿es on as far as <hi>December,</hi> which gives a wonderful PleaÅ¿ure to our Curious Gentlemen; Å¿o that, in truth, we had need to provide our Å¿elves with Trees of them in different ExpoÅ¿itions, in divers Å¿orts of Ground, and upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stocks; that is to Å¿ay, Graffed upon Free-Å¿tocks, and upon <hi>Quince-</hi>Å¿tocks, and in the various Figures of <hi>Dwarf-trees, Wall-trees,</hi> and even of <hi>Standards</hi> too, the better to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the Inclination this <hi>Pear</hi> Å¿eems to have, to entertain us Å¿everal Months together.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hall note by the by, That you are not to believe there is any other difference in <hi>Bergamot-pears</hi> (I man thoÅ¿e of <hi>Autumn</hi> and not of <hi>Summer)</hi> but what conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour only, but then that difference is real; for indeed there is one of a greeniÅ¿h grey, which is Å¿imply named the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> or the <hi>Common Bergamot,</hi> or the <hi>Pear de la Hiliere,</hi> or <hi>de Recous, &amp;c.</hi> they all Å¿ignifying but one thing; and there is another that is Å¿trip'd with yellow and green Å¿treaks, which makes it be called the <hi>SuiÅ¿Å¿e-Bergamot,</hi> this motley Colour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at the Å¿ame time both in the Wood and in the Fruit; but as to their internal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, it Å¿eems to me to be equal both in the one and the other, when they are both as good as they Å¿hould be; they alÅ¿o agree together in the Å¿ame proportion of bigneÅ¿s, which is Å¿ometimes of three Inches Diameter in thickneÅ¿s, but moÅ¿t commonly but of one and a half or two Inches; they likewiÅ¿e agree both in having a flattiÅ¿h Å¿hape, and an Eye or Crown Å¿inking hollow in, and a Å¿hort and Å¿mall Stalk, and poliÅ¿h'd and yellowiÅ¿h Skin, and a little moiÅ¿tiÅ¿h when it is ripe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Would to God it were true, there were a Å¿ort of <hi>Latter Bergamots,</hi> or otherwiÅ¿e <hi>Lent Bergamots,</hi> and that every Year we could be Å¿ure to have Å¿ome of them till the End of <hi>March,</hi> as Å¿ometimes it happens; for in that caÅ¿e we might have juÅ¿t Grounds to brag, that we had for, at leaÅ¿t, four or five Months in the Year, the real TreaÅ¿ure of Fruits.</p>

Some certain curious PerÅ¿ons would fain have perÅ¿waded themÅ¿elves and me too, that they infallibly had this Å¿ort of latter <hi>Bergamots;</hi> but to my great regret, I cannot forbear confeÅ¿Å¿ing, that to this preÅ¿ent time I have not been able to convince my Å¿elf that I have attained any Å¿uch good Fortune, although in truth I have been wanting neither in Care, nor Diligence, nor in any other Precaution that might contribute to the making a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t of that Importance; for what have I attempted for that End, what in Pains and what in Expences, is inÅ¿inite as well as to no purpoÅ¿e, and the particular Account and Relation of it would be but troubleÅ¿om and diÅ¿agreeable.</p>
                        <p>That which has given occaÅ¿ion to Å¿peak of Å¿uch Things as late <hi>Bergamots,</hi> is, That in Å¿ome very rainy Years, or from Å¿ome <hi>Soils</hi> more fat and moiÅ¿t, or in Å¿ome ExpoÅ¿ition leÅ¿s Sunny, or from Å¿ome Tree more Vigorous than ordinary, we commonly keep Å¿ome as long as till <hi>Lent,</hi> and thereupon we take pleaÅ¿ure to deceive our Å¿elves with the hopes of having the like every Year: But, the truth is, that commonly chance has more part in all this than any thing elÅ¿e; for the Å¿ame Tree which produces Å¿ome for the Month of <hi>October,</hi> yields Å¿ome others likewiÅ¿e Å¿ometimes for the Month of <hi>March,</hi> which happens chiefly when any particular Branch of it has bloÅ¿Å¿om'd much later than the reÅ¿t, the <hi>Pears</hi> which were the laÅ¿t in knitting, being commonly the laÅ¿t that ripen on that Tree; but that happens but very rarely: Or elÅ¿e we may Å¿ay very probably, That the <hi>Bergamots</hi> we have Å¿o in the latter SeaÅ¿ons, are of the growth of Å¿uch <hi>Standard-trees</hi> as are Grafted upon <hi>Free-Å¿tocks,</hi> and perhaps but little Å¿hone upon by the Sun; the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of Å¿uch Trees being ordinarily very dubious and uncertain, and particularly for the producing of <hi>Pears</hi> that are fair, agreeable to the Å¿ight, and good and backward. But howÅ¿oever Å¿ome Å¿uch are Å¿ometimes gathered, which keep a little longer than thoÅ¿e that grow on <hi>Wall-trees</hi> and <hi>Dwarfs:</hi> And therefore it were to purpoÅ¿e enough not for the Curious, of whom we treat here, that have but a very little Ground, but for thoÅ¿e that have a great deal, to venture to Plant Å¿ome of them in all manner of FaÅ¿hions; for, in fine, they ought not to fail to make what ProviÅ¿ion they can of <hi>Bergamot-pears.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides theÅ¿e aboveÅ¿aid Advantages of the good kind of <hi>Bergamot,</hi> it has yet another that methinks exalts it much above the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> in what concerns the preÅ¿ent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tation, which is, that the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> meets often at the Å¿ame time with the <hi>Peaches, Figs</hi> and <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Grapes</hi> of mid-<hi>September,</hi> three Å¿orts of good Fruits that all the World paÅ¿Å¿ionately affect, and in favour of which it may be Å¿aid, That among all Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Nice and Knowing PerÅ¿ons, they are Å¿o well received, that Å¿carcely any <hi>Pears</hi> dare venture into their Company; whereas the <hi>Bergamot</hi> ripens not till thoÅ¿e <hi>Peaches, Figs</hi> and <hi>MuÅ¿cats,</hi> nay, and the very <hi>Butter-pears</hi> and <hi>Verte-longues,</hi> or <hi>green-long-pears</hi> are ended, and Å¿o comes in all alone towards the end of <hi>October,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, in a time when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, we Å¿hould be reduced to a great Å¿carcity of good Fruits, the <hi>Pears</hi> call'd the <hi>LanÅ¿ac,</hi> the <hi>Å¿ugar-green,</hi> the <hi>Flowery-MuÅ¿cat, RouÅ¿Å¿eline, Bezi de la mote, Vine pear, MeÅ¿Å¿ire-John,</hi> &amp;c. not worthily enough Å¿upplying the place of thoÅ¿e laÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿ed; and therefore by conÅ¿equence, from hence they would pretend, That as to what concerns a little Garden, and that for the ReaÅ¿ons declared in the beginning of this Third Book, it is more convenient to Plant in it, for a Å¿econd <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> a <hi>Bergamot,</hi> than any other <hi>Pear-tree.</hi>

                        <p>The PartiÅ¿ans of the two preceding <hi>Pears,</hi> the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Bergamot,</hi> are methinks Å¿urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to hear Å¿ay there are any that dare to enter the LiÅ¿ts againÅ¿t them; and whatÅ¿oever the others can alledge they look upon as a piece of RaÅ¿hneÅ¿s, and therefore will hardly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afe to hear them; and if they conÅ¿ent to it, 'tis only to anÅ¿wer them in Terms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Raillery, or rather with deÅ¿ign to gain their cauÅ¿e againÅ¿t them with Å¿o much the more Glory and Security.</p>
                        <p>But for all that, the <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>VirgoulÃ©,</hi> which they call <hi>Bujaleuf</hi> in <hi>Angoumois, Chambretie</hi> in <hi>LimouÅ¿in</hi> or the Province of <hi>Limoges,</hi> the <hi>Ice-pear</hi> in <hi>GaÅ¿cony, VirgoleÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>VirgouleuÅ¿e</hi> in Å¿o many other Places, and which after the Example of the <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>BeÅ¿idery, L'EÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie,</hi> &amp;c. ought, in my Opinion, to bear the plain Name of <hi>Virgoule</hi> before any other; that which makes me judge Å¿o, is, becauÅ¿e we had it from a Village called <hi>VirgoulÃ©,</hi> near the Town of St. <hi>Leonard</hi> in the <hi>LimouÅ¿in</hi> Countty, where, in all appearance, it had paÅ¿Å¿ed a long time without any LuÅ¿tre, neither more nor leÅ¿s than juÅ¿t as a Pearl Å¿hut up in its Shell; but at laÅ¿t, as well for the HappineÅ¿s of our curious Gentlemen, as for the Ornament of our Gardens, it was advanced out of that Village by the Liberality of the MarqueÅ¿s of <hi>Chambret,</hi> who was Lord of it, and who was pleaÅ¿ed to give it us under the Name of his <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>VirgoulÃ©;</hi> Å¿ince which time it has begun to make it Å¿elf be talked on as Famous, Å¿o that at this Day, notwitÅ¿tanding the Brags, I Å¿ay, of the two preceding <hi>Pears,</hi> it, not without ReaÅ¿on enough, pretends to the Honour which is here propoÅ¿ed.</p>

It is a <hi>Pear</hi> of a Figure pretty long and thick, being three or four Inches long, and two or three in thickneÅ¿s; its Stalk is Å¿hort, fleÅ¿hy and bending; its Eye or Crown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently great and a little hollow; its Skin Å¿mooth and poliÅ¿h'd, and Å¿ometimes coloured, and which from green, which it was upon the Tree, grows yellow as it ripens, and in ripening grows tender and melting; Å¿o that when it is well nick'd in the gathering, it proves one of the beÅ¿t Fruits of the World: And accordingly its Reputation has made Å¿uch a ProgreÅ¿s, Å¿ince, that in a few Years time, it has Å¿pread it Å¿elf into as many Gardens all over <hi>Europe,</hi> as any Pear that we know.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Virgoulee-pear,</hi> priding it Å¿elf, as it may Å¿eem, as well in the Extraordinary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour that accompanies its Tree in all Places, and draws to it the Admiration of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, as alÅ¿o in the Merit it pretends to be ennobled with, and beÅ¿ides being offended at the injurious Contempt with which it was but now treated by the others, aÅ¿Å¿erts for the EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of its Right, That Nature has not only endowed it with all the good Qualities, namely, of a tender and melting Pulp, an Abundance of Å¿weet and Å¿ugred Juice, and a fine rich TaÅ¿te, and of a plentiful IncreaÅ¿e, which render the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Bergamot-pears</hi> Å¿o conÅ¿iderable; but that beÅ¿ides, that it has the aÅ¿Å¿ured Advantage to begin to ripen almoÅ¿t as Å¿oon as the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> and yet to laÅ¿t much longer than that; and in earneÅ¿t it alledges, That often from the very beginning of <hi>November,</hi> it is in a condition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Curious, which happens to thoÅ¿e of them that are raiÅ¿ed upon <hi>Wall-trees</hi> expoÅ¿ed to a good Sun, or that grow otherwiÅ¿e in a dry and light Soil, and that particularly it Å¿ignalizes it Å¿elf by furniÅ¿hing a great quantity of Fruit all the reÅ¿t of <hi>November,</hi> all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> and Å¿ometimes for part of <hi>January,</hi> which cannot be Å¿aid of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> and but little, or, at leaÅ¿t, very rarely, and by pure hazard, of the <hi>Bergamot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which induces the <hi>Virgoule-pear-tree</hi> to demand pretty boldly, whether it be not true, that its Fruit is not only Excellent for TaÅ¿te, but of an agreeable Figure to the Eye, Å¿o that thoÅ¿e <hi>Pears</hi> of it that grow in a fair ExpoÅ¿ition, acquire an admirable vermilion bluÅ¿h; this <hi>Pear-tree</hi> further demands, if it has not the gift to form the faireÅ¿t Trees of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruit-plants, and to Å¿ucceed admirably well in the Figure of a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, in that very manner of Trees, the Planting of which is at preÅ¿ent in QueÅ¿tion; it alÅ¿o further maintains, That the DiÅ¿tinctions of dry or moiÅ¿t Grounds, of <hi>Free</hi> or <hi>Quince-</hi>Å¿tocks, and of <hi>Standards</hi> or <hi>Wall-</hi>trees, are ordinarily of no Å¿uch great Importance to its Wood, as they are to that of the <hi>Bergamots;</hi> though in reÅ¿pect of the inward good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Fruit, thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of Differences work almoÅ¿t the Å¿ame Effects as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: It is then true, that the <hi>Virgoulees</hi> are not only not Å¿ubjected to that Å¿ort of ScabbineÅ¿s which disfigures the <hi>Bergamot-trees,</hi> and renders them hideous to look on, and too often kills them, or at leaÅ¿t hinders their FruitfulneÅ¿s; but on the contrary, Å¿hoot out regularly on all Å¿ides, Å¿tore of fair Branches, and are Å¿een always with a Å¿mooth and Å¿hining Complexion; as if really one had taken the care to rub them, to make them bright.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Virgoulee</hi> therefore pretends, That the time of its continuance in maturity, which is about Three Months, and the Beauty of its Tree, which never fails, ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail here to carry the CauÅ¿e for it, againÅ¿t both the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Bergamot-pear,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t all other <hi>Pears</hi> which would oppoÅ¿e it, Å¿ince, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e Advantges, it is Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none of the reÅ¿t, either for Abundance of IncreaÅ¿e, or in the Point of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s.</p>

is greeniÅ¿h and Å¿peckled, though the <hi>Ambret</hi> be commonly of a deeper and ruddier Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie</hi> lighter and yellower, but eÅ¿pecially when it grows ripe. TheÅ¿e two <hi>Pears</hi> further in Å¿ome degree reÅ¿emble one another in their Stalks, which in both of them are Å¿trait and pretty long, though that of the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie</hi> be a little thicker of the two; and in fine, they reÅ¿emble one another as well in the time of their ripening or mellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> and Å¿ometimes in <hi>January,</hi> as in the fine and butter-like Å¿ubÅ¿tance of their Pulp, and in their Å¿ugred and Å¿omewhat perfumed Juice, but that is perfumed with a Å¿cent Å¿o agreeable, that nothing can be wiÅ¿hed for more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: The <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie</hi> has a little more of it than its aÅ¿Å¿ociate, and the Pulp of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret</hi> is Å¿ometimes a little more greeniÅ¿h; its Kernels are blacker, and, as one may Å¿ay, lodged more at large in their Apartments, than the Kernels of the other, and even the Skin of it feels ordinarily a little rougher; and beÅ¿ides the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie pears</hi> are pretty often, as one may term them, bunch'd and warty; but as to the Wood of their Trees, they are very different one from the other, in that the Wood of the <hi>Ambret</hi> is extreamly thorny and prickly, and is exactly like one of thoÅ¿e wild Trees commonly Å¿een in Hedges and Thickets, which Quality is not to be found in that of the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie-tree,</hi> which is commonly pretty Å¿lender, and Å¿hoots forth Å¿ome Points but not Å¿harp enough to prick the Fingers of them that meddle with it, as do the <hi>Ambret-trees.</hi> TheÅ¿e two <hi>Pears</hi> found the Pretentions of their Claim of Preference upon the Fault that is found with the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> about the time of its ripening, and upon that objected againÅ¿t the <hi>Bergamot</hi> for its Scabby Wood; and laÅ¿tly upon that AccuÅ¿ation brought againÅ¿t the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> not only for being Å¿o long before it bears, but for having Å¿ome kind of diÅ¿agreeableneÅ¿s in its TaÅ¿te; Å¿o that having at leaÅ¿t all the good Qualities of thoÅ¿e <hi>Pears,</hi> both in their Fruit, and in the DiÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition of their Plants to be wrought into beautiful Figures of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> without participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any of their Defects, they pretend it their Right to be preferred before thoÅ¿e which are Å¿o notably incommoded with them, that they can neither avoid nor diÅ¿guiÅ¿e them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Winter Thorn pear,</hi> which well knows its own worth, will not let it Å¿elf be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned neither without Å¿peaking for it Å¿elf: It is a very fine <hi>Pear</hi> that approaches nearera Pyramidical than a round Figure, though it has almoÅ¿t no part that is Å¿mall in its Å¿hape, Å¿o that it ends in very little or nothing of a bluntiÅ¿h Point towards the Stalk, which Stalk is pretty Å¿hort and Å¿mall, except where it comes out of the <hi>Pear,</hi> where it is a little fleÅ¿hy; every where elÅ¿e the <hi>Pear</hi> is all over in a manner of the Å¿ame bigneÅ¿s, being about Two or Three Inches thick towards the Head; it is particularly much bigger than the ordinary <hi>Bergamot,</hi> or than the <hi>Ambret</hi> and <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie;</hi> it has a Å¿atiny Skin, and a Colour between Green and White; it Å¿ometimes Ripens before the two laÅ¿t preceding ones, but moÅ¿t commonly at the Å¿ame time with them, and Å¿ometimes too after them; it is likewiÅ¿e of a tender and butter-like ConÅ¿iÅ¿tence, having ordinarily a very fine and delicate Pulp, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable TaÅ¿te, and a Å¿weet Juice reliÅ¿hed with an admirable Å¿mack of Perfume; it alÅ¿o pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces fine <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and proÅ¿pers as well on <hi>Free</hi> as on <hi>Quince-tree-Å¿tocks,</hi> when the Stocks are good, and the Ground is well qualified, that is, of a dry rather than moiÅ¿t Temper. It has little to Å¿ay againÅ¿t the two laÅ¿t, and eÅ¿pecially againÅ¿t the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries,</hi> and ingenuouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿Å¿es the good Qualities of both of them, but yet without conÅ¿enting to give them the Precedence, till there Å¿hall be a Regulation for it; but as for the other <hi>Pears,</hi> it objects to them the Å¿ame Defects which theÅ¿e laÅ¿t juÅ¿t now Reproached them with.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore now the QueÅ¿tion how to terminate this ConteÅ¿tation which has appeared but too long, upon which, having maturely examined all the ReaÅ¿ons alledged by each of them, I confeÅ¿s I have a very particular eÅ¿teem for every one of them; but yet, in regard to the Trees which give them us, we muÅ¿t not judge the QueÅ¿tion here under DiÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion, altogether upon the Å¿ame Foundation as if we were only examining the Merit of each Fruit in particular, and by comparing them only one with the other; for upon the bare Foot of Merit, in what Garden Å¿oever it were, where there were to be but two <hi>Dwarf pear-trees,</hi> I Å¿hould ever incline to give the Å¿econd place to the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> which I honour infinitely, and that, methinks, cannot be too much honoured, as being as it were the Queen of <hi>Pears:</hi> For indeed it is like the Excellent <hi>Muskmelons,</hi> its Pulp appearing at firÅ¿t firm, without being hard or Å¿tony, and fine and melting without being Doughy or Mealy, and its Juice Å¿ugred and a little Perfumed without having any mixture of Å¿harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s or wildneÅ¿s; and laÅ¿tly, its TaÅ¿te rich, and wonderfully delicious, and accompanied with Å¿omething of Noble: For Å¿uch a <hi>Pear</hi> as that, may it not vaunt to have approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very near the Perfection of Fruits, and ought it not to Å¿erve for a Rule and Model to all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall pretend to be entred into the Catalogue of good Fruits?</p>

                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48210:70"/>
This DeciÅ¿ion, in favour of the <hi>Bergamot</hi> to the ExcluÅ¿ion of the other <hi>Pears,</hi> would not at all Å¿urprize thoÅ¿e curious PerÅ¿ons that have taÅ¿ted thoÅ¿e that are really good; for aÅ¿Å¿uredly it excels the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> which cannot deny but it has a little mixture of Å¿harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s in its Juice; it Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿es the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> in that it is a nimbler-bearing Tree than that, and is not at all Å¿ubject to that little odd Å¿trawy TaÅ¿te, which, as I may Å¿o Å¿ay, perÅ¿ecutes the moÅ¿t part of the <hi>Virgoulee pears,</hi> and does them a ThouÅ¿and ill Offices in good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; it no leÅ¿s Å¿urmounts the other three Competitors, the <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie,</hi> the <hi>Ambret</hi> and the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> becauÅ¿e that certainly they have nothing in them more Excellent nor more Advantageous than our <hi>Bergamot</hi> in the point of perfect goodneÅ¿s, but, as one may Å¿ay, without any deÅ¿ign to offend them, that both the one and the other have Å¿ometimes the ill hap to have a faint and inÅ¿ipid Juice, and a hard or meally Pulp: But theÅ¿e Faults are not to be objected againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e kinds of Fruits in general, but are rather Defects that proceed from the ColdneÅ¿s or MoiÅ¿tneÅ¿s of the Year, the badneÅ¿s of the Soil, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ExpoÅ¿ition in which they were produced.</p>
                        <p>Yet that which may Å¿ometimes hinder the <hi>Bergamot</hi> from receiving the benefit of this my Declaration, is, the unhappineÅ¿s the Wood of its Tree has to be of Å¿o delicate a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that inÅ¿tead of making an agreeable Spectacle in Gardens, it does often but vex its Owner with its ScabbineÅ¿s, which is an evil that every where almoÅ¿t perÅ¿ecutes both its Fruit and Tree. And that is the ReaÅ¿on I do not willingly venture to CounÅ¿el the Planting any of them any where in the Figure of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and much leÅ¿s in little Gardens: But yet, if notwithÅ¿tanding this Deformity, which Å¿o much diÅ¿obliges the Eyes, any PerÅ¿ons be minded, becauÅ¿e of the Excellence of its Fruit, to Plant any of them in all Å¿orts of Gardens, whether great or Å¿mall, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing always the Ground to be fitly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I would have thoÅ¿e choÅ¿en that are graffed upon <hi>Free-Å¿tocks;</hi> but if the Ground be fatty and a little moiÅ¿t, then I would adviÅ¿e them to take thoÅ¿e that are Graffed on <hi>Quince-Å¿tocks,</hi> and further, I would wiÅ¿h them to take the <hi>Striped Bergamot,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e called the <hi>SuiÅ¿Å¿e Bergamot,</hi> rather than the common one, becauÅ¿e being both of an equal goodneÅ¿s, and as difficult to Rear the one as the other, it Å¿eems in my Judgment more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, to fix firÅ¿t upon the <hi>Striped</hi> one before we Plant any of the other Å¿ort, becauÅ¿e it has the advantage to Å¿urpaÅ¿s this latter in Beauty of Colours; but, in fine, if none be Planted of either of them in the form of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> we Å¿hould not fail however to Plant a great many <hi>Wall-trees</hi> of them in great Gardens; and I would have one <hi>Standard tree</hi> of them Planted, to make a Figure in a great Å¿pace which without that, would appear too much UngarniÅ¿h'd. But above all, it is moÅ¿t advantageous to Plant one of them in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of a great Wall expoÅ¿ed to a good Sun; for I have had very great Satisfaction in doing in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>VerÅ¿ailles</hi> what I now CounÅ¿el to others: I alÅ¿o Plant Å¿ome of them of the Å¿ize of half <hi>Standards,</hi> as well in the middle of Squares, as on the Å¿ides, and particularly I plant Å¿ome of them at two or three foot diÅ¿tance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in NurÅ¿ery-Gardens; and I take the Å¿ame way with all the other delicate Å¿orts, as the <hi>Petit-oins,</hi> the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonne</hi> or <hi>good LouiÅ¿e,</hi> the <hi>Sugar-green,</hi> &amp;c. to which a cold and moiÅ¿t Earth is abÅ¿olutely contrary, and I gather from them for Eight or Ten Years, a conÅ¿iderable quantity of very good Fruits, and when thoÅ¿e Trees grow too big and Å¿eem to encumber the place where they are, I take them away, and plant young Ones elÅ¿ewhere, to have the Å¿ame AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance from them as long as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                        <p>The Article concerning this <hi>Bergamot-pear,</hi> has given a great deal of trouble to decide it; I return now at laÅ¿t to declare my Judgment of thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees which, together with the Beauty of their Fruit, have the Advantage to be graced with a beautiful Wood: <note place="margin">The Å¿econd place adjudged to a <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree,</hi> wherein the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> is to be prefered to the <hi>Virgoulee.</hi>

And for its ConÅ¿olation, it may expect its turn will come very quickly to be treated elÅ¿ewhere much better than the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> that is, much more multiplied in Trees of its Kind; for in this reÅ¿pect, it will in a very high degree Å¿urpaÅ¿s the other in moÅ¿t great Gardens, which we Å¿hall afterwards Plant.</p>

We cannot deny but there have been many of theÅ¿e <hi>Pears</hi> found with that Defect; but then 'tis not impoÅ¿Å¿ible to exempt them from it; for it proceeds from their having been too long kept upon Hay or Straw, or perhaps too long Å¿mothered up in Å¿ome Cupboard, where they had no Air, or in a kind of Cellar, which is never without Å¿ome TaÅ¿te of MuÅ¿t; or elÅ¿e in Å¿ome Fruit-Å¿tore-houÅ¿e too cloÅ¿e kept Å¿hut, when full of other Å¿orts of Fruits, and perhaps in Å¿ome part of it Infected with Å¿ome Å¿trong Smell whatever it be: For all thoÅ¿e Scents together make but a very diÅ¿agreeable Smell, of which this kind of <hi>Pear</hi> is unhappily very Å¿uÅ¿ceptible. The only Remedy in QueÅ¿tion is then, to put them up in Å¿ome place where none of theÅ¿e Inconveniences are to be met with, and conÅ¿equently having a Fruit-loft for that purpoÅ¿e, well Qualified againÅ¿t the great Cold and MoiÅ¿ture, the Boards of it muÅ¿t be covered with Å¿ome MoÅ¿s extreamly well dried; and then the <hi>Pears</hi> muÅ¿t be placed on it at a diÅ¿tance one from the other, and Air muÅ¿t be given them as often as the Weather is fair: With theÅ¿e kinds of Precautions, which are not very difficult, we may be aÅ¿Å¿ured to have all Winter long theÅ¿e <hi>Virgoulee-pears</hi> preÅ¿erved from any ill TaÅ¿te.

                              </note> withered; and Å¿econdly, that they be yellow almoÅ¿t all over the whole Extent of their Skin; and thirdly, if in Å¿queezing them a little with the Thumb near the Stalk, they give way without Å¿hewing any Å¿oftneÅ¿s at the Heart; that is to Å¿ay, in fine, if they come Å¿o well to ripen and mellow, that their Pulp is become tender and melting: For if, though in appearance ripe, they remain firm and hard, as it happens Å¿ometimes to them that have been laid up in moiÅ¿t Places, or which are of the Product of a very Rainy Summer, or of Å¿ome <hi>Northern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ition, or Å¿ome cold and watriÅ¿h Soil, then it cannot be denied but that theÅ¿e Å¿ort of <hi>Pears</hi> prove both mealy and inÅ¿ipid, and by conÅ¿equence diÅ¿agreeable. So it is, that among the Things of this World, that are the moÅ¿t perfect, there may be Å¿ome of them that may fall into Corruption, and at the Å¿ame time into Contempt; but the Fault of one particular thing ought not to be made a matter of Reproach to the whole general Kind.</p>
                           <p>One thing that is extraordinary enough, I have to remark concerning theÅ¿e <hi>Pears,</hi> is, <note place="margin">A Å¿ingular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark about <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulee-pears.</hi>
                              </note> That Å¿uch of them as perhaps fell off the Tree, or were gathered about Fifteen Days before they Å¿hould have been, and which becauÅ¿e of that grow a little withered (for if they were much Å¿o, they would be deÅ¿piÅ¿able in all manner of ReÅ¿pects) theÅ¿e Å¿ort of <hi>Pears,</hi> I Å¿ay, though a little unhandÅ¿om to look upon, yet at length being throughly mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, are almoÅ¿t always of an admirable TaÅ¿te, which can be hardly Å¿aid of any other Fruit: But yet I do not CounÅ¿el any to gather them very long before their time; as for Example, before the End of <hi>September,</hi> becauÅ¿e the ordinary Winds that Reign at that time, Å¿pare them, and Å¿ometimes more than they deÅ¿ire, the taking of that Pains; and therefore we may comfort our Å¿elves then, when any of them happen to fall, with the Expectation that they will mellow later than the reÅ¿t, and will be leÅ¿s Å¿ubject to grow doughy, and we Å¿hall be apt to wiÅ¿h it may happen oftner, that we may without fail have Å¿ome <hi>Pears</hi> that may be good, and at the Å¿ame time fair, Å¿ound and indifferently wrinkled.

I cannot but confeÅ¿s likewiÅ¿e, That it is very hard to find any perfect ones of them; Å¿o that one may Å¿ay of them, and of the <hi>Petit-oins, Ambrets, LouiÅ¿e-bonnes</hi> and <hi>Colmars, &amp;c.</hi> what is Å¿aid of new laid Eggs, That the leaÅ¿t Defect is enough to make them be rejected: Whereas it is not Å¿o with other <hi>Pears,</hi> they are not rejected, though they want Å¿ome degree of natural Perfection, for all <hi>Butter pears, RuÅ¿Å¿elets, Boncretiens, &amp;c.</hi> are not every <hi>Pear</hi> of them of the moÅ¿t Excellent in their Kind, and yet that hinders not People from eating them, though but of a midling GoodneÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>There truly Å¿till remains a Å¿mall Reproach to be made to this <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> becauÅ¿e it ripens Å¿ometimes at the Å¿ame time with the other <hi>Pears</hi> which I have newly placed before it, and conÅ¿equently according to thoÅ¿e Regards I always have in making this Choice, and from which it will be convenient I Å¿hould never depart, it would be much better to Plant Å¿ome good Fruit of another SeaÅ¿on in this little Garden, rather than this <hi>Pear;</hi> but to this I anÅ¿wer, That Å¿ince this objected Inconvenience of over-haÅ¿ty ripening, happens but very Å¿eldom, inÅ¿tead of baniÅ¿hing the <hi>Thorn-pear</hi> from hence for Å¿uch a Reproach as that, we ought rather to be careful to plant it there, and eÅ¿pecially if there be already no <hi>Bergamot</hi> Dwarf-tree, becauÅ¿e it makes a very agreeable Dwarf-tree, and eaÅ¿ily takes to bear.</p>

It requires to be graffed upon a Free-Å¿tock in dry Grounds, and upon a <hi>Quince</hi> one in thoÅ¿e which are moiÅ¿tiÅ¿h. It Å¿ucceeds not Å¿o well in the form of a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> as in that of a <hi>Standard,</hi> in thoÅ¿e Grounds that are a little Å¿trong; and commonly is worth nothing in Soils that are fat and moiÅ¿t, having that Quality in common with Å¿ome others which I Å¿hall Å¿peak of afterwards. However, I muÅ¿t needs Å¿ay, that, with the care I have had to keep my Soil a little raiÅ¿ed, and timely to uncover my <hi>Thorn-pears</hi> by Å¿trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the Leaves of their <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> I have had very fair and good ones of them for near two Months together; and conÅ¿equently, that the Defects of this <hi>Pear</hi> are not always incorrigible, and that when we can preÅ¿erve it from them, It is a piece of InjuÅ¿tice not to give it place before the two laÅ¿t preceding ones.</p>
                           <p>I prefer it here before the St. <hi>Germain,</hi> the <hi>Perit-oin,</hi> the <hi>CraÅ¿anne,</hi> the <hi>MarchioneÅ¿s,</hi> the <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonne,</hi> the <hi>Colmar,</hi> and the St. <hi>AuguÅ¿tin-pears;</hi> becauÅ¿e, that all things well conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is of more worth than they; and chiefly, becauÅ¿e the moÅ¿t part of thoÅ¿e other <hi>Pears</hi> mellow in the time of Å¿ome of the three preceding ones, that is to Å¿ay, in the Months of <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December;</hi> in which, with reÅ¿pect to the Å¿mallneÅ¿s of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens we now treat of, we have other Fruits enough to give content.</p>
                           <p>I prefer it alÅ¿o before the two moÅ¿t valuable <hi>Summer-pears,</hi> which are the Famous <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet,</hi> and the IlluÅ¿trious <hi>Robine,</hi> but it is but one degree only to make it march imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before them; and theÅ¿e latter in their turn Å¿hall be preferred before thoÅ¿e other five, which are of Å¿o great Reputation. And without doubt, this preference given them without any heÅ¿itation, ought to Å¿top their Mouths from murmuring, becauÅ¿e they were no Å¿ooner produced on the Stage. For my part, I make Å¿o great account of both of them, that I do not think a Garden that may contain Seven or Eight <hi>Dwarf-pear-trees,</hi> ought to be without one <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet</hi> and one <hi>Robine-tree;</hi> which when we have placed, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine what good and conÅ¿iderable Qualities the other <hi>Pears</hi> can plead, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the doing them that Å¿peedy JuÅ¿tice thereupon, which we think to be their Due.</p>
                           <p>Would to God, that in the matter of good Pears, the Months of <hi>January, February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> were able to furniÅ¿h me as many Å¿ubjects of DiÅ¿putes and ConteÅ¿tation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as I am plied with by the four preceding Months; for theÅ¿e latter being Å¿o poor and barren as they are, have great need of aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance; but when there will come any to them, I cannot tell. Certain it is, 'twould be a great good Fortune to them, if they poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed any of thoÅ¿e good Pears, which pour in in Shoals upon us, as I may Å¿ay, about the End of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Winter;</hi> I loÅ¿e not a moment of Time in Å¿tudying and uÅ¿ing all imaginable means, as I have before Å¿aid, to bring about Å¿o great a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>But to return to my purpoÅ¿e, I proceed then to place theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t Pears, of which we were but now Å¿peaking, aÅ¿Å¿uredly expecting, that my Choice of them will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. For, methinks, we ought not to delay any longer to introduce here Å¿ome <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-pears,</hi> having already placed Å¿ix Sorts of other SeaÅ¿ons: But what muÅ¿t I do to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the DiÅ¿pute that's like to riÅ¿e between theÅ¿e two Pears, which Å¿hall be the firÅ¿t? Why, I will not undertake to decide it of my own Head, it being a CauÅ¿e too dangerous to judge of in the preÅ¿ence of the Patrons of both the Parties, and therefore not to embroil my Å¿elf on either Å¿ide. The way I Å¿hall take with them, Å¿hall be either to give theÅ¿e Pears an alternative Precedence to be enjoyed by each of them, in their turns, or rather even to let them fairly draw Lots for it: 'Tis not the firÅ¿t ConteÅ¿t of Precedence that has
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48210:72"/>
been determined this way and that, to the Contentment of both Parties too. So be it then, and accordingly they caÅ¿t Lots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>

                           <p>It is good you Å¿hould know here, That nothing is more contrary to this <hi>Pear,</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being Excellent, than the planting it againÅ¿t a Wall, becauÅ¿e it certainly loÅ¿es in that Situation, a part of its Perfume; but it grows fair there indeed and large, and in great abundance, and by that, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, Repairs the Defect of extream GoodneÅ¿s: So that we may lay it down for a Rule, That we ought to Plant few Trees of this Fruit againÅ¿t Walls, unleÅ¿s we make more account of the bigneÅ¿s and quantity of its Fruit, than of the goodneÅ¿s and Delicacy of its TaÅ¿te; or, unleÅ¿s we think it better rather to have Å¿ome of them, though but indifferently good, than to have none at all, that being the ordinary Effect of a <hi>Wall-tree</hi> in reÅ¿pect of <hi>Pears</hi> and <hi>Peaches;</hi> for that is of the two, what I would counÅ¿el all PerÅ¿ons to chuÅ¿e, who have a great deal of Walling to garniÅ¿h, as I Å¿hall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more particularly Å¿hew, this not being the place to Å¿peak of it here. I was not able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the Temptation which over-Å¿way'd me, nor to forget any thing that might Å¿et out the Excellence of this <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet;</hi> and therefore cannot but obÅ¿erve to you, that there is Å¿till one Å¿ingular Advantage belonging to it, which is, that whereas moÅ¿t other Fruits prove unÅ¿ucceÅ¿sful upon the <hi>Northern Wall-trees,</hi> yet thoÅ¿e of this <hi>Pear</hi> in that ExpoÅ¿ition, produce Fruit reaÅ¿onably good, Å¿o that it would not be amiÅ¿s to plant Å¿ome Trees of it in thoÅ¿e Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions which commonly are uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, or very bad for other Fruit.</p>

come in the firÅ¿t <hi>Summer-</hi>Months, and Å¿ome again yet leÅ¿s to the purpoÅ¿e, in the midÅ¿t of <hi>Winter;</hi> Å¿o that this <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet,</hi> inÅ¿tead of ripening as it does, at the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> and beginning of <hi>September,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, in the time of the abundance of good <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Plums,</hi> had but the Gift to come and feaÅ¿t us, either Å¿ome time before the Maturity of the principal Stone-fruits, or Å¿ometimes after they are paÅ¿t. I could not help making this wiÅ¿h, though it be Å¿o very inÅ¿ignificant, and beg your Pardon for it. I know well enough, That <hi>Peaches,</hi> when they attain their natural GoodneÅ¿s are, as one may Å¿ay, the precious <hi>Manna</hi> of our Gardens, and by the general ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of all, are more valuable than any Kernel-fruit whatÅ¿oever; Å¿o that few People make their Court to theÅ¿e laÅ¿t, Å¿o long as the <hi>Peaches</hi> with their largeneÅ¿s, fine Å¿hape, beautiful Colour, and the abundance of their Å¿weet and rich taÅ¿ted Juice, together with all the reÅ¿t of their admirable Qualities, continue in a condition to charm the Eye, and move the Appetite.</p>
                           <p>But yet for all that, the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets</hi> and the <hi>Robines</hi> are eÅ¿teemed even in the SeaÅ¿on of <hi>Peaches,</hi> how plentiful Å¿oever theÅ¿e latter be: And likewiÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e <hi>Peaches</hi> are commonly more faulty, and more apt to fall Å¿hort of their due Perfection than <hi>Pears,</hi> and that <hi>Peaches</hi> of the growth of a moiÅ¿t Soil, are good for little, therefore 'tis neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them, whoÅ¿e Ground is not very good, to precaution and provide themÅ¿elves another way, at leaÅ¿t by a Å¿upply of <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet-pears</hi> in their Å¿tead, which Å¿eldom fails and is never to be rejected; that at the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> which is the SeaÅ¿on of Mens eager Appetite, and moÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿ionate deÅ¿ire after Fruits, they may be furniÅ¿h'd at leaÅ¿t with Å¿ome pretty good <hi>Pears,</hi> in caÅ¿e they be Å¿o unhappy as to Å¿ee the moÅ¿t part of their <hi>Peaches</hi> miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, or prove not over good.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Pear</hi> is indeed Å¿mall, but it affords this convenience, that it may be gathered while 'tis yet greeniÅ¿h, to mellow afterwards off of the Tree; Å¿o that by that means it may be kept Å¿ome Days, whilÅ¿t the perfection of its mellowneÅ¿s is coming on, and may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diminution of its goodneÅ¿s, be hazarded to make Å¿ome Å¿mall Journies; Å¿o that, for Example, one may carry Å¿ome about one, or Å¿end them from Province to Province, when the diÅ¿tance is not too great.</p>
                           <p>And now, after all theÅ¿e PraiÅ¿es I have given to the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet,</hi> may it not Å¿eem to have Å¿ome ReaÅ¿on to complain of me, for giving it but a Seventh place? I certainly have for it as much ConÅ¿ideration as any curious PerÅ¿on can have; but, in fine, that which ought to juÅ¿tifie my Conduct in this CaÅ¿e, is, That when one can compaÅ¿s Å¿o much as to have a Garden big enough to contain Five or Six <hi>Dwarf-pear-trees,</hi> one may and ought, in all probability, to have a proportionable quantity of <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> for <hi>Figs, Peaches, Plums</hi> and <hi>Grapes.</hi> And that Å¿o it would be a piece of Imprudence, for Å¿uch very little Places as are the Gardens we are here planting, to CounÅ¿el any one to plant any conÅ¿iderable number of Trees, both of Stone-fruit and Kernel-fruit, to ripen in one and the Å¿ame SeaÅ¿on of the Months of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> which could not well be without running the hazard of having almoÅ¿t no Fruit at all for the moÅ¿t difficult SeaÅ¿ons: And therefore I have ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Expectations upon the <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> to be Å¿urely furniÅ¿hed with <hi>Summer-Fruits,</hi> and have deÅ¿ign'd the moÅ¿t part of the Å¿ix firÅ¿t <hi>Pear-trees</hi> for the making a ProviÅ¿ion for <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> two SeaÅ¿ons which we paÅ¿s but diÅ¿agreeably without a DeÅ¿ert to brisk them up; And therefore, I think, I have great ReaÅ¿on to Å¿ay, we ought to labour to provide for them before the reÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet</hi> being thus plac'd, the <hi>Robine</hi> advances, and takes the Eighth place.</p>

                           <p>And that which is here to be Remarked by all the world (for ordinarily men are not MaÅ¿ters of Å¿uch happy Soils) is, That of theÅ¿e Å¿even Å¿orts of <hi>Pears,</hi> there are two that are much afraid of a very dry ground, and require one that is moderately MoiÅ¿t, and they are the <hi>CraÅ¿ane,</hi> and the St. <hi>Germain;</hi> but that, as for the other five Å¿orts, they are of a quite oppoÅ¿ite Temper, and Å¿ucceed wonderfully well, where the two others miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; and again in their turn, become Objects of our pity, or rather of our Horrour and AverÅ¿ion, in moiÅ¿t Soils, unleÅ¿s our induÅ¿try and cultivation be very skillfully applied to correct that defect.</p>
                           <p>You may be pleaÅ¿ed to take Notice, what for that purpoÅ¿e I have practiÅ¿ed with good <note place="margin">Directions how to accommodate our ground to all Å¿orts of Trees.</note> Å¿ucceÅ¿s enough in the Kings <hi>Kitchin-Garden;</hi> The Scituation of the place which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally MarÅ¿hy, and the Temper of the Earth which is cold and groÅ¿s, put me on upon making many Experiments, as I have Å¿aid elÅ¿ewhere; for I was abÅ¿olutely minded to have of all thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Pears,</hi> that really had any thing of worth to make them deÅ¿ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for that effect, Å¿triving particularly to content the palate of the <hi>MaÅ¿ter</hi> I have the honour to Å¿erve, I endeavoured to lay in there a proportion of Molds of all Å¿orts of ConÅ¿titutions, to give thoÅ¿e <hi>Pears</hi> the means to attain their due perfection: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I raiÅ¿ed a part of my ground into double Slopes and Ridges with convenient Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Gutters between, to drain them, and conÅ¿equently to dry them from all Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous MoiÅ¿ture; and planted upon the moÅ¿t Elevated parts of theÅ¿e Ridges or Slopes, as well in form of <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Standard-trees,</hi> Å¿uch Å¿orts of Fruits that could the leaÅ¿t endure humidity, and placed thoÅ¿e others that find their Account better in a Scituation not Å¿o dry, in other parts which I had not raiÅ¿ed Å¿o high.</p>
                           <p>The CounÅ¿el then that I take the Liberty to give to all curious perÅ¿ons, is, that, if their little Gardens offend in humidity, and they be minded to correct that Fault in them, they would imitate as far as they can in due proportion, what I have practiÅ¿ed in a very great one; and on the other Å¿ide, that they who have only a very dry Soil, if they pleaÅ¿e to believe me, would plant but few <hi>CraÅ¿ane,</hi> or St. <hi>Germain-Pear-trees,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be upon

                           <p>But thoÅ¿e again who have ground that is moderately MoiÅ¿t, will do well to give Å¿ome good places to Å¿ome <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of the <hi>CraÅ¿ane</hi> and St. <hi>Germain-Pears</hi> grafted, either upon free or <hi>Quince-Å¿tocks,</hi> and at the Å¿ame time, to reject the <hi>LouiÅ¿e-Bonns,</hi> or <hi>Good-LouiÅ¿e,</hi> the <hi>Petit-Oins,</hi> and the <hi>MarchioneÅ¿s-pears,</hi> unleÅ¿s they plant Standard Trees of them, or take great care that nothing cover them from the heat of the Sun.</p>
                           <p>The Å¿hort Eating <hi>Pears,</hi> which were formerly in Å¿uch great Vogue in all Gardens, are Å¿o far from Å¿eeing themÅ¿elves in favour at this day, that now no eÅ¿teem at all is made neither of the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire Johns,</hi> nor <hi>Dry-Martins,</hi> nor <hi>Portals,</hi> nor <hi>BeÅ¿ideries,</hi> and if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon Noble Tables, it is not never to return any more, or to give any pleaÅ¿ure to the TaÅ¿te; but only with deÅ¿ign at moÅ¿t, to help towards a Å¿olid conÅ¿truction of <hi>Fruit-Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> there uÅ¿ed for <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Shew.</hi> Yet notwithÅ¿tanding all this, theÅ¿e kinds of <hi>Pears</hi> are not without Å¿ome Patrons; and therefore as they are Å¿enÅ¿ible they have Å¿till as much worth as ever they had formerly, they demand to be admitted to have the fair play to Å¿hew it with the beÅ¿t advantage to the world; to endeavour what they can to retrive their credit, and to be Å¿uffered at leaÅ¿t to follow next thoÅ¿e fifteen choice preceding <hi>Pears</hi> which have had all the honour of the FirÅ¿t Gardens.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>Great Blanquet,</hi> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> is very different from that which is Å¿imply called the <hi>Blanquet,</hi> or <hi>little Blanquet-pear,</hi> and is more forward in ripening by Fifteen Days; it is bigger and not Å¿o handÅ¿omly Å¿haped for a <hi>Pear</hi> as the leÅ¿Å¿er one; it colours a little upon a <hi>Dwarf tree,</hi> and has a very Å¿hort thick Å¿tack and a little hollow Å¿et: Its Wood, which is Å¿mall, and its Leaf, are pretty like thoÅ¿e of the <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-thigh,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Wood of the <hi>Little Blanquet</hi> is ordinarily very thick and pretty Å¿hort; the <hi>Great Blanquet</hi> is likewiÅ¿e very different from the <hi>Long-tail'd Blanquet,</hi> which is a handÅ¿om <hi>Pear,</hi> whoÅ¿e Crown is pretty big and Å¿tanding out; its belly round and pretty long towards the Å¿talk, which is a little fleÅ¿hy and pretty long, and bending downwards; its Skin very Å¿mooth, white, and Å¿ometimes a little coloured on the Sunny Å¿ide; its Pulp is between Å¿hort and tender, very fine, and very full of Juice, which is Å¿urged and very pleaÅ¿ant. It has the faults of moÅ¿t part of the <hi>Summer-pears,</hi> which are to have Å¿omething of Å¿tony or earthy Relicks, and to become doughy when they are let to grow too ripe; this <hi>Pear,</hi> no more than the <hi>Great Blanquet</hi> are not yet very common, though they well deÅ¿erve to be Å¿o: They Å¿ucceed well, whether it be on <hi>Dwarf</hi> or <hi>Standard trees.</hi> I Å¿hall not be long before I place this <hi>Long-tail'd Blanquet.</hi> The white Colour which appears in the Skin of the three Å¿orts of <hi>Pears,</hi> has occaÅ¿ioned their being called <hi>Blanquets</hi> or <hi>Blanched pears,</hi> which is the Name they bear.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿olet</hi> having juÅ¿t now Å¿een the <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madam,</hi> and the <hi>Great Blanquet,</hi> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> paÅ¿s before it, murmurs in earneÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it is not preferr'd before them. It is a longiÅ¿h and greyiÅ¿h <hi>Pear,</hi> which is hardly inferior to any thing to the <hi>Robine-pear;</hi> neither in its Pulp, nor in its Juice, nor in its whole Excellence taken altogether, Å¿ave only that is apt to grow Å¿oft, which happens not to the <hi>Robine-pear,</hi> and therefore it might well diÅ¿pute theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t places, if it were as happy as the <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-thighs,</hi> and <hi>Blanquets</hi> or <hi>White Musked-pears,</hi> in well timing its Maturity; but it comes not in till about the middle of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, with the <hi>Robine,</hi> and near about the beginning of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Peaches,</hi> and in the prime of the SeaÅ¿on of <hi>Figs,</hi> and of the beÅ¿t <hi>Plums,</hi> which we have by the means of Walls of IncloÅ¿ure, which is, to come in too good company to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Å¿o Å¿oon in the firÅ¿t honours of Å¿mall Gardens, and therefore I defer the placing of it yet for Å¿ome further time.</p>
                           <p>It is viÅ¿ible enough, that in this diÅ¿tribution of Places, I act as 'twere the part of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> who for the common good, aims particularly to order things Å¿o, that if in every Å¿eaÅ¿on of the year we cannot have an abundance of good fruits, we may have at leaÅ¿t a competent and reaÅ¿onable quantity of them in proportion to the extent and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Ground in the Garden every one has, and particularly in proportion to the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance which the Wall-trees Å¿hould contribute for their part, upon which I count, and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that had it not been for Å¿uch proÅ¿pects as theÅ¿e, I had already placed the <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿olet,</hi> and the <hi>Musked Summer Boncretien, &amp;c.</hi> That which I intend then at preÅ¿ent, is Å¿o exactly well to regulate and proportion all good fruits that every one of them in its rank, may have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Å¿atisfie the obligation that Å¿eems to have been impoÅ¿ed upon them all, not only to give pleaÅ¿ure to man, but above all, to contribute to the preÅ¿ervation of his health.</p>
                           <p>And methinks we have appearance enough to perÅ¿wade us, there is Å¿uch an obligation laid on them: For in effect, is it not viÅ¿ible, in that Nature furniÅ¿hes us more or leÅ¿s of fruits according as we are more or leÅ¿s attacked by external heat, which would otherwiÅ¿e be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to offend us? This is a Sovereign Remedy, and a RefreÅ¿hment ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which Å¿he preÅ¿ents us every year in the Critical time of our need: 'Tis for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, that in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, in the time of the moÅ¿t formidable heats of the <hi>Dog-days,</hi> we have Å¿uch Å¿tore of <hi>Musk-melons, Figs, Peaches, Plums,</hi> and even of <hi>Pears</hi> too:</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48210:77"/>
We Å¿ee likewiÅ¿e that at the arrival of the rigorous cold, which ordinarily domineers from <hi>Mid-November,</hi> till <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> we all finding our Å¿elves more Å¿enÅ¿ible of the firÅ¿t on-Å¿et of the FroÅ¿ts, are thereby conÅ¿trained to approach Å¿o much the nearer the Fire, to defend our Å¿elves from them.</p>
                           <p>That external foreign heat Å¿o Å¿uddenly taken in, might without doubt Å¿o immoderately augment that which we have from Nature, that great Infirmities might from thence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us. But that this good Mother out of her ordinary WiÅ¿dom Å¿eems to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againÅ¿t them, by giving us preciÅ¿ely for that time, an admirable Quantity of tender Fruits, that is to Å¿ay, of <hi>Bergamot-pears, Petit-oins, CraÅ¿annes, LouiÅ¿e-bonnes</hi> or <hi>Good-LouiÅ¿es, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries, Ambrets, Virgoulees, Thorn-pears, St. Germains, Colmars, St. AuguÅ¿tins,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing with them even Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e Å¿hort-eating and musked <hi>Pears,</hi> which are no bad Fruit, of which I have above Å¿poken, as <hi>Amadots, Great Musk-pears, Dry Martins</hi> and <hi>Portals,</hi> beÅ¿ides all the <hi>Apples,</hi> as <hi>Calvilles, Pepins, Fenouillets</hi> or <hi>Fennel-apples, Cour-pendu's</hi> or <hi>Short-Å¿talk'd Apples, &amp;c.</hi> And we Å¿ee the number of theÅ¿e divine Antidotes diminiÅ¿hes gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as we ceaÅ¿e to have Å¿o great a neceÅ¿Å¿ity for them; that is, I mean as the great Cold approaches, which, if I may be Å¿o bold to Å¿ay it, appears to me, to be the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankind, and which particularly at the time that I am labouring moÅ¿t for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I treat of, moÅ¿t Torments and Afflicts me.</p>
                           <p>'Tis not my part, nor yet is this a proper place to declaim here againÅ¿t this Cold; but if any advantage might redound to us by Å¿o doing, without doubt conÅ¿idering that it equally incommodes me every where, where-ever I meet with it, whether in my Body or my Å¿lender wit, or whether more particularly in our Gardens, and, above all, in regard of our Novelties. There Å¿hould be nothing that I would not Å¿ay or do, to baniÅ¿h a good part of it out of our Climates: For, humanly Å¿peaking, I have no kindneÅ¿s at all for the Cold, unleÅ¿s it be for Å¿ome Icicles and a little Snow, which are the Relicks we have of it in its abÅ¿ence, and which we take great care to Å¿hut up in the cloÅ¿e PriÅ¿ons of our Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houÅ¿es; they being as it Å¿eems a Å¿ort of Criminals which have need of the Correction of a long ImpriÅ¿onment, before they can be brought to a temper to be made Å¿erviceable for any good; And, in effect, there is a time when the Remains of thoÅ¿e PerÅ¿ecutors of Men and Gardens, approve themÅ¿elves to be very uÅ¿eful; for, in fine, during the troubleÅ¿om heats of <hi>Summer,</hi> they bear the moÅ¿t delicious part in the Drink of Noble PerÅ¿ons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, would to God, that without experimenting the Rigor of the <hi>Winters</hi> our Å¿elves, we could have Ice brought to us from the <hi>North,</hi> as we have <hi>Olives, Oranges,</hi> and Å¿o many other good Things from hot Countries.</p>
                           <p>I proceed all along according to the DeÅ¿ign I propoÅ¿ed to my Å¿elf, which is to contrive, as near as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible, that we may have in every Garden at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome one kind of good Fruit of every SeaÅ¿on, and that from the Moment we begin to have any, there may be no diÅ¿continuation or interval till the return of Fruits again the next Year. We have the <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-thigh,</hi> about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> we may join to it for the One and Twentieth place, the <hi>Musked Bourdon,</hi> or rather the <hi>MuÅ¿cat Robert,</hi> which makes the more agreeable <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> of the two.</p>

And I do not think it neceÅ¿Å¿ary, as I think I have told you elÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for a well-contrived Garden, to have at leaÅ¿t one Tree of every one of thoÅ¿e Å¿orts that are but reaÅ¿onably good; but my Judgment is, there Å¿hould be rather Å¿o many the more Trees of thoÅ¿e that are aÅ¿Å¿uredly Excellent. I know well enough, That we have more Å¿orts of pretty good <hi>Pears,</hi> than I have here placed; and accordingly as the Gardens I treat of, Å¿hall grow more Å¿pacious, I will not fail to place them Å¿ome in other kinds.</p>
                           <p>However, at leaÅ¿t, thus far I may Å¿ay, that without having in our little Gardens, one only bad Å¿ort of <hi>Pears,</hi> we can boaÅ¿t that there are to be found One and twenty of the beÅ¿t Å¿orts that are known, though there be in all but Four and Twenty <hi>Dwarf pear-trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I Å¿peak not yet of thoÅ¿e which are to be planted againÅ¿t Walls. And I have Å¿et down the Order of the Ripening and Mellowing of theÅ¿e Fruits, not only by Å¿pecifying the SeaÅ¿ons, but alÅ¿o by particulariÅ¿ing every Month of thoÅ¿e SeaÅ¿ons. There are Six Trees for the <hi>Summer,</hi> which are, one <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madam</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thigh,</hi> one Great <hi>Musked Blanquet</hi> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> one <hi>MuÅ¿cat Robert,</hi> one <hi>SkinleÅ¿s-pear,</hi> one <hi>Robine,</hi> and one <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet</hi> or <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿etin;</hi> Nine for the <hi>Autumn,</hi> in Å¿even kinds, which are, two <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears,</hi> two <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> one <hi>CraÅ¿anne,</hi> one <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire-John,</hi> one <hi>MarchioneÅ¿s,</hi> one <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonne</hi> or <hi>Good LouiÅ¿e,</hi> and one <hi>Petit-oin:</hi> And Nine for <hi>Winter,</hi> in Eight Kinds. This <hi>Winter SeaÅ¿on,</hi> beÅ¿ides a part of the <hi>Autumnal-pears,</hi> of which it has often the Advantage to make its Profit, glories very much in having one <hi>Winter Thorn-pear,</hi> one St. <hi>Germain,</hi> one <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> one <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erie,</hi> one <hi>Ambret,</hi> one <hi>Colmar,</hi> one St. <hi>AuguÅ¿tin</hi> and two <hi>Boncretien-trees,</hi> being all <hi>Pears</hi> of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity much further extended than that of the other SeaÅ¿ons; which if they be not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per excellent, yet we ought to comfort our Å¿elves and be content, Å¿ince, among all the great number the Earth brings forth to us, and that are come to our Knowledge, we have no better than thoÅ¿e which we have choÅ¿en.</p>
                           <p>I pretend to redouble the <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of our principal <hi>Pears,</hi> at leaÅ¿t Four or Five times over, before I multiply the others, and before I proceed to place a Å¿core of thoÅ¿e which we have mentioned in paÅ¿Å¿ing. I Å¿ee well enough they are extreamly eager to produce themÅ¿elves; but yet, methinke, whatever Merit they may have, and which I diÅ¿pute

them not, at leaÅ¿t upon the Foot it is on, I Å¿ay, I think I may affirm in regard to them, that all of them together durÅ¿t not preÅ¿ume to enter into ConteÅ¿tation againÅ¿t any of thoÅ¿e principal Å¿orts, though they Å¿hould take them one by one.</p>
                           <p>And therefore I muÅ¿t counÅ¿el them, to have patience yet for Å¿ome time, Å¿ince, in my Opinion, their Condition will not be over-unhappy if they be admitted to appear each of them once in great Gardens, after they have firÅ¿t Å¿een Four or Five of the moÅ¿t Honourable Places given to every one of them which are already actually eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, and which, if I may be permitted Å¿o to Å¿peak, are among our Fruits that which thoÅ¿e called the <hi>Keys</hi> in a Pack of Hounds are in Hunting.</p>
                           <p>This being Å¿etled, and we now beginning to enter into Gardens that are indifferent large, my Judgment is, That, to plant them Skilfully, we ought, firÅ¿t, to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ignment of a particular Canton or Plat of Ground for the Fruits of each SeaÅ¿on, that Å¿o they may not be confuÅ¿edly mix'd poll-moll one among the other, but that the <hi>Summer-</hi>Fruits may be in a place apart by themÅ¿elves, and thoÅ¿e of <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> in like manner by themÅ¿elves; for want of which Regulation, there happens Å¿everal Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which I elÅ¿ewhere Å¿hall lay open; and Å¿econdly, to aÅ¿Å¿ign every Tree its Place in the following Order, and conÅ¿equently to give,</p>

                              <hi>Pear</hi> is Excellent, and makes a very fine Tree; it is of a very agreeable Shape to look upon, being well made in its <hi>Pear,</hi> which is of a reaÅ¿onable bigneÅ¿s, near about that of the fair <hi>Bergamots:</hi> Its Colour is white on the one Å¿ide, and red on the other; its Pulp is between Å¿hort and tender, having a great deal of Juice accompanied with an agreeable Perfume; its unhappineÅ¿s is, That it comes in at the Å¿ame time with the <hi>Robins-pear,</hi> by which it is always eclipÅ¿ed, and with the good <hi>Peaches</hi> of the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> which hardly Å¿uffer any <hi>Pears</hi> in their Company; but however, I thing it worthy to enter at leaÅ¿t once into a Garden of ThreeÅ¿core and fifteen Trees.</p>
                           <p>As for the <hi>Orange-green-pear,</hi> it has a conÅ¿iderable great number of Å¿mall Friends: All the World knows it by its Name, and, in effect, it is a common and popular Pear, and which, in the time of our Fathers, made a pretty great Figure in Gardens; Å¿o that among all old Trees, we fail not to find a great many of this Å¿ort.

                           <p>In fine, the <hi>Doyennes</hi> or <hi>Dean-pear</hi> enters laÅ¿t into a Garden of ThreeÅ¿core and fifteen <hi>Dwarfarees,</hi> and performs its Duty not amiÅ¿s there: It is otherwiÅ¿e called the <hi>St. Michael,</hi>

It is of the bigneÅ¿s and Å¿hape of a fair <hi>Grey Butter-pear,</hi> and unhappily for it, comes in at the Å¿ame <note place="margin">Its DeÅ¿cription.</note> time with that <hi>Butter-pear;</hi> before which, in truth, for its Honour's Å¿ake, it ought almoÅ¿t never to appear: Its Picture tells us, That it has a thick Å¿hort Stalk, a very Å¿mooth Skin, a greeniÅ¿h Colour which grows very yellow when 'tis ripe; it is a right melting <hi>Pear,</hi> and its Juice is Å¿weet, but commonly 'tis Å¿uch a Å¿weetneÅ¿s that is not very noble, nor of no high reliÅ¿h, notwithÅ¿tanding I know not what little Perfume of which Å¿ometimes it has a Å¿mack, and which Å¿eems to me not worthy of any great EÅ¿teem: Its Pulp eaÅ¿ily grows Å¿oft, and as it were doughy and Å¿andy; Å¿o that 'tis Å¿omewhat difficult to nick the juÅ¿t time of gather gathering this <hi>Pear;</hi> but if care be taken togather it pretty green, and to Å¿erve it up before it has attained a clear yellow Colour, which is a mark of its over-Maturity, we may venture to let it Å¿hew it Å¿elf, without any fear of receiving any diÅ¿grace thereby.</p>
                           <p>I had one Year Å¿ome of them that proved Å¿o good, that I was almoÅ¿t ready to believe them of a particular Kind, but I never could Å¿ee the like Å¿ince: It has in all Å¿orts of Soils the advantage of being very Fruitful, which procures it among many of the midling
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48210:79"/>
Å¿ort of Gardeners, a very particular EÅ¿teem; and it has beÅ¿ides another advantage of being Beautiful, which, during the Month of <hi>October,</hi> gives it a place in all the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> Å¿erved up at great Tables. It meets with a good many curious PerÅ¿ons that much more value it than I do; but I cannot tell how to help it, and they muÅ¿t pardon me if I tell them, that I am almoÅ¿t aÅ¿hamed I have Å¿o well placed it. We have Å¿ince this little while a new <hi>Pear</hi> under the name of <hi>BeÅ¿i de la Motte,</hi> which pretty near reÅ¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <note place="margin">BeÅ¿i de la Motte, <hi>a new</hi> Pear <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed.</hi>

                           <p>Though thus far, in Å¿ome of theÅ¿e firÅ¿t Gardens, and, for Example, in that of Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿core and fifteen <hi>Pear-trees.</hi> The number of Å¿ome Kinds for <hi>Autumn,</hi> be very great in proportion to thoÅ¿e for <hi>Winter;</hi> for there are Twenty Å¿even Trees of the firÅ¿t Sorts, and but Thirty Å¿even of the other, yet I Å¿hould not be againÅ¿t any ones changing a little that Regulation, by retrenching a part even of the <hi>Summer-pears,</hi> which are to the number of Twelve, to multiply in their place, Å¿uch kinds of other SeaÅ¿ons as Å¿hould moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿e him.</p>
                           <p>And, for that reaÅ¿on, I Å¿hould think my Å¿elf much to blame, if when we Å¿hall all be Planting of great Gardens, I Å¿hould counÅ¿el all the World to place there for Example, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t as many <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears,</hi> or even of <hi>Butter-pears</hi> too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretiens, Ambrets, Virgoulees, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿eries, Thorn-pears, De la Fares, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, and I am aÅ¿Å¿ured, the great Lovers of thoÅ¿e good <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>Autumn,</hi> would not diÅ¿approve this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; I will Å¿ometimes multiply them, and Å¿ometimes alÅ¿o thoÅ¿e of the Second and Third <hi>ClaÅ¿s,</hi> but it Å¿hall be always with this ConÅ¿ideration, which ought to Å¿erve for a Rule to every Gard'ner, and which I propoÅ¿e to my Å¿elf as a Direction for every other PerÅ¿on in particular, that is to Å¿ay, that regularly we Å¿hould not Å¿trive to have more of each Å¿ort of Fruits, than juÅ¿t about what we may probably Å¿pend either our Å¿elves, or in our own Families, or in Entertainment of Freinds, without giving thoÅ¿e Fruits the time miÅ¿erably to rot and Å¿poil: Nay, I believe that thoÅ¿e <hi>Pears</hi> which have not the good Fortune to laÅ¿t long, and which, as well as we, have reaÅ¿on to envy that advantage to Å¿o many bad Å¿orts, which without any care, and as 'twere in Å¿pite of us, keep eaÅ¿ily till the coming in of the next <hi>Summer-fruits;</hi> I believe, I Å¿ay, that thoÅ¿e good <hi>Pears</hi> would think themÅ¿elves offended, if we Å¿hould multiply them in Å¿uch a manner, that inÅ¿tead of being all of them employed whilÅ¿t in their perfect Maturity, in performing their Duty to Mankind, a great part of them Å¿hould Å¿ee themÅ¿elves inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly become unÅ¿erviceable, by being over-run with RottenneÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>For when we have but a little quantity of each Å¿ort of Fruit, it Å¿eldom happens we let them be Å¿poiled; no, we viÅ¿it them too often to give them time for that: Whereas, when we have a great abundance of them, nothing is Å¿o ordinary as to Å¿ee a good part of them Å¿poiled. And therefore in this point we ought judiciouÅ¿ly to determine what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity we Å¿hall, as near as can be computed, need to have of them according to our DeÅ¿igns; and according to that Foot, to proportion, as I have Å¿aid before, the number of Trees of each kind, which we are to Plant in our Garden.</p>
                           <p>There are Å¿ome of theÅ¿e Trees that are long before they come to bear, as the <hi>Ambret,</hi> the <hi>Robine,</hi> the <hi>Bourdon,</hi> the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet,</hi> the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> and above all the reÅ¿t, the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> the <hi>Colmar, &amp;c.</hi> And there are Å¿ome that are quick enough in producing, provided they be graffed on <hi>Quince-Å¿tocks,</hi> as the <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears,</hi> the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> the <hi>Doyennee</hi> or <hi>Dean-pear, &amp;c.</hi> But theÅ¿e laÅ¿t bear Å¿uch Fruits, that it is convenient to have a pretty good number of them, becauÅ¿e we eat a great many of them in their SeaÅ¿on, they coming in while the Weather is yet hot, and in a time in which we are not uÅ¿ed to be contented with half a <hi>Pear;</hi> for, in earneÅ¿t, a Man muÅ¿t eat a great many <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets, Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears, Butter-pears, Doyennee</hi> or <hi>Dean-pears, &amp;c.</hi> before he can Å¿atisfie his Appetite; and Nature, that is as well acquainted with our PaÅ¿Å¿ions as our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ities, and which intended equally to accommodate the one as well as the other, has, as we may Å¿ay, given to theÅ¿e latter Å¿orts of <hi>Pears</hi> the Gift of FruitfulneÅ¿s, as well as that of QuickneÅ¿s in Bearing, with deÅ¿ign, that in their SeaÅ¿on we might have a Å¿ufficient Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, Å¿ince we are in a Condition to Å¿pend them both with Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure.</p>
                           <p>It ought not then to be wondred at, if Å¿o far as in thoÅ¿e Sizes of Gardens that can hold but about Seventy five Trees, I deÅ¿ire there Å¿hould be almoÅ¿t as many Trees of thoÅ¿e Fruits that ripen, as 'twere, altogether, as of Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e that ripen Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively one after
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48210:80"/>
another, and which by conÅ¿equence, give us the time to make a commodious and regular ConÅ¿umption of them; for, as I have Å¿aid, when I come to treat of larger Plantations, I Å¿hall doubtleÅ¿s uÅ¿e much more moderation in regard to thoÅ¿e Fruits which keep but a little while, than to thoÅ¿e others that having the advantage of being good, as well as laÅ¿ting, will keep for Å¿everal Months together.</p>
                           <p>However I leave it to every curious PerÅ¿on, to multiply the Fruits of one SeaÅ¿on more than thoÅ¿e of another, according to his own Inclination or OccaÅ¿ions. For Å¿uch a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for Example, upon the conÅ¿ideration that he is to paÅ¿s Å¿uch and Å¿uch certain times in the Country, where he is frequently to entertain Company, muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily have more Fruits of the Months of <hi>September, October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> than of the other SeaÅ¿ons, and in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, the number of the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elets, Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears, Butter-pears, Doyennces</hi> or <hi>Dean-pears, Bergamots, MarchioneÅ¿Å¿es, LanÅ¿acs, CraÅ¿annes, Vine-pears, Petit-oins, LouiÅ¿e-bonnes</hi> or <hi>Good-LouiÅ¿es, BeÅ¿i de la Mottes,</hi> and even of <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire-Johns, &amp;c.</hi> muÅ¿t be augmented, and the kinds proportionably diminiÅ¿hed. And for another Gentleman, on the contrary, for other good ReaÅ¿ons, as for Example, becauÅ¿e he cannot go into the Country to Å¿pend the <hi>Summer-</hi>Fruits, nor can have them brought him from thence, it is abÅ¿olutely expedient to have only good Å¿tore of <hi>Winter-</hi>Fruits: It will be moÅ¿t conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment largely to multiply the <hi>Virgoulees, Winter-Boncretiens, Thorn-pears, Ambrets, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Colmars, La Fares, St. AuguÅ¿tins, Dry Martins, PaÅ¿tourelles, &amp;c.</hi> and to reduce the Fruits of the other SeaÅ¿ons to a Å¿maller Number.</p>
                           <p>It is very certain, that my true DeÅ¿ign in this TreatiÅ¿e of the Choice and Proportion of Fruits, was without any regard to Å¿uch particular CircumÅ¿tances as theÅ¿e, which may be infinite, whether in reÅ¿pect of every Head of a particular <hi>Family,</hi> or in regard of Å¿uch as are Heads of <hi>Communities,</hi> and indeed it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible it Å¿hould provide for them: No, it was chiefly intended only for the Curious in general, who deÅ¿ire to have regularly and equally all the year long, as great Å¿tore as can be of the choiceÅ¿t Fruits out of their Gardens, of what bigneÅ¿s Å¿oever they be: And as for the reÅ¿t of the Curious, they may from the Knowledge I here have communicated of the good Fruits of every SeaÅ¿on, and of the laÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each kind of them, gather Å¿ufficient Directions to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them in making Å¿uch deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations thereupon, which Å¿hall be moÅ¿t conformable to their Intentions.</p>
                           <p>To continue then at preÅ¿ent, what I have begun for the firÅ¿t Å¿ort of curious PerÅ¿ons, I think, we ought to give.</p>

The <hi>Bourdon,</hi> or <hi>Humble-Bee-pear,</hi> is a <hi>Pear</hi> of the end of <hi>July,</hi> which for its BigneÅ¿s, <note place="margin">The <hi>Bourdon,</hi> or <hi>Humble-Bee-Pear</hi> DeÅ¿cribed.</note> quality of its Pulp, its TaÅ¿te, its Perfume, and its Juice, as well as for the time of its Ripening, very much reÅ¿embles the <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Robert,</hi> and is little different from it in its Stalk, which is longer in this than in that.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>Maudlin-pear</hi> is a <hi>Pear</hi> that is greeniÅ¿h and pretty tender, and approaching very <note place="margin">The <hi>Maudlin-Pear</hi> DeÅ¿cribed.</note> near in Å¿hape to the <hi>Bergamot:</hi> It ripens at the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and Å¿o is one of the firÅ¿t <hi>Pears</hi> of the <hi>Summer;</hi> but it is very apt to deceive us, if we Å¿tay till it begins to grow Yellow before we gather it, becauÅ¿e then it is paÅ¿t its goodneÅ¿s, and is grown Doughy.</p>
                           <p>The Compounded Name the <hi>Sugar-green-pear</hi> bears, deÅ¿cribes to us at the Å¿ame time both its Juice and its Colour: If it were a little bigger, it might be taken for a <hi>Winter-Thorn-pear,</hi>

                              <hi>Flowr'd Pear,</hi> not to Eat Raw, though Å¿ome certain PerÅ¿ons like it well enough Å¿o too, finding that in it, which I do not, that is, Å¿omething pleaÅ¿ant in its Pulp, and in its TaÅ¿te; But I eÅ¿teem it firÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it is altogether beautiful to look upon, it being really a large Å¿lat <hi>Pear</hi> with a long Å¿trait Å¿talk, a Å¿mooth skin, BluÅ¿h-coloured on one Å¿ide, and Yellow on the other; in the Å¿econd place, there being no Å¿rcuple made in letting it appear in great DiÅ¿hes of Fruit; I priÅ¿e it for the Å¿ervice it renders on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions: And laÅ¿tly, becauÅ¿e after it has made an agreeable figure for Å¿everal days together, and that by often handling, it begins to looÅ¿e the Flower of its lovely Colour, and to grow quite dull and blackiÅ¿h, it then remains in a condition to Å¿ignalize its true Excellency; for it is moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably employed in making one of the lovelieÅ¿t and beÅ¿t <hi>Compot's,</hi> or Wet Sweet-meats in the World, having a Marrowy Pulp, without being incommoded with the leaÅ¿t Å¿tonineÅ¿s, and having above all, abundance of Juice, that eaÅ¿ily takes a beautiful Colour over the Fire; Å¿o that, in my judgment, and according to my Palate, all that together affords me great ReaÅ¿ons to eÅ¿teem this <hi>Pear,</hi> though I Å¿hould only conÅ¿ider it as particularly good to PreÅ¿erve, or otherwiÅ¿e prepare by Fire.</p>
                           <p>It is likewiÅ¿e well known, that the <hi>Franc-Real,</hi> or <hi>Frank-Royal,</hi> which Å¿ome name, the <note place="margin">The <hi>Frank-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pear</hi> DeÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note>

                           <p>I cannot here forbear expreÅ¿Å¿ing Å¿ome Regret, that among Å¿o many <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> I find Å¿o few <hi>Boncretiens,</hi> and no <hi>Autumnal Bergamots;</hi> I have already declared the ReaÅ¿ons I had for that, which were the hopes we had to have a pretty good number of <hi>Wall-trees</hi> of both of them; and becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Grounds that are Å¿ubject to be Cold and MoiÅ¿t, are altogether fatal to them. But if our Ground be reaÅ¿onably dry, becauÅ¿e we have a very great Inconvenience to fear from the <hi>Tyger-Babs,</hi> a curÅ¿ed little volatile InÅ¿ect that horridly deÅ¿troys the <hi>Wall-pears,</hi> and hinders us from planting many of them, eÅ¿pecially in the good ExpoÅ¿itions of the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> I Å¿ay therefore, if our Ground has not that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of being too Cold and MoiÅ¿t, it will be convenient enough to Plant in it a good number of <hi>Boncretion Dwarf-trees.</hi>

                           <p>The <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Boncretien</hi> is almoÅ¿t of all the <hi>Pears,</hi> that which has puzzled me moÅ¿t, and Å¿o much, that I am almoÅ¿t aÅ¿hamed to tell it; I found my Å¿elf naturally inclined to eÅ¿teem <note place="margin">The <hi>SraniÅ¿h-Boucretien-Pear</hi> deÅ¿cribed.</note> it at firÅ¿t for its Å¿hape, for one can hardly forbear it. It is a great thick long <hi>Pear,</hi> and handÅ¿omly made into a Pyramidal Form, reÅ¿embling altogether in that, a very Beautiful <hi>Winter Boncretien,</hi> from whence proceeded the fineÅ¿t Name it bears; it is on one Å¿ide paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a lovely bright red, all Å¿peckled with little black Å¿pecks, on the other Å¿ide it is of a whitiÅ¿h Yellow. Its Pulp eats the Å¿horteÅ¿t of all the <hi>Pears</hi> I know: It has ordinarily a Å¿weet Å¿ugred and indifferent good Juice, when it grows in good Ground, and comes to its perfect mellowneÅ¿s, which happens commonly from mid-<hi>November</hi> to the <hi>middle</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and Å¿ometimes laÅ¿ts till <hi>January.</hi> It was for all thoÅ¿e qualities, that for two or three Years together, I had conceived a great EÅ¿teem for it; but, beÅ¿ides, that in that very Å¿ame SeaÅ¿on, we have all our principal tender and melting <hi>Pears,</hi> I have for more than Twenty Years, always found its Pulp Å¿o harÅ¿h and groÅ¿s, and Å¿o Å¿tony, and particularly in Years or Grounds that are a little moiÅ¿t, that at laÅ¿t, in Å¿pite of my firÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, I was forced to reÅ¿olve to deny it Entrance into many Gardens; and Å¿o I am of Opinion, that we ought to be content to Å¿uffer at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome Trees of it in thoÅ¿e Gardens where the number of <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> exceeds two Hundred and Fifty, and where the Soil is indifferent good: It having always this Advantage, That it contributes much with its good Meen and lovely Appearance, to the adorning of <hi>Fruit-Pyramids.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Salviati</hi> altogether reÅ¿embles a <hi>BeÅ¿idery</hi> in its Shape, but not in Colour: It is a pretty <note place="margin">The <hi>Salviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> deÅ¿cribed.</note> big round <hi>Pear,</hi> with a pretty long and Å¿mall Stalk Å¿et in a little hollow, with an Eye or Crown alÅ¿o a little hollow and Å¿mall; it is of a yellow ruÅ¿Å¿et-whitiÅ¿h Colour; thoÅ¿e that have great red Å¿treaks, have a pretty rough Skin, but thoÅ¿e who are without that red are Å¿oft-skin'd enough: Its Pulp is tender, but not very fine; its Juice is Å¿ugred and perfumed, coming nearer in TaÅ¿te to that of the <hi>Robine,</hi> than of the <hi>Orange-pear:</hi> But this Juice is but in little quantity; the <hi>Pear</hi> is pretty good, and would be Å¿till better received, if it came not in with the <hi>Peaches</hi> of the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and of the Beginning of <hi>September.</hi>

                              <hi>Musked-pear,</hi> is a <hi>Pear</hi> of the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> coming pretty near both in bigneÅ¿s and Å¿hape to a <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Robert:</hi> It has a fine Skin, its Colour is a pale Yellow tinged a little with Red on that Å¿ide next the Sun; its Pulp is a little firm, Å¿o that it is not without Å¿ome earthy and Å¿tony Matter, but the Juice is very Å¿weet and Å¿ugred, and upon that account is not unworthy to appear here.</p>

And here methinks, I Å¿ee a great many diÅ¿contented PerÅ¿ons murmuring at my choice: And they are the Lovers of certain kinds of <hi>Pears,</hi> of which I have not yet Å¿poken, which are, the <hi>Cat-burnt-pear,</hi> the <hi>EngliÅ¿h-pear,</hi> the <hi>Winter Lemon-pear,</hi> the <hi>Winter RuÅ¿Å¿elet,</hi> the <hi>Brutte bonne,</hi> or <hi>Chew-good,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, and there are Å¿ome among them that love the <hi>RoÅ¿e-pear,</hi> the <hi>Caillot RoÅ¿at,</hi> or <hi>RoÅ¿ie-pebble,</hi> the <hi>Tulipt Orange-pear,</hi> the <hi>Villain-pear</hi> of <hi>Anjou, &amp;c.</hi> and who yet durÅ¿t hardly Å¿peak their Minds. Both the one and the other Å¿ort of Gentlemen have fought for theÅ¿e <hi>Pears</hi> in the Gardens I have been juÅ¿t now modelling, and not finding them there, every one of them in particular has, as 'twere taken offence at it, and at the Å¿ame time would fain make me paÅ¿s for a Man that does not know all the good Fruits yet, or at leaÅ¿t for one that is led away by prejudice.</p>
                           <p>To which I anÅ¿wer, That I am willing theÅ¿e Gentlemen Å¿hould every one of them be free to think <hi>thoÅ¿e Pears</hi> they Å¿peak of good enough to plant in their Gardens, and in that caÅ¿e I willingly conÅ¿ent they Å¿hould continue to praiÅ¿e them, to multiply them, and employ as much Rhetorick in their PraiÅ¿es as they pleaÅ¿e: Let them only do me that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remember what I Å¿aid at the beginning of this TreatiÅ¿e concerning the DiverÅ¿ity of Palats, of Soils and of Years, and to be pleaÅ¿ed to permit me to tell them in my JuÅ¿tifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That what made me Reject thoÅ¿e Fruits about which they are Å¿candalized, was certainly nothing elÅ¿e but becauÅ¿e for Twenty Years together, I had found them conÅ¿tantly rather bad than good, in Å¿pite of all the InduÅ¿try I had uÅ¿e in their Cultivation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becauÅ¿e they may happen to meet with certain CircumÅ¿tances very favourable to that Merit they Å¿ometimes have, I Å¿hall now, at laÅ¿t, in our great Gardens, do them that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice I think due to them.</p>

might well be taken for one indeed, eÅ¿pecially when it is round enough: Its Pulp is very hard and Å¿tony, and full of earthy matter, and we cannot Å¿ay its excellency conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in that; but it has a good deal of Juice, which is extreamly Musked, and it is that, that has procured it Å¿ome friends for the Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February.</hi>

                           <p>I begin to be perÅ¿waded, That my exactneÅ¿s in well chuÅ¿ing theÅ¿e Five hundred <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> will give light enough to our new beginners in theÅ¿e CurioÅ¿ities, to direct them how to order things if any occaÅ¿ions preÅ¿ent themÅ¿elves which require more Trees; and eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially there being hardly any need, after Å¿o many as we have Å¿et down, to employ any more new kinds, they may Å¿ee, that in every Hundred of augmentation of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> I ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily augment firÅ¿t for the <hi>Summer,</hi> but about the Å¿ixth or Å¿eventh part in the Hundred, and that Å¿till in diminiÅ¿hing them too proportionably as the Plantations augment in number of Trees; as well, becauÅ¿e if there be walling enough to permit it, there is always a part of it allotted for Å¿ome <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of that SeaÅ¿on, as for Example, for <hi>Little MuÅ¿cats</hi> or <hi>Musk-pears, CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madams</hi> or <hi>Lady-thighs, Robines, RuÅ¿Å¿eltes, &amp;c.</hi> which Å¿upplies the Defect of <hi>Dwarf-trees;</hi> or, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits are to be look'd upon as Fruits that paÅ¿s off very Å¿wiftly, and are but of very Å¿mall Duration, Å¿o that when the Quantity of them is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ive, they do us but very little Honour and Profit.</p>
                           <p>Add to this, That I Å¿eldom fail in Plantations that are any thing conÅ¿iderable, to plant Å¿ome <hi>Standard-trees</hi> of the principal of thoÅ¿e Sorts in Symetry, as being an aÅ¿Å¿ured means to have from them much better Fruit, and in greater plenty too.</p>
                           <p>In the Å¿econd place, in reÅ¿pect of the <hi>Autumnal</hi> Fruits, I have at leaÅ¿t the Å¿ame regard for them, as for thoÅ¿e which I have juÅ¿t now Å¿poke of; and I look upon the <hi>Bergamot</hi> with the Å¿ame conÅ¿ideration I have always expreÅ¿Å¿ed for it, yet I have planted but one or two <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of it in the number of Five hundred, though it be one of the Fruits for the abundance of which, I leaÅ¿t pretend to forget to provide: But as all the World knows, 'tis hardly poÅ¿Å¿ible to have any competent quantity of theÅ¿e <hi>Pears,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be againÅ¿t Walls.</p>
                           <p>It is no very hard Matter to conclude from thence, that doubtleÅ¿s I will make great Wall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>We are going to plant then good Å¿tore of <hi>Bergamots,</hi> and I Å¿uppoÅ¿e that work already
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48210:86"/>
begun as Å¿oon as ever we found our Å¿elves in a condition to do that Honour to this <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Pears,</hi> I therefore return now from that DigreÅ¿Å¿ion, to tell you, that in every Hundreds increaÅ¿e of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> the number of thoÅ¿e that furniÅ¿h the Fruits for the <hi>Autumnal</hi> SeaÅ¿on, muÅ¿t not be augmented above a Å¿eventh or eighth part, becauÅ¿e of the Å¿mall duration of moÅ¿t of them, and their too great aptneÅ¿s to corrupt and rot. But that yet on the other Å¿ide, the pleaÅ¿ure we take then in devouring a great many of them, and the SeaÅ¿on which draws great Companies together, and engages People to make Å¿ome Abode in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are always as a kind of Mariners CompaÅ¿s, which ought to guide us in the model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and perfecting our Plantations, and direct us accordingly to Plant a greater or leÅ¿Å¿er number of Trees.</p>
                           <p>There remains now then the <hi>Winter</hi> Fruits, which every where are to make up the main Body of ReÅ¿erve; Å¿o that in every Hundred of <hi>Dwarf trees,</hi> they ordinarily Å¿hould aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about three Quarters of the four. And if my advices have the gift to pleaÅ¿e you, pray let care be taken to multiply thoÅ¿e Sorts leaÅ¿t, which I multiply here as 'twere blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and at a venture.</p>
                           <p>And now, without engaging my Å¿elf to draw out a plot at length of Six hundred <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> Å¿uch a one as I have done above for the preceding Five Centuries, that is, to Å¿et down exactly, and one after another, every kind of Fruit, and every Å¿ingle Tree-Å¿tock, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order in which every one of them in particular ought to be admitted into the Garden. I Å¿hall content my Å¿elf only to tell you at once, That beÅ¿ides the Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred already regulated, I will add to make up the Å¿ixth hundred, about Ten <hi>Summer Pear-trees,</hi> Eighteen <hi>Autumnal,</hi> and ThreeÅ¿core and twelve <hi>Winter</hi> ones.</p>
                           <p>I do not at all wonder, if they who have great Plantations to make, find themÅ¿elves puÅ¿led about the choice of the number of their Trees; for, I believe, they would be much more perplexed, if they were put to cultivate every particular themÅ¿elves, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off that trouble to their Gardeners, as moÅ¿t of them unluckily enough do. And I confeÅ¿s in good truth, that 'tis a matter that appears to me like an AbyÅ¿s of an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable Depth; and that I find an unÅ¿peakable difficulty in it, when I go about to mark out the Quantities as 'twere with a CompaÅ¿s, in order to regulate the Å¿everal kinds of Fruits by exact proportions.</p>
                           <p>ThoÅ¿e great <hi>Plantations</hi> Å¿trike me with Terrour, how much accuÅ¿tomed Å¿oever I may be to them; nay, and I believe 'tis becauÅ¿e I am accuÅ¿tomed to them, that I have Å¿o clear a ProÅ¿pect of the Hazards and Inconveniences with which they circumvent Men, and from thence too it is, that I have Å¿o often before my Eyes, and in my Mouth, and at the point of my Pen. <hi>Laudato ingentia rura, exiguum Colito.</hi>

If it happens, as doubtleÅ¿s it does, that we come at laÅ¿t to compaÅ¿s within a little, what we propoÅ¿ed to our Å¿elves, I am Å¿ure, that after all, we are Å¿till at leaÅ¿t at as much loÅ¿s as ever, what to do with our Fruits.</p>
                           <p>It would be now quickly time for me to begin to plant a few Trees of thoÅ¿e Fruits, that are at leaÅ¿t fit to conttibute to the Ornament of the Pyramids; and I think nothing can be Å¿aid againÅ¿t it, when once we are come to planting of Six or Seven hundred <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of other Å¿orts: And therefore now we may conveniently enough place among them Å¿ome <hi>Summer Boncretiens,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e called <hi>Graccioli,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Pears</hi> called <hi>Supremes,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Admiral Pears,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Summer Mouille-Bouches,</hi> or <hi>MoiÅ¿ten-mouths,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>BelliÅ¿Å¿imes,</hi> or Super-fair <hi>Pears,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>De bouge Pears,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Grillands,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Gilogiles, &amp;c.</hi> I do but only name them here in paÅ¿Å¿ing, that our curious Gentlemen that know them by their Names, mny plant Å¿ome Trees of them, if they pleaÅ¿e, for as for my Å¿elf, Å¿o long as I Å¿hall follow my own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I Å¿hall hardly plant any of them.</p>
                           <p>Therefore to proceed, as I have begun, I adviÅ¿e that the Ten <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to be added to make up Six hundred Trees, be</p>

Add to that, that all the World are particularly deÅ¿irous to have air round about their HouÅ¿es, and none care to Å¿uffer any thing near them that may hinder its free acceÅ¿Å¿ion; and that's one of the principal ReaÅ¿ons which makes every one deÅ¿ire at leaÅ¿t little Gardens, when they cannot have great ones.</p>
                        <p>We will therefore plant no <hi>Standard</hi> Trees any where but in great Gardens, and there too we will plant but a Å¿mall number, which ordinarily amounts not to above one Tree for every Square in a Kitching Garden. I have uÅ¿ed my Å¿elf to two Å¿everal Methods in this Matter, which Å¿ucceed not amiÅ¿s, one is to plant them all along the Å¿ides of thoÅ¿e great Alleys or Walks that croÅ¿s the Garden, and always at a good diÅ¿tance from any Walls, excepting thoÅ¿e of the <hi>North;</hi> and the other is, to place them in the midÅ¿t of the Squares, that is to Å¿ay, one in every Square.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:48210:88"/>
In the firÅ¿t manner particularly, becauÅ¿e the greateÅ¿t part of their Å¿hadow falls common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Walks, none of the Trees can do any harm to the little Plants growing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, nor to the good Wall Trees which are far enough off of them: And in the Å¿econd manner, there is nothing to intercept or cloud the Å¿ight, becauÅ¿e the Squares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ordinarily at leaÅ¿t ThreeÅ¿core, or ThreeÅ¿core and twelve Foot every way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿eparated from one another by Å¿ome Alleys or Walks, the Standard Trees in them will be at a very conÅ¿iderable diÅ¿tance one from another, and the number of thoÅ¿e Squares being not very great, the number of the Standard Trees in them can be but moderate neither, there being very few Kitchen-Gardens Å¿o proportioned, and Å¿o deÅ¿igned out, as we have expreÅ¿Å¿ed, that can have above Thirty Å¿uch Trees.</p>
                        <p>Now for this purpoÅ¿e, I either chuÅ¿e Trees of thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of Fruits which are not very big, and yet are of great increaÅ¿e, and are good when they fall, that is to Å¿ay, of Å¿ome <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits, becauÅ¿e their Å¿mallneÅ¿s preÅ¿erves them from bruiÅ¿ing, and their ripeneÅ¿s which looÅ¿ens them from the Tree, makes them fit to be eaten preÅ¿ently with pleaÅ¿ure, when any of them happen to be battered in falling.</p>
                        <p>Or elÅ¿e I chuÅ¿e thoÅ¿e kinds which hold faÅ¿t by their Stalks, and Å¿uch whoÅ¿e Fruits are very hard in themÅ¿elves, as are the Å¿mall <hi>Winter</hi> Fruits and <hi>Baking-pears;</hi> Å¿o that they are not eaÅ¿ily Å¿haken down by Winds, nor when they fall Å¿o apt to be much endamaged thereby.</p>
                        <p>Among the <hi>Summer-Fruits</hi> proper to be planted in the form of Standard-trees, I do not comprehend the <hi>little MuÅ¿cat-pear,</hi> though for its bigneÅ¿s and Å¿eaÅ¿on it might Å¿eem fitter than any other; no, the Canker which is apt to Seize on its Wood, and quite Å¿poil it, hinders me to my great regret from planting any Trees of it in this faÅ¿hion; But that which I moÅ¿t willingly plant in this manner, is firÅ¿t, of <hi>Summer-Fruits</hi> (mark here the order of my choice) The <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet, the CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thigh,</hi> the <hi>Great Blanquet,</hi>

                        <p>There we have about twenty four Å¿orts of Standard <hi>Pear-trees</hi> to plant proÅ¿perouÅ¿ly enough in our Gardens; But becauÅ¿e in Important places, as for example, in fine Kitching-Gardens, Baking and PreÅ¿erving Fruits are not conÅ¿iderable enough to be allowed any <note place="margin">Bakeing and PreÅ¿erving <hi>Pears,</hi> with <hi>Cherries,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Apples,</hi> &amp;c. beÅ¿t Planted apart in Å¿eparate Orchards.</note> room, and becauÅ¿e (as it is expedient for all them that conveniently can) we may have Å¿ome of them in the Å¿eparate Orchards, deÅ¿igned only for Fruit, together with all Å¿orts of <hi>Cherry-trees, Agriots, Bigarros, Guignes,</hi> with all Å¿orts of good <hi>Apples, Pippins, Calvils, Apis, Fenouillets,</hi> or <hi>Fennel-Apple, Courpendus,</hi> or <hi>Short Hung,</hi> or <hi>Short Stalked Apples,</hi> &amp;c. with Å¿ome good Å¿orts of <hi>Plums,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, of <hi>Damask Plums of all Å¿orts,</hi> of <hi>Mirabelles,</hi> St. <hi>Catherines, Diapred Damasks,</hi> &amp;c. and laÅ¿tly with <hi>Mulberry-trees, Almond-trees, Azerol,</hi> or Garden <hi>Haw-trees,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore I Å¿ay, Å¿ince for theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons, Fruits for Baking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may without any diÅ¿honour to them, be planted elÅ¿ewhere, far off from our Kitching-Gardens, we Å¿hould in their Å¿tead, particularly Multiply Å¿ome Trees of the principal Å¿orts of our <hi>Summer-Fruits.</hi> I know the voice of all the World, as well as mine own will preÅ¿ently give the firÅ¿t choice to the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elet-pears;</hi> Å¿o that we Å¿hall not think much to have at leaÅ¿t four great Trees of them to one of each of the other Å¿orts: The <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿elin,</hi> the <hi>LanÅ¿ac,</hi> the <hi>Ambret,</hi> and the <hi>Dry Martin,</hi> are likewiÅ¿e Trees that require each of them to be doubled before we double the other Kinds. A <hi>Summer Pear-tree</hi> that has been planted ten or twelve Years, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of yielding Å¿o great a quantity of Fruit of its kind, that 'twill be all we can do to Å¿pend them before the RottenneÅ¿s that follows cloÅ¿e after their RipeneÅ¿s, makes them good for nothing: And therefore, when we are contriving Plantations of Fruit-trees, we Å¿hould Å¿till remember when we intermix in them any Standard-trees, that we muÅ¿t proportionably diminiÅ¿h the number of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> which we Å¿hould otherwiÅ¿e be obliged to have of thoÅ¿e Å¿ame kinds.</p>
                        <p>Methinks 'tis not amiÅ¿s to add here this Caution, that in reÅ¿pect of theÅ¿e Standard-trees, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Standards</hi> to be much leÅ¿s Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their Heads than <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> to make them bear Å¿o much the Å¿oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> it is good in planting them, to leave them Å¿ome of the branches of their tops which they had when in the NurÅ¿ery Garden, becauÅ¿e they will bear Fruit Å¿o much the Å¿ooner, and becauÅ¿e the heighth of their Trunks is not Å¿o exactly regulated as that of the <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> whether that heighth begin a foot higher or lower, their Å¿hape will be never the leÅ¿s comly for that, and it is always a conÅ¿iderable advantage, this Å¿ort of Trees may be made to afford us of advancing their FruitfulneÅ¿s, which we can hardly ever draw from the <hi>Dwarf-trees.</hi>

I have hitherto examined only the Conduct we are to obÅ¿erve in diÅ¿poÅ¿ing the good <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> to have as many of them in our Gardens, as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible, as well in the form of <hi>Dwarf,</hi> as Standard-trees: But I have not yet Å¿poken of thoÅ¿e great <hi>Boncretien Pear-trees</hi> they have in the Courts of Å¿ome HouÅ¿es in many Provinces in the hotter Climates, nor of Å¿ome other more common <hi>Pear-trees</hi> which they have in other parts, in other Courts.</p>
                        <p>Nor have I yet Å¿poken any thing of the great <hi>Pear</hi> plantations, planted for the making of <hi>Perry</hi> in thoÅ¿e places where Vines cannot proÅ¿per. As to the two firÅ¿t points, becauÅ¿e I have nothing to Å¿ay to them, as being of no manner of conÅ¿equence, but only barely for the pleaÅ¿ure of Å¿ome particular PerÅ¿ons, I leave it wholly to each perÅ¿on to do in them what he Å¿hall find beÅ¿t for his own Å¿atisfaction; for the Å¿ucceÅ¿s he Å¿hall meet with may Å¿erve him for a Rule.</p>
                        <p>However, 'tis convenient to advertiÅ¿e you, that in places, which we Å¿ay, are much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed to the <note n="*" place="margin">That is, places near High-ways, where many People paÅ¿s.</note> 
                           <hi>Secular Arm,</hi> we ought to have this fore-caÅ¿t, not to plant any Fruit there that is eatable whilÅ¿t on the Tree, otherwiÅ¿e 'tis certain, all the Fruit that will come to the Owner from thence will be only a great deal of Vexation, and little elÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>As for what concerns the plantations of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> or <hi>Apple-trees</hi> deÅ¿igned for the making of <hi>Cyder</hi> or <hi>Perry;</hi> I Å¿hall content my Å¿elf with only telling you, that in them, the Trees are planted at threeÅ¿core, or threeÅ¿core and twelve foot, one from another, becauÅ¿e that proportion obÅ¿erved, hinders not the Grounds in which they grow, at leaÅ¿t for Å¿everal Years together, from being Å¿own Yearly with good Corn, the Plowing up, and other Culture uÅ¿ed for the latter, extreamly contributing to the well cultivating of the other: I leave what is more to be Å¿aid to this Article, to the DiÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of thoÅ¿e to whom thoÅ¿e Liquors are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, or at leaÅ¿t very convenient, or which as paÅ¿Å¿ionately love them as I do good Fruits which are the chief delights of the Nobility and Gentry.</p>
                        <p>It is now time to examine what Å¿orts of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> we Å¿hall plant againÅ¿t Walls, I know very well there is not any Å¿ort of them which that Situation would not very well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date by contributing much to the largeneÅ¿s of their Fruit, and the certainty of their bearing and bringing their productions to perfection, when the Å¿piteful <hi>Tyger-Babbs</hi> will give them leave to do it; But I likewiÅ¿e no leÅ¿s certainly know, that that there are Å¿ome of <note place="margin">To what <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> the Wall is abÅ¿olutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary.</note> them which Å¿tand Å¿o much in need of the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Wall, that they cannot live and thrive without it. And we have hinted in Å¿everal places in the foregoing part of this TreatiÅ¿e, that the <hi>Bergamots</hi> particularly lay under this neceÅ¿Å¿ity, and the little <hi>MuÅ¿cat-pears</hi> Å¿till more than they: The Wall is further indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably requiÅ¿ite for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of well Coloured <hi>Boncretiens.</hi> But becauÅ¿e if we have never Å¿o few Walls expoÅ¿ed to a kindly Sun, we ought to have Å¿o much regard to them as to employ them as uÅ¿efully as they deÅ¿erve, and according to the importance of the Fruits that challange place there, I think I ought to treat of the <hi>Pears</hi> that may be planted in that Scituation, before I come to treat particularly of the order which is to be obÅ¿erved for the filling up every Wall with all Å¿orts of good Fruits, as well as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible to fill them; and that is the order I propoÅ¿ed to my Å¿elf at the very beginning of this TreatiÅ¿e: After I have drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a particular LiÅ¿t of the firÅ¿t Five Hundred <hi>Dwarf-pear-trees</hi> which I have placed here a little above, and after I have told you in particular, which, in my opinion, are the <hi>Good-pears,</hi> which the <hi>Indifferent ones,</hi> and laÅ¿tly which are they that are Å¿o bad, that I would adviÅ¿e no body to plant them at all, I will conclude this Chapter, with informing you what other Fruits, beÅ¿ides <hi>Pears,</hi> proÅ¿per well upon <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and then proceed to Å¿peak of all Å¿orts of <hi>Wall-Fruits,</hi> and of the method of diÅ¿poÅ¿ing them, in a Å¿eparate DiÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>

                        <p>Among the <hi>Apples</hi> that are good to Eat Raw, or Baked, or otherwiÅ¿e prepared, (for <note place="margin">Seven principal Å¿orts of Fating and PreÅ¿erving Apples.</note> I meddle not here with <hi>Cyder-Apples,)</hi> I count Seven principal Å¿orts, that is to Å¿ay, the <hi>Gray-Pippin,</hi> the <hi>White,</hi> or <hi>Frank-Pippin,</hi> the <hi>Autumn Calvill,</hi> the <hi>Fennellet,</hi> or <hi>Fennell-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Cour-pendu,</hi> or <hi>Å¿hort-hung,</hi> or <hi>Å¿hort-Å¿talk'd-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Api,</hi> and the <hi>Violet-Apple.</hi> There are Å¿ome others which I prize not Å¿o much, tho' they are no bad Fruit, as the <hi>Rambour,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Other Å¿orts leÅ¿s valuable, but yet good.</note> the <hi>Summer-Calvill,</hi> the <hi>CouÅ¿inotte,</hi> the <hi>Orgeran,</hi> the <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the <hi>Thick Pairmain,</hi> the <hi>Ice-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Francatu,</hi> the <hi>Hiute-BontÃ©e,</hi> or <hi>High-goodneÅ¿s,</hi> the <hi>Royalty,</hi> the <hi>Rouvezeau,</hi> the <hi>CheÅ¿nut-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Pigconnet,</hi> or <hi>Pigcon-Apple,</hi> the <hi>PaÅ¿s-pomme,</hi> or <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿ing-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Petit-bon,</hi> or <hi>Small-good,</hi> the <hi>Fig-Apple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>I know not above two or three Å¿orts that are bigger than the others, namely, the <hi>Rambours,</hi> the <hi>Calvills,</hi> and the <hi>Ice-Applos,</hi> and but three or four that are more long

                        <p>The Two Å¿orts of <hi>Pippins</hi> are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by the Two Names of <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>White</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The Two Å¿orts of <hi>Pippins, Gray</hi> and <hi>VVhite.</hi>

In Å¿ine, it may be Å¿aid, to the advantage of theÅ¿e Pippins, that they are very profitably made uÅ¿e of almoÅ¿t all the Year long; and to their diÅ¿advantage, it may be no leÅ¿s truly affirmed, that their Neighbourhood is infinitely diÅ¿agreeable and incommodious.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumnal-Calvills</hi> reÅ¿emble one another pretty near in their lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿h Å¿hape, and in their Colour, which is of a Blood-Red, but yet the <hi>Summer-Calvill</hi> is <note place="margin">

the <hi>Surface,</hi> and outward <hi>Crust</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> By the means of theÅ¿e little <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> I have the convenience to allow my Å¿elf almoÅ¿t as many <hi>Trees</hi> of one Å¿ort of <hi>Apples,</hi> as of the other, and Å¿ince theÅ¿e little <hi>Trees</hi> are agreeable enough to the Å¿ight in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> it follows naturally enough from thence, that they produce no ill effect in little ones.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore we have nothing elÅ¿e to do but to determine what kinds of them to <note place="margin">What proportion of Trees of each choice Å¿ort of Apples, it is beÅ¿t to plant, from the total Number of Fifty, to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundreds.</note> plant, and what number of each kind, and this is my Method with them; if I have room enough to plant a conÅ¿iderable number of them, as for Example, from fifty, to one or two hundred; I plant two thirds of the total number, of theÅ¿e four Å¿orts, <hi>Gray-pippins, White-pippins, Autumn-Calvills,</hi> and <hi>Apis-apples,</hi> of each an equal number; and for the remaining third part, I divide it into three portions, which I employ in <hi>Trees</hi> of theÅ¿e three other kinds, <hi>viz.

                        </p>
                        <p>And proceeding in this manner, in fifty <hi>Apple-Trees,</hi> I Å¿hall have eight <hi>Gray Pippin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,</hi> eight of <hi>White Pippins,</hi> eight <hi>Autumn-Calvills,</hi> eight <hi>Apis,</hi> Å¿ix <hi>Fennelets,</hi> Å¿ix <hi>Cour-pendu's,</hi> and Å¿ix <hi>Violet-apples.</hi> In a hundred <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> I Å¿hall have Å¿ixteen of each of the four firÅ¿t principal Å¿orts, and twelve of each of the other three, and Å¿o proportionably in the number of two hundred. But when we Å¿hall have occaÅ¿ion to plant three, four, or five hundred, I Å¿hall mix with them a twelfth part compoÅ¿ed of <hi>Summer-Calvills</hi> and <hi>Rambours;</hi> and Å¿o at that rate, there would be in three hundred <hi>Apples,</hi> twelve <hi>Summer-Calvills,</hi> and twelve <hi>Rambours,</hi> with fourty three <hi>Gray-pippins,</hi> fourty three <hi>White pippins,</hi> fourty three <hi>Autumn-Calvills,</hi> fourty three <hi>Apis,</hi> thirty two <hi>Fennellets,</hi> thirty two <hi>Cour-pendu's,</hi> and thirty two <hi>Violet-apples,</hi> and Å¿o forwards in greater numbers of each Å¿ort, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Å¿ame Proportion.</p>

                        <p>There remains but one difficulty more to clear, which is to direct what is to be done <note place="margin">What Å¿orts of <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> and in what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is beÅ¿t to plant in little Gardens.</note> in very little <hi>Gardens,</hi> in which I freely counÅ¿el that Å¿ome little <hi>Apple-trees</hi> be planted; there needs but a very little room to place half a dozen, or a whole dozen of them, without Å¿o much as the Company of any <hi>Pear-trees</hi> among them, and without harming any of the little <hi>Plants</hi> we have a mind Å¿hould grow under them.

As for thoÅ¿e that have four Walls, they are of a Square Figure, which is the commoneÅ¿t as well as the faireÅ¿t and moÅ¿t convenient. There are Å¿ome indeed, as I have Å¿aid elÅ¿ewhere, that are <hi>Pentagonal</hi> and <hi>Hexagonal,</hi> &amp;c. which are not very diÅ¿agreeable for the planting of <hi>Wall-trees.</hi> But I make no great account of them, becauÅ¿e they are attended with many inconveniences, and perplex Gardeners, who are thereby hindred from forming any fair and Å¿ightly Squares in their <hi>Kitchen Gardens,</hi> which conÅ¿equently makes me have little Stomach to Å¿peak any thing in their favour; and beÅ¿ides, it coÅ¿ts a great deal more to make <hi>Gardens</hi> of thoÅ¿e unuÅ¿ual Figures, than to make them Å¿imply and plainly Å¿quare; and yet when all's done, though Å¿uch Figures may have more Walls, yet they can have no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> than a plain Å¿quare, for let us do the beÅ¿t we can, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible by any variation of Figure that can be invented, to produce any more than four of them, <note place="margin">The number of <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> and that it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed four.</note> that is to Å¿ay, the <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> of the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> and of the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North.</hi> This is a truth that needs no proof, Å¿ince no Body can call it into Doubt.</p>
                        <p>Now in Terms of Gardening, we call <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> every Wall that enjoys the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect and kindly reflection of the Rays of the Sun during a certain time of the Day, in <note place="margin">What is meant by <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions.</hi>
                           </note> a different manner from another Wall not in the Å¿ame poÅ¿ition. Thus we call an <hi>EaÅ¿ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> a Wall that is eyed by the Sun the firÅ¿t half of the Day; that is to Å¿ay, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The four</hi> ExpoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, EaÅ¿terly, VVeÅ¿terly. Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>and</hi> Southerly, <hi>defined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</hi>
                           </note> from its RiÅ¿ing till Noon, at what hour Å¿oever it begins to riÅ¿e; and that a <hi>WeÅ¿terly ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> which is Å¿hone upon the Å¿econd half of the Day; that is to Å¿ay, which begins to be Å¿hone upon immediately after Noon, and continues to be Å¿o till Sun-Å¿etting. And we Å¿tyle that a <hi>Southerly ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> which beginning in Summer time, to enjoy the comfortable Å¿miles of the Sun, Å¿oon after his riÅ¿ing is not totally deprived of them till he be almoÅ¿t ready to diÅ¿appear from among us, or perhaps not till he be actually out of Å¿ight, or to Å¿peak more generally, we call that a <hi>Southern ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> that is it Å¿elf alone conÅ¿tantly Å¿hone upon longer than either of the two former taken Å¿eparately, and there are Å¿ome Gardens Å¿o advantageouÅ¿ly turned, that one of their Walls is almoÅ¿t the whole day cheriÅ¿hed by the Sun-Beams.</p>
                        <p>I expreÅ¿s in the TreatiÅ¿e of Plantations, what Å¿orts of ExpoÅ¿itions I affect moÅ¿t, and counÅ¿el others to affect too, that have as we Å¿ay, a whole piece of Cloath to cut out as they liÅ¿t, in order to the contriving themÅ¿elves both a fair and good Garden, which is a HappineÅ¿s, not very ordinarily to be met with, eÅ¿pecially in great Cities, where Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are under a thouÅ¿and Subjections to their HouÅ¿es, for which their Gardens are made, and to which they muÅ¿t be accommodated, and conÅ¿equently are Å¿uch Subjections from which they can hardly ever exempt themÅ¿elves.</p>
                        <p>After all we have Å¿aid about the three good <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> it is no hard matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the unhappy <hi>Northerly ExpoÅ¿ition</hi> is that which enjoys the Sun, only during that little time in which the <hi>Southerly</hi> one has him not; for the Sun cannot Å¿hine upon two Walls directly oppoÅ¿ite one to the other, at the Å¿ame time. The Portion of thoÅ¿e of the <hi>North,</hi> then, is to enjoy from the <hi>Equinox</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to that of <hi>September,</hi> the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieÅ¿t Rays of the Sun that appear above our <hi>Horizon;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, to be Å¿hone upon betimes in the Morning, and that Å¿ometimes for an hour or two, and Å¿ometimes for three or four, but Å¿ometimes they run the danger of having but a very Å¿hort view of him towards Evening; nay and very often, of having none at all.</p>
                        <p>It follows from this Explication of <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> that there is no Wall that has not as leaÅ¿t Å¿ome little glance of the Sun once a day, and that is a favour always to be counted for Å¿omething.</p>
                        <p>And this, if I miÅ¿take not, is the proper place in which I ought to tell you, that the Sun never begins to Å¿hine upon one Wall, but he Å¿hines upon two at the Å¿ame time, and <note place="margin">The Sun always Å¿hines upon two Walls at once and how.</note> they are thoÅ¿e that concurr to make the common Angle in which the two joyn that are Å¿o Å¿hone upon; thus when he riÅ¿es, he ordinarily Å¿hines at once upon the <hi>Northern</hi> Wall, and part of the <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> one, and as Å¿oon as ever the progreÅ¿s of his CourÅ¿e, carries him out of the Å¿ight of that of the <hi>North,</hi> He inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly extends his Beams to that of the <hi>South,</hi> yet Å¿o as not for a good while after to quit that of the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> but Å¿hining upon both at once; in the Å¿ame manner alÅ¿o he leaves not off Å¿hining on the <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> Wall, but in order to advance himÅ¿elf by little and little to the <hi>WeÅ¿tern ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> and to continue in the mean while his favourable AÅ¿pect to the <hi>Southerly</hi> Wall, Å¿o that thoÅ¿e two Walls are likewiÅ¿e at the Å¿ame time gratified with his cheering Rays.</p>

                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48210:95"/>
And thus every day begins and ends that glorious progreÅ¿s and courÅ¿e of the Sun, which cauÅ¿es the fertility of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the goodneÅ¿s of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the Joy and PleaÅ¿ure of Mankind: But he finiÅ¿hes it not however, without Å¿cattering Å¿ome Å¿mall Remains of his laÅ¿t Melancholy and Expiring Splendour upon the poor <hi>Northern</hi> Wall, he gives it a Å¿light viÅ¿it in paÅ¿Å¿ing, that is to Å¿ay properly, he only glances lightly by it when he is got beyond the reach of its <hi>Southern</hi> OppoÅ¿ite. Any two Walls that are diametrically oppoÅ¿ite one to the other, are never Å¿hone upon at the Å¿ame time, unleÅ¿s it be juÅ¿t in the moment the Sun is paÅ¿Å¿ing from one to the other; for then that great Torch <note place="margin">When the Sun Å¿eems to Å¿tand, and Å¿hines a Å¿mall moment upon the three Walls at once.</note> which is always advancing with an unconceivable Rapidity, appears as if he were for Å¿ome time Å¿topt, and Å¿ixt, though he really be not, and then he may be truly Å¿aid to view three different <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> at the Å¿ame time; but that being only juÅ¿t as he is going to quit the Å¿ight of that of the three, which he had thitherto continued the longeÅ¿t looks towards, and beginning to turn his Countenance towards the other, which is directly oppoÅ¿ite to it, cannot be of any long duration. Upon which, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any tall <hi>Trees</hi> nor high Walls, nor neighbouring HouÅ¿es that may obÅ¿truct the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the Sun's light upon any of the <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> we are examining, otherwiÅ¿e we Å¿hall never be able to lay down any thing poÅ¿itive for the inÅ¿tructions we intend to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>After having thus explained what we mean in terms of <hi>Gardening,</hi> by <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny PerÅ¿on may eaÅ¿ily judge of thoÅ¿e he has in his own <hi>Garden,</hi> whether it be walled quite about, or only in part; as we Å¿ee in thoÅ¿e for Example, that are cloÅ¿ed on Å¿ome Å¿ides only with Rivers, Ditches, or quick Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But though I were informed of the extent of the Å¿urface of every <hi>Garden,</hi> that would not enable me to calculate any thing near what extent of walling it will take up. For Example, though an <hi>Arpent</hi> or <hi>Acre</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> MeaÅ¿ure, contains nine hundred ToiÅ¿es or Fathoms of <hi>Superficies,</hi> yet it may be, that this <hi>Superficies</hi> may be reduced to a perfect <note place="margin">What is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and content of an <hi>Arpent,</hi> or <hi>Paris Acre.</hi>
                           </note> Square of thirty ToiÅ¿es or Fathoms every way, and Å¿o Å¿uch an <hi>Arpent</hi> or <hi>Acre</hi> will contain but one hundred and twenty Fathoms in CompaÅ¿s, that is to Å¿ay, Å¿ixty Yards for each of the four <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> which is as little Walling as a <hi>Paris Acre</hi> of <hi>Ground</hi> can have.</p>
                        <p>Some Å¿uch <hi>Acres</hi> may alÅ¿o have one hundred and thirty, one hundred and fifty, two hundred, two hundred and eighteen, and Å¿ometimes as many as three hundred and <note place="margin">What quantity of compaÅ¿s Å¿uch an <hi>Acre</hi> or <hi>Arpent</hi> may have, and what Walling it may require in Å¿everal Å¿orts of Figures, as a perfect Squaes. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> twelve Fathoms Circumference, and more; which will happen, if in the firÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion there be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed two large Å¿ides of forty five Fathoms each, and two leÅ¿Å¿er ones each of twenty; if in the Å¿econd there be two long Å¿ides of Å¿ixty, and two Å¿horter ones of fifteen Fathoms each; if in the third there be two long Å¿ides of fourÅ¿core and ten, and two Å¿horter ones of ten Fathoms each; if in the Fourth, Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be a Triangular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloÅ¿ure, there be two Å¿ides of one hundred Fathoms each, and a Å¿hort one of eighteen. And laÅ¿tly, if in the fifth, this <hi>Acre</hi> have two long Å¿ides of a hundred and fifty Fathoms each, and two Å¿hort ones of Six Fathoms each, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which indeed would make a very odd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited <hi>Garden,</hi> and one ridiculous enough. But however Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e may poÅ¿Å¿ibly happen.</p>
                        <p>After all, I can truly Å¿ay, that I cannot exactly calculate what quantity of Walling every piece of <hi>Ground</hi> will require for its entire encloÅ¿ure, Å¿ince as I have juÅ¿t now Å¿hewed you, one and the Å¿ame quantity of Superficies may have a great deal more, or a great deal leÅ¿s, according to the greater or leÅ¿Å¿er length of the Å¿ides of the Å¿aid Land.</p>
                        <p>In fine, it is pleaÅ¿ant enough to Å¿ee, that if a Square have two hundred Fathoms of <note place="margin">A pretty Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿ubincloÅ¿ures made out of greater ones.</note> Walling in its Circumference, and we be minded to make a Å¿eparate incloÅ¿ure of the quarter, or of the half of the Å¿aid Å¿quare, that quarter will take up one hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, which is the half of the whole, and that half will take up one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, three quarters of the whole; <hi>Geometry</hi> Å¿atisfies us with good ReaÅ¿ons for all thoÅ¿e differences, which belonging not to my Å¿ubject, I omit.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I Å¿hall not define what Circumference a Garden may have, nor what <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions,</hi> becauÅ¿e I cannot, but Å¿hall only tell you how many <hi>Trees</hi> each <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition</hi> may <note place="margin">The number and diÅ¿tances of <hi>Trees</hi> to be ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different height of the Walls, or quality of the <hi>Ground.</hi>

The contrary is likewiÅ¿e true in reÅ¿pect of Walls that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48210:96"/>
are low, always conÅ¿idering withal, the quality of the Soil; that is to Å¿ay, the lower the Walls, Å¿o much the further the <hi>Trees</hi> are to be placed one from another, and thoÅ¿e very diÅ¿tances muÅ¿t Å¿till be more enlarged when the ground is very rich, than when it is but indifferently qualified.</p>
                        <p>And here it is needful to explain and make you underÅ¿tand the following Truth which <note place="margin">A Difficulty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of <hi>wall-trees.</hi> In what caÅ¿e, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in good Soils, they are to be placed nearer one another, than otherwiÅ¿e.</note> Å¿eems a little Paradoxical: Our deÅ¿ign in Planting <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> is indeed to have Å¿o much the fairer Fruit, but Å¿till more chiefly, to Å¿ecure the greater Å¿tore of it; but <hi>Trees</hi> do not infallibly yield Fruit, unleÅ¿s it be upon feeble Branches, and therefore we Å¿hall have no Fruit upon our <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> unleÅ¿s we contrive it Å¿o, that we may have Å¿ome feeble Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on them: And if the <hi>Trees</hi> he very vigorous, as they are commonly in good Soils, they cannot produce any feeble Branches, unleÅ¿s they be allowed a great deal of room to Å¿pread out to the beÅ¿t advantage all thoÅ¿e that are fit to bear; becauÅ¿e, that Å¿uppoÅ¿ing they be Planted too near one another, and the <hi>Walls</hi> be not high enough, they muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be Pruned very Å¿hort, or elÅ¿e they will Å¿hoot above the <hi>Wall,</hi> and conÅ¿equently ceaÅ¿e to be <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> or elÅ¿e they will Å¿o intangle their Branches one with another, that they will make a very diÅ¿agreeable confuÅ¿ion, and Å¿uch a one as will prove as prejudicial to the Fruit, as if they had been cut too Å¿hort.</p>
                        <p>If then they be Curbed in that manner; that is to Å¿ay, if we leave them not Branches of Å¿ome reaÅ¿onable thickneÅ¿s and length, all the young Å¿hoots they will produce will be always thick, and thick ones bear no Fruit, and conÅ¿equently good <hi>Trees</hi> Planted near one another in a good ground will bear no Fruit, and all through the Gard'ner's fault: And therefore it follows by an undoubted conÅ¿equence, that in good Soils, whoÅ¿e <hi>Walls</hi> are but low, we ought to allow very conÅ¿iderable diÅ¿tances between <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Tree,</hi> if we would pretend any Å¿tore of fair Fruit from them; and that when the <hi>Walls</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we may and ought to place the <hi>Trees</hi> nearer one another, as I have already Å¿hewed; now I Å¿hall proceed to tell you what is my Advice concerning the MeaÅ¿ure and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoÅ¿e DiÅ¿tances.</p>
                        <p>My Judgment is, that no <hi>Walls</hi> of incloÅ¿ure ought to be made leÅ¿s than Seven or <note place="margin">Of what height Walls ought to be, and the Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral allowable proportions of that height, <hi>viz.</hi> never to be leÅ¿s than 7 or 8, and never more than 15 or 16 Foot.</note> Eight Foot high, as well for the better Å¿ecurity againÅ¿t Robbing and Spoiling to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from abroad, as for the advancing and improving the goodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> I likewiÅ¿e am of Opinion, that in the good <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> it is not convenient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire <hi>Walls</hi> of above Fifteen or Sixteen Foot; for as for thoÅ¿e of the <hi>North,</hi> which we call bad ones, the higheÅ¿t <hi>Walls</hi> are ordinarily the worÅ¿t, for they caÅ¿t long Å¿hadows of pernicious influence to Gardens, but yet we Å¿hall endeavour to make a good uÅ¿e of them, and eÅ¿pecially in Soils a little dry, and in pretty hot Climates.</p>
                        <p>By all I have newly Å¿aid about the heighth of <hi>Walls,</hi> it appears, that I have little <note place="margin">Leaning Walls not proper.</note> value for thoÅ¿e <hi>Leaning-Walls</hi> to pretend to make them <hi>Fruit-Walls</hi> for <hi>Pears, Peaches, Apricocks,</hi> &amp;c. but they may Å¿erve for Å¿omething elÅ¿e, as I Å¿hall Å¿hew afterwards: It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e appears, I do not much approve the extraordinary heighths of Å¿ome topping <hi>Walls</hi> of HouÅ¿es, or of Churches, though I make uÅ¿e of them very advantageouÅ¿ly when I meet with any of them expoÅ¿ed to the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> or <hi>South;</hi> and that is, particularly to raiÅ¿e <hi>Figs</hi> againÅ¿t them, which as they love nothing Å¿o much as heat and Å¿helter, Å¿o they apprehend nothing Å¿o much as the Cold Winds and <hi>ScabbineÅ¿s;</hi> and <hi>High Walls</hi> are very proper, as well to do them all the good they need, as to defend them from the MiÅ¿chiefs which attack them.</p>
                        <p>When I here Å¿o much extoll the Conveniences of the <hi>High Walls</hi> of the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Quarters, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e it to be in Climates where the Heat is but Å¿mall, or at leaÅ¿t ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate; for in thoÅ¿e which are hot and burning, as thoÅ¿e of our <hi>Provence,</hi> and of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> or that exceed them Å¿till in heat, as thoÅ¿e Countries that lie nearer the <hi>Line,</hi> in thoÅ¿e Climates, Å¿uch <hi>Walls</hi> are as formidable and pernicious to Fruits which do but broil and cleave or chap againÅ¿t them, and to <hi>Trees</hi> which they dry up, and kill, as the <hi>Northern Walls</hi> are uneaÅ¿ie, and contrary to the ripening of Fruits in other places that offend in want of Heat, and exceÅ¿s of MoiÅ¿ture.</p>

The chief Rules for diÅ¿tances ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the height of the <hi>walls,</hi> and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soil. Rules for the firÅ¿t Å¿ize of <hi>walls</hi> of Seven or Eight Foot high. The diÅ¿tance.</note> 
                           <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> One, for thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> that commonly take up more room, which Å¿hall be the FirÅ¿t <hi>ClaÅ¿s;</hi> and another, for thoÅ¿e that take up leÅ¿s, and that Å¿hall be the Second. The FirÅ¿t <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> comprehends <hi>Figs, Peaches, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Apricocks;</hi> the Second compriÅ¿es <hi>Pears, HaÅ¿ty,</hi> or <hi>Forward-Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Azerolls,</hi> or <hi>Garden-Haws:</hi> Which Two <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> muÅ¿t be well obÅ¿erved, for the full underÅ¿tanding of my DiÅ¿tinctions.</p>
                        <p>Now, as we have already Å¿aid, the principal things that muÅ¿t Regulate all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances, muÅ¿t be the greater or leÅ¿Å¿er heighth of the <hi>Walls,</hi> or greater or leÅ¿Å¿er good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Soil. And accordingly, my CuÅ¿tom is to order them in this following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conformably to my aboveÅ¿aid Å¿uppoÅ¿ition of Two <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AgainÅ¿t <hi>Walls</hi> that are about Seven or Eight Foot high, or a little more, if the Ground be good, and the Soil freÅ¿h and hearty, as it is in many places, I place the <hi>Trees</hi> of the FirÅ¿t <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> at Twelve Foot diÅ¿tance one from the other, and thoÅ¿e of the Second, at Nine; but if the Soil be but indifferently qualified, I place the FirÅ¿t at Eight or Nine; and the Second, at Seven or Eight Foot diÅ¿tance.</p>
                        <p>The diÅ¿tance of Twelve Foot Å¿urpriÅ¿es a Gentleman raw and unexperienced in theÅ¿e <note place="margin">ReaÅ¿ons for the diÅ¿tance of 12 Foot Å¿ometimes in Plantations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againÅ¿t Å¿uch <hi>walls.</hi>
                           </note> CurioÅ¿ities, who has not many <hi>Walls</hi> to fill up; for example, a Gentleman that has but ThreeÅ¿core or FourÅ¿core Yards of Walling, when he Å¿ees himÅ¿elf confined to Plant but Fifteen or Twenty <hi>Trees</hi> againÅ¿t it, he is apt to fear two things, the firÅ¿t is, that he Å¿hall hardly ever Å¿ee his <hi>Walls</hi> well garniÅ¿h'd; and the Å¿econd, that he Å¿hall as hardly ever <note place="margin">Objected Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Fears AnÅ¿wered and Remedied.</note> have much Fruit: But beÅ¿ides the inconveniences, which, as I have Å¿hewn, ariÅ¿e from Planting <hi>Trees</hi> too near one another, as well in regard of the BarrenneÅ¿s it cauÅ¿es in them, as of the greater trouble it gives for their Cultivation; I Å¿ay, beÅ¿ides this, firÅ¿t, we may confidently expect, that <hi>Trees</hi> Planted in a good Soil, will be brisk, and eaÅ¿ily Å¿hoot forth every Year Å¿everal young Branches of Four or Five Foot long apiece; and that Å¿o, according to that rate, being Planted in Å¿uch a Soil, and againÅ¿t <hi>Walls</hi> but of a Å¿mall heighth, and at Twelve Foot diÅ¿tance one from another, which by conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence makes round about them, about Six Foot for each <hi>Tree</hi> to GarniÅ¿h as well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as on each Å¿ide of them, Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> I Å¿ay will certainly in few Years come near one another, and therefore will not leave the Å¿paces between them long void: And Å¿o this will be a Å¿peedy Remedy againÅ¿t the Gentleman's firÅ¿t fear.</p>
                        <p>To Remedy the Second, He may venture to plant double the number of <hi>Trees</hi> I have before limitted, if he like to be at that Charge, notwithÅ¿tanding my aboveÅ¿aid advice which is againÅ¿t it, and Å¿o place them at the diÅ¿tances of Six Foot, to pleaÅ¿e his Eye with Å¿eeing his Wall Å¿o much the Å¿ooner garniÅ¿hed, but then it muÅ¿t be upon condition, that at the end of Three or Four Years, when thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿hall be in a condition to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to act their parts well in bearing Fruit, to recompenÅ¿e by that means the nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have conÅ¿umed, and the pains they have coÅ¿t; I Å¿ay, it muÅ¿t be upon this condition, that the Gentleman be of a temper at the expiration of that time, to be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Å¿ecuring the flouriÅ¿hing condition of the reÅ¿t, to Å¿acrifice the Å¿uperfluous half, by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48210:97"/>
plucking them up by the Roots, and throwing them into the Fire, and afterwards put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting freÅ¿h Molds about thoÅ¿e left to grow, inÅ¿tead of the old Earth which the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate condemned <hi>Trees</hi> have Å¿o unuÅ¿efully exhauÅ¿ted: For he muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily proceed to that extremity with them, or elÅ¿e he muÅ¿t lay aÅ¿ide all hopes of Fruit. And methinks people are but too apt to make uÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t expedient when they begin their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and in earneÅ¿t, it is that which moÅ¿t of any thing tickles the Fancy of thoÅ¿e that are apt to reckon upon their Å¿tore of Fruit from the number of their <hi>Trees,</hi> but we find few that can find in their hearts to proceed to the Execution of the Second, when the time that requires it is come, and Å¿o by that imprudent and unÅ¿eaÅ¿onable pity, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly fall into thoÅ¿e Inconveniences which I have mentioned; Å¿o that the Å¿ureÅ¿t way is, not to be at any Å¿uch unprofitable Expences, nor to give our Å¿elves Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions to have thoÅ¿e Combats afterwards within our Å¿elves; and therefore I CounÅ¿el Gentlemen rather to follow the Advice I propoÅ¿e in obÅ¿erving the diÅ¿tances I preÅ¿cribe between <hi>Trees</hi> to be planted in Å¿pecial good Soils.</p>
                        <p>Let us now proceed to planting our <hi>Trees</hi> by <hi>Walls</hi> of Nine Foot high, or more, and <note place="margin">Rules for <hi>walls</hi> of between Nine and Eleven Foot.</note> let us tell you, That if the ground be good, as I have before Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, then the diÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Trees</hi> of the firÅ¿t <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> Å¿hall be proportioned at Nine or Ten Foot, and thoÅ¿e of the Å¿econd, at Seven or Eight; but if the ground be not very good, Eight Foot will Å¿uffice for the firÅ¿t, and Seven for the Å¿econd: Where Note by the by, that tho' the difference of a Foot more or leÅ¿s, as well in the heighth of the <hi>Walls,</hi> as the diÅ¿tance of the <hi>Trees,</hi> Å¿eems no great matter, yet is it of very conÅ¿iderable influence for the good or bad Å¿ucceÅ¿s of a <hi>Wall Plantation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Wall</hi> reach the heighth of Eleven or Twelve Foot, or a little more, and the <note place="margin">Rules for <hi>walls</hi> of Eleven or Twelve Foot.</note> ground be full as good as we deÅ¿ire, then I plant the <hi>Trees</hi> half as near again as by the <hi>Walls</hi> above mentioned, taking care all along, that between every Two <hi>Trees</hi> of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stature, which are managed Å¿o as to garniÅ¿h the lower part of the <hi>Wall,</hi> there be one which may Å¿hoot up and garniÅ¿h it above; for which purpoÅ¿e, we may have Å¿ome <hi>Trees</hi> of the true Standard-kind, which prove very uÅ¿eful, eÅ¿pecially for <hi>Pear-Trees, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Trees, Apricock-Trees,</hi> and even for <hi>Peach</hi> and <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> too, tho' for theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t, we may do well enough without them, becauÅ¿e they are <hi>Trees</hi> that commonly in little time put forth Å¿hoots big enough to form very fine Stemms or Bodies, and conÅ¿equently fit to mount up and garniÅ¿h the upper part of our <hi>Walls.</hi> In Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e then, where the <hi>Walls</hi> are very high, I add as many <hi>Trees</hi> more; and for that reaÅ¿on, if the Soil be good, place them at about Six Foot diÅ¿tance one from another; and if it be but indifferently qualified, I reduce their diÅ¿tances to Four or Five Foot, making my account, that by this means, the head of each of thoÅ¿e taller <hi>Trees</hi> will garniÅ¿h about Five or Six Foot of the <hi>Wall</hi> on each Å¿ide of them, which it will eaÅ¿ily do, provided that at the end of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Eight Years, if we perceive their vigour flag, care be taken to put a little freÅ¿h Mold between every Couple of <hi>Trees,</hi> to reÅ¿tore it, and to repair that heart in the ground which Å¿o many Roots may have exhauÅ¿ted, or brought low; but Å¿o long as we perceive no change in the <hi>Trees</hi> to the WorÅ¿e, we need not trouble our Å¿elves to do any thing to the Earth.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hall AdvertiÅ¿e you by the way, that one of the things that moÅ¿t diÅ¿pleaÅ¿es me in <hi>Wall-Plantations,</hi> is, to Å¿ee <hi>Vines, Figs, Stone Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Kernel Fruit,</hi> interlaced Pell-mell one among another againÅ¿t one <hi>Wall;</hi> I thinking it much more convenient to place eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kind in a Å¿eparate quarter by themÅ¿elves; Å¿o as for Example, one good <hi>Wall</hi> might be only for <hi>Figs,</hi> and another for <hi>Peaches, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> the mixture of which, I do not much condemn, becauÅ¿e that the <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> being more Å¿ubject to periÅ¿h and die, in whole, or in part, either by Accident, or by Age, than thoÅ¿e other Fruits, there may always remain in our <hi>Wall-Plantation</hi> Å¿ome other <hi>Trees</hi> to keep up its Beauty in caÅ¿e of any Mortality hapning to the <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> another end of a <hi>Wall</hi> Å¿hould be for <hi>Pear-Trees;</hi> which as near as 'twere poÅ¿Å¿ible, I would by no means mix with the <hi>Peach-Trees:</hi> In fine, another part of this <hi>Plantation</hi> Å¿hould be for the <hi>Early,</hi> or <hi>HaÅ¿ting-Cherries,</hi> and another for the <hi>Grapes,</hi> which laÅ¿t I would have alÅ¿o Å¿eparated into Å¿everal quarters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different Å¿orts, without confounding together the <hi>MuÅ¿cats,</hi> or <hi>Musk,</hi> or <hi>MuÅ¿ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine-Grapes,</hi> with the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elas, Corinthians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes indeed I chance to place Å¿ome Plants of <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elas-Grapes</hi> among other Fruits, but that never happens, but when 'tis to garniÅ¿h Å¿ome part of a <hi>Wall</hi> that is extreamly high, with deÅ¿ign to have Å¿ome Å¿tock of it Å¿hoot Å¿trait up to a certain heighth, to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruit can Å¿eldom ever reach, which is not ordinary; nay, I care not to uÅ¿e my dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Grapes</hi> in that Service, becauÅ¿e they ripen not Å¿o well when raiÅ¿ed upon high Trails, as <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elas</hi> do.</p>

of Å¿ituation, a degree of GoodneÅ¿s, which the violent ardour of the Sun reflected againÅ¿t a Wall, could never be able to give them equally on all parts of their Circference. The experience we have of theÅ¿e Å¿ingular good effects of the full Air, has made me to think of raiÅ¿ing a kind of cavelling objection againÅ¿t Wall-Plantations; for though I know indeed for certain, that 'tis they that contribute to the inÅ¿uring us a crop of Fruit, yet I know as certainly at the Å¿ame time, that 'tis they that by cramping up our Fruits againÅ¿t a Wall, and thereby depriving them of the free enjoyment of the Air, hinder them from acquiring the full GoodneÅ¿s they naturally would have, as if thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> out of a SenÅ¿e of impatience and indignation at the violence and torture they Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by being Å¿o tyed and crampt up, had a mind to puniÅ¿h us by a Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ome part of their GoodneÅ¿s, for the injury we do them in robbing them of that liberty which Nature had bleÅ¿t them withal.</p>
                        <p>In the Spring time then, I take advantage of the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Wall, to make <note place="margin">How to draw out the bearing Branches to give the Fruit the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the open Air till they are ripe.</note> the Peaches knit, and take the more Å¿urely, and at MidÅ¿ummer I draw the Branches with Fruit on them forwards from the Wall, which after my manner of Pruning, I leave long, and with Props which I Å¿ix deep in the <hi>Earth,</hi> I Å¿upport and keep tight and firm thoÅ¿e Branches Å¿o laden with their Fruit, which by that Artifice, acquires that goodneÅ¿s which the open Air only can give it, and which we have newly deÅ¿cribed.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, there is Å¿ome Subjection and Pains required to do this well, and the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and beauty of our Wall-Plantation is thereby a little disfigured whilÅ¿t the Fruit is on the <hi>Trees,</hi> Å¿o that the Eyes of all PerÅ¿ons that look upon it, are not Å¿o well pleaÅ¿ed as <note place="margin">The effect of that Method.</note> otherwiÅ¿e, but that fault is amply recompenÅ¿ed, as well by the beauty of the colour, and the Å¿moothneÅ¿s of the Skin, as by that rich taÅ¿te in the Fruit, which cannot be had otherwiÅ¿e. And as Å¿oon as the Fruit is gathered, the Branches are put back again to the Wall, and faÅ¿tned in the Å¿ame places they were in before, Å¿o that no Body can Å¿ee they have been ever medled with. I could not forbear mentioning here this Fancy I have had for Branches Å¿o drawn forward.</p>
                        <p>It is certain then, that almoÅ¿t all Å¿orts of <hi>Peaches</hi> placed in the full Air, in Å¿uch kind of high fenced City <hi>Gardens,</hi> as we have mentioned, Å¿o luckily hit to produce Å¿uch rare and delicious Fruit, that one would think it grew in Å¿ome enchanted place, rather than in a <hi>Garden</hi> cultivated by human Art.

                        <p>But to return to the purÅ¿uit of the ConteÅ¿tation of Fruits, concerning the point of Precedence in Wall-Plantations.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe any Body would offer to put up <hi>Pears</hi> here to pretend to Precedence in the good places in diÅ¿pute, to the prejudice of the <hi>MuÅ¿cat-grapes, Peaches, Figgs,</hi> &amp;c. (whatever merits <hi>Pears</hi> may otherwiÅ¿e have, and which we readily acknowledge in them, and particularly in the Boncretiens that are fair, large, long, and coloured with a lovely red) for we have other Fruits that undoubtedly far excell them, much leÅ¿s Å¿till will any pretend to propoÅ¿e in this DiÅ¿pute, either <hi>Apricocks,</hi> or <hi>Early Cherries,</hi> or <hi>Azerolls</hi> or <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Haws.</hi> They would have the diÅ¿grace of a repulÅ¿e, if they Å¿hould engage them in it, but we Å¿hall do all of them that honour which is their due, when their turn comes, Å¿o that their Protectors, if there Å¿hould appear any to put in any Å¿uch claim for them, Å¿hall have no reaÅ¿on to be diÅ¿content.</p>
                        <p>There are few perÅ¿ons that have yet thought of declaring in favour of good <hi>Plums</hi> in this ConteÅ¿tation, I do not Å¿ay all Å¿orts of <hi>Plums,</hi> but only four or five of the beÅ¿t Å¿orts, <note place="margin">The Authours Plea for, and Commendation of Choice <hi>Plums.</hi>
                           </note> and that may perhaps be, becauÅ¿e they have not yet proved with what incomparable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, what exquiÅ¿ite taÅ¿te, and what Å¿ugred Å¿weetneÅ¿s <hi>Wall-Plums</hi> are enriched, not only in compariÅ¿on of thoÅ¿e of their own Kind, that grow in the open Air, but even of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits; a difference very Å¿urprizing in it Å¿elf, but Å¿till more when we conÅ¿ider how difficult it is to render a good reaÅ¿on, why a Wall Å¿hould produce Å¿o contrary an effect <note place="margin">The <hi>wall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a better effect in <hi>Plums</hi> than in other Fruit.</note> in <hi>Plums,</hi> to what it do's in other Fruits, it being very certain, that <hi>Plums</hi> very conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably improve in goodneÅ¿s by the Wall, whereas other Fruits no leÅ¿s conÅ¿iderably impair theirs in the Å¿ame Å¿ituation.</p>

                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48210:99"/>
Perhaps, I would put my Å¿elf willingly at the head of thoÅ¿e Gentlemen that in the preÅ¿ent Competition, would be for giving to the good <hi>Wall-Plums,</hi> the Precedence before all other Fruits.</p>
                        <p>And to make good my CauÅ¿e, I would readily produce a Basket full of good <hi>Violet-Perdigon-Plums</hi> full ripe, and curiouÅ¿ly dewed or flower'd, mixed with Å¿ome white <hi>Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> Å¿ome St. <hi>Catharine Plums,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Apricock-Plums,</hi> being well aÅ¿Å¿ured that the eyes of all the Spectators would be much moved to favour my Plea, by Å¿o lovely a Å¿ight, that their taÅ¿te would almoÅ¿t convince them of its JuÅ¿tice; and in fine, that all that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me a great many Backers, and make my party conÅ¿iderably Å¿trong.</p>

                        <p>A good <hi>Fig</hi> then is that which above all Fruit deÅ¿erves among us the beÅ¿t place in a Wall-Plantation, (though in hot Countries, a Wall might incommode it.)

                        <p>BeÅ¿ides, it has the advantage to bear twice a year, that is to Å¿ay firÅ¿t, in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> which firÅ¿t <hi>Figs</hi> are called <hi>Fig-Flowers;</hi> and the Å¿econd time in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>

                        <p>I might here tell you by the way this truth, that among the Å¿econd ones, thoÅ¿e which ripen in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> before there come any FroÅ¿t, have in my Opinion, <note place="margin">The latter <hi>Figs</hi> beÅ¿t, and why.</note> both a more Å¿ugred pulp, and a richer taÅ¿te, and conÅ¿equently are better, though a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leÅ¿Å¿er than the firÅ¿t, the reaÅ¿on of which is palpable enough, it being becauÅ¿e the <hi>September Figs</hi> were formed in the faireÅ¿t SeaÅ¿on of the Year, and nouriÅ¿hed with a juice well concocted, and wrought up to a great Perfection; whereas the <hi>Fig-Flowers</hi> have had all the cold, and all the Rain of the Spring-time to weather, and go through; which are two no very favourable CircumÅ¿tances to any Fruits, for their acquiring a Å¿ugred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and exquiÅ¿ite taÅ¿te.</p>
                        <p>I know Å¿everal Å¿orts of <hi>Figs</hi> that probably are all good in hot Countries, becauÅ¿e they all ripen there, but we in this Country have but two Å¿orts, which may properly be Å¿aid to <note place="margin">But two Å¿orts of <hi>Figs</hi> excellent in <hi>France,</hi> viz. the <hi>great round,</hi> and <hi>great long white Figs.</hi> The <hi>long</hi> beÅ¿t, and why.</note> be admirable, and they are the <hi>Great White ones,</hi> of which Å¿ome are <hi>Round,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Long.</hi> The <hi>Round</hi> ones come in more abundance, and the <hi>Long</hi> ones are eÅ¿pecially moÅ¿t admirable about the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they can attain to their due RipeneÅ¿s, becauÅ¿e they are not Å¿o Å¿ubject to Å¿plit and chap towards their Crown, as the <hi>Round</hi> ones are: Which fault ordinarily proceeds from Å¿ome hot Rains that fall in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> that make thoÅ¿e poor <hi>Round Figs</hi> Å¿o Å¿well, that they gape towards the head, with Clefts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fright one, and thereby vent and let out all their Å¿weetneÅ¿s and perfume; Å¿o that the <hi>Long</hi> ones which are of better proof againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e Rains than the <hi>Round</hi> ones, have in truth at that time a moÅ¿t ExquiÅ¿ite and Miraculous TaÅ¿t, which the others have quite loÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>I have had againÅ¿t one <hi>Southern-Fruit-Wall,</hi> Twelve or Fifteen Å¿orts of <hi>Figs,</hi> all of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, to convince me that in this Country we ought aÅ¿Å¿uredly to keep only to the <note place="margin">Compared with other <hi>Figs.</hi>

above mentioned; perhaps the race of them may be kept Å¿till in <hi>PerÅ¿ia,</hi> from whence they pretend all <hi>Peaches</hi> firÅ¿t came, yet without bringing along with them that mortal quality Å¿ome would make us believe they have there, or if they will needs have the <hi>Pavies</hi> to have all come out of that Country, thoÅ¿e which we have not here, muÅ¿t with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt have been drowned in the long Seas by the way. I am particularly Å¿orry for thoÅ¿e that would have been extream forward to ripen in our Climates, we Å¿hould be very happy if we could repair the loÅ¿s of them, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing that ever any Å¿uch loÅ¿s we had.</p>
                        <p>I know well enough too, there are Å¿ome curious PerÅ¿ons, that reckon up more Å¿orts <note place="margin">The vanity of Å¿ome People of multiplying Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies without Grounds.</note> of Stone Fruits than we have counted above; I am willing to grant, they may know Å¿ome that I know not; but at leaÅ¿t, let them be pleaÅ¿ed to let me tell them, that after a very great and very long continued exactneÅ¿s in Å¿earching, I never could find any more, and I will add, that as great a Liberty has been taken in multiplying the names of <hi>Peaches,</hi> as well as thoÅ¿e of other Fruits, and that the leaÅ¿t difference, either in Flower and Colour, or in bigneÅ¿s and Å¿hape, or in the time of their ripeneÅ¿s, or in the taÅ¿te and delicacy of their Juyce, has always given, and Å¿till gives many People an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fancy, to pretend they have Å¿ome new particular Å¿ort of <hi>Peach,</hi> upon which they fail not to Baptize it with a new Name.</p>
                        <p>O unlucky itching humour, which mayÅ¿t properly enough be named, the daughter of Vanity or Ignorance, how great a ConfuÅ¿ion doÅ¿t thou occaÅ¿ion to us among our Fruits! Is it poÅ¿Å¿ible People Å¿hould not know that a difference in <hi>Soils,</hi> in <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> or in <hi>Climates,</hi> or in the tempers of <hi>SeaÅ¿ons,</hi> is able to produce thoÅ¿e little Varieties in Fruits, which yet are not eÅ¿Å¿ential? NotwithÅ¿tanding which, they have given me an infinite deal of Pains to diÅ¿cover the truth. I Å¿hall now with my ordinary Ingenuity, tell you what I think of them, though with the hazard of incurring the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our NurÅ¿ery Mongers.</p>
                        <p>I am very far from deÅ¿iring to Å¿uppreÅ¿s any Å¿ort of good Fruit, Å¿ince in all places as far as my CurioÅ¿ity and Acquaintance extends, I always indefatigably labour to diÅ¿cover Å¿ome new kinds that are good, with deÅ¿ign to multiply and propagate them as Å¿oon as they come to my Knowledge. But likewiÅ¿e on the other Å¿ide, inÅ¿tead of deÅ¿iring to form Chimera's and imaginary and notional beings, though never Å¿o pleaÅ¿ing to the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by multiplying of Names for the leaÅ¿t inconÅ¿iderable differences, I oppoÅ¿e that Å¿pread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e with all the vigour and Å¿incerity I poÅ¿Å¿ibly can; and though I have reckoned up thirty two Å¿orts of <hi>Peaches,</hi> yet I do not therefore Å¿ay, there are thirty two Å¿orts of good ones, Å¿o good as I would deÅ¿ire them, in my <hi>Garden,</hi> or counÅ¿el my Friends to plant them in theirs; no, in that number there are Å¿ome which we may truly pronounce not to be good, and accordingly I Å¿hall baniÅ¿h them, as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible from our Plantations: But likewiÅ¿e, though of any one kind, Å¿ome Å¿hould Å¿ometimes prove bad, we ought not preÅ¿ently to conclude, that the whole kind is therefore bad. Let us now conÅ¿ider ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in what conÅ¿iÅ¿ts the excellency of Å¿ome, and the meanneÅ¿s or badneÅ¿s of Å¿ome others of them, that we may be Å¿o much the better able to judge upon Å¿olid <hi>Grounds,</hi> which are to be received and multiplyed, and which, proÅ¿cribed and entirely debarr'd of all claims to the choice places in our Wall Plantations.</p>

                        <p>THe excellency of <hi>Peaches</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the good qualities they ought naturally to have.</p>
                        <p>Of which the firÅ¿t is, to have their pulp a little firm, Å¿o as it may be juÅ¿t perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">The good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Peaches.</hi> The firÅ¿t good quality.</note> and no more, and very fine withall, which ought to appear when their skin is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, which Å¿hould be fine, Å¿hining and yellow, without any thing of green, and eaÅ¿y to Å¿trip off, which if it do's not, the <hi>Peach</hi> is not ripe. This Excellence further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears when we cut a <hi>Peach</hi> with the Knife, which is, in my Opinion the firÅ¿t thing to be <note place="margin">A remark in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Peach.</hi>
                           </note> done to them at Table, by any one that would eat them delightfully, and with a true reliÅ¿h, and then we may Å¿ee all along where the Knife has paÅ¿t, as 'twere an infinite number of little Springs, which are methinks, the prettieÅ¿t things in the World to look upon. They that open a <hi>Peach</hi> otherwiÅ¿e, oftentimes loÅ¿ing half that delicious Juice that makes them to be Å¿o highly eÅ¿teemed by all the World.</p>

                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48210:101"/>
The Å¿econd good quality of a <hi>Peach</hi> is, that its Pulp melts as Å¿oon as 'tis in the Mouth; <note place="margin">The Å¿econd good quality.</note> for indeed, the pulp of <hi>Peaches</hi> is properly nothing but a congealed water, which diÅ¿Å¿olves into a liquid form, when 'tis never Å¿o little preÅ¿s'd by the Teeth or any thing elÅ¿e. In the third place, that water or juice in melting, ought to be Å¿weet and Å¿ugred, and of a <note place="margin">The third good quality.</note> rich, high, and vinous taÅ¿te, and in Å¿ome kinds of them, a little musked; I would have alÅ¿o their Stone little, and that thoÅ¿e <hi>Peaches</hi> which are not Å¿mooth, be only covered with a reaÅ¿onable proportion of Å¿oft Down, much hairineÅ¿s being a certain mark of the want <note place="margin">The fourth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification.</note> of competent goodneÅ¿s in a <hi>Peach,</hi> that hair uÅ¿ually falling almoÅ¿t quite off, in good <hi>Peaches,</hi> and particularly in thoÅ¿e which grow in the open Air.</p>
                        <p>In fine, I Å¿hould count it one of the principal qualities of a good <hi>Peach</hi> to be large, if we had not Å¿ome little ones that are marvellouÅ¿ly excellent; as for Example, the <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The fifth qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> the <hi>Red Alberges,</hi> and the <hi>Violet-Peaches.</hi> However, it is at leaÅ¿t Å¿o far true, that if the <hi>Peaches</hi> which Å¿hould be large, come Å¿hort of the bigneÅ¿s they Å¿hould have, or much exceed it, they prove always bad; and perhaps it has been pertinently enough Å¿aid by Å¿ome, that theÅ¿e laÅ¿t were <hi>DropÅ¿ical,</hi> and the others <hi>Hectical,</hi> or <hi>ConÅ¿umptive.</hi> The <hi>Hecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ones have much more Stone and leÅ¿s Pulp than they Å¿hould have, and the <hi>DropÅ¿ical</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Two faults in the bigneÅ¿s.

                        <p>And in reality, as I have Å¿aid, there is none but the <hi>Peaches</hi> that grow in the open Air, which have all theÅ¿e good qualities in a Sovereign Degree, with Å¿omething of I know not what exalted taÅ¿te, which 'tis impoÅ¿Å¿ible to deÅ¿cribe.

                        <p>And now it can be no hard matter to judge of good <hi>Peaches,</hi> and amongÅ¿t the good ones, to judge which are the beÅ¿t, no more than to judge which are bad, and among thoÅ¿e bad ones, to judge which are the worÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>It is certain that all the <hi>Peaches</hi> of one certain kind, do not always prove Å¿o perfect as they naturally ought; no, nor all the <hi>Peaches</hi> of the Å¿ame Tree neither, are not of an equal goodneÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>We have already told you that 'tis a great fault in them to be too big or too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; <note place="margin">Seventhly, Another fault to come Å¿hort or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ripeneÅ¿s. How to know when a <hi>Peach</hi> it juÅ¿t ripe, and when too much, or too little.</note> it is likewiÅ¿e one to be either over, or not full ripe; <hi>Peaches</hi> to be juÅ¿t as ripe as they Å¿hould be, and no more, Å¿hould Å¿tick but Å¿lightly to their Stalks; for thoÅ¿e that Å¿tick too faÅ¿t to them, and cannot well be pulled without bringing the Stalk with them, are not ripe enough, and thoÅ¿e that Å¿tick too gingerly on them, or not at all, but are perhaps already Å¿eparated from them of themÅ¿elves, and fallen upon the Ground, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wooden Props Å¿et under them, are too <hi>Ripe,</hi> and are <hi>PaÅ¿t,</hi> as we Å¿ay in terms of Gardening; that is, they are like dead things, and have loÅ¿t all their GoodneÅ¿s.

                        <p>ThoÅ¿e that grow upon <hi>Branches</hi> that are beginning to turn Yellow, and are Sick, <note place="margin">Other faults, to grow on a Å¿ick Branch, or to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen too Å¿oon, or too late.</note> and thoÅ¿e which ripen very long before all the reÅ¿t of the Å¿ame Tree, or a very long time after both the firÅ¿t, and the moÅ¿t that Å¿ucceed them upon the Å¿ame Tree, are Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to prove bad, that is to Å¿ay, to have all the bad qualities we have deÅ¿cribed, or at leaÅ¿t to have a part of them; Å¿o that to meet with a good <hi>Peach</hi> upon a Tree, many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, which I Å¿hall Explain when I come to give Directions how to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them, and how infallibly to know a very good <hi>Peach</hi> from one that is but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

                           <hi>Pavies,</hi> I extremely honour all thoÅ¿e of them which can be brought to ripen well; but that is Å¿omething rare in this Country, unleÅ¿s it be thoÅ¿e called <hi>HaÅ¿tings:</hi> Such curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentlemen as dwell in hot <hi>Climates,</hi> and that are accommodated with Walls well expoÅ¿ed, do very well to plant a great many of them, and are happy enough to Å¿ee them ripen in the open Air, and upon Standard Trees; and then inÅ¿tead of that hard and tough Pulp which they have commonly in this Country, without being accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Sugred Juice of a Vinous, Rich, and perfumed TaÅ¿te, they have a fine and tender Pulp, and almoÅ¿t as melting as our beÅ¿t <hi>Peaches;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, they have a great deal of Juice, and that Juice is Å¿eaÅ¿oned with that agreeable taÅ¿te we deÅ¿ire in them. All theÅ¿e advantages, together with the pleaÅ¿ing view of a Dark Red Colour that

penetrates through their whole SubÅ¿tance, but more towards their Stone, than further from it, allure People to eat of them, and conÅ¿equently begets in their minds an eÅ¿teem for them, and a curioÅ¿ity to plant and rear them.</p>

                        <p>There are two things that Å¿eem to me to be wiÅ¿hed for in <hi>Plums;</hi> FirÅ¿t, that they would come in before the Å¿eaÅ¿on of <hi>Peaches;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> becauÅ¿e then they would be much more advantageous and helpful to us, than by coming as they do almoÅ¿t all in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, together with the <hi>Peaches,</hi> but our wiÅ¿hes in that point are but in vain; however they maintain their <hi>Ground</hi> with them, with Å¿uch marvellous good Grace and Gallantry, that they come off with Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>In were to be wiÅ¿hed in the Å¿econd place, that all the good <hi>Plums</hi> would eleverly quit <note place="margin">MoÅ¿t <hi>Plums</hi> quit not their Stones whether good or bad.</note> their Stones, and yet we muÅ¿t e'en have patience in this CaÅ¿e too, when the <hi>Wall-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigons</hi> though ripe, and at their higheÅ¿t Perfection, yet cleave extream faÅ¿t to their Stones, and the <hi>Roche-Courbons,</hi> which are the Å¿weeteÅ¿t and moÅ¿t Å¿ugred <hi>Plums</hi> we have, will not at all part from them.</p>
                        <p>There are alÅ¿o a great many bad ones that quit not their Stones, as for Example, the <hi>Black-Bull's-Eye,</hi> the <hi>Amber-Plum,</hi> the <hi>Moyeu's,</hi> the <hi>Ilvert,</hi> the St. <hi>Julian,</hi> the <hi>Norbett,</hi> the <hi>CaÅ¿tellan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e that quit them eaÅ¿ilieÅ¿t, are almoÅ¿t all the <hi>Damask-Plums,</hi> of which the number <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Damask Plums</hi> quit their Stoues caÅ¿ilieÅ¿t.</note> is great, or at leaÅ¿t the number of the Names People give them upon the leaÅ¿t little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the World.</p>
                        <p>From all the good qualities of <hi>Plums</hi> that I have above noted, I conclude conformably to my Experience.

As faÅ¿t as I Å¿hall diÅ¿poÅ¿e of each Å¿ort of <hi>Plum,</hi> I will give a little deÅ¿cription of it, as well of thoÅ¿e we Å¿hall plant by <hi>Walls,</hi> as of thoÅ¿e which we Å¿hall rear upon <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Standards.</hi> For in fine, I intend to have of them in all manner of Situations where the <hi>Ground</hi> will permit me, but yet always taking care to place every one of them in that Situation which is moÅ¿t agreeable to them.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing to Å¿ay againÅ¿t the <hi>HaÅ¿ting</hi> or <hi>Early Cherries,</hi> there is but one Å¿ort of them that I know of; It is in the novelty of the Fruit, coming in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> more than in any thing elÅ¿e that their Excellence conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, whether it be to Å¿erve them up raw, or in <hi>Compotes</hi> or wet Sweet-meats; for otherwiÅ¿e to be Å¿owre, to have but little Pulp, a large Stone, and a thick Skin, could certainly be no Qualities to render them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry recommendable: And 'tis this Novelty that will oblige us to plant Å¿ome <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> of them, when we have Walling enough to Å¿pare them.</p>
                        <p>We Å¿hall likewiÅ¿e plant there Å¿ome <hi>Corinthian-Grapes,</hi> which is a Å¿mall berried <hi>Grape,</hi> of a Å¿weet and moÅ¿t delicious juice, of which there are two or three Colours; as alÅ¿o Å¿ome <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elas,</hi> which I prize much in this Country, as well for the Beauty of the <hi>Grape,</hi> and its Berry or Grain, as for the Å¿weetneÅ¿s of its very much Å¿ugred juice, but above all, for its great eaÅ¿ineÅ¿s in being brought to bear, and to ripen, in which they almoÅ¿t never fail us, whereas the <hi>MuÅ¿cat</hi> can hardly ever arrive here to that Point of ripeneÅ¿s, unleÅ¿s it be in Å¿uch another hot and long <hi>Summer,</hi> as was that of the Year 1676.</p>
                        <p>I have little to Å¿ay about <hi>Apricocks;</hi> all the World is well enough acquainted with their TaÅ¿t, Colour, Shape and BigneÅ¿s; and do indeed make Å¿ome account of them, but it <note place="margin">The Authors Å¿enÅ¿e about <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricocks.</hi>
                           </note> is only to make uÅ¿e of in Sweet-meats as well dry as wet, it being not a very delicious Fruit to eat raw in any great quantity; yet in the <hi>Gardens,</hi> in the time of their being ripe, we find PleaÅ¿ure enough in gathering here and there one, to eat upon the Spot.</p>
                        <p>There grow pretty good ones upon great <hi>Standard Trees,</hi> upon which they grow all tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Standard <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks</hi> beÅ¿t.</note> and Å¿peckled with little red Å¿pots that recreate the Sight, and Å¿tir up the Appetite with a much richer and more exquiÅ¿ite taÅ¿t than they have upon <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi> But then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenÅ¿e, <note place="margin">The Wall-ones larger and fairer.</note> the <hi>VVall</hi> augments their bigneÅ¿s, and gives them an admirable Vermilion, and principally, it Å¿ecures us of a more certain crop of them. But both Å¿orts of them are equally good for preÅ¿erving; the beÅ¿t of them are a little Å¿ugred, but yet moÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a Å¿ubÅ¿tance too like Dough. There are few <hi>Gardens</hi> where there muÅ¿t not be Å¿ome one <hi>Tree</hi> of them. This Fruit is early; that is, it begins to appear at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>July,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially a Å¿mall Å¿ort called the <hi>HaÅ¿ting Apricock,</hi> and which muÅ¿t <note place="margin">The little July <hi>HaÅ¿ting</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Apricock.</hi>
                           </note> be planted in the full <hi>South</hi> Quarter; the Pulp of this latter is very white, and the Leaf rounder and greener than that of the others, but is never a whit better than they for that.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ordinary Apricocks</hi> which are much larger, and have a Yellow Pulp, ripen not <note place="margin">The <hi>Common</hi> and larger one, about Mid <hi>July.</hi>
                           </note> till about the Middle of <hi>July;</hi> we muÅ¿t have Å¿ome of them in every one of the four <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> if we have Walling enough to Å¿pare, or otherwiÅ¿e we may chance to want wherewithall to make the beÅ¿t of all our <hi>Compotes,</hi> or wet Sweet-meats, a thing that is very Å¿urpriÅ¿ing to conÅ¿ider, that Fire and Sugar Å¿hould be able to raiÅ¿e up and awaken in an <hi>Apricock</hi> when preÅ¿erved, a certain perfume which was not perceivable, but Å¿eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie Dormant while it was raw.</p>
                        <p>The reaÅ¿on why I would have Å¿ome of them planted in all Å¿orts of <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> is, becauÅ¿e, putting forth their BloÅ¿Å¿oms very early, that is, in the middle of <hi>March,</hi> a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on much traverÅ¿ed with white hoar FroÅ¿ts, which are of mortal influence to their BloÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oms, from what Å¿ide Å¿oever the cold wind comes to blow full upon them; it certainly freezes and nips thoÅ¿e BloÅ¿Å¿oms dead, and lets but few of them eÅ¿cape, and becauÅ¿e the Winds that reign in the <hi>Spring,</hi> do not every year blow full upon all the four Walls of a Garden, that which Å¿hall happen not to be afflicted with their pernicious BlaÅ¿ts, may at leaÅ¿t recompenÅ¿e us for the loÅ¿s our Trees may have Å¿uffered on other Å¿ides; and by this means, Å¿ometimes we have had of theÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> on the <hi>North-Å¿ide</hi> Wall of our Gardens, when we could have none neither on the <hi>EaÅ¿tern, Southern,</hi> nor <hi>WeÅ¿tern</hi> Quarters, and Å¿ometimes the happy Å¿ide is only on the <hi>South,</hi> Å¿ometimes on the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> and Å¿ometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, only on the <hi>WeÅ¿t.</hi> And therefore as far as our convenience will permit us, we Å¿hould venture Å¿ome Trees in all the Å¿everal <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> that we may not fail in one or other of them, to have Å¿ome <hi>Apricocks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if there knit too great a number of them, as it often happens, we muÅ¿t not fail to pluck a great many of them, being aÅ¿Å¿ured of this Satisfaction, that they will not be <note place="margin">No green <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿o good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve, as <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks.</hi>
                           </note> loÅ¿t as thoÅ¿e commonly are which we are forced to take away Å¿mall and green, of other <hi>Fruits;</hi> but that they may be employed in making green <hi>Compotes,</hi> or wet <hi>Sweet-meats,</hi>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48210:103"/>
and dry ones too, and all of them Å¿o very good, as we Å¿hould hardly dare, without the encouragement of experience, to hope they could be.</p>
                        <p>In the Country of <hi>Anjou</hi> we have commonly a little Å¿ort of <hi>Apricock,</hi> with a Kernel Å¿o Å¿weet, that one would almoÅ¿t take them for <hi>Filberts,</hi> and accordingly we often crack <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Anjou Sweet Kernel'd Apricock.</note> the Stones for to eat them. This Å¿ort of <hi>Apricock</hi> has a white Pulp, and is very good in that Country, but they moÅ¿t of them grow on <hi>Standard Trees,</hi> and that is it which has Å¿o well eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed the Reputation of their GoodneÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>In very hot Years, Å¿uch as was the Year 1676. if there chance to remain any <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,</hi> for any long time upon our <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> they acquire there almoÅ¿t the Å¿ame Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they do when they are preÅ¿erved, after they have quite loÅ¿t a certain Å¿harpneÅ¿s which is natural to them, as we have proved to our great Surprize.</p>
                        <p>Having then ran through and examined all the Å¿everal Å¿orts of Fruits that are fit to be employed in Å¿tocking our <hi>Wall-Plantations,</hi> let us now diÅ¿poÅ¿e of them againÅ¿t our Walls, in that Order of Rank and Precedence, as their greater or leÅ¿Å¿er Excellencies Å¿hall deÅ¿erve; in order to which, let me tell you,</p>

                        <p>And I Å¿hall call a midling or indifferent <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> that which is towards the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> and a <hi>bad</hi> one, that which is towards the <hi>North.</hi> This being laid down as a <hi>Ground,</hi> my <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fig-trees,</hi> where to be placed.</note> Advice is, that if a Gentleman has but never Å¿o Å¿mall a Proportion of the good <hi>ExpoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that he Å¿hould plant a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> there of the <hi>White Round</hi> Å¿ort, which of all <hi>Figs,</hi> is, without Contradiction, the beÅ¿t, and Å¿ince whatever it coÅ¿t, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to have a few <hi>Figs,</hi> he can never chooÅ¿e a better Å¿ort than that.

                        <p>When the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> is placed, there may perhaps remain Å¿till to us in that little <hi>Garden,</hi> about twenty yards of good Walling, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing one of the good Å¿ides be not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the facing of a Building, or in Rails, which is ordinary enough, in which caÅ¿e, the number of our good <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> will be Å¿o much leÅ¿Å¿ened, and our number of <hi>Trees</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e.

                           <note place="margin">The choice <hi>Peach-trees</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> we are to plant here, to fill up with the beÅ¿t advantage the little room we have.</p>
                        <p>I am not for any of thoÅ¿e that bring Å¿mall <hi>Peaches,</hi> though the <hi>Troy-Peach</hi> be to my liking, one of the beÅ¿t that can grow, it being better to Å¿tay a little longer before we begin to have <hi>Peaches</hi> in our little <hi>Garden,</hi> that we may begin with the large Stones at the very firÅ¿t; and beÅ¿ides, we muÅ¿t have here Å¿uch as are moÅ¿t certain and conÅ¿tant in bearing, and are leaÅ¿t Å¿ubject to be poÅ¿ter'd with <hi>Ants,</hi> and by that Rule, the <hi>White, Maudlins</hi> will likewiÅ¿e be excluded for their Å¿mallneÅ¿s, as well as thoÅ¿e of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Violet HaÅ¿ting Peach,</hi> is in truth, the beÅ¿t of all <hi>Peaches,</hi> it is that which has the moÅ¿t delicious and perfumed Pulp, and the moÅ¿t vinous, rich, and noble taÅ¿te of all them, and that which with good right, might claim the firÅ¿t place, both here and every where elÅ¿e, but that it is not large enough. The <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> has almoÅ¿t all the good qualities that can be deÅ¿ired, and has no bad ones; It produces a goodly <hi>Tree,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Admirable Peach deÅ¿cribed.</note> is one of our roundeÅ¿t and largeÅ¿t <hi>Peaches;</hi> it is of a lovely Colour, and has a firm, fine, and melting Pulp, a Å¿weet and Å¿ugred Juice, and a vinous, rich, and exquiÅ¿ite taÅ¿te; it has but a Å¿mall Stone, and is not Å¿ubject to degenerate into a Doughy SubÅ¿tance; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a long time upon the <hi>Tree</hi> to delight the Eye, ripens about <hi>Mid-September,</hi> and is of great increaÅ¿e, that is to Å¿ay in a Word, it is one of the moÅ¿t accompliÅ¿hed <hi>Peaches</hi> we know, and therefore I would by no means plant any <hi>Garden</hi> without Å¿ome <hi>Tree</hi> of this, and of the <hi>Violet Peach</hi> too. But if I had room but for one of the two, I Å¿hould without doubt preferr the <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> before the other, though the <hi>Violet Peach</hi> do really excell it in GoodneÅ¿s, but I Å¿hould take the contrary reÅ¿olution if they were both of an equal bigneÅ¿s. This <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> grows kindly enough in <hi>Midling ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> but yet Å¿till better in <hi>good</hi> ones, and therefore to manage well the little room we have, it is better to place this <hi>Peach</hi> near the <hi>Northern ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> than any of all the other kinds, and where ever we have convenience to plant two or three <hi>Trees</hi> of it, it will be beÅ¿t to Å¿eparate them by placing one in each <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> and always to contrive to have one of them at leaÅ¿t in a good Situation, that Å¿o we may take advantage of experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what this kind is able to do in all of them.</p>
                        <p>I have here two things more to Å¿ay concerning this <hi>Peach,</hi> which I have no mind nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forget, nor to put off to another place. The firÅ¿t is, that contrary to the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im I have above laid down, the <hi>Admirable Peaches</hi> that ripen laÅ¿t upon the <hi>Tree</hi> are the beÅ¿t, they having had the time that <hi>Peaches</hi> need for the acquiring of a perfect maturity, for they are not Fruits to ripen or mellow off of their <hi>Trees,</hi> though one may keep them three or four days without Å¿poiling; where note, that unleÅ¿s its <hi>Tree</hi> be very vigorous, this <hi>Peach</hi> is very Å¿ubject to fall off half ripe, greeniÅ¿h, and all downy, and then all the vinous and lively taÅ¿te it Å¿hould have, degenerates into bitterneÅ¿s and Å¿owre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and its Pulp which Å¿hould be Å¿o fine and melting is courÅ¿e, and almoÅ¿t dry. In fine, its Stone is bigger than it Å¿hould be; nay, and Å¿ometimes gapes, all very ill Å¿igns and Symptoms, which we Å¿ee not in the Fruit of found <hi>Trees,</hi> and which never fail to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all <hi>Peaches</hi> that fall of themÅ¿elves before they be full ripe.</p>
                        <p>From whence I draw my Å¿econd ObÅ¿ervation, which is, that when <hi>Trees</hi> have any of <note place="margin">How to cure diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿ed <hi>Peach-trees.</hi>
                           </note> thoÅ¿e defects, we are to reckon no more upon them almoÅ¿t than if they were dead; in that caÅ¿e, we muÅ¿t prune and cut them very cloÅ¿e, to try if being reduced to a leÅ¿s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they will not Å¿hoot forth fairer and Å¿ounder Branches, and conÅ¿equently bear better Fruit, and at the Å¿ame time, we muÅ¿t put our Selves in a Condition to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loÅ¿s we are like to have in thoÅ¿e diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed Trees, by timely planting Å¿ome good <hi>Tree</hi> of the Å¿ame kind in the beÅ¿t place we can chooÅ¿e for it, without which Å¿eaÅ¿onable proviÅ¿ion and precaution, we Shall run the hazard of languiÅ¿hing under the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of having for a long time nothing but Scurvy <hi>Peaches</hi> of that kind, which Å¿hould be the beÅ¿t in the World.</p>
                        <p>And Å¿ince we have room here for five <hi>Peach-trees</hi> we muÅ¿t needs have the <hi>Minion,</hi> the <hi>Belle ChevreuÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>Fair ChevreuÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>Goat peach,</hi> and the <hi>Nivette,</hi> to be of the number, and accordingly we Å¿hall diÅ¿poÅ¿e of our twelve <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or Fathoms of Wall, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Minion Peach</hi> is certainly to the Eye, the moÅ¿t beautiful <hi>Peach</hi> that can be Å¿een. <note place="margin">The <hi>Minion Peach</hi> deÅ¿cribed and commended. Its defects.</note> It is very large, very red, Å¿attin-skin'd, and round. It ripens the firÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e of its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, and has a Å¿ine and very melting Pulp, and a very Å¿mall Stone; its taÅ¿te indeed is not always the richeÅ¿t nor briskeÅ¿t that is, and Å¿ometimes it is a little faint and flat, but that Å¿hall not hinder it from being the third in order here.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fair ChevreuÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>Goat-Peach,</hi> deÅ¿cribes to us in its beautiful name, a good part <note place="margin">The fair <hi>ChevreuÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Goat-peach</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed. The order of ripening of theÅ¿e <hi>Peaches.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>ChevreuÅ¿e</hi> has Å¿ome very conÅ¿iderable advantages; for firÅ¿t, it is hardly inferiour <note place="margin">The <hi>ChevreuÅ¿e Peach</hi> further commended.</note> to any in largeneÅ¿s, in beauty of colour, in godly Å¿hape, which is a little longiÅ¿h, and in abundance of Sugred and well reliÅ¿h'd juice, and over and above all that, it further excells in the great increaÅ¿e it yields, Å¿o that with a great deal of JuÅ¿tice, I place it here for the <note place="margin">Its faults, and their cauÅ¿es.</note> fourth. It has no other fault, than that Å¿ometimes its pulp grows Doughy, but it never contracts that fault but when it is let to ripen too much upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or when it grows in a cold and moiÅ¿t Soil, or when it meets with a <hi>Summer</hi> that is neither hot enough nor dry enough. It moÅ¿t particularly requires to be placed towards the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> and in <hi>Grounds</hi> that are not over moiÅ¿t: it do's well enough in a <hi>WeÅ¿tern ExpoÅ¿ition.</hi> It is a very good Å¿ort of <hi>Peach,</hi> and the commoneÅ¿t with thoÅ¿e that plant them only to Å¿ell.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Nivette,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e called the <hi>Velvet-peach,</hi> is likewiÅ¿e in my opinion, a very fair and large <hi>Peach;</hi> it has Å¿o fine a colour both within and without, that it is moÅ¿t agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The <hi>Nivette</hi> or <hi>Velvet-peach</hi> deÅ¿cribed.

It is not quite Å¿o round as the <hi>Minions</hi> and <hi>Admirables,</hi> but yet comes near enough that Figure, when it grows upon a Å¿ound Branch, otherwiÅ¿e it is a little horned, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a longiÅ¿h Å¿hape. It ripens about the twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> juÅ¿t when the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables</hi> begin to go off, and therefore with Å¿o many good qualities as it produces to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its claim, who dare diÅ¿pute it admittance among the <hi>Wall-trees</hi> in a good <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> where there is room for five <hi>Peach trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If our midling <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition</hi> cannot contain above four <hi>Peach-trees,</hi> then I would fill it up <note place="margin">The Trees advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed for the <hi>Midling</hi> or <hi>VVeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ExpoÅ¿itions</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>This laÅ¿t is one of the <hi>Peach-trees</hi> that bears in greateÅ¿t abundance, and in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The <hi>Purple</hi> or <hi>Vinous-peach,</hi> its Character in this and the next Paragraph.</note> in little <hi>Gardens</hi> we Å¿hould chiefly aim at abundance, for which reaÅ¿on, I preferr it before the <hi>Bourdin,</hi> though that in reality; be the better taÅ¿ted of the two, and thrives as well as that in a <hi>WeÅ¿terly ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> but yields not Å¿o much Fruit. I do not place any <hi>Maudlin-peaches</hi> in this <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition</hi> neither, nor any <hi>Minions, Dandilli's Bellegardes,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they thrive not there, and are all apt there to have a Pulp too much like Dough. This <hi>Purple-peach</hi> denotes its colour by one of its names, and the quality of its taÅ¿t by the other, and in effect, it is of a brown dark red colour, that penetrates pretty much into its Pulp. It is very round and indifferent large, its Pulp is pretty fine, and its taÅ¿te rich and exquiÅ¿ite: In a word, it will very well maintain its place in this little <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>We cannot Å¿peak well enough of the white <hi>Maudlin Peach,</hi> when it is planted in a good Soil, and is well expoÅ¿ed, only the <hi>Ants</hi> make War a little too much againÅ¿t it; and <note place="margin">A remark about <hi>Ants.</hi>
                           </note> what is worÅ¿e, we know not how to Å¿ecure it from them, which reproachful misfortune does it a great deal of prejudice among the Curious.</p>
                        <p>To Å¿ee Å¿ome <hi>Trees</hi> of it bear abundance, and others but little Fruit, Å¿eems to give us good <hi>Grounds</hi> to Å¿ay with Å¿ome <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> that there are two Å¿orts of them, one which they call the <hi>great</hi> one, and the other the <hi>little</hi> one; but yet for all that, neither by their Flower, which in both is large, and has but a little bluÅ¿h of Red, nor by the Leaf of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which in both is large, and very much dented, nor by their ripening, which happens to both at the Å¿ame time, being towards the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> nor by their colour, bigneÅ¿s, Å¿hape, juice, taÅ¿te, nor Stone, which are alike in both of them; no, not by all theÅ¿e marks, I Å¿ay, which ought to conÅ¿titute an eÅ¿Å¿ential difference, can I find Å¿ufficient reaÅ¿on to perÅ¿wade me to embrace the Opinion of thoÅ¿e that think there are two diÅ¿tinct Å¿orts of them, both of them being large, round, and half flat, very much painted with red on the Sunny Å¿ide, and not at all on the other, and have a fine Pulp, a Å¿weet and Å¿ugred juice, a rich taÅ¿te, no red about their Stone, which Stone in them both, is Å¿hort, and almoÅ¿t round, all which conÅ¿idered, Å¿uÅ¿pends my Judgment as to the Point of their being two different kinds.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides which, I have obÅ¿erved, that they both produce very goodly <hi>Trees,</hi> and that when I have brought up Å¿tocks both of that pretended Å¿ort that yielded but little Fruit, and of that that bore a great deal, and taken Å¿ome grafts from that which bore a great deal, and grafted them upon thoÅ¿e that bore but little, yet the <hi>Trees</hi> they produced, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me very little Fruit.</p>
                        <p>So that in ConcluÅ¿ion, I believe this difference in their bearing, proceeds only from the greater or leÅ¿Å¿er vigour of the Å¿tock of the <hi>Tree;</hi> that which has a great deal, produces greater main Branches, and fewer Å¿mall Å¿hoots, whereas the other on the contrary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces leÅ¿Å¿er main Branches, and more Å¿mall Å¿hoots; now the main Branches, as we have already, Å¿o many times inculcated, yield no Fruit, but 'tis the Å¿mall Å¿hoots only that are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48210:105"/>
the bearing Branches, and if we give but a larger extent of Wall to theÅ¿e Å¿trong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous <hi>Trees,</hi> and leave them thick Branches enough, and leave them a little longer than ordinary, we Å¿hall Å¿ee that when they have more room to Å¿pend their fury in, they will put forth no more Å¿uch thick Branches, but will Å¿hoot out more Å¿mall ones, and conÅ¿equently will give us more Satisfaction and PleaÅ¿ure.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>PerÅ¿ick Peach</hi> is a Fruit of a marvellous increaÅ¿e, and of; no leÅ¿s admirable taÅ¿te; it <note place="margin">The <hi>PerÅ¿ick Peach</hi> deÅ¿cribed with its Character.</note> is longiÅ¿h, and has all the good qualities we can wiÅ¿h it, when the <hi>Tree</hi> is in health, and grows in a good <hi>Ground,</hi> and well expoÅ¿ed, and as the Stones come pretty near the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of their Fruit; that of the <hi>PerÅ¿ick Peach</hi> is a little longiÅ¿h, the Pulp which is next to it, is but very little tinged with Red. It ripens juÅ¿t when the <hi>ChevreuÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Goat-peach</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and a little before the <hi>Admirable</hi> comes in, that is to Å¿ay, it very commodiouÅ¿ly chooÅ¿es the time which is moÅ¿t advantageous to us.

                        <p>And in the Å¿pace between the One and Two and Twentieth, I have a great mind to <note place="margin">The Violet <hi>Brug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> or <hi>Nectarin,</hi> its DeÅ¿cription and Character.</note> place a Violet <hi>Brugnon,</hi> or <hi>Nectarin,</hi> that in this Number we may have at leaÅ¿t one Å¿ort of Fruit, that we may carry a good way without Å¿poiling.

So many good Qualities therefore cannot but juÅ¿tifie my Choice.</p>

                        <p>BeÅ¿ides what I have before Å¿aid of the <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> concerning their Å¿mallneÅ¿s, the time of their Ripening, and their good TaÅ¿t, I have nothing elÅ¿e to add, but that they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much tinged with Red, and are round, with a little kind of Teat at the end; their Flower is of the greateÅ¿t Size, and we are very unhappy that we cannot defend them from the <hi>Ants:</hi> The <hi>Trees,</hi> neither of this Å¿ort, nor of the <hi>Avant,</hi> or <hi>Forward Peaches,</hi> are Å¿o large as other <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and for that reaÅ¿on, may be allow'd Å¿omething leÅ¿s place than the others, which may amount to the retrenching of a Foot, or a Foot and a half for both of them: They laÅ¿t not Å¿o long as the reÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>The St. <hi>Catharine-Plum</hi> Planted againÅ¿t a Wall, in a good <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> and in a good <note place="margin">The St. <hi>Catharine Plum</hi> deÅ¿cribed. The effect of a good Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> Soil, will certainly Å¿urprize both thoÅ¿e that know it but little, and thoÅ¿e that thinking they know it, diÅ¿eÅ¿teem it: For in this Å¿ituation, there can hardly grow a better Fruit in the World, if it may be allowed time to Ripen, Å¿o that it grows wrinkled about the Stalk: It is, as I have Å¿aid, a White or Pale YellowiÅ¿h <hi>Plum,</hi> of a longiÅ¿h Figure, and pretty large, and that parts very clean from its Stone.</p>
                        <p>I cannot tell whether I may not Å¿ay, that, notwithÅ¿tanding the ill report it always had to be abÅ¿olutely good for nothing elÅ¿e but to make <hi>Prunes,</hi> I am the firÅ¿t that have done it the honour to advance it to the choice Å¿tation of the Wall; but truly I have found it Å¿o well to anÅ¿wer my expectation there, that I cannot Å¿ufficiently extoll it in that reÅ¿pect. And as I have been always a great Å¿earcher out of Experiments, I have likewiÅ¿e made trial, whether there might not be Å¿ome other <hi>Plums</hi> which might find Å¿ome aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance from the Wall towards the improvement of their Excellence, as well as the <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> and St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> as we found, had done; but as I Å¿hall afterwards more amply tell you, inÅ¿tead of meeting with any good Å¿ucceÅ¿s with them, I only found that they very much diÅ¿honoured themÅ¿elves in that Noble Situation.</p>
                        <p>The Wall has almoÅ¿t the Å¿ame effects upon theÅ¿e good <hi>Plums,</hi> as boiling Sugar has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿ome certain Fruits, Å¿ome of which it very notably improves in goodneÅ¿s, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Apricocks;</hi> and others, it as Å¿enÅ¿ibly Å¿poils, Å¿uch as are commonly <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> when they are Ripe enough to be Eaten Raw.</p>
                        <p>However, I am well enough Å¿atisfied, that I have found but few <hi>Plums</hi> receive any addition of perfection by the influence of the Wall, Å¿ince at leaÅ¿t by making trial, I am now convinced of the vanity of the hopes I once had, that they might, and by conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, am now able to Å¿ave any other Gentleman that may have the Å¿ame CurioÅ¿ity, the expence of time and pains that I have been at, to content it.</p>

                           <hi>In the Å¿pace from the Twenty Fifth to the Twenty Sixth ToiÅ¿e, or Fathom, we will place a firÅ¿t Yellow</hi> Admirable-Peach.</p>

                        <p>Both the one and the other are Coloured pretty much with <hi>Red</hi> on the Å¿unny-Å¿ide, and that <hi>Red</hi> pierces a little more about the Stone of the <hi>Yellow</hi> one, than about that of the <note place="margin">Its Character.</note>

                        <p>As alÅ¿o in CaÅ¿e their <hi>Northern-Wall</hi> has more Extent, which may very well be, they may augment the number of thoÅ¿e <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> which they find I have expreÅ¿Å¿ed the moÅ¿t eÅ¿teem for, which will be either the <hi>Butter-Pears,</hi> the <hi>Bergamots,</hi> the <hi>Virgoulees,</hi> or the <hi>Verte Longues,</hi> or <hi>Long Green Pears,</hi> as they Å¿hall find moÅ¿t agreeable to their palates, and moÅ¿t anÅ¿werable to their occaÅ¿ions; and likewiÅ¿e if their <hi>North quarter</hi> has leÅ¿s room than I have Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, they may plant Å¿o many the fewer <hi>Trees,</hi> and content themÅ¿elves with that number which I have aÅ¿Å¿igned for an extent of <hi>Walling</hi> equal to theirs.</p>
                        <p>We have already filled up a <hi>WeÅ¿tern-Wall</hi> of about five or Å¿ix <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or Fathoms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with four Trees, which are one <hi>Apricock-</hi>Tree, and three <hi>Peach-trees;</hi> namely, an <hi>Admirable,</hi> a <hi>ChevreuÅ¿e,</hi> and a <hi>Purple peach.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> and <hi>Apricock-Trees</hi> are not Å¿o Subject to die young, in part or in whole, as the <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and therefore are able, as one may Å¿ay, to Å¿upport in Å¿ome manner the Honour of the <hi>Wall-Plantations,</hi> when there happens any afflicting accident, or Mortality to the poor <hi>Peach-Trees.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And here I think is the proper place to tell you, that when I have Å¿een what number of <hi>Trees</hi> of any one certain kind, as of <hi>Peach-Trees, Pear-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. I am to plant in any certain <hi>Wall-Plantation;</hi> as for example, how many <hi>Violet,</hi> or <hi>Admirable Peach-Trees,</hi> how many <hi>Boncretien,</hi> or <hi>Berganot Pear Trees,</hi> &amp;c. I deÅ¿ign for my <hi>EaÅ¿t, South, WeÅ¿t,</hi> or <hi>North ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> I place together, and all one after another, firÅ¿t, all the <hi>Trees</hi> of one Å¿ort, as all the <hi>Violet Peaches,</hi> and in theÅ¿ecnod place, all the <hi>Trees</hi> of another kind, likewiÅ¿e one after another, as all the <hi>Admirables</hi> &amp;c, without mixing any of the kinds one with another: As finding that to make better both for the commodity of Gather'ing the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and for preventing any loÅ¿s of it.</p>
                        <p>And I never made any other intermixture, as I have already told you, but of <hi>Apricock-Trees</hi> among <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> as I likewiÅ¿e uÅ¿e to do of <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> among <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> unleÅ¿s I have a <note place="margin">When <hi>Apricock</hi> or <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> may be mixed with <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and when not.</note> Å¿eparate <hi>Garden</hi> big enough to hold all the <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> the extent of my Ground requires, for then I reduce them all into that one place; The Å¿ame thing I do with <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For five hundred and forty <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> length of <hi>Fruit Walling,</hi> allowing about a hundred and thirty five to each <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> methinks, to fill up our additional fifteen <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> of <hi>Wall</hi> towards the <hi>South,</hi> it would not be amiÅ¿s for certain curious PerÅ¿ons to introduce here eight foot of <hi>Early</hi> or <hi>Forward Grapes,</hi> which will take up the room of two <hi>Trees, 2 Azeroll</hi> or <hi>Garden Hawthorn,</hi> or <hi>White Thorn-Trees,</hi> twenty foot of <hi>White MuÅ¿cat Grapes,</hi> and ten foot of <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿ela's;</hi> or if they pleaÅ¿e, rather ten foot of <hi>Cioutat Grapes.</hi> As for the early <hi>Cherry-Trees,</hi> Å¿even foot will afford room enough for them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Azeroll,</hi> or <hi>Garden Haw,</hi> is a kind of White <hi>Thorn,</hi> which produces a <hi>Fruit</hi> like both in colour and Å¿hape, to that of the <hi>Common White Thorn,</hi> but it is twice as big, and its Eye or Crown is great, and very open; its Å¿talk is Å¿hort, Å¿mall, and Å¿et hollow into the <note place="margin">The <hi>Azeroll</hi> or <hi>Garden Haw</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed.</note> 
                           <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is yellow, and Doughy, having two great Å¿tones within it, which is the reaÅ¿on the <hi>Fruit</hi> has but little Pulp: Its taÅ¿te is Å¿harp and Å¿owriÅ¿h, which pleaÅ¿es certain perÅ¿ons, and therefore when we have five or Å¿ix hundred <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> length of Wall, it is not amiÅ¿s to plant a couple of Å¿tocks of them. It Å¿hoots forth a great many boughs, and conÅ¿equently, its <hi>Tree</hi> is fair enough; Its leaf is a little Larger than that of the <hi>Common White Thorn,</hi> but it is nothing high Å¿o fruitful as that.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Early</hi> or <hi>Forward Grape,</hi> is a Å¿ort of <hi>Black Morillion,</hi> which takes colour very early, which makes it appear ripe long before it is; Its skin is very tough, and when it is ripe, <note place="margin">The <hi>Early Grape,</hi> or <hi>Black Morillon</hi> DeÅ¿cribed. It ripens in the beginning of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                           </note> the <hi>Grape</hi> is very Å¿weet. They appear commonly at the very beginning of <hi>July.</hi> It may eaÅ¿ily be Å¿een, I make no very great account of them, by my Å¿o long deferring to place them; but when we have a great quantity of Walling, we may plant Å¿ome few of them for CurioÅ¿ity.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Cioutat Grapes,</hi> I leave the Curious at their own Liberty to preferr it here before the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿ela's,</hi> if they pleaÅ¿e. The <hi>Fruit</hi> of both of them is very like in all things, as colour, bigneÅ¿s, and taÅ¿te; only the leaf of the <hi>Cioutat Vine,</hi> is dented all about the edges like <hi>ParÅ¿ley,</hi> and beÅ¿ides, it Å¿eems to bear more <hi>Fruit</hi> than the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿ela's,</hi> but yet I like the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿ela's</hi> better, and nothing but pure curioÅ¿ity can induce me to plant Å¿ome feet of it in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> the fifteen <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> added towards the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> to make up its proportion of a hundred thirty five, Å¿hall receive two <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> an eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth <hi>Minion Peach,</hi> a ninth and tenth <hi>White Maudlin,</hi> a thirteenth and fourteenth <hi>HaÅ¿ting</hi> or <hi>Forward Violet Peach,</hi> and a ninth and tenth <hi>Admirable.</hi>

                        <p>I have already declared my Judgment, that there is but a Å¿mall difference to be made between the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>EaÅ¿tern ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> except it be for raiÅ¿ing of <hi>HaÅ¿tings,</hi> Å¿uch as are <hi>PeaÅ¿e, Beans,</hi> or <hi>Artichoaks,</hi> which we would plant in a Sloped Bank, and for <hi>Early Cherries, Early Grapes, HaÅ¿ting Apricocks,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly for <hi>MuÅ¿cat Grapes,</hi> and <hi>Little MuÅ¿cat Pears,</hi> which I would likewiÅ¿e adviÅ¿e you to place in a <hi>Southern AÅ¿pect;</hi> and the reaÅ¿on that obliged me to mix theÅ¿e two <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> together, was becauÅ¿e very often <hi>Gardens</hi> are Å¿o contrived, that one of theÅ¿e two <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> is quite wanting in them, and therefore either of them that is found there, ought in that <hi>Garden</hi> to be made to Å¿upply the place of both the two. And indeed how many <hi>Gardens</hi> do we Å¿ee that have but one great Wall towards the <hi>South,</hi> or one great Wall towards the <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> with little or none at all towards the other quarters; But 'tis not the Å¿ame thing as to the <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions</hi> of the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> or <hi>North,</hi> very few perÅ¿ons ever being guilty of Å¿uch ill contrivance, to have a <hi>Garden</hi> only furniÅ¿h't with Wall, towards thoÅ¿e <hi>AÅ¿pects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore they which are accommodated only with a <hi>Southern</hi> Wall, may very well furniÅ¿h it with all thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> I have aÅ¿Å¿igned for that and an <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> one too, and in like manner thoÅ¿e Gentlemen that have only the convenience of an <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> Wall, Å¿ince they cannot have all the advantage they might expect from a <hi>Southern AÅ¿pect,</hi> ought to content themÅ¿elves, and make the beÅ¿t of their <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> ones, by planting in it all the Å¿ame things that are aÅ¿Å¿igned for both that, and a <hi>Southern</hi> one; for theÅ¿e two <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions,</hi> as is well

knwon, are capable of receiving every thing that is Å¿it to be planted in the other two; whereas the other two <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> are not Å¿it to be made uÅ¿e of for the moÅ¿t part of thoÅ¿e things that require the <hi>ExpoÅ¿itions</hi> of the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> and conÅ¿equently, we ought not eaÅ¿ily to hazard to plant towards the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> any <hi>MuÅ¿cat Grapes, HaÅ¿ting Cherries, HaÅ¿ting PeaÅ¿e, Plums</hi> to eat Raw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>I have one obÅ¿ervation more to offer to thoÅ¿e who have much Walling towards the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> and none towards the <hi>North,</hi> which is that they may very well forbear plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards their <hi>South</hi> or <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> many things which I have aÅ¿Å¿igned for a <hi>Northern</hi> Wall; as for Example, Å¿ome Baking <hi>Pears, Bourdelai's,</hi> or <hi>Verjuice Grapes, GooÅ¿e-berries, Currans, RaÅ¿p-berries,</hi> &amp;c. the places of the <hi>Southern ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> Å¿eeming to me too precious to be beÅ¿towed upon Fruits of Å¿o little value, and that thrive well enough without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of any Walls, unleÅ¿s they know not how to chooÅ¿e any thing better wherewithal to Å¿ill up their <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> Walls.</p>
                        <p>But Å¿uch Gentlemen as are accommodated with both an <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> and <hi>Southern ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> may divide into two parts thoÅ¿e things which I have placed under the Å¿ingle head of a Good <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> and may proportion them equally or unequally according to the extent of their Å¿everal Walls, only taking care to reÅ¿erve for the <hi>Southern AÅ¿pect,</hi> thoÅ¿e things which are chiefly valuable for their precocity, and early advance in Maturity.</p>

                           <hi>Plums</hi> are a Å¿ort of Fruit that is pleaÅ¿ing enough to every Body, and <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿per well enough in all Å¿orts of Ground, let it be dry and Å¿andy, or moiÅ¿t and hearty. <note place="margin">How to order a <hi>Plum</hi> or <hi>Cherry Garden.</hi>
                           </note> They every where produce very Å¿ightly <hi>Trees,</hi> both <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flouriÅ¿h very much every where; But they are likewiÅ¿e very Å¿ubject every where unfortunately to miÅ¿carry in their BloÅ¿Å¿oms, becauÅ¿e there often happen <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> in the <hi>Spring</hi> that deÅ¿troy them, which is the cauÅ¿e that <hi>Plums</hi> are very often Å¿carce. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever when they meet with a favourable <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> they produce an unconceivable quantity of Fruit.</p>
                        <p>We have Å¿ome certain kinds of them, whoÅ¿e BloÅ¿Å¿oms are much more tender and Å¿uÅ¿ceptible of the injuries of an unkind Å¿eaÅ¿on, than others, as for Example, the <hi>Perdri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Violet</hi> one; and therefore I would have none of them planted in the open air, eÅ¿pecially in Countries that are inclining to cold, or on thoÅ¿e Å¿ides that are a little more Å¿ubject than the reÅ¿t, to the inÅ¿ults of the <hi>FroÅ¿ts;</hi> My Å¿elf for that reaÅ¿on, as well as for the improving them to a greater perfection of goodneÅ¿s, taking care to plant them by Walls, as I have already told you.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Plums</hi> that are a little better able to defend themÅ¿elves, are the <hi>Cernay Perdrigons,</hi> of which I make little account; and next them, all the Å¿orts of <hi>Damask Plums,</hi> among which I moÅ¿t particularly value, the <hi>Red</hi> or <hi>Round Violet,</hi> the <hi>Great White,</hi> and the <hi>Latter Black Damasks,</hi> the <hi>Queen Claudia,</hi> the <hi>Violet Imperial,</hi> the St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> the <hi>Apricock Plum,</hi> the <hi>White Mirabel,</hi> the <hi>Violet Diaper Plum,</hi> the <hi>Diapred Roche Courbon,</hi> the <hi>Royal Plum,</hi> the <hi>Minion Plum,</hi> the <hi>Brugnolle,</hi> the <hi>EmpreÅ¿s,</hi> the <hi>HaÅ¿ting</hi> or <hi>Forward Morin,</hi> and the <hi>CeriÅ¿Å¿et</hi> or <hi>Little Cherry Plum:</hi> All which Å¿ixteen Å¿orts are very good <hi>Raw,</hi> and <note place="margin">Sixteen choice Sorts of <hi>Plums</hi> good every way. <hi>Plums</hi> good only to Dry, PreÅ¿erve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Thus InÅ¿enÅ¿ibly we might form a <hi>Plum Garden,</hi> of fourÅ¿core or a hundred Stocks of Trees; and that is a great deal, conÅ¿idering how little a while that Fruit laÅ¿ts when it comes, and how troubleÅ¿ome it is when it takes up a great deal of Room to no purpoÅ¿e, as it often happens; for when they take, that number is enough to furniÅ¿h us a Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent abundance of <hi>Plums,</hi> to convert into both <hi>Prunes</hi> and <hi>Sweet-meats.</hi>

                        <p>The number of the other Å¿orts of <hi>Plums</hi> is very great, and they that have a mind to it, may Å¿tuff their Gardens with them, if they pleaÅ¿e, but at leaÅ¿t they Å¿hall have no reaÅ¿on to blame me for counÅ¿elling them to it.</p>
                        <p>About mid-<hi>June</hi> the <hi>Red Fruits</hi> begin to come in, and hold at leaÅ¿t till the end of <hi>July.</hi> Among which I reckon <hi>Cherries, Griots,</hi> and <hi>Bigarro's</hi> or <hi>Heart Cherries,</hi> to be the moÅ¿t principal; we may have <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> of them, but <hi>Standards</hi> are better. They are <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿o well known every where, that they need no DeÅ¿cription, I prize none of them Å¿o particularly as the Large <hi>Latter Cherries,</hi> which they call <hi>Monmorancies,</hi> and next them the <hi>Bigarro's,</hi> or <hi>Heart Cherries,</hi> and in the third place the <hi>Griots</hi> or <hi>Agriots.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IF the Trees be already pull'd up, we muÅ¿t not only have regard to all the particulars above expreÅ¿Å¿ed, without neglecting one of them, but we muÅ¿t beÅ¿ides have a care <note place="margin">Now to chooÅ¿e Trees when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken up. Marks of Trees Å¿poiled.</note> they have not been too long taken up; Å¿o that their bark is grown Å¿hriveled, and their wood dry, and perhaps quite dead; or that their bark be not too much peeled off, or the grafting place Å¿trangled with too hard binding with Pack-thred, or that they be not grafted too low, and eÅ¿pecially in Peach-Trees, Å¿o that to place the roots as they Å¿hould be, we muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be forced to bury the Grafts under Ground in planting them; or elÅ¿e grafted too high, Å¿o that they cannot begin a well proportioned <hi>Wall,</hi> or <hi>DwarÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tree,</hi> both which ought to begin about Å¿ix or Å¿even inches from the Ground.</p>
                        <p>But this is not all, for we muÅ¿t take Å¿pecial heed too to the roots, becauÅ¿e though they had all the other neceÅ¿Å¿ary good qualifications in perfection, yet if their roots be much defective, we muÅ¿t e'en reckon Å¿uch Trees good for nothing.</p>
                        <p>To be able to pronunce a Tree then to be well qualified as to its roots, in the firÅ¿t place they muÅ¿t be of a proportionable thickneÅ¿s to the bigneÅ¿s of the Tree, that is, it <note place="margin">Good qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required in the roots of young Trees.</note> muÅ¿t have at leaÅ¿t one root very near as big as the body of the Tree; for when they are all Å¿mall and <hi>Fibrous,</hi> and like a head of Hair, it is almoÅ¿t an infallible Å¿ign of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Tree, and of its approaching death, or at leaÅ¿t of its never being likely to produce any good effect; neither is the over great quantity of Å¿uch <hi>Fibres</hi> any very good <note place="margin">Marks of a Dying Tree.</note> Å¿ign.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd place we muÅ¿t Å¿ee that the principal roots be neither rotten nor Å¿plit, nor very much peeled or unbarked, nor grown very red, or dry or hard; for if they be rotten, they Å¿how a great infirmity in the principle of life of the whole Tree, the roots never rotting when the Tree is in good health; If they be Å¿plit in the place out of which they Spring, it is a wound that may be termed incurable, and the <hi>Gangreen</hi> and <hi>RottenneÅ¿s</hi> will Å¿ieze upon it, and Å¿o it will be left like a Work-man without either hands or tools.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, they who pull up Trees Å¿hould be very careful to do it dextrouÅ¿ly and gently, and for that effect to make good holes, that they may not be obliged to Å¿train <note place="margin">What caution is to be uÅ¿ed in taking up Trees.</note> any part of them too violently when they draw them up, or elÅ¿e they will not fail to Å¿plit or break Å¿ome good Root or other.</p>

                           <p>How to prepare a Tree for Planting.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THis preparation is of Å¿o great a conÅ¿equence for the making of Trees take new foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and grow again, that very often they take, and produce a good effect only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they were well prepared before they were replanted, and no leÅ¿s often fail taking, or producing a good head or top, becauÅ¿e they were ill prepared.</p>
                        <p>There are two things to be prepared in them, <hi>viz.</hi> a leÅ¿s principal one which is the head or top, and another which is moÅ¿t highly principal, and important, and that is the foot or roots.</p>
                        <p>As to the head, there is but little myÅ¿tery in ordering that, either in <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> it being needful only for that effect, to remember theÅ¿e two points.</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t is, that as it appears, we do a great prejudice to a Tree when we pluck it up, becauÅ¿e we always weaken it thereby, and abate its vigour, and its activity at leaÅ¿t for Å¿ome time, we muÅ¿t therefore take off Å¿o much of its charge and burthen about its head, as may be proportionable to what we take from it of that Å¿trength and activity, as we certainly do by removing to a new place, and retrenching it of Å¿ome of its Roots: That is a maxim that needs no proof.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd point, we are to be mindful of, is, that we muÅ¿t leave its body no higher than is convenient for the uÅ¿e the Tree is deÅ¿igned for: Some being to produce their effect very low, as the <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> which therefore muÅ¿t be cut pretty Å¿hort, and others to produce theirs very high, as the <hi>Standard-Trees</hi> which therefore muÅ¿t be left of a conÅ¿iderable height: But I Å¿eldom cut either Å¿ort of them to the length they are to be of, till I have firÅ¿t finiÅ¿h'd the whole operation, that is to be performed about their roots. And this is the Method I obÅ¿erve in doing it. <note place="margin">The Author's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in Triming the Roots of Trees.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, I order all the <hi>Fibres</hi> to be cut off as near as can be to the place out of which it Å¿prings, unleÅ¿s it be a Tree that I plant again aÅ¿Å¿oon as ever 'tis pluck'd up, without leaving it a moment out of the Ground, otherwiÅ¿e if it continue never Å¿o little while in the air, all that would be good to preÅ¿erve of its root, which is a kind of tuft of White Å¿mall hair like roots or <hi>Fibres,</hi> turns, preÅ¿ently black, and conÅ¿equently Å¿poils, being, as it Å¿eems no more able to endure the air, than Å¿ome Å¿orts of fiÅ¿h that die as Å¿oon as ever they are out of the Water. But we can never have opportunity to Å¿ave this White <hi>Fibrous</hi> part of the roots, but when we pull up a Tree in one part of our Garden, to plant it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in another place of the Å¿ame Garden, for then indeed we may Å¿ave Å¿ome part of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fibres</hi> which is not broken, and whoÅ¿e extremities or points appear Å¿till acting as 'twere, and that comes out of a good place, otherwiÅ¿e if all thoÅ¿e conditions be not found in it, we are not to make any account of it; and for the better preÅ¿ervation of it, we may too at the Å¿ame time, take along with it Å¿ome of its former mold, that hangs next about it, like a kind of Turf, taking care in planting it to place and Å¿pread out well that hairy or <hi>Fibrous</hi> part. <note place="margin">How to order the Roots of a Tree that has been longer pulled up.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>To return now to order a Tree that has been longer pulled up, I firÅ¿t of all then take away all that <hi>Fibrous</hi> or <hi>hairy</hi> part which many Gard'ners Å¿ave with Å¿o much care, and Å¿o little reaÅ¿on, in Å¿uch Trees as thoÅ¿e: And when I am about Å¿tocking any large <hi>Plantation,</hi> Iorder my people immediately to fall to work to retrenching from the Trees, what is to be cut from them, before I plant them, and that both in the day time in Å¿ome bye place of the Garden, and particularly in the night, in Å¿ome place within-doors by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light, to hinder the delaying of Å¿ome other work no leÅ¿s in haÅ¿t, that cannot be done but without-doors; and Å¿o by that means, I take advantage of the night, which comes upon us Å¿o Å¿oon, and Å¿o unconveniently at the uÅ¿ual Å¿eaÅ¿on of making our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48210:122"/>
The <hi>Fibres</hi> being thus taken away, and by that means, the greater roots laid open to my full view, I am the better able to Å¿ee the bad ones to take them quite off, and to diÅ¿cern the good ones to Å¿ave them, and afterwards to regulate the cutting them to the exact length I would leave them of; and very often, when I find the roots of any Trees a little too much dried, I order them to be Å¿teeped Å¿even or eight hours in water before I replant them.</p>
                        <p>When I Å¿peak of good and bad roots, it may be thought I mean by theÅ¿e latter, only Å¿uch roots as are broken, or unbarked, or rotten, or dry; But yet I mean Å¿omething of <note place="margin">What the Author means by Good and bad Roots.</note> greater conÅ¿equence; and that is, that every Tree that is planted, and eÅ¿pecially every NurÅ¿ery-Tree, Å¿hoots out Å¿ometimes, either all good roots, or all bad ones, or both good ones and bad ones at the Å¿ame time, which comes to paÅ¿s as follows.</p>
                        <p>A Tree planted with the preparations recommended by me, if it takes, muÅ¿t Å¿hoot forth new roots, or elÅ¿e it dies, all its old roots being of no Å¿ervice to it; And of thoÅ¿e <note place="margin">Notes how to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h them, and inÅ¿tructions how to deal with them.</note> new ones, Å¿ome are fair and thick, and Å¿ome are feeble and Å¿mall; the fair ones will Å¿pring either out of the Extremities of thoÅ¿e which we left it, which is moÅ¿t to be deÅ¿ired, or elÅ¿e from Å¿ome other part, that is, either from the body of the Tree, and conÅ¿equently above the old roots, which compoÅ¿ed the extream parts of the Tree, or from that part of the old ones that is neareÅ¿t the Body of the Tree, whilÅ¿t the old ones either have Å¿hot out nothing at all throughout their whole extent, or but very Å¿mall roots out of their Extremities, and Å¿ome thicker ones a little further off thoÅ¿e Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>In which two CaÅ¿es, the thick ones growing either out of the Body of the Tree, or out of any part of the old roots but their ends, make all the reÅ¿t both old and new inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly to periÅ¿h, and dwindle away, and therefore the periÅ¿hing ones are to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bad, becauÅ¿e if not taken away, they make the Tree grow Yellow and LanguiÅ¿h in Å¿ome part of its top, or head.</p>
                        <p>It is no hard matter to know the good ones from the bad ones, becauÅ¿e that Å¿uppoÅ¿ing according to the order of nature, the lower part of the Body of the Tree planted, Å¿hould, as in truth it ought, be always bigger than the reÅ¿t of it, and maintain it Å¿elf always in that condition, yet if we perceive that part inÅ¿tead of enlarging it Å¿elf proportionably to the reÅ¿t of the body, according to the Å¿ame order of nature, to remain on the contrary Å¿maller than Å¿ome part a little higher, from whence in effect we find Å¿ome fair roots to Å¿pring, then the unthrifty part is to be looked upon as 'twere <hi>accurÅ¿ed,</hi> and abandoned by <hi>Mother Nature,</hi> which Å¿eems to take pleaÅ¿ure in beÅ¿towing its favours upon another, and conÅ¿equently we muÅ¿t entirely cut away all that leÅ¿Å¿er part with all that it had Å¿hot forth before, (which many Gardiners call <hi>Pivot,</hi> but are miÅ¿taken, as I Å¿hall afterwards <note place="margin">Pivot, a Hinge or Axel-Tree.</note> Å¿hew.)</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t thing to be done then in this caÅ¿e, is entirely to take away all that part of it that appears to be Å¿o abandoned and diÅ¿graced, as cloÅ¿e as we can, to the part well nouriÅ¿hed and which is as 'twere in favour, that we may only preÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e roots that Å¿pring from the fortunate part, what kind of ones, or in how Å¿mall a number Å¿oever they be, for indeed the number of them Å¿hould never be very great; and above all, we muÅ¿t take care as I have Å¿aid, to take away the greateÅ¿t part of the old ones, which, far from having any appearance of vigour and of youth, or a lively and freÅ¿h colour, look all Black, Å¿hriveled, and rugged, and worn out, and therefore we are only to eÅ¿teem thoÅ¿e which are freÅ¿h and new, and that we find at the Å¿ame time well pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                        <p>And theÅ¿e young ones are to be kept Å¿hort proportionably to their length, the longeÅ¿t <note place="margin">Of what length the good Roots are to be left in <hi>Dwarfs, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,</hi> &amp;c.</note> in <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> of what bigneÅ¿s Å¿oever it be, which is commonly not very great, never being to exceed eight or nine Inches, nor much above a foot in <hi>Standards:</hi> We may leave a greater length the roots of <hi>Mulberry</hi> and <hi>Almond-Trees,</hi> becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t are very Å¿oft, and thoÅ¿e of the Å¿econd, very dry and hard, and therefore will be in danger of periÅ¿hing, if they be cut too Å¿hort.</p>
                        <p>After we have fixed the length of the biggeÅ¿t roots of our Fruit-Trees, I am to tell you, that the length of two or three, or four Inches will Å¿erve for the leÅ¿Å¿er and feebler ones, and that proportionably to the bigneÅ¿s of each, the leaÅ¿t being always to be the Å¿horteÅ¿t; and here as I have elÅ¿ewhere told you, we muÅ¿t uÅ¿e a quite contrary method to that we practiÅ¿e in the pruning of the <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One Å¿ingle rank or Å¿tory of roots is enough, and I make more account of two or three roots well placed, than of twenty midling ones. I term roots to be well placed, when being round about the Tree foot, they are like Å¿o many lines drawn from the center to the Circumference.</p>

And I would have all my Trees, as near as poÅ¿Å¿ible, Å¿o prepared, that without being planted they may be able to Å¿tand upright of themÅ¿elves like Å¿o many nine-pins, and eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Å¿uch as are deÅ¿igned for <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Standards</hi> to grow in the open Air; for to plant againÅ¿t <hi>Walls,</hi> becauÅ¿e we muÅ¿t keep them always a little bending forward and that it is not convenient there Å¿hould be any root turned towards the <hi>Wall,</hi> we muÅ¿t entirely cut away all thoÅ¿e we find turned that way, and which in appearance were the worÅ¿t, for having occaÅ¿ion to preÅ¿erve the beÅ¿t, to be Å¿ure I always retrench thoÅ¿e that were the worÅ¿t qualified, and moÅ¿t inconveniently placed.</p>
                        <p>Methinks theÅ¿e Maximes are eaÅ¿ie to be underÅ¿tood, and are Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to practiÅ¿e, that any man that has but Å¿een a Tree prepared according to their preÅ¿cription, as 'tis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented in the figures therewith inÅ¿erted, may be able to prepare all Å¿orts of Trees, and eÅ¿pecially of thoÅ¿e Å¿orts that are not very prickly, as <hi>Quince-Trees, Plum-Trees, Wildings</hi> of the <hi>Woods,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>I likewiÅ¿e thought it very convenient to have them drawn too, in the Å¿tate they were in, while they were Å¿hooting out the new roots they produce after replanting, that every one might Å¿ee what a Tree well prepared and well planted Å¿hould do, to thrive and Å¿ucceed well, and wherein it may have been faulty if it proÅ¿pers not.</p>
                        <p>And when I have done all that I think fitting to the roots, then I endeavour diÅ¿creetly to judge what depth the loweÅ¿t roots require in the Ground, and what quantity of earth the higheÅ¿t roots muÅ¿t have laid over them; for they muÅ¿t be Å¿ecured, and put out of the reach, as well of the Injuries of the Air, as of the delving tools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then I determine of what length or height the Tree muÅ¿t be above Ground, that I may have no occaÅ¿ion to touch it any more after 'tis planted; for we muÅ¿t needs Å¿hake and looÅ¿en it when we let alone cutting it till after 'tis planted, and that Å¿haking Å¿eems to me to be very dangerous to the Tree.</p>
                        <p>We need not fear the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> will do any harm to the place where the Tree is cut off, and Å¿hortned, there aÅ¿Å¿uredly never hap'ning any inconvenience that way, as I can maintain to you by certain experience which you may venture to believe upon my word.

                           </note> is to be regulated as follows. If they be little, and to be planted in a dry Soil, they muÅ¿t be allowed Å¿ix or Å¿even Inches, becauÅ¿e that in <hi>Summer,</hi> their head or top may be able to skreen their foot or rooting, from the burning heat of the <hi>Sun;</hi> In moiÅ¿t Grounds, they may have ten, or eleven, or twelve at moÅ¿t, that their head or top may not too much hinder the heat from imparting its influence to the foot or root which there has need of it: As for the height of the Bodies of <hi>Standards,</hi> that is always to be about Å¿ix or Å¿even Inches in all Å¿orts of Grounds; for taller ones would be too apt to be Å¿haken or torn up by the roots by the Winds, and Å¿horter would be unpleaÅ¿ing to the Å¿ight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s it were a whole entire <hi>Plantation</hi> of <hi>Half Standards,</hi> as is often practiÅ¿ed for <hi>Plum-Trees, Cherry-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE firÅ¿t thing to be obÅ¿erved here, is, that in the Å¿eaÅ¿on of planting, which as all the world knows, laÅ¿ts from the end of <hi>October,</hi> to the middle of <hi>March,</hi> that is, from the time that the Trees quit their Leaves, till they are almoÅ¿t ready to begin to put forth new ones, we muÅ¿t chooÅ¿e dry, and mild weather, without troubling our heads to take any notice of the Age of the <hi>Moon,</hi> as formerly was practiÅ¿ed, rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not only incommodious to the Gard'ner in his Work, but alÅ¿o hurtful to the Trees that are then planted, becauÅ¿e the mold is then too apt to be reduced to a mortar-like conÅ¿iÅ¿tance, which makes it not Å¿o proper to Å¿ettle all cleverly down round about, and cloÅ¿e to the roots without leaving Å¿ome hollow between, which it is very expedient to prevent. Now, though all thoÅ¿e months be equally fit to plant in, Å¿o that it may Å¿eem, the Å¿ooner it be done, the better, yet as I willingly affect to plant preÅ¿ently after <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemas,</hi> in dry and light Grounds, Å¿o I care not to plant neither till the end of <hi>February,</hi> in cold and moiÅ¿t ones; becauÅ¿e the Trees in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t can do nothing all <hi>Winter,</hi> and may more likely be Å¿poiled there, than be able to preÅ¿erve themÅ¿elves, whereas in ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grounds, they may begin even that very Å¿ame <hi>Autumn,</hi> to Å¿hoot out Å¿ome Å¿mall roots, which is a great advance to them to put them in the way of doing wonders in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Spring.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd obÅ¿ervation is, that we are to regulate exactly all the diÅ¿tances which are to be between one Tree and another, whether they be <hi>Wall-Trees, Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Standards,</hi> that we may know perfectly both the number of Trees to be planted in general, and how many there are to be of every particular kind.</p>
                        <p>The third is, to regulate exactly the places to be aÅ¿Å¿igned both to each Å¿ort of Tree, and to each particular Tree, I liking beÅ¿t that all the Fruits of the Å¿ame Å¿eaÅ¿on, Å¿hould be placed in the Å¿ame <hi>Canton,</hi> or <hi>Parcel</hi> of Ground.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is, to make even by a line, holes about the wideneÅ¿s and form of a hat; for I Å¿uppoÅ¿e trenches to be well made, and if Å¿o, the Hole, though little, will be big <note place="margin">The fourth to make convenient <hi>Holes,</hi> or <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> to plant them in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> enough to plant the Tree in, and it would be but time, expence, and Labour loÅ¿t, to make it bigger.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is to order every Tree to be carried and laid near its hole, before we begin to plant any of them; and if there be occaÅ¿ion to plant any <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> about any Squares, or to form a <hi>Quincunce,</hi> I would have the faireÅ¿t, and beÅ¿t qualified placed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at the corners of the Å¿everal Squares, or Ranks, and likewiÅ¿e in Wall-plantations. It's moÅ¿t convenient always to plant the Å¿ineÅ¿t Trees, and thoÅ¿e that bear the fineÅ¿t Fruits, in the moÅ¿t eminent places, and the moÅ¿t viÅ¿ited, as, near the <hi>Gates,</hi> and along thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruit Walls</hi> near the faireÅ¿t <hi>Walks.</hi>

                        <p>Yet though I here make choice of the faireÅ¿t, it do's not follow that we are never to plant any but Å¿uch as are fair, and accompanied with all the hopeful appearances of thriving; Though it be true enough that after we have taken all the care we can to chooÅ¿e none but Å¿ine ones, yet Å¿ome of them will be always Å¿iner than the others.</p>
                        <p>The Trees then being all carried and laid every one near its aÅ¿Å¿igned place, if we be to plant <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> I begin with the corners of each Square, that they may Å¿erve to <note place="margin">The Author's Method of <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</note> guide us to place the others direct in the Å¿ame Lines; and if the Soil has been new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dug up and moved, and mixed with a good quantity of long dung, Å¿o that it Å¿eems not to be Å¿o firm and cloÅ¿e as it Å¿hould be, I take care to Å¿ink my Trees but about half <note place="margin">Of What <hi>Depth</hi> Trees are to be planted.</note> a foot, meaning that the extreamity of the loweÅ¿t root of the Tree is but half a foot deep in the Earth, becauÅ¿e as I reckon, the Ground will Å¿ink at leaÅ¿t half a foot; and becauÅ¿e it is better to plant too high, than two low, at the end of Å¿ome months, my Trees will be found Å¿unk about a foot into the Earth, which is the juÅ¿teÅ¿t meaÅ¿ure we can aÅ¿Å¿ign them in that reÅ¿pect, Trees planted deeper, almoÅ¿t always dying in a few years.</p>
                        <p>When I have planted the corner Trees, then I place a man at that rank I have a mind to plant, to adjuÅ¿t the Trees with a line, that they may be Å¿ure to be planted in a right line, and I take another man with a Å¿pade to cover up the roots of the Trees as faÅ¿t as I preÅ¿ent them in their places, and be informed by my line manager that they are right in the line, and Å¿o in one morning I will plant four or five hundred <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> with eaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48210:123"/>
It is yet more eaÅ¿ie to plant in a little time a great many <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> becauÅ¿e there is no need of uÅ¿ing a line; but in forming a <hi>Quincunce,</hi> we cannot go Å¿o faÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e that, as every Tree muÅ¿t anÅ¿wer exactly to two ranks, there muÅ¿t be two <hi>Aliners,</hi> viz. one for each rank, and there is always Å¿ome time loÅ¿t before the Tree can be placed Å¿o exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as equally to anÅ¿wer two Å¿everal ranks.</p>
                        <p>And we muÅ¿t not only be careful to plant our Trees a little high, and very Å¿traight, but we muÅ¿t be particularly mindful to turn their principal roots towards the good Soil; this being the moÅ¿t important point of all; Å¿o that though it be much to be deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all Trees deÅ¿igned for <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> Å¿hould appear Å¿traight upright upon their feet, after they are planted; yet if the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of their Roots which perhaps naturally incline to Pirot, or Å¿pread round, require that the Tree Å¿hould be a little Å¿tooped, to give that good Å¿ituation to its Roots which I deÅ¿ire they Å¿hould have, that is, to give them Å¿cope to Å¿pread rather between two Earths, than to Å¿hoot right downward, I not only make no difficulty to hold the head or the top of the Tree a little Å¿tooped, and that always over the line that is Å¿tretched out by it, but I counÅ¿el it as a thing neceÅ¿Å¿ary; otherwiÅ¿e, the roots that Å¿hoot from Å¿uch a Tree, being naturally inclined to follow the bent of thoÅ¿e out of which they Å¿prout, it will happen, that thoÅ¿e roots being forced to Å¿hoot downwards as low as the bad mold towards the bottom, or beyond the reach of the rain water, the Tree will thereupon grow Å¿ick, and languiÅ¿h, and will make an ill-favoured figure, and bring but Å¿curvy Fruit, and will at laÅ¿t die.</p>
                        <p>From what I have Å¿aid of the good Å¿ituation of the roots, it follows that if we be to plant any Trees along by the Å¿ides of any Walk or Alley, we muÅ¿t take care to avoid turning the principal roots towards the Alley Å¿ide, and with much greater reaÅ¿on, ought we to do the Å¿ame when we are planting <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and to take Å¿pecial care we leave not any good root of them, in vain to Å¿pend its force and vigour againÅ¿t the Walls.</p>
                        <p>This Å¿tooping of the head in low Trees, need not raiÅ¿e in us any Å¿curple, or put us in any apprehenÅ¿ion of Å¿poiling the beauty either of their figure in particular, or of that of the whole plantation in general, becauÅ¿e it is not the Å¿ame caÅ¿e with Branches that are to Å¿pring forth, as 'tis with roots; for the Branches do not at all follow the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Å¿tooping head; on the contrary, they grow regularly upright round about their trunk, and Å¿o becauÅ¿e their riÅ¿e is very near the Ground, their Trees make as a well Å¿haped figure, as if they had been planted upright upon their center.</p>
                        <p>It is the Å¿tandard Trees that are to grow in the full air, that we are neceÅ¿Å¿arily oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to plant as upright upon their center as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible; for otherwiÅ¿e their Trunks would always remain Å¿tanding awry, and conÅ¿equently would make an unÅ¿eemly figure, and beÅ¿ides would be more Å¿ubject to the inÅ¿ults of violent winds, and be apt to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by them; and therefore for that Å¿ame conÅ¿ideration, they muÅ¿t be planted a little deeper than other Trees, that is, they muÅ¿t be placed a full foot deep in the Ground, and though I caution people not to trample over the Ground where our Å¿mall Trees are planted, for fear of making them Å¿ink too deep, and becauÅ¿e they are in no danger of the Winds, on the contrary, I adviÅ¿e them to preÅ¿s the Ground as hard and cloÅ¿e as as they can, againÅ¿t the feet of theÅ¿e Standards, to faÅ¿ten them, and make them the firmer to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the violence of the winds.</p>
                        <p>After the planting of every Tree, if I have the convenience of any dung-hills, I put a bed of two or three Inches thick of dung over every Tree foot, and cover it over at <note place="margin">The uÅ¿e of Dung about Trees.</note> the Å¿ame time with a little Mold, to hide it from being Å¿een, as being no handÅ¿ome Å¿ight.</p>
                        <p>This bed of dung is not Å¿o much to improve the Ground, which I Å¿uppoÅ¿e already to be good, and well prepared, as particularly to hinder the burning heat of the Months of <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> from penetrating to their roots, and by conÅ¿equence from putting them out of due temper, and hindering them from performing their function, which would cauÅ¿e no leÅ¿s than the death of the Trees.</p>
                        <p>If I want dung, I content my Å¿elf during thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t dangerous Months, to cover the feet of my Trees with a bed of Weeds, or Fern; I hinder any thing from growing there <note place="margin">A bed of Weeds or fern may Å¿erve in want of Dung. In very dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every 15 days in the hot months.</note> that may Å¿hade or cloud the young Å¿hoots, and if there be a great drought, as it often happens, I order a pitcher of water to be poured upon each Tree foot, every fifteen days during the three or four hot Months, making firÅ¿t a kind of circular trench round the Tree that the water may pierce quite down to it, and when the water is all imbibed, I fill and make up this circle again, even with the reÅ¿t of the Ground, Å¿o that 'tis not diÅ¿cerned.</p>
                        <p>

But if the Å¿eaÅ¿on prove rainy, thoÅ¿e waterings will not be neceÅ¿Å¿ary. And after all theÅ¿e preparations, and precautions, yet we commonly think our Å¿elves happy enough if we can Stock our plantations Å¿o well, as to have but few Trees miÅ¿carry under our conduct.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>BUT notwithÅ¿tanding all this, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome Trees may happen to die, and yet as far as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible, it is to be deÅ¿ired, our plantation Å¿hould be compleated the very firÅ¿t year, I uÅ¿e to prepare a greater number of Trees than I have actually need of to fill up my plantation, that I may always have Å¿ome as 'twere in a Body of <hi>ReÅ¿erve,</hi> and for that purpoÅ¿e, it is my practiÅ¿e at the Å¿ame time I am filling up my plantations, to plant Å¿ome Supernumenary Trees of every kind in <hi>OÅ¿ier CaÅ¿es,</hi> or <hi>Baskets,</hi> but more of <hi>Stone,</hi> than of <hi>Kernel Fruits,</hi> becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e former moÅ¿t commonly are in greater hazard of dying than the others.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly I chuÅ¿e out Å¿ome good place in the <hi>Garden,</hi> (the moÅ¿t Å¿hady parts of it being the moÅ¿t proper for this effect) and there I plant Å¿ome Trees in <hi>OÅ¿ier Baskets,</hi> well ticketed, or at leaÅ¿t carefully Å¿et down in my Book according to the order both of their Ranks, and of the reÅ¿pective places allotted to them in thoÅ¿e Ranks, that I may have recourÅ¿e to them, when any Tree Å¿hall happen to die or languiÅ¿h in its place; Being deÅ¿irous, if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible, that my plantation Å¿hould continue finiÅ¿hed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as well in its figure, as in the kinds of Trees, according to my firÅ¿t modelling of it.</p>
                        <p>In order to which, I keep in a leaning poÅ¿ture in the ReÅ¿ervatory Baskets thoÅ¿e Trees <note place="margin">How to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>This operation of the TranÅ¿porting of ReÅ¿erve Trees, may be done till Mid-Å¿ummer; and when we have a mind to go about it, we muÅ¿t firÅ¿t by way of preparation, water thoÅ¿e ReÅ¿erve Trees well that we deÅ¿ign to remove, (which probably will be the faireÅ¿t we have) and then move the Earth away neatly round about the Baskets, for fear of breaking the roots of the plants in caÅ¿e they have Å¿hot any beyond the compaÅ¿s of their Baskets; and we muÅ¿t ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        <p>Now when in removing theÅ¿e ReÅ¿erve Trees, we perceive any roots of them to have begun to Å¿hoot out of the Basket, we muÅ¿t firÅ¿t in placing it, be very careful to preÅ¿erve the points of thoÅ¿e new Roots, place them well, and Å¿upport them with good mold, cover them immediately, and ramm the Earth cloÅ¿e againÅ¿t the Basket, and then water the Ground pretty plentifully round about the Basket, to make the Earth next to it, cleave the cloÅ¿er about it, Å¿o as there may remain no hollow, which may be known by the waters not Å¿inking Å¿o haÅ¿tily when you pour it on the place as before; And this water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably neceÅ¿Å¿ary in what manner Å¿oever we remove our ReÅ¿erve Trees: And laÅ¿tly, on thoÅ¿e days when the Sun Å¿hines hot, we muÅ¿t cover the head of the Tree with Å¿traw Screens, till Å¿uch time as it begins to Å¿prout, and then we may begin to take them off a nights; But this laÅ¿t precaution is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary but when we Å¿ee any new roots Sprout out of the Basket, or when the Tree has been Å¿haken and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ened.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48210:124"/>
The Å¿ame care and caution we uÅ¿e in placing againÅ¿t Walls Trees thus brought up in ReÅ¿erve Baskets: We muÅ¿t practiÅ¿e too in placing the Å¿ame Å¿ort of Trees for <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Standards,</hi> and above all, we muÅ¿t have a Å¿pecial care to leave thoÅ¿e new roots as little as poÅ¿Å¿ible in the Air; otherwiÅ¿e they will preÅ¿ently grow Black, and conÅ¿equently die.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing elÅ¿e to add about this head, but only directions how to make theÅ¿e <note place="margin">How the Baskets muÅ¿t be made and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Baskets, which muÅ¿t be made purpoÅ¿ely, and Å¿o looÅ¿e wrought that you may Å¿ee through them, as well becauÅ¿e the roots of the plants may the more eaÅ¿ily grow through them, as that taking up leÅ¿s Å¿tuff, they may coÅ¿t Å¿o much the leÅ¿s, and beÅ¿ides when there is Å¿o much Å¿tuff as to make them too thick and impenetrable, it do's but harm. They muÅ¿t be made of the greeneÅ¿t and freÅ¿heÅ¿t gathered <hi>OÅ¿ter</hi> that is to be had, that being put quite green into the Earth, they may laÅ¿t the longer without Rotting, that is, at leaÅ¿t a whole Year; for thoÅ¿e that have been made any time, rot Å¿ooner. They muÅ¿t not be very deep, becauÅ¿e then they would be too troubleÅ¿ome to remove, eight or nine Inches depth is enough, that when they are Å¿et into the Ground as deep as till their brims be covered, we may have room enough to put into them firÅ¿t about four or five Inches depth of Mold, and then the Tree, and after that, cover their roots with a little quantity of Earth more; and we may in removing theÅ¿e ReÅ¿erve Trees with their Baskets, take off Å¿ome of the uppermoÅ¿t Mold, if we find them too cumberÅ¿ome to carry; But as I told you before, we muÅ¿t be very careful to ramm down the Earth cloÅ¿e about the Baskets, that there remain no chink or hollow.</p>
                        <p>As to the bigneÅ¿s of the Baskets, it muÅ¿t be proportionable to the length of the roots of the Trees we deÅ¿ign to plant in them: They muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t big enough to afford us room to put in three or four Inches depth of Mold between the ends of the roots, and the Brim of the Basket, Å¿o that for Trees deÅ¿igned for Wall <hi>Trees,</hi> the Baskets need not be Å¿o large as otherwiÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Trees are planted in them in a leaning poÅ¿ture, and therefore lie Å¿o near one Å¿ide, that all their roots are turned to the other, and Å¿o their new roots may find room enough provided the Basket be wide enough; But for Trees deÅ¿igned for <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> becauÅ¿e they muÅ¿t be planted in the middle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿hoot out roots round about them, the Baskets for them muÅ¿t be a little Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>The Baskets likewiÅ¿e for <hi>Standards,</hi> muÅ¿t be proportionably greater than for low Trees. I need not tell you, that the Baskets muÅ¿t be round, becauÅ¿e every Body knows that, though they might be made Oval or Square too, but then they would coÅ¿t more and be never a whit the better.</p>
                        <p>The Difference therefore of the BigneÅ¿s of Trees obliges us to make Baskets of three different Sizes, <hi>viz.</hi> Little ones of about a foot Diameter, Midling ones, of about fifteen or Å¿ixteen Inches, and Great ones, of about eighteen or twenty. The principal Quality moÅ¿t to be look'd after in them, is, that their bottom be Å¿trong and Å¿olid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear without burÅ¿ting, the weight of Earth to be charged upon them, and that the Edges both above and below be Å¿o well wrought as not to unravel; There muÅ¿t be alÅ¿o a Welt round about the middle for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on.</p>
                        <p>And I am not content to make uÅ¿e of this precaution of ReÅ¿erve-Trees at the time of my firÅ¿t planting any great plantations, but I practiÅ¿e it every year, for a certain finall number of Trees, according to the bigneÅ¿s of the plantation I have to cultivate, that when there happens any accident to any of the Trees placed in it, as there may happen many, I may remedy it aÅ¿Å¿oon as I am threat'ned with it, or aÅ¿Å¿oon as ever the accident happens; for in fine we Å¿hould always be in a condition to keep our plantation full and compleat without Å¿uffering any Tree in it that will not comply with our deÅ¿ign.</p>
                        <p>A little coÅ¿t will put our minds at eaÅ¿e in this reÅ¿pect; and for want of that, we may loÅ¿e much time and pleaÅ¿ure too.</p>
                        <p>It is now time for us to proceed to the MaÅ¿ter Work of Gard'ners, which is Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                        <p>This CuÅ¿tom of <hi>Pruning</hi> does not commonly extend to all Å¿orts of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> only to Å¿uch as are known in <hi>Gardens</hi> by the Names of <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Fruit-Trees, Counter-EÅ¿paliers</hi> or <hi>Pole-Hedges</hi> and <hi>Dwarfs.</hi> As for thoÅ¿e that are called <hi>Tall-Å¿tandards,</hi> they are Å¿eldom <hi>prun'd,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be once or twice in their firÅ¿t Years, either to give them the firÅ¿t Turn of a Round Figure, and Overture, which is requiÅ¿ite at the time they firÅ¿t begin to form an Head; or to take away Å¿ome irregular <hi>Branches,</hi> which in proceÅ¿s of Time might intangle or diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure that Head; which <hi>Pruning</hi> is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary. A kind of <hi>Pruning</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e practis'd upon very old <hi>Tall-Å¿tandards,</hi> by cutting off the dead or languiÅ¿hing <hi>Branches,</hi> both large and Å¿mall; but that is rather called <hi>CleanÅ¿ing,</hi> or <hi>DiÅ¿-incumbring,</hi> than <hi>Pruning.</hi>

Although the firÅ¿t <hi>Idea</hi> People have of <hi>Pruning,</hi> is commonly in relation to the Heads of <hi>Trees,</hi> that is, their <hi>Branches,</hi> which frequently want Å¿ome Correction, to be put in a way of doing well, according to the Mind of their MaÅ¿ter; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding, there is Å¿till another <hi>Trimming</hi> which is very material, and that is the <hi>Trimming</hi> of <hi>Roots;</hi> which is perform'd upon two OccaÅ¿ions; of which, the one, that is the moÅ¿t common, is generally practis'd upon all <hi>Trees,</hi> before they are planted; (which I have Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently mention'd in the TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Plantations:)</hi> The other, which is extraordinary, is only made uÅ¿e of upon Å¿ome on the Place, according as one deÅ¿igns to make Å¿ome more, and others leÅ¿s vigorous than they are. This I will Å¿peak of at the End of this TreatiÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>This Maxim, or NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of <hi>Pruning</hi> the Heads of all <hi>Trees,</hi> not being <hi>Tall-Å¿tandards,</hi> being well eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, tho there are Å¿ome Erroneous Opinions in it, in relation to very vigorous <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> which I Å¿hall eaÅ¿ily deÅ¿troy. I think my Å¿elf indiÅ¿penÅ¿ibly oblig'd to examine here, as much as in me lies, whatever relates to Å¿o renown'd a Practice in the Management of <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> therefore I proteÅ¿t, at firÅ¿t, that I will make no particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve to my Å¿elf; but on the contrary, that I will uÅ¿e my utmoÅ¿t Endeavour, not to omit any thing whatever of what I have been able to apprehend in it hitherto, and of what I have Å¿o long practis'd with SucceÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>I am perÅ¿uaded that <hi>Pruning</hi> is not only a very uÅ¿eful, but alÅ¿o a very curious thing, and capable of affording PleaÅ¿ure to thoÅ¿e that underÅ¿tand it: But at the Å¿ame time it muÅ¿t be acknowledg'd, that it is likewiÅ¿e perpicious, or dangerous, when perform'd by unskilful Hands.</p>
                        <p>For, to Å¿peak properly, <hi>Pruning,</hi> in the SenÅ¿e we take it, is not barely Cutting; every <note place="margin">Qui cum judicio putat Arborem, efficit, ut quod Arbor Å¿ponte vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit facere, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To let you underÅ¿tand what this <hi>Pruning</hi> is; I Å¿ay, that it is an Operation of <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> for three Things, which are to be done yearly to <hi>Trees,</hi> betwixt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Month of <hi>November,</hi> and the End of <hi>March:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The FirÅ¿t is, To take away all thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> that are naught, or might be prejudicial, either to the Abundance, or GoodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Fruit;</hi> as alÅ¿o to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second, To preÅ¿erve all thoÅ¿e that may be of good uÅ¿e to thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the Third, Prudently to clip thoÅ¿e that are found too long, and not to cut any thing off thoÅ¿e that have not too much length.</p>
                        <p>And all this in order to make a <hi>Tree</hi> laÅ¿ting, to beautifie it, and at the Å¿ame time diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e it Å¿oon to bear a great deal of fine and good <hi>Fruit.</hi>

                        <p>By <hi>Branches</hi> that may be of good UÅ¿e, I mean all thoÅ¿e that are Å¿o well condition'd, as to be fit to contribute to the beautiful Figure of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and Infallibly to produce <hi>Fruit.</hi>

                        <p>By <hi>Branches</hi> that are too long, I mean Å¿uch as exceed nine or ten Inches in length, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently want to be Å¿horten'd; Å¿uch are all the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> which we call <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> and Å¿ome of the Å¿mall ones, which we call <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit.</hi>

In fine, By <hi>Branches</hi> that have not too much length, I mean certain little <hi>Branches,</hi> which being of a moderate ThickneÅ¿s, have <hi>Buds</hi> at the Ends of them, or are in a DiÅ¿poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having Å¿ome the following Year, and yet are Å¿trong enough to bear the Fruit they are to produce, without breaking.</p>
                        <p>This Å¿o material DiÅ¿tinction in point of <hi>Branches,</hi> Å¿hall be more particularly explain'd in the Chapters that treat of the Manner of <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will Å¿ay nothing here of the Original of <hi>Pruning,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that what has been Å¿aid of it is fabulous, and ridiculous, and conÅ¿equently cannot at preÅ¿ent Å¿erve for InÅ¿truction. For Example, What Å¿ignifies it to know, that Å¿ome pretend to derive the Original of <hi>Pruning</hi> from that Province of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was called <hi>Nauptia;</hi> a Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in <hi>Vineyards:</hi> An AÅ¿s having brouz'd or nibbl'd Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> it was obÅ¿erv'd that the nibbl'd <hi>Branches</hi> produc'd a great many more <hi>Grapes,</hi> than thoÅ¿e that were untouch'd; which made them reÅ¿olve thenceforward to Å¿horten, or break, or cut, that is, to <hi>prune</hi> all the Branches of <hi>Vines.</hi> It is moreover reported, that Å¿o much SucceÅ¿s attended this Experiment, that to expreÅ¿s their Acknowledgment of Å¿o fine an Invention, they erected in one of the fineÅ¿t Places of that Province, a Marble Statue to that Animal, as to the Author of <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, to the Author of the Abundance of Wine. And our Books tell us, that this is the true ReaÅ¿on of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s being drawn mounted upon an AÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>The UÅ¿efulneÅ¿s of <hi>Pruning</hi> Vines being viÅ¿ible; it was judg'd from thence, that it would not be leÅ¿s advantageous to <hi>prune Fruit-Trees;</hi> and thus, in the Beginnings, they did in this, as has been done in all other Arts and Sciences, they begun to cut groÅ¿ly, that is, to <hi>prune</hi> Å¿ome of the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> till by degrees they have Å¿tudy'd to refine upon it; and, even in theÅ¿e Days, People Å¿till Å¿tudy, by ReaÅ¿on and ObÅ¿ervation, to improve, and render themÅ¿elves more and more perfect in it. This is the Information we receive from Books, as to the Original of <hi>Pruning:</hi> It will eaÅ¿ily be granted, that this is not a very material Thing. But, What is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be known,</p>
                        <p>Are three principal Points; without the underÅ¿tanding of which, it Å¿eems impoÅ¿Å¿ible to me, either to Å¿peak well of this <hi>Pruning,</hi> or to perform it.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The FirÅ¿t relates to the ReaÅ¿ons for which it is done.</item>

                           <item>And the Third relates to the Manner of doing it with Skill and SucceÅ¿s.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Let us examine theÅ¿e three Points, one after another.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="chapter">

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the ReaÅ¿ons of Pruning.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Will begin with the ReaÅ¿ons for which <hi>Pruning</hi> is uÅ¿ed, which, in my Opinion, are two. The FirÅ¿t, and chief, is, That which <hi>Pruning</hi> aims at, The Å¿peedy getting of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fine and good <hi>Fruit;</hi> without which, no <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> would be had, or culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
                        <p>The Second, which is pretty conÅ¿iderable, informs us, That <hi>Pruning</hi> Å¿erves to make <hi>Trees,</hi> in all SeaÅ¿ons, even in thoÅ¿e in which they have neither <hi>Fruit</hi> nor <hi>Leaves,</hi> appear more agreeable to Sight, than they would do if they were not <hi>prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, the Satisfaction of the Sight in this laÅ¿t Point depends wholly upon the well-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood, and well-proportion'd Figure, a skilful Hand is capable of giving to each <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, as to what relates to the Abundance of fine and good <hi>Fruit,</hi> as much as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duÅ¿try of the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> can contribute to it, it depends firÅ¿t upon the Knowledge he muÅ¿t have of every <hi>Branch</hi> in particular, to know thoÅ¿e that are good, from thoÅ¿e that are not: It depends, in the Å¿econd place, upon the judicious DiÅ¿tinction which is to be made among the <hi>Branches,</hi> wholly to take away thoÅ¿e that are bad, or uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and carefully to preÅ¿erve all the good ones, be they <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit;</hi> with this caution, that if among theÅ¿e laÅ¿t, Å¿ome be found not too long, they Å¿hall be left as they are: But as to the main, of the others which are too long, they muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> more or leÅ¿s, according as ReaÅ¿on may require, either as to the Abundance, or even to the Figure of the <hi>Tree.</hi> This abundance depends, in the third Place, upon the proper time of <hi>Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> all times not being fit for it.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the two firÅ¿t Heads, which relate to the Knowledge and DiÅ¿tinction of <hi>Branches</hi> in general, I Å¿hall Å¿hew hereafter in what Order, and to what UÅ¿e Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them upon <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> how Å¿ome are uÅ¿eful for one thing, others for another, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48210:129"/>
chiefly how Å¿ome have more DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition to Fructify, and others leÅ¿s; and Å¿hall conclude from thence, that it is according to that Order, and that Intention of Nature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that more or leÅ¿s DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be Order'd and <hi>Prun'd</hi> in a different manner, the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>But before I enter any farther into that matter, which has a great extent, Å¿ince I muÅ¿t therein explain, eÅ¿pecially the Manner, or Rules that muÅ¿t be practis'd in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of a great number of <hi>Trees,</hi> which commonly are very different the one from the other; I think, it will not be improper to Å¿ay firÅ¿t, and as briefly as I can, what I think of the Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> Å¿ince that Article is Å¿ooneÅ¿t decided.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THere is but little to be Å¿aid upon the Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> becauÅ¿e that by a general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, it is commonly fix'd to the End of Winter, or at the Beginning of the Spring; that is, a little before the <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿prout, and partly about the time that the <hi>Buds</hi> begin to Å¿well, in order to become <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> and the others to Å¿tretch out to become Branches: Which happens infallibly, after the great Colds (which generally attend the Months of <hi>November, December, January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> are paÅ¿t;) the Spring coming in, and conÅ¿equently the Air beginning to grow hot, and mild, the <hi>Plants,</hi> that had wholly ceas'd to act during four Months, begin, as it were, to waken, and really to enter into Action: That firÅ¿t Motion is conÅ¿tantly perform'd at the Head, before it begins at the <hi>Roots;</hi> that is to be underÅ¿tood, when the Cold has been Å¿o great, as to interrupt their Function; for among us, in mild Winters, there is not much more Interruption, than in very hot Countries. We Å¿hall Å¿hew this Order in another place. This External Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Action is a certain Sign that it is time to <hi>prune.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>People were formerly Å¿o Å¿crupulous as to the preciÅ¿e Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> that they durÅ¿t not abÅ¿olutely labour about it, but in the DecreaÅ¿e of the Moons of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March:</hi> It was almoÅ¿t the only Maxim, in that CaÅ¿e, that appear'd well eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, and was in effect inviolably obÅ¿erved. It may be Å¿aid, that it was a kind of Rote, which moÅ¿t <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> affected with an incredible ObÅ¿tinacy; or rather, that it was a kind of Tyranny, which they exercis'd, when they were employ'd by Gentlemen who were Lovers of their <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> That CuÅ¿tom was grown to that heighth, that both the one and the other would have thought all loÅ¿t, had any thing been <hi>prun'd</hi> out of thoÅ¿e Declinings: It was an Epidemical DiÅ¿temper; of which, there are Å¿till but too many ill Remains. I grant that in other things that are above my Reach, and in which I have no InÅ¿ight, it may be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to obÅ¿erve the Motions of the Moon; but as to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has any relation to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> I will take upon me to Å¿hew hereafter, in a TreatiÅ¿e of Å¿ome Reflections I have made upon <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that thoÅ¿e ObÅ¿ervations are not only vain, but even Chimerical. And whereas I was formerly infected with that Opinion my Å¿elf, and am now fully diÅ¿abus'd of it, I do not deÅ¿pair of ridding <hi>Gard'ners</hi> of that kind of Notion, or Ignorance, and at the Å¿ame time cure the DiÅ¿quiets of Å¿everal ingenious Men upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that it is very good to <hi>prune</hi> at the End of <hi>February,</hi> and at the Beginning <note place="margin">Omnis Arborum putatio quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque fieri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t Ã  tempore caÅ¿us foliorum. <hi>CreÅ¿centius.</hi>
                           </note> of <hi>March,</hi> which are commonly Times of DecreaÅ¿e; but it is likewiÅ¿e as true, that without minding the Moon, one may begin to <hi>prune</hi> as Å¿oon as the Leaves of the <hi>Trees</hi> are faln; that is, at the End of <hi>October,</hi> or, at leaÅ¿t, about the Middle of <hi>November;</hi> which may be continu'd afterwards for the whole Winter, until all be done. And, becauÅ¿e that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly three Å¿orts of <hi>Trees</hi> to <hi>prune;</hi> the one too weak, the other too vigorous, and the others that are in as good a CaÅ¿e as can be deÅ¿ir'd, I am of Opinion that it may be both prudent and uÅ¿eful, not to <hi>prune</hi> them all at the Å¿ame time; and that it is proper to <hi>prune</hi> Å¿ome Å¿ooner, and others later. For Example, I am Å¿ufficiently perÅ¿uaded, that the weaker, and more languiÅ¿hing a <hi>Tree</hi> is, the Å¿ooner it ought to be <hi>prun'd,</hi> to take from it betimes thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> which, as noiÅ¿om and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, muÅ¿t be taken from it at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; that is, towards the End of the Winter. And this is the ReaÅ¿on why the <hi>Pruning</hi> in <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>January</hi> is very good and wholeÅ¿om in relation to theÅ¿e; and even better than that of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi> And, by the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, the Å¿tronger and more vigorous a <hi>Tree</hi> is, the longer the <hi>Pruning</hi> of it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd; I mean, as to Å¿uch an one, that the <hi>Pruning</hi> of it may not only Å¿afely, but alÅ¿o very uÅ¿efully be deferr'd until the End of <hi>April.</hi>

I advance in this, two Principles, which appear pretty new: ThoÅ¿e that are deÅ¿irous to Å¿ee the certain Proof of it, may continue to read what follows: As for thoÅ¿e who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to rely upon my Word and Experience, and are only deÅ¿irous to Å¿ee the Sequel of my manner of PractiÅ¿ing, they may skip over the Remainder of this Chapter, to proceed to that wherein I explain the ReaÅ¿ons why <hi>Pruning</hi> is neceÅ¿Å¿ary.</p>
                        <p>To eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the two Principles I have heretofore advanc'd, I make uÅ¿e of two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ons, whereof the firÅ¿t, which relates to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of weak <hi>Trees,</hi> is drawn from the Conduct of certain frugal Millers, who, with a Å¿mall quantity of Water, find the Means to manage a Mill that requires a great deal. The Second, which relates to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of very vigorous <hi>Trees,</hi> is taken from other Millers, who knowing how dangerous great Streams of RiÅ¿ing Waters are to their Mills, for a Time Å¿uffer the Abundance of Water; which might annoy them, to flow gently by; and the Violence of it being over, they Å¿hut their Sluce, or Water-gate, and afterwards employ the Remainder of their Water; according as may be expedient for the Number of Wheels they are to ply.</p>
                        <p>For the UnderÅ¿tanding of theÅ¿e two CompariÅ¿ons, I Å¿ay, that the <hi>Sap</hi> in every <hi>Tree</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be partly the Å¿ame as Water is in every River: I will Å¿ay in another place, what Water is in the Pipes of Å¿pouting Fountains.</p>
                        <p>Whether Rivers be large or Å¿mall, it is Å¿till certain that they are beautiful, provided that the Channel of each, whatever it may be, be commonly furniÅ¿h'd with a quantity of Water proportionable to it; without which, they are miÅ¿erable, and of no ConÅ¿ideration: So is a <hi>Tree</hi> likewiÅ¿e eÅ¿teem'd beautiful, whatever Size it be of, (there being both Great and Small,) provided that <hi>Tree</hi> yearly produces Å¿ufficient fine <hi>Å¿hoots;</hi> from all its Parts; and in quantity, proportionable to its preÅ¿ent heighth and thickneÅ¿s, or bulk; without which, a <hi>Tree</hi> is certainly both ugly and miÅ¿erable.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that while a <hi>Tree</hi> is in a good <hi>Ground,</hi> and well, the Weather not being Å¿o cold, as to freeze the <hi>Ground</hi> as far as the <hi>Roots;</hi> for Å¿uch a Cold Å¿tops all manner of <hi>vegetation;</hi> in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, the extremities of the old <hi>Roots,</hi> Å¿till produce other new ones, and conÅ¿equently Å¿till produce a new <hi>Sap,</hi> as I prove in my <hi>Reflections,</hi> and Å¿o there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually riÅ¿es a <hi>Sap,</hi> both into the <hi>Stem</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and in all the <hi>Branches</hi> which compoÅ¿e the head or top of it; and this, more or leÅ¿s in the whole extent of each, according as the <hi>Sap</hi> is in it Å¿elf more or leÅ¿s abounding; juÅ¿t as it is in a River, while the Source is good, and no ways obÅ¿tructed, the Water flows continually, not only in the Bed or Channel, which Art and Nature have provided for it, but alÅ¿o, generally into all the Branches into which it may divide it Å¿elf; that is to Å¿ay, into all the Brooks, or Rivulets, which may form themÅ¿elves along its courÅ¿e, and that more or leÅ¿s, according as that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in it Å¿elf more or leÅ¿s abounding.</p>
                        <p>When we find that a <hi>Tree</hi> has but little vigour, and produces no fine <hi>Shoots;</hi> or that having been vigorous the preceeding Years, it ceaÅ¿es to be Å¿o, Å¿o as to produce no more <hi>Shoots,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t, none but very Å¿mall and inconÅ¿iderable ones, we may Å¿ay that it is an Infallible mark, either, that the Source of the <hi>Sap</hi> is Naturally weak and Å¿mall, or that it is become Å¿o; Å¿o that being no longer capable of performing any effect in long <hi>Branches,</hi> nor in many, and yet it being neceÅ¿Å¿ary it Å¿hould produce Å¿ome for our Profit and Satisfaction; we muÅ¿t betimes eaÅ¿e that <hi>Tree</hi> of its burthen, which is too great, conÅ¿idering its want of Strength and Vigour, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently betimes, wholly cut off a great part of its <hi>Branches,</hi> to the end, that we may, as Å¿oon as poÅ¿Å¿ibly can be, Å¿top many of thoÅ¿e over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures through which part of the <hi>Sap</hi> of that <hi>Tree</hi> did enter; and Å¿o that, which for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, being divided into forty <hi>boughs</hi> Å¿eem'd to produce but little effect in each, the Å¿ame being afterwards contracted, and diÅ¿tributed into half the quantity, will be found Å¿ufficient to perform much greater Productions upon that <hi>Tree,</hi> tho' indeed leÅ¿s numerous: It was like a River, whoÅ¿e Source or Spring, was either Naturally weak, or conÅ¿iderably diminiÅ¿h'd, and which, notwithÅ¿tanding that being yet divided into too many <hi>Branches;</hi> could not perform any thing conÅ¿iderable in any of them; but the Å¿ame being induÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly contracted, or reduc'd, and kept within narrow bounds, Å¿o that for the future no part of it may be loÅ¿t, as it us'd to be; is thereby enabl'd, at leaÅ¿t to turn Å¿ome Wheel. A Dam, or Sluce made betimes, have perform'd in this, what the good Fortune of a more abounding River would have done, as to Å¿everal Wheels.</p>
                        <p>This ReaÅ¿on has induc'd me to advice the <hi>Pruning</hi> of weak <hi>Trees</hi> betimes, and the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿on informs us, that they muÅ¿t be cut very Å¿hort, as we will demonÅ¿trate hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Now, that which is a convincing Argument, in relation to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of theÅ¿e, muÅ¿t, in my Opinion, by the Rule of contraries, Å¿erve to direct us as to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> be it either to do it later, or to leave a greater burthen upon each of them.</p>
                        <p>It is moÅ¿t certain, that we only have <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> in order to have <hi>Fruit;</hi> and it is as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48210:130"/>
certain, that <hi>Fruit</hi> commonly grows upon thoÅ¿e weak <hi>Branches</hi> only; the large ones bear but little, their Function being to perform Å¿omething elÅ¿e, which is very conÅ¿iderable: Thus great Torrents are not fit to grind, on the contrary, they are apt to choak or Å¿top up a Mill, or to break all; their Function is to Å¿erve to other things; for inÅ¿tance, for the TranÅ¿portation of Travellers, Burthens, MerchandiÅ¿es, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that none but thoÅ¿e that are moderate, can be uÅ¿eful for Grinding; So likewiÅ¿e, a <hi>Tree</hi> being very vigorous, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally produces none but large <hi>Branches,</hi> eÅ¿pecially at the beginning of the Spring, at which time the <hi>Sap</hi> riÅ¿es moÅ¿t, and can begin none of thoÅ¿e weak ones, which we Å¿tand in need of for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> that muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> in order to yield <hi>Fruit,</hi> and yet retain a pleaÅ¿ing Figure; you muÅ¿t not only leave a great burthen, whether it be as to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Branches,</hi> or the length of every one of them, which is certainly abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary, but there muÅ¿t be Å¿omething more: And as it is particularly on thoÅ¿e extremities, that the new <hi>Sap</hi> performs moÅ¿t at the entrance of the Spring, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, as one may Å¿ay, to let the heat and fury of its firÅ¿t Action diÅ¿charge it Å¿elf: And therefore it is fit to <hi>Prune</hi> Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> later; that is, it muÅ¿t not be done until the firÅ¿t impetuoÅ¿ity of the <hi>Sap</hi> be paÅ¿s'd; there will yet remain enough in it, to make thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿o <hi>Prun'd,</hi> afterwards Å¿hoot out, at the Å¿ame time, both large <hi>Shoots</hi> for the Figure, and of thoÅ¿e Å¿mall ones which we deÅ¿ire for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Not but that, as I will Å¿hew hereafter, the beÅ¿t Expedient in relation to very vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> and even, if I may expreÅ¿s my Å¿elf Å¿o, obÅ¿tinate in point of <hi>Fruit;</hi> I Å¿ay, the beÅ¿t Expedient, is to go to the Source of their Vigour, which are the <hi>Roots:</hi> It is that Vigour which muÅ¿t be weaken'd, and conÅ¿equently the moÅ¿t working <hi>Roots:</hi> diminiÅ¿h'd, and thereby you will diminiÅ¿h the effect which proceeds from Å¿everal good Labourers; which acting at one and the Å¿ame time, produce more <hi>Sap</hi> than is requir'd to Å¿uch a <hi>Fruit-Tree:</hi> For, in fine, that <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t according to our intention, quickly bear <hi>Fruit</hi> in a conÅ¿train'd Figure, the which is in no wiÅ¿e Natural to it; which it cannot do, when the <hi>Sap,</hi> being over abundant, produces every where, none but over large <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Experience which every one may acquire in the practice of theÅ¿e two Maxims, and particularly that which relates to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of weak <hi>Trees;</hi> that Experience, I Å¿ay, will perfectly eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h them for ever; and as for other <hi>Trees,</hi> I engage that every body will find a benefit by it; and I affirm, above all things, that it will be a great help to all <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who are to mannage great <hi>Fruit-Gardens;</hi> and who, as it is very much to be wiÅ¿h'd, will <hi>Prune</hi> the greateÅ¿t part of their <hi>Trees</hi> themÅ¿elves.</p>
                        <p>As I am of Opinion, that they can do no better than to follow this Advice, Å¿o they appear to me very blame-worthy, if they tarry to the end of Winter, and the time of thoÅ¿e decreaÅ¿es of the Moons, of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> to begin to <hi>Prune;</hi> becauÅ¿e, that is the greateÅ¿t time of hurry for all manner of work relating to <hi>Gard'ners:</hi> All comes at once at the entrance of the Spring; the Tillage of the whole <hi>Garden,</hi> the Sowing of moÅ¿t <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> the Budding of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> the making of the different <hi>Beds,</hi> the cleanÅ¿ing of the Walks; Å¿o that it is a Å¿trange confuÅ¿ion, to have at the Å¿ame time, the moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable of all Works to do; for it is the only one, in which no Å¿mall faults can be committed, they are all conÅ¿iderable and pernicious; it is the <hi>Pruning</hi> of many <hi>Trees,</hi> and perhaps large <hi>Trees, Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> without omitting the firÅ¿t palliÅ¿ading of theÅ¿e; and whereas in that caÅ¿e, all things are done in a hurry, Å¿o they are commonly ill enough done: For to Å¿peak the Truth, every thing requiring an equal haÅ¿te to be done, there are but few to which a Man can give that time, and application, which they require.</p>
                        <p>I have Å¿aid by the by, that I did no ways matter the decreaÅ¿e of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have not anÅ¿wer'd an Objection which Å¿ome <hi>Gard'ners</hi> pretend to be invincible, and in which, in my Opinion, they are infinitely deceiv'd; it is, Å¿ay they, That the Winter FroÅ¿t may Å¿poil the extremities of the <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Prun'd;</hi> and that if it be not to be fear'd <hi>Å¿o much</hi> for <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> yet at leaÅ¿t it is very dangerous for <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the Wood of thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> is very tender, becauÅ¿e it is very pithy; I will only deÅ¿ire thoÅ¿e Å¿crupulous PerÅ¿ons, to lay aÅ¿ide that apprehenÅ¿ion, and I aÅ¿Å¿ure them, that the Experiment they will make of it, without prejudice, will fully cure them of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; we have had within theÅ¿e Seven or Eighth Years, the hardeÅ¿t Winters in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any Living Man. I had <hi>Prun'd</hi> my <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> before that great Cold, and I never found the leaÅ¿t inconveniency by it.</p>
                        <p>I am fully perÅ¿waded, that it is Å¿afe to <hi>Prune</hi> as often as the Cold is not Å¿o violent, as perÅ¿onally to prejudice the <hi>Pruner;</hi> there are only certain days of white or hoary FroÅ¿t, in which the Wood being altogether cover'd with a rimy FroÅ¿t, the <hi>Pruning-knife,</hi> tho' never Å¿o Å¿harp, cannot cut through it cleverly; and Å¿o, whereas a Man ought to <hi>Prune</hi>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48210:130"/>
with delight; to do it well, 'tis certainly impoÅ¿Å¿ible at that time, and therefore it is neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to defer <hi>Pruning,</hi> until that FroÅ¿t be altogether melted and gone.</p>
                        <p>The proper times for <hi>Pruning</hi> being regulated, we muÅ¿t proceed to Å¿omething more Material and Curious.</p>
                        <p>As nothing is more creditable and Natural for a Workman, than to know certainly, why, and for what ReaÅ¿on, he does the Work he is employ'd about; Å¿o I am perÅ¿waded, that nothing can be more Å¿tupid, and below a Man, than to Act barely by CuÅ¿tom, and Habit: It is a fault which is but too common amongÅ¿t moÅ¿t <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> they Å¿eldom <hi>Prune</hi> for any other ReaÅ¿on, than that it is cuÅ¿tomary. I am convinc'd that there is an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pencible NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of knowing Å¿omething more; without which, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible ever to attain to any perfection in <hi>Pruning,</hi> which in my Opinion is an undeniable Truth: I cannot endure that a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> Å¿hould be puzzl'd, and almoÅ¿t quite at a loÅ¿s, when any body deÅ¿ires to know the ReaÅ¿ons of his <hi>Pruning:</hi> And that is the Subject I intend to Treat of in the following Chapter.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the ReaÅ¿ons that oblige to <hi>Prune.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE have two principal ReaÅ¿ons, which PreÅ¿cribe and AuthoriÅ¿e <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The FirÅ¿t is, To be Å¿ure to have a greater abundance of fine Fruit, and Å¿ooner.</p>
                        <p>The Second is, To render the <hi>Tree</hi> at all times more agreeable to Å¿ight, than it would be, if it were not <hi>Prun'd:</hi> It is undeniable, that it is not only the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Leaves</hi> that render a <hi>Tree</hi> beautiful: They are indeed its greateÅ¿t Ornaments, but there is Å¿omething more requir'd; Å¿ince the <hi>Fruit</hi> not remaining upon it all the Year round, it were to be wiÅ¿h'd, that when it is Å¿tript of thoÅ¿e Adornments, or is not yet old enough to have them all; it may at leaÅ¿t be compos'd, and Å¿hap'd Å¿o, as to delight the Eye.</p>
                        <p>Now that which, beÅ¿ides the importance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> renders a <hi>Tree</hi> pleaÅ¿ing to the Eye, is nothing but the beautiful Figure a skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> can give to it: And whereas we have two Å¿orts of <hi>Trees,</hi> upon which particularly we ExerciÅ¿e <hi>Pruning,</hi> to wit <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> we muÅ¿t eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h good Principles to proceed prudently upon both: ThoÅ¿e Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples relate particularly to the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> without which we cannot have beautiful <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> and by means of which it is eaÅ¿ie, and even Infallible, to attain to a perfection in it; the whole MyÅ¿tery of that Operation, Å¿hall be diÅ¿cover'd in the Chapters that Treat of the manner of <hi>Pruning Dwarfs;</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> there being no other Rules for the one than for the other.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay firÅ¿t, That for thoÅ¿e two Å¿orts of <hi>Trees,</hi> it muÅ¿t be granted, that their Figures being Å¿o oppoÅ¿ite the one to the other, the Beauty conÅ¿equently muÅ¿t needs be Å¿o too, therefore I think it will not be amiÅ¿s, to Å¿hew in what, particularly, I faney, that thoÅ¿e two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind of Beauties may conÅ¿iÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>And perhaps, after that, it will not be improper to compare, in that reÅ¿pect, a good <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> to a skilful <hi>Carver;</hi> For as the latter, conformably to the Idea which fills his Imagination, ought at firÅ¿t Å¿ight, to behold in his Marble, the Figure he deÅ¿igns to work out of it, and conÅ¿equently to behold diÅ¿tinctly in it, the place of every particular Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which it is to be compos'd.</p>
                        <p>So an UnderÅ¿tanding <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> conformably to the Idea he Å¿hall have fram'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf of a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> muÅ¿t at a view behold whatever is to be done in any Tree, either to beautifie it, when it is not Å¿o, or to preÅ¿erve it in its Beauty, when it has acquir'd it; whether it be to render it uÅ¿eful; or, for Example, to Å¿ee where the <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿hall be, and conÅ¿equently the <hi>Branches</hi> that Å¿hall produce it; to obÅ¿erve the <hi>Branches</hi> that muÅ¿t be taken off, and thoÅ¿e that muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd, to give it an agreeable Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as from time to time, the <hi>Carver</hi> draws back from his Work, to Å¿ee whether he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd or executed his Thought well; Å¿o a skilful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> in <hi>Pruning</hi> his <hi>Tree,</hi> ought to do the Å¿ame thing; that is, to draw back from it, from time to time, to Å¿ee whether he has really hit upon the beautiful Figure he deÅ¿igns to give it.</p>
                        <p>But before we enter into the explication of that Idea, or Notion of Beauty in <hi>Trees,</hi> it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to remember, That, as I have Å¿aid in my TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Plantations,</hi> we have but few of thoÅ¿e that are call'd <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> that Naturally remain <hi>Low, DwarfiÅ¿h,</hi> and, as I may Å¿ay, <hi>Creeping</hi> enough, either to make regular <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or yet leÅ¿s, to make <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> All <hi>Trees,</hi> following the Inclination which Nature has given them, endeavour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48210:131"/>
to riÅ¿e, and conÅ¿equently 'tis only the InduÅ¿try of the <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who oppoÅ¿ing the CourÅ¿e of Nature, hinders them from forming long <hi>Stems,</hi> and from growing Tall.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e <hi>Gard'ners</hi> knowing that, as we have already Å¿aid, the <hi>Sap</hi> which is to form thoÅ¿e <hi>Stems,</hi> lies partly in the <hi>Trees;</hi> much in the Å¿ame manner, as the water which is to form the Spouts of Water-Works, lies in the Pipes: They have concluded from thence, that if they Å¿topp'd the PaÅ¿Å¿age which carries this <hi>Sap</hi> upwards, which is eaÅ¿ie to do, by Å¿hort'ning the <hi>Stems</hi> of the <hi>Trees,</hi> there wou'd be no further likelyhood of its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a <hi>Standard;</hi> and Å¿o that <hi>Sap</hi> which is in motion, or Å¿trives to get out, without any poÅ¿Å¿ibility of being prevented, finding no longer a paÅ¿Å¿age to riÅ¿e up, as it ought, will diÅ¿charge it Å¿elf at the place where its CourÅ¿e has been interrupted, and will produce the Å¿ame effect there, it would have done higher, had it had the liberty of aÅ¿cending further; Å¿o that this <hi>Sap</hi> Å¿pringing out of the Å¿ides, not only by many Overtures, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready actually form'd there, but likewiÅ¿e by or through others, that it will make it Å¿elf, proportionably as it is abundant, it will produce to the right and left a pretty conÅ¿iderable quantity of fine <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I muÅ¿t now tell you, that if the <hi>Tree</hi> that is Å¿horten'd be Planted in the open Air, it may be diÅ¿pos'd to make a fine <hi>Dwarf;</hi> and if near any Wall, to make a fine <hi>Wall-Tree.</hi> I have alÅ¿o explain'd in the Å¿ame <hi>TreatiÅ¿e of Plantations</hi> what is a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> and what a <hi>Wall-Tree.</hi> I have there Å¿hewn what was the Intention of thoÅ¿e that firÅ¿t made them, and of what uÅ¿e they may be to us. I have likewiÅ¿e declar'd in it, that when the Walls are high, you muÅ¿t Plant Long Body'd <hi>Trees</hi> to garniÅ¿h the top of the Wall; and that inÅ¿tead of leaving them there the liberty of forming a round <hi>Tree,</hi> as they wou'd do were they left at liberty, their <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be conÅ¿train'd, like thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Trees</hi> that are Å¿horten'd, as we will demonÅ¿trate; after having firÅ¿t explain'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Beauty both of the one and the others does conÅ¿iÅ¿t; I mean, of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Beauty of <hi>Dwarfs</hi> requires two Conditions, the one in reÅ¿pect to the <hi>Stem,</hi> and the other of the Head: According to the firÅ¿t Condition, <hi>Dwarfs</hi> muÅ¿t be low <hi>Stem;</hi> and according to the Å¿econd, they muÅ¿t have an open Head, that is, free from thick <hi>Branches</hi> in the middle; it muÅ¿t be round in its Circumference, and equally furniÅ¿h'd with good <hi>Branches</hi> on the Å¿ides.</p>
                        <p>I will explain more particularly hereafter what I mean by that Opening of the <hi>Middle,</hi> and it Å¿hall be in the place where I Å¿hall give Directions how to attain to it; but in the mean time a Man muÅ¿t have a right apprehenÅ¿ion of the four Conditions of that Figure, and be fully perÅ¿waded of it, in order to underÅ¿tand uÅ¿efully my Maxims of <hi>Pruning,</hi> and grow Skilful in them, in caÅ¿e he approves them Å¿o well, as to be willing to PractiÅ¿e them.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay nothing as yet of the heighth of the Head of thoÅ¿e <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> it depends on the Age of the Trees, being low in thoÅ¿e that are yet young, and riÅ¿ing in all according as they grow: But as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, I wou'd not willingly have it exceed Six or Seven Foot: It being better, in my Opinion, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿hou'd grow in extent of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and Breadth, than to let them riÅ¿e high. The PleaÅ¿ure of Sight, which dreads whatever Limits it too much, particularly in <hi>Gardens,</hi> beÅ¿ides the PerÅ¿ecution of the Winds, which eaÅ¿ily beats down the <hi>Fruit</hi> of High <hi>Trees,</hi> makes me fix to that meaÅ¿ure. As the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Dwarfs</hi> is incomparably more difficult, and conÅ¿equently contains a great many more Rules than the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi> I will begin with that, before I Å¿peak of the other.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Idea of Beauty which <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> require; together with the Maxims of PalliÅ¿ading.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TO advance our <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> to that perfection of Beauty which beÅ¿t becomes them; I am of Opinion, that it muÅ¿t be our particular care, that all the <hi>Branches</hi> of each <hi>Tree,</hi> in Å¿preading over the Å¿ides of that part of the Wall which they are to garniÅ¿h; muÅ¿t be Å¿o well Å¿tretch'd, and Å¿o equally plac'd, both on the right and leÅ¿t; that in their whole extent, taking them from the place, whence they Å¿everally proceed, as far as all the extremities of their heighth and roundneÅ¿s, no part of the <hi>Tree</hi> may appear thinner or fuller than another; in Å¿o much, that at firÅ¿t Å¿ight, one may diÅ¿tinctly Å¿ee all the Branches that compoÅ¿e it, Å¿o far as to be able, to tell them with eaÅ¿e, if Å¿o mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ThinneÅ¿s is the greateÅ¿t imperfection of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> as fulneÅ¿s is the greateÅ¿t fault of <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> when I Å¿ay, that I would have my <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> full, I do not mean, that they Å¿hould be full of ill <hi>Branches,</hi> old, worn, or uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, as a great many ignorant PerÅ¿ons affect to have them; neither on the other hand, in deÅ¿iring my <hi>Dwarfs</hi> to be open in the middle, would I have them empty, like the inÅ¿ide of a GlaÅ¿s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do particularly deÅ¿ire all <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> to be very mindful of theÅ¿e two Ideas of Beauty.</p>
                        <p>As to the Beauty of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> it is certainly diÅ¿agreeable, to Å¿ee their <hi>Branches</hi> croÅ¿Å¿ing one another, which muÅ¿t be avoided as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible; but whereas thinneÅ¿s, as I have already Å¿aid, is in my Opinion, the defect the moÅ¿t contrary to the Beauty of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> I am for endeavouring to avoid it above all things; Å¿o that for that ReaÅ¿on, I will have it allow'd, nay and order'd too, to run them over one another in Å¿ome occaÅ¿ions, and that particularly it may be allow'd for the great Branches, which are alone the foundation of all the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> to be Å¿ometimes drawn over Å¿mall ones, or the Å¿mall ones over them, otherwiÅ¿e it would be impoÅ¿Å¿ible to avoid the danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the diÅ¿agreeable inconvenience of that unlucky BarrenneÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e little <hi>Branches,</hi> which we may in Å¿ome manner look upon here, as Temporary <hi>Branches;</hi> are commonly, as we have Å¿aid, the only ones that muÅ¿t yield <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that is the ReaÅ¿on, why they have been carefully and preciouÅ¿ly preÅ¿erv'd; but whereas, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having given that <hi>Fruit,</hi> they muÅ¿t infallibly periÅ¿h; they will be Å¿oon retrench'd from our <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and conÅ¿equently they will Å¿oon Å¿upercede the reproach of croÅ¿Å¿ing, they may have drawn upon the <hi>Gard'ner;</hi> and he Å¿hall thereby be freed from another reproach, which is much more to be fear'd, and that is the want of <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So then, that croÅ¿Å¿ing muÅ¿t not be us'd, unleÅ¿s there be an abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿ity; inÅ¿omuch that when it can be avoided, I condemn the <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who, either through Ignorance, or Negligence, have thereby deÅ¿troy'd the agreeable Simetry their <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> might have had.</p>
                        <p>And becauÅ¿e, that, in the firÅ¿t place, the only way of giving every one of thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> the Beauty, which I have been Å¿peaking of, is by means of <hi>Pruning;</hi> and that in the Å¿econd place, every <hi>Tree</hi> being compos'd of two Parts; of which the one is call'd the <hi>Stock</hi> or <hi>Stem,</hi> and the other the <hi>Branches;</hi> it is certainly upon thoÅ¿e two parts, that the <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be perform'd, but yet much more upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> than upon the <hi>Stem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauÅ¿e, that chiefly in <hi>Trees,</hi> there are, as we have Å¿aid, Å¿everal kind of <hi>Branches,</hi> very different the one from the other, all having their particular ReaÅ¿ons, either to be taken away, or preÅ¿erv'd; and among thoÅ¿e that are to be preÅ¿erv'd, Å¿ome are to be Å¿horten'd, becauÅ¿e they are too long, and others to remain whole; Å¿o conÅ¿equently, there muÅ¿t be a great deal of care taken, for the well mannaging of them both.</p>
                        <p>I do think my Å¿elf indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably oblig'd, to endeavour to unravel, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, all the diÅ¿tinctions that are to be made among thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches;</hi> or otherwiÅ¿e it will not be poÅ¿Å¿ible to underÅ¿tand the Maxims I deÅ¿ign to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h for <hi>Pruning</hi> well.</p>
                        <p>I am of Opinion, that I muÅ¿t take the Å¿ame Method in this, as People do in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Read: The FirÅ¿t thing, is to learn the Letters of the Alphabet: The Second, how to uÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Letters, to joyn two or three together, to form Å¿illables; And, in fine, the Third, to Learn the Union of many Sillables, in order to make whole Words; and theÅ¿e Words following each other afterwards, compoÅ¿e both the Line and Page, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Å¿ame manner, will I firÅ¿t Teach, how to underÅ¿tand well the <hi>Branches</hi> of our <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> giving them Names that may expreÅ¿s what they are, and then the UÅ¿e and peculiar Function of each of them; to the end, that Å¿everal of them, being well plac'd,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48210:132"/>
may render the <hi>Trees</hi> Beautiful, and diÅ¿poÅ¿e them Å¿oon to yield abundance of good <hi>Fruit.</hi> Perhaps on the occaÅ¿ion of this CompariÅ¿on, it would not be improper to Å¿ay; that as in Reading, Words are only form'd by the Reciprocal Function of the Vowels and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onants; Å¿o our <hi>Trees</hi> only become Beautiful, when they have at one and the Å¿ame time, a reaÅ¿onable proportion of <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Fruit-Branches;</hi> Å¿o that as the Vowels, or ConÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants aÅ¿under, can form no Words, or DiÅ¿courÅ¿e; neither can <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> aÅ¿under, compoÅ¿e a Beautiful <hi>Fruit-Tree.</hi>

                           <p>Of Branches in General.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>RIghtly to underÅ¿tand the Doctrine of <hi>Branches;</hi> Five material Things muÅ¿t be obÅ¿erv'd.</p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, That as they compoÅ¿e a conÅ¿iderable part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> they Å¿prout out of two parts of it; Å¿ome Å¿hoot directly out of the main body, and thoÅ¿e are the firÅ¿t, and may be Å¿til'd, the Elder, or Mothers; their number is not conÅ¿iderable; the others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are produc'd by theÅ¿e, and are as it were the Daughters of theÅ¿e Mother-<hi>Branches:</hi> The number of theÅ¿e laÅ¿t is infinite; for Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively in their turns, they become every one Mother-<hi>Branches,</hi> to many others.</p>
                        <p>It muÅ¿t be noted, in the Å¿econd place, that from the Body of every <hi>Branch,</hi> when the <hi>Tree</hi> is in a good CaÅ¿e, there yearly grow new ones at the extremities of it; and that more or leÅ¿s, according to the Å¿trength or weakneÅ¿s of that <hi>Branch,</hi> which I Å¿hall call Mother-<hi>Branch,</hi> in relation to the new ones it produceth.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, you muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve that theÅ¿e new <hi>Branches</hi> grow in two different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the one in a Regular Order, which is the beÅ¿t, the moÅ¿t common, and moÅ¿t frequent; the others in an Irregular Order, which is the leaÅ¿t common, and leaÅ¿t fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                        <p>That Order, which is moÅ¿t common, and the beÅ¿t of the Production of the new <hi>Branches,</hi> when they produce more than one, is, that tho' both the one and the other at the Å¿ame time iÅ¿Å¿ue from the extremities of one that is more Ancient, whether <hi>Prun'd,</hi> or not, they are notwithÅ¿tanding regularly all of a different thickneÅ¿s, and length; for every one of the higheÅ¿t, are always both thicker and longer than any of thoÅ¿e that are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under them, drawing nearer to the <hi>Body:</hi> I Å¿aid, when it produces more than one; for when the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> brings forth but one, the Daughter at the end of the Summer proves as large as the Mother, and is very good; when that Mother yields two, that which is grown from the extremity, which I call the firÅ¿t, or higheÅ¿t, is thicker and longer than that which is grown immediately beneath it, which I name the Å¿econd, or loweÅ¿t: And in the Å¿ame manner, when the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> produces three, four, five, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the firÅ¿t, that is the higheÅ¿t, is thicker and longer than the Å¿econd, Å¿o the Å¿econd in the Å¿ame manner exceeds the third, the third the fourth; and Å¿o by degrees, what ever quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of new <hi>Branches</hi> the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> may produce, as it appears by the Figures.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, it is eaÅ¿ie to judge, that the Order which is leaÅ¿t Common, and worÅ¿t in the Production of new <hi>Branches,</hi> is, when the Common Order is inverted, Å¿o that there are weak ones in the place where there ought to be thick ones; and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there are large ones, where they ought to be weak, and where perhaps there ought to be none; as it appears by the Figure of <hi>Branches</hi> mark'd with a *.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough to know whence the <hi>Branches</hi> proceed, nor the Order in which they come forth; it is requiÅ¿ite to know, in the fourth place, that as that greater or Å¿maller number of <hi>Branches,</hi> depends upon the force or weakneÅ¿s of the Mother-<hi>Branch;</hi> I think, that to make my Å¿elf the better underÅ¿tood, it will be Å¿it to call thoÅ¿e Å¿trong, which are thick; and to call thoÅ¿e weak, which are Å¿mall; every one of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> having their Functions Regulated according to their Degrees of Force, or WeakneÅ¿s; Å¿o that they Å¿eldom incroach upon one another, being wholly apply'd to the diÅ¿charge of the firÅ¿t Duty which Nature Å¿eems to have impos'd upon them, in forming them.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, you muÅ¿t note, and this is the moÅ¿t Material Point; that among all the <hi>Branches,</hi> whether Å¿trong or weak; there are Å¿ome which have the real Character of good, of which a great many muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd: There are likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome which have the real Character of bad ones; for which reaÅ¿on, a Name of Reprobation is given them: In regularity, almoÅ¿t all theÅ¿e laÅ¿t ought to be expell'd; let us obÅ¿erve how to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the one certainly from the other.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>To know the difference of Good and Ill <hi>Branches.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE have two Certain and Infallible marks in relation to <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> certainly to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the good and ill <hi>Branches</hi> from each other, either while they are Å¿till upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or when they are cut off: The one depends upon the difference of their Scituation, and Original, and the other from the difference of their <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e that every body knows that there are <hi>Eyes</hi> upon every <hi>Branch,</hi> which are little knotty places, a little elevated above the reÅ¿t of the Bark; it is upon thoÅ¿e little pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that the Leaves are actually fix'd, as they are Å¿een there in the Summer time; or at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome have been fix'd there Å¿ome time before, which may either have dropt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, or perhaps have been taken off.</p>
                        <p>What we learn by that difference of Scituation, and Original, is firÅ¿t, that the <hi>Branches</hi> to be good, muÅ¿t abÅ¿olutely, and only proceed from the extremities of thoÅ¿e which were remaining upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> at the entrance of the Spring, whether they were form'd in the laÅ¿t year, or Å¿ome years before; or likewiÅ¿e whether the one and the others have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> as is CuÅ¿tomary, or not; as it happens Å¿ometimes, for Example, in <hi>Standard-Trees.</hi> In fine, as we only Å¿peak here in relation to Trees that are liable to <hi>Pruning,</hi> it muÅ¿t be granted, that it is only from the extremity of <hi>Branches,</hi> tho' never Å¿o Old, which have been <hi>Prun'd,</hi> at the SeaÅ¿on of the laÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> that the New <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t proceed: In the Å¿econd place, what we gather from the difference of Scituation, and Original of new <hi>Branches,</hi> is, That thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> to be good, muÅ¿t have been produc'd in the moÅ¿t ordinary and moÅ¿t common Order of Nature, as we have heretofore explain'd it.</p>
                        <p>From thence two things muÅ¿t be concluded: The firÅ¿t, that any <hi>Branch</hi> which, inÅ¿tead of being grown from the extremity of that which had been form'd the preceeding Summer, or at leaÅ¿t from the extremity of that which had been taken Å¿horter at the laÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> proceeds from any other part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> be it either from the <hi>Stem,</hi> or Å¿ome other Old <hi>Branch,</hi> that had not been <hi>Prun'd:</hi> I Å¿ay it muÅ¿t be concluded, that Å¿uch a <hi>Branch,</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Å¿ize, thick or Å¿mall, is an ill <hi>Branch,</hi> as I will demonÅ¿trate hereafter.</p>
                        <p>And what muÅ¿t be concluded in the Å¿econd place, is, That any <hi>Branch</hi> which, inÅ¿tead of being grown in the good order of Nature, being either thicker or longer than that which is immediately beneath it, drawing towards the Superiour Extremity; it muÅ¿t, I Å¿ay, be concluded that Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> is likewiÅ¿e nought: It is for thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Branches</hi> that the name of <hi>falÅ¿e wood</hi> has been made, to expreÅ¿s that thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> are incapable of performing what we deÅ¿ire; they muÅ¿t be us'd altogether in a different manner from the good ones. We will Å¿et down particular Maxims to that effect.</p>
                        <p>But whereas I do not think it Å¿ufficient to have methinks, pretty intelligibly explain'd the difference of <hi>Branches,</hi> by that which is grounded upon the difference of their Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Original; I will moreover explain the other, which is founded upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their <hi>Eyes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Mark of the good ones by that difference of <hi>Eyes,</hi> requires that in the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> Å¿hould be thick, and well fed, and very cloÅ¿e one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas the mark of the bad ones by thoÅ¿e Å¿ame <hi>Eyes,</hi> is that in all the lower part of Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> thoÅ¿e <hi>Eyes</hi> are flat, ill fed, and hardly form'd, and very diÅ¿tant the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e two different Marks, as well by Situations, as by <hi>Eyes,</hi> are eaÅ¿ily known in the Figures annex'd hereunto <hi>A. B.</hi> in which the ill ones are mark'd with a *.</p>
                        <p>You may Å¿ee both very good, and very bad ones, as well among the thick and Å¿trong ones, as among thoÅ¿e that are Å¿mall and feeble. As to theÅ¿e, their weakneÅ¿s, is Å¿ometimes Å¿o exceÅ¿Å¿ive, that like Å¿apleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> incapable of bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t of nouriÅ¿hing and Å¿uÅ¿taining the weight of their <hi>Fruit,</hi> they muÅ¿t be wholly taken off from our <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially from the <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> of which the <hi>Branches</hi> are not tack'd; becauÅ¿e that to do well, we muÅ¿t Å¿uffer nothing that is not good.</p>
                        <p>The good weak <hi>Branches,</hi> I mean thoÅ¿e which being well plac'd, and of a mean thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and length, are as it were proper and certain InÅ¿truments to produce Speedy, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Good <hi>Fruit,</hi> and are infallibly Å¿o, provided the FroÅ¿t Å¿poils nothing, either while they are in <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> or Å¿oon after the <hi>Fruit</hi> is knit; for Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿eldom fail of producing <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om-</hi>Buds; and beÅ¿ides, cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly Å¿erve to any end but yielding of <hi>Fruit,</hi> unleÅ¿s contrary to the Natural and Common Order of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> they Å¿hou'd happen to have certain overflowings of <hi>Sap</hi> to thicken them in an extraordinary manner,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48210:135"/>
and Å¿o alter their Property; that is, convert them into <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens Å¿ometimes in all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> particulaely in Å¿uch as have been ill <hi>Prun'd:</hi> I will explain in the Sequel, what Method is fit to be us'd in Å¿uch OccaÅ¿ions.</p>
                        <p>The good Å¿trong <hi>Branches,</hi> of which the Principal UÅ¿e is firÅ¿t to begin, and then continue to give the <hi>Trees</hi> a proper Figure, which they can receive by no other means, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly employ'd in producing yearly on their Extremities other good new <hi>Branches,</hi> Å¿ome Å¿trong, and others weak, as it appears by the Figure <hi>A.</hi> And the great Skill of the <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in making a good uÅ¿e of both.</p>
                        <p>And to that end, as it is material to preÅ¿erve the good weak ones for <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is the peculiar End of <hi>Fruit-Gardens,</hi> it is likewiÅ¿e very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to work prudently to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage our Operations upon the good Å¿trong ones: It is true, that it is requiÅ¿ite to preÅ¿erve on the Extremities of every Old <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e new Å¿trong ones that are grown there, but that commonly extends but to a Å¿mall Number; for Example, to one only; and Å¿ometimes the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> being extraordinarily Vigorous, it may extend to two, or three; as I will demonÅ¿trate hereafter, in explaining the manner of <hi>Pruning,</hi> for which we muÅ¿t have very good ReaÅ¿ons; for if too many were preÅ¿erv'd, we Å¿hou'd certainly fall into the inconvenience of ConfuÅ¿ion, which inconvenience Å¿poils the whole diÅ¿poÅ¿ition towards <hi>Fruit,</hi> as well as the beauty of the Figure.</p>
                        <p>There is chiefly a great deal of Skill requir'd, to know how to take away entirely all the uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> whether it be becauÅ¿e they are worn or Å¿pent, or becauÅ¿e they have no good qualifications; and the Å¿ame concerning thoÅ¿e that are to be preÅ¿erv'd, to know how to regulate their length proportionably to their Force, and the Vigour of the whole <hi>Tree;</hi> Å¿o that afterwards every one of them may be able to produce on its Extremity juÅ¿t as many good <hi>Branches</hi> as are neceÅ¿Å¿ary either for the <hi>Fruit,</hi> or for the perfecting the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> or for preÅ¿erving it when it is eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd: And this is what we call the Common <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WHereas in this TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Pruning,</hi> I am of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity oblig'd, to make uÅ¿e fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the Words of <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> of <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>WeakneÅ¿s;</hi> which Words bear a double meaning, and therefore might puzzle the Reader; I think it will be proper, before I enter into the particulars of that matter, to give a Å¿hort Account of the Sence, in which I take and uÅ¿e them; I muÅ¿t omit nothing of what may help me to avoid the ambiguity which thoÅ¿e Terms might create in my Maxims. LeÅ¿t that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well underÅ¿tood, being Paradoxes, they might not at firÅ¿t meet with all the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could wiÅ¿h them, and hope to procure them in the Å¿equel.</p>
                        <p>When ever then I Å¿peak here, of Å¿trong <hi>Branches,</hi> and Å¿trong <hi>Roots;</hi> I mean, as I have already hinted, Å¿uch as are thick; and likewiÅ¿e, Å¿peaking of weak <hi>Branches,</hi> I mean Å¿uch as are Å¿mall: Moreover, when I Å¿peak of a Å¿trong <hi>Tree,</hi> I mean a vigorous <hi>Tree;</hi> that is, a <hi>Tree</hi> that produces a great many fine thick <hi>Branches;</hi> and in Å¿peaking of a weak <hi>Tree,</hi> I mean a languiÅ¿hing <hi>Tree;</hi> that is, a <hi>Tree</hi> that yields but very few <hi>Å¿hoots,</hi> and for the moÅ¿t part all Å¿mall.</p>
                        <p>This being agreed on, and conformably to the Sence, in which the words of <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> of <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>WeakneÅ¿s,</hi> are commonly taken, when us'd in Å¿peaking Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Animals, and Å¿ometimes of Timber to Build with, in relation to the burthens they are able to bear.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay, in Å¿peaking of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Branches,</hi> that thoÅ¿e that are Å¿trong muÅ¿t be kept Å¿hort, I mean thoÅ¿e that are thick; and that the weak ones muÅ¿t be kept long, that is, thoÅ¿e that are Å¿mall; and in Å¿peaking of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Roots,</hi> I preÅ¿cribe a clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Method from the <hi>Branches;</hi> for we muÅ¿t keep them Å¿hort, that are weak and Å¿mall, and thoÅ¿e that are thick, Å¿trong, and better nouriÅ¿h'd, a little longer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>; as I explain in the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> in that part where I give directions for preparing <hi>Trees</hi> to <hi>Plant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I likewiÅ¿e call <hi>Apple-Trees, graffed</hi> upon <hi>Paradice-Stocks,</hi> weak <hi>Trees;</hi> as alÅ¿o early <hi>Cherry-Trees, graffed</hi> upon common <hi>Cherry-Stocks;</hi> as I Å¿ay, that thoÅ¿e that are <hi>graffed</hi> upon free Stocks, that is, upon good Wildlings, are Å¿trong and vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> theÅ¿e

being really capable' of producing and bearing a great deal, and the others but very little.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e in that SenÅ¿e, that after having regulated of what thickneÅ¿s partly the <hi>Trees</hi> of each kind ought to be, to be proper to be choÅ¿en and Planted by a skilful <hi>Gard'ner;</hi> I Å¿ay in that CaÅ¿e, obÅ¿erving the difference between the one and the other; that for Example, Å¿uch a <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> or Å¿uch a <hi>Peach-Tree,</hi> in which I find a fitting thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, is Å¿trong enough, and Å¿o will be fit to be Planted: I Å¿ay likewiÅ¿e that another <hi>Tree</hi> of that Kind, being of an exceÅ¿Å¿ive thickneÅ¿s, is too Å¿trong; and that on the contrary, another of that Kind, in which that neceÅ¿Å¿ary thickneÅ¿s is wanting, is too weak: It is likewiÅ¿e in that SenÅ¿e, that it may truly be Å¿aid, that the <hi>Trees</hi> which grow Å¿lowly, and never grow extream Tall, are the WeakeÅ¿t; witneÅ¿s the <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> the <hi>Medlar,</hi> the <note place="margin">AÅ¿pices cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatos Pomorum pondere ramos. Ut Å¿ua quod peperit, vix fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Arboronus.</note> 
                           <hi>Hazzle,</hi> or <hi>Nut-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Paradice Apple-Tree, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I maintain two things more in the Å¿ame SenÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t is, That care muÅ¿t be taken that the weak <hi>Branch</hi> which is full of <hi>Buds,</hi> be however Å¿trong enough to bear the weight of its <hi>Fruit,</hi> becauÅ¿e that otherwiÅ¿e, if it be too weak, it will break under it; and therefore I maintain that no more muÅ¿t be left upon each, than in proportion to the Å¿trength it may have to bear it.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd thing I maintain, relates particularly to the <hi>Graffs</hi> that are made Cleft-wiÅ¿e, upon which, when a <hi>Branch,</hi> being Å¿mall at the time of its <hi>Graffing,</hi> becomes afterwards much thicker than before, methinks that it is hard forbearing to Å¿ay that it is grown the Å¿tronger by it, there being no likelyhood of maintaining, on the contrary, that the thicker it is, the weaker it is.</p>
                        <p>From all I have been Å¿aying, to explain the Å¿ignification of thoÅ¿e words <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Strength, Weak</hi> and <hi>WeakneÅ¿s,</hi> it follows, that they may, according to my Å¿ence, be uÅ¿efully employ'd, and diÅ¿tinctly underÅ¿tood in the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, among theÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> there are Å¿ome which yearly produce a great quantity of thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and few Å¿mall ones: There are Å¿ome that produce a reaÅ¿onable number of both; and in fine, there are Å¿ome which grow but little either from Foot, or Head; That is, that produce but few new <hi>Roots</hi> under <hi>Ground,</hi> and even thoÅ¿e all Å¿mall ones, and but few new <hi>Branches</hi> above ground, and thoÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e almoÅ¿t all Å¿hort and Å¿mall; which are conÅ¿equently far from appearing, as they Å¿ay commonly, Fine, Strong, and Vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> but, on the contrary, look, if I may expreÅ¿s my Å¿elf Å¿o, Sick, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hing.</p>
                        <p>This Production of different <hi>Branches,</hi> is only the Work of Nature, which is perform'd innocently, and without the leaÅ¿t dependance on the ReaÅ¿onings of PhiloÅ¿ophy; and tho' this Production has not been the work of the Meditation of Man, yet it has furniÅ¿h'd him a fair Subject to work upon; Å¿o that we pretend to have drawn great InÅ¿tructions from it, towards the Cultivating and Management of our <hi>Fruit-Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Being then certain, that all the Parts, of which all manner of <hi>Trees</hi> are Compos'd, do not receive an equal quantity of <hi>Sap,</hi> Å¿ince all the <hi>Branches</hi> are not of an equal thickneÅ¿s, and length; I mean, Å¿ome being conÅ¿iderably thicker, and harder to break, which conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be Å¿aid to be Å¿tronger than others their Neighbours: Being likewiÅ¿e certain, that upon the Å¿ame <hi>Trees,</hi> there are certain <hi>Branches,</hi> which are conÅ¿iderably Å¿maller, and more eaÅ¿ie to break, and therefore may be Å¿aid to be weaker than other Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones.</p>
                        <p>It is moreover certain, as I have heretofore offer'd, and 'tis what I have obÅ¿erv'd (which perhaps few had done before me) I Å¿ay it is certain, that very Å¿eldom <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> form themÅ¿elves upon thick and Å¿trong <hi>Branches;</hi> Å¿o that, for InÅ¿tance, if a <hi>Pear-Tree</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce none but Å¿uch, it will commonly bear no <hi>Pears;</hi> whereas, on the contrary, the Å¿mall and weak <hi>Branches</hi> produce generally a great deal of <hi>Fruit;</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that if Å¿ometimes in one and the Å¿ame <hi>Tree</hi> all one Å¿ide appears as it were Pining, in not having produc'd any new <hi>Branches,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t but very weak ones: It is obÅ¿ervable, that that Å¿ide grows ordinarily full of <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> while the other part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which by the abundance of Fine <hi>Branches</hi> appears very Healthy and Vigorous, produces but very few, and often none at all.</p>
                        <p>This ObÅ¿ervation has put me upon performing two Operations which I have found very Å¿ucceÅ¿sful. The firÅ¿t is, that when a <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> remains Å¿everal years without produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing hardly any thing beÅ¿ides theÅ¿e kind of <hi>Branches</hi> of an extraordinary thickneÅ¿s and length; and conÅ¿equently bears but little <hi>Fruit:</hi> In that caÅ¿e I have found no better and readier way to make it Fruitful, than by the extraordinary <hi>Pruning</hi> I have mention'd heretofore; that is, by applying my Å¿elf at the beginning of the Spring to the <hi>Source</hi> or <hi>Spring</hi> of that Force and Vigour, which are the <hi>Roots,</hi> in order to diminiÅ¿h their Action; and to that end I lay open half the Foot of that <hi>Tree,</hi> and wholly take away one or two,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48210:136"/>
and Å¿ometimes more of the thickeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t active <hi>Roots</hi> I meet with, and retrench them Å¿o well from the Place where they grow, that there does not remain the leaÅ¿t part capable of performing the leaÅ¿t Function of a <hi>Root;</hi> by that means I prevent the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance of the <hi>Sap</hi> for the future, and conÅ¿equently render the whole Head leÅ¿s Vigorous; whence it follows, that it <hi>Shoots</hi> leÅ¿s of theÅ¿e thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and more Å¿mall ones, and thus it is diÅ¿pos'd to bear <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd Operation is that, when in the Month of <hi>May</hi> a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hoots out of an extraordinary thickneÅ¿s, either in the ordinary CourÅ¿e of an old Planted <hi>Tree,</hi> or in the firÅ¿t Years of <hi>Graffing,</hi> and that conÅ¿equently it will be evident that Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> will be at the Å¿ame time very long, and have no DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition to bear <hi>Fruit;</hi> this being grounded upon the ReaÅ¿on of its <hi>Strength,</hi> or ThickneÅ¿s, which proceeds from too great an abundance of <hi>Sap;</hi> in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, I am of Opinion, that it is eaÅ¿ie for thoÅ¿e that are willing Å¿o to do; to divide, as I may call it, that Torrent of <hi>Sap;</hi> and whereas inÅ¿tead that its whole Tendency was only to the Production of a thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which for the moÅ¿t part would he of no UÅ¿e at all, it is eaÅ¿ie to reduce it, and as it were oblige it to make Å¿everal very good ones, whereof one part will be weak for <hi>Fruit,</hi> and others Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently thick for <hi>Wood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that is fit to be done in the Month of <hi>May:</hi> Therefore at that time I cauÅ¿e that young thick <hi>Shoot</hi> to be <hi>Pinch'd,</hi> that is broken with the Nail, and leave it no greater length than that of two, three, or four <hi>Eyes</hi> at moÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>Hereafter I will explain the manner, and Å¿ucceÅ¿s of Å¿uch an Operation, after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd what relates to <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before I enter into the particulars of <hi>Pruning;</hi> I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that we are to <hi>Prune</hi> either young <hi>Trees,</hi> which have never yet felt the <hi>Pruning</hi> Knife; and, for Example, have not been Planted above a Year or two; or Old <hi>Trees,</hi> which have already been <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿everal Years before.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e beÅ¿ides, that theÅ¿e old <hi>Trees</hi> are in a good condition, as having been govern'd by PerÅ¿ons of UnderÅ¿tanding, Å¿o that they only want being preÅ¿erv'd; or elÅ¿e that they are in an ill caÅ¿e, either for having always been neglected; that is, not <hi>Prun'd;</hi> or elÅ¿e, for having been ill <hi>Prun'd;</hi> Å¿o that it may be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to endeavour the correcting of their defects.</p>
                        <p>I do not really believe, that I may Å¿o foreÅ¿ee all the CaÅ¿es of <hi>Pruning,</hi> as without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting one, be able to give Rules for every one that may happen; I am far from being Å¿o preÅ¿umptuous, knowing, that it is almoÅ¿t, in this caÅ¿e, as it is in PhyÅ¿ick, and in the matter of Law-Suits: <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Gallen,</hi> with Å¿o many <hi>AphoriÅ¿ms</hi> for the one; <hi>Le Code</hi> and <hi>Le DigeÅ¿te,</hi> with Å¿o many Regulations and Ord'nances for the other, have not been capable of foreÅ¿eeing and providing againÅ¿t all, nor conÅ¿equently to decide all, Å¿ince there daily occur new CaÅ¿es: All I pretend, is to give you exact Information of the Method I have practis'd for theÅ¿e Thirty Years with an extraordinary application, in which I have been very Å¿ucceÅ¿sful; as well as thoÅ¿e who underÅ¿tand it, and who, in imitation of me, do me the Honour to PractiÅ¿e my Maxims.</p>
                        <p>To explain the particulars of this Method, I will divide what I have to Å¿ay into three <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿is;</hi> and FirÅ¿t, in favour of the Curious, who begin to make New <hi>Plantations,</hi> I will Å¿peak of <hi>Trees</hi> newly Planted, upon which I will firÅ¿t give General Rules for the well <hi>Pruning</hi> of all the <hi>Shoots,</hi> which every <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hall have produc'd; beginning with thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t Year, and Å¿hall continue in the Å¿ame manner from Year to Year, for five Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive Years, in order to Å¿hew the effect of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of every one of theÅ¿e five Years; afterwards I will give other Rules to remedy certain defects, which will happen Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, notwithÅ¿tanding the firÅ¿t cares of a Skilful <hi>Gard'ner:</hi> With all theÅ¿e precautions, and this Method, I have ground to believe, that a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who will be tollerably induÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may be Å¿ufficiently inÅ¿tructed in this matter to underÅ¿tand it, to take pleaÅ¿ure in it, and laÅ¿tly, to perfect himÅ¿elf in it, by his own practice, as much as he Å¿hall have occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for.</p>
                        <p>After having thus labour'd in favour of the Curious, who have made new <hi>Plantations,</hi> and will mannage them themÅ¿elves; I will proceed to the other Curious, who all on a Å¿udden find themÅ¿elves MaÅ¿ters of certain <hi>Gardens,</hi> wherein the <hi>Trees</hi> are old; whether thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> have been for a long time well mannag'd, or ill, either through Ignorance or want of Skill; and I will endeavour to make them apprehend what I would do to them, were I to have the mannagement of them; This will be particularly of uÅ¿e to all kind of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who in all SeaÅ¿ons, caÅ¿ting their Eyes upon any <hi>Trees</hi> whatever, Å¿hall not only be deÅ¿irous to judge of their good or ill Condition to Å¿atisfie others; but likewiÅ¿e, Å¿hall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themÅ¿elves in <hi>Pruning</hi> of them; or at leaÅ¿t, to preÅ¿cribe what Å¿hould be done to them

                        <p>I Å¿ay then, with every body, that the Saw Å¿erves here, to take off dry and old <hi>Wood,</hi> which is conÅ¿equently very hard, and capable of Å¿poiling the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> or elÅ¿e to take away that which is ill-plac'd, or Å¿o thick, that it cannot eaÅ¿ily, and at once be cut off with the <hi>Pruning-Knife.</hi> I Å¿ay next, that this being granted, the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity Å¿erve to cut off, at one cut, young, lively, tender, and well-plac'd <hi>Wood,</hi> of a moderate thickneÅ¿s; Å¿o that the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> muÅ¿t never be us'd upon any thing that would preÅ¿ently blunt its edge, and for which the Saw is more proper than it; nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e employ the Saw to retrench any <hi>Branches,</hi> which one good cut of the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> may cleverly perform.</p>
                        <p>But it is not Å¿ufficient to be agreed upon the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity and UÅ¿e of theÅ¿e two Tools, for the different OccaÅ¿ions in which they are employ'd; perhaps it will not be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides that, to make the deÅ¿cription both of the one and the other. I begin by the Figure of the <hi>Pruning-Knives</hi> which I uÅ¿e, and which I look upon as the moÅ¿t convenient; for they are made Å¿everal ways which I do not approve of, Å¿ome being too hooked, in reÅ¿pect to their length, and others not enough; Å¿o that in my Opinion, neither the one nor the other are near Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to work with, as thoÅ¿e which keep a medium between theÅ¿e two Figures; I have often try'd them of all kinds, and have at laÅ¿t fix'd upon theÅ¿e that are figur'd here, which perhaps are of my own Invention; at leaÅ¿t I have taken a great deal of pains to bring the Workmen to make them exactly according to the Model which I had given them, they Å¿till made them too crooked or too Å¿treight, and conÅ¿equently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient; Å¿o that in this CaÅ¿e, the Figure of the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> is conÅ¿iderable.</p>
                        <p>However, it is not enough to have the <hi>Pruning-Knives</hi> well Å¿hap'd; beÅ¿ides that, their matter muÅ¿t be of good temper'd Steel, Å¿o that the edge may neither turn, or notch eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they muÅ¿t be well whetted, often clean'd from the filth that faÅ¿tens upon them in working, and Å¿et as often as the edge is obÅ¿erv'd not to run Å¿moothly in cutting eaÅ¿ily, in proportion to the Å¿trength apply'd to them; and beÅ¿ides, when there are many <hi>Trees</hi> to cut, 'tis fit to have many <hi>Pruning-Knives,</hi> to change them often; for without doubt, with good Tools, more work is done in one Day, and with more PleaÅ¿ure, than could be done in two or three, having but indifferent ones, and yet worÅ¿e having bad ones.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides this, the Blade of theÅ¿e <hi>Pruning-Knives</hi> muÅ¿t be of a moderate length, that is, but about two Inches to the part where the bending of the back begins, and afterwards, the whole hooked part to the extremity of the point, muÅ¿t have two Inches more, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿omuch, that the extent of the outÅ¿ide, muÅ¿t not have above four Inches in all; beÅ¿ides this, the Handle muÅ¿t be more Å¿quare than round, and a little rugged: Buck's-Horn is very fit for it; this Handle muÅ¿t be of a reaÅ¿onable bigneÅ¿s, Å¿o as to Å¿it the hand, and to hold it firm without turning, or Å¿lipping out of it, in putting ones Å¿trength to it; the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48210:138"/>
thickneÅ¿s of two Inches and eight Lines, or at moÅ¿t three Inches, is that which is fit for the uÅ¿e of a Man who actually <hi>Prunes</hi> all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> that is, to cut here and there Å¿ome Å¿mall <hi>Branches:</hi> Such are fit for Gentlemen to have, to cut, as they are walking, Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> as they obÅ¿erve to be ill-plac'd. This is all I can Å¿ay of the Conditions of a good <hi>Pruning-Knife.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Saw,</hi> in my Opinion it does not require Å¿o much ado; however its moÅ¿t commendable quality is to be Å¿treight: It muÅ¿t be of a very hard Mettal, and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd; old blades of Swords are very fit for it, and the Teeth muÅ¿t be of a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and well open'd, the one turning towards one Å¿ide, the other on the 'tother, and the back muÅ¿t be very thin, or at leaÅ¿t not Å¿o thick nor Å¿o Å¿ubÅ¿tantial as the Teeth; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e the <hi>Saw</hi> will not move eaÅ¿ily, becauÅ¿e the Teeth will Å¿oon be fill'd up, Å¿o that it will Å¿oon tire him that uÅ¿es it, and make the Work advance but little.</p>
                        <p>It is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the <hi>Saws</hi> for the common uÅ¿e of <hi>Pruning</hi> Å¿hou'd be broad, half an Inch in breadth will Å¿uffice, they muÅ¿t not be very long neither, five or Å¿ix Inches in length will do; and as for the handle it may be round; Å¿ince it is to be puÅ¿h'd in a Å¿treight Line before one, that Å¿o its turning in the hand need not be fear'd, as a <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> with a Round Handle wou'd do. It will be thick enough, provided in that part where it is thickeÅ¿t, which is the Extremity, where the point of the Blade meets when it Å¿huts, it has about two Inches, and Å¿even or eight Lines Circumference; and on the other Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Å¿omewhat leÅ¿s than two Inches; and thus one Å¿hall have folding-Saws, which may be carry'd in the Pocket as eaÅ¿ily as the <hi>Pruning-Knives,</hi> the Blade cloÅ¿ing into the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which will be very Convenient, and very NeceÅ¿Å¿ary for a <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do think it a very great matter to have good Tools, but that is not enough, there is Å¿ome Skill requir'd to uÅ¿e them well, either for the expedition of BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, or to avoid Å¿ome Accidents. This is a PrentiÅ¿hip which generally coÅ¿ts Å¿ome blood to thoÅ¿e who begin to work, without having had good Directions. There are Å¿ome neceÅ¿Å¿ary Precautions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the manner of placing the whole Body well, and particularly of placing the left hand well, without which, a Learner is in great danger of hurting himÅ¿elf; therefore I think it very proper to InÅ¿truct him in it at firÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>To that end, I Å¿ay, firÅ¿t, that the PerÅ¿on muÅ¿t be diÅ¿pos'd and planted near his <hi>Tree,</hi> in Å¿uch a manner as to Å¿tand firm, Å¿o as to be able with eaÅ¿e to make uÅ¿e of his InÅ¿truments with his full Strength and Vigour: In the Å¿econd place, he muÅ¿t hold his Tools as firm as can be, that they may not turn in his hand: And, in the third place, as to his <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> he muÅ¿t always begin his <hi>Pruning,</hi> that is, to Cut, on that Å¿ide which is oppoÅ¿ite to the Eye, or the <hi>Branch</hi> upon which he cuts, which muÅ¿t after that make the extremity of the <hi>Branch</hi> which is cut: And in fine, whether he cuts to the Right, which is towards home, and is the moÅ¿t common; or whether he cuts with a back hand, as it is often neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and proper to be done, he muÅ¿t Å¿till take care, and uÅ¿e the precaution of putting his left hand underneath, and cloÅ¿e to the place which is to be cut, there to remain as it were fix'd, and to hold the part he graÅ¿ps Å¿o Å¿teady that it may not Å¿tir or move in the leaÅ¿t; and Å¿o conÅ¿equently reÅ¿iÅ¿t the force of the Right hand in cutting; otherwiÅ¿e if the left hand Å¿hould quit its hold, the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> would no doubt meet with it, and wound it dangerouÅ¿ly.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides this, that Right hand muÅ¿t be us'd, not only to hold the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> Å¿o, that the edge may be mov'd Flat-wiÅ¿e, and <hi>Horizontally,</hi> but alÅ¿o uÅ¿e it to Å¿top Å¿hort after the effort it has exerted in cutting, that you may cut nothing but the <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Root</hi> that you intend to Cut, without touching any of the Neighbouring ones, which muÅ¿t Å¿o care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be preÅ¿erv'd, as neither to be any wiÅ¿e Cut, or Wounded; and therefore before you come to preÅ¿ent the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> you muÅ¿t rightly obÅ¿erve the Situation of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Branches,</hi> and partly conÅ¿ider, not only how the hand muÅ¿t go in Cutting, for that hand in moving muÅ¿t give a certain turn to the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> that the Point may meet with nothing; but you muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e feel how far the force you muÅ¿t uÅ¿e to carry off at once the part you deÅ¿ign to remove may carry you, leÅ¿t the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> in its way might harm Å¿ome of the Neighbouring <hi>Branches;</hi> and this we call <hi>Cutting Dry,</hi> as it muÅ¿t be done to <hi>Prune</hi> well, that is to Cut cleverly; Å¿o that if it be a <hi>Branch,</hi> the Cut may be in Å¿ome manner round, and flat; at leaÅ¿t it muÅ¿t in no wiÅ¿e be long, as Unskilful People do it; and if it happen to be made long-wiÅ¿e, you muÅ¿t make uÅ¿e of your <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> again, to take away that Deformity; noting however, that it muÅ¿t be done in a different manner from <hi>Roots,</hi> which muÅ¿t be cut abÅ¿olutely like the Foot of a Hind, that is Å¿omewhat long-wiÅ¿e: We have given a ReaÅ¿on for it in the Chapter of <hi>Plantations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When by a frequent ExerciÅ¿e, or habit of <hi>Pruning,</hi> a Man is become handy, and bold in Cutting, he may very well, eÅ¿pecially in the CaÅ¿e of certain green <hi>Branches,</hi> thick enough to be taken away, I Å¿ay he may very well place his left hand above the right, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48210:138"/>
graÅ¿p, and gently bend Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> in drawing them towards him; and by that means, Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> will really prove more eaÅ¿ie to be Cut; in Å¿o much that a Man will often be Å¿urpriz'd to find Å¿o great a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿o eaÅ¿ily cut off at one Å¿troak; but then this Left Hand muÅ¿t be at Å¿uch a diÅ¿tance from the Right, that the great Å¿trength he muÅ¿t uÅ¿e to cut at once the <hi>Branch</hi> in queÅ¿tion, may not carry it as far as that Left Hand; and it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary to obÅ¿erve, that as in Cutting, the Right hand moves towards the Left, Å¿o that likewiÅ¿e Å¿hould move away from it, in carrying off, as I may call it, the Booty which the Right Hand has newly prepar'd for it; or otherwiÅ¿e, as we have already Å¿aid, that Left Hand wou'd run a great hazard of receiving a dangerous wound, which happens but too often.</p>
                        <p>Let us Å¿ay moreover, that in order to Cut well, every <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be within reach of him that Cuts it; in Å¿o much that he may be able to Cut it without Å¿training himÅ¿elf; that is, that Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hou'd reach up to the Å¿tomach of the <hi>Gard'ner:</hi> If it be much lower, he muÅ¿t be forc'd to Å¿toop Å¿o as to put one knee to the ground, if it be needful; and if that <hi>Branch</hi> be too high, he muÅ¿t get upon Å¿omething, either a Ladder, or Steps, to the end that he may Cut it with eaÅ¿e, and without Å¿training himÅ¿elf; for he would run a great bazard of hurting himÅ¿elf, or of Å¿plitting the <hi>Branch</hi> in cutting it downwards: It is not Å¿o dangerous to cut upwards; provided, as I have Å¿aid, the Left Hand be below the Right.</p>
                        <p>I may Å¿ay by the by, that <hi>Vine-Leaves</hi> are a Natural Balm to Å¿top the Blood of the Wounds a Man receives in <hi>Pruning,</hi> they take away the Pain, and cloÅ¿e up the Wound in a very little time. The tendereÅ¿t <hi>Leaves</hi> are commonly the beÅ¿t, and for want of green <hi>Leaves,</hi> the old ones may Å¿erve: I have formerly Experienc'd that Remedy, and often upon my Å¿elf; and have always found Å¿o much benefit by it, that I willingly adviÅ¿e our New <hi>VirtuoÅ¿o</hi>'s to uÅ¿e it upon occaÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Saw,</hi> thoÅ¿e that are to uÅ¿e it, muÅ¿t, contrary to what is done with the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Knife,</hi> as much as poÅ¿Å¿ibly can be, place the Left Hand above the Right, and lean hard upon the part which is to be Saw'd, to hinder it from Å¿tirring; otherwiÅ¿e the <hi>Saw</hi> would not play well. That done, they muÅ¿t hold the handle of the <hi>Saw</hi> in Å¿uch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the But-end may not reach above the middle of the Palm of the Hand, and juÅ¿t underneath the Thumb, where it muÅ¿t in Å¿ome manner be Å¿tay'd, or Å¿upported, to move the <hi>Saw</hi> the better; in order to which, it is likewiÅ¿e proper that the Fore-Finger Å¿hould be Å¿tretch'd along the Handle, as far as the edge of the Blade, to conduct the motion of the <hi>Saw</hi> the Å¿treighter; and to that end, is requir'd, in the firÅ¿t place, a conÅ¿iderable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Mind to what is to be Saw'd, without the leaÅ¿t diÅ¿traction by any thing; and at the Å¿ame time, the <hi>Saw</hi> muÅ¿t be manag'd with an extream quickneÅ¿s and Vigour; for working Å¿lowly, or thinking upon any thing elÅ¿e, the Work wou'd not Å¿ucceed well, and the <hi>Saw</hi> would often bend, or break: You muÅ¿t not Saw quite through, but Å¿top juÅ¿t cloÅ¿e to the laÅ¿t Bark, otherwiÅ¿e you might be in danger of tearing the Bark from off the remaining <hi>Branch,</hi> and conÅ¿equently peel it dangerouÅ¿ly; Å¿o that the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> muÅ¿t always end the work of the <hi>Saw,</hi> both to cut off clean what has not been made an end of Sawing, and to Å¿mooth the part that has been Saw'd; that is, to cut off all that remains rough from the Action of Sawing, Å¿ince otherwiÅ¿e it would hardly recover, the <hi>Saw</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Å¿ome manner burnt the part Å¿o Saw'd.</p>
                        <p>There are likewiÅ¿e certain OccaÅ¿ions, in which the Left Hand, by gently bending the <hi>Branch</hi> to be Saw'd, makes the Saw play the better; and Å¿ooner, and more neatly finiÅ¿hes the Work: But you muÅ¿t be very exact in the Å¿trength you uÅ¿e, or apply in bending, leÅ¿t you Å¿hould make a dangerous Slit in the part that is to remain. This is what I had to Å¿ay, as to our Tools; let us now proceed to the application of the uÅ¿e that is to be made of them.</p>

                           <p>Of the firÅ¿t Pruning of a <hi>Tree</hi> that has not Sprouted at all the firÅ¿t Year.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS to the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, in which we Å¿uppoÅ¿e the <hi>Tree</hi> to have Å¿hot forth nothing the firÅ¿t Year, perhaps it may be dead, and appears viÅ¿ibly Å¿o; and perhaps it is really dead, tho' it does not Å¿eem to be Å¿o, by reaÅ¿on of a little Green which the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> diÅ¿covers under the Bark; for without doubt it may Å¿eem alive at the Head, and yet be dead at the <hi>Root,</hi> and that is likewiÅ¿e call'd being quite dead, without however appearing Å¿o outwardly; or elÅ¿e it may Å¿eem dead, either becauÅ¿e it has produc'd nothing, or perhaps becauÅ¿e part of the <hi>Stem</hi> is really dead, tho' it be no wiÅ¿e dead in the Principal Place, which is the Place of the Principle of Life, and of the thick <hi>Roots,</hi> on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the whole Spring of <hi>Vegetation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Tree</hi> is dead on all Å¿ides, it is eaÅ¿ily known by the dryneÅ¿s, or blackneÅ¿s either of the whole <hi>Stem,</hi> or a main part of it; eÅ¿pecially if that blackneÅ¿s appears about the <hi>Graff;</hi> in which CaÅ¿e it is neither difficult of giving, nor of receiving good Advice; that is, Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t be remov'd as Å¿oon as you are convinc'd of its being Dead, but ever with an intention of putting another in the room of it, at the firÅ¿t moderate Shower of Rain: Provided the death of Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> be perceiv'd in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 'till which time you may plant others in the room of it; but it is not Å¿o Å¿afe to be done during the reÅ¿t of the Summer.</p>
                        <p>This Re-implacement Å¿ufficiently Å¿hews, that I deÅ¿ign it Å¿hould be done by means of thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> which are brought up in Baskets; if, as I have Å¿o much exhorted People to do, the Curious have taken care to raiÅ¿e Å¿ome in that manner, not only in the firÅ¿t year of their Planting, but likewiÅ¿e all the following years; to the end that this firÅ¿t year, and even at all times they may have the Å¿atisfaction of Å¿eeing their <hi>Garden</hi> perfectly Stock'd: Without doubt Å¿uch Basket <hi>Trees</hi> in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> would have Å¿hot their <hi>Roots</hi> beyond the Baskets, in caÅ¿e they had taken Å¿o well, as to produce very fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> which are the only ones you muÅ¿t re-implace, but it is very dangerous to take them out, to TranÅ¿port or Plant them in the Summer, when their <hi>Roots</hi> are thus Å¿hot out; for they either break in removing, or as their Extremities are <hi>White,</hi> they eaÅ¿ily blacken in a hot Air, and conÅ¿equently periÅ¿h; and cauÅ¿e the <hi>Tree</hi> to pine long, and even often kills it.</p>
                        <p>But if you do not uÅ¿e Baskets in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> you muÅ¿t Å¿tay until the return of the next SeaÅ¿on of Planting, which is from <hi>November,</hi> to the middle of <hi>March,</hi> and then they may be us'd; or having none, you muÅ¿t Re-plant a new <hi>Tree</hi> well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd, in the Room of that which is dead.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time we muÅ¿t carefully examine how we happen'd to be deceiv'd in that <hi>Tree,</hi> in which we had obÅ¿erv'd all the appearances of a better fortune; Å¿ince without that it Å¿hould not have been <hi>Planted,</hi> to the end that if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible to diÅ¿cover or avoid the Inconveniencies that have kill'd it, we may endeavour to remedy it for the future.</p>
                        <p>For Example, it may be the great Cold during the Winter, which happens but Å¿eldom, <note place="margin">FunduÅ¿que mendax Arbore nunc aquas cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pante, nunc tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente agros Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera. <hi>Horatius</hi>

                        <p>If the <hi>Tree</hi> remain green in the whole <hi>Stem,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t in a great part of it, without having produc'd any thing, and that perhaps it be only a kind of <hi>Lethargy,</hi> which has in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure benum'd the <hi>Vegetative Faculty,</hi> as it happens to Å¿ome <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> newly Planted, which remain Å¿ometimes two, three, or four years without coming to any thing, and yet at laÅ¿t perform Wonders. 'Tis Å¿trange and difficult to apprehend, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> which in effect are Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to take, and yet are Å¿o hard to dye, Å¿hou'd not withÅ¿tanding be Å¿o difficult to be mov'd to begin Å¿ome <hi>Roots:</hi> But this is not the Point in queÅ¿tion here; our <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> are not Å¿o long without Å¿hewing the certainty of their Life or Death.</p>
                        <p>In caÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, this <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> has preÅ¿erv'd its greenneÅ¿s all the Summer, without producing any <hi>Shoots;</hi> it may perhaps give Å¿ome hope of Å¿atisfaction for the time to come, but indeed that hope is very Å¿light; and if it may be done conveniently, the Å¿ureÅ¿t way is to replant as Å¿oon as can be another new one, that appears better, or at leaÅ¿t equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good in the room of it; but if no other can be had, I am Å¿till of Opinion that it will be proper in the Month of <hi>November</hi> to Å¿earch round about that Å¿uÅ¿picious <hi>Foot,</hi> to Å¿ee whether there appears any good beginning of thick <hi>Roots,</hi> or none at all.</p>
                        <p>In the FirÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, that is, if any good Signs be diÅ¿cover'd, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in the beginning or growing of Å¿ome thick <hi>Roots,</hi> which is very extraordinary; for as Å¿oon as any new <hi>Roots</hi> grow in Summer, new <hi>Shoots</hi> appear at the Å¿ame time: If then, I Å¿ay, any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thick <hi>Roots</hi> be diÅ¿cover'd, which perhaps only began to form themÅ¿elves Å¿ince the end of Summer, you muÅ¿t reÅ¿t there, without doing any thing more, and only cover the Place well again where you have open'd the Ground; and beÅ¿ides, the following Summer take Å¿ome extraordinary Carefrom time to time to Water it, if the Ground and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on Å¿eem to requireit: Such a <hi>Tree</hi> may very well make up the time it has loÅ¿t, and become fine the following years.</p>
                        <p>In the Second CaÅ¿e, that is when the <hi>Tree</hi> has perform'd nothing by its <hi>Root,</hi> it muÅ¿t be wholly taken out of the Ground, and <hi>Prun'd</hi> again, that is, according to the Term of a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> all its <hi>Roots</hi> muÅ¿t be refreÅ¿h'd, doing the Å¿ame to the Head, of which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity may perhaps be dead; and in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e it muÅ¿t be refreÅ¿h'd as far as the quick, and then the <hi>Tree</hi> may be re-planted at that very time, and in the Å¿ame place, if it be judg'd worth it, having preÅ¿erv'd its <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿ound and entire, or you muÅ¿t fling it quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if the principal <hi>Roots</hi> be defective, either in being dry, or black, or being actually rotten, or gnaw'd, as it happens Å¿ometimes, for in that CaÅ¿e no good can be expected from them: The CaÅ¿e is different, when there are only Å¿ome Å¿mall <hi>Roots</hi> tainted, tho' it be not a good Sign: but however, in that CaÅ¿e it wou'd be Å¿ufficient to Cut them again to the quick, and Re-plant the <hi>Tree</hi> in the Å¿ame place where it has given CauÅ¿e to believe its DeÅ¿tiny doubtful: I have pretty often Re-planted Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> where they have thriven Å¿o well, that Å¿ome years after I have Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully given them Å¿ome of the Chief Places of the <hi>Garden,</hi> and yet I had Planted very good new <hi>Trees</hi> in the Places where thoÅ¿e could not thrive: It is very difficult to have perfect <hi>Plantations</hi> without all thoÅ¿e neceÅ¿Å¿ary ConÅ¿iderations.</p>
                        <p>The CoolneÅ¿s of a moiÅ¿t <hi>Ground</hi> is Å¿ometimes Å¿ufficient to preÅ¿erve for a year, or more, uncertain Å¿igns of Life, both in the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Stem</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> as well as it preÅ¿erves it in Cut <hi>Branches,</hi> and yet without any certainty of their performing afterwards any happy <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> that is, to <hi>Operate</hi> in the Å¿ame manner as well qualify'd <hi>Trees</hi> uÅ¿e to do; therefore

it is fit to be very nice upon thoÅ¿e kind of appearances of Life, by which Å¿o many People Å¿uffer themÅ¿elves to be amuz'd and deceiv'd for Å¿o many Years. This is, what I had to Å¿ay upon thoÅ¿e appearances of Life, whether Good and Certain, or Ill and Doubtful.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Upon which I declare, that I have but little more value for that <hi>Tree,</hi> than for the Preceeding, which we have juÅ¿t examin'd, and found it either quite Dead, as well in the <hi>Roots,</hi> as in the <hi>Stem,</hi> or only dead as to the <hi>Roots,</hi> tho' it appear'd green at the Bark; or elÅ¿e have found it to have yet Å¿ome Å¿mall Å¿igns of Life in the <hi>Roots,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Stem;</hi> both theÅ¿e, and the others, having Å¿till preÅ¿erv'd Å¿ome Å¿igns of Life; that is, Å¿ome green, and a little <hi>Sap.</hi> Therefore when I am furniÅ¿h'd with good <hi>Trees,</hi> I never fail reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, altho' it has Å¿prouted a little, as well as the preceeding which has not Å¿prouted at all: But when I find my Å¿elf in want, or unprovided, I am contented with cutting theÅ¿e little <hi>Shoots</hi> cloÅ¿e to the <hi>Stem,</hi> Å¿hortning that above by the half; and beÅ¿ides, I never fail to Å¿earch the Foot; and if I find that the <hi>Roots</hi> have <hi>Shot</hi> nothing, as it happens Å¿ometime, I pluck up the <hi>Tree</hi> quite, and refreÅ¿h the <hi>Roots,</hi> to Å¿ee if they are all Å¿ound; which being Å¿o, I plant them again, or elÅ¿e Å¿ome of the Principals being Å¿poil'd, I fling it away.</p>
                        <p>If in order to Replant Å¿uch a <hi>Tree,</hi> I fear the <hi>Earth</hi> be not good enough, I put better in the room of it, this is the only good expedient to be us'd; the help of <hi>Dung</hi> being too uncertain and deceitful to rely upon it: In fine, I do the Å¿ame thing to this <hi>Tree,</hi> as I do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that, which did nothing, but remain'd Green both at the Head and <hi>Roots,</hi> which we <hi>Prun'd</hi> anew every where, and afterwards Replanted, either in the <hi>Garden,</hi> or in the <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ery;</hi> or elÅ¿e like the other, whoÅ¿e Head is really in a pretty good Condition, that is Green, but yet has its principal <hi>Roots</hi> entirely Å¿poil'd, which, upon that account, we have rejected as dead therefore I ev'n look for a new <hi>Tree,</hi> to put in the room of that, which, as it were, only Å¿eem'd to Sprout, Å¿uch little <hi>Shoots</hi> being properly but falÅ¿e marks of its having taken new <hi>Root,</hi> they being only produc'd by the effect of <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the <hi>Roots,</hi> as I explain elÅ¿ewhere.</p>
                        <p>That pitiful <hi>Fruit-Bud,</hi> which appears upon the languiÅ¿hing Head of that <hi>Tree</hi> newly Planted, far from producing in me the effect it operates upon Å¿o many <hi>PhiloÅ¿ophers;</hi> that is, from raiÅ¿ing any Joy in me, or giving me the leaÅ¿t ConÅ¿ideration, either for the Father that has brought it to light, or for the Action by which it is produc'd, creates in me on the contrary, a real Å¿corn for both; which confirming me in the Maxims I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, to prove that <hi>Fruits</hi> are only marks of weakneÅ¿s, puts me upon the reÅ¿olution of forÅ¿aking that <hi>Tree,</hi> and to fling it away like a piece of dead or uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Wood:</hi> This I do not only to low <hi>Trees,</hi> that are to make <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or part of the <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e to <hi>Standards,</hi> both the one and the other being a-like, in reÅ¿pect to their taking new <hi>Root.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will Å¿ay here by the by, that this deÅ¿picable <hi>Bud,</hi> which I think I may call a <hi>Bud</hi> of Poverty, has rais'd a War between Å¿ome <hi>PhiloÅ¿ophers</hi> and I, becauÅ¿e I will not grant them, that the <hi>Production</hi> of it is a Å¿ign of Vigour in the <hi>Tree,</hi> as commonly the Generation of Animals, is a mark of it in the Fathers.</p>

                           <p>Of the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> that has at leaÅ¿t produc'd one fine <hi>Branch.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE muÅ¿t now proceed to the Third Article, which relates to our low <hi>Trees,</hi> newly Planted, either for a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> and declare what we are to do if they Sprout reaÅ¿onably; that is, at leaÅ¿t one Beautiful, and Å¿ufficiently thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which is commonly attended with Å¿ome weak ones.</p>
                        <p>In that caÅ¿e, we are to make <hi>Three</hi> particular ConÅ¿iderations, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether that fine <hi>Branch</hi> proceeds from the extremity of the <hi>Stem,</hi> the middle, or the lower part.</p>
                        <p>If altogether from the extremity, out of the fear of falling into the inconvenience I dread, which is a defect for a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> that is, its growing too high in the <hi>Stem,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which inconvenience I Å¿hould undoubtedly fall; if I perform'd my <hi>Pruning</hi> upon that new <hi>Shoot,</hi> I rather reÅ¿olve to Å¿horten the <hi>Stem</hi> of that young <hi>Tree</hi> about an Inch or two, and Å¿o put it back to the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> Being certain, that round the extremity where I Å¿hall lower it, it will produce fine new <hi>Branches,</hi> all well plac'd, and in a Å¿ufficient Number; and this is grounded upon that fine <hi>Shoot</hi> it has produc'd, which convinces me fully, that it has Å¿hot forth good <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus in putting back perhaps the PleaÅ¿ure of a Year, becauÅ¿e I run the hazard of having my <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿omewhat later; I avoid the diÅ¿Å¿atisfaction of having a <hi>Tree</hi> riÅ¿e too high, as it would do, if I permitted it wholly to <hi>Shoot</hi> out of that <hi>Branch,</hi> which would offend me perpetually, whereas in taking it a little lower, I put it in a way of appearing with all the advantage that can be deÅ¿ir'd in a well order'd <hi>Tree;</hi> and conÅ¿equently I put it in a condition of rewarding me yet better, as well by a fine Figure, as by the pleaÅ¿ure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the fine <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hoot out of the middle of the <hi>Stem,</hi> you muÅ¿t without heÅ¿ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cut down the <hi>Stem</hi> to that <hi>Branch,</hi> and even Å¿horten that <hi>Branch</hi> within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿s of four or five Eyes at moÅ¿t, therein to place the whole foundation, and all the hope of a Beautiful figure in your <hi>Tree;</hi> it being certain, that at the place where you have Å¿horten'd it, it will produce in the Å¿econd Year at leaÅ¿t two fine <hi>Branches,</hi> oppoÅ¿ite to each other: This is Å¿ufficient to make a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> for thoÅ¿e who know how to order it well; but if that Å¿horten'd <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hoots forth three or four, as it happens pretty often, the Å¿ucceÅ¿s will Å¿till be the more favourable, eaÅ¿ie, and agreeable.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e Å¿till, that the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> who are any thing careful, will have taken care to order that only <hi>Branch</hi> we Å¿peak of, in Å¿uch a manner, that it may be very upright, in order to form a Å¿treight <hi>Tree</hi> upon its Center, as it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary it Å¿hould be.</p>
                        <p>If they have been wanting as to that Precaution, they muÅ¿t have recourÅ¿e to the grand Remedy, which is, to Å¿horten that <hi>Branch</hi> within the compaÅ¿s of two or three Eyes, which rough Treatment had not been neceÅ¿Å¿ary, had it been well rear'd up from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Pruning</hi> that <hi>Branch,</hi> which is come here by its Å¿elf, one may Å¿till preÅ¿erve, not the very Å¿mall <hi>Branches</hi> which I call <hi>SappleÅ¿s,</hi> and muÅ¿t be utterly exterminated from our new planted <hi>Tree;</hi> but only Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e that are either Å¿hort, or paÅ¿Å¿ably thick, or longiÅ¿h, and likewiÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ably thick, in whatever place either of them may be; provided they have pretty good <hi>Eyes,</hi> and are well plac'd, we may Å¿ecurely expect to have Å¿oon <hi>Fruit</hi> upon them, without fearing it might prejudice the vigour of our <hi>Tree,</hi> eÅ¿pecially in Å¿tone <hi>Fruit,</hi> and even in Kernel <hi>Fruit,</hi> taking care however to Å¿horten thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> a little, which are really too long, without medling with the others that are Å¿hort and paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ably thick.</p>
                        <p>The ReaÅ¿on why I do not hinder the preÅ¿erving of Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e weak <hi>Branches,</hi> is, that being very certain, as I have Å¿o often repeated, that it is the Å¿mall quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> which produces the <hi>Fruit,</hi> it follows from thence, that the little <hi>Sap</hi> that goes towards the making of it, cannot conÅ¿iderably prejudice our new <hi>Tree,</hi> and yet it will afford us a great deal of PleaÅ¿ure in giving us <hi>Fruit</hi> betimes.</p>
                        <p>It is not that I think it a great fault, the firÅ¿t Year, unmercifully to take away all thoÅ¿e hopes of the <hi>FirÅ¿t Fruits:</hi> The Curious may do in this as they think fit, but for my part, I preÅ¿erve them.</p>
                        <p>If our only <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hoots out of the lower part of the <hi>Stem,</hi> we have ReaÅ¿on to rejoice at it, it is very well plac'd, provided the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> has taken care of it betimes, to keep
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48210:142"/>
it upright, in caÅ¿e it were not Å¿o, as we have Å¿aid of the Preceeding: We may with aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>Prune</hi> it the heighth we deÅ¿ire it at, to begin a Fine <hi>Tree,</hi> whether it be a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Tree;</hi> but if it prove not Å¿treight, or without a probability of being Å¿treightned by Å¿ome Å¿trong Ligature, it muÅ¿t be us'd like the other, that is, it muÅ¿t be Å¿horten'd quite low to make it produce another that may be Å¿treight, otherwiÅ¿e the <hi>Tree</hi> would always be a-wry, and conÅ¿equently of an ill Figure, Å¿till remembring that the <hi>Stem</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿horten'd cloÅ¿e to the Å¿ingle <hi>Branch</hi> it has produc'd, and we have <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will Å¿ay here, by the by, that when we Plant a <hi>Tree,</hi> we may according to appearances, but not demonÅ¿tratively and infallibly aÅ¿Å¿ure that it will take <hi>Root:</hi> Yet leÅ¿s, in caÅ¿e it do's, can we aÅ¿Å¿ign in what part it will produce its firÅ¿t <hi>Shoot:</hi> But as for the Fine <hi>Branches</hi> produc'd by a <hi>Tree</hi> that has taken <hi>Root,</hi> which we have afterwards <hi>Prun'd,</hi> we may with Å¿ome certainty affirm, that they will produce New ones on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities on them which we have Å¿horten'd, and partly gueÅ¿s at the quantity; Å¿o that this may be rely'd upon; and conÅ¿equently if our <hi>Tree</hi> has only produc'd the Å¿ingle <hi>Branch</hi> we Å¿peak of, we may with certainty expect that being <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿omewhat Å¿hort, it will at leaÅ¿t Å¿hoot two fine ones, capable of performing in all reÅ¿pects what we have above eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for the beginning of the Beautiful Figure of a <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>We are to make other great ConÅ¿iderations upon them, which will engage us into different Chapters, <hi>Viz.</hi> In the firÅ¿t place, to know whether that Plurality of <hi>Branches</hi> be produc'd to ones liking; That is, whether they grow round about Å¿ome part of the <hi>Stem,</hi> whether at the top, in the middle, or in the lower part; Å¿o that they may grow like a <hi>Branch-CandleÅ¿tick,</hi> for a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or like a Hand Å¿pread open for a <hi>Wall-Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To know, in the Å¿econd place, whether all thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> are grown on one Å¿ide, and all over one another.</p>
                        <p>Or whether in Degrees at a great diÅ¿tance from each other, tho' round about the <hi>Stem,</hi> or if Å¿ometimes they are all grown from one and the Å¿ame <hi>Eye,</hi> and likewiÅ¿e whether it be on the top, middle, or lower part of the <hi>Stem.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>TheÅ¿e are almoÅ¿t all the different ways in which the firÅ¿t Å¿hort <hi>Shoots</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> newly Planted form themÅ¿elves, when it is Å¿o happy as to take <hi>Root</hi> again, as it appears by the Figures hereunto annex'd.</p>
                        <p>I repeat again, that I do not ConÅ¿ider here, as any thing ConÅ¿iderable, the little Å¿mall <hi>Branches,</hi> altho' they Å¿hould be good to produce <hi>Fruit</hi> the very next year, which is often true in Stone <hi>Fruit,</hi> but Å¿eldom in Kernel <hi>Fruit:</hi> Woe to that <hi>Tree,</hi> what ever it be, which produces many of theÅ¿e, or no others; however, I will Å¿ay what is fit to be done to them, after having ended the moÅ¿t material part of my Work.</p>
                        <p>They are only the great <hi>Branches</hi> I value in this CaÅ¿e, deÅ¿iring to have a fine and good <hi>Tree;</hi> theÅ¿e, in reÅ¿pect to this, have been the firÅ¿t Object of my WiÅ¿hes, and the only ones that can Å¿erve for the firÅ¿t foundation of my <hi>Tree,</hi> that is, in caÅ¿e they be Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well plac'd, and I can give them a <hi>Pruning</hi> proper for my Intention, and for the Beauty of the <hi>Tree</hi> I am to manage.</p>
                        <p>For as the firÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> tho' happy in their Original, may very well be ill order'd, and conÅ¿equently give an ill beginning to a <hi>Tree,</hi> being handled by an Unskilful Hand; Å¿o likewiÅ¿e tho' thoÅ¿e firrÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> at their firÅ¿t Sprouting, might happen to be found in a defective Situation, may very well with a little time, and good diÅ¿cipline be, as I have Å¿aid, Å¿o Skilfully turn'd, that the defect of their Birth may not hinder them from being Mothers to a Well-Å¿hap'd, and Sightly <hi>Tree.</hi>

The firÅ¿t Caution I am to give here, is, that commonly all the thick <hi>Branches</hi> which grow the firÅ¿t year upon new <hi>Trees,</hi> are thoÅ¿e we call <hi>Branches</hi> of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> their <hi>Eyes</hi> diÅ¿cover it; and therefore muÅ¿t be Treated accordingly by <hi>Pruning,</hi> and even the weak and Å¿lender ones are commonly in that reÅ¿pect of the Å¿ame Form with the thick ones, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s they did remain very Å¿hort.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd AdvertiÅ¿ement, is, that the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> I perform upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of New <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> differs but little from that I uÅ¿e the firÅ¿t year upon New <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> It is true, that in theÅ¿e I eaÅ¿ily conÅ¿train the moÅ¿t obÅ¿tinate <hi>Branches,</hi> that is the worÅ¿t grown, to put themÅ¿elves into the PoÅ¿ture I deÅ¿ire, to attain the Beauty requir'd in a <hi>Wali-Tree;</hi> it Å¿erves likewiÅ¿e to afford me more <hi>Fruit,</hi> and finer; it is likewiÅ¿e true, that <hi>Dwarfs</hi> are, if that ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion may be us'd, a kind of half Volunteers, which indeed do part of what they have a mind to themÅ¿elves; but yet commonly Å¿uffer themÅ¿elves at the Å¿ame time, to be conducted by my InduÅ¿try, as well for the Å¿atisfaction of my Eyes, as for the delight of my Pallate: Only the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> can not be left Å¿o long upon <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> as upon <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> becauÅ¿e in thoÅ¿e we have the Convenience of <hi>Tacking</hi> and <hi>Propping,</hi> which we have not in others.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>AS for what relates then to this Fourth CaÅ¿e, in which a <hi>Tree</hi> newly Planted has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and vigorouÅ¿ly produc'd more than one Fine <hi>Branch,</hi> with Å¿ome weak ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: If, for inÅ¿tance, it has on the top of the <hi>Stem</hi> two almoÅ¿t equally Å¿trong, and well plac'd, that is one on one Å¿ide, and another on the other, nothing can hardly be deÅ¿ir'd better, it is a very fair beginning to make a Fine <hi>Tree:</hi> The only thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion is, to Å¿horten them all equally within the compaÅ¿s of five or Å¿ix Inches in length: But above all, you muÅ¿t take care that the two laÅ¿t <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Extremity of each of theÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿o Å¿horten'd, look on the Right, and on the Left, upon the two bare Å¿ides, to the end, that each of them producing at leaÅ¿t two new ones, theÅ¿e four may be Å¿o well plac'd, that they may be all preÅ¿erv'd; and in order to that, if it be a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> they muÅ¿t all contribute to form the thin Round which we deÅ¿ire; and if it be a <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> to form the flat and full Round, which we likewiÅ¿e deÅ¿ign.</p>
                        <p>It would be ill <hi>Pruning,</hi> if thoÅ¿e two laÅ¿t <hi>Eyes</hi> look'd, for Example, either on the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Dwarf</hi> to begin to fill it, or the outÅ¿ide to begin to open too much; it being firÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd well to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the firÅ¿t Beauty of the Figure of that <hi>Tree,</hi> which is to open in a Round equally garniÅ¿h'd: For the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿on, in relation to the <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Pruning</hi> would not be Å¿ufficiently well perform'd, unleÅ¿s it were order'd Å¿o, that the two <hi>Eyes</hi> that are to be found on the Extremities of the two <hi>Branches</hi> that are to be Å¿horten'd, Å¿hould caÅ¿t upon oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ides the New <hi>Branches</hi> they are able to produce: for it is neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary that thoÅ¿e very <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hould have of themÅ¿elves, and without the leaÅ¿t violence a Natural diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to place themÅ¿elves well upon thoÅ¿e parts of the Wall that we would cover, to the end that they may all be preÅ¿erv'd; and Å¿o the firÅ¿t Vigorous <hi>Branches</hi> of that <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> have perform'd their duty, as well as the firÅ¿t Vigorous ones of the firÅ¿t <hi>Dwarf</hi> will have done theirs: However, it will Å¿till be fitting to have Å¿uch neceÅ¿Å¿ary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards both towards the one and the other, as may tend firÅ¿t, and chiefly, to a RoundneÅ¿s, which muÅ¿t be continu'd to that end, until the Round be almoÅ¿t perfect, and then we muÅ¿t begin to have two other ProÅ¿pects to dwell upon; of which, the one is, to endeavour by all poÅ¿Å¿ible means to give a reaÅ¿onable opening to that <hi>Tree,</hi> if it be a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attain'd its roundneÅ¿s; and to fill it equally throughout its whole extent, if it be a <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> likewiÅ¿e having its roundneÅ¿s; The other ProÅ¿pect is, to preÅ¿erve in both that Round which is already form'd, and muÅ¿t yearly grow in Circumference, without ever, as much as in us lies, Å¿uffering it to loÅ¿e any thing of the Beauty of its Figure.</p>
                        <p>A particular Care muÅ¿t be taken, that if one of thoÅ¿e two <hi>Branches</hi> has any advantage in thickneÅ¿s over the other, Å¿o that likely the one may well produce two other thick ones, while his Neighbour can yield but one; in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, care muÅ¿t be taken, that as well the two of the thickeÅ¿t, as the Å¿ingle one of that which is not Å¿o thick, may come forth Å¿o happily, that all three together may be preÅ¿erv'd as fit and neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing of the Beautiful Figure in queÅ¿tion: OtherwiÅ¿e, if there Å¿hould be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of

removing Å¿ome, becauÅ¿e ill-favouredly grown, it would prove a vexatious LoÅ¿s, both in reÅ¿pect to the <hi>Tree,</hi> and <hi>Gard'ner.</hi> It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿ay here, that if, in theÅ¿e two kind of <hi>Trees</hi> in debate, a <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> Å¿hou'd chance to be joyn'd to the two <hi>Wood-Branches,</hi> it may be preÅ¿erv'd without any ConÅ¿equence.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IF one of thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t fine <hi>Branches</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> has produc'd, be conÅ¿iderably lower than the other, or perhaps both on the Å¿ame Å¿ide; or may be the one on one Å¿ide on the top of the Extremity, and the other quite at the bottom of the oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide; in that CaÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, you muÅ¿t fiercely and unmercifully reÅ¿olve to preÅ¿erve but one, and chuÅ¿e the fitteÅ¿t to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a fine Figure; and conÅ¿equently, you muÅ¿t cut off the other Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it may never be able to produce any thick ones in the Å¿ame place; it being moÅ¿t certain, that if both were preÅ¿erv'd, it cou'd never form a <hi>Tree</hi> of an agreeable Figure, the Å¿ight of which wou'd continually vex you, for not having order'd it well from its Infancy. The Ignorant perhaps may imagine, that this wou'd occaÅ¿ion the loÅ¿s of a Year; but I can aÅ¿Å¿ure them of the contrary, if they will confide in me. In this CaÅ¿e then you muÅ¿t take down the <hi>Tree</hi> to the loweÅ¿t <hi>branch,</hi> if you deÅ¿ign to preÅ¿erve that, which, indeed, is the moÅ¿t proper for our DeÅ¿ign, and an infallible Means not to fear any other <hi>Branch</hi> ill-plac'd on that Å¿ide: Or, if you muÅ¿t take off the loweÅ¿t, as not being fit to contribute to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> it muÅ¿t be cut within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown-piece; for there Å¿eldom ariÅ¿es a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of cutting a thick new <hi>Branch,</hi> being ill-plac'd Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all may grow from it. I explain this Å¿ort of <hi>Pruning,</hi> together with that which is to be perform'd Å¿loping, more at large in the 21. Chapter.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Pruning</hi> within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown-piece, will either produce nothing, or only weak <hi>Branches,</hi> which, far from Å¿poiling any thing, will be fit to be preÅ¿erv'd for <hi>Fruit.</hi> This way of <hi>Pruning</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿es the <hi>Branch</hi> to be thick and vigorous; for had it been a moderate one, it muÅ¿t have been preÅ¿erv'd entire, as a <hi>Fruit-Branch;</hi> if very thin, it muÅ¿t have been cut Å¿o cloÅ¿e to the <hi>Stem,</hi> that no paÅ¿Å¿age had remain'd for any thing new; and that particularly, it being very ill-plac'd, or the <hi>Tree</hi> having but a moderate Vigour.</p>
                        <p>This CaÅ¿e of a Å¿ingle <hi>Branch,</hi> which has been preÅ¿erv'd, and muÅ¿t be <hi>prun'd,</hi> reduces it Å¿elf to another heretofore explain'd, where our <hi>Tree</hi> at firÅ¿t produc'd but one fine <hi>Branch;</hi> and conÅ¿equently, in order to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of this, you muÅ¿t follow the Method preÅ¿crib'd for the other, which is uÅ¿eleÅ¿s to repeat here.</p>
                        <p>It happens Å¿ometimes, that from one and the Å¿ame <hi>Eye</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> newly planted, two fair <hi>Branches</hi> may proceed, without any others from any other part. In Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, they may both be preÅ¿erv'd very well, whatever part of the <hi>Stem</hi> they are in; that is, if they are likely to Å¿erve to form a beautiful Figure, as it is poÅ¿Å¿ible, if the Vigour of the <hi>Foot,</hi> or the Care of the <hi>Gardner,</hi> have made them Å¿hoot Å¿treight upwards: But if either of them cannot Å¿erve towards that Figure, it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to take it away, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that, of which a good uÅ¿e may be made; and that muÅ¿t be order'd according to the foregoing Method upon that Subject.</p>

                        <p>But if thoÅ¿e three or four fine <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hoot out a little below the Extremity, 'tis but Å¿hortning the <hi>Stem</hi> to them, and then do what I have been Å¿aying, when the Branches did at firÅ¿t Å¿hoot out from the top of the <hi>Stem.</hi>

It wou'd be a good Fortune if they Å¿hou'd be all Å¿o happily plac'd, that they might be all preÅ¿erv'd, without cauÅ¿ing any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, as I have met with it Å¿ometimes; by which means it is eaÅ¿ie to have Å¿oon a fine and good <hi>Tree.</hi> But as it is a Rarety to find them all well plac'd, I am of opinion, that it will be Å¿ufficient to preÅ¿erve three or four of thoÅ¿e, that a skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> Å¿hall judge, both by their Å¿ituation and Å¿trength, to be the fitteÅ¿t for the Execution of our DeÅ¿ign, and Å¿o <hi>Prune</hi> them, as we have explain'd in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e. This being Å¿o, he muÅ¿t wholly cut off all the others, if they happen to be higher than thoÅ¿e that are preÅ¿erv'd, eÅ¿pecially if they be thick; for if they are weak, that is, fit for <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> he will do well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve them until they have perform'd what they are capable of doing.</p>
                        <p>In caÅ¿e then there be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of taking away Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e higheÅ¿t that are thick, they muÅ¿t either be cut off <hi>Stump-wiÅ¿e,</hi> to amuÅ¿e a little <hi>Sap</hi> in them during two or three Years, or elÅ¿e the <hi>Stem</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿horten'd to them that are preÅ¿erv'd; eÅ¿pecially, the <hi>Tree</hi> not being very vigorous. But if there happen to be Å¿ome thick ones lower than thoÅ¿e which we preÅ¿erve for ever, it is likewiÅ¿e convenient to preÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e low ones for a while, provided they Å¿poil nothing in the Figure; becauÅ¿e that for the Å¿pace of two or three Years, they employ a little of that <hi>Sap,</hi> the Abundance of which is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to us, both to compaÅ¿s <hi>Fruit,</hi> and to arrive at a beautiful Figure. But if Å¿uch low <hi>Branches</hi> can annoy us, then, as we have already Å¿aid, they muÅ¿t be cut within the

thickneÅ¿s of a Crown-piece, or elÅ¿e take them off cloÅ¿e, when we find but a moderate Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the Foot of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Å¿till forewarn, that if, among the thick ones, there chance to be a great many weak ones, you muÅ¿t be contented with two or three of thoÅ¿e that are beÅ¿t plac'd, and beÅ¿t condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, breaking off the Extremity of the longeÅ¿t a little, and not medling with thoÅ¿e that are naturally Å¿hort, and paÅ¿Å¿ably thick; and conÅ¿equently, you muÅ¿t wholly take away the others, which would only cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p>This, in my Opinion, is all that can be done for the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees;</hi> I mean, for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the firÅ¿t <hi>Branches</hi> they Å¿hall have produc'd, in the place where they have been newly <hi>Planted.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of thoÅ¿e New <hi>Planted Trees</hi> being perform'd, and that upon the firÅ¿t <hi>Shoots</hi> they have produc'd the firÅ¿t Year of their being <hi>Planted,</hi> we now muÅ¿t Å¿hew the SucceÅ¿s it ought apparently to produce, and what Conduct is to be held the following Year for the Å¿econd <hi>Pruning;</hi> I mean, for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the <hi>Twigs,</hi> that Å¿hall Å¿hoot from the Extremity of thoÅ¿e that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> the Year before: And to that End, I think it will be proper to follow the Å¿ame Order I have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for the firÅ¿t; that is, for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the firÅ¿t <hi>Shoots</hi> they had produc'd.</p>
                        <p>But before I come to that, let us conÅ¿ider what is to be done to the <hi>Trees</hi> which had not Å¿ucceeded well the firÅ¿t Year.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Fruit-Tree,</hi> which, without having produc'd any <hi>Branches</hi> the firÅ¿t Year, has been preÅ¿erve'd, in hopes that, having Å¿till been green, and conÅ¿equently alive, it might do better the Å¿econd; I Å¿ay, if that <hi>Tree</hi> does not begin betimes, that is, even in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> to Å¿hoot very vigorouÅ¿ly, it is an infallible Sign, that it will never be good for any thing; and therefore, without loÅ¿ing any more Time, it muÅ¿t be thrown away, and one of thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall have been brought up in Baskets, in order to Å¿upply Å¿uch Accidents, plac'd in the room of it.</p>
                        <p>And likewiÅ¿e, if the <hi>Tree,</hi> which having only produc'd Å¿mall <hi>Shoots</hi> in the firÅ¿t Year, has been preÅ¿erv'd, the <hi>Stem</hi> of it being only Å¿horten'd; if that <hi>Tree,</hi> I Å¿ay, does not, at the very Entrance of the Spring, begin to Å¿hoot fine new <hi>Branches,</hi> I am alÅ¿o of Opinion that it Å¿hou'd, without any heÅ¿itation, be us'd in the Å¿ame manner with the fore-going, we have now been Å¿peaking of: It wou'd be a kind of Miracle, if ever it Å¿hou'd come to a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affording any Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>But if, as it happens pretty often in the CaÅ¿e of <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> and Å¿ometimes, but not Å¿o often, in the CaÅ¿e of <hi>Stone-Fruit;</hi> if, I Å¿ay, that <hi>Tree,</hi> thus taken down lower, has Å¿hot fine <hi>Branches</hi> at its new Extremity, as well as that, which, having Å¿hot but one at the top of the <hi>Stem,</hi> has been likewiÅ¿e taken down lower than the place of that <hi>Branch;</hi> then both the one, and the other will fall in one of the CaÅ¿es heretofore explain'd for the firÅ¿t <hi>Shooting</hi> of thoÅ¿e <hi>new-planted Trees</hi> which have happily Å¿ucceeded; and Å¿o we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular to add to the Conduct that is to be obÅ¿erv'd for them.</p>
                        <p>Let us now proceed to the <hi>Tree,</hi> which had only produc'd one fine <hi>Branch,</hi> be it either about the middle of the <hi>Stem,</hi> or at the bottom; Å¿uppoÅ¿ing always, as we have Å¿aid, that even in that firÅ¿t Year Care Å¿hall have been taken, in both CaÅ¿es, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both theÅ¿e only <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿treight, if they were not Å¿o naturally: For, if that Care has not been taken, the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> muÅ¿t have been oblig'd, as I have Å¿aid heretofore, not only to lower the <hi>Stem</hi> to thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> but likewiÅ¿e to Å¿horten them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaÅ¿s of two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> of the place whence they grew; which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we muÅ¿t in this CaÅ¿e only conÅ¿ider for the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> that which Å¿hall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd upon the <hi>Branches</hi> which are to Å¿hoot from thoÅ¿e two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> of a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿o extraordinarily Å¿horten'd: And thus this firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> will fall in one of the CaÅ¿es of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the firÅ¿t <hi>Branches</hi> of a new-planted <hi>Tree,</hi> without any neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿aying any thing more upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firÅ¿t Year had only produc'd one <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> having been <hi>Prun'd</hi> upon that <hi>Branch,</hi> never fails, as we have already Å¿aid, of producing others on the Extremity of that <hi>Branch;</hi> and, for Example, will, without doubt, have Å¿hot upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48210:146"/>
it, at leaÅ¿t, one thick one, with Å¿ome weak ones, and perhaps two or three thick ones, which is pretty uÅ¿ual, and may be more. This great Multitude does not happen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; but yet it happens Å¿ometimes.</p>
                        <p>If unfortunately it had only produc'd one upon it, partly of the Å¿ame thickneÅ¿s with the Mother, which may happen by Å¿ome accident befaln to the firÅ¿t <hi>Roots,</hi> then you muÅ¿t be PoÅ¿itive either in re-cutting the New one very Å¿hort, leaving it only two <hi>Eyes,</hi> or in cutting it quite off, which is yet better; in hopes that the other, which we muÅ¿t call the Old one, may <hi>Shoot</hi> forth Å¿omething more conÅ¿iderable the following year, as it may happen: For the <hi>Tree</hi> may chance to have made better <hi>Roots</hi> the third year, than it had produc'd either the firÅ¿t, or Å¿econd; and conÅ¿equently, being grown more Vigorous, it may Å¿hoot a greater quantity of Fine <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But yet, to Å¿peak the Truth in Å¿uch CaÅ¿es, there is no relying upon the SucceÅ¿s of Å¿uch a <hi>Tree,</hi> which Å¿hews Å¿o little Vigour in the beginning; and therefore it is my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and I think it very material, to have recourÅ¿e to the Magazine of <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>BaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,</hi> not to languiÅ¿h in vain hopes, at leaÅ¿t beyond the Å¿econd year, otherwiÅ¿e you may chance to languiÅ¿h yet longer, and always to no purpoÅ¿e, as it happens to a great many of the Curious.</p>
                        <p>And if that Å¿ingle <hi>Branch,</hi> being well <hi>Prun'd,</hi> has perform'd its duty Å¿o well, as to have produc'd at leaÅ¿t two of thoÅ¿e fine ones, which we look upon as <hi>Wood-Branches,</hi> or perhaps three or four, beÅ¿ides Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e that are fit for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all theÅ¿e CaÅ¿es, nothing can be done beÅ¿ides what has been Å¿aid for the <hi>Trees,</hi> which in the firÅ¿t year of their being <hi>Planted</hi> have produc'd the Å¿ame quantity of <hi>Shoots,</hi> that is, Å¿ome <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> may be preÅ¿erv'd; but among the thick ones, only Å¿uch as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce towards the Beauty of the Figure, cutting off all the others without any mercy, either cloÅ¿e, or within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown-piece.</p>
                        <p>So the Å¿econd <hi>Pruning</hi> of Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t be perform'd upon the fine <hi>Branches</hi> that are Å¿hot from that Å¿ingle <hi>Branch,</hi> and muÅ¿t differ in nothing from the firÅ¿t that is to be perform'd upon the fine <hi>Branches,</hi> which the firÅ¿t year have been happily produc'd from the <hi>Stem</hi> of a new <hi>Planted Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Precaution of keeping upright the Å¿ingle <hi>Branch</hi> grown upon a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> would be good, but is not Å¿o abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary as upon a <hi>Dwarf-Standard;</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of the Convenience of turning almoÅ¿t at pleaÅ¿ure the <hi>Branches</hi> that Å¿hall proceed from that, after having <hi>Prun'd</hi> it: The only thing then, is to take care in their youth of faÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to the Right and Left, according as may be neceÅ¿Å¿ary for laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Beautiful Figure; and in Å¿o doing, it is eaÅ¿ie to remedy certain defects which can hardly be remedy'd in a low <hi>Standard.</hi>

                           <p>Of the Å¿econd <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> that has Produc'd two Fine <hi>Branches</hi> in the FirÅ¿t Year of its being <hi>Planted.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS to our <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firÅ¿t Year has produc'd two Fine Well-plac'd <hi>Branches,</hi> we muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e, and it is generally very certain, that both the one and the other having been <hi>Prun'd</hi> within the compaÅ¿s of four, five, or Å¿ix Inches, or thereabouts, with all the Caution heretofore obÅ¿erv'd, both as to their thickneÅ¿s and Original, as well as the Å¿ituation of the laÅ¿t <hi>Eyes</hi> that have been left at their Extremities; I Å¿ay, it muÅ¿t be Å¿uppos'd, that both theÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hall each of them have produc'd at their Extremities, at leaÅ¿t two fine Å¿trong ones, both well plac'd, beÅ¿ides Å¿ome Å¿mall ones that Å¿hall be grown either beneath, or above them.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e two fine <hi>Branches,</hi> newly grown, fill up the two Å¿ides agreeably, which (to advance the perfection of the round Figure) Å¿tood in need of that help.</p>
                        <p>And if one of theÅ¿e two firÅ¿t, or even both had produc'd each of them above two, either according to the order of Nature, or againÅ¿t it; we muÅ¿t without doubt reÅ¿olve to cut off cloÅ¿e thoÅ¿e among theÅ¿e new-commers, which, in what Situation Å¿oever, are not favourably enough plac'd to conduce to our DeÅ¿ign; and therefore if they prove higher than thoÅ¿e which we preÅ¿erve, in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, if the <hi>Tree</hi> be but moderately Vigorous, you muÅ¿t take it down to theÅ¿e, to Å¿trengthen it the more: But if it be very Vigorous, thoÅ¿e higheÅ¿t may be cut Å¿quare, within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown-Piece, from the place where they iÅ¿Å¿ue; and likewiÅ¿e if thoÅ¿e unhappy <hi>Branches</hi> prove lower than thoÅ¿e
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48210:147"/>
that are preÅ¿erv'd, and in a Å¿ituation inclining on the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Tree,</hi> they muÅ¿t like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e be taken away, but no otherwiÅ¿e than in the manner I have juÅ¿t expreÅ¿s'd, which I call <hi>Pruning</hi> within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown Piece, as it appears by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Pruning</hi> perform'd within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown, often Å¿erves to give us the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year a Å¿mall <hi>Branch</hi> or two, which proceed from the Å¿ides of that thickneÅ¿s, and are commonly very good for <hi>Fruit;</hi> it happens likewiÅ¿e then, that as the <hi>Sap</hi> finds it Å¿elf Å¿topt thus at the Overture of the <hi>Branch</hi> in queÅ¿tion, and as it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity move forwards, it not being able to return back, being puÅ¿h'd and preÅ¿s'd by Å¿ome other that follows it cloÅ¿e, to make it go out at the top; I Å¿ay it happens then, that this firÅ¿t <hi>Sap</hi> enters Å¿ometimes, or the greateÅ¿t part of it, into the Å¿uperiour <hi>Branch,</hi> which is neareÅ¿t to that thickneÅ¿s, and which, however, had already a Portion Å¿uitable to its thickneÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>If it cannot enter altogether in it, as it happens pretty often, the remainder of it is divided, and burÅ¿ts out, as we have Å¿aid, upon the Å¿ides of that Å¿mall thickneÅ¿s, and furniÅ¿hes us with Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e good little <hi>Branches</hi> which vve deÅ¿ire, as it appears by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes vve may alÅ¿o take avvay thoÅ¿e vvretched <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿lopingly, that is, cut them in Å¿uch a manner, that on the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Tree</hi> there may not remain the leaÅ¿t part, and on the outÅ¿ide enough for Å¿ome Nevv <hi>Branches</hi> to Å¿hoot out of it, as it appears like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviÅ¿e by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>This Å¿loping way of <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be practis'd when the <hi>Branches,</hi> being neither altogether outward, nor yet wholly inward, they are a little upon the Å¿ide, on which part however they cannot be preÅ¿erv'd; but yet are plac'd Å¿o, that by that Å¿lope one may expect the following year a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hooting wholly outwards.</p>
                        <p>Now Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> may chance to be thick, and conÅ¿equently capable of conducing to the Figure, or weak, and Å¿o fit to give <hi>Fruit;</hi> and in caÅ¿e, as it happens Å¿ometimes, nothing proceeds from that Å¿lope, the Figure of our <hi>Tree</hi> will be no wiÅ¿e alter'd by it.</p>
                        <p>I dare be bold to Å¿ay, that this <hi>Pruning</hi> in a Å¿loping manner, which is a New Invention, is an Excellent way of <hi>Pruning</hi> to be practis'd upon all Å¿orts of <hi>Trees</hi> that have a little Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, whether Old or Young, when Å¿ome <hi>Branches,</hi> unhappily plac'd, as we have juÅ¿t explain'd it, give us cauÅ¿e to do it with hopes of Å¿ucceÅ¿s: It is not indeed Infallible, but it Å¿ucceeds very often, and for certain never Å¿poils any thing: Therefore I adviÅ¿e others to uÅ¿e it as I do; I generally find a great deal of benefit by it, and am very well pleas'd with my Å¿elf for having invented it.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may not be improper to relate here what made me think upon it; I knew, as every body does, and as we have juÅ¿t obÅ¿erv'd it upon the account of the <hi>Pruning,</hi> which is perform'd within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown Piece; I Å¿ay I knew, that according to the Order of Nature, the <hi>Sap</hi> newly form'd in the Spring, regularly preÅ¿ented it Å¿elf at the entrance of all the Channels of the <hi>Branches</hi> form'd the preceeding year, to NouriÅ¿h, Thicken, and Lengthen them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Å¿o I knew that it was certainly to return to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perform its function in the <hi>Branch</hi> I took away, it being ignorant, as I may Å¿ay, of its being taken away; therefore I concluded from thence, that apparently part of the <hi>Sap</hi> would make its way at the Place where it found it Å¿elf dam'd up, provided it found room enough to get out: So that, in leaving Å¿uch a Place on the outÅ¿ide, a <hi>Branch</hi> would Å¿hoot from it to do me a kindneÅ¿s. SucceÅ¿s has confirm'd my ReaÅ¿oning, and Practice; and Å¿o from a <hi>Branch</hi> that was grown in an ill and troubleÅ¿om Å¿ituation, I put my Å¿elf in a way of drawing a conÅ¿iderable advantage for my <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it Å¿hould happen as, Å¿ometimes it does, that one of thoÅ¿e two firÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> we Å¿peak of in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> Å¿hould have produc'd from its <hi>Extremity</hi> but one thick enough, with Å¿ome Å¿mall ones lower, whilÅ¿t her Neighbour has produc'd the two we expected; or this having really produc'd two, of which, one might be broken, or Å¿poil'd by Å¿ome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Å¿o that only one remain'd on that Å¿ide: TheÅ¿e are two CaÅ¿es in which I think it very material to Explain what is to be done.</p>
                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t, which is the growing but of one <hi>Branch</hi> inÅ¿tead of two, which in Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were to have grown; in that firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing there may be cauÅ¿e to judge, that the <hi>Prun'd Branch</hi> has not receiv'd Å¿o large a proportion of <hi>Sap</hi> as her Companion, which will appear in that, for Example, it Å¿hall not have thicken'd in proportion to the other, which proceeds from Å¿ome inward, un-fore-Å¿een, and inevitable defect; in that firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, this New <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be cut a little Å¿horter, and that with a ProÅ¿pect that apparently it will yield but one, which conÅ¿equently muÅ¿t be expected on that Å¿ide where it is moÅ¿t wanted for the Figure; with this ReÅ¿olve, that, if the following year the Original <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hews no more Vigour than the fore-going year, neither it, nor its Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pring

                        <p>In the Å¿econd CaÅ¿e, wherein one of the two New <hi>Branches</hi> which are grown from a Vigorous one, may have been torn off, or broken; in that Å¿econd CaÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, whether the remaining <hi>Branch</hi> prove that which was grown on the Extremity, or that which was grown from the Å¿econd <hi>Eye,</hi> we may apparently reckon that the <hi>Sap</hi> which made the two, and would have nouriÅ¿h'd them both, had they remain'd, will come altogether into the remaining; and that Å¿o it muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd,</hi> in hopes that it will at leaÅ¿t produce two, which will be well plac'd, according to our wiÅ¿h, if, in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of it, we obÅ¿erve all that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be done; but above all, we muÅ¿t always take care not to let one Å¿ide of the <hi>Tree</hi> grow higher than the other, for fear of the Deformity which attends that Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, which muÅ¿t be avoided as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible: And therefore in <hi>Pruning</hi> Å¿uch a Vigorous <hi>Branch,</hi> which is left alone by Å¿ome accident befaln to her SiÅ¿ter, we muÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the length of the new <hi>Pruning</hi> we perform upon it, to that we make upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ite <hi>Branch,</hi> which has not profited proportionably to what it had done the firÅ¿t year; and that in fine, until the whole Figure of Å¿uch a <hi>Teee</hi> comes to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h it Å¿elf entirely upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> which Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively muÅ¿t come from the vigorous Å¿ide, a Skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is Å¿ufficiently the MaÅ¿ter of Å¿uch an Operation.</p>
                        <p>If from the laÅ¿t <hi>Eye</hi> of one of the two firÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> from which <hi>Eye,</hi> according to the Order of Nature, a thick one Å¿hould have proceeded; if Å¿uch a one, I Å¿ay, Å¿hould bring forth a weak <hi>Branch,</hi> or even if the two laÅ¿t <hi>Eyes</hi> have produc'd two weak ones, which, as we have Å¿aid, regularly Å¿hould have given us two thick ones, and under theÅ¿e weak ones Å¿hould have grown one or two thick ones, or more, which happens Å¿ometimes; in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, this, or theÅ¿e weak ones, muÅ¿t infallibly be look'd upon as <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> their weakneÅ¿s procuring them that Merit in regard to us; and Å¿o we Å¿hall preÅ¿erve them very preciouÅ¿ly, breaking them as little as can be on their <hi>Extremities,</hi> in caÅ¿e they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too weak for their length, or leaving them untouch'd, if they Å¿eem well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd of themÅ¿elves: And this without doubt is one of the moÅ¿t material Advices I could give.</p>
                        <p>Woe to thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> which Å¿hall paÅ¿s through the hands of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> who will not be able to make uÅ¿e of this Advice, or Å¿hall take away thoÅ¿e weak <hi>Branches'</hi> as cauÅ¿ing any deformity to the wretched Idea they have form'd to themÅ¿elves of a <hi>Tree,</hi> if they have really fram'd any, for the greateÅ¿t part of them Å¿eldom frame any; and cut pell-mell, whatever Å¿ort of <hi>Branches</hi> fall under their Hands: ThoÅ¿e Wretches, in the firÅ¿t place, do not obÅ¿erve or mind that Fine <hi>Fruit</hi> never Å¿poils any thing, what ever place it be in: In the Å¿econd, that it is a kind of Murther to take away a fine diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to <hi>Fruit</hi> when it is already form'd, although an ignorant Man does not know it; and that laÅ¿tly, the Beauty of the Figure of a <hi>Tree</hi> only conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, and depends abÅ¿olutely upon the thick <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time, it is to be obÅ¿erv'd, that the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> that are thus grown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoÅ¿e weak ones, which are found on the <hi>Extremity;</hi> that thoÅ¿e thick <hi>Branches</hi> I Å¿ay, Å¿hall commonly in that place have begun to follow the Order of Nature for the difference of their ThickneÅ¿s, and Length, in the Å¿ame manner as if they had grown on that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,</hi> where Naturally they ought to be.</p>
                        <p>In that CaÅ¿e they muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> juÅ¿t as if they were really grown from that <hi>Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> that is, one or two of them muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing they may contribute to the Figure; which being granted, they muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> of a reaÅ¿onable length, according to their Strength, and the Vigour of the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> Å¿till preÅ¿erving the neceÅ¿Å¿ary regard that muÅ¿t be had for the <hi>Branches</hi> they are to <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> from the laÅ¿t <hi>Eyes</hi> of their new <hi>Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> and as for thoÅ¿e that might be prejudicial to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree;</hi> if there are really any Å¿uch, they muÅ¿t be taken away in the manner here above Explain'd; that is, within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown Piece, or elÅ¿e Å¿lopingly, according to what may be beÅ¿t for the advantage of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I may begin to give notice here, that it happens Å¿ometimes, and even pretty often, that this <hi>Branch</hi> which was left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> which in the order of Nature Å¿hould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain weak, may, notwithÅ¿tanding, chance to thicken in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and perhaps produce one, or many thick ones on its <hi>Extremity,</hi> while that thoÅ¿e thick ones which had been <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿hort for <hi>Wood,</hi> remain almoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame Condition, and only produce weak ones, the <hi>Sap</hi> having, as I may Å¿ay, alter'd its CourÅ¿e, juÅ¿t as it happens Å¿ometimes in Å¿ome Rivers.</p>
                        <p>In Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, we muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit to that alteration, which cannot be prevented, nor hardly alter'd when once form'd; therefore we muÅ¿t begin the very next year after that alteration, to uÅ¿e that <hi>Branch</hi> like a <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> which having alter'd its property, is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48210:148"/>
become a <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> from being a <hi>Fruit-Branch;</hi> and Å¿o likewiÅ¿e alter our Method in reÅ¿pect to that which, from being a <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> is become a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is nothing to be fear'd Å¿o much, as to Å¿ee a <hi>Tree</hi> grow thin towards the bottom, which part ought to be fulleÅ¿t; which is the reaÅ¿on that I am Å¿o very Å¿ollicitous, that no <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> Å¿hould ever be left long in the <hi>Pruning,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be perhaps on Å¿ome here and there, as we have Å¿aid, to let them take up, for a Year or two, part of that <hi>Sap</hi> which might prove troubleÅ¿om to us, and afterwards remove them when the <hi>Tree</hi> bears <hi>Fruit;</hi> that is, it muÅ¿t be done Å¿ometimes, when they are extraordinary vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> but as it is never done without good Grounds, Å¿o it ever proves advantageous.</p>
                        <p>This Way of <hi>Pruning</hi> thick <hi>Branches</hi> long, is a Fault moÅ¿t <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are guilty of, and that for want of knowing, or taking notice, that as the greateÅ¿t part of our <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> are not capable of furniÅ¿hing at one and the Å¿ame time a great Extent, that is, to fill at once both the Top and Bottom; and that naturally, contrary to our Intention, and the Beauty we affect, they all incline to grow upwards, and conÅ¿equently, that Bottom which Å¿hou'd be fulleÅ¿t, remains moÅ¿t bare, unleÅ¿s we uÅ¿e a particular Application to oppoÅ¿e in this the CourÅ¿e of Nature, which Å¿eeks, it Å¿eems, to deceive us: Therefore a great deal of Care muÅ¿t be taken to Å¿top, that is, to <hi>prune</hi> thoÅ¿e thick <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hort enough, it being moÅ¿t certain that they never Å¿hoot much in the lower part, from whence they proceed; but only on their Extremity, whatever it be, high or low.</p>
                        <p>The Defect of ThinneÅ¿s, which is Å¿ufficiently minded in <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> is yet much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervable in <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> where, among unskilful <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> we Å¿eldom Å¿ee any thing but the top of the Wall well cover'd, and that even <hi>Garland-</hi>wiÅ¿e, Å¿o that commonly all the new <hi>Branches</hi> exceed the top of it, and there Å¿pend the Vigour of the <hi>Tree</hi> to no purpoÅ¿e; which obliges them to cut thoÅ¿e wretched <hi>Branches</hi> four or five times in a Summer, to prevent the DiÅ¿orders of the Wind; while the Heart of the <hi>Tree</hi> is only compos'd of long, blackiÅ¿h, moÅ¿Å¿y, wrinckled <hi>Branches,</hi> deÅ¿titute of thoÅ¿e other little ones that Å¿hou'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them; and even often full of Scars, and conÅ¿equently, the Wall, which Å¿hou'd be cover'd every where, always beginning from the bottom, on the contrary, appears quite bare, and the <hi>Tree</hi> has none of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> it ought to have.</p>
                        <p>Granting then, that a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> muÅ¿t Å¿eldom, or never be left long at the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be in order to form a <hi>Tree,</hi> or to fill up Å¿ome parts of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theÅ¿t Å¿ides, it is yet leÅ¿s allowable the following Years, upon the thick new <hi>Branch,</hi> which is grown from that which having been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> is afterwards grown thick, by an unexpected and extraordinary abundance of <hi>Sap.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is another dangerous Rock, from which few Å¿ave themÅ¿elves: Therefore I am of Opinion, that, inÅ¿tead of performing our <hi>Pruning</hi> upon a thick and long <hi>Branch,</hi> Å¿hot from one that had been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> we Å¿hou'd deÅ¿cend, or come down to that old one, and Å¿horten it, leaving it no more length than it might have been allow'd, had it been at firÅ¿t of the thickneÅ¿s it is grown Å¿ince.</p>
                        <p>And if Å¿uch an old <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hou'd not prove of an exceÅ¿Å¿ive length, it will be Å¿ufficient to <hi>prune</hi> all the new ones that are grown from it Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that not the leaÅ¿t part of them may remain, whence any thing new might proceed.</p>
                        <p>In theÅ¿e two CaÅ¿es it is moÅ¿t certain, that Å¿uch an old <hi>Branch,</hi> Å¿o order'd, will not fail, at the very following Spring, to produce others on its Extremity; Å¿ome for <hi>Fruit,</hi> and others for <hi>Wood;</hi> among which, thoÅ¿e muÅ¿t be choÅ¿en that are fitteÅ¿t for the Figure, to the end that, according to the Maxims heretofore eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, they may be <hi>prun'd</hi> like thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and continu'd to be order'd as Å¿uch, while Nature cauÅ¿es no alteration in them.</p>

                        <p>TO <hi>Prune</hi> for the Å¿econd time a <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firÅ¿t Year had produc'd four fine <hi>Branches,</hi> and even more, it is certain, that as this <hi>Tree</hi> has a great deal more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour than all the others we have mention'd, Å¿o it requires more Application and Skill, not to let it fall into thoÅ¿e Inconveniences wherewith it is threaten'd.</p>
                        <p>I muÅ¿t Å¿ay here, that in Å¿uch a <hi>Tree,</hi> eÅ¿pecially in a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿ometimes to preÅ¿erve Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> upon it, which at that time are no ways conducing to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> but Å¿erve to conÅ¿ume for a time part of the <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>As to thoÅ¿e that are eÅ¿Å¿ential for the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> I have begun to <hi>prune</hi> them all a little longer than thoÅ¿e of the preceding <hi>Trees;</hi> that is, about two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> at moÅ¿t; as well to avoid ConfuÅ¿ion, which is a very perniclous thing, and to be avoided at any rate, as to make an advantage of the Vigour of Å¿uch a <hi>Tree;</hi> which, without Å¿uch a precaution, wou'd not yield <hi>Fruit</hi> of a long time, becauÅ¿e the great abundance of <hi>Sap</hi> might convert into <hi>Branches</hi> all the <hi>Eyes</hi> that Å¿hou'd have turn'd into <hi>Flower-Buds,</hi> had their NouriÅ¿hment been more moderate.</p>
                        <p>Such a <hi>Tree,</hi> at the End of the Å¿econd Year, appears in a manner quite form'd, by means of all the new <hi>Branches</hi> that every one of the old ones that have been <hi>prun'd</hi> Å¿hall have produc'd on their Extremities; and, among the new ones, Care muÅ¿t be taken to chuÅ¿e thoÅ¿e that conduce to the Beauty of the Figure, to <hi>prune</hi> them again, partly of the Å¿ame length as thoÅ¿e had been <hi>prun'd</hi> for the firÅ¿t Time, from which they proceed; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, above all, to judge whether the <hi>Branch</hi> that has been <hi>prun'd</hi> may, at leaÅ¿t, produce two, in order to preÅ¿erve them both, if they prove fit to contribute to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign: Or in caÅ¿e one muÅ¿t be quite taken away, let it commonly be the higheÅ¿t, to the end, that, as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible can be, the loweÅ¿t may always be preÅ¿erv'd, as the fitteÅ¿t to form or preÅ¿erve the Beauty we look for; and by that means, not only the place which is cut Å¿hall be (to uÅ¿e the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Term) quickly cover'd again, which is much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ir'd, as an Ornament in a <hi>Tree;</hi> but beÅ¿ides, it will make no Wound upon the <hi>Branches</hi> that Å¿hall be preÅ¿erv'd; and conÅ¿equently, the <hi>Tree</hi> will thereby be infallibly handÅ¿omer and Å¿ounder.</p>
                        <p>But if the Vigour of that <hi>Tree</hi> be obÅ¿erv'd to continue, as it is very common, and even to augment viÅ¿ibly, in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e ConfuÅ¿ion is to be fear'd more than ever, either in the Heart of our <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or in reÅ¿pect to our <hi>Wall-Fruit-Tree,</hi> whatever <hi>Trees</hi> they be, of either kind, <hi>Pear-Trees, Apple-Trees, Plum-Trees, Peach-Trees, Cherry-Trees, Fig-Trees, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore that Å¿econd <hi>Pruning</hi> muÅ¿t be perform'd yet a little longer than the firÅ¿t, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly if the <hi>Tree</hi> appears inclinable to cloÅ¿e; and that length muÅ¿t be about a large Foot, or a little more, to employ that abundance of <hi>Sap,</hi> which, we judge, muÅ¿t not be reÅ¿train'd, nor contain'd in a Å¿mall Å¿pace.</p>

Upon condition, that when, from the Å¿econd <hi>Pruning,</hi> other good <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hall be grown, which Å¿hall begin to open the <hi>Dwarf</hi> reaÅ¿onably, or to fill Å¿ufficiently our <hi>Wall-Fruit-Tree,</hi> eÅ¿pecially the <hi>Tree</hi> beginning to yield <hi>Fruit;</hi> upon condition, I Å¿ay, that then we Å¿hall return to our ordinary <hi>Pruning</hi> of Å¿ix or Å¿even Inches upon the moÅ¿t vigorous <hi>Branches,</hi> and four or five upon the moderate ones.</p>
                        <p>This great Fury Å¿eldom fails of diminiÅ¿hing at the End of the firÅ¿t five or Å¿ix Years, if the <hi>Tree</hi> has been well govern'd; and then all thoÅ¿e little <hi>Branches</hi> which we have taken care to procure in a great number at the bottom, and have afterwards preÅ¿erv'd with Care, begin to give us an ample Recompence for all our Cares: And even pretty often, in Å¿uch OccaÅ¿ions, we come to <hi>prune</hi> over again here and there Å¿ome of the old <hi>Branches,</hi> which the great Vigour of the <hi>Tree</hi> had oblig'd us to leave of an extraordinary length; and at the Å¿ame time we aim Å¿till at extending, by way of Overture, on the Å¿ides, there to employ uÅ¿efully the Vigour of that <hi>Tree,</hi> and indiÅ¿penceably to preÅ¿erve its agreeable Figure.</p>
                        <p>It is upon thoÅ¿e very vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> that we muÅ¿t begin to perform Å¿ome MaÅ¿terly Strokes: We muÅ¿t, as is done in point of <hi>Fountains,</hi> make here and there a kind of <hi>Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> or rather, a kind of Superficial DiÅ¿charge; that is, for Example, leave upon that <hi>Tree,</hi> without any uÅ¿e, Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> cut <hi>Stump-wiÅ¿e,</hi> and even Å¿ome thick ones, though of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> in which, for Å¿ome Years Å¿pace, that furious <hi>Sap,</hi> of which we have too much, may loÅ¿e it Å¿elf in vain, which otherwiÅ¿e might diÅ¿order Å¿ome of our principal Parts: And even, if upon thoÅ¿e Å¿ort of <hi>Trees</hi> any <hi>Branches</hi> of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood</hi> be found in a place where they may Å¿erve towards the Figure of the <hi>Tree,</hi> they muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd, and us'd as Å¿uch; being certain that, as they will take up the greateÅ¿t abundance of the <hi>Sap,</hi> the good <hi>Branches,</hi> which have produc'd thoÅ¿e falÅ¿e ones, will receive leÅ¿s, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the Å¿ooner; theÅ¿e falÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> in the mean time performing the Å¿ame Effect, as to the Figure, as good ones cou'd have done.</p>
                        <p>Such <hi>Branches</hi> may likewiÅ¿e be left, where-ever the Overture of the <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hall not be prejudic'd by them; from whence, the <hi>Tree</hi> bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> they may at pleaÅ¿ure be taken away without any prejudice to the Figure; provided always they cauÅ¿e not the leaÅ¿t Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, that being the greateÅ¿t harm that can happen to a vigorous <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas, to moderate the great Fury of Å¿uch a <hi>Tree,</hi> in reÅ¿pect to our Å¿elves, that is, to make it bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the Å¿ooner, two things are particularly required, beÅ¿ides the Overture; which are, firÅ¿t, the length and multitude of good weak <hi>Branches,</hi> when they are plac'd Å¿o as to cauÅ¿e no ConfuÅ¿ion; and in the Å¿econd place, a conÅ¿iderable Plurality of Out-lets upon the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> through which that abundance of <hi>Sap</hi> may perform its Effect, Å¿ince we cou'd not hinder it from doing it in Å¿ome part of the <hi>Tree.</hi>

                        <p>Therefore, when the Figure of my Tree will permit it, if Å¿ome <hi>Branch, prun'd</hi> the preceding Year, has produc'd three or four, all pretty thick ones, I often do not retrench them; Å¿o that having one or two of the beÅ¿t plac'd, I preÅ¿erve one or two of the others for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the next Year, and leave them reaÅ¿onably long. BeÅ¿ides this, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve the loweÅ¿t, I cut the higheÅ¿t <hi>Stump-wiÅ¿e;</hi> and when I preÅ¿erve the higheÅ¿t, I leave under them, either on the out-Å¿ide, or upon the Å¿ides, one or two <hi>Stumps</hi> of the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> form'd like the <hi>Hooks</hi> of a <hi>Vine,</hi> each about two Inches in length, as it appears by the Figure annex'd hereunto; which Å¿ucceeds very well to me.</p>
                        <p>There infallibly happens in thoÅ¿e <hi>Stumps,</hi> or <hi>Hooks,</hi> a DiÅ¿charge of <hi>Sap,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Å¿ome favourable <hi>Branches,</hi> either for <hi>Fruit</hi> when they prove weak, or to become in time fit <hi>Branches</hi> for the Figure when they are Å¿trong.</p>
                        <p>The beÅ¿t way always is to lower the <hi>Tree,</hi> in taking away the higheÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> to preÅ¿erve the loweÅ¿t; and not take away the loweÅ¿t, to preÅ¿erve the higheÅ¿t; to the end, that if the <hi>Tree</hi> cannot fill both at top and bottom, it may rather be diÅ¿pos'd to remain low, and well fill'd, than to riÅ¿e high, without being well fill'd.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e kind of <hi>Stumps</hi> and <hi>Hooks</hi> will not pleaÅ¿e our <hi>Gard'ners</hi> at firÅ¿t, who neither know my Principles, nor the way of <hi>Cupping;</hi> which we have explain'd here above: But if, after having known my ReaÅ¿ons, and long Experience, they will neither approve, or try them, Å¿o much the worÅ¿e for them; they muÅ¿t give me leave to pity their Ignorance, or ObÅ¿tinacy.</p>

                           <p>Of the <hi>Pruning</hi> that muÅ¿t be perform'd the Third Year, upon all Å¿orts of <hi>Trees planted</hi> within Four Years.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THis CaÅ¿e does not require the preceding DiÅ¿tinctions we have made, to determine what was to be done to <hi>Trees,</hi> according to the Å¿maller or greater quantity of <hi>Branches</hi> they had produc'd the firÅ¿t Year: They muÅ¿t, at the end of four Years, be partly all of the Å¿ame ClaÅ¿Å¿is, though they be not all furniÅ¿h'd with an equal quantity of thick <hi>Branches:</hi> But however, both the one and the other muÅ¿t have produc'd a Å¿ufficient number, to Å¿hew a <hi>Head</hi> entirely form'd; and though even that, for Example, which had produc'd but one the firÅ¿t Year, Å¿hou'd have produc'd but four or five in the fourth, Å¿till there Å¿hou'd be nothing to be Å¿aid in reÅ¿pect to that, Å¿ince that, if it be vigorous, it will partly fall under the CaÅ¿e of a <hi>Tree</hi> which at firÅ¿t had produc'd four or five, or more; and if it be not of thoÅ¿e that are capable of producing more than one thick <hi>Branch</hi> on the Extremity of the <hi>Pruning,</hi> you muÅ¿t regulate your Å¿elf upon the meanneÅ¿s of its Vigour, both in keeping the thickeÅ¿t <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hort, and expecting but one thick one on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of each, making it ever grow on that part where the Figure requires it moÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t always inviolably follow the <hi>Idea</hi> of a fine <hi>Tree</hi> we have firÅ¿t of all propos'd to our Å¿elves, either in a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> and never fail to proportion the Burthen of the Head to the Vigour of the Foot, in leaving more and longer <hi>Branches</hi> on a vigorous <hi>Tree,</hi> and leÅ¿s and Å¿horter on that which appears weak.</p>
                        <p>And whereas many old <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be carefully preÅ¿erv'd on a vigorous <hi>Tree,</hi> eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for <hi>Fruit,</hi> provided there be no ConfuÅ¿ion; on the contrary, you muÅ¿t eaÅ¿e a weak <hi>Tree</hi> of the Burthen of the old <hi>Branches,</hi> as well thoÅ¿e that are for <hi>Wood,</hi> as thoÅ¿e that are for <hi>Fruit;</hi> and out them Å¿hort, in order to make it Å¿hoot new ones, if it can, with reÅ¿olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pull it out of the <hi>Ground,</hi> if not able to perform it; which being done, a better muÅ¿t be plac'd in its room, after having taken away all the old <hi>Earth,</hi> which may be judg'd to be either ill, or worn out, and having put new in the room of it.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿till forewarn, that, in <hi>Pruning,</hi> ProviÅ¿ion muÅ¿t be made for thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thoÅ¿e that are <hi>Pruning,</hi> in order to prepare Å¿ome that may be proper for the Figure, with this AÅ¿Å¿urance, that when a high <hi>Branch</hi> is taken down over a lower, this being Å¿trengthen'd by all the NouriÅ¿hment that wou'd have gone to the higheÅ¿t, which has been taken away; this low <hi>Branch,</hi> I Å¿ay, will produce more <hi>Branches</hi> than it Å¿hou'd have done, had it receiv'd no Re-inforcement.</p>
                        <p>In Å¿hort, when, according to my Principles, a young <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hall have been conducted to a fourth <hi>Pruning,</hi> the Effect will infallibly have made good what I have promis'd, both as to the beautiful Figure, which muÅ¿t then appear in its prime, and as to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which, <hi>Pears</hi> then begin to Å¿hew a Sample, and <hi>Stone-Fruit</hi> abundance: After this, apparently every body muÅ¿t be capable thenceforward to manage all manner of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> without needing any other InÅ¿tructions than the preceding; and indeed, I have no other new ones to give; and it wou'd be ridiculous and tireÅ¿om to repeat the Å¿ame things, which, in my Opinion, I have Å¿ufficiently eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd.</p>
                        <p>It Å¿eldom happens, that all the <hi>Trees</hi> of the Å¿ame <hi>Garden,</hi> though order'd alike, prove equally vigorous; no more than the Children of the Å¿ame Father, all equally healthy: <hi>Trees,</hi> as well as Men, are Å¿ubject to an infinite number of Accidents, that can neither be fore-Å¿een, nor avoided; but it is certain, that all the <hi>Trees</hi> of a <hi>Garden</hi> may be form'd agreeably in their Figure; and this is one of the principal things to which a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is oblig'd.</p>
                        <p>Above all, I adviÅ¿e every body not to be obÅ¿tinate in preÅ¿erving <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> which year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, towards the end of Summer, grow extream yellow, without having produc'd fine <hi>Shoots;</hi> nor thoÅ¿e, of which the Extremities of the <hi>Branches</hi> likewiÅ¿e die every Year. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Trees graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince;</hi> of which, Å¿ome of the principal <hi>Roots</hi> are dead, or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotten: They are <hi>Trees</hi> that produce but Å¿mall <hi>Roots</hi> at the upper part of the Foot, and conÅ¿equently, <hi>Roots</hi> that are expos'd to all the Injuries of the Air, and of the <hi>Spade.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Å¿ame thing may be Å¿aid of the <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> that appear the firÅ¿t Years to gather <hi>Gum</hi> at the greateÅ¿t part of their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and of thoÅ¿e that are extreamly attack'd with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little <hi>Fleas</hi> and <hi>PiÅ¿mires.</hi> Such <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> have certainly Å¿ome rotten <hi>Roots,</hi> and will never do well.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48210:151"/>
I am likewiÅ¿e of the Å¿ame Opinion for thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> that Å¿hoot on all Å¿ides an infinite number of little, weak, Å¿apleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> with Å¿ome thick ones here and there; both the one and the other, for the moÅ¿t part, of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood:</hi> In which caÅ¿e, a great deal of time may be loÅ¿t upon ill-grounded hopes.</p>
                        <p>That which is beÅ¿t to be done in all theÅ¿e OccaÅ¿ions, is, as Å¿oon as can be to remove Å¿uch <hi>Trees;</hi> and when they are not extreamly old, or Å¿poil'd by the <hi>Roots,</hi> venture to plant them again in Å¿ome other place, in good <hi>Ground,</hi> after having cleans'd them of all their <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneÅ¿s</hi> and <hi>Cankers,</hi> in order to Å¿ee if they will come to any thing, to make uÅ¿e of them elÅ¿ewhere; which happens Å¿ometimes with <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> but very Å¿eldom with <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> eÅ¿pecially <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> Å¿till putting better in the room of them, with all the Conditions heretofore explain'd.</p>

                           <p>Of the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> that have been <hi>Planted</hi> with many <hi>Branches.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFter having Å¿ufficiently explain'd, in the TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Plantations,</hi> my AverÅ¿ion to <hi>plant</hi> little <hi>Trees</hi> with many <hi>Branches,</hi> I am willing at preÅ¿ent to believe, that as I Å¿eldom <hi>plant</hi> any, thoÅ¿e who will do me the honour to imitate me, will do the Å¿ame. However, ThoÅ¿e that will <hi>plant</hi> Å¿uch, muÅ¿t principally obÅ¿erve two things: The firÅ¿t is, to cut off whatever may cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion, and is not proper to begin a fine Figure. The Å¿econd, to leave a Length of about Å¿ix or Å¿even Inches to every <hi>Branch</hi> they preÅ¿erve upon them: And as for the other <hi>Branches</hi> that Å¿hall proceed from theÅ¿e, they muÅ¿t regulate themÅ¿elves upon the Principles which we have Å¿ufficiently eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of other <hi>Trees:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is certain, that Å¿uch <hi>Trees, planted</hi> with <hi>Branches,</hi> are not commonly Å¿o eaÅ¿ily turn'd to receive a fine Figure, as thoÅ¿e I affect to <hi>plant:</hi> The old <hi>Branches</hi> that are left upon them, are not often happy in producing others on their Extremity, yet leÅ¿s to have them well-plac'd; they generally produce them diÅ¿orderly, and conÅ¿equently muÅ¿t be often wounded, before what is deÅ¿ir'd can be met with; but when at laÅ¿t attain'd, 'tis but following what has been Å¿aid diÅ¿tinctly enough for the management of a <hi>Tree,</hi> which having been <hi>planted</hi> without any <hi>Branches,</hi> has Å¿ince produc'd Å¿ome very fine ones, and very well plac'd.</p>
                        <p>And when <hi>Trees</hi> have been planted with a great many more and longer <hi>Branches</hi> than they Å¿hou'd have been, Å¿o that there appears no manner of diÅ¿poÅ¿ition towards the Figure we ought to wiÅ¿h for, Endeavours muÅ¿t be us'd immediately to reduce them upon a fine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that conformably to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Beauty Å¿o often explain'd.</p>
                        <p>What we Å¿hall Å¿ay hereafter, for the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of old <hi>Trees,</hi> that have never been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd well, may Å¿erve altogether for the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of theÅ¿e, without Å¿aying any thing more about it.</p>
                        <p>Though commonly, either as to low <hi>Standards,</hi> or <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> I condemn the manner of <hi>Planting</hi> little <hi>Trees</hi> with many <hi>Branches,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of the Inconveniences which attend them, in reÅ¿pect to the Figure they ought to have, I am not, however, Å¿o Å¿evere in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to high <hi>Standards,</hi> in which I do not condemn it Å¿o much, by reaÅ¿on that they do not require Å¿o great an ExactneÅ¿s for their Beauty: So that I allow they Å¿hou'd be <hi>planted</hi> Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> on their heads, when Å¿ome are found well enough diÅ¿pos'd for it; they will certainly produce <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿ooner than the others: But Å¿till I have a particular EÅ¿teem for thoÅ¿e that are <hi>planted</hi> without any.</p>
                        <p>There are Å¿ome other OccaÅ¿ions in which a <hi>Tree</hi> may be <hi>planted</hi> with many <hi>Branches;</hi> and that is, in a great <hi>Plantation,</hi> where Å¿ome other is dead; for Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the <hi>Ground</hi> to be very good, and other good <hi>Mould</hi> put into the Hole, made to <hi>plant</hi> the other, in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e a <hi>Tree</hi> may very well be planted with Å¿ome <hi>Branches,</hi> eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> that are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to <hi>fructifie.</hi> For Example, your <hi>Lady-Thigh, Pears</hi> without <hi>Rinds, Virgoulez, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>AS the Number of Principles for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> has been very great, Å¿o the number of Principles for <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>High-Standards</hi> Planted in open Wind, Å¿hall be very Å¿mall: For as to <hi>High-Å¿tandards</hi> Planted againÅ¿t a Wall, they all require the Å¿ame Precautions as the little ones; Å¿o that inÅ¿tead of medling yearly with thoÅ¿e Great <hi>Trees,</hi> I only deÅ¿ire, as I have Å¿aid in the beginning of this <hi>TreatiÅ¿e,</hi> that they Å¿hould be touch'd once or twice in the beginnings, that is, in the three or four firÅ¿t years, in order to remove Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> from the middle, which might cauÅ¿e a confuÅ¿ion there; or to Å¿horten a Å¿ide which riÅ¿es too much, or bring another nearer, which extends farther than in reaÅ¿on it ought to do: As for the remainder, we muÅ¿t refer it to Nature, and let her produce freely what Å¿he can, there would be too much pain and labour to order theÅ¿e with as much CircumÅ¿pection as the others.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>NOthing is Å¿o common in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> as to <hi>Graff</hi> in Slits upon Old <hi>Trees,</hi> be it either to be rid of Å¿ome ill <hi>Fruit</hi> we are weary of, or to improve Å¿ome conÅ¿iderable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty that has been diÅ¿cover'd; Å¿o that often we do not even Å¿pare good kinds, of Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> of which we have a Å¿ufficient Number.</p>
                        <p>Now as many things are to be Å¿aid upon thoÅ¿e Å¿ort of <hi>Graffs,</hi> and firÅ¿t, if the <hi>Tree</hi> has Å¿o little thickneÅ¿s as not to be able to receive above one, as none are commonly apply'd without having three <hi>Eyes;</hi> it may very well happen that every Å¿uch <hi>Graff</hi> Å¿hall produce three fine <hi>Branches</hi> fit to lay the foundation of a fine <hi>Tree;</hi> in which CaÅ¿e, we muÅ¿t have recourÅ¿e to what we have Å¿aid heretofore of the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firÅ¿t year had produc'd three fair <hi>Shoots;</hi> and may allow them about two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> more in length; if, as in all likelyhood it ought to happen, the <hi>Graff</hi> has produc'd very Vigorous <hi>Twigs,</hi> eÅ¿pecially if the <hi>Tree</hi> appears inclinable to cloÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd place, if the <hi>Tree</hi> to be <hi>Graffed</hi> is thick enough to receive two <hi>Graffs,</hi> as it is when it has a good Inch Diameter, or a little more; and if the two <hi>Graffs</hi> produce each two or three fine <hi>Branches,</hi> as it happens pretty often, then it is fit to Å¿tudy hard to avoid the great confuÅ¿ion that is threaten'd here by the great Proximity of <hi>Graffs,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently we muÅ¿t Å¿tudy to open; therefore among thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> thoÅ¿e that being thick and inwards, form that defect which we muÅ¿t never Å¿uffer, muÅ¿t be taken away, either within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown Piece, or Å¿lopingly, according as the Prudence of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and the occaÅ¿ion of the <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hall preÅ¿cribe: After which, not only the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> Å¿hall be perform'd a little longer than that of the <hi>Trees</hi> that have been <hi>Planted</hi> within a year or two, but a greater quantity of <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be kept upon them, as well quickly to finiÅ¿h the Figure, if the Matter be fit for it, as to imploy for a certain time the overplus of <hi>Sap</hi> we judge fit for our DeÅ¿igns, and that Plurality of <hi>Branches</hi> may comprehend thoÅ¿e <hi>Stumps</hi> and temporary <hi>Branches,</hi> as well as kind of <hi>Hooks</hi> that are on the outÅ¿ide, which I have Å¿poken of heretofore.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, the Å¿ame regards muÅ¿t be obÅ¿erv'd, and with more Å¿everity, as well for the Overture, as for the length of the firÅ¿t <hi>Prunings,</hi> if the <hi>Graffed Tree</hi> has been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving upon its head to the number of three or four <hi>Graffs,</hi> which happens when you <hi>Graff</hi> Crown-wiÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>So much the rather, if the <hi>Tree</hi> having Å¿everal thick <hi>Branches</hi> all pretty near the one to the other, and all capable of receiving Å¿everal <hi>Graffs</hi> on the Head, it comes to be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon every one of them. Such a <hi>Tree</hi> is apparently a little Old, and yet vigorous enough, Å¿o that all the <hi>Sap</hi> which was prepar'd by the great number of its <hi>Roots,</hi> and was Å¿ufficient for the NouriÅ¿hment and Maintenance of a great quantity of long and Å¿trong <hi>Branches,</hi> finding it Å¿elf pent up in the little compaÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e <hi>Graffs,</hi> produces generally there <hi>Branches</hi>

of an extraordinary thickneÅ¿s and length, to that degree, that pretty often one <hi>Eye</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces two or three <hi>Branches,</hi> moÅ¿t of them Å¿trong.</p>
                        <p>In Å¿uch CaÅ¿es, all the Prudence of a Skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is requir'd to make a good uÅ¿e of that great Vigour thus reduc'd, to the end that by means of a wiÅ¿e Conduct in a Å¿hort time a <hi>Tree</hi> may be brought to a fine Figure, and to bear a great deal: Nothing is more common than to Å¿ee Å¿uch <hi>Graffs</hi> ill order'd, and, if I may Å¿ay Å¿o, Cobbled and MaÅ¿Å¿acred; and ConÅ¿equently woe to that <hi>Tree,</hi> which for the firÅ¿t time falls under the hands of an ignorant <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>

                        <p>In the fourth place, the Å¿econd, third, and fourth years, and even longer, if it falls out Å¿o, you muÅ¿t labour in the manner aforeÅ¿aid, until the <hi>Tree</hi> begins to yield <hi>Fruit,</hi> and then you muÅ¿t not only return to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of Å¿ix or Å¿even Inches upon each <hi>Branch,</hi> but likewiÅ¿e take them lower from year to year, here and there, in order to have the lower part of your <hi>Tree</hi> always well fill'd, which you cannot arrive to by any other means.</p>
                        <p>What I have now Å¿aid in general upon Old <hi>Trees Graffed</hi> a-new in Place, may be indifferently apply'd as well to <hi>Dwarf-Å¿tandards</hi> as to <hi>Wall-Fruit-Trees;</hi> which being granted, we muÅ¿t ever propoÅ¿e to our Å¿elves the fine Ideas both of the one, and the other, which we have recommended at the beginning of this <hi>TreatiÅ¿e;</hi> knowing for certain, that confuÅ¿ion and thinneÅ¿s are of a dangerous ConÅ¿equence in point of <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> as well as <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> tho' we muÅ¿t grant, that the conveniency of tacking the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Wall-Fruit-Trees,</hi> and by that means of conÅ¿training them to lye as we would have them, renders the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them much eaÅ¿ier, more Å¿ecure, and quicker for Å¿ucceÅ¿s, than it can be for <hi>Dwarf-Å¿tandards.</hi>

                           <p>Of what is to be done in CaÅ¿es not foreÅ¿een, and yet pretty common to all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> even to thoÅ¿e that have been manag'd according to all the Rules of Art.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Think I may Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that whoever has with a Å¿ufficient application read over what I have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd here for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> has acquir'd a Å¿ufficient Knowledge, either to underÅ¿tand it well, or to put it in Practice with PleaÅ¿ure and Advantage: To tell the Truth, I Å¿hould be infinitely deceiv'd if it were not Å¿o, having made it my Å¿tudy with all the Care imaginable, to render my Å¿elf intelligible, as well to the Ignorant, and the Novice, as to the Man of UnderÅ¿tanding, whether <hi>Gard'ner</hi> or not, who Å¿hall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿irous to know my Sentiments upon this Matter. But I muÅ¿t add to this, that yet to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to a greater perfection of Knowledge, it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary, for two or three years, to endeavour the putting in Practice upon young <hi>Trees</hi> both the Principles and Manner I uÅ¿e: Experience far exceeding Theory, or Speculation in this CaÅ¿e, as well as in all other practicable Arts and Sciences.</p>
                        <p>I dare affirm, that hardly any difficulty would ever be found in the Application of theÅ¿e Principles, if, as I may Å¿ay, Nature was always wiÅ¿e in the Production of <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Fruits;</hi> or if Å¿he could be govern'd as the Carver governs his Marble, and the Painter his Colours; but it is certain, that whatever care we take for the Conduct of our <hi>Trees,</hi> yet we cannot always Labour about them with Å¿o much Å¿ucceÅ¿s, as to oblige Nature, which we are not altogether maÅ¿ters of, on all OccaÅ¿ions to anÅ¿wer our Intentions and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                        <p>Nature is a particular Agent, but yet a neceÅ¿Å¿ary one, which in her Actions depends upon an infinite number of CircumÅ¿tances, either as to Times, and SeaÅ¿ons, or Grounds, of which, Å¿ome are Good, and others Bad; Å¿ome Hot, Å¿ome Cold, Å¿ome Dry, Å¿ome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48210:152"/>
MoiÅ¿t; or LaÅ¿tly, in relation to the different temper of <hi>Trees,</hi> of which Å¿ome are apter to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> than others; Å¿ome to produce more <hi>Branches,</hi> others leÅ¿s, Å¿ome for Stone-<hi>Fruit,</hi> others for Kernel; and Å¿ome others are even of a particular kind; as <hi>Figgs, Grapes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether I might not Å¿ay, that pretty often the Rules for <hi>Pruning</hi> are in Å¿ome reÅ¿pects the Å¿ame in relation to <hi>Trees,</hi> as the Rules of <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Morality</hi> are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect to the Conduct of Men; our <hi>Trees</hi> to me, Å¿eem impatient under the ConÅ¿traint we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e upon them, to keep them low; and Å¿ometimes tack'd againÅ¿t a Wall; they Å¿eem to aim conÅ¿tantly at their eÅ¿cape, and to Å¿urprize the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> to Å¿hoot where he would not have them, and produce <hi>Branches</hi> where he would have none; juÅ¿t as the Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man often Rebels againÅ¿t the Divine Laws and ReaÅ¿on, and affects moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e things which Morality forbids.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e true, that in our <hi>Trees</hi> there Å¿ometimes happen certain Inconveniencies, which we could neither foreÅ¿ee, nor hinder; but at leaÅ¿t, when they are come to paÅ¿s, we muÅ¿t apply our Å¿elves to avoid the ill ConÅ¿equences that might attend them; and moreover, if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible, as I have pretty often CauÅ¿e to believe it may; we muÅ¿t endeavour to draw Advantages from them.</p>
                        <p>There are in this certain Particulars, which may prove tireÅ¿om to Å¿ome Readers, I mean Å¿uch as have no occaÅ¿ion for them, or Å¿uch as do not care to underÅ¿tand <hi>Pruning</hi> to the bottom; but I hope they may prove of great uÅ¿e, or at leaÅ¿t afford Å¿ome PleaÅ¿ure to true <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who are Å¿enÅ¿ible that nothing is Å¿o proper to improve in all manner of Sciences, as thoÅ¿e Å¿tudied and inÅ¿tructive Particulars.</p>
                        <p>I have in my time made many Remarks upon Å¿everal particular CaÅ¿es relating to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of all manner of <hi>Trees;</hi> which I look upon as proper to be added here, together with the Conduct I have held towards them.</p>
                        <p>But firÅ¿t, I think my Å¿elf oblig'd to Å¿ay that <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially <hi>Peuch-Trees,</hi> and even <hi>Apricocks,</hi> greatly require a Å¿econd <hi>Pruning,</hi> and Å¿ometimes a third, beÅ¿ides the firÅ¿t which is done at the end of Winter: ThoÅ¿e laÅ¿t <hi>Prunings</hi> muÅ¿t be perform'd towards the middle of <hi>May,</hi> when the <hi>Fruit</hi> is either knit, or blaÅ¿ted: At which time, I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they are not only advantageous, but even very neceÅ¿Å¿ary; at the Å¿ame time you muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e Trim the <hi>Buds</hi> and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches</hi> of Å¿ome others, which is no leÅ¿s neceÅ¿Å¿ary than thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Prunings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e laÅ¿t Operations, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Å¿econd and third <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> and the Trimming of the <hi>Buds</hi> and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches</hi> of all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, both to Å¿trengthen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Branches,</hi> which may be of uÅ¿e for the future to make <hi>Branches</hi> for Wood, as well as to take away intirely Å¿ome that are grown uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and inconvenient; their Function which was to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> not having Å¿ucceeded, their <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> being deÅ¿troy'd. I will make a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chapter of this hereafter, after having explain'd all the Particulars I have mention'd for <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All theÅ¿e I have divided into Four ClaÅ¿Å¿is; of which the firÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of thoÅ¿e Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks that are generally common for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of all manner of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> This ClaÅ¿Å¿is has a pretty large extent, and Å¿hall be the firÅ¿t I will Explain.</p>

                        <p>I Shall not need to inlarge upon this Article, of the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning;</hi> having already largely explain'd in General the Rules for all Å¿orts of <hi>Pruning:</hi> I Å¿hall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve, that the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> of the <hi>Trees</hi> above-mention'd, are but of a Å¿mall Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, many of them PeriÅ¿hing the very firÅ¿t year in which they have produc'd <hi>Fruit,</hi> and even without it, their <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> having been Å¿poil'd, either by <hi>Gum, BlaÅ¿ts,</hi> or <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> in the Spring; in which CaÅ¿es, they muÅ¿t be wholly taken away, unleÅ¿s they be grown conÅ¿iderably thick, or have Å¿hot Å¿ome fine <hi>Branches</hi> fit to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the following year; for in that CaÅ¿e, they may laÅ¿t two years, and even Å¿ometimes, though very Å¿eldom, three or four; provided they Å¿till Å¿hoot Å¿ome good <hi>Branches,</hi> either on the Extremity of the laÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> or in their extent: But after that, they muÅ¿t only be look'd upon as worn-out <hi>Branches,</hi> and conÅ¿equently of no uÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>It is not Å¿o with the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> of <hi>Pear</hi> and <hi>Apple-Trees;</hi> and even <hi>Plumb-Trees,</hi> both the one and the other laÅ¿ting pretty long, that is, much longer than thoÅ¿e of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> by reaÅ¿on, that in their extent they Å¿hoot very good Å¿mall ones, which regularly produce <hi>Fruit;</hi> until at laÅ¿t, according to the Nature of <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> they all periÅ¿h intirely.</p>
                        <p>I may Å¿ay here, without any Vanity, that in following my Method of <hi>Pruning Peach-Trees,</hi> you may expect to have commonly much finer <hi>Trees,</hi> more laÅ¿ting, and without doubt much more <hi>Fruit,</hi> and even much finer than thoÅ¿e who <hi>Prune</hi> another way, which is Infallible; provided the Weather be fair at the time of the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> and the <hi>Gum</hi> Å¿poil nothing about the <hi>Branches,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially, that the <hi>Trees</hi> be Planted in a good Ground. The Curious are much to be pity'd, when their <hi>Gardens</hi> happen to be in a cold ill Ground, or when the Mould is worn, becauÅ¿e that the <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿eldom produce any good new <hi>Roots</hi> there; and conÅ¿equently, abundance of the old ones periÅ¿h, <hi>Roots</hi> not being able to Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t without Action; which is the ReaÅ¿on that Å¿o much Gum grows both upon the <hi>Stem,</hi> and upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> and even upon the Foot, and in the <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48210:158"/>
The ReaÅ¿on for which I Å¿ay that my Method of <hi>Pruning</hi> greatly preÅ¿erves and imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hes the <hi>Trees,</hi> is becauÅ¿e it preÅ¿cribes the being very careful in keeping pretty Å¿hort all the thick <hi>Branches, &amp;c.</hi> And as for the abundance of fine <hi>Fruits,</hi> it depends Infallibly on the other Caution I recommend, of preÅ¿erving all the good <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> without taking away any, and the leaving no more <hi>Fruit</hi> upon them than they are able to nouriÅ¿h, in order to its being very Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>When in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> you deÅ¿ign to perform the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning</hi> upon <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and that, after having taken away all the Old dry <hi>Branches,</hi> or Å¿uch, which through an extream weakneÅ¿s, are of no uÅ¿e (for you muÅ¿t begin by this, in order to Å¿ee clearly and diÅ¿tinctly what is to be done) you find only two Å¿orts of good <hi>Branches</hi> remaining; of which, the one (which are weak ones) are to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the following years, the <hi>Buds</hi> being already form'd; and the others (which are the Å¿trong ones) are not commonly to produce any, not having any <hi>Buds</hi> upon them, but are to Å¿erve us for another uÅ¿e, which is very material.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e weak ones are to be preÅ¿erv'd with Care, and even of a great length, by reaÅ¿on of the viÅ¿ible appearance of preÅ¿ent <hi>Fruit,</hi> but without building any hopes upon moÅ¿t of them for the following year; Nature will afford us others, to Å¿upply the loÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e; but Å¿till care muÅ¿t be taken, that the length of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> be proportion'd to their Å¿trength; being alÅ¿o perÅ¿waded, that a <hi>Branch</hi> of an ordinary thickneÅ¿s is capable of nouriÅ¿hing a conÅ¿iderable part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> it Å¿eems diÅ¿pos'd to bear: So that, at the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> there is no danger in venturing to leave much upon it, provided part be taken away at the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, if there be ReaÅ¿on to believe there is too much.</p>
                        <p>As to the Å¿trong ones, they muÅ¿t particularly be look'd upon in relation to the future, and therefore muÅ¿t be cut Å¿hort, in proÅ¿pect, that, according to the Order of Nature, they will produce others of two kinds; Å¿ome thick ones for <hi>Wood,</hi> and many Å¿mall ones for <hi>Fruit;</hi> which will certainly come to paÅ¿s: But, above all, Care muÅ¿t be taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the <hi>Branches</hi> that are to fill up the room of thoÅ¿e Å¿lender ones, which, for the time being, produce Å¿o good an Effect, but are, as it were, no longer to be look'd upon as living, Å¿ince, after their having produc'd their <hi>Fruit,</hi> they muÅ¿t be taken away.</p>
                        <p>We have Å¿ufficiently explain'd the difference there is between weak <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s</hi> ones; therefore it will Å¿uffice to Å¿ay, that no long <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd, unleÅ¿s they be of a moderate thickneÅ¿s, and have at the Å¿ame time <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> ready form'd for the preÅ¿ent Year. I commonly call none <hi>Buds</hi> but Å¿uch as are double, with an <hi>Eye</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> in the middle; and I value no others for PreÅ¿erving, unleÅ¿s it be on <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Peaches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, no <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿hort, unleÅ¿s it be, that, being incapable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fruit</hi> in the preÅ¿ent Year, their Strength or Vigour may promiÅ¿e other <hi>Branches</hi> for the following Year; or that the <hi>Tree</hi> having a vaÅ¿t quantity of <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> and very few for <hi>Wood,</hi> and all thoÅ¿e very high, there may be reaÅ¿on to fear, that Å¿ome of the lower parts, or the middle, may grow too thin for the following Years; in which CaÅ¿e, it is very proper to Å¿acrifice Å¿ome <hi>Buds;</hi> and to that End, Å¿horten Å¿ome of the fineÅ¿t and thickeÅ¿t among thoÅ¿e that are over-burthen'd by them, and Å¿o make them, as we have Å¿aid elÅ¿ewhere, <hi>Demy-Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> which is of very good uÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time we muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve that there are Å¿ome very vigorous <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> which commonly are hard to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> upon which it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, as well as upon Å¿ome furious <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> to leave <hi>Branches</hi> of a moderate thickneÅ¿s, long, though they have no <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> at all. Such furious <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are your <hi>Magdalens,</hi> Å¿ome white <hi>BaÅ¿tard-Peaches, Bourdins, Brugnons,</hi> or Latter <hi>Violets, &amp;c.</hi> that is, when thoÅ¿e <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are young: Upon Å¿uch it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to leave Å¿ome long <hi>Branches,</hi> though without any appearance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> upon the apparent certainty of their producing a great many other weak <hi>Branches</hi> for the following Year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>; and though thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> be pretty thick, and might be look'd upon as <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> yet they are not cut Å¿hort, becauÅ¿e it is probable that in their Neighbourhood there may be other thicker that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> and that, according to the beÅ¿t Rules, many thick <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t never be left very near one to another.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e different ways of Cutting long or Å¿hort, are the CauÅ¿e that it cannot, and muÅ¿t not be Å¿aid that a <hi>Peach-Tree</hi> is well <hi>Prun'd,</hi> unleÅ¿s every <hi>Branch;</hi> has one of thoÅ¿e two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, either actually fit to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> in the preÅ¿ent Year, or to produce fine <hi>Wood</hi> the Year following, in thoÅ¿e places where it may be requir'd; and when theÅ¿e two Conditions meet, and are perfectly obÅ¿erv'd, we may Å¿ay that a <hi>Peach-Tree</hi> is very well <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e kind of Regards muÅ¿t not only be had at the time of the firÅ¿t <hi>Pruning,</hi> but, yet particularly, at the time of the Å¿econd and third, if perform'd; and likewiÅ¿e at the time of the <hi>Trimming</hi> of the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches.</hi>

The MiÅ¿chief which attends <hi>Gum,</hi> to which every body knows <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ubject, and even much beyond all other <hi>Stone-Fruits,</hi> hinders us from having any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that a thick <hi>Branch,</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> will produce others on its Extremity; which is almoÅ¿t infallible in <hi>Pear, Plumb,</hi> and <hi>Apricock-Trees, &amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> appear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd with that <hi>Gum,</hi> and yet the Owners are willing to preÅ¿erve them Å¿ome Years longer, they muÅ¿t <hi>Prune</hi> them late, that is, about the time they begin to <hi>bloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> and <hi>Å¿hoot,</hi> to be certain of preÅ¿erving, at leaÅ¿t, Å¿ome good <hi>Eyes,</hi> and Å¿ome good <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms:</hi> There can be no Certainty before that time.</p>
                        <p>I add farther, that when a <hi>Peach-Tree</hi> has produc'd no <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> it muÅ¿t no longer be conÅ¿ider'd as a <hi>Tree</hi> to keep, from the time the <hi>Fruit</hi> has been gather'd; and a SucceÅ¿Å¿or muÅ¿t be provided.</p>
                        <p>I add beÅ¿ides, that if it happens that an old <hi>Peach-Tree,</hi> having been Å¿horten'd, has produc'd Å¿everal <hi>Branches,</hi> which happens but Å¿eldom, unleÅ¿s it be a <hi>Tree</hi> grown from a <hi>Stone,</hi> you muÅ¿t begin to <hi>Prune</hi> it upon thoÅ¿e new <hi>Branches,</hi> in the Å¿elf-Å¿ame manner as a young <hi>Tree</hi> is <hi>Prun'd;</hi> excepting only, that the <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be left a little longer, for fear of the <hi>Gum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible not to be very uneaÅ¿ie at the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of an itching deÅ¿ire of preÅ¿erving all the <hi>Buds</hi> that are ready form'd for the preÅ¿ent Year, and of not depriving ones Å¿elf of a preÅ¿ent Good: But yet, unleÅ¿s you be a little hard-hearted for the preÅ¿ent, in proÅ¿pect of the future, you may aÅ¿Å¿ure your Å¿elves to Å¿ee thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees</hi> periÅ¿h by your own Fault, or, at leaÅ¿t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of no uÅ¿e. 'Tis true, that in Å¿o doing, you may perhaps get abundance of <hi>Fruit</hi> for two or three Years; but it is as true, that after that, you muÅ¿t expect a very great Scarcity, and very ugly <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e UneaÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es, or Conflicts, I have mention'd, are only undergone by skilful <hi>Gard'ners:</hi> Others are not Å¿o much as Å¿enÅ¿ible of the Danger, and Å¿o are liable to no manner of Agitation. The chief CauÅ¿e of DiÅ¿quiet is, particularly, when a weak <hi>Branch,</hi> that had been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> is grown thick, contrary to the common Order of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that the thick one, which had been cut Å¿hort, in order to <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> abundance of new ones, is, as it were, abandon'd, and hardly produces any thing. This Alteration ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally produces a great DiÅ¿order in a <hi>Tree;</hi> for thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Branches</hi> that are grown thick, have probably Å¿hot a great many <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> which occaÅ¿ions a very great and juÅ¿t CauÅ¿e of Temptation and DeÅ¿ire of preÅ¿erving them all: So that, unleÅ¿s the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire of having a fine and laÅ¿ting <hi>Tree</hi> oppoÅ¿es the Itch of preÅ¿erving thoÅ¿e Appearances of preÅ¿ent <hi>Fruit,</hi> there is a great deal of danger of being overcome by the Temptation; and conÅ¿equently, of making Å¿oon a very ugly <hi>Tree,</hi> as we have already inÅ¿tanc'd. Therefore it is very material to examine what is moÅ¿t proper to be done in Å¿uch Conjunctures.</p>
                        <p>It is Å¿ometimes neceÅ¿Å¿ary to take the advantage of Å¿uch a DiÅ¿order, to let the <hi>Tree Å¿hoot</hi> up, in order to cover the Top of a Wall, which may very well be allow'd of; and in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, there will be no need of taking any of theÅ¿e terrible ReÅ¿olutions: But Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there may be a great deal of danger in Å¿o doing; in which CaÅ¿e, there is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of reÅ¿olving to Å¿acrifice part of thoÅ¿e fine Appearances of <hi>Fruit,</hi> without any Mercy, and conÅ¿equently, to Å¿horten Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> extreamly, in proÅ¿pect, that in the following Years you Å¿hall be recompenc'd a hundred times for thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> which, as I may Å¿ay, have been thus cruelly deÅ¿troy'd. This DiÅ¿order happens but Å¿eldom, which is a Comfort; but yet, as it happens Å¿ometimes, I thought my Å¿elf oblig'd to give my Opinion about it.</p>
                        <p>When Walls are very low, for Example, about Å¿ix or Å¿even Foot high, and yet People deÅ¿ire to have <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> againÅ¿t them, which, in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, muÅ¿t be <hi>Planted</hi> at a great diÅ¿tance from one another; when, I Å¿ay, along Å¿uch low Walls <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> appear to be very vigorous, for the two firÅ¿t Years the thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are to fill up the Sides muÅ¿t be kept pretty long, becauÅ¿e, that in <hi>Pruning</hi> of them Å¿hort, they will only <hi>Å¿hoot FalÅ¿e-Wood,</hi> or <hi>Suckers,</hi> and Å¿eldom or never produce any <hi>Fruit,</hi> you may allow them twice the length of what is allow'd to common <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and Å¿ometimes even thrice; that is, a Foot and a half, or Å¿omewhat more.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> is reaÅ¿onably vigorous, it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be allow'd at leaÅ¿t three Foot of Wall free, above the <hi>Pruning</hi> that is perform'd upon it in the Spring, for the placing of the new <hi>Shoots;</hi> otherwiÅ¿e the greateÅ¿t part of the principal <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hould be of no uÅ¿e, growing over the Top; and there Å¿hould be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Cutting them often during the Summer, leÅ¿t the great Winds Å¿hould break them: And, beÅ¿ides the Vexation of not enjoying the Benefit of the Vigour of ones <hi>Trees,</hi> thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> thus cut, ever look ungainly upon a <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> by the quantity of <hi>Furzes</hi> that appear at the Extremity of Å¿uch a <hi>Tree.</hi>

                           <p>Particular Remarks upon the Second and Third <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THeÅ¿e Second and Third <hi>Prunings</hi> are altogether new, and yet are altogether as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary and material as the firÅ¿t, and muÅ¿t be perform'd about the middle of <hi>May</hi> only upon weak <hi>Branches:</hi> They were left long by the Winter-<hi>Pruning,</hi> in proÅ¿pect of abundance of <hi>Fruit;</hi> but whereas they are Å¿ubject to certain CircumÅ¿tances we are going to examine, they made us bethink our Å¿elves of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of a Å¿econd Operation, and Å¿ometimes of a third.</p>
                        <p>As to the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿hort in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> they have Å¿ufficiently undergone the DiÅ¿penÅ¿ation of the <hi>Knife,</hi> they require no more of it, their Function not being to produce any thing that wants Retrenching at this time; but, on the contrary, to <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> many precious <hi>Branches,</hi> that deÅ¿erve to be preÅ¿erv'd with much Care.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e laÅ¿t <hi>Prunings,</hi> we are now explaining, are of great uÅ¿e for the grand <hi>Pruning</hi> that is to be perform'd the following Year, in cleanÅ¿ing a <hi>Tree</hi> from all Å¿uperfluous and half-dead <hi>Branches,</hi> which wou'd only create a ConfuÅ¿ion: They Strengthen other <hi>Branches</hi> that will be of uÅ¿e in the Sequel, by affording them the <hi>Sap,</hi> which wou'd be waÅ¿ted on thoÅ¿e Å¿curvy ones that can never be of any uÅ¿e, and muÅ¿t of CourÅ¿e be taken away the Winter following. It likewiÅ¿e contributes towards the Beauty and GoodneÅ¿s of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and Å¿erves to keep a <hi>Tree</hi> equally well furniÅ¿h'd; Å¿o that, by that means, Å¿eldom, or never, any Defects wou'd appear upon any of thoÅ¿e <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> unleÅ¿s they were perÅ¿ecuted by that curÅ¿ed <hi>Gum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e are the ConÅ¿equences of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Branches,</hi> upon which the above-mention'd <hi>Prunings</hi> are perform'd. I deÅ¿ire all <hi>Gard'ners</hi> to follow this DiÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion exactly.</p>
                        <p>TheÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> which I have a particular regard for, in relation to <hi>Fruit,</hi> Å¿hall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd one of theÅ¿e Å¿ix things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> They may either have produc'd, almoÅ¿t in their whole Extent, a great deal of <hi>Fruit</hi> and fine <hi>Branches,</hi> or much <hi>Fruit</hi> and ugly <hi>Branches.</hi> By fine <hi>Branches</hi> here, I mean, Å¿uch as are thick enough to prove <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> the following Year, and in the mean time bear abundance of fine <hi>Leaves:</hi> And, on the contrary, I call thoÅ¿e poor and ugly, that are Å¿hort and Å¿lender, and are incapable of bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> only producing Å¿mall <hi>Leaves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> ThoÅ¿e <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> may chance only to have born <hi>Fruit</hi> upon part of their Length; for Example, the fourth part, third, or half, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to have Å¿hot either fine or ugly <hi>Branches</hi> every where, or in Å¿ome part; and all this, perchance, towards the upper end, and Å¿ometimes towards the lower.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They may chance to have produc'd no <hi>Fruit,</hi> but abundance of fine <hi>Branches;</hi> or many altogether ugly and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They may only have produc'd a Å¿ingle <hi>Branch</hi> on the Extremity, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Fruit</hi> every where, or without any <hi>Fruit</hi> any where.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They may only have produc'd one Å¿ingle <hi>Fruit</hi> on the Extremity, with Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> in part of their Extent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> They may be kill'd with <hi>Gum</hi> or Cold in their whole Extent, or only towards the Extremity.</p>
                        <p>I have had the Experience of all theÅ¿e CaÅ¿es Å¿everal times, in all which I have held the following Method.</p>
                        <p>In the firÅ¿t part of the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> Å¿hall have produc'd <hi>Fruit</hi> and fine <hi>Branches</hi> in the beÅ¿t part of their Extent, we may rejoice at the Abundance; for, without doubt, all will go well, Å¿ince the Appearances are Å¿o fair as far as the Month of <hi>May:</hi> Some of the <hi>Fruit</hi> only muÅ¿t be taken away, where it lies Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that we may have cauÅ¿e to believe that, in growing, they might obÅ¿truct each other; for that wou'd Å¿poil it: And likewiÅ¿e, in caÅ¿e any ConfuÅ¿ion be threaten'd by that Multitude of new <hi>Branches,</hi> Å¿ome of the meaneÅ¿t, and worÅ¿t plac'd, may be remov'd. It is always to be wiÅ¿h'd, that the Lot of being retrench'd may fall upon the fartheÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd Part of the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Branch</hi> has produc'd a great deal of <hi>Fruit,</hi> but no fine <hi>Branches;</hi> on the contrary, all weak and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s; the beÅ¿t part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> muÅ¿t be taken away, Å¿ince it wou'd neither grow beautiful nor good; only Å¿ome of that which looks beÅ¿t, and is beÅ¿t plac'd, may be preÅ¿erv'd; that is, that which grows in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48210:160"/>
the loweÅ¿t part of the <hi>Branch.</hi> At the Å¿ame time the Å¿aid <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be very much Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, to reduce it to the Å¿econd or third <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> of the bottom, in order to Å¿trengthen Å¿ome of the beÅ¿t <hi>Branches</hi> that are upon it, for the next Year.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> only produces <hi>Fruit</hi> upon part of its Length, if the <hi>Fruit</hi> be grown upon the lower part of it, the <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd, and Å¿horten'd cloÅ¿e to that, among the new ones, which appears fineÅ¿t, and neareÅ¿t to that <hi>Fruit;</hi> it is enough when there remains one or two paÅ¿Å¿able good ones.</p>
                        <p>In caÅ¿e the <hi>Fruit</hi> be pretty abundant, and towards the upper Extremity, that having likewiÅ¿e pretty fine <hi>Branches,</hi> that <hi>Fruit</hi> muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be preÅ¿erv'd, and all the uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches</hi> remov'd, in the manner aboveÅ¿aid; only preÅ¿erving one or two of thoÅ¿e that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the fineÅ¿t, whatever part they be in, eÅ¿pecially being in the lower part, where we are always deÅ¿irous of them; for, as to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> 'tis always well plac'd, where-ever it be, even at the end of the <hi>Branches;</hi> provided always, that in preÅ¿erving one or two fine <hi>Branches</hi> on the Extremity of a <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> that has been kept of a great length, you muÅ¿t reÅ¿olve the following Year to retrench both the Mother and Daughter, or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, otherwiÅ¿e one part wou'd grow too thin.</p>
                        <p>In the firÅ¿t part of the third CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Branch</hi> has really produc'd no <hi>Fruit,</hi> but, to make amends, has Å¿hot a great many fine new <hi>Branches;</hi> in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, it is fit, as much as can be, to preÅ¿erve the beÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> being careful of not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any of them grow Å¿tronger than the other, eÅ¿pecially towards the Extremity, for Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> wou'd ruin all the lower; therefore Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t be wholly taken away, and <hi>Pinch'd</hi> or broken within two or three <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> as we have heretofore explain'd.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd Part of that third CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> has neither been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in <hi>Fruit,</hi> nor in <hi>Wood</hi> of a favourable Growth, you muÅ¿t wholly Å¿horten Å¿uch a <hi>Branch,</hi> to a Å¿ingle one of thoÅ¿e it has produc'd; and chuÅ¿e the loweÅ¿t, in hopes to Å¿trengthen it, to make it good for the next Year, or take it quite away, it not anÅ¿wering our Intentions.</p>
                        <p>In the firÅ¿t Part of the Fourth CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> has only produc'd a Å¿ingle <hi>Branch</hi> on the Extremity, with abundance of <hi>Fruit</hi> every where, I am of Opinion that Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hou'd be preÅ¿erv'd, provided it does not incline to become a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> in which caÅ¿e it muÅ¿t be broken pretty Å¿hort: So that, in caÅ¿e Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> be but moderately thick, it promiÅ¿es much for the following Year; and as for all the little dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive <hi>Branches,</hi> that grow among the <hi>Fruit</hi> it bears, we <hi>Prune</hi> them, as we have declar'd in the ExpoÅ¿ition of the Å¿econd CaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>Therefore there is yet more reaÅ¿on to uÅ¿e all the little <hi>Branches</hi> we meet with here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Fruit</hi> in the Extent of the <hi>Branch</hi> in debate in the Å¿ame manner, being certain that, for the generality, they <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> no more, being all at a Å¿tand in the Month of <hi>June:</hi> So that all our Comfort for the following Year lies in the fine <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> that offers it Å¿elf here, on the Extremity of the <hi>Branch</hi> that has bloÅ¿Å¿om'd to no purpoÅ¿e in all its Extent.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Branch</hi> that was left long, to bear a great deal of <hi>Fruit,</hi> has yet been Å¿o unfortunate, or abus'd, as not to have retain'd above one or two on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of it, and yet has Å¿hot Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> in part of its Extent.</p>
                        <p>Several particular Regards muÅ¿t be had in this CaÅ¿e: For Example, If the <hi>Tree,</hi> on the other hand, has but little <hi>Fruit,</hi> for that being one will be tempted, and that with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, to preÅ¿erve that which is known to be good, in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e it will be proper not to meddle with Å¿uch a <hi>Branch;</hi> or elÅ¿e, to obÅ¿erve whether the <hi>Tree</hi> has produc'd a great deal of <hi>Fruit</hi> in the main; in which CaÅ¿e, no great difficulty muÅ¿t be made of loÅ¿ing Å¿o little, and conÅ¿equently, of <hi>Pruning</hi> Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> again Å¿hort, in order to Å¿trengthen Å¿ome other that appears pretty good, and is well plac'd; which we may Å¿tand in need of for the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and for the hopes of future Years.</p>
                        <p>It will likewiÅ¿e be proper to conÅ¿ider whether the Year be univerÅ¿ally barren, which wou'd hinder the Operation I have been adviÅ¿ing; or whether it be a doubtful <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which, it wou'd be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to know the kind, either to Å¿uppreÅ¿s, or multiply it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which CaÅ¿e, it will be fit to preÅ¿erve this Å¿ingle <hi>Peach,</hi> or thoÅ¿e two <hi>Peaches,</hi> that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on the top of the <hi>Branch</hi> in queÅ¿tion, though with Å¿ome Regret, out of a juÅ¿t fear of a future Deformity in that <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For, in fine, the principal thing to be done in the Management of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> is, to prefer the Beauty of the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> in hopes of a future Abundance; I Å¿ay, to prefer the Beauty of that <hi>Tree</hi> to a Å¿mall quantity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> though really preÅ¿ent.</p>
                        <p>In fine, In the Å¿ixth CaÅ¿e, in which the <hi>Branches</hi> are deÅ¿troy'd by <hi>Gum,</hi> or Cold, it is neither difficult to give a good Advice, or to take it; for you muÅ¿t wholly take away all that is dead, and conÅ¿equently uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and diÅ¿agreeable to Sight, in any part whatever, particularly on the Extremity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48210:160"/>
This is my Method for the Second <hi>Pruning.</hi> If any thing has hinder'd the performing of it about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> it may be done until the middle of <hi>June;</hi> Å¿o that even a Third may be perform'd at that time, when on the Second of the middle of <hi>May,</hi> it has been thought fit to venture Å¿till Å¿ome Lengths of <hi>Branches,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e an Effect of the Second <hi>Pruning,</hi> to cut all the Å¿mall, Å¿apleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> that grow within the compaÅ¿s of the Å¿ine one, which has been produc'd that very Year; as alÅ¿o, to Å¿horten, in <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> that are weak, and at a Å¿tand.</p>
                        <p>I add, that the performing of Å¿uch an Operation is very material, but that unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is hardly practis'd at all, or, at leaÅ¿t, Å¿o Å¿eldom, either out of LazineÅ¿s, or for want of time; the <hi>Gardner</hi> having, perhaps, too great a number of <hi>Trees,</hi> and other Works, that overwhelm him.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I ObÅ¿erve, among <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> three different Methods of Ordering all manner of <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> in the Summer, in relation to the young <hi>Branches</hi> they produce. The FirÅ¿t tear or pull off indifferently all thoÅ¿e that grow before and behind, and leave but few others: ThoÅ¿e Å¿eem to me extreamly to blame, and unworthy the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion they follow.</p>
                        <p>The Second cut all thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> within three or four <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> and by that means occaÅ¿ion abundance of <hi>Fruz,</hi> among which there Å¿ometimes grows a little <hi>Fruit,</hi> but that is pretty rare: BeÅ¿ides that, this Method renders the <hi>Trees</hi> ugly, and diÅ¿agreeable; and therefore I diÅ¿approve it.</p>
                        <p>LaÅ¿tly, The Third preÅ¿erve in the Summer all the good <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>PalliÅ¿ado</hi> them neatly; tarrying to chuÅ¿e the beÅ¿t until the SeaÅ¿on of <hi>Pruning:</hi> ThoÅ¿e, in my Opinion, are in the right, and I imitate them as much as I can.</p>

                           <p>Of the <hi>Triming</hi> of Å¿uperfluous needleÅ¿s <hi>Buds</hi> and <hi>Sprigs.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WHereas <hi>Pruning</hi> only Å¿erves barely to Å¿horten, or wholly to take away Å¿ome old <hi>Branches,</hi> that, either by their length, Å¿ituation, or number, annoy a <hi>Tree;</hi> Å¿o this <hi>Triming</hi> or <hi>Picking,</hi> is only to deÅ¿troy, and entirely remove young <hi>Branches</hi> of the Year, either thick, or Å¿mall, growing improperly, and capable of cauÅ¿ing a ConfuÅ¿ion, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing either the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> or only the <hi>Branch</hi> on which they are grown.</p>
                        <p>The Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> as we have declar'd, is from <hi>November,</hi> to the End of <hi>March;</hi> which <hi>Pruning</hi> muÅ¿t be perform'd regularly every Year; whereas the Time of the <hi>Triming</hi> is commonly about <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and Å¿ometimes <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and Å¿ometimes it is not done at all; but when there is CauÅ¿e for it, it muÅ¿t not be neglected; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it cannot be done too Å¿oon, to prevent the Growth of thoÅ¿e uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Shoots,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently, the waÅ¿ting a great deal of <hi>Sap</hi> unprofitably, which might be employ'd to better UÅ¿es: So that when it has been neglected, or not perform'd Å¿oon enough, it muÅ¿t be done late, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, Å¿ince it is better to do a neceÅ¿Å¿ary thing late than never.</p>
                        <p>It is not eaÅ¿ie to Å¿et down preciÅ¿ely what <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿o <hi>Prun'd,</hi> or <hi>Trim'd,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to Å¿atisfie thoÅ¿e, among the Curious, who know but little, and are only Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: But a skilful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who, by the Rules heretofore eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, has form'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf the <hi>Idea</hi> of a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> and conÅ¿equently muÅ¿t know partly what <hi>Branches</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, as well for the Beauty of the Figure, as for <hi>Fruit;</hi> Å¿uch a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> I Å¿ay, muÅ¿t needs, at firÅ¿t Å¿ight, know thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> that are no ways anÅ¿werable to the <hi>Idea</hi> he has conceiv'd, and conÅ¿equently take them away at their very Birth, or at leaÅ¿t from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he perceives them, eÅ¿pecially before the End of Summer; that is, before the <hi>Trees</hi> have made an end of <hi>Å¿hooting,</hi> or that Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> are grown thick; otherwiÅ¿e they muÅ¿t remain until the time of <hi>Pruning:</hi> But, generally Å¿peaking, I may Å¿ay, that this <hi>Triming</hi> or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48210:161"/>
                           <hi>Picking,</hi> is to retrench or take off all ill-plac'd <hi>Branches Å¿hooting</hi> from any part whatever, whether good or bad: eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion, without being proper either for <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Fruit.</hi> The Knowledge of the Order in which the <hi>Branches</hi> grow, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or ill, which we have clearly explain'd at the beginning of this TreatiÅ¿e, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary for this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> muÅ¿t particularly be look'd to, from the very Beginning of <hi>April,</hi> to the End, that if, from a Å¿lanting <hi>Cut,</hi> which was to produce a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> outwardly, there Å¿hould grow a thick one inwardly, it may be taken away immediately, in ConÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the two ReaÅ¿ons which ordain <hi>Trimming.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e neceÅ¿Å¿ary to take away the <hi>Branches</hi> which hinder others that are better plac'd, and Å¿hould be more uÅ¿eful, from receiving a due NouriÅ¿hment; For Example, Take away high <hi>Branches,</hi> to favour low ones; by which means they would grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable; whereas without Å¿uch a help, they would remain uprofitable, and the <hi>Tree</hi> would Å¿uffer, both as to the Figure, and the <hi>Fruit</hi> we expect from it.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Trimming</hi> or <hi>Pruning,</hi> is perform'd upon young <hi>Trees,</hi> as well as old ones; and therefore, when a young <hi>Tree</hi> at once <hi>Å¿hoots</hi> high and low <hi>Branches,</hi> with a great Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or Å¿pace between them, it is proper to take away the higheÅ¿t, when the loweÅ¿t are deÅ¿ign'd to be preÅ¿erv'd; or elÅ¿e the loweÅ¿t, when the others deÅ¿erve it better: Which is not only to be done by way of <hi>Trimming,</hi> but alÅ¿o by the real way of <hi>Pruning,</hi> that is, with the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> when the bare <hi>Trimming</hi> or <hi>Nipping</hi> is not Å¿ufficient.</p>
                        <p>If, upon any <hi>Tree</hi> whatever, one and the Å¿ame <hi>Eye</hi> produces two or three <hi>Branches,</hi> Å¿ome of them muÅ¿t be taken away by way of <hi>Nipping off,</hi> to better the Condition of the others, as well as to avoid ConfuÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p>So that upon a weak <hi>Branch,</hi> which, from one <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud, Å¿hoots,</hi> for inÅ¿tance, two or three, and all probably weak, I will only preÅ¿erve one, chuÅ¿ing that which appears to be the beÅ¿t, that is, the thickeÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>But if, on the contrary, a very vigorous <hi>Branch Å¿hoots</hi> three from one and the Å¿ame <hi>Eye,</hi> and that the middlemoÅ¿t appears too Å¿trong, and the worÅ¿t plac'd, I Å¿hall, without doubt, take it away, to Å¿trengthen the two others a little; which may afterwards, the one on one Å¿ide, and the other on the other, prove very Å¿erviceable to the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So upon very vigorous <hi>Trees,</hi> it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, at the <hi>Nipping off</hi> or <hi>Trimming,</hi> to take away Å¿ome of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> always preÅ¿erving Å¿uch as are Å¿omewhat leÅ¿s, provided they Å¿eem to be good; and eÅ¿pecially, when the thick <hi>Branch</hi> that has been <hi>Prun'd Å¿hoots</hi> many, whence ConfuÅ¿ion proceeds, the higheÅ¿t muÅ¿t be taken away, taking Care however not to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees</hi> too much, which, by reaÅ¿on of their great Vigour, hardly produce any other but thick <hi>Branches;</hi> whereas, on the contrary, upon <hi>Trees</hi> that have not much Vigour, all the Å¿lendereÅ¿t and pooreÅ¿t muÅ¿t be taken off, in order to Å¿trengthen thoÅ¿e that appear Å¿tronger, and yet are not Å¿o Å¿trong as they Å¿hould be.</p>
                        <p>From thence it is eaÅ¿ie to conclude, that Å¿ome <hi>Trees</hi> may as well be prejudic'd by <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off</hi> of them too much, as others by not being <hi>Nipp'd off</hi> enough: The <hi>Gard'ner</hi>'s Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h between thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e great Vigour requires one kind of <hi>Nipping off,</hi> or <hi>Trimming,</hi> and thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e WeakneÅ¿s requires another.</p>
                        <p>I will Å¿ay by the by, that if it be judg'd that many <hi>Cyons</hi> may be requir'd to <hi>Graff Scutcheon-wiÅ¿e,</hi> it will be fit to be Å¿omewhat more cautious in the <hi>Nipping off</hi> of vigorous <hi>Trees,</hi> which may furniÅ¿h <hi>Graffs;</hi> Å¿till taking Care that it may not prejudice the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the following Year.</p>
                        <p>It happens pretty often, that for want of having <hi>Nipp'd off,</hi> or <hi>PalliÅ¿ado'd</hi> prudently, we Å¿ee that, in the ConfuÅ¿ion of <hi>Branches,</hi> Å¿ome long Å¿lender ones <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> out; which muÅ¿t be carefully taken away at the SeaÅ¿on of <hi>Pruning,</hi> or, at leaÅ¿t, Å¿horten'd to an <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> being commonly naught.</p>
                        <p>It likewiÅ¿e commonly happens, that the <hi>Branch</hi> of a <hi>Peach-Tree Å¿hoots</hi> others in the very Summer, which has produc'd it, in which CaÅ¿e it muÅ¿t be examin'd and (if very poor) <hi>Nipp'd off,</hi> or taken away, in any part whatever: But if of a good thickneÅ¿s, having dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> Å¿o as to be fit to make a <hi>Fruit-Branch,</hi> it muÅ¿t be carefully preÅ¿erv'd, though only grown in <hi>July.</hi> And if the lower part of Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hould produce one of a reaÅ¿onable thickneÅ¿s, Å¿o as to be proper for a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> it muÅ¿t be look'd upon as a very good Omen for the Beauty and PreÅ¿ervation of the <hi>Tree:</hi> But if, on the contrary, the upper part of Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hould <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> any which Å¿hould grow Å¿o thick as to be only fit for a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> it muÅ¿t be taken away, as being in a place where we have no occaÅ¿ion for a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> beÅ¿ides, it would prejudice the Mother that produc'd it.</p>
                        <p>It is not much to be queÅ¿tion'd, but that, as in <hi>Pruning</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> while in <hi>Sap,</hi> we viÅ¿ibly loÅ¿e a great deal of <hi>Sap</hi> through the part Å¿o <hi>Prun'd,</hi> Å¿o in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> Å¿ome of the <hi>Sap</hi>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48210:161"/>
evaporates, or is waÅ¿ted through the place that is cut at the time of <hi>Shooting,</hi> which is in the Summer.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e obÅ¿erv'd in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Melons,</hi> that a <hi>Branch,</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> produces more new ones than that which was left <hi>Unprun'd;</hi> and therefore I adviÅ¿e the <hi>Pruning</hi> of too vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> late: For it is obÅ¿ervable in <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> that a thick, young <hi>Branch,</hi> having been cut in the Summer-time, Å¿eldom <hi>Å¿hoots</hi> afterwards, or, at leaÅ¿t, very inconÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably, inÅ¿omuch that the end of it blackens and dies; the ConÅ¿equence of which is, that the neighbouring <hi>Branches</hi> thereby commonly grow the more vigorous. But, indeed, neither this <hi>Nipping off,</hi> nor the <hi>Pinching,</hi> or <hi>Breaking,</hi> do waÅ¿te <hi>Sap</hi> at this rate; and are Å¿o far from being dangerous Operations to be perform'd in the Summer, as is the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> with a <hi>Knife,</hi> that they are very uÅ¿eful, and often very neceÅ¿Å¿ary.</p>
                        <p>Though this <hi>Nipping off</hi> properly relates only to the removing of <hi>Buds,</hi> it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e be underÅ¿tood for the <hi>Plucking off</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> eÅ¿pecially <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> when there is too much in one place; this <hi>Plucking off</hi> being perform'd at the Å¿ame time with the <hi>Nipping off:</hi> Which Matter I treat of at large in another place, and Å¿o Å¿hall Å¿ay no more of it here.</p>
                        <p>When any <hi>Branch</hi> (which Å¿eem'd to be good at the time of <hi>Pruning</hi> it, and therefore was preÅ¿erv'd) grows poor, for want of a good Supply of new <hi>Sap,</hi> which happens Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by an inward DiÅ¿order, which could not be prevented; in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, there is no other Remedy, than the taking away of Å¿uch a <hi>Branch,</hi> as Å¿oon as perceiv'd. Sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o Å¿ome uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches</hi> may have been left by Negligence, or want of Application; which muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be remov'd, as Å¿oon as obÅ¿erv'd: And Å¿uppoÅ¿ing Å¿ome fine <hi>Fruit</hi> may be left on the Extremity of a <hi>Branch</hi> that has produc'd no new <hi>Wood,</hi> which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in that CaÅ¿e the <hi>Branch</hi> muÅ¿t not be taken off until the <hi>Fruit</hi> be gather'd; after which, it muÅ¿t be remov'd, Å¿ince it could never be good for any thing.</p>

                           <hi>PInching,</hi> in relation to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> is, to break deÅ¿ignedly a tender <hi>Sprig</hi> of any <hi>Plant</hi> whatever, and that without the help of any InÅ¿trument, only uÅ¿ing the Nails of two Fingers. This way of <hi>Breaking</hi> has ever been practis'd upon the <hi>Shoots</hi> of <hi>Melons, Cowcumbers, &amp;c.</hi> but I do not know that ever it was practis'd upon any <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> yet I have thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>it to make uÅ¿e of it, though only upon four kind of <hi>Fruit-Trees, viz. Pear, Peach, Fig,</hi> and <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> and I Å¿hall only treat here of what relates to the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> of vigorous <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and the thick new <hi>Branches Å¿hooting</hi> from Å¿lit <hi>Graffs</hi> made upon old <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> being Å¿till in a pretty good CaÅ¿e: I will treat in other places of what relates to the <hi>Pinching</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> and even of <hi>Strawberry-Plants,</hi> and <hi>RaddiÅ¿hes</hi> run up to <hi>Seed, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ReaÅ¿on which made me imagine this way of <hi>Pinching</hi> theÅ¿e two Å¿orts of <hi>Trees,</hi> and that makes me uÅ¿e it pretty often, is, that it being moÅ¿t certain that <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿eldom grows upon thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and commonly upon the weak ones, I thought, if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible to order Matters Å¿o, that the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is wholly employ'd in producing but one thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which proves either uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, or cumberÅ¿om; I Å¿ay, if it could be order'd Å¿o, that this <hi>Sap</hi> might be Å¿o divided as to produce Å¿everal <hi>Branches,</hi> there is no QueÅ¿tion to be made, but in the Quantity there would be Å¿ome weak ones, or perhaps many, which conÅ¿equently would be proper to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> inÅ¿tead of that, and, as we have already Å¿aid, the thick <hi>Branch</hi> would have produc'd no good Effect.</p>
                        <p>I have found the thing poÅ¿Å¿ible, and that it is requir'd, not only in <hi>May,</hi> but Å¿ometimes in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> to break the thick new <hi>Shoots</hi> of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> while yet tender, and as eaÅ¿ie to break as GlaÅ¿s; which is moÅ¿t true.</p>
                        <p>This Operation is founded upon a ReaÅ¿on which I have explain'd in my Reflections, and therefore is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary here.</p>
                        <p>Having then, at the time heretofore mention'd, broken Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e thick new <hi>Shoots</hi> within two or three <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> I have often obtain'd what I deÅ¿ir'd by it, that is, as many <hi>Branches</hi> as I had left <hi>Eyes;</hi> and, indeed, a vigorous <hi>Tree</hi> cannot have too many,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48210:162"/>
provided they be good, and well plac'd. Among the <hi>Branches</hi> proceeding from Å¿uch <hi>Pinching,</hi> if I may uÅ¿e the ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion, commonly Å¿ome have prov'd weak, and thoÅ¿e have born <hi>Fruit;</hi> Å¿ome have prov'd pretty Å¿trong, and have been <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood:</hi> If the <hi>Sap,</hi> which produc'd Å¿uch thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and form'd them with a lively, vigorous Action, met in its way an ObÅ¿tacle, to Å¿top it Å¿hort in the heighth of its Action, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently hindring it from following its CourÅ¿e in continuing to riÅ¿e, as it would do, not being hinder'd; in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, this <hi>Sap,</hi> which, in the mean time, cannot ceaÅ¿e acting, being forc'd to get out one way or other, would burÅ¿t out by as many Cranies, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as it would find near that place where it was Å¿top'd; or, upon neceÅ¿Å¿ity, would make Å¿ome of it Å¿elf.</p>
                        <p>But it muÅ¿t be noted, that this <hi>Pinching</hi> is Å¿eldom to be practis'd upon any but the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the Top, which would remain uÅ¿eleÅ¿s by their Situation, and yet would conÅ¿ume abundance of good <hi>Sap</hi> Å¿uperfluouÅ¿ly; and therefore it ought to be very Å¿eldom us'd upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the lower part, it being always very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve them until the Winter-<hi>Pruning,</hi> in order to their <hi>Å¿hooting</hi> Å¿ome others the following Year, Å¿it to fill Å¿uch places as naturally, and for the moÅ¿t part, are but too Å¿ubject to be thin.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e to be obÅ¿erv'd, that this <hi>Pinching,</hi> or Breaking off, muÅ¿t never be perform'd upon weak <hi>Branches;</hi> which, having no more <hi>Sap</hi> than they want, to be good, would only produce Å¿lender, <hi>SapleÅ¿s</hi> ones in that place, where the Å¿mall Portion of <hi>Sap</hi> which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allows them Å¿hould be divided.</p>
                        <p>And therefore nothing muÅ¿t be broken upon Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> as produce but too many of thoÅ¿e weak <hi>Branches,</hi> and few of thoÅ¿e good thick ones: There are Å¿ome of this Character to be found among all kind of <hi>Peach-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The beÅ¿t time for <hi>Pinching,</hi> particularly in cold Climes, like ours of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Neighbourhood of it, as we have already Å¿aid, is, at the End of <hi>May,</hi> and the Beginning of <hi>June;</hi> and when neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be perform'd a Å¿econd time, the time of the <hi>SolÅ¿tice,</hi> or longeÅ¿t Days of the Year, is admirable for it, as well as to <hi>Water</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Trees</hi> in a dry Soil, when <hi>Rain</hi> is wanting; at which time there is a wonderful re-doubling of Action in the <hi>Roots,</hi> and conÅ¿equently in the <hi>Branches;</hi> that being, indeed, the time of the greateÅ¿t Effort of all the Spring.</p>
                        <p>We have already obÅ¿erv'd, that the firÅ¿t Fury of <hi>Stone-Fruits</hi> begins to appear at the Full-Moon of <hi>April,</hi> which commonly falls out in <hi>May;</hi> and we are going to Å¿ee another kind of Fury at the FirÅ¿t Quarter of the Moon of the Å¿aid Month of <hi>May;</hi> both which times are good for <hi>Pinching:</hi> And, indeed, we obÅ¿erve, that all the <hi>Branches</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> do not begin to <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> vigorouÅ¿ly at the Å¿ame time; Å¿o that what has not been <hi>Pinch'd</hi> or broken off at the firÅ¿t SeaÅ¿on, may be done at the Å¿econd.</p>
                        <p>I have Å¿aid, that the beÅ¿t time to <hi>Pinch</hi> the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> was, at the time they are eaÅ¿ie to break at the leaÅ¿t pull, without being oblig'd to uÅ¿e a <hi>Knife</hi> to Å¿horten them: From thence it is eaÅ¿ie to judge, that I have found it dangerous to uÅ¿e In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments to cut Å¿uch <hi>Branches,</hi> which is true; for, as I have Å¿aid heretofore, the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or End of Å¿uch <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿o cut, is apt to blacken and die, it certainly not producing the Å¿ame Effect with that which proceeds from the Action of <hi>Pinching.</hi> The Å¿ame thing may be Å¿aid of the thick, tender <hi>Branches,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Graff's</hi> of <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> made upon a thick, vigorous <hi>Stock;</hi> however, Experience teaches us, that the <hi>Knife</hi> is not Å¿o dangerous upon theÅ¿e, as upon thoÅ¿e of <hi>Peach-Trees.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>As to the very vigorous <hi>Tree,</hi> particularly in queÅ¿tion here, many People propoÅ¿e, as Å¿overaign and infallible, abundance of Expedients and Remedies, which I have tried a long while, with great Application; yet, upon my Word, without the leaÅ¿t SucceÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48210:162"/>
To bore a Hole through the <hi>Stem</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> and put a Peg of dry Oak into it; to Å¿plit one of the main <hi>Roots,</hi> and put a Stone into it; to <hi>Prune</hi> at the time of the Declinings of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are wretched Secrets of good old People, infatuated with old Maxims; People who have but little Skill in Vegetation, and are eaÅ¿ily Å¿atisfy'd.</p>
                        <p>For my part, beÅ¿ides my being perÅ¿uaded by Experience, that my manner of <hi>Pruning</hi> often prevents the Difficulty now in queÅ¿tion, I have moreover, in caÅ¿e of great ObÅ¿tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, recourÅ¿e to what I have Å¿aid elÅ¿ewhere, it being really the beÅ¿t thing that can be done; which is, that, as conÅ¿tantly the <hi>Fruit</hi> on <hi>Trees,</hi> is only an Effect, or, at leaÅ¿t, a Mark of a certain moderate WeakneÅ¿s, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, without minding a thouÅ¿and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, to go to the Source of the Vigour of the <hi>Tree,</hi> that is, to the <hi>Roots,</hi> uncovering half of them, and cutting off one, two, or three of the thickeÅ¿t on that Å¿ide, and conÅ¿equently the moÅ¿t active; inÅ¿omuch that the leaÅ¿t part of them may not remain, to be capable of acting, or producing the leaÅ¿t <hi>Thread</hi> of a capilar <hi>Root:</hi> The <hi>Roots</hi> of the other Moity, (for I Å¿uppoÅ¿e there may be good ones; otherwiÅ¿e, Å¿o many muÅ¿t not be taken away from the Side uncovered;) the <hi>Roots,</hi> I Å¿ay, of the other Moity, left untouch'd, will be Å¿ufficient to nouriÅ¿h the whole <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Remedy is infallible to prevent Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> from being, as it were, reÅ¿ty to our Cares and InduÅ¿try, and will Å¿oon make them produce <hi>Fruit;</hi> by reaÅ¿on that this will put a Å¿top to the Production of the <hi>Sap,</hi> Å¿o that it Å¿hall not be Å¿o abounding as before, one, two, or three of the chief Workers being remov'd; and thus the weak <hi>Branches</hi> will only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a moderate NouriÅ¿hment, and the <hi>Buds</hi> begun, inÅ¿tead of extending, will grow round, and conÅ¿equently turn to <hi>Fruit-Buds,</hi> will <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> and finally yield what is deÅ¿ired of them.</p>
                        <p>PhiloÅ¿ophers may CriticiÅ¿e upon, and explain this as they pleaÅ¿e; but Å¿till it is moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the thing happens as I have Å¿aid.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>Root</hi> up Å¿uch <hi>Trees,</hi> and re-plant them immediately, with the main part of their <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> either in the Å¿ame place, or in another, as Å¿ome Authors propoÅ¿e it, is Å¿ometimes an effectual Remedy; but it Å¿eems to me Å¿omewhat too violent, Å¿ince Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it threatens Death, and often makes an ugly <hi>Tree,</hi> which, in my Opinion, is as great a Defect as the other; for which reaÅ¿on I uÅ¿e it but Å¿eldom, though Å¿ometimes I do.</p>

                           <p>Of the Conduct, or Culture of <hi>Fig-Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFter having Å¿aid in another place, and that after a long Experience, that a ripe <hi>Fig,</hi> according to my Pallat, is the beÅ¿t of all the <hi>Fruits</hi> growing upon <hi>Trees,</hi> that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have met with; and, indeed, is look'd upon as being the moÅ¿t delicious, by all judicious PerÅ¿ons; I thought my Å¿elf oblig'd, in this general TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Fruits,</hi> to make a particular one for the <hi>Conduct</hi> of this.</p>
                        <p>Before I enter upon this matter, I cannot forbear expreÅ¿Å¿ing my AÅ¿toniÅ¿hment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idering that notwithÅ¿tanding the Å¿ingular EÅ¿teem moÅ¿t People have for good <hi>Figs,</hi> it was a general CuÅ¿tom in this Country to have but a very Å¿mall quantity of them in each <hi>Garden,</hi> not exceeding two or three at moÅ¿t, and even thoÅ¿e commonly abandon'd in Å¿ome inner <hi>Yard,</hi> expos'd to all manner of ill Treatment, without the leaÅ¿t <hi>Culture.</hi> Indeed, in warmer Climates they are better, and more honourably treated; there are always abundance of them, not only in <hi>Gardens,</hi> and under the Å¿helter of a HouÅ¿e, but particularly in <hi>Vine-yards,</hi> in <hi>Hedges,</hi> and in the open <hi>Fields;</hi> and they make a conÅ¿iderable Trade of thoÅ¿e that are preÅ¿erv'd, and dry'd, which I do not mention here.</p>
                        <p>I am Å¿enÅ¿ible, that the difficulty of preÅ¿erving <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> from the great Colds of the Winter, is the chief ReaÅ¿on for which we have Å¿o few of them in our Climates; but yet, conÅ¿idering the ConÅ¿equence and Merit of their <hi>Fruit,</hi> in my Opinion, People Å¿hould have made it their Study, a little more than they have done, to enjoy, to a higher degree, that rich PreÅ¿ent of Nature.</p>
                        <p>It is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary to repeat here what I have Å¿aid at large in the TreatiÅ¿e of the Choice and Proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> touching the DiverÅ¿ity of the Kinds of <hi>Figs,</hi> nor of my prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the white ones, whether long, or round, for this Country, to all the others: Neither will I repeat what I have Å¿aid, as to the Situation which is moÅ¿t proper for them.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hall only relate the manner of my <hi>Cultivating</hi> of them; and eÅ¿pecially, how that, notwithÅ¿tanding the ill CuÅ¿tom, which made us be Å¿atisfy'd with a few of them, I have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48210:163"/>
apply'd my Å¿elf to the breeding of many; and that not only by the common Way of <hi>Planting</hi> them in <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> or againÅ¿t Walls, but alÅ¿o in an extraordinary manner, that is, in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> which is both pretty new, pleaÅ¿ant and uÅ¿eful; which, if I may be allow'd to introduce a new ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion, may be call'd a <hi>Figuerie,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Orangeries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Delight His MajeÅ¿ty takes in that <hi>Fruit,</hi> and the danger of Dying, to which all <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are expos'd in the open <hi>Ground,</hi> in great FroÅ¿ts, or, at leaÅ¿t, of bearing no <hi>Fruit</hi> that Year, have been two powerful Motives for me, who am honour'd with the Place of Director of all the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> belonging to the Royal Family, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to bethink my Å¿elf of the Means of Certainly having a great many <hi>Figs</hi> every Year.</p>
                        <p>In the performance of which, I have met with very little difficulty; for, in the firÅ¿t place, the common <hi>Mould</hi> of every <hi>Garden,</hi> mix'd with an equal quantity of <hi>Soil</hi> or Å¿mall <hi>Dung,</hi> turn'd to <hi>Mould,</hi> is extraordinary good for it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> inÅ¿tead of being hard and thick, like thoÅ¿e of other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Kernel,</hi> on the contrary, remain Å¿oft and flexible, and commonly Å¿lender, and Å¿o are eaÅ¿ily order'd in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and even with more caÅ¿e than thoÅ¿e of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which thrive Å¿o well in them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> TheÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees</hi> naturally produce abundance of <hi>Roots;</hi> Å¿o that it is very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie for them to live fatly and vigorouÅ¿ly in a Å¿mall quantity or Å¿pace of <hi>Ground,</hi> provided MoiÅ¿ture be not wanting. BeÅ¿ides, the univerÅ¿al Approbation I have met with in this Undertaking, and the Imitation that has follow'd it by many of the Curious, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd me to make a conÅ¿iderable progreÅ¿s in this <hi>Figuerie,</hi> or <hi>Fig-Garden;</hi> and that which has moÅ¿t induc'd me to proceed in it, is, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> ripens a great deal Å¿ooner here than in the main <hi>Ground,</hi> and is Å¿omewhat better, and yellower, the <hi>Earth</hi> which is eaÅ¿ily heated in the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> producing the firÅ¿t good Effect, and the open Air the two others.</p>
                        <p>To which I might add, the pleaÅ¿ure of Å¿eeing in this Country abundance of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in the open Air, (which Å¿eem'd to be altogether reÅ¿erv'd for hot Countries,) and that of being, in the Summer, in the middle of a <hi>Wood,</hi> abounding with <hi>Figs;</hi> there to chuÅ¿e and gather the Å¿ineÅ¿t and ripeÅ¿t, without any trouble.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I have bred abundance of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> having found that, beÅ¿ides the Advantages above related, there was yet another which is very conÅ¿iderable; and that is, that, to preÅ¿erve them Å¿ecurely, and with EaÅ¿e, in the Winter, an ordinary Covering to keep off the great FroÅ¿t is Å¿ufficient, that Covering or Shelter not being near Å¿o conÅ¿iderable as thoÅ¿e for <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> and <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿emins,</hi> theÅ¿e both Å¿tripping or caÅ¿ting their <hi>Leaves</hi> at the leaÅ¿t Cold, by which they are almoÅ¿t utterly Å¿poil'd; every body knowing, that a Fall of <hi>Leaves,</hi> proceeding from the Rigour of Cold, or too much MoiÅ¿ture, denotes, in thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> at leaÅ¿t, a great Infirmity in the <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿o Å¿tripp'd, inÅ¿omuch that it is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to recover them; whereas we have no <hi>Leaves</hi> to preÅ¿erve on our <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> it is only <hi>Wood,</hi> I mean <hi>Branches,</hi> of which the <hi>Wood</hi> is pretty courÅ¿e, though extreamly <hi>Pithy,</hi> or <hi>Sappy;</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that it reÅ¿iÅ¿ts the Cold much better than <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> it being certain that this <hi>Wood,</hi> which of it Å¿elf is pretty tender, notwithÅ¿tanding, dries up at the uÅ¿ual Fall of the Leaves, and conÅ¿equently grows hard; the reaÅ¿on of which is, that the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ceaÅ¿ing to act within, from the time the <hi>Leaves</hi> begin to fall on the out-Å¿ide, the <hi>Wood</hi> no longer receiving any new <hi>Sap,</hi> ceaÅ¿es to fear the Rigour of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on; whereas the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> and <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿amins,</hi> by the perpetual Operation of their <hi>Roots,</hi> remains as tender in the Winter as it is all the reÅ¿t of the Year: Which is the reaÅ¿on that, as the <hi>Sap</hi> continually riÅ¿es, particularly for the NouriÅ¿hment of thoÅ¿e <hi>Leaves</hi> that remain upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> as well as for the NouriÅ¿hment of the <hi>Branches</hi> themÅ¿elves; that <hi>Sap,</hi> at that time, as it were, keeps both the one and the other Å¿o Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible to FroÅ¿t and MoiÅ¿ture, that thereby they often fall into thoÅ¿e great DiÅ¿orders, known by every body, which are almoÅ¿t the greateÅ¿t they are liable to.</p>
                        <p>It being then granted, that, for the preÅ¿ervation of our <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> it is Å¿ufficient that the great FroÅ¿t Å¿hould not light directly upon their <hi>Branches,</hi> it follows from thence, that it is Å¿ufficient for the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory</hi> to be reaÅ¿onably cloÅ¿e, as well at the top, as at the Doors and Windows; inÅ¿omuch that the <hi>Ground</hi> may have been pretty well frozen in the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and yet the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> receive no prejudice by it: So that a moderate low Cellar, or a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or a Common-Hall, which would be Å¿o pernicious to <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> and <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿emins,</hi> may not be amiÅ¿s for our <hi>Fig-Trees;</hi> not but if that place were very moiÅ¿t, it might harm them: As alÅ¿o a <hi>Cas'd Fig-Tree,</hi> remaining in the Winter without a Covering, would be much more endanger'd than another in the main <hi>Ground;</hi> for a thick FroÅ¿t would kill the <hi>Roots,</hi> as well as the Head; whereas a <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> planted in open <hi>Ground,</hi> would, at leaÅ¿t, be preÅ¿erv'd towards the <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Time of putting <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatories,</hi> is the Month of <hi>November;</hi> that is, they muÅ¿t be plac'd there as Å¿oon as the thick or great FroÅ¿ts are coming on, there to re|

without wanting the leaÅ¿t Culture, or any Care, beÅ¿ides the keeping of the place as cloÅ¿e as can be, and that only during the great Colds; for, excepting that time, they need not be kept Å¿o cloÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> They may be taken out again about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> and Å¿ometimes at the very beginning, the Weather being very fair, and the SeaÅ¿ons of great FroÅ¿ts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Å¿ome manner, paÅ¿t: There is no need of Å¿taying, till there is nothing at all to fear, for the new <hi>Figs;</hi> for then there would be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿taying until the end of <hi>April;</hi> it happening pretty often, that, until that time, there are certain FroÅ¿ts, which blacken and kill them, though reaÅ¿onably thick. The reaÅ¿on which obliges to take them out Å¿ooner, is, that it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Å¿hould immediately enjoy the Rays of the Sun, and Å¿ome Å¿oft Showers of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> in order to be able to <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> their firÅ¿t <hi>Fruit</hi> with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, to the end, above all things, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> may inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly be us'd to the open Air; which muÅ¿t make them grow, and ripen betimes; it being moÅ¿t certain, that the <hi>Figs</hi> which grow under Covert, coming into the open Air, are apt to blacken, and Å¿o periÅ¿h, even without any FroÅ¿t, or conÅ¿iderable Cold; a North-EaÅ¿t Wind, or exceÅ¿Å¿ive Heat, in the firÅ¿t Days of their coming out, deÅ¿troying them without Redemption: Whereas thoÅ¿e <hi>Figs</hi> that have been a little enur'd to the Air, have harden'd themÅ¿elves Å¿o, as to be able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t, notwithÅ¿tanding the Intemperature of the SeaÅ¿on.</p>
                        <p>In taking the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> out of the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> at the time prefix'd, there are only two things to be done: The firÅ¿t is, to put them immediately along, and as cloÅ¿e as can be to Å¿ome good Walls, expos'd to the South or EaÅ¿t; and there leave them, until the Full-Moon of <hi>April</hi> be paÅ¿t, which is about the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> This Å¿ituation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them, to enjoy the AÅ¿pect of the Father of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and be Å¿oak'd by the Rains of the Spring, as well as to find Å¿ome Shelter againÅ¿t the Morning-FroÅ¿ts of the Remains of Winter, which are thoÅ¿e of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> becauÅ¿e that, whereas this wonderful <hi>Fruit Å¿hoots</hi> out at that time, ready form'd, from the Body of the <hi>Branch;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enting it Å¿elf thus, all on the Å¿udden, without the help of any Covering, or being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> or <hi>Leaves,</hi> it muÅ¿t needs be very tender in the firÅ¿t Days of its Birth; and therefore Å¿uch FroÅ¿ts, which are very common and frequent at thoÅ¿e times, falling then upon them, would prove very dangerous, or rather mortal; inÅ¿omuch that, though this Shelter be favourable to <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> both to Å¿uch that are <hi>planted</hi> in the <hi>Ground,</hi> as well as to thoÅ¿e that are in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> yet, notwithÅ¿tanding, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to cover them with Sheets, or Straw, or long dry Dung, or <hi>Peas-Cods,</hi> when-ever they Å¿eem to be threaten'd by Å¿ome FroÅ¿t: The cold North-WeÅ¿t Winds, North, and North-EaÅ¿t, or Å¿ome Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>The Å¿econd thing that is to be done, after having remov'd <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> out of the <hi>ConÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory,</hi> and having thus plac'd them under Å¿helter, is, (to uÅ¿e the PhraÅ¿e of <hi>Gard'ners)</hi> to give them a good Wetting in every <hi>CaÅ¿e;</hi> which is, one good Å¿ubÅ¿tantial Wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; inÅ¿omuch that all the Moat may be Å¿oak'd by it; and there Å¿hall hardly need any more <hi>Watering,</hi> until, with Å¿ome <hi>Leaves,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> begins to appear all together, and even a little thick, which is about the middle of <hi>April;</hi> the Spring-Rains will Å¿upply other <hi>Waterings,</hi> but this firÅ¿t <hi>Watering</hi> is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary, to Å¿oak the <hi>Ground</hi> a-new, which, after four or five Months Confinement, was grown quite dry; otherwiÅ¿e the <hi>Roots,</hi> at the coming in of the hot Weather, Å¿hould not be capable, for want of MoiÅ¿ture, to renew their Action; and conÅ¿equently, there Å¿hould be no good Motion of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> either to nouriÅ¿h and thicken that new <hi>Fruit</hi> the Å¿ooner, or to afford us the Å¿ooner <hi>Leaves,</hi> and new <hi>Wood;</hi> with a Certainty, that the Å¿ooner <hi>Fig-Trees Å¿hoot</hi> in the Spring, the Å¿ooner we Å¿hall have the Å¿econd <hi>Figs</hi> of Autumn. I will take notice by the by here, that the firÅ¿t <hi>Figs</hi> grow independently from the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> juÅ¿t as the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> of other <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> open; and produce their firÅ¿t <hi>Buds</hi> independently, from the Action of their <hi>Roots.</hi>

But, before I come to this, in order to gain Time, and to get with eaÅ¿e a great many <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> for the EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment and Maintenance of my <hi>Fig-Garden,</hi> I begin by making, towards the middle of <hi>March,</hi> an ordinary <hi>Bed,</hi> or <hi>Colich,</hi> of good <hi>Dung,</hi> of about three Foot high, in proportion to four or five Foot in Breadth, and as much in Length as my Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion requires: I let the great Heat of it paÅ¿s, which commonly laÅ¿ts five or Å¿ix Days; after which, having provided <hi>Earthen Pots</hi> about five or Å¿ix Inches Diameter, or Å¿mall <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> about Å¿even or eight: I fill thoÅ¿e <hi>Pots,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> with the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Garden,</hi> mix'd, as I have Å¿aid, with an equal quantity of <hi>Soil</hi> or Å¿mall, old, conÅ¿ummated <hi>Dung,</hi> or with nothing elÅ¿e; that <hi>Soil</hi> being very good for the firÅ¿t Multiplication of <hi>Roots,</hi> but would not be Å¿o good for the other <hi>CaÅ¿ings.</hi> Care muÅ¿t be taken to preÅ¿s that <hi>Earth</hi> very cloÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of the <hi>Pot,</hi> as well as in the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿e;</hi> it will Å¿uffice to have two or three Inches looÅ¿e on the top.</p>
                        <p>After this, I take Å¿mall <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> altogether <hi>Rooted,</hi> and after having extreamly Å¿hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd all their <hi>Roots,</hi> I put them, about three or four Inehes deep, into the Å¿aid <hi>Pots,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> allowing each but about four or five Inches <hi>Stem: (Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> cannot be too Å¿hort body'd:) Afterwards I put the Å¿aid <hi>Pots,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> up to the Middle in the aforeÅ¿aid <hi>Bed.</hi> A conÅ¿iderable part of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> Å¿o <hi>Planted,</hi> commonly take, and produce, that very Year, Å¿ome pretty fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> and in a pretty good number; provided, as is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary, they be well <hi>Water'd</hi> during the Summer, and that the <hi>Bed</hi> has been heated twice or thrice on the Å¿ides, to keep it always reaÅ¿onably hot.</p>
                        <p>When I make uÅ¿e of <hi>Pots,</hi> I take out of the <hi>Pots,</hi> that very Summer, or, at leaÅ¿t, in Autumn, or the following Spring, thoÅ¿e little <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> that have <hi>Å¿hot</hi> well in thoÅ¿e <hi>Pots,</hi> to put them together, with the Mote into <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> of about Å¿even or eight Inches, fill'd up with the prepar'd <hi>Earth;</hi> which, above all, as I have already Å¿aid, muÅ¿t have been preÅ¿s'd cloÅ¿e into the bottom, to hinder that Mote, and the new <hi>Roots</hi> that Å¿hall grow, from deÅ¿cending too Å¿oon, and too eaÅ¿ily, into that Bottom; and to do it yet more effectually, in <hi>CaÅ¿ing</hi> of them, I obÅ¿erve the Å¿ame Method as in <hi>CaÅ¿ing</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> excepting only <hi>RubbiÅ¿h,</hi> and pieces of old and dry <hi>PlaiÅ¿ter,</hi> which are no wiÅ¿e neceÅ¿Å¿ary here; that is, I <hi>Plant</hi> theÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in Å¿uch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Superficies of the Mote, may exceed the Edge of the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> about two or three Inches; and, with <hi>Douves</hi> put on the Å¿ides, I keep in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> of the <hi>Waterings,</hi> Å¿o that none of it can be waÅ¿ted; the weight of the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> together with the moving or tranÅ¿porting of the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Å¿o <hi>CaÅ¿ed</hi> Å¿inking the Surface but too Å¿oon.</p>
                        <p>Great Care being taken to <hi>Water</hi> thoÅ¿e young <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> in thoÅ¿e little <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin pretty often to produce <hi>Fruit</hi> in them the very Year of their being <hi>Cas'd;</hi> at leaÅ¿t, they are in a Condition to produce Å¿ome the following Years. They muÅ¿t be kept two Years in thoÅ¿e kind of little <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> in order to be put next into larger, of about thirteen or fourteen Inches in the in-Å¿ide; in order to which, two thirds of the Mote, muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be taken away, <hi>Planting</hi> them eÅ¿pecially, as I have already Å¿aid, a little high, and preÅ¿Å¿ing the <hi>Ground,</hi> as cloÅ¿e as can be, into the Bottom: Which things muÅ¿t all be done of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, at every Removal out of the <hi>CaÅ¿es.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are to remain in theÅ¿e, until there be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of changing them a-new: which muÅ¿t be done as Å¿oon as the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are obÅ¿erv'd to <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> no more thick <hi>Wood,</hi> which commonly happens at the end of the third or fourth Year after their being <hi>Cas'd:</hi> At which time they muÅ¿t be taken out of thoÅ¿e <hi>CheÅ¿ts,</hi> and, after having perform'd the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations heretofore explain'd, put again either into the Å¿ame <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> if, after having Å¿erv'd three or four Years, they are Å¿till good enough; which happens but Å¿eldom, the great <hi>Waterings</hi> rotting many of them; or into other new <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> of the Å¿ame Size.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be left three or four Years longer in thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> being about thirteen or fourteen Inches in the in-Å¿ide; and afterwards, as Å¿oon as it is obÅ¿ervable, by the Marks above explain'd, that there is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of changing them, the Å¿ame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as before muÅ¿t be us'd, to put them into other <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> of Å¿eventeen or eighteen Inches; in which they muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be preÅ¿erv'd for the Å¿pace of three or four Years; at the end of which, they muÅ¿t be remov'd again, for the fourth time, in the manner aforeÅ¿aid, either into the Å¿ame <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> or into others of the Å¿ame Size.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty of TranÅ¿portation commonly hinders me, after the wearing out of theÅ¿e Å¿econd <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> of eighteen Inches, from venturing to put them into larger; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding, would be very proper for them, being about twenty one or twenty two Inches, which, however, Å¿hould be the laÅ¿t I would remove them into, unleÅ¿s I had very great Conveniencies, both for the TranÅ¿porting of them, and for the Laying of them up.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48210:164"/>
And whereas, at length, thoÅ¿e CaÅ¿ed <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> would grow to Å¿uch a degree of largeneÅ¿s and weight, as would require too many Machines to move them, and even too great a quantity of <hi>Water</hi> to give them due <hi>Waterings,</hi> I abandon them, after having <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated</hi> them for the Å¿pace of fifteen or twenty Years; and take no farther Care of them, than to <hi>Plant</hi> them, either into our own <hi>Gardens,</hi> or in Å¿ome of our Friends; for which they are yet good enough, provided Care be taken to cut off a conÅ¿iderable part of their <hi>Wood,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the main part of their <hi>Roots;</hi> or elÅ¿e, with a great deal of Regret, I reÅ¿olve to burn them. But, in the mean time, in order to have my <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> and my <hi>Fig-Garden,</hi> always equally fill'd, I yearly rear up new ones, in the manner aforeÅ¿aid; which Å¿erve to fill up the room of the old ones I have been oblig'd to part with.</p>
                        <p>The beÅ¿t of it is, that the Breeding of them is eaÅ¿ie: FirÅ¿t, BecauÅ¿e the <hi>Feet</hi> of the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> that are <hi>Planted</hi> in the main <hi>Ground Å¿hoot</hi> abundance of <hi>Rooted Suckers.</hi> Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it is very eaÅ¿ie to lay <hi>Branches</hi> into the <hi>Ground,</hi> round about every old <hi>Foot,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their taking <hi>Root.</hi> And Finally, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome may be bred by means of bended <hi>Layers,</hi> plac'd a little in the Shade, it is good to make a little GaÅ¿h in thoÅ¿e towards the Extremity, though many Å¿ucceed without it.</p>
                        <p>Thus there are abundance of Means, and all very eaÅ¿ie, in order to make a pretty good ProviÅ¿ion of Å¿mall young <hi>Fig-Trees:</hi> Wo to that <hi>Gard'ner</hi> who does not do it, and does not uÅ¿e his utmoÅ¿t Skill to multiply Å¿o good a <hi>Tree;</hi> trying immediately, whenever he is oblig'd to cut Å¿ome <hi>Fig-Branches,</hi> to make thoÅ¿e <hi>Layers</hi> take <hi>Root;</hi> at he may do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it has a little <hi>Wood</hi> of two Years Å¿tanding; becauÅ¿e that thoÅ¿e cut <hi>Branches</hi> that are but of a Years Å¿tanding, are much apter to rot, than to take <hi>Root.</hi>

                        <p>The greateÅ¿t Inconveniency attending <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> is that which I have mention'd hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which is, that, during the Months of <hi>June, July, AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> there is an indiÅ¿penÅ¿ible neceÅ¿Å¿ity of <hi>Watering</hi> them largely every Day, inÅ¿omuch that the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> may penetrate through the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿e;</hi> at leaÅ¿t, without fail, they muÅ¿t be <hi>Water'd</hi> Å¿o every other Day, unleÅ¿s it <hi>Rains</hi> very hard; not that the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Rains</hi> often penetrates the Body of the <hi>Mote;</hi> but, becauÅ¿e while it <hi>Rains,</hi> there is no <hi>Sun-Å¿hine</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of penetrating through the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> to dry up the <hi>Roots;</hi> which is the only ReaÅ¿on that may Å¿top the Continuation of <hi>Watering.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither muÅ¿t Å¿mall <hi>Rains</hi> be minded, they are of no uÅ¿e to <hi>Fig-Trees;</hi> on the contrary, often prejudice them, by perÅ¿uading the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> they are Å¿ufficient to Å¿upply the want of <hi>Watering,</hi> which they are not; the broad <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> hindering the <hi>Earth</hi> (which lies very cloÅ¿e in the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> and is very hard by an Infinity of <hi>Roots)</hi> from being Å¿oak'd by an inconÅ¿iderable <hi>Rain,</hi> Å¿ince even great <hi>Showers</hi> cannot do it.</p>
                        <p>It is moÅ¿t certain that the <hi>Fruit</hi> is in danger of dropping down, and periÅ¿hing, the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ceaÅ¿ing never Å¿o little to act, for want of MoiÅ¿ture, and to furniÅ¿h the <hi>Figs</hi> with the perpetual help they Å¿tand indiÅ¿penÅ¿ibly in need of; which will certainly happen, upon failure of the great and frequent <hi>Waterings</hi> we recommend: For thoÅ¿e <hi>Figs</hi> that have wanted the leaÅ¿t NouriÅ¿hment, remain flobby, and, as it were, full of Wind, inÅ¿tead of being fill'd up with a good pithy <hi>Pulp;</hi> and Å¿o, inÅ¿tead of <hi>Ripening,</hi> drop down; which is the greateÅ¿t Inconvenience that can be fear'd; and conÅ¿equently, this requires Å¿o great an Application, that it is no eaÅ¿ie matter to Å¿ucceed in <hi>Fig-Gardens.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Planted in the main <hi>Ground</hi> requires no Å¿uch Slavery; Å¿ince Å¿uch as are <hi>Planted</hi> even in very dry <hi>Soils</hi> commonly produce Fine Large Good <hi>Figs;</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> which have the liberty of extending round about, tho' the Earth be never Å¿o parch'd, Å¿till find wherewithal to perform their Function and Duty: and in imitation of thoÅ¿e, when the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of CaÅ¿es touch the <hi>Ground,</hi> commonly Å¿ome <hi>Roots</hi> get out of it, which take into that very Ground, and there multiply to that degree, that they are able to live without frequent Waterings: But then they are liable to other Inconveniencies, which I Å¿hall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>There now remains to Å¿peak of the <hi>Pruning</hi> and <hi>Pinching</hi> or <hi>Breaking,</hi> which I Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> either Planted in the main Ground, or in CaÅ¿es; both for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Fine <hi>Trees,</hi> according to the Beauty proper to thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> as well as to make them Å¿hoot the <hi>Figs</hi> the Å¿ooner, every one in their SeaÅ¿on; that is, not only the firÅ¿t, which are call'd <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om-Figs,</hi> but alÅ¿o the Å¿econd, call'd <hi>Autumn,</hi> or <hi>Second-Figs,</hi> and <hi>Figs</hi> of the Å¿econd <hi>Sap,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>As to the Beauty proper to <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in CaÅ¿es, it is not to be expected that it can be Å¿o regular as that of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that are likewiÅ¿e in CaÅ¿es; neither can the Beauty of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> or againÅ¿t a <hi>Wall,</hi> be expected Å¿o perfect as that of <hi>Dwarf-Pear-Trees,</hi> or other <hi>Wall-Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have Å¿ufficiently explain'd thoÅ¿e kind of Beauties, each in particular, in <hi>TreatiÅ¿es</hi> written upon that Subject, without repeating it here: It will Å¿uffice to Å¿ay, That the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48210:165"/>
Beauty of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in CaÅ¿es, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts chiefly in being real <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> without having any <hi>Stem</hi> if poÅ¿Å¿ible; and laÅ¿tly, in not Shooting too high, or being too much Extended, and open, with great bare <hi>Branches,</hi> which is but too common in thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> unleÅ¿s an extraordinary Care be taken of them.</p>
                        <p>There is no great neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿aying, that at the end of Winter, or at the beginning of the Spring, it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to <hi>Trim</hi> or <hi>Pluck off</hi> all the Dead <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> either in the main ground, or in CaÅ¿es, no body being ignorant of it: ThoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees</hi> having very <hi>Pithy</hi> or <hi>Sappy Branches,</hi> are liable to have a great many of them Å¿poyl'd, tho' the Cold be never Å¿o moderate. We have often Experienc'd it, particularly in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of 1675. in which there was not half an inch of Ice in any part, and yet a conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of <hi>Fig-Tree Branches</hi> periÅ¿h'd; as if the abÅ¿ence of heat alone was capable to deÅ¿troy them; conÅ¿equently, a far greater quantity muÅ¿t periÅ¿h in long hard Winters, as we had in 1670, and 1676. in which, the FroÅ¿t was Å¿o terrible, and our <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Å¿o much by it, that they were forc'd almoÅ¿t in all parts, to cut the thickeÅ¿t <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> within the very <hi>Foot,</hi> altho' they had been pretty well cover'd either with Straw, or dry Dung; even in Å¿o much, that the very Snow, which is a Soveraign Remedy for the PreÅ¿ervation of many young Tender <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>PeaÅ¿e, Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Lettuce,</hi> &amp;c. could not avail for the preÅ¿ervation of thoÅ¿e Well-belov'd unfortunate <hi>Fig-Trees;</hi> nay, rather Contributed to their deÅ¿truction.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that Å¿ome <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> tho' pretty Careful, have (notwithÅ¿tanding their Care) had the Ill luck to Å¿ee part of their <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> PeriÅ¿h, when no body could impute the leaÅ¿t fault to them, which was occaÅ¿ion'd by the Walls where thoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> were Planted, not being thick enough to hinder the rigour of the FroÅ¿t from penetrating through them; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are Planted againÅ¿t good Buildings, particularly, near Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, that are actually us'd, or at leaÅ¿t, againÅ¿t Walls about two foot thick, and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd: Happy likewiÅ¿e are thoÅ¿e who have them in dry Elevated Situations, and yet in a good Ground.</p>
                        <p>And ConÅ¿equently, unhappy all thoÅ¿e, who having none of theÅ¿e advantages, are expos'd to all that's pernicious for <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> as thin Walls to their <hi>Gardens,</hi> a Cold and MoiÅ¿t Soil, wanting both a favourable Climate, and Situation.</p>
                        <p>Since then <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are as difficult in the preÅ¿ervation, as their <hi>Fruit</hi> is Precious; let us give an exact Summary of what we think moÅ¿t proper, at leaÅ¿t to endeavour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of them as much as can be poÅ¿Å¿ible, from what is capable of deÅ¿troying of them.</p>
                        <p>The Inconveniencies wherewith they are threaten'd, do not hinder me, as I have already declar'd, in the <hi>TreatiÅ¿e</hi> of the Choice and Proportion of <hi>Fruit,</hi> from adviÅ¿ing every body to Plant a reaÅ¿onable quantity of them; I mean in the main Ground, having Å¿omewhat of the Situation that is proper for them, tho wanting Å¿ome of the Conditions that were to be wiÅ¿h'd for, for them.</p>
                        <p>Great Winters do not happen Å¿o often, as to diÅ¿courage us for ever from having Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> which produce Å¿uch an Excellent <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The moÅ¿t material thing in this CaÅ¿e for the Culture, is firÅ¿t, during the Summer, and Autumn, to give their <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿ome liberty, the <hi>Fruits</hi> growing better, and more eaÅ¿ily upon them: They muÅ¿t neither be ConÅ¿train'd, nor PalliÅ¿ado'd, or tack'd like the <hi>Branches</hi> of other <hi>Wall-Fruit-Trees;</hi> it will Å¿uffice to uphold them before with Å¿ome Pearches barely plac'd upon great Hooks driven into the Walls, Å¿o as to be at three foot diÅ¿tance from each other; and that beginning from the bottom, there may be a Row within a foot of the Ground, Checker-wiÅ¿e: ThoÅ¿e Hooks muÅ¿t be four Inches into the Wall, and about eight on the outÅ¿ide, made, as it appears in the Figure.</p>

no part may remain bare, and expos'd to the weather. BeÅ¿ides all which, another parcel of the Å¿ame long Dung muÅ¿t be kept ready near the <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> to double the Coverings if need be, one Å¿ingle Night being Å¿ufficient to ruine all. North EaÅ¿t Winds, as we had them in the Winter 1676. and the South Winds, like unto thoÅ¿e of the Winter 1670. are likewiÅ¿e Å¿ometimes Mortal for <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> and commonly more than full North, Å¿o that a guard muÅ¿t be kept equally againÅ¿t them all.</p>
                        <p>Whenever then any body deÅ¿igns to have <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> they muÅ¿t be prepar'd to take all the Care we have mention'd, as neceÅ¿Å¿ary for their PreÅ¿ervation: But when, notwithÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, Å¿ome prove Å¿o unfortunate as not to Å¿ucceed, which without doubt will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but Å¿eldom, provided the Walls they Å¿tand againÅ¿t, are condition'd as aforeÅ¿aid: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I Å¿ay, this Å¿hould happen, in my Opinion it ought not to trouble one, Å¿ince nothing has been wanting that lay in the Power of Man.</p>
                        <p>The Winter being paÅ¿t, and even the Month of <hi>March</hi> almoÅ¿t quite Å¿pent, if the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Å¿tand againÅ¿t the Wall, only half their Covering muÅ¿t be taken away, eÅ¿pecially that part the Winter may have Å¿poyl'd or rotten, and leave the <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿till fix'd thus to the Wall, at leaÅ¿t always half cover'd, without altering any thing about them, until the Full Moon of <hi>April;</hi> provided always, that if the Full Moon of <hi>March,</hi> which happens in the PaÅ¿Å¿ion-Week, Å¿eems to threaten Å¿ome FroÅ¿t, as it often does, you muÅ¿t not fail at the leaÅ¿t Å¿ignal of it to redouble the Coverings immediately, there to leave them until the Weather appear more certain, and the <hi>Figs</hi> are grown to the bigneÅ¿s of a Large Pea; which in our Climates Å¿eldom happens until the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> for as we have already Å¿aid, the main part of the great Colds Å¿eldom leave us 'till then: At which time it will be proper to put Å¿ome Å¿mall <hi>Branches,</hi> heretofore ty'd and conÅ¿train'd, at liberty; but yet, as I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e Å¿aid, not without propping them with Pearches croÅ¿swiÅ¿e, to hinder them from falling too much forward: This, in my Opinion, is a Å¿ufficient Å¿tay, thoÅ¿e Pearches put upon Hooks Å¿upporting the <hi>Branches</hi> very well, and hindering them, not only from falling, but alÅ¿o from breaking, and being ruffled by the Wind, and the <hi>Fruit</hi> is thereby preÅ¿erv'd Å¿ound and intire.</p>
                        <p>I muÅ¿t farther add, that Large Sheets are proper enough to cover (during dangerous or Å¿uÅ¿pected Nights) <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> being near the Wall, either Planted there, or in CaÅ¿es; to which end they muÅ¿t be faÅ¿ten'd to the Pearches, like Sails to MaÅ¿ts, and beÅ¿ides, put other long Perches almoÅ¿t Å¿traight over the <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> to hinder the Sheets being agitated by the Winds, from touching the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the rubbing of the Sheets againÅ¿t them never failing to Å¿poyl them; Å¿o that it will likewiÅ¿e be convenient to tie thoÅ¿e Sheets near the Ground, by means of Å¿ome Hooks that may hinder them from Å¿uch Agitations.</p>
                        <p>The third Material thing to be done for the Culture of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> is early to remove at the end of Winter, or even at the end of Autumn, the greateÅ¿t part of the <hi>Suckers</hi> or <hi>Layers</hi> they Å¿hoot from their <hi>Foot,</hi> without preÅ¿erving any, unleÅ¿s it be Å¿ome that may appear to be of uÅ¿e, either to fill up the Å¿ides, or to Å¿upply the room of Å¿uch as are dead, or dying: BeÅ¿ides, a good uÅ¿e will be made of thoÅ¿e <hi>Suckers,</hi> or <hi>Layers,</hi> Planting them in Å¿ome Trench made on purpoÅ¿e for it near Å¿ome good Wall; and whether there, or elÅ¿ewhere, Care muÅ¿t be taken to cover them Å¿o well, that the great Cold may not be able to Å¿poil them.</p>
                        <p>It is not leÅ¿s neceÅ¿Å¿ary to hinder as much as can be, thoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> from raiÅ¿ing Å¿oon to a great heighth, for Example, to two or three fathom, to the end, that keeping them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a moderate heighth, they may conÅ¿equently always remain full, and well furniÅ¿h'd, eÅ¿pecially, eaÅ¿ie to cover in the Winter time, which cannot be when they are too high: Therefore from year to year the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t Å¿eldom be allow'd more than a Foot, a Foot and a half, or two Foot at moÅ¿t, which is the only <hi>Pruning</hi> they require, after having, as we have already Å¿aid, clear'd them from all manner of dead <hi>Wood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> it is fit to break the end of the Extremety of every thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which may chance not to be above a Foot in length, provided the Winter has not already Å¿poil'd it, which happens commonly to Å¿uch as have only been finiÅ¿h'd a great way in Autumn, but Å¿eldom happens to Å¿uch as have been perfected betimes; however, that end which appears black, wrinkled, and dead, muÅ¿t be cut neatly.</p>
                        <p>This Method of <hi>Pinching</hi> or <hi>Pruning,</hi> Å¿erves to make Å¿everal New <hi>Branches</hi> grow forked, inÅ¿tead of Å¿hooting Å¿ingle, which in regularity would have grown Å¿traight, that end being indeed a real beginning of a <hi>Branch:</hi> This breaking then promiÅ¿es a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Figs,</hi> either for the Å¿econd, which is moÅ¿t common, or for the firÅ¿t of the Summer for the following year; it being certain, that from the Navel of every <hi>Leaf</hi> a <hi>Fig</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly grow, and Å¿ometimes two at once, for one of thoÅ¿e two SeaÅ¿ons.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Breaking,</hi> or Å¿mall <hi>Pruning</hi> of the <hi>Bud,</hi> which appears on the Extremity, Å¿erves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, as it Å¿eems, to make the <hi>Figs</hi> Å¿hoot out the Å¿ooner, and conÅ¿equently to Ripen them
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48210:166"/>
Å¿ooner, Å¿ince the firÅ¿t that come out of the <hi>Tree</hi> are always the firÅ¿t Ripe upon that <hi>Tree;</hi> It Å¿erves likewiÅ¿e, without doubt, to make them grow the larger, by reaÅ¿on that the <hi>Sap</hi> being thus hinder'd from riÅ¿ing as quick as it would have done without this <hi>Pruning,</hi> Å¿lips, as it were, into the adjacent Parts, and conÅ¿equently into the <hi>Figs,</hi> and Å¿o Å¿erves to nouriÅ¿h them better than they Å¿hould have been.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿ame Operation which we perform in <hi>Breaking</hi> or <hi>Cutting</hi> in the Months of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> the ends of the <hi>Shoots</hi> of the preceding year, which is to be underÅ¿tood of thoÅ¿e that are thick, and moderately long; for the Å¿lender ones muÅ¿t be almoÅ¿t taken away quite, and as for thoÅ¿e that are very thick, and very long, we have heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd how they muÅ¿t be Å¿horten'd: The Å¿ame Operation muÅ¿t be perform'd at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>June,</hi> upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hot in the Spring, and that likewiÅ¿e in Order to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply that very Summer the <hi>Branches</hi> that are to grow, and conÅ¿equently to multiply the firÅ¿t <hi>Figs</hi> of the following year; for many <hi>Figs</hi> muÅ¿t not be expected in either SeaÅ¿on, unleÅ¿s by means of <hi>Pinching</hi> a great many good new <hi>Branches</hi> be prepar'd, which happens infallibly, when People are careful of <hi>Pinching;</hi> beÅ¿ides, this very Operation produces yet a wonderful effect, which is to hinder the <hi>Tree</hi> from mounting too much, and too Å¿oon, and from having <hi>Branches</hi> that may prove too thick, and too long, as well as bare, which is much to be fear'd.</p>
                        <p>If the preceeding year Å¿ome thick <hi>Branches</hi> have been allow'd a pretty length, which in their time have been good and uÅ¿eful, and yet give cauÅ¿e to fear the inconvenience of ThinneÅ¿s, or BarrenneÅ¿s, they muÅ¿t in the Months of <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> eÅ¿pecially having no <hi>Fruit</hi> upon them, be Å¿horten'd very low, cloÅ¿e to the old <hi>Wood,</hi> in hopes that new <hi>Branches</hi> may proceed from that <hi>Pruning;</hi> but that is no more infallible here, than upon the old <hi>Branches</hi> of Å¿horten'd <hi>Peach-Trees:</hi> However, it will Å¿erve at leaÅ¿t not to leave any thing with too much length, which might cauÅ¿e an EmptineÅ¿s, or BarrenneÅ¿s; and in the mean time the <hi>Sap</hi> will perform its effect upon Å¿ome of the adjacent <hi>Branches,</hi> and Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alÅ¿o upon the old one that has been Å¿horten'd; but yet it is certain that <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿hoot Å¿o well, as from the Natural Extremity, I mean the Extremity of the <hi>Branches</hi> of the preceeding years growth, not having been Cut.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> in relation to their <hi>Fruit,</hi> are contrary to all other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> becauÅ¿e that the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> provided they be not of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> they being liable to it, as well as other <hi>Trees,</hi> produce the <hi>Fruit;</hi> whereas the Å¿lender ones produce it in other <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> therefore as much Care muÅ¿t be had in deÅ¿troying the Å¿lender <hi>Branches</hi> upon theÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> as in preÅ¿erving them upon others.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Suckers,</hi> are known here by flat <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> and their being at a great diÅ¿tance from each other, in the Å¿ame manner as upon Stone and Kernel <hi>Fruit;</hi> which <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿omewhat Å¿hort, which needs not be done to Å¿uch which being happily grown on the Extremities of other <hi>Branches,</hi> are both very good, and of a moderate length, and as Å¿uch have thick or large cloÅ¿e <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds.</hi>

                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e particularly to be Noted, That in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the thick <hi>Branches</hi> here is a greater Conflict to undergo, than in other <hi>Trees;</hi> Å¿ince, as we have already often Å¿aid, the thick <hi>Branches</hi> never produce or bear <hi>Fruit</hi> upon thoÅ¿e, and only Å¿erve for the Figure: Whereas in <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> the thick <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿erve both for the Figure, and for the Bearing of <hi>Fruit;</hi> Å¿o that particularly, as to the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in CaÅ¿es, whereof the Chief Beauty conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in remaining low; it Å¿eems almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to have them at once well form'd, to be of an agreeable Figure, and yet full of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which, notwithÅ¿tanding, is the main Point here; for as the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in CaÅ¿es naturally produce but little <hi>Wood,</hi> and that whatever <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> has but little <hi>Wood,</hi> can have but little <hi>Fruit.</hi> In Å¿hort'ning the thick <hi>Branches</hi> in proÅ¿pect of the Figure, we decline the <hi>Fruit.</hi> The only Medium to be obÅ¿erv'd in this, is always to Å¿horten Å¿ome of the thickeÅ¿t in every <hi>Tree,</hi> either old, or new, which will Å¿erve for the Beauty of the Figure; at the Å¿ame time venturing to leave all the other long, to enjoy the <hi>Fruit</hi> that appears upon them: In caÅ¿e any Misfortune be befal'n the firÅ¿t <hi>Figs,</hi> and that towards the middle of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> any be deÅ¿irous to Å¿horten alÅ¿o Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> that had been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> it may be done, and in Å¿o doing, the number of the Å¿econd <hi>Figs</hi> will receive Å¿o much diminution; but then, to make amends, the number of the firÅ¿t for the next year will be augmented, by reaÅ¿on that the new <hi>Branches</hi> that Å¿hall Å¿hoot from thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall have been <hi>Prun'd,</hi> will not come out Å¿oon enough to produce Autumn <hi>Figs,</hi> but yet time enough for the others.</p>
                        <p>In hot Soils, all the <hi>Figs</hi> come out before the end of <hi>March,</hi> and the <hi>Trees</hi> begin to make new <hi>Shoots</hi> before the end of <hi>April,</hi> and the firÅ¿t <hi>Fruit</hi> Ripens before the end of <hi>June,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and the Å¿econd in the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> But in Cold Soils, like <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> the <hi>Figs</hi> do not come out till about the end of <hi>April,</hi> or even towards the middle of <hi>May;</hi> and the <hi>Shoots</hi> do not begin to appear neither, until towards the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48210:166"/>
middle of <hi>May;</hi> and the <hi>Shoots</hi> do not begin to appear neither, until towards the middle of <hi>May;</hi> and conÅ¿equently, the firÅ¿t <hi>Fruits</hi> do not ripen there, until the middle or end of <hi>July;</hi> and the Å¿econd, towards the latter end of <hi>September.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From every <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> which, in <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> remain, in the Spring, upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the preceding Year, we may certainly expect a <hi>Fig,</hi> and Å¿ometimes two; but we muÅ¿t never have above one which may come to good, if the SeaÅ¿on be favourable: And, moreover, every <hi>Eye</hi> may produce a <hi>Branch,</hi> which does not always happen, it depending from the thickneÅ¿s of the Mother-<hi>Branch,</hi> and the Å¿hort <hi>Pruning</hi> that has been perform'd upon it. BeÅ¿ides, every good <hi>Branch</hi> commonly produces to the number of Å¿ix or Å¿even <hi>Figs;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, that it may be grown longer, by Å¿ix or Å¿even <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds;</hi> either from the Month of <hi>March,</hi> to the middle of <hi>June;</hi> or from the middle of <hi>June,</hi> to the end of Autumn; it Å¿eldom produces any more. BeÅ¿ides, <hi>Figs</hi> never grow twice upon the Å¿ame <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Bud;</hi> that which has produc'd any in Autumn, whether they ripen, or no, producing no others the next SeaÅ¿on.</p>
                        <p>More Preparations muÅ¿t be us'd to make the firÅ¿t <hi>Figs</hi> grow, than the Å¿econd; there being conÅ¿tantly but too many of theÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e that Å¿ound <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> commonly <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine <hi>Sprigs,</hi> and that every <hi>Leaf</hi> form'd before MidÅ¿ummer, generally owes a <hi>Fig,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Autumn of that very Year, which is moÅ¿t common; or for the Summer of the following Year, when the <hi>Fig</hi> has not appear'd in Autumn. This being Å¿o, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens almoÅ¿t always, that abundance of thoÅ¿e <hi>Figs</hi> for <hi>Autumn</hi> do appear, which grow in vain, by reaÅ¿on that they Å¿eldom ripen; the cold Rains, that are frequent and common in Autumn, and the white FroÅ¿ts of the SeaÅ¿on, killing them almoÅ¿t all, either in making them burÅ¿t, and open, and Å¿o fall, or drop; or elÅ¿e, hindring them from growing to Maturity: And, as for theÅ¿e, it is not to be expected, that, notwithÅ¿tanding they have been preÅ¿erv'd <hi>Green</hi> in the Winter, and well fix'd to the <hi>Tree,</hi> the Renewing of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the Spring Å¿hould bring them to any Perfection; it being moÅ¿t certain, that they will drop, without coming to any thing.</p>
                        <p>But as for thoÅ¿e <hi>Figs</hi> we call <hi>Figs</hi> of the firÅ¿t <hi>Sap,</hi> or MidÅ¿ummer-<hi>Figs,</hi> as they only grow in proportion to the <hi>Shoots</hi> and <hi>Leaves, Å¿hot</hi> from MidÅ¿ummer, till towards Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; and that often <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> particularly in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> produce but few <hi>Branches,</hi> and regularly Å¿hort, having but little Vigour in the Summer, and yet being oblig'd to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h their <hi>Fruit,</hi> it follows conÅ¿equently, that they produce but a Å¿mall quantity of <hi>Fruit</hi> for the Spring, the weak <hi>Branches</hi> neither being capable to bear any at that time, nor when they do bear them, of preÅ¿erving them againÅ¿t the Cold of the SeaÅ¿on; wherefore it is fit to have very particular Regards, in order to make <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> and particularly thoÅ¿e that are in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> produce fine <hi>Shoots</hi> after MidÅ¿ummer, which depends upon the Vigour of the <hi>Foot;</hi> and more particularly on the AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance we ought to afford it, when in that Condition.</p>
                        <p>When Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> are preÅ¿erv'd, being Å¿omewhat weak, they muÅ¿t be kept very Å¿hort, to the end that the Remainder may be the better nouriÅ¿h'd, and that the <hi>Figs,</hi> if any can grow upon them, may grow the finer; but Å¿till, upon condition that if any other weak <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hould <hi>Å¿hoot</hi> from thoÅ¿e, they Å¿hall all be taken away, and none preÅ¿erv'd, unleÅ¿s perhaps the loweÅ¿t, which thereby may grow to a reaÅ¿onable thickneÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿ame <hi>Care</hi> that is taken of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> juÅ¿t after the Winter, placing them in good Situations, ought likewiÅ¿e to be taken to place them alÅ¿o in proper Situations at the Coming in of Autumn, to the end that, in order to the Maturity of the <hi>Figs</hi> of that SeaÅ¿on, they may receive the Benefit of the little Heat the Sun affords us at that time. But then, none of the <hi>Roots</hi> muÅ¿t be allow'd to get out of the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that there being a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of pulling them out, in tranÅ¿porting of the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> both the <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> would Å¿uffer conÅ¿iderably by it, which muÅ¿t needs create a Subject of Trouble.</p>
                        <p>But then, the only Remedy, when the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> has touch'd the <hi>Ground</hi> in the Summer time, the <hi>Roots</hi> of the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> having extreamly multiply'd there, and the <hi>Trees</hi> being really the better for it, Å¿o as not to Å¿tand in need of Å¿uch frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> though, at the Å¿ame time, it rots the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> the Å¿ooner; the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> having thus touch'd the <hi>Ground,</hi> it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary, before they are put in the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> to cut all thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> well; or, at leaÅ¿t, it muÅ¿t be done at the Taking them out again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are carry'd to the place where they are to remain all the Summer; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part of them has been expos'd to the Air, abÅ¿olutely Å¿poils: But, after having taken off what is Å¿poil'd, thoÅ¿e very <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> being again put upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> will multiply again, more than the Year before. And it is not amiÅ¿s to Å¿acrifice thus Å¿ome <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as begin to be old, and of which the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> have been long <hi>Cas'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48210:167"/>
Moreover, Whereas the firÅ¿t <hi>Figs</hi> may always ripen, whatever Situation they be in, the Heats of the Summer being Å¿ufficient for that, it induces me to place <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> willingly into the WeÅ¿t Part, and pretty often likewiÅ¿e to the North; by which means I have <hi>Figs</hi> much longer, thoÅ¿e that are plac'd in thoÅ¿e indifferent Situations ripening after the others; Å¿o that they almoÅ¿t Å¿upply the Interval, between the FirÅ¿t, and the Second: In which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿e others to imitate me; but yet, upon condition, not to expect Autumn-<hi>Figs</hi> from Å¿uch Situations, unleÅ¿s the SeaÅ¿on proves extraordinary fine and dry. And when <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> have been plac'd in Å¿uch ExpoÅ¿itions, or Situations, great Care muÅ¿t be taken to cover them yet better in the Winter, than thoÅ¿e that were plac'd in the other Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations.</p>
                        <p>Particular Precautions muÅ¿t be had for <hi>Fig-Trees Planted</hi> in the <hi>Ground;</hi> eÅ¿pecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to place them under the <hi>Spouts</hi> of great <hi>Coverings,</hi> which might threaten them with too much <hi>Water,</hi> and particularly, with a great deal of mizling FroÅ¿t, as well in the Winter, as in the Spring: And in caÅ¿e there be no other place proper to Plant them in, thoÅ¿e <hi>Spouts</hi> muÅ¿t be turn'd Å¿ome other way, by means of Å¿ome Wooden or Leaden Gutter.</p>
                        <p>As to the Method of <hi>Pruning Dwarf-Standard Fig-Trees,</hi> there is nothing to be added to what we have already Å¿aid of thoÅ¿e that are <hi>Planted</hi> againÅ¿t <hi>Walls,</hi> or in <hi>CaÅ¿es.</hi> The <hi>Dwarf-Standards</hi> will not produce <hi>Figs,</hi> altogether Å¿o Å¿oon as thoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> that are well Expos'd, and even later than thoÅ¿e that are in <hi>CaÅ¿es:</hi> which being heated by the Sun, on all Å¿ides of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> ripen, as we have already Å¿aid, a little Å¿ooner than the <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> and even Å¿ooner than the <hi>EÅ¿paliers.</hi> ThoÅ¿e <hi>Dwarfs</hi> will likewiÅ¿e be a little troubleÅ¿om for the Coverings of the Winter, and therefore it is dangerous to have any of thoÅ¿e, unleÅ¿s it be in very little, private places, and thoÅ¿e Å¿helter'd from great FroÅ¿ts: they will likewiÅ¿e be apt to cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion, if, being in a good Soil, Endeavours be us'd to keep them low, and to hinder them at the Å¿ame time, from producing great <hi>Shoots:</hi> For which reaÅ¿on, it will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to <hi>Pinch</hi> them carefully, and to have always Å¿ome thick <hi>Branches, Prun'd</hi> low; and finally, to clear and free them often, as well from Å¿o many old worn out <hi>Branches,</hi> as from all new <hi>Suckers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To that End, Å¿uch <hi>Dwarf-Standards</hi> muÅ¿t always be kept at a very conÅ¿iderable diÅ¿tance from each other, in order to lay a great many <hi>Branches</hi> yearly into the <hi>Ground,</hi> thereby to eaÅ¿e the whole Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> Å¿uffering it to grow in breadth as much as it pleaÅ¿es. As to their Coverings, Care muÅ¿t be taken, at the End of Autumn, firÅ¿t to aÅ¿Å¿emble and cloÅ¿e their <hi>Branches</hi> together with <hi>Oziers,</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> fix'd into the <hi>Ground,</hi> that they may form a kind of Bowl, or Pyramid; cloÅ¿ing it afterwards with long, dry <hi>Dung,</hi> as we have done to <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>EÅ¿paliers;</hi> but yet they muÅ¿t not be uncover'd quite, altogether Å¿o Å¿oon as the others that are Å¿helter'd by a <hi>Wall;</hi> and the Coverings muÅ¿t, by all means, be renew'd, during the Spring.</p>
                        <p>After having explain'd my Method, as well as poÅ¿Å¿ible I can, as well for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of all kinds of young <hi>Trees,</hi> during the four or five firÅ¿t Years of their being <hi>Planted,</hi> as for the <hi>Trimming</hi> for the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Sprigs,</hi> and <hi>Pinching</hi> of Å¿uch as may Å¿tand in need of it, having alÅ¿o explain'd my Method, as to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> planted either in the open <hi>Ground,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es;</hi> I now proceed, according to my PromiÅ¿e, to explain, with the Å¿ame ExactneÅ¿s, my Opinion, as to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of old <hi>Trees.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>SInce <hi>Pruning</hi> may be look'd upon as a kind of Remedy for <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and that really we have made uÅ¿e of the Rules and Principles thereof, in order to render the young <hi>Trees</hi> in our <hi>Gardens</hi> more agreeable as to their Figure, as well as more Fertile in fine and good <hi>Fruit,</hi> than they would have been without being <hi>Prun'd;</hi> being now to treat about a proper Remedy for Old <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> I am of Opinion, that, to make my Å¿elf the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underÅ¿tood, I muÅ¿t firÅ¿t of all Å¿uppoÅ¿e two things; the one in relation to their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, or WeakneÅ¿s: And I am likewiÅ¿e of Opinion, that it will be proper for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this laÅ¿t Part, before I meddle with the firÅ¿t, this being altogether grounded upon the other; and thoÅ¿e vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> requiring abÅ¿olutely to be treated in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from thoÅ¿e that are not Å¿o.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48210:167"/>
As to what relates to the Vigour or WeakneÅ¿s of <hi>Trees,</hi> we are to Å¿ay, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> are either very vigorous, producing abundance of thick <hi>Shoots,</hi> or very weak, hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any, or at moÅ¿t but very Å¿mall ones; or in fine, neither incline too much to an exceÅ¿s of Vigour, or of WeakneÅ¿s, Å¿o as to be in the CaÅ¿e we may wiÅ¿h to have them: TheÅ¿e are abÅ¿olutely the three different CaÅ¿es <hi>Trees</hi> can be in.</p>
                        <p>When they are very Vigorous, and as it were Furious, whether the Beauty of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure be already form'd, or not, we muÅ¿t Å¿till propoÅ¿e to our Å¿elves, that whenever we go about to <hi>Prune</hi> them, it will be proper above all things, to leave a great Burthen upon them, that is, to leave a great many out-lets upon them, not only for <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> but alÅ¿o for <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> which is perform'd two ways; of which the firÅ¿t is to allow thick <hi>Branches</hi> preÅ¿erv'd for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing or preÅ¿erving of a Beautiful Figure, Å¿omewhat of an extraordinary length: The Å¿econd is, not wholly to take away hardly any of their thick new <hi>Branches,</hi> eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as Å¿hoot outward; but after having choÅ¿en in each part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> among the thick ones, that which appears the beÅ¿t plac'd to Contribute to the Beauty of the Figure, and that with an intention to Å¿horten it moderately, according to its Situation, which I explain elÅ¿ewhere; after that, I Å¿ay, the adjacent <hi>Branches</hi> to that muÅ¿t be cut very Å¿hort, that is, if they Å¿hoot outwards they muÅ¿t be Cut Å¿lantingly, within one or two <hi>Eyes</hi> of the place whence they proceed; if altogether inward, within the thickneÅ¿s of a Crown Piece.</p>
                        <p>When I Å¿peak of allowing Å¿omewhat of an extraordinary length in <hi>Praning</hi> to a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> I mean a Foot and a half, or two Foot at moÅ¿t, and yet I Å¿eldom Practice this my Å¿elf; but whenever I do, 'tis always with an intention of reducing that extraordinary length to a more moderate one, as Å¿oon as the <hi>Tree</hi> bears <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to underÅ¿tand what is meant by Å¿hortning a Thick <hi>Branch</hi> moderately, it will be proper to remember, that whereas from the Extremity of a thick <hi>Branch</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> Å¿everal other new ones will proceed, Care muÅ¿t be taken to leave room, that is, an empty Place, where theÅ¿e New <hi>Branches</hi> may eaÅ¿ily lodge themÅ¿elves, without cauÅ¿ing any ConfuÅ¿ion among one another, or with thoÅ¿e that are there already, or Å¿uch as are to come; which is the Point upon which I would have People regulate themÅ¿elves as to the moderate length which is to be allow'd to Å¿uch thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are to be <hi>Prun'd;</hi> but yet, in Regularity, a Vigorous <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t Å¿eldom be allow'd thick <hi>Branches,</hi> unleÅ¿s they be at leaÅ¿t Å¿even or eight Inches in length, and Å¿ometimes in CaÅ¿e of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they may be allow'd to the number of Eleven or Twelve, always remembring, that the Å¿aid <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be cut Å¿horter, whenever the <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hall Å¿atisfie us with <hi>Fruit;</hi> Å¿o that it depends on the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Prudence to allow more or leÅ¿s length to Å¿uch a <hi>Branch</hi> that is to be Å¿horten'd, and that as well in reÅ¿pect to the Vigour it appears to be of, as to the Place that is to be fill'd up in the Neighbourhood thereof.</p>
                        <p>When Old <hi>Trees</hi> are very Weak, commonly the beÅ¿t Expedlent is to take them away, and put young ones in their room, after having us'd all the Precaution neceÅ¿Å¿ary in Å¿uch CaÅ¿es; but if, on the Contrary, People will preÅ¿erve them, they muÅ¿t reÅ¿olve to disburthen or clear them extreamly, either in giving them the Figure which is proper to them, which perhaps they want, or in order to preÅ¿erve it, if already acquir'd; to which end, they muÅ¿t reÅ¿olve to leave very few <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> upon them, and to <hi>Prune</hi> them all Å¿hort, that is, five or Å¿ix Inches in length at moÅ¿t, even reÅ¿olving to leave but very few weak ones, and conÅ¿equently no uÅ¿eleÅ¿s ones, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as Å¿eem to be waÅ¿ted with Air, without having born any <hi>Fruit,</hi> or Å¿uch as are waÅ¿ted by having produc'd much; for as we have already obÅ¿erv'd in Å¿undry Places, <hi>Branches</hi> periÅ¿h in Bearing, and even Å¿ome PeriÅ¿h Å¿ometimes after having born: Therefore thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be conÅ¿iderably Å¿horten'd, or even taken away quite, when they appear altogether waÅ¿ted, and conÅ¿equently uÅ¿eleÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>But when <hi>Trees</hi> are moderate, Å¿o as neither to fall into the exceÅ¿s of Vigour, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, but on the contrary, bear a reaÅ¿onable quantity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and at the Å¿ame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Wood</hi> in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, according to our deÅ¿ires, both for us, and for themÅ¿elves; in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> being pretty well Å¿hap'd, it will be fit, in relation to them, to follow as well the Rules heretofore preÅ¿crib'd for young <hi>Trees,</hi> as thoÅ¿e we are going to preÅ¿cribe; and if thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> are ill Condition'd, or ill Shap'd, endeavours muÅ¿t be us'd to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them better, which we will viÅ¿ibly diÅ¿cover, after having firÅ¿t Explain'd what concerns the Figure, which is proper for all manner of Old <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon this CaÅ¿e, we muÅ¿t moreover Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees</hi> are either already <note place="margin">Perfections of the Figure of a <hi>Dwarf-Tree.</hi>
                           </note> defective, and in diÅ¿order, or perhaps are upon the point of becoming Å¿o: This is the firÅ¿t Reflection to be carefully made at firÅ¿t Å¿ight of a <hi>Tree</hi> that is to be <hi>Prun'd,</hi> whatever it may be, <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> or <hi>Dwarf,</hi> in order to reÅ¿olve with more eaÅ¿e upon what is to be done in relation to the Figure.</p>

                        <p>AS to the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, which Å¿uppoÅ¿es a <hi>Dwarf</hi> to be too high in the <hi>Stem,</hi> I think it need not trouble us much, if the <hi>Tree</hi> has been Planted long, becauÅ¿e it cannot be remedy'd without falling into conÅ¿iderable Inconveniencies, which Å¿hould be wholly to deÅ¿troy the head of the <hi>Dwarf,</hi> and conÅ¿equently Å¿et it back for the Å¿pace of three or four years from bearing <hi>Fruit:</hi> The Remedy would be violent, and therefore I do not think it fit to meddle with the <hi>Stem</hi> of Å¿uch a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> tho' too high, and in that reÅ¿pect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective: In that CaÅ¿e, I am only for Correcting the Defects of the Head.</p>
                        <p>But when the <hi>Tree</hi> has not been Planted many years, to wit, two or three years, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Head being ill begun, and not according to the Rules of Art, my Opinion is to Å¿horten it quite, to reduce it to the Rule, which preÅ¿cribes it to have a low <hi>Stem,</hi> as it is declar'd in the TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Plantations;</hi> which I had rather do, than expoÅ¿e my Å¿elf to leave it always with Å¿uch a Defect, which muÅ¿t offend the Å¿ight perpetually: A <hi>Tree</hi> well <hi>Rooted</hi> again, and afterwards Å¿horten'd, Å¿oon recovers it Å¿elf, Å¿o as to afford a great deal of pleaÅ¿ure, and upon that account we are not only Comforted, but even very much Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with having Å¿horten'd it in that manner.</p>
                        <p>As to the Å¿econd Defect of a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> which is its being confus'd in the middle; when I meet with a <hi>Tree</hi> thus confus'd in the Figure, and conÅ¿equently not very proper to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> I commonly look upon it as I would do upon a Great Lord, who really has a great EÅ¿tate, and yet is not eaÅ¿ie, by reaÅ¿on of the great Incumbrances that lye upon it: The Selling of Å¿ome part of his EÅ¿tate, or of a Place, might be capable to clear his Debts; whereas on the contrary, when I Å¿ee a <hi>Tree</hi> well Å¿hap'd, and well diÅ¿pos'd, I fancy I Å¿ee another Man, who by the wiÅ¿e Management of a Moderate EÅ¿tate, wants for nothing, and lives at eaÅ¿e and quiet.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I am for Correcting that Å¿econd Defect intirely, as well to afford the <hi>Tree</hi> the Beauty it ought to have, as to facilitate the means of making it bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that Å¿o much the rather, becauÅ¿e the Remedy is eaÅ¿ie, and the SucceÅ¿s Å¿peedy, certain, and without the leaÅ¿t danger.</p>
                        <p>'Tis only removing altogether a thick <hi>Branch</hi> from the middle, or perhaps two or three that cauÅ¿e that fullneÅ¿s; that is, this ConfuÅ¿ion; and remove them Å¿o, that the <hi>Sap</hi> which had form'd them, nouriÅ¿h'd them, and made them grow, may no longer find any

paÅ¿Å¿age to riÅ¿e up to the Å¿ame place, there to perform the Functions it was us'd to do; but Care muÅ¿t be taken that this very <hi>Sap</hi> in its common way, or road, cloÅ¿e to the firÅ¿t PaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age which is Å¿topp'd, may find another as good, and as eaÅ¿ie, Å¿o that it may be capable of uÅ¿ing it, and thereby fully to enter into Å¿ome thick adjacent <hi>Branches,</hi> juÅ¿t beneath thoÅ¿e that have been retrench'd, as it appears by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>And Å¿o there will be no fear of the growing of any falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Suckers</hi> there, nor of any new ConfuÅ¿ion, which would certainly happen, if, in the firÅ¿t place, thoÅ¿e thick <hi>Branches</hi> had been cut from the top, over Å¿ome weak Å¿mall <hi>Branches,</hi> and conÅ¿equently incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in their Å¿mall Mouth all the <hi>Sap</hi> which us'd to enter into thoÅ¿e that have been retrench'd.</p>
                        <p>Or, if in the Å¿econd place, part of the Å¿aid thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the middle had been left, whereas they ought to have been wholly taken away, or elÅ¿e would make a kind of Stump there.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Sap</hi> returning Å¿till from the <hi>Foot</hi> with its uÅ¿ual abundance, and returning through the Å¿ame Channel it was us'd to, either to the <hi>Stem,</hi> or Å¿ome thick <hi>Branch,</hi> and finding no Overture large enough to receive it; or perhaps finding none at all, this <hi>Sap,</hi> I Å¿ay, burÅ¿ts of neceÅ¿Å¿ity round about that Å¿mall <hi>Branch,</hi> over which the thick one was cut off, or elÅ¿e round about that <hi>Stump,</hi> or thoÅ¿e <hi>Stumps</hi> which were left, and in burÅ¿ting, makes a great many new <hi>Branches</hi> in that middle, and conÅ¿equently forms there the Å¿ame defect we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to Correct.</p>
                        <p>I have Å¿hown heretofore, that on Å¿uch OccaÅ¿ions, there are Å¿ometimes Å¿ome MaÅ¿ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troaks to be perform'd, to leave for a certain time a thick <hi>Branch</hi> over another thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which muÅ¿t be taken away; to the end that, as in the CaÅ¿e of Fountains, which are Å¿ometies vented, leÅ¿t the Winds might hinder the Water from performing its Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as it ought to do, a conÅ¿iderable part of <hi>Sap</hi> may be waÅ¿ted into thoÅ¿e kind of thick uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> which otherwiÅ¿e would ruine Å¿ome diÅ¿poÅ¿itions for <hi>Fruit,</hi> ready form'd, or others which might form themÅ¿elves: But after the <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿eems to perform its duty in relation to <hi>Fruit,</hi> we may without any Å¿cruple wholly take away Å¿uch thick <hi>Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> that are of no uÅ¿e for the Figure, and have only been left two or three years to waÅ¿te, as we have Å¿aid, an abundance of <hi>Sap</hi> which would have been troubleÅ¿om to us: BeÅ¿ides, the Overture of the <hi>Tree</hi> being made by means of Å¿ome thick <hi>Branches</hi> that has been taken out of the middle: It will be fit next to examine the remaining <hi>Branches,</hi> whether good, that is, grown according to the moÅ¿t common Order of Nature, or bad, being grown contrary to the Å¿aid Order; and conÅ¿equently <hi>Branches</hi> of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> in order to preÅ¿erve as many as can be of the firÅ¿t, which may be uÅ¿eful for <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Fruit,</hi> at the Å¿ame time, aÅ¿Å¿igning to each the length that may be proper for it, thereby to ruine the Ill ones, all, if the Beauty of the Figure requires it, conformably to the Idea we Å¿hall have form'd of it, or only part, which may happen when Å¿ome thick one chances to be Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently well plac'd to contribute to that Figure, which without it would prove imperfect.</p>
                        <p>As for the third defect, which relates to the roundneÅ¿s, it is not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily remedy'd, as the foregoing; it proceeds from that, when the <hi>Dwarf</hi> was firÅ¿t form'd, Care was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to order the Matter Å¿o, that the Head of the <hi>Tree</hi> might at leaÅ¿t be compos'd of two <hi>Branches,</hi> partly of an equal Å¿trength, or thickneÅ¿s, the one on one Å¿ide, the other on the other, to keep the Vigour of it in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure divided, or as it were in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> (when there happen to be three or four, the thing is yet eaÅ¿ier.)</p>
                        <p>But yet, two may be Å¿ufficient to that end, by reaÅ¿on that, as we have Å¿aid, each of them being afterwards <hi>Prun'd,</hi> as it ought to be, will Å¿hoot others on the Extremity of it upon the Å¿ides, which others being likewiÅ¿e <hi>Prun'd,</hi> will in their turn likewiÅ¿e Å¿hoot others.</p>
                        <p>And thus, from year to year, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> Å¿till performing a new <hi>Pruning,</hi> good new <hi>Branches</hi> will Å¿till form themÅ¿elves, which will contribute to form, and afterwards preÅ¿erve in our <hi>Trees</hi> that agreeable roundneÅ¿s, and that abundance of fine <hi>Fruit</hi> we deÅ¿ire.</p>
                        <p>This defect in the roundneÅ¿s, probably proceeds then from that the <hi>Tree</hi> when it was firÅ¿t Planted, having at the beginning only produc'd one thick <hi>Branch</hi> on one Å¿ide, with a weak one on the oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide, as it appears by the Figure; the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> inÅ¿tead of looking at firÅ¿t on that thick <hi>Branch</hi> as the only one, capable of forming a Å¿ine Head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method I have preÅ¿crib'd for the Conduct of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> when they are newly Planted; inÅ¿tead of that, I Å¿ay, has indifferently cut both this thick one, and at the Å¿ame time, this other Å¿mall one, leaving them perhaps each of an equal length, without any ProÅ¿pect as to the Figure, which I hold neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and thus the Å¿trength of the <hi>Sap</hi> Å¿till continuing its firÅ¿t road, which inclines it only to the thick <hi>Branch,</hi> Å¿till produces many new fine ones on that Å¿ide; and, whereas there enters but a very inconÅ¿iderable quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> in the Å¿mall Neighbouring <hi>Branch,</hi> tho' it grew at the Å¿ame time with the thick one, Å¿o it produces but a very Å¿mall number of Å¿mall new <hi>Branches,</hi> which periÅ¿h Å¿oon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48210:171"/>
after; that is, perhaps, after having born a little <hi>Fruit:</hi> Thus one Å¿ide grows Å¿till in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, being extreamly well furniÅ¿h'd, while the other remains weak, languiÅ¿hing, and thin; and conÅ¿equently the <hi>Tree</hi> being only well on one Å¿ide, makes a very ugly Figure, half flat, and half round, not in the leaÅ¿t anÅ¿wering the Figure that is requir'd in a <hi>Tree</hi> to be perfect, either in it Å¿elf, or for the pleaÅ¿ure of Å¿ight.</p>
                        <p>From thence it is eaÅ¿ie to judge that this defect in point of roundneÅ¿s is great, and even <note place="margin">Bonum ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrÃ¢ cauÅ¿Ã¢; malum ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet defectu.</note> difficult to Correct, at leaÅ¿t to be Corrected in few years; however, provided the <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> takes Care in <hi>Pruning,</hi> as he eaÅ¿ily may, to order it Å¿o, that yearly the thick <hi>Branch</hi> he <hi>Prunes</hi> may produce Å¿ome other likewiÅ¿e thick, Å¿hooting towards the Å¿ide that wants filling, furniÅ¿hing, and being made round; he may in time, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure attain to that round Figure.</p>
                        <p>Now, in order to underÅ¿tand how this may be perform'd with a little Cate and ForecaÅ¿t, it is fit to remember, that, as we have already Å¿aid, every <hi>Branch</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity Å¿hoot Å¿ome new ones on the Extremity of it, and that more or leÅ¿s, according to its thickneÅ¿s, and Å¿trength, and the length that has been allow'd to it: A thick, Å¿trong, and Å¿hort one producing commonly a greater quantity, and thoÅ¿e finer than either the thick and Å¿trong one that has been left long, or the weak one, whatever way it was <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that it is moÅ¿t true, that it is poÅ¿Å¿ible to <hi>Prune</hi> in Å¿uch a manner, from year to year, that among the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> (that are to come, and are to grow out of thoÅ¿e <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> that are on the Extremity of the Old one that has been <hi>Prun'd)</hi> there may always be Å¿ome Principal one, Å¿hooting toward the defective Å¿ide, which conÅ¿equently muÅ¿t be carefully preÅ¿erv'd, and <hi>Prun'd</hi> alÅ¿o with the Å¿ame regards, and thus this defect diminiÅ¿hing by degrees, the Perfection of roundneÅ¿s, which is wanting in the Figure, will be inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly Introduc'd.</p>
                        <p>In Correcting the third Defect of this <hi>Dwarf,</hi> the fourth is Corrected at the Å¿ame time, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in not being equally furniÅ¿h'd round about its Circumference; Å¿o that this <hi>Dwarf</hi> in loÅ¿ing the Defect it had in wanting of roundneÅ¿s, at the Å¿ame time acquires the fourth Perfection it ought to have, that is, it becomes as full on one Å¿ide, as it was on the other.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WE muÅ¿t impute the Defects of <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> to the Å¿ame CanÅ¿e, which is a failure in the firÅ¿t years againÅ¿t the Å¿ame Principles of <hi>Pruning,</hi> which had been tranÅ¿greÅ¿s'd in the forming of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and has now been Corrected by us: That which hinder'd the roundneÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e, is abÅ¿olutely the Å¿ame thing with that which has hinder'd the EÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hing of that equality of Å¿trength, without which the Å¿ides of a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> cannot be equally furniÅ¿h'd.</p>
                        <p>That is, the <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> muÅ¿t have produc'd the firÅ¿t year, Å¿ome <hi>Branches</hi> equally Å¿trong, oppoÅ¿ite one to another; or if it has Å¿hot but one Å¿trong one, the whole Beauty of the <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t be founded alone upon that, without truÅ¿ting to the weak ones that are grown at the Å¿ame time for any thing, but <hi>Fruit,</hi> and then their Death.</p>
                        <p>This Å¿ingle thick one, being at the Spring <hi>Prun'd</hi> Å¿omewhat Å¿hort, that is, within five or Å¿ix Inches, Å¿eldom fails, as we have Å¿aid, of Producing that very year at leaÅ¿t two thick ones, with Å¿ome Å¿mall ones; which two thick ones will be partly of an equal Å¿trength, and oppos'd to each other.</p>
                        <p>Now each of them having a Å¿ide to fill, will perform it well, provided the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> Å¿till remains MaÅ¿ter of the Extremity of them, Å¿o as not to let either Å¿lip up, as we have fully explain'd in the Conduct of our young <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> and conÅ¿equently this <hi>Wall-Fruit-Tree</hi> is commonly only defective by the Negligence, or rather want of Skill of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who being intruÅ¿ted with the Conduct thereof, has not had all the Regards we have explain'd in this <hi>TreatiÅ¿e</hi> for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of thick <hi>Branches:</hi> And therefore, whereas he may have been deficient for many years together in thoÅ¿e <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> againÅ¿t the good Principles of <hi>Pruning;</hi> it follows, that to repair the Defects of them, there are as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies to be fear'd, as we have demonÅ¿trated, in order to the repairing of thoÅ¿e of a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> being Å¿hot too high.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48210:171"/>
When the <hi>Trees</hi> are not too Old, I am for <hi>Å¿hort'ning</hi> the thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Å¿hot up within two or three years, as well in the CaÅ¿e of Kernel, as of Stone-<hi>Fruit;</hi> thoÅ¿e thick <hi>Branches</hi> being <hi>Å¿hort'ned,</hi> will produce new ones on their Extremities, which will begin a-new to form the agreeable Figure <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> ought to have; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that Figure, will not only bear abundance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> but will bear long, which thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> Å¿hot up too high cannot perform, the common heighth of the Walls not allowing it: And as for thoÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> that are Older, perhaps Å¿ome thick <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> may be <hi>Å¿hort'ned,</hi> which Expedient is pretty Å¿ecure in all Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> excepting <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> being <hi>Graff'd;</hi> for it is certain, that <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> growing from a Stone, live much longer than others, but then they do not bear <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿o Å¿oon; but in recompence, being Cut again, they Å¿till Å¿hoot VigorouÅ¿ly, which the others that have been <hi>Graff'd</hi> do not do, being Old, Infirm, and Weak, at the end of Ten or Twelve years: This is the reaÅ¿on why they can hardly Å¿hoot any new <hi>Branches</hi> through the hard dry Bark of an old <hi>Branch</hi> that Å¿hall have been Å¿horten'd upon them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in my Opinion, the beÅ¿t way is to leave thoÅ¿e Old <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are, without Performing the Grand Remedy upon them, which is to Å¿horten them; only <hi>Pruning</hi> them as if they were well-Condition'd, in order to get <hi>Fruit</hi> from them, as long as they are capable of affording Å¿uch as is Good, and Fair, with a ReÅ¿olve to deÅ¿troy them as Å¿oon as they ceaÅ¿e to bear Å¿uch. In the mean time, I think it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to remove the Earth from the Å¿ides, which I believe may be waÅ¿ted; at the Å¿ame time taking away the greateÅ¿t part of the Old <hi>Roots</hi> that may be found in moving of the Earth, putting afterwards good new Mould in the room of it, then Plant new <hi>Trees</hi> there, that may be young, and fine, and of the ChoiceÅ¿t <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the other kind of <hi>Trees</hi> that have been Stock'd up, or Shorten'd, either <hi>Pear, Fig, Abricot,</hi> or <hi>Plumb-Trees,</hi> their new <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be order'd according to the Rules heretofore EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd in the management of young <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> which without doubt will Å¿ucceed well.</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t Defect of a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> being Corrected, which, as we have Å¿aid, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in not being Å¿o well garniÅ¿h'd with good <hi>Branches</hi> on the Å¿ides, as to have an equality without the leaÅ¿t appearance of ConfuÅ¿ion; The Second, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in having thick <hi>Branches</hi> Å¿hot up too high, being but a Sequel of the firÅ¿t, or rather the Å¿ame thing, will conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be Corrected by the Å¿ame means.</p>
                        <p>The thick <hi>Branches</hi> which a Negligent or Unskillful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> has Å¿uffer'd to grow too long, have occaÅ¿ion'd all this diÅ¿order, for want of ConÅ¿idering, that whereas the New <hi>Branches</hi> commonly grow only on the Extremity of thoÅ¿e that have been <hi>Prun'd,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on the lower part; it follows of CourÅ¿e, that the lower part of Å¿uch as have been left too long of a Foot and an half, and more, muÅ¿t needs from a great Vacuity, or Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and conÅ¿equently Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> having been thus ill order'd, can never acquire the Beauty a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> ought to have, to be effectually in a good CaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>As for the next Defect, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in having one part ConfuÅ¿e, that is, too full, while the other wants fullneÅ¿s; it commonly proceeds, either from Old, Small, Wither'd, UÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> left by the Ignorant, or Negligent <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> or elÅ¿e from having Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd and Cut two, three, or four thick <hi>Branches</hi> cloÅ¿e by one another, of an equal length, contrary to a good Maxim which forbids it; it being certain, that Å¿ince every <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Prun'd,</hi> produces new ones, and often many; it being certain, I Å¿ay, that if many Cut <hi>Branches</hi> be left near one another, Å¿everal New ones will of CourÅ¿e Å¿hoot from them, which not finding empty places enough to fill up, will cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion where they are, while another part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> to which that <hi>Sap</hi> might have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, which occaÅ¿ions a great Defect here, becomes wretched, and forÅ¿aken, and as it were Å¿tarves.</p>
                        <p>The Rule which forbids this multiplicity of Thick Neighbouring <hi>Branches</hi> of an equal length, wills one only to be left in every Part, and that of a moderate length; to the end that the New ones it will produce, may Å¿everally GarniÅ¿h Å¿ome Places, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly without this ForecaÅ¿t, might prove empty, and thin: And in CaÅ¿e it be thought fit in one place, to leave two or three in proportion, as it proves more or leÅ¿s Vigorous, or Thin in that place, they muÅ¿t all differ exceedingly in length, and look on different Å¿ides, which may require being GarniÅ¿h'd; to the end that the new ones that are to grow, may cauÅ¿e a good Effect, inÅ¿tead of being cumberÅ¿om, Å¿o as to force one to take them away as Å¿oon as they are grown.</p>
                        <p>I have now declar'd in General what I think proper to Remedy by <hi>Pruning,</hi> the Grand Defects that are happen'd, and Å¿till happen daily in Old <hi>Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>

There now remains to tell, what I think proper to Remedy the Inconveniences that are like to befall Old <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may be Å¿ufficiently known by the Remarks I have juÅ¿t made, without any neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿aying more preciÅ¿ely, that it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary betimes to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the equality of Vigour, which being once Å¿o eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erv'd; and above all things, it is fit to be diffident of thick <hi>Branches,</hi> which never fail of UÅ¿urping a MaÅ¿tery wherever they begin to form themÅ¿elves.</p>

And therefore the firÅ¿t thing to be done, is to Examine at firÅ¿t, whether the <hi>Tree</hi> be Conformable to the Idea of Beauty it ought to have, and muÅ¿t be very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood; or if not, in the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, 'tis but following what is EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for young <hi>Trees;</hi> but particularly, when they Å¿eem to Å¿werve from a fine Figure, Care muÅ¿t be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to oppoÅ¿e it with Vigour, and ExactneÅ¿s: So that if one Å¿ide Å¿eems to weaken, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours muÅ¿t be us'd to Å¿trengthen it again, by retrenching Å¿ome thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are Å¿uperiour to it; that is, when the Condition of the <hi>Tree</hi> can permit it: For as one Å¿ide never weakens conÅ¿iderably, without the others Å¿trengthning at the Å¿ame time, as Å¿oon as it is obÅ¿erv'd that the other Å¿ide Å¿eems to Å¿trengthen in an extraordinary manner; inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that Å¿ome <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hall have thicken'd ConÅ¿iderably, and have produc'd a great number of others, that thick one muÅ¿t immediately be Cut off, over one looking on the weaker Å¿ide, thereby going to the Exteriour Source of that Defect, and Å¿topping it, even in the Original; and Å¿o ConÅ¿equently, whether one <hi>Branch</hi> only, or more, Å¿hoot out too much, the current of the <hi>Sap</hi> is turn'd aÅ¿ide; and whereas that <hi>Sap</hi> muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity have a CourÅ¿e, if it be Å¿top'd on one Å¿ide, it will incline to another, and by thus dividing it, we contribute to the equality of Vigour, without which, a <hi>Tree</hi> can never have the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Figure that is proper to it, and which we ought to Endeavour to procure.</p>
                        <p>This is for the preÅ¿ent all I have to Å¿ay in Relation to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> Let us now proceed to the <hi>Vine,</hi> which is not near Å¿o long, or difficult to Explain.</p>

                           <p>Of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>OF all the things the Art of <hi>Husbandry</hi> Å¿ubjects to <hi>Pruning,</hi> and are commonly <hi>Prun'd</hi> once a year; nothing to me Å¿eems to require it Å¿o much as <hi>Vines,</hi> and nothing more eaÅ¿ily Perform'd: Both which PropoÅ¿itions I am perÅ¿waded of, and will prove hereafter. In the mean time, I may Å¿ay by the by, that Earth hardly nouriÅ¿hes any thing that is Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to more Accidents, or is oftner afflicted, than a <hi>Vine;</hi> but then, on the other Å¿ide, I may likewiÅ¿e affirm, that nothing on Earth would be happier in its Productions, if the wiÅ¿hes of Men could PreÅ¿erve it from all manner of Misfortunes. It will not be proper to make the Apology of it here, it not being the deÅ¿ign of this <hi>TreatiÅ¿e;</hi> it is daily Å¿ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prais'd by others: And tho' I were Å¿o minded, I could hardly Å¿ay any thing in favour of it, that were not tireÅ¿om.</p>
                        <p>The Proof of my firÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition is grounded upon this, That conÅ¿tantly a <hi>Vine</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be <hi>Prun'd,</hi> PeriÅ¿hes Å¿oon after; not in relation to the Foot, which works as it us'd to do, without regard to what relates to the Head, but in relation to the <hi>Fruit;</hi> Å¿ince it neither produces any Å¿o good, Å¿o fine, or Å¿o well fed, as that which is regularly <hi>Prun'd,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that (Lively and Sprightly as it is, perhaps beyond any Plant we are acquainted with) when it is well, it commonly Å¿hoots <hi>Wood</hi> furiouÅ¿ly, even Å¿everal <hi>Branches</hi> in one Summer, and thoÅ¿e thick enough, each five or Å¿ix Fathom long, every one of thoÅ¿e Å¿hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Å¿ame time a vaÅ¿t number of bad Å¿mall <hi>Branches</hi> all along the thick ones, which is a thing Å¿ufficiently known by every body.</p>
                        <p>Now theÅ¿e Å¿mall <hi>Branches</hi> in relation to <hi>Vines,</hi> no more than the too great quantity of large, thick, long ones in relation to <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> have no-wiÅ¿e the Gift of Fertility: On the contrary, they remain uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and Å¿o conÅ¿ume to no purpoÅ¿e, a conÅ¿iderable quantity
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48210:172"/>
of <hi>Sap,</hi> which might be imploy'd to produce <hi>Fruit;</hi> therefore it is fit to avoid that great quantity of uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches</hi> upon <hi>Vines,</hi> which can be done no otherwiÅ¿e than by <hi>Pruning,</hi> and conÅ¿equently it is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to <hi>Prune</hi> a <hi>Vine;</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that it is leÅ¿s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious for a <hi>Vine</hi> to be ill <hi>Prun'd,</hi> than not <hi>Prun'd</hi> at all: For at leaÅ¿t this <hi>Pruning,</hi> tho' ill perform'd, occaÅ¿ions a great benefit, in hindring the <hi>Sap</hi> from waÅ¿ting, or being diÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, as it would be in the long <hi>Branches</hi> that we retrench in <hi>Pruning,</hi> it producing at the Å¿ame time other <hi>Branches</hi> from the <hi>Foot,</hi> which will prove more uÅ¿eful: From whence it follows, that in our <hi>Husbandry</hi> nothing requires Å¿o much being <hi>Prun'd</hi> as a <hi>Vine;</hi> and indeed, as we have already obÅ¿erv'd, we Å¿tand indebted to the <hi>Vine</hi> for the firÅ¿t beginnings of <hi>Pruning,</hi> which is now practis'd Å¿o uÅ¿efully by <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> and <hi>Vine-DreÅ¿Å¿ers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ReaÅ¿on which made me affirm, that nothing appears Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to be <hi>Prun'd</hi> as a <hi>Vine,</hi> (and this is my Å¿econd PropoÅ¿ition) is, that in my Opinion nothing puniÅ¿hes the Defects that are committed in <hi>Pruning</hi> leÅ¿s than a <hi>Vine</hi> does. We have daily a thouÅ¿and Examples of it in common <hi>Vineyards,</hi> where we Å¿eldom meet a <hi>Vine-DreÅ¿Å¿er</hi> Skillful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to underÅ¿tand the true method of <hi>Pruning</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> and conÅ¿equently of giving a good ReaÅ¿on for what he does; and yet thoÅ¿e very <hi>Vine-DreÅ¿Å¿ers</hi> Å¿eldom fail of having yearly a pretty good <hi>Vintage,</hi> provided the SeaÅ¿ons do not hinder it.</p>
                        <p>Thus we Å¿ee that <hi>Vines,</hi> tho' ill <hi>Prun'd,</hi> provided the <hi>Foot</hi> be in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, do not fail of producing abundance of fine <hi>Wood,</hi> and conÅ¿equently a great deal of <hi>Fruit;</hi> therefore I had reaÅ¿on to Å¿ay, that nothing is more eaÅ¿ie to <hi>Prune</hi> than a <hi>Vine:</hi> For indeed, whereas the <hi>Roots</hi> of it are extreamly Active, they produce abundance of <hi>Sap,</hi> which of CourÅ¿e makes a great many large new <hi>Branches,</hi> eÅ¿pecially upon thoÅ¿e that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> the year before. Every one of thoÅ¿e new <hi>Branches</hi> commonly Å¿hoots <hi>Fruit</hi> on the fifth and Å¿ixth <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> and even pretty often on the Å¿eventh; and that which is Å¿ingular in a <hi>Vine,</hi> is, that it produces its <hi>Fruit</hi> at the Å¿ame time with the <hi>Branches;</hi> for the <hi>Fruit</hi> does not grow afterwards here, as it does on the <hi>Branches</hi> of other <hi>Fruit-</hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Plants:</hi> And indeed, no <hi>Fruit</hi> muÅ¿t be expected on a <hi>Vine,</hi> unleÅ¿s it comes out at the Å¿ame moment with the <hi>Branches,</hi> which is a truth known by every body.</p>
                        <p>Commonly every good new <hi>Branch</hi> produces at leaÅ¿t two fine Bunches of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which Å¿eldom fails; and this furniÅ¿hes a pretty conÅ¿iderable quantity of Wine; but when every <hi>Branch,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t the Major part produces Three, which happens Å¿ometimes, then we have a full <hi>Vintage;</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿ing always, that neither Hail, FroÅ¿t, or bad Rains, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e, which falling at the time of the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> make the <hi>Grapes</hi> run; I Å¿ay, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing thoÅ¿e Enemies to <hi>Vines</hi> have Å¿poil'd nothing in its Productions.</p>
                        <p>I need not mention in this <hi>TreatiÅ¿e</hi> of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> the manner of Planting, or Multiplying it; for beÅ¿ides that, it is not a proper place for it, nothing can be more generally known, than thoÅ¿e two Articles are: So that I Å¿hall only inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon the <hi>Pruning</hi> part, which I look upon to be very neceÅ¿Å¿ary, by reaÅ¿on of four or five Å¿orts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> that are commonly introduc'd in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> and are indeed the Chief Adornments of them, I mean <hi>MuÅ¿cadins,</hi> which are the moÅ¿t ConÅ¿iderable; the others are <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, PrecoÅ¿es,</hi> or early <hi>Grapes, Currans,</hi> even <hi>Bourdelais</hi> not being excluded; not indeed for the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿ons proper to the others, but for the ReaÅ¿ons explain'd in that part, which Treats of the good uÅ¿e that is to be made of the Walls of every <hi>Garden;</hi> and Å¿hews that <hi>Bourdelais</hi> are uÅ¿eful both for <hi>Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Verjuice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Å¿hall begin this Å¿mall <hi>TreatiÅ¿e</hi> of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> by Å¿aying, that among the good <hi>Grapes,</hi> which CompoÅ¿e part of our <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and the common <hi>Grapes</hi> that grow in <hi>Vineyards,</hi> there is particularly this great difference; that in our <hi>Gardens</hi> we neither require abundance of Bunches, or abundance of <hi>Grapes</hi> upon thoÅ¿e Bunches; we deÅ¿ire thin Bunches, with few <hi>Grapes</hi> upon them, provided they be large, firm, and crackling; to the end that the SeaÅ¿on for Maturity being favourable, we may have the pleaÅ¿ure we had propos'd to our Å¿elves; which never happens when the <hi>Grapes</hi> are too cloÅ¿e; whereas in <hi>Vineyards</hi> they have different ProÅ¿pects, and with reaÅ¿on, deÅ¿iring nothing Å¿o much, as the abundance of Bunches, and quantity of <hi>Grapes</hi> upon each of them.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay, moreover, that a good and well amended Soil is not proper to produce good <hi>Grapes</hi> in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> eÅ¿pecially for <hi>MuÅ¿cadins;</hi> we rather want a Soil moderately fat, provided it be not too much worn, and be well Å¿ituated; and laÅ¿tly, provided the <hi>Plants</hi> are neither too old, nor too young; And, in caÅ¿e they be very Vigorous, not too cloÅ¿e one to another, Å¿o as to cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion; all which Conditions are very neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the goodneÅ¿s of <hi>MuÅ¿cadin,</hi> and without doubt to contribute conÅ¿iderably to it, nothing can be of more uÅ¿e, than a Skillful <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48210:173"/>
In Order to Perform it skillfully, we are to Examine two Principal Things; firÅ¿t, the Vigour of the whole <hi>Plant</hi> that is to be <hi>Prun'd;</hi> and Å¿econdly, the ThickneÅ¿s or Strength of every <hi>Branch</hi> upon which the <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be perform'd; for as to the time of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> nothing is to be added to what has been Å¿aid of the time of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> Å¿ince all the Å¿ame ConÅ¿iderations are to be had in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> as have been had in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the firÅ¿t Point in queÅ¿tion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vigour of the <hi>Plant</hi> (which is known by the thickneÅ¿s, and number of new <hi>Shoots)</hi> the Chief thing to be done, is always to leave a great burthen to thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants,</hi> that are very Vigorous; I mean a great many <hi>Prun'd Branches,</hi> whether thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> have as yet but one Arm, as when they are very young, or have many, as they may have after the fifth or Å¿ixth year of their being <hi>Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> But yet, in either CaÅ¿e, that great Burthen muÅ¿t be Å¿o well mannag'd, that it may have no ConfuÅ¿ion: And whereas very Vigorous <hi>Plants</hi> muÅ¿t be greatly burthen'd, Å¿o always in proportion, few Cut <hi>Branches</hi> muÅ¿t be left upon Å¿uch as are but moderately Å¿trong, and yet leÅ¿s upon thoÅ¿e that are very weak.</p>
                        <p>As to the Å¿econd Point, which relates to the thickneÅ¿s of every <hi>Branch</hi> upon which the <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be Perform'd; always Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the regards I adviÅ¿e for the beÅ¿t Plac'd, which I will explain in the Sequel. That being done, I am always for <hi>Pruning</hi> upon the thickeÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> which indeed are the beÅ¿t; at leaÅ¿t it muÅ¿t never be perform'd upon the Weak ones; Å¿o that if the <hi>Trimming</hi> of the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uÅ¿eleÅ¿ <hi>Branches,</hi> that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be done yearly in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> had not taken away abundance of Å¿mall <hi>Shoots</hi> that commonly grow upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> or upon Å¿ome Old <hi>Branch,</hi> they muÅ¿t be remov'd at the time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> weak <hi>Shoots</hi> not producing near Å¿o much as the thick ones.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Branches</hi> to be <hi>Prun'd</hi> being choÅ¿en, which, as we have already declar'd, muÅ¿t always be the thickeÅ¿t, and beÅ¿t plac'd, we muÅ¿t now regulate the length that is proper to be allow'd to each of them: This Length ought commonly to be limited to four good <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> (which are the four firÅ¿t to be reckon'd from the Place whence the <hi>Branch</hi> has taken its Birth) unleÅ¿s it be with a deÅ¿ign to make the <hi>Plant</hi> of that <hi>Vine</hi> riÅ¿e all on a Å¿uddain, or elÅ¿e in the Å¿pace of two or three years, a great deal higher than it is, or elÅ¿e to make it garniÅ¿h Å¿ome diÅ¿tant place, in a Å¿hort Å¿pace of time; in which CaÅ¿e, it may be allow'd a great deal more length than we have now Regulated; but Å¿till on Condition, that when it Å¿hall once have reach'd that heighth, or propos'd diÅ¿tance, it muÅ¿t, if it prove well, always be kept to that, as it may be done with eaÅ¿e, by means of the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> I PractiÅ¿e, only yearly performing that <hi>Pruning,</hi> within the compaÅ¿s of the moderate length above mention'd.</p>
                        <p>In the performing of this, as well as all other manners of <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> theÅ¿e two Precautions muÅ¿t be had; both of which are pretty Material: The FirÅ¿t is, to Cut within a large Inch of the <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> that is to be the laÅ¿t, I mean on the Extremity of the <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Prun'd,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that if it were cut cloÅ¿er, that <hi>Eye</hi> would be wounded by it, and would not produce Å¿o fine a <hi>Å¿hoot:</hi> And the Å¿econd is, to order the Cut Å¿o, that the Å¿lope may always draw towards the Å¿ide that is oppoÅ¿ite to that laÅ¿t <hi>Eye,</hi> for fear the Water, or Bleedings which never fail dropping from that part that is <hi>Prun'd,</hi> when the <hi>Sap</hi> begins to riÅ¿e, Å¿hould fall upon that laÅ¿t <hi>Eye,</hi> becauÅ¿e it might prove prejudicial to it.</p>
                        <p>From thoÅ¿e four <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> left upon the <hi>Pruning</hi> of a Vigorous <hi>Plant,</hi> eÅ¿pecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t a Wall, may always be expected four new <hi>Branches,</hi> one from each; each of which, as we have already Å¿aid, will be furniÅ¿h'd with two or three Bunches of <hi>Grapes;</hi> that is, every good <hi>Branch</hi> being <hi>Prun'd</hi> within the compaÅ¿s of four <hi>Eyes,</hi> provided, no ill accident befall either of them, which happens Å¿ometimes, may produce four good new <hi>Branches</hi> together, with eight, ten, or twelve Bunches of <hi>Grapes</hi> for Autumn; Å¿o that one <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>Vine,</hi> upon which, at the Spring, Å¿hall have been left two good <hi>Branches Prun'd,</hi> may yield that very year twenty, or twenty four Bunches of <hi>Grapes;</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having four good <hi>Branches,</hi> may yield to the number of forty, and Å¿o it might riÅ¿e <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> always remembring to proportion the burthen in <hi>Pruning,</hi> to the Vigour of the <hi>Plant;</hi> likewiÅ¿e noting, that Å¿uch an abundance can only Å¿uit with <hi>Vines</hi> Planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t Walls.</p>
                        <p>I repeat again, that in <hi>Pruning,</hi> a great difference is to be made between a <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿hot from the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the preceeding year, and another; for indeed the firÅ¿t can only be look'd upon as a <hi>Branch</hi> of falÅ¿e <hi>Wood,</hi> and conÅ¿equently, muÅ¿t be abÅ¿olutely remov'd, unleÅ¿s there be no other upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> or that it may be of uÅ¿e, as it is pretty often, in order to Å¿horten the <hi>Stock</hi> cloÅ¿e to it, being neceÅ¿Å¿itated Å¿o to do, both to keep within the bounds of the heighth we affect, and becauÅ¿e Old <hi>Branches</hi> periÅ¿h, in fine, at the end of a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48210:173"/>
certain time, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently the old <hi>Wood</hi> being grown infirm, and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, it muÅ¿t needs be remov'd, as Å¿oon as it is perceiveable.</p>
                        <p>Now, Å¿ince for the ReaÅ¿ons aboveÅ¿aid, it has been thought fit to preÅ¿erve Å¿ome <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> Å¿hot from the Å¿tock, for inÅ¿tance, one or two in one and the Å¿ame place; in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e they muÅ¿t be Å¿hortned within the compaÅ¿s of two <hi>Eyes,</hi> in hopes of two fair good <hi>Branches,</hi> upon which we may lay the foundation of our hopes, for the re-eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of Å¿uch a <hi>Vine,</hi> whether it be the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> or only part of it, continuing during that year the common <hi>Pruning</hi> upon Å¿ome higher <hi>Branch,</hi> in order to have <hi>Fruit</hi> that year, reÅ¿olving to ruine it intirely, the <hi>Fruit</hi> being gather'd.</p>
                        <p>We have declar'd elÅ¿ewhere, that <hi>MuÅ¿cadin</hi> requires a pretty deal of heat, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that it dreads the exceÅ¿s, as much as the Mediocrity, or want of it: Therefore, as in Moderate Climes, like <hi>France,</hi> MuÅ¿cadin requires being plac'd to the South, or at leaÅ¿t to the EaÅ¿t, againÅ¿t Walls: So in very hot Countries, like <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> it dreads thoÅ¿e kind of Scituations, by reaÅ¿on that the heat being too Å¿corching, the <hi>Grapes</hi> wither, and burn, inÅ¿tead of ripening, and therefore only thrive there in the open air, where indeed they attain a miraculous Perfection, inÅ¿omuch, that all the InduÅ¿try of Man can never reach that Perfection, in Countries that lye Å¿omewhat to the <hi>North;</hi> for which ReaÅ¿on, we are oblig'd to confeÅ¿s, that tho' we need not envy other Climes for all other <hi>Fruits,</hi> viz. <hi>Peaches, Plums, Pears, Apples,</hi> and even <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Melons,</hi> &amp;c. yet in our Climes we can never approach the happineÅ¿s of Meridional Countries for <hi>MuÅ¿cadins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is to be obÅ¿erv'd particularly, that <hi>MuÅ¿cadin</hi> never thrives well againÅ¿t a high <hi>Treillis,</hi> it is always cloÅ¿e, Å¿mall, and flabby; wherefore I am not for placing it againÅ¿t Å¿uch, neither muÅ¿t it (eÅ¿pecially in <hi>EÅ¿paliers)</hi> be kept Å¿o low that the <hi>Grapes</hi> may touch the ground, or for the water of Spouts to Å¿purt gravel againÅ¿t it: For which reaÅ¿on, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a heighth of three, four, or five foot at moÅ¿t, particularly for <hi>MuÅ¿cadin,</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> on the <hi>EÅ¿palier</hi> may neither be much higher, nor much lower; this is what I meant heretofore, when I Å¿poke of a <hi>Branch,</hi> which being thick, is fit for <hi>Pruning,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be well plac'd.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿ame heighth is likewiÅ¿e very proper for <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿ellas, Currans,</hi> and early <hi>Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. but not Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary: <hi>Grapes</hi> that do not grow againÅ¿t <hi>Walls,</hi> indeed may, and ought to be kept much lower, whatever they be, but Å¿till we muÅ¿t not Å¿werve from the Maxim which forbids that <hi>Grapes</hi> that are to be eaten raw, Å¿hould touch the ground.</p>
                        <p>The length for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of every <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Vine</hi> being regulated, it will now be proper to examine to the bottom the burthen that is fit to be left upon every <hi>Plant,</hi> which is the moÅ¿t difficult, and moÅ¿t material Point.</p>
                        <p>When the preceeding years <hi>Pruning</hi> has produc'd three, or four <hi>Branches,</hi> as it may do, and often happens; then Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the <hi>Vine</hi> to be of the heighth above-mention'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by removing wholly all the weak ones, and as to the others, unleÅ¿s the Mother <hi>Branch,</hi> be very Vigorous, I never preÅ¿erve above two of them, and chuÅ¿e the thickeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e that, as we have already Å¿aid, they are doubtleÅ¿s the beÅ¿t, always chuÅ¿ing, as much as can be, the loweÅ¿t, provided they be thick, otherwiÅ¿e I keep to the higheÅ¿t; after that, I <hi>Prune</hi> them both, tho' not of an equal length, that is, allowing them each four <hi>Eyes,</hi> I only allow it the higheÅ¿t of the two, which I call the <hi>Pruning,</hi> and leave but two upon the loweÅ¿t, which I call a <hi>Stump;</hi> reÅ¿olving at the Å¿ame time, to remove the higheÅ¿t quite the following year; together with all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall Å¿hoot from it, reducing my Å¿elf wholly to the two that Å¿hall grow from that Å¿horteÅ¿t <hi>Branch,</hi> provided the Å¿aid <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿ucceeds according to my hopes, and appearances; for if any accident Å¿hould happen to it, Å¿o as not to produce two fine <hi>Branches,</hi> it Å¿hooting perhaps but one, I fix Å¿till to the fineÅ¿t, and loweÅ¿t of the <hi>Pruning,</hi> either to keep two of them, in caÅ¿e the Å¿hort <hi>Branch</hi> has fail'd quite; or at leaÅ¿t, I preÅ¿erve one for <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> the Å¿hort one having Å¿hot one, that may Å¿erve for a Å¿hort one the following year: This is the Method I daily attempt, not to Å¿werve from the heighth I affect, as good, and neceÅ¿Å¿ary.</p>
                        <p>I affirm, that by this Method, accompany'd with Å¿ome Culture, and the common CuÅ¿tom of Couching <hi>Branches</hi> from time, to time, in order to get new <hi>Wood,</hi> when the old begins to appear waÅ¿ted; as alÅ¿o with the help of a little <hi>Dung,</hi> or rather Å¿ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of <hi>Soil,</hi> when any diminution of Vigour is perceiv'd; I Å¿ay, I affirm that Å¿uch a Method will conÅ¿tantly preÅ¿erve every <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>Vine</hi> in a good CaÅ¿e, Vigorous, and without any Wounds, it will produce fine <hi>Grapes;</hi> and conÅ¿equently, if the SeaÅ¿on, and Clime contribute to afford it due Maturity, it will yield the Satisfaction that was expected from it.</p>
                        <p>But when the <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>Vine,</hi> eÅ¿pecially of <hi>MuÅ¿cadine,</hi> is extraordinary Vigorous, as it happens pretty often, inÅ¿omuch that the three, or four <hi>Branches</hi> it has Å¿hot from every
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48210:174"/>
                           <hi>Branch</hi> that has been <hi>Prun'd</hi> prove very thick; I am for preÅ¿erving of them all, <hi>Pruning</hi> both the one and the others of the Length heretofore Å¿pecifi'd, as well the higheÅ¿t for <hi>Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as the loweÅ¿t for a <hi>Stump;</hi> and in order to have room to place without ConfuÅ¿ion all the Young ones that are to proceed from that, I pull up Å¿ome Neighbouring <hi>Plant</hi> that might Å¿tand in my way: I likewiÅ¿e affect Å¿ometimes to chooÅ¿e for my <hi>Pruning</hi> the meaneÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branchss,</hi> always forming my <hi>Stump</hi> upon the loweÅ¿t of the thick ones, after which I cut the thickeÅ¿t that are near that mean one, that may be fit for <hi>Pruning</hi> within one <hi>Eye;</hi> in order that thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Stumps</hi> may waÅ¿t part of the Fury of the <hi>Foot,</hi> and that the mean <hi>Branch</hi> I have choÅ¿en for the beÅ¿t may not be inconvenienc'd by it, and made to bear CloÅ¿e <hi>Fruit,</hi> as it would certainly do, if it receiv'd the Vigour of all of them; Å¿o that in Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, I do not Cut the higheÅ¿t over the loweÅ¿t, as I uÅ¿e to do, when the <hi>Plant</hi> is but moderately Vigorous.</p>
                        <p>When our <hi>MuÅ¿cadines</hi> are in <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> the thing in the World I am moÅ¿t deÅ¿irous of, is, that which, excepting FroÅ¿t and Hail, is moÅ¿t to be dreaded for <hi>Vines,</hi> and that is Rain, in order to make part of the <hi>Grapes</hi> weep away, without which they would be too cloÅ¿e, as well as too Å¿mall and flabby; therefore when Nature does not allow me that Rain according to my deÅ¿ire, I endeavour to Å¿upply it with Waterings, which for the moÅ¿t part Å¿ucceeds well: I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s that it is very TroubleÅ¿ome for Å¿uch as have a great many <hi>Plants</hi> of <hi>MuÅ¿cadine,</hi> but yet the Experiment may be try'd upon a Å¿maller Number.</p>
                        <p>When the Year proves Extraordinary Drie at the Å¿eaÅ¿on of Maturity, if my Soil be naturally very Drie, I Water the <hi>Foot</hi> of my <hi>Vine</hi> largely, eÅ¿pecially when the <hi>Fruit</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to turn; Å¿uch a Watering, when neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and well perform'd in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> Contributes certainly to the largeneÅ¿s and firmneÅ¿s of the <hi>Grapes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Fruit-</hi>Bearing <hi>Branch,</hi> I mean the new <hi>Branch</hi> of that Years growth, is not of a MonÅ¿trous thickneÅ¿s, as Å¿ome of them prove Å¿ometimes, I Cut it in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> cloÅ¿e to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> being careful at the Å¿ame time, by means of Å¿ome Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leaves, to Å¿helter the <hi>Fruit</hi> from the great heat of the Sun, until it be at leaÅ¿t half ripe; for when it draws near Maturity, and this is a general Rule, it is proper to keep it a little bare, in order to afford it that <hi>Yellow</hi> Colour, which becomes it Å¿o well: The Cutting I juÅ¿t mention'd, augments the NouriÅ¿hment of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to make it larger, and more crackling, but it is not always certain nor infallible, neither muÅ¿t it be done, when the <hi>Branches</hi> are very thick; for whereas in the <hi>Summer</hi> they Å¿hoot almoÅ¿t as many Å¿mall new <hi>Branches,</hi> as they have <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> growing thick, would in courÅ¿e occaÅ¿ion a great ConfuÅ¿ion, for even when the <hi>Branches</hi> are not Å¿hortned, they notwithÅ¿tanding Å¿hoot, during the <hi>Summer,</hi> abundance of thoÅ¿e <hi>Buds,</hi> which muÅ¿t be carefully pull'd off, as being very UÅ¿eleÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>Happy are thoÅ¿e who are in Å¿uch Situations, where <hi>MuÅ¿cadine</hi> yearly ripens well, I cannot forbear envying their good Fortune a little. Happy likewiÅ¿e are thoÅ¿e, who having <hi>MuÅ¿cadine</hi> in an indifferent Climate, and pretty ill Ground, are favour'd with Å¿uch a <hi>Summer</hi> as we had in the Year 1676, for it is moÅ¿t certain, that we have ReaÅ¿on to be contented with that Years <hi>MuÅ¿cadine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it is not Å¿ufficient for our <hi>Vines</hi> to have abundance of fine <hi>Bunches,</hi> and thoÅ¿e not over Å¿tock'd with <hi>Grapes,</hi> nor for the SeaÅ¿on to be favourable to make them Ripen well, we have beÅ¿ides other conÅ¿iderable Enemies to dread for thoÅ¿e <hi>Grapes,</hi> as well as for <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> which are, beÅ¿ides Å¿ome FroÅ¿ts which make the <hi>Leaves</hi> fall, and long Cold Rains, which Rot the <hi>Grapes;</hi> Birds and Flies of Å¿everal kinds; as to the firÅ¿t, the firÅ¿t, the beÅ¿t way to prevent their MiÅ¿chief, is to hang Nets before thoÅ¿e <hi>Grapes</hi> which will hinder the Birds from coming near it; but that remedy is not very eaÅ¿ie, when there is abundance of <hi>MuÅ¿cadine</hi> to be preÅ¿erv'd: As to the Flies, we have the Remedy of Viols, that muÅ¿t be half filled with Water mix'd with a little Hony, or Sugar, which Expedient is Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known by every Body; thoÅ¿e Viols muÅ¿t be hung up in divers Places about the <hi>Vines</hi> with Å¿ome Pack-Thread, and thoÅ¿e Infects Å¿eldom fail of getting into them, being attracted by the SweetneÅ¿s of the Honey and Sugar, and there certainly periÅ¿h, as Å¿oon as they are got in, not being able to find the way out again; at leaÅ¿t abundance of them are deÅ¿troy'd that way, tho' it is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to deÅ¿troy them all: Care muÅ¿t be taken beÅ¿ides, to empty thoÅ¿e Viols, when any ConÅ¿iderable number of thoÅ¿e Flies are taken, otherwiÅ¿e no more of them would be taken, the Corruption and Stink they are Subject to, hinder the others from coming there: Then the Å¿aid Viols muÅ¿t be fill'd up again, as before, and plac'd a-new in proper Places.</p>
                        <p>Paper bags, and Linnen Cloths, are likewiÅ¿e us'd to cover every <hi>Bunch,</hi> but beÅ¿ides that it is a kind of Slavery, if on the one Å¿ide it Å¿erves to preÅ¿erve the <hi>Grapes</hi> Å¿o inclos'd from the Birds and Flies, on the other Å¿ide, it hinders the Sun from affording them that Å¿ame Yellow Colour, which is Å¿o agreeable to Å¿ight, and Contributes to make them better, as well as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48210:174"/>
to Å¿how their perfect Maturity: For to imagine that it preÅ¿erves the <hi>Grapes</hi> the longer ripe, is an Error I have experienc'd; The ReaÅ¿on is, that <hi>Fruit</hi> begins to Rot, as Å¿oon as it is throughly Ripe, and even Å¿ometimes before; and as Å¿oon as one <hi>Grape</hi> is tainted, it Å¿poils the next, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I muÅ¿t not omit adding, that in Å¿uch years as produce an infinite quantity of Bunches, as the year 1677. it will be fit to take away part of them in thoÅ¿e places where they are too thick, as alÅ¿o too thin, thoÅ¿e Bunches that appear too cloÅ¿e, or too full, as well as to Å¿horten on the lower Extremity Å¿uch as Å¿eem too long, that Extremity never ripening Å¿o well, as the Top, which always ripens the beÅ¿t of any other part.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e add, that no <hi>Grapes</hi> muÅ¿t be gather'd, eÅ¿pecially <hi>MuÅ¿cadine,</hi> until it be perfectly ripe, Å¿ince perfect Maturity is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to afford it that Å¿weetneÅ¿s, and flavour, without which, nothing can be leÅ¿s agreeable than <hi>MuÅ¿cadin:</hi> But this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Å¿hall be compos'd in one of the Chapters of the following Part; wherein I Å¿hall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whatever relates to the maturity of every particular <hi>Fruit.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Concerning the Care that is Requir'd to Pick <hi>Fruits,</hi> when they are too abounding.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WHereas the Intention of our <hi>Culture</hi> is not only to promote fair <hi>Fruit,</hi> but eÅ¿pecially to have it fine, and large; hoping thereby, and with ReaÅ¿on, that it will be the better for it, goodneÅ¿s Å¿eldom failing to attend Beauty, and LargeneÅ¿s of Size: And, whereas neither <hi>Pruning,</hi> nor the <hi>Trimming</hi> of the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s <hi>Branches,</hi> the <hi>Tillages,</hi> or <hi>Improvements</hi> of the Ground are always Å¿ufficient to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us this Beauty, and Size; it follows from thence, that there is Å¿omething elÅ¿e to be done, which is that I am to Treat of here.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that when we neither meet with FroÅ¿ts, or North-EaÅ¿t Winds, at the time that the <hi>Trees BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> and the <hi>Fruit</hi> knits; that is, in the Months of <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> I Å¿ay, it is certain, that pretty often in Å¿ome parts of the <hi>Tree</hi> there remains too much <hi>Fruit</hi> for it to be very Beautiful; for in the firÅ¿t place, in Relation to <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> whether <hi>Pears,</hi> or <hi>Apples,</hi> it is moÅ¿t certain that every <hi>Bud</hi> commonly produces many <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> and conÅ¿equently may produce many <hi>Fruits;</hi> that is, to the number of Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Å¿econd place, as to Å¿tone <hi>Fruits,</hi> altho' every <hi>Bud,</hi> excepting only plain <hi>Cherries, Morello's,</hi> white and black <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Bigarreaux,</hi> produce but one Å¿ingle <hi>Fruit,</hi> (for indeed, one <hi>Peach-Bud,</hi> and one <hi>Plum-Bud</hi> only produce one <hi>Peach,</hi> and one <hi>Plum,)</hi> yet, as every one of their <hi>Fruit-</hi>bearing <hi>Branches,</hi> is commonly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48210:175"/>
burthened with a great number of <hi>Buds,</hi> all cloÅ¿e to one another; it follows, that upon every one of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> there may remain an exceÅ¿Å¿ive quantity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Å¿ame Argument we uÅ¿e for the <hi>Buds</hi> of <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> may Å¿tand good for this; which is, that the more <hi>Fruit</hi> there knits upon one <hi>Bud,</hi> the Å¿maller the Portion muÅ¿t be; which at the Å¿hooting out of the <hi>Stalk</hi> out of that <hi>Bud,</hi> diÅ¿tributes it Å¿elf to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual <hi>Fruit;</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that if the quantity were leÅ¿s, 'tis moÅ¿t certain that the Portion of every one of the remaining would be the larger, and conÅ¿equently, the <hi>Fruit</hi> being the better fed, would be larger, and commonly better.</p>
                        <p>So likewiÅ¿e, the more <hi>Fruit</hi> there is upon a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit, Peach, Plum,</hi> or <hi>Apricock-Trees, &amp;c.</hi> the Å¿maller is the portion of NouriÅ¿hment, which diÅ¿tributes it Å¿elf to every <hi>Peach,</hi> and every <hi>Apricock,</hi> on Å¿uch <hi>Branches;</hi> Å¿o that had there been leÅ¿s upon every <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> would certainly have been better fed, and conÅ¿equently larger, and commonly better; Å¿ince indeed, it is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to have at once LargeneÅ¿s, Beauty, and GoodneÅ¿s, when there is too much <hi>Fruit,</hi> either upon one and the Å¿ame <hi>Bud,</hi> or upon one and the Å¿ame <hi>Branch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that a Skillful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who takes care to make his <hi>Trees BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> (which is in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure in his Power to do) it follows, I Å¿ay, that he muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e take yet more care to leave no more <hi>Fruit</hi> on every <hi>Tree,</hi> and particularly on every <hi>Bud,</hi> and on every <hi>Branch,</hi> than in proportion to what he may judge, that the <hi>Tree,</hi> or rather the <hi>Branch,</hi> is capable to NouriÅ¿h, in order to have that <hi>Fruit</hi> Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay, particularly the <hi>Branch;</hi> for, whereas the diÅ¿tribution of the NouriÅ¿hment which is deÅ¿tin'd to every one, is perform'd at the firÅ¿t entrance of the <hi>Branch,</hi> according to the largeneÅ¿s of the Overture thereof, and not according to the multitude of the <hi>Fruit</hi> it is burthen'd with, nor the meaÅ¿ure of NouriÅ¿hment it may Å¿tand in need of; it follows, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> of every one only receives the benefit of that which Nature allows the <hi>Branch</hi> it grows on, without receiving the leaÅ¿t benefit of that which it allows the Neighbouring <hi>Branches,</hi> every one of them having their peculiar Functions, and Å¿eparated Works, which is Å¿o certain, that a <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿ometimes bearing but one or two <hi>Fruits,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t, but a Å¿mall quantity, that <hi>Fruit</hi> is no finer than if it had produc'd a far greater quantity.</p>
                        <p>It likewiÅ¿e follows from thence, that the encreaÅ¿e of <hi>Sap,</hi> or NouriÅ¿hment, which may happen to every individual <hi>Fruit,</hi> only proceeds from the retrenchment that is made of the too great quantity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which grew on every <hi>Bud,</hi> or upon the Å¿ame <hi>Branch</hi> upon which it is found; as if every <hi>Bud,</hi> or every particular <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> made particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, having every one their particular Income, and each their Servants to nouriÅ¿h; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿omuch, that as the one receives no benefit from the abundance of the others, Å¿o the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of every one in particular, have a greater Å¿hare of nouriÅ¿hment; when the Å¿ame food, which, for Example, might have been divided, or Å¿har'd among Ten, is only divided among Two or Three.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is certain, that we muÅ¿t leave but few <hi>Fruits</hi> upon every <hi>Bud,</hi> and upon every <hi>Branch,</hi> if we deÅ¿ign to have them all both larger and finer; and whereas in <hi>Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> every <hi>Tree,</hi> I leave as many, and Å¿ometimes more good <hi>Buds,</hi> and good <hi>Fruit-Bearing-Branches</hi> upon it, than it Å¿eems capable to NouriÅ¿h, being Å¿enÅ¿ible of the hazards that are to be fear'd, before the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every one are Å¿afe; and being likewiÅ¿e deÅ¿irous that all the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hould be partly equally Beautiful, I never fail, after the <hi>Fruit</hi> is knit, to make an exact review of that which every <hi>Bud</hi> and every <hi>Branch</hi> contains, in order to leave no more on each Place, than it is likely to be able to NouriÅ¿h plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiÅ¿e certain, that, pretty often, Nature Å¿eems to take care to purge, or disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it Å¿elf of what it is over-burthen'd with; at leaÅ¿t the <hi>Spring</hi> Å¿ometimes produces of thoÅ¿e FroÅ¿ts, and <hi>North-EaÅ¿t</hi> Winds, we have already mention'd, which happen alÅ¿o pretty often between the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t;</hi> thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>North-EaÅ¿t</hi> Winds are Terrible Å¿hakers of <hi>Fruits;</hi> they beat down abundance of it, and Å¿ome times too much, and that without the leaÅ¿t diÅ¿cretion or meaÅ¿ure, either in reÅ¿pect to the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> or to Every <hi>Branch,</hi> in Å¿o much that Å¿uch years have a great Scarcity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and often to ExceÅ¿s; But yet whatever Misfortune it may have caus'd, we muÅ¿t not fail Å¿till to make a review of what is remaining, to take away Å¿uch from Å¿ome Places, which in Prudence we Judge to be overburthen'd.</p>
                        <p>But then again, thoÅ¿e FroÅ¿ts and Stormy Winds do not always happen, and then the greateÅ¿t part of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> which has knit, remains upon the <hi>Trees,</hi> and thus in the midÅ¿t of Plenty, as to Number, we may really call our Å¿elves poor as to Beauty, and goodneÅ¿s, having nothing fine enough to Honour our Culture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48210:176"/>
In Å¿uch a CaÅ¿e, I think it very proper, to eaÅ¿e Nature of a CouÅ¿iderable part of its Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, in the following manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> It is fit to tarry, until the <hi>Fruits</hi> be pretty large and well form'd, in order to take away Å¿uch as are Å¿uperabundant, and particularly to preÅ¿erve the moÅ¿t Beautiful and moÅ¿t Å¿izeable; Å¿ince that great Number conÅ¿iÅ¿ts both of good and bad, to which end we muÅ¿t commonly tarry until the end of <hi>May,</hi> and the begining of <hi>June,</hi> at which time <hi>Fruit</hi> is large enough to facilitate our Choice.</p>
                        <p>But this Picking or Culling muÅ¿t be Perform'd Å¿ooner for <hi>Apricocks</hi> than any other <hi>Fruits:</hi> Whereby we derive an advantage, which is not met with on other <hi>Trees,</hi> a very good uÅ¿e being made of Å¿mall green <hi>Apricocks,</hi> which we cannot make of other Å¿mall green <hi>Fruits,</hi> at leaÅ¿t hitherto we have not found the way of it, tho it were perhaps to be wiÅ¿h'd we might.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muÅ¿t be careful to allow every <hi>Fruit,</hi> as near as we can, as much Room as it may require, for the Å¿ize we know it is to be of, when it approaches to Maturity, and that particularly for thoÅ¿e kind of Principal Stone-<hi>Fruits,</hi> which have Å¿hort Stalks, <hi>viz. Peaches, Pavies,</hi> or <hi>Purple-Peaches, Apricocks,</hi> &amp;c. otherwiÅ¿e they would obÅ¿truct each other in growing, and it often happens that thoÅ¿e that are equally large deÅ¿troy each other, or at leaÅ¿t the Å¿trongeÅ¿t get the better, that is, the largeÅ¿t deÅ¿troys the Å¿malleÅ¿t, and thus the NouriÅ¿hment which thoÅ¿e Wretches have receiv'd during two or three Months, is loÅ¿t in vain; whereas it might have been imploy'd to advantage, had care been taken to take off Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e that were worÅ¿t plac'd betimes; for by that means thoÅ¿e that Å¿hould have been preÅ¿erv'd, would have receiv'd the benefit of the NouriÅ¿hment which was waÅ¿ted on their Neighbours.</p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that you muÅ¿t never leave thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' they are Commonly Å¿o, Å¿everal of them growing together, witneÅ¿s <hi>Apricocks,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t two and two, witneÅ¿s <hi>Peaches:</hi> For commonly the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om Buds</hi> of <hi>Peach Trees</hi> only grow two and two, both very cloÅ¿e to one another, being only divided by a Å¿mall <hi>Eye,</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> which is a Å¿mall beginning of a <hi>Branch,</hi> which Places it Å¿elf between the Two, and for the generality only Å¿hoots a few Leaves, and no <hi>Wood;</hi> but when it Å¿hoots VigorouÅ¿ly and Forms a pretty fair <hi>Branch,</hi> then there is no neceÅ¿Å¿ity of remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> which on both Å¿ides accompany the <hi>Branch;</hi> their Natural Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on keeping them at Å¿ufficient diÅ¿tance, and without doubt both of them will prove very Fine, provided nothing elÅ¿e preÅ¿s them while they are thickning, which as I have Å¿aid, muÅ¿t be carefully look'd to; but in caÅ¿e the <hi>Shoot</hi> be but weak, and Å¿lender, it muÅ¿t not hinder the removing of one of the two <hi>Peaches:</hi> Moreover, as thoÅ¿e kind of Å¿mall <hi>Shoots</hi> are commonly at a Å¿tand even in <hi>June,</hi> it is very proper to Å¿horten them at that very time to an <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> in order to Å¿ave the NouriÅ¿hment, which would be waÅ¿ted in them to no purpoÅ¿e; beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e are the <hi>Shoots</hi> which generally cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion; it will Å¿uffice to leave a Leaf or two upon each, to Å¿helter the <hi>Peach</hi> from the Heat of the Sun, and that during all the time, of it's TendereÅ¿t Infancy; Shade being Å¿o very neceÅ¿Å¿ary at that time, that without it the <hi>Peach</hi> might periÅ¿h, being uncover'd, before its being come to Å¿ome Maturity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter Pears,</hi> eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as are recommendable for the largeneÅ¿s of their Size, for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Beurre</hi> or <hi>Butter-Pears, Bon Chretiens, Virgoulee,</hi> &amp;c. do likewiÅ¿e Å¿tand in need of that Picking or culling of <hi>Fruits;</hi> by reaÅ¿on that too many of them being left together upon one Knob, they will Å¿eldom prove very fine, one will Å¿uffice upon each, or two at moÅ¿t, and even thoÅ¿e muÅ¿t appear pretty large, according to the SeaÅ¿on, and both of an equal Size, for the one being leÅ¿s than the other, will always remain Å¿o, and conÅ¿equently ill favour'd, which far from deÅ¿erving to be preÅ¿erv'd, Å¿ince it could not attain the Size it ought to have, only Å¿erves to wrong the other, which would have thriven the better had it remain'd alone upon that <hi>Bud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Summer Pears,</hi> for inÅ¿tance Å¿mall <hi>MuÅ¿cat, Robins, CaÅ¿Å¿olets, RouÅ¿Å¿elets,</hi> &amp;c. there is no Å¿uch abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿ity to Pick them, they muÅ¿t only be us'd like <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cherries;</hi> they are <hi>Fruits</hi> of an Ordinary and Regular Size, and are commonly good of all Sizes, provided they be Ripe, and not tainted by Worms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It muÅ¿t be noted, that, when the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> upon which in <hi>Pruning</hi> we have left as many <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> as we thought fit, which, as we have already noted, is always to Å¿ome Kind of exceÅ¿s; when thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> I Å¿ay, do not appear in the Month of <hi>May</hi> to receive ConÅ¿iderable Succors of new <hi>Sap,</hi> Å¿o as to thicken, or to Å¿hoot fine <hi>Branches</hi> on their extremities: In that CaÅ¿e, as I have declared more at large in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48210:176"/>
TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Pruning,</hi> we muÅ¿t not only take away a great part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> which is aready knit upon them, but even Å¿horten the <hi>Branch</hi> extreamly, and that to that part from which the fineÅ¿t <hi>Shoot</hi> proceeds; for otherwiÅ¿e certainly the beÅ¿t part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> would drop before its being Ripe, or at leaÅ¿t would remain very Å¿mall, and ConÅ¿equently bad, it being moÅ¿t certain, eÅ¿pecially as to Stone <hi>Fruit,</hi> that unleÅ¿s they approach to that Size which is proper to their kind, they never attain the delicacy they ought to have. The <hi>Peaches</hi> remain Shaggy and Green, and do not quit the Å¿tone; they are SowriÅ¿h, and BitteriÅ¿h, the <hi>Pulp</hi> is Rough and CourÅ¿e, and often Mealy, the Stone is much larger than it Å¿hould be, all which are certain Marks of an ill <hi>Peach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Pears</hi> which remain in too great a Number, are apt not only to hinder each other from thickning, but likewiÅ¿e to Rot, the Air and the Wind not having a free paÅ¿Å¿age about them; this Inconveniency is Å¿ufficient to Inform us, that part of them muÅ¿t be taken away, that the remainder may be at more Liberty and EaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>In my Opinion, it is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to ObÅ¿erve in this Place, that it is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary, eÅ¿pecially in relation to <hi>Winter Bon ChreÅ¿tien Pears,</hi> in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> which is the time in which they begin to appear Knit and <hi>Form'd,</hi> to be greatly Careful to deÅ¿troy Å¿mall Black Caterpillars which are very numorous at that SeaÅ¿on, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e would gnaw the Rind of thoÅ¿e <hi>Pears,</hi> which is the ReaÅ¿on we often meet with them crooked and uneven.</p>

                           <p>To Learn to uncover, at a proper Time, certain <hi>Fruits</hi> which require it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FRUITS</hi> being thus pick'd upon every <hi>Tree,</hi> they thicken by degrees under the Leaf, Å¿ome more, others leÅ¿s, every one according to its kind, Å¿ome Å¿ooner and others later, each according to the time Nature has deÅ¿ign'd for their Maturity; but whereas the Red, or Carnation Colour are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to certain <hi>Fruits,</hi> which may receive it, if not hinder'd, or not have it if hinder'd, (for there are Å¿ome which abÅ¿olutely can never attain it, what ever may be done, for InÅ¿tance, <hi>White Peaches, Verte Longue,</hi> or <hi>Long-Green, Green Sugar Pears, White Figs,</hi> &amp;c. there are likewiÅ¿e others, which, thonever Å¿o cover'd, ever receives the Colour of their Kind, for example <hi>Cherries, Rasberries, Strawberries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Whereas, I Å¿ay, Colour as to certain <hi>Fruits,</hi> is a very material condition, in order to render them the more valuable, and that they can never attain that Colour in Ripening, unleÅ¿s the Rays of the Sun light directly upon them, it is proper at certain times to remove Å¿ome <hi>Leaves</hi> which Å¿hade them too much, and conÅ¿equently are prejudicial to them, in relation to that Colouring; nay more, they are prejudicial as to the Maturity of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> it being moÅ¿t certain for the generality, that a <hi>Fruit,</hi> much cover'd with Leaves, cannot Ripen altogether Å¿o Å¿oon as another, which is more expos'd, and moreover has not Å¿o much delicacy.</p>
                        <p>But a great deal of Prudence and DiÅ¿cretion muÅ¿t be us'd in this caÅ¿e; and care taken not to uncover <hi>Fruits</hi> until they have almoÅ¿t attain'd their proper Å¿ize, and begin to loÅ¿e the great GreenneÅ¿s they had till then; <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to thicken from the moment they are Knit, until the beginning of <hi>June;</hi> and afterwards, as <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Å¿ay, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for a conÅ¿iderable Å¿pace in a kind of Lethargy without thickening, at leaÅ¿t ViÅ¿ibly; for I do not queÅ¿tion but they thicken a little, and that above all Å¿ome Matter enters into the InÅ¿ide of the Body of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> Å¿ince the <hi>Roots</hi> are continually preparing Å¿ome, and Å¿ending it immediately upwards; this matter indeed remains preÅ¿s'd under the Rind, which is the reaÅ¿on <hi>Fruit</hi> is Å¿o hard at that time; but finally the time which is regulated for their Maturity approaching, this very matter, tho' condens'd, begins to rarify, and to extend in few days, whereby the <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to Å¿oÅ¿ten and thicken more, and conÅ¿equently to approach to Maturity.</p>
                        <p>This is the only proper time to uncover them, at two or three different times, and that during the Å¿pace of five or Å¿ix days; for if they wereuncover'd Å¿ooner, or all at once, the great heat of the Sun would certainly occaÅ¿ion a great diÅ¿order upon that tender
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48210:177"/>
Rind, not yet accuÅ¿tom'd to the open Air; this truth is confirm'd by too many Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, when either through the Ignorance of an unskilful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or by Å¿ome unlucky FroÅ¿ts, the <hi>Fruits</hi> are uncover'd before that time; the Å¿ame cauÅ¿e which Å¿plits the Rind of <hi>Fruits,</hi> likewiÅ¿e dries up the Stalks, and ConÅ¿equently the <hi>Fruit</hi> Withers and Rots, as it happens pretty often in <hi>Vinyards,</hi> which at the beginning of <hi>Autumn,</hi> are afflicted with Å¿ome over haÅ¿tly FroÅ¿ts.</p>
                        <p>Let us return to the Colour, which is deÅ¿irable for moÅ¿t <hi>Fruits,</hi> and Å¿ay that it Imprints it Å¿elf in few days on thoÅ¿e that have been long cover'd, as it appears by <hi>Peaches, Apricocks,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially on the <hi>Quince Apples,</hi> &amp;c. and that therefore thoÅ¿e are much to blame, who neglect the procuring of Å¿o great an advantage to their <hi>Fruit,</hi> when it is Å¿o eaÅ¿ily done. Moreover, in order to render that Colour more Bright and Lively, it is not improper, to uÅ¿e a kind of Seringe made on purpoÅ¿e, with Å¿everal little holes at the end of the Spout, like thoÅ¿e of a Watering Pot, to water them twice or thrice a day, during the greateÅ¿t heat of the Sun: Such a watering Å¿oftens the Rind, and is of wonderful uÅ¿e to that end; eÅ¿pecially for <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> and it likewiÅ¿e Å¿ucceeds well for <hi>Bon Chreten Pears,</hi> and <hi>Vergoules,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>Of the Maturity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the Order Nature obÅ¿erves in it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN fine <hi>Fruits,</hi> having attain'd their Size and Colour, and the time of their Maturity being arriv'd, it behoves us to improve thoÅ¿e rich PreÅ¿ents which Nature treats us with; it is a Liberality, or rather a ProfuÅ¿ion it yearly beÅ¿tows upon us, as if it thereby delighted to recompence the Cares, and InduÅ¿try of the skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> which Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it.</p>
                        <p>Two things are to be ConÅ¿ider'd in every <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Pulp</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Pulp</hi> which is proper for the NouriÅ¿hment of Man, and the <hi>Seed</hi> which lying in the heart of that <hi>Fruit</hi> as in a Sccabberd, receives its perfection by degrees, as the <hi>Pulp</hi> makes an end of Ripening; this perfection of <hi>Seed</hi> being apparently deÅ¿ign'd for the Multiplication of the Specie of that <hi>Fruit;</hi> but this I only Å¿peak by the by, yet it appears often that the <hi>Seed</hi> is of no uÅ¿e at all.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may be urg'd in relation to that <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Fruit,</hi> that Nature Å¿eems to perform in <hi>Trees,</hi> in reÅ¿pect to its <hi>Fruits,</hi> the Å¿ame thing in part, which it performs in <hi>Animals,</hi> in relation to their Young ones; No body can be Ignorant of the extraordinary earneÅ¿tneÅ¿s of <hi>Animals</hi> to NouriÅ¿h and PreÅ¿erve their Young, and that to a certain Point, that is until they attain that perfection of Size, and Strength, which every one Å¿tands in need of, either to SubÅ¿iÅ¿t of themÅ¿elves, or to labour afterwards to perpetuate their kind at the times which Nature preÅ¿cribes</p>
                        <p>InÅ¿omuch, that till then thoÅ¿e <hi>Animals</hi> Fathers and Mothers, can hardly Å¿uffer, without reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, nay Å¿ometimes without Fury and Cruelty, any Body to touch, much leÅ¿s to take away their Young ones; but when thoÅ¿e Young ones are grown big, Nature endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring on one Å¿ide to Employ thoÅ¿e Fathers and Mothers with the Care of a new Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, and on the other hand to excite thoÅ¿e Young ones, as it were, to make a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in their kind, inclines thoÅ¿e Fathers and Mothers to abandon them, and to ceaÅ¿e NouriÅ¿hing and Protecting of them; inÅ¿omuch that thoÅ¿e Young ones being grown big, Å¿hift for themÅ¿elves, no longer looking upon the Authors of their Being, or keeping them Company, otherwiÅ¿e than as indifferent Strangers.</p>
                        <p>Thus we Å¿ee that <hi>Trees,</hi> which are really the Fathers of the <hi>Fruits,</hi> take care for a while to nouriÅ¿h thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> and to preÅ¿erve them, as if, if I may uÅ¿e the ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion, they Suckled, or Hatch'd, or Heated them with their Leaves, and that to a certoin Point, that is, until they are come to the full Perfection of their Size, and Maturity: But then, Nature Å¿eeing them in a Condition not only of SubÅ¿iÅ¿ting without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Father that has produc'd them, but likewiÅ¿e of Perpetuating and Multiplying their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, Å¿eems to withdraw the affection of the <hi>Tree;</hi> InÅ¿omuch, that before that time the <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿eems to Å¿tick cloÅ¿er to the <hi>Tree</hi> than it does afterward: But when thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> ceaÅ¿e
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48210:177"/>
to receive the wonted help, they no longer Å¿tand in need of, and Å¿ticking no longer to the <hi>Tree</hi> by the former Tye, they quit their Father and Mother, they drop, they keep aÅ¿under, and laÅ¿tly are abandon'd to themÅ¿elves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Pulp</hi> of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> it is to be Noted, that the degree which approaches neareÅ¿t to what we call RotteneÅ¿s, (which is their deÅ¿truction,) is the perfection of their Maturity, inÅ¿omuch, that they are never perfectly good to Eat, until being abÅ¿olutely Ripe, they are near Å¿poiling.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, unleÅ¿s the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> be careful to gather his <hi>Fruits,</hi> and make uÅ¿e of them, when they are entirely Ripe, he will be in danger of Å¿eeing them periÅ¿h, Å¿ome through a RotteneÅ¿s, which begins at firÅ¿t in Å¿ome part of the Body, as it happens with moÅ¿t <hi>Apples,</hi> and others by growing Mealy, as <hi>Peaches,</hi> Å¿ome by growing Soft firÅ¿t, as many <hi>Pears</hi> do, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as are Tender, as <hi>Butter-Pears,</hi> others by growing Dry and Shaggy, as moÅ¿t <hi>MuÅ¿c-Pears</hi> do; all which are different ways Conducing to RotteneÅ¿s and DeÅ¿truction. When this happens, Man is Subject to Å¿ome inward checks of Nature, which Å¿eems to reproach him for his not having been Capable of Improving her Liberalities towards him.</p>
                        <p>It might be queÅ¿tion'd in this Place what Maturity is, and how it is perform'd, both which queÅ¿tions are pretty agreeable, but of no great uÅ¿e to a <hi>Gard'ner. FirÅ¿t,</hi> as to the Definition of Maturity, perhaps conÅ¿idering the great Proximity between it and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, we can hardly give a better, than to Å¿ay, that it is a beginning of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The Truth is, that in Å¿peaking of a thing which paÅ¿Å¿es for a Perfection, it Å¿eems pretty odd to make uÅ¿e of a Term, which expreÅ¿Å¿es defect, and is really diÅ¿guÅ¿ting; but then to Å¿often the Å¿ignification of that ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion, it will Å¿uffice to Å¿ay, that there are Å¿everal degrees of Corruption; many <hi>Fruits</hi> are Corrupted and Rotten, without ever having been Ripe, which Corruption is a real defect, without the leaÅ¿t Perfection. On the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there are other <hi>Fruits,</hi> which never begin to Corrupt unleÅ¿s they have attain'd the utmoÅ¿t degree of Perfect Maturity, which Corrupion is really a defect for the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but is at the Å¿ame time a Perfection for the Eater: Thus we may Å¿ay, that a Piece of <hi>Wood</hi> which becomes a Circle, receives a degree of Corruption in relation to it Å¿elf, Å¿ince it ceaÅ¿es to have the Figure which Nature had given it, but it receives a Perfection in relation to the Workman, who forces it to take that bend, which it Å¿tands in need of for his uÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>As to the manner, how Maturity is perform'd, the difficulty is much greater, and more puzling; for tho the Sun Å¿hining directly upon the <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿eems the only Author of the Maturity, of the <hi>Summer Fruits,</hi> by means of the <hi>Air,</hi> to which it has given a proper degree of Heat; yet we cannot Å¿ay in general, that it is the only and laÅ¿t Author of the perfect Maturity of all manner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> Å¿ince thoÅ¿e which are gather'd without being Ripe, Ripen of themÅ¿elves in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> where the Sun no longer Å¿hines directly upon them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it will be more proper and more likely to Å¿ay, that the Sun indeed begins the Maturity of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> which remain upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> to a certain degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, without which the <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿hrink and Å¿poil, without having enjoy'd the benefit of the real way of a good Maturity, and that after this the greateÅ¿t Crudity having been thus conÅ¿um'd by the Heat of the Sun, as all Natural Bodies are Subject to Corrupt, Å¿ome Å¿ooner, others later; one part of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> arrive at laÅ¿t to the Period of their ExiÅ¿tance, which often proves the Point of an agreeable Maturity; another part likewiÅ¿e meets its end in a precipitated RottenneÅ¿s, which may proceed either from too much Cold, or too much Heat, or too much MoiÅ¿ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We might likewiÅ¿e PleaÅ¿e our Å¿elves with asking, whether thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are Å¿ooneÅ¿t Ripe, are better for the Health of Man, than thoÅ¿e which are longer before they attain their Maturity. The like queÅ¿tion might be made, as to thoÅ¿e that are Perfum'd, and thoÅ¿e that are not; Å¿uch as have <hi>Kernels,</hi> and Å¿uch as have <hi>Stones, &amp;c.</hi> But whereas thoÅ¿e Gallantries are of no uÅ¿e to the matter in hand, I Å¿hall Wave them, and proceed to the InÅ¿tructions that are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, in order to learn to gather <hi>Fruits</hi> SeaÅ¿onably, without loÅ¿ing my Time in needleÅ¿s PhiloÅ¿ophy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> Then, Care muÅ¿t be taken to underÅ¿tand that Maturity rightly, as alÅ¿o that not only every kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> has a time, or regulated SeaÅ¿on for its Maturity, but likewiÅ¿e that of every Particular <hi>Fruit</hi> in its SeaÅ¿on, Å¿ome have as it were, about Week to be good in, and no more, as the <hi>RouÅ¿Å¿elets</hi> or <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿etins, Beurre</hi> or <hi>Butter-Pears, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamets, Verte-Longue</hi> or <hi>Long-Green,</hi> &amp;c. others not above a Day or two, and nothing beyond it, as <hi>Figs, Cherries,</hi> moÅ¿t <hi>Peaches, &amp;c.</hi> Å¿ome have a great deal longer, as <hi>Grapes,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48210:178"/>
Apples,</hi> and moÅ¿t <hi>Winter Fruits,</hi> for InÅ¿tance, an <hi>Apple</hi> or <hi>Bon ChreÅ¿tien Pear,</hi> will be good to Eat for a Month or Å¿ix Weeks together.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it muÅ¿t be Noted, that every kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> has its peculiar marks of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, either Å¿uch as Ripen upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or Å¿uch as only Ripen Å¿ome time after their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gather'd.</p>
                        <p>Altho Generally the Common time of Maturity of every kind, is within the CompaÅ¿s of the knowledg and underÅ¿tanding of Common <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who commonly are pretty able to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h which are <hi>Summer,</hi> which <hi>Autumn,</hi> and which <hi>Winter Fruits, &amp;c.</hi> Yet it is certain that the Å¿ingular Marks of the Maturity of every <hi>Fruit</hi> in particular, to take them in the very nick of time, that is, the preciÅ¿e time of their Maturity, thoÅ¿e Marks, I Å¿ay, are properly reÅ¿erv'd for the knowledg of a Gentleman who will uÅ¿e Å¿ome Application a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, without which nothing is more Common than to Å¿ee <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿erv'd, either before their being Ripe, that is before they are good, or elÅ¿e paÅ¿s'd <hi>Fruits,</hi> that is, too Ripe, and ConÅ¿equently nought, and that at a time too, when without doubt, there are others, which having attain'd a juÅ¿t Maturity might Å¿upply the Room of thoÅ¿e, and which for want of being us'd at that time, have the misfortune to loÅ¿e their Delicacy, and the Value they deÅ¿erv'd.</p>
                        <p>One would think that there were but little to be Å¿aid upon the Subject of this Maturity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and yet the extream Application I have us'd about it for a long while, has cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd me of the Contrary. And whereas all the Expence, all the Care, and all the Pains People have been at, to get <hi>Fruit,</hi> would prove vain, if having CompaÅ¿s'd it, they were Å¿till at a loÅ¿s, not knowing how to make the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I have already fully Explain'd in the TreatiÅ¿e of the Choice and Proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are the <hi>Fruits</hi> not only of every SeaÅ¿on, but even thoÅ¿e which are of every Month, Å¿o that perhaps it would be tireÅ¿ome and needleÅ¿s to Repeat it here; Å¿o that the only thing in QueÅ¿tion now is, to give a true Explication of what Relates to the Particulars of the Maturity of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> and if PoÅ¿Å¿ible to give the World a greater InÅ¿ight into that Knowledg, than it has had hitherto.</p>
                        <p>Above all things, I would have an Ingenious <hi>Gard'ner</hi> Å¿o well Skill'd in that Point, as never to PreÅ¿ent any of his <hi>Fruits,</hi> EÅ¿pecially of thoÅ¿e that are Tender and Mellow, as <hi>Peaches, Figs, Plums,</hi> or <hi>Pears,</hi> unleÅ¿s they were in a juÅ¿t degree of Maturity, in Å¿o much that thoÅ¿e they are preÅ¿ented to, may take the very firÅ¿t, without the leaÅ¿t fear of being DiÅ¿appointed, or at leaÅ¿t may be able to chuÅ¿e with the Eye, without being reduc'd to Picking, and Squeezing, that is to Å¿poil the <hi>Fruit,</hi> before they can meet with any to their liking.</p>
                        <p>My Intention is, that this Picking and Squeezing, which hitherto may have been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, or Tollerable, Å¿hall no longer be allowable, unleÅ¿s it be at the <hi>Tavern,</hi> or among ordinary People, and Å¿uch as have little or no nicety, or elÅ¿e Å¿uch as have no <hi>Fruit</hi> but what they Buy at the <hi>Market:</hi> And even there I would not have thoÅ¿e Squeezers, Squeeze any where but near the Stalk, and that gently too, Sticking to the firÅ¿t which yields to the Thumb, to the End that one Part only may be tainted by this Squeezing (which occaÅ¿ions a beginning of RottenneÅ¿s) beÅ¿ides they may aÅ¿Å¿ure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, that whatever <hi>Fruit</hi> is Ripe near the Stalk, is Å¿ufficiently Å¿o every where.</p>
                        <p>One of the moÅ¿t ConÅ¿iderable Defects I am to Combat here, is the Precipitation wherewith I obÅ¿erve moÅ¿t of the Curious are inclin'd, to begin betimes to CauÅ¿e the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every SeaÅ¿on to be Eaten; nothing is more Common than to Å¿ee that when People have begun ill, they continue during all the SeaÅ¿on to Eat their <hi>Fruit</hi> ill Condition'd, by reaÅ¿on that as Naturally the deÅ¿ire of Eating <hi>Fruit</hi> continues from the Moment we have begun to do it, it commonly happens, that in gathering the Second or Third time we commit the Å¿ame Fault we had been guilty of at the FirÅ¿t; whereas if we tarry to Eat thoÅ¿e that are in SeaÅ¿on until we have a Å¿ufficient quantity Ripe to give, we have ever after the Å¿atisfaction of Eating none but Å¿uch as are incomparably good.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I adviÅ¿e all <hi>Gard'ners</hi> never to begin gathering until there be a viÅ¿ible Appearance of a happy Continuance.</p>
                        <p>I am likewiÅ¿e to Combat another great Defect, of Å¿ome of the Curious, which is Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never to Å¿erve any <hi>Fruits</hi> until they be paÅ¿s'd, the Number of thoÅ¿e is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable: Their fear of its not laÅ¿ting long enough, or of not having enough for Å¿ome occaÅ¿ion or other, or rather their Ignorance in point of Maturity, occaÅ¿ions all this diÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Therefore I will Endeavour to Remedy thoÅ¿e two Defects.</p>

But firÅ¿t, I cannot forbear to admire, in this place, the Providence of Nature, not only in what relates to the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of that Maturity, which we Å¿ee in relation to every kind of <hi>Fruit,</hi> commonly to make the one Ripen in one SeaÅ¿on, and the other in another; but alÅ¿o in what relates to the Order of the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Maturity of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> in particular, which it conducts to Maturity by degrees; as if it really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to allow Man, for the NouriÅ¿hment of whom it Å¿eems to have produc'd them, time to conÅ¿ume them all, without Å¿uffering any to periÅ¿h: And, indeed, it is obÅ¿ervable, that Nature likewiÅ¿e obÅ¿erves the Å¿ame Order for the forming, and the opening of the <hi>BloÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oms</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> which produce <hi>Fruit,</hi> as it does for <hi>Plants</hi> which only produce <hi>Flowers;</hi> for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Hiacints, TuberoÅ¿es, Carnations,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Buds</hi> whereof only open by degrees, as if deÅ¿ign'd thereby, the longer to delight the SenÅ¿es of Humane Creatures.</p>
                        <p>In effect, tho' every <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> does not commonly laÅ¿t above four or five days in its perfection, yet every <hi>Tree</hi> appears in <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> for a Fortnight, or three Weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which certainly proceeds from that the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> are Originally form'd, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards open one after another; thoÅ¿e that are form'd firÅ¿t, open firÅ¿t, as thoÅ¿e that <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> firÅ¿t, have the advantage of producing thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> which ripen firÅ¿t; thus the Å¿econd and third <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> which are like Å¿o many younger SiÅ¿ters, Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively form'd after the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Å¿eem to perfect themÅ¿elves, while thoÅ¿e delight our Eyes; thoÅ¿e Å¿econd, and third <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> I Å¿ay, in imitation of a well-regulated Family, are not to open, and Å¿hew themÅ¿elves, until the Elders have had their Career; Å¿o that thoÅ¿e Elder fading, in order to produce the firÅ¿t <hi>Fruits</hi> of their SeaÅ¿on, the young ones appear, to form thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> which are to be the Å¿econd, and third, in Ripening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although we have obÅ¿erv'd in every <hi>Tree</hi> an order in the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Maturity of the <hi>Fruits,</hi> in relation to each other; we do not find this Å¿ame Order of SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity obÅ¿erv'd for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of another <hi>Tree,</hi> of a certain kind, in reÅ¿pect to the <hi>Fruits</hi> of another <hi>Tree,</hi> which is of another certain kind, whether both have <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om'd</hi> at one and the Å¿ame time, or whether the one have <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om'd</hi> Å¿ooner, the other later: For inÅ¿tance, all <hi>Peach-Trees BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> at the Å¿ame time, and yet Å¿ome <hi>Peaches</hi> Ripen about the middle of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and others do not Ripen 'till towards the end of <hi>October;</hi> and likewiÅ¿e other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Pear, Apple,</hi> or <hi>Plum-Trees BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> almoÅ¿t all in one and the Å¿ame Month, and yet that kind which <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> firÅ¿t, does not always Ripen firÅ¿t; Nature Orders it otherwiÅ¿e, which I can give no ReaÅ¿on for: The <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> for InÅ¿tance, is the firÅ¿t that <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> and almoÅ¿t the laÅ¿t which comes to Maturity.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as it is moÅ¿t certain, that <hi>Fruits</hi> ripen one after another, Å¿o it is likewiÅ¿e true, that, as <hi>Aurora</hi> UÅ¿hers in, or declares the coming of the Sun, Å¿o the Maturity of <hi>Fruits</hi> is declar'd, or preceeded by Å¿ome particular marks, the knowledge of which, I have made it my buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to Å¿tudy; and I am of Opinion, that I Å¿hall oblige the Curious, by acquainting them with my ObÅ¿ervations.</p>
                        <p>'Tis certainly very difficult to be very exact as to the preciÅ¿e time of the juÅ¿t maturity of <hi>Fruits:</hi> Nothing is Å¿o common as to be deceiv'd therein, as we have already declar'd, either in gathering them too Å¿oon, or too late; beÅ¿ides, there are Å¿ome in which the Point of Maturity is Å¿o momentary, as the white <hi>Butter-Pear,</hi> the <hi>Maudlin-Pear,</hi> the <hi>DoyeinnÃ©,</hi> the <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Andilly, &amp;c.</hi> that whatever Care be taken, it is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to hit that Point of Maturity exactly, it paÅ¿Å¿es Å¿o Å¿wiftly, when once 'tis come; neither am I fond of having many of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As nothing is more delightful than to eat well-condition'd <hi>Fruits,</hi> nothing can be more diÅ¿agreeable than to eat them green, or over-ripe: Not but in my Opinion, this laÅ¿t defect is leÅ¿s tolerable than the firÅ¿t, by reaÅ¿on that all <hi>Fruit</hi> that is over-ripe, far from having any taÅ¿t, is commonly inÅ¿ipid, and mealy; whereas <hi>Fruit</hi> that is not quite ripe enough, though on the one Å¿ide it may Å¿et the Teeth on edge, yet on the other it diÅ¿covers part of its Vertue, by the briskneÅ¿s of its taÅ¿t, and by its <hi>Pulp</hi> drawing near perfection; moÅ¿t Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this, will be of my Opinion.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, as in this particular CaÅ¿e of Maturity we have two Å¿orts of <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which, the one are good, from the moment they are gather'd; for inÅ¿tance, all Stone <hi>Fruits,</hi> Å¿ome Summer-<hi>Pears,</hi> and all Red-<hi>Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. it follows, that none of thoÅ¿e Å¿hould be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd until they be ripe, by reaÅ¿on, that how little time Å¿oever their Maturity may laÅ¿t, they preÅ¿erve themÅ¿elves much better, and longer upon the <hi>Stock</hi> than they would do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gather'd: There are other <hi>Fruits</hi> which are only good Å¿ometime after their being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd; for Example, moÅ¿t Kernel-<hi>Fruits</hi> that are Mellow, and conÅ¿tantly all Autumn, and Winter-<hi>Fruits.</hi> In Order to give true Rules to underÅ¿tand the Maturity of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I think it will not be improper to begin here with thoÅ¿e that are fit to be eaten as Å¿oon as gather'd; I Å¿hall not mention the others, until I come to the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es,</hi> or <hi>Fruit-Rooms.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>How to judge of the Maturity and GoodneÅ¿s of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THree of our SenÅ¿es have the gift of judging of the appearances of the Maturity of <hi>Fruits, Viz.</hi> Sight, Feeling for the moÅ¿t part, and Smelling for Å¿ome, I Å¿ay only to judge of the appearances, for the TaÅ¿t is the only and real Judge to whom it belongs to Judge Solidly, and without appeal, as well of the Maturity, as of the GoodneÅ¿s, it is Å¿ufficiently known that there are Å¿ome <hi>Fruits</hi> which are neither good nor agreeable to the Pallat, tho' actually ripe.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes one SenÅ¿e alone is Å¿ufficient, to Judge certainly of the appearances, and even of the reality; for inÅ¿tance, the <hi>Eye</hi> alone Å¿uffices for all Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> and for <hi>Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. it Judges with certainty of the RipeneÅ¿s of a <hi>Cherry,</hi> a <hi>Strawberry,</hi> a <hi>RaÅ¿pberry,</hi> a Bunch of Red, or Black <hi>Grapes;</hi> when both the one and the other are all over Painted with that fine Colour, which is natural to them: And on the contrary, when any part does want it, the <hi>Eye</hi> thereby judges, that it is an infallible Mark, that all the reÅ¿t is not yet arriv'd to its juÅ¿t Maturity.</p>
                        <p>So likewiÅ¿e, Feeling alone judges very well of the apparent and effective Maturity of Tender Mellow <hi>Pears,</hi> whatever they be; Å¿o that even the Blind are as able to judge of it by feeling, as the moÅ¿t clear Sighted, both by Å¿eeing, and touching.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to imploy two of our SenÅ¿es, Seeing, and Feeling, barely to Judge of the appearance of Maturity; for Example, for <hi>Figs, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> and even <hi>Apricocks,</hi> it not being Å¿ufficient for a <hi>Peach</hi> to appear ripe upon the <hi>Tree</hi> by its Beautiful Colour, red on the one Å¿ide, and yellowiÅ¿h on the other, thereby to judge that it is fit for gathering; neither does it Å¿uffice after their being gather'd, for them to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Stalks, beÅ¿ides this fine Colouring, though commonly it is a good Mark, the Stalk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Å¿ticking to thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits,</hi> until their being ripe, at which time the <hi>Fruit</hi> quits it with eaÅ¿e, and the Stalk remains fix'd to the <hi>Tree;</hi> but whereas this <hi>Stalk</hi> may have been Å¿ever'd violently, their appearing without a <hi>Stalk,</hi> may chance to prove a falÅ¿e Mark of Maturity.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e Signs alone, as to thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I Å¿ay are not Å¿ufficient, to Judge abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely by the <hi>Eye</hi> of their Maturity, the Hand muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e act its part, and concur therein, tho' not to touch it roughly upon the <hi>Tree</hi> (nothing is more offenÅ¿ive to me than thoÅ¿e Gropers, who, to gather one according to their Mind, will Å¿poil a hundred by the violent impreÅ¿Å¿ion of their Unskillful Thumb) but I would have the Hand play its part in the manner I Å¿hall explain hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The Hand muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be us'd for a <hi>Peach</hi> that is ready gather'd, when we are not certain it was gather'd by a Skillful Hand, but then it muÅ¿t be perform'd very gently, and that, as I have already Å¿aid, near the <hi>Stalk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In caÅ¿e it be a <hi>Fig,</hi> whether gather'd, or not, it is allowable to touch it gently with the end of the Finger, almoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame manner as a Chyrurgeon feels for the Vein in order to Bleed; for in caÅ¿e that <hi>Fig,</hi> after having appear'd to the Eye of a yellowiÅ¿h Colour, a Å¿hrivel'd <hi>Rind,</hi> with Å¿ome Crannies, the Head hanging down, and the Body Å¿hrunk, likewiÅ¿e appears very Mellow under the Finger, and that being Å¿till upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> may be looÅ¿en'd by the leaÅ¿t motion, it is very Å¿it for gathering, and without doubt ripe, and good: But if, notwithÅ¿tanding all thoÅ¿e fine appearances, and all this MyÅ¿tery, it does not eaÅ¿ily quit the <hi>Tree,</hi> the gathering of it muÅ¿t be deferr'd for Å¿ome days, it is never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, while it reÅ¿iÅ¿ts in gathering.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Fig</hi> having all the good Marks of Maturity, has been gather'd by a Skillful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and is afterwards preÅ¿ented to any body, they may freely, and without any rough feeling, judge it to be fit to receive, and eat.</p>
                        <p>We may Å¿ay the Å¿ame thing of a <hi>Plum</hi> ready gather'd, that is, that if beÅ¿ides the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Colour it ought to have, which Å¿atisfies the Eye, and the MellowneÅ¿s which Skillful Fingers have diÅ¿cover'd, without offering it any violence, it proves without a Stalk, being a little Å¿hrivel'd, and wither'd on that Å¿ide; it may be inferr'd from thence, that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ripe, and conÅ¿equently fit to take.</p>
                        <p>LikewiÅ¿e if this <hi>Plum</hi> being Å¿till upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> finely Colour'd for the Eye, and Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the Finger, comes off with eaÅ¿e, without a <hi>Stalk,</hi> it is without doubt fully ripe, but if not, like the <hi>Fig,</hi> itmuÅ¿t be left Å¿ome days longer upon the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>

Two things may be inferr'd from this remark about the <hi>Stalk,</hi> the firÅ¿t is, that it muÅ¿t not Å¿tick to Å¿ome kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> when they are ripe; for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Peaches, Plums, Straw-berries, RaÅ¿pberries, &amp;c.</hi> inÅ¿omuch that none of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿hould be eaten, while the <hi>Stalk</hi> Å¿ticks cloÅ¿e to them; and the Å¿econd, that it may, and ought to Å¿tick to others, tho' never Å¿o ripe; for Example, to <hi>Figs, Cherries, Pears, Apples,</hi> &amp;c. to which, the <hi>Stalks</hi> Å¿erve as an agreeable Ornament, and their being without it, would be a kind of Defect.</p>
                        <p>After having demonÅ¿trated, that in Å¿ome <hi>Fruits,</hi> for Example, Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> the Eye alone is Å¿ufficient to judge of their Maturity, and in others, as Tender Mellow <hi>Pears,</hi> the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only; as alÅ¿o that Å¿ome others require both Seeing, and Feeling, <hi>Viz. Peaches, Plums, Figs, &amp;c.</hi> we may add, that there are Å¿till Å¿ome others in which Smelling may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with Sight, in order to Judge with more certainty, for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Melons,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving approv'd their Colour, Stalk, and Beautiful Figure, and examin'd their PonderouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, it is not improper to Å¿mell to them before we cut them, to be able, as 'tis thought, thereby to judge with more certainty of their Maturity, and GoodneÅ¿s, tho' at the Å¿ame time I am convinc'd, that thoÅ¿e which have the beÅ¿t Å¿cent, or Å¿avour, are not commonly the beÅ¿t: This Maxim is Å¿ufficiently well eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd.</p>
                        <p>But, in fine, generally Å¿peaking, all the Marks above explain'd, to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may chance not to be certain, and infallible; they are Exteriour Signs, which might be term'd Signs of PhiÅ¿iognomy, and ConÅ¿equently deceitful, Å¿omething more is neceÅ¿Å¿ary in this CaÅ¿e, it requires matter of Fact; and therefore, as we have already declar'd, TaÅ¿t only can decide in this Point; and, if I may uÅ¿e that ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion, that only can affix the Seal, and the Character of an abÅ¿olute Decree, as a Judgment, which is to be Pronounc'd, particularly in the CaÅ¿e of GoodneÅ¿s; for let the Exteriour Marks be never Å¿o fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, unleÅ¿s the <hi>Peach, Plum,</hi> and <hi>Melon</hi> pleaÅ¿e the Pallat, after having pleas'd the other SenÅ¿es, as it happens Å¿ometimes, all the Preliminaries are uÅ¿eleÅ¿s; therefore we muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit all to the Pallat, however with this Å¿cruple, which I cannot remove, for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of real goodneÅ¿s, which is, that TaÅ¿ts are very different in themÅ¿elves, and that a thing which may pleaÅ¿e one Man's Pallat, may diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e another's: But this diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion is out of my Province; the Ancient Maxim <hi>(de GuÅ¿tibus)</hi> forbids my med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it, and thus I can only Å¿peak of my own in particular, and at the Å¿ame time applaud thoÅ¿e who have the good Fortune of liking that which does not Å¿eem good to me: It would be Ridiculous in me to endeavour diÅ¿abuÅ¿ing of them, Å¿ince probably I Å¿hou'd only loÅ¿e my labour.</p>

                           <hi>Fruits</hi> Ripen Å¿ooner, or later, firÅ¿t, according as the Months of <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May</hi> are more or leÅ¿s warm, to cauÅ¿e the <hi>Trees</hi> to <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> or <hi>Knit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, according as thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> grow againÅ¿t a good Wall, or good Shelter, that is, expos'd to the <hi>South,</hi> or <hi>EaÅ¿t;</hi> and, in fine, particularly according as they are in a hot Climate, and light Earth.</p>
                        <p>All which ConÅ¿iderations are very material for the forwardneÅ¿s of <hi>Fruits;</hi> for the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> proving hot, the <hi>Fruits</hi> knitting the Å¿ooner, they will conÅ¿equently ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Å¿ooner; witneÅ¿s the maturity of <hi>Melons,</hi> which is an undeniable Truth; <hi>Fruits</hi> being, as it were, in reÅ¿pect to their Maturity, like Bread, in reÅ¿pect to its being Bak'd the Å¿ooner, or later, according to the time of its being put into the Oven.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Fruits,</hi> tho' knit betimes, are in the open Air, or only againÅ¿t Å¿ome Walls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> or <hi>North, &amp;c.</hi> they will advance but little, for want of the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the heats of the Spring, and likewiÅ¿e, if notwithÅ¿tanding the advantage of a pretty hot SeaÅ¿on, and happy expoÅ¿ure, they are in a Cold Climate, nay, tho' in a moderate Clime, the Earth being CourÅ¿e, and conÅ¿equently Cold, they will not ripen Å¿o Å¿oon, as thoÅ¿e which have all things favourable.</p>
                        <p>For Example, all manner of <hi>Fruits</hi> ripen Å¿ooner, in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> which are hot <hi>Soils,</hi> than in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris,</hi> and even in thoÅ¿e parts of <hi>Paris Fruits</hi> Ripen much Å¿ooner within the City it Å¿elf, and in the Subburbs of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and St.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48210:180"/>
                           <hi>Germans,</hi> as well as at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> at <hi>MaiÅ¿ons, Carriere, &amp;c.</hi> where the <hi>Earth</hi> is light, and hot, than they do at <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> where the <hi>Ground</hi> is cold, and courÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>All thoÅ¿e places are too near one another, to impute thoÅ¿e differences in point of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Sun; beÅ¿ides, there is a difference between the immediate heat of the Sun in reÅ¿pect to the maturity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the immediate heat of the Fire, in reÅ¿pect to the Meat it RoÅ¿ts, or Boils, Fire firÅ¿t affecting the Exteriour parts of the Meat which are neareÅ¿t to it, before it performs its Function on the inÅ¿ide, which is at more diÅ¿tance; whereas the Sun Ripens the inward parts, before the Exteriour; in effect, the inward part of <hi>Fruits</hi> always Ripens firÅ¿t, and Å¿often firÅ¿t, and likewiÅ¿e commonly is the Å¿ooneÅ¿t Å¿poil'd.</p>
                        <p>If I may be allow'd to declare the ReaÅ¿on which to me Å¿eems moÅ¿t plauÅ¿ible in this Point, I Å¿hall Å¿ay, in the firÅ¿t place, that Maturity proceeds from two CauÅ¿es, the one near and immediate, which is the heated Air, the other not indirect, and diÅ¿tant, and that is the Sun which heats that Air; Å¿o that the Function of the Sun is to heat the Air as much as the Winds will allow; and the Function of the Air Å¿o heated, is to impart its heat to the Earth, and Å¿o to all the <hi>Plants;</hi> this <hi>Earth</hi> thus heated, cauÅ¿es firÅ¿t the Principle of Life which lies near the <hi>Root</hi> to Act, and then the <hi>Root</hi> it Å¿elf, which conÅ¿equently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <hi>Sap</hi> as Å¿oon as it is put in Action; and that <hi>Sap,</hi> at the Å¿ame time, riÅ¿es to perform its Function into all the Superiour parts, where it can penetrate.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd place, I Å¿hall Å¿ay, that the Air of every Climate is in probability compos'd, or at leaÅ¿t conÅ¿iderably mix'd with the Vapours, and Exhalations which riÅ¿e from the <hi>Earth</hi> of that Climate, which in my Opinion, is the ReaÅ¿on of Peoples Å¿aying, that the Air of Å¿uch a Country is good, and the Air of Å¿uch another is bad.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I Å¿hall Å¿ay, that it follows from thence, that that Air is more or leÅ¿s eaÅ¿ie to be heated, according as the <hi>Earth,</hi> from which thoÅ¿e Vapours riÅ¿e, is more or leÅ¿s cold, and material; for thoÅ¿e Vapours participate altogether to the Nature of that <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore that as in light <hi>Earths</hi> the Air Å¿ooner receives the impreÅ¿Å¿ion of heat, by reaÅ¿on of its being form'd by more Å¿ubtle Vapours, it conÅ¿equently the Å¿ooner heats both that <hi>Earth,</hi> and the whole Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and the <hi>Plant</hi> it nouriÅ¿hes; which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that it is the <hi>Roots</hi> being Å¿ooner heated at Å¿uch times, and in Å¿uch <hi>Earth,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently the <hi>Saps</hi> being Å¿ooner prepar'd, which form inwardly in thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> the firÅ¿t degrees of Maturity.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is certain, that the Air, according to its being more or leÅ¿s thick, is alÅ¿o more or leÅ¿s apt to receive heat; and that according to its degrees of heat, it either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, or does not advance Maturity, as it has advanc'd, or not advanc'd the heat of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore the forwardneÅ¿s, or backwardneÅ¿s of Maturity, depends on the Conditions above explain'd, in Å¿o muuch, that they muÅ¿t all Combine; that is, that <hi>Fruit</hi> in order to Ripen betimes, muÅ¿t Knit betimes; and next, muÅ¿t meet with a favourable <hi>ExpoÅ¿ure,</hi> a hot Clime, and light <hi>Earth.</hi>

                        <p>ACcording to the Natural Order of the Maturity of <hi>Fruits</hi> of every SeaÅ¿on, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ElderÅ¿hip certainly belongs to early <hi>Cherries,</hi> and next to <hi>Strawberries, RaÅ¿pberries,</hi> and <hi>Goosberries, &amp;c.</hi> The firÅ¿t commonly begin to appear in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and that a little Å¿ooner, or a little later, according as the Conditions we have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, are more or leÅ¿s favourable: <hi>Strawberries</hi> begin to <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> or a little before, in good Situations, and in cold places, not before the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> and happily, none of thoÅ¿e Å¿mall FroÅ¿ts which are apt to blacken, and Å¿poil thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> intervening, Ripe <hi>Strawberries</hi> may be expected at a Months end: And as for early <hi>Cherries</hi> that have <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om'd</hi> about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> we may expect to have them about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> not altogether Ripe, but half Red, with which Colour they may Å¿erve as well, as if they had attain'd a full Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, Å¿ince they are only conÅ¿iderable, and valued for their Novelty, eÅ¿pecially by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48210:180"/>
for after all, at that time it is only a little colour'd Cloak, which only Å¿erves to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a little Å¿ower <hi>Pulp,</hi> and a large Stone; and therefore they Å¿tand in need of the aÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of a Confectioner, to require an Excellency, which the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or rather the Sun has not had time to afford them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Trees</hi> of a pretty Cold Climate <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> almoÅ¿t as Å¿oon as thoÅ¿e of a Climate that is Å¿omewhat hotter, by ReaÅ¿on that the opening of thoÅ¿e <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> Å¿eems to be perform'd independantly from the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> witneÅ¿s the <hi>Branches</hi> that <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> being Cut, (the bare force of the Rarefaction caus'd in the <hi>Bud,</hi> by the preÅ¿ence of the firÅ¿t Rays of the Sun, is capable of producing this Effect) but as for the maturity of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> it can only be perform'd, and perfected; FirÅ¿t, by a great Concurrency of the Operation of the <hi>Roots,</hi> and Secondly, by a certain degree of Heat in the Air, which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Perfection of that MaÅ¿ter-piece: Now this Heat, both in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and in the Air, can only proceed regularly from the Rays of the Sun; and yet I dare affirm, that I have been Å¿o happy as to imitate it in little for Å¿ome Å¿mall <hi>Fruits;</hi> I have made Å¿ome to Ripen five or Å¿ix Weeks before their time; for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Strawberries</hi> at the end of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>PeaÅ¿e</hi> in <hi>April, Figs</hi> in <hi>June, AÅ¿paragus,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage-Lettuce</hi> in <hi>December, January,</hi> &amp;c. But we can find no <hi>facilitations</hi> to imitate this Heat in Great, to cauÅ¿e the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Large <hi>Trees</hi> to Ripen in an extraordinary manner; therefore it is apparent, that tho' Nature has abandon'd the <hi>Earth</hi> to us, leaving it in our Power to Heat Å¿ome Portion thereof, to make it produce againÅ¿t its will, by means of a Foreign borrow'd Heat, what we have a mind to; has, notwithÅ¿tanding, reÅ¿erv'd to it Å¿elf in a particular manner, the UniverÅ¿al Faculty of the maturity of <hi>Fruits;</hi> this maturity in relation to us, is the FiniÅ¿her, and Perfection of the production of the <hi>Earth;</hi> in Å¿o much, that without it, all our Cares and InduÅ¿try for the generality, only afford us Å¿ome hopes, which often prove falÅ¿e, and deluding.</p>
                        <p>I have Å¿aid heretofore, that we may begin to have Å¿ome early <hi>Cherries,</hi> in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> thoÅ¿e Å¿mall <hi>Fruits</hi> have an open Field at that Time, they are the only that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> and that grace our Tables; they are Rival'd by no others until the end of the Month, which is the time of the diÅ¿playing or opening the Grand Magazine of the other Red <hi>Fruits;</hi> and theÅ¿e remain in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion until the end of <hi>June,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of <hi>July;</hi> for the early <hi>Cherries</hi> which Å¿eldom appear but in <hi>China-DiÅ¿hes,</hi> and in Å¿mall quantity, are follow'd cloÅ¿e by <hi>Strawberries,</hi> with this difference; that theÅ¿e, to endear themÅ¿elves the more, above the <hi>Cherries</hi> that have preceeded them, appear with a Charming Å¿cent, and in prodigious quantity; that is, in full BaÅ¿ons, and would think themÅ¿elves diÅ¿grac'd to appear as poorly attended, as their PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors.</p>
                        <p>Among theÅ¿e <hi>Strawberries</hi> Å¿ome are Red, and others White, the laÅ¿t are Å¿eldom Ripe until they are grown yellowiÅ¿h, and the others are never good, until they are perfectly and UniverÅ¿ally Red; and neither of them are eatable, until they have attain'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable Å¿ize.</p>
                        <p>I may Å¿ay by the by, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Strawberries</hi> that are Å¿ooneÅ¿t Ripe, are thoÅ¿e that have <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om'd</hi> firÅ¿t, and that thoÅ¿e that are neareÅ¿t to the body of the <hi>Plant,</hi> are thoÅ¿e that <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om'd</hi> firÅ¿t; I will draw Å¿ome InÅ¿tructions in the <hi>TreatiÅ¿e</hi> of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> in order to our getting of them always Finer, Larger, and Better, from that part, than otherwiÅ¿e we Å¿hould do.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Strawberries</hi> that grow Naturally, and of themÅ¿elves, which moÅ¿t People are fond of, are accompany'd towards the middle of <hi>June</hi> with Red and White <hi>RaÅ¿pberries, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Hearts,</hi> and Plain <hi>Cherries,</hi> of which, Å¿ome are Å¿omewhat earlier, and not Å¿o good; others later, which are larger, and Å¿weeter, and better, either PreÅ¿erv'd, or Raw: <hi>Bigar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaux</hi> alÅ¿o come in among them, and even <hi>Morrello</hi>'s, but commonly they both tarry until the hurry of Red <hi>Fruits</hi> is Å¿omewhat over; not but they might appear Å¿ooner, for really thoÅ¿e <hi>Bigarreaux,</hi> and <hi>Morrello</hi>'s are admirable <hi>Fruits:</hi> The firÅ¿t are Ripe, as Å¿oon as they are half Red, but the others do not attain their perfection of maturity, until they are almoÅ¿t Black. The order of the maturity of all thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> is the Å¿ame with what we declar'd for the <hi>Strawberries,</hi> that which has <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om'd</hi> firÅ¿t in every <hi>Tree,</hi> likewiÅ¿e Ripens Å¿ooneÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>Here's the Month of <hi>June</hi> provided for, it is call'd the Month of Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> and with ReaÅ¿on: For thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> are met with wherever one goes; we have Å¿aid that the marks of their maturity is that Red Colour which Å¿urrounds them; it commonly begins at that part which is moÅ¿t immediately expos'd to the Sun, and is Å¿ooneÅ¿t Ripe; In fine, by degrees that Colour Å¿preads all over, and when the livelineÅ¿s of that Red begins to turn to an obÅ¿cure Red, excepting only the <hi>Morello</hi>'s, they draw towards Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48210:181"/>
Among Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> thoÅ¿e that have Stones, tho' never Å¿o ripe, do not eaÅ¿ily looÅ¿en from the <hi>Branch,</hi> as other <hi>Fruits</hi> do, they wither upon it, inÅ¿tead of falling, they muÅ¿t be pluck'd off, and that with Å¿ome Violence.</p>
                        <p>All thoÅ¿e kind of Red <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿hould be the only ones during the whole Month of <hi>June</hi> to fill up the Stage of the maturity of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of that SeaÅ¿on, but that Å¿ome <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> expos'd to the <hi>South,</hi> in Dry Sandy Grounds, begin to produce towards the end of <hi>June</hi> Å¿ome little <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Pears,</hi> and Å¿ome early <hi>MuÅ¿ck-Peaches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e Å¿mall <hi>Pears</hi> are Extraordinary good, if they be allow'd the time of Ripening; the firÅ¿t marks of their maturity appear in them as in all other <hi>Pears</hi> of every SeaÅ¿on, that is near the <hi>Stalk,</hi> which part muÅ¿t appear a little yellowiÅ¿h, and Å¿omewhat TranÅ¿parent; and afterwards, for a greater mark of full maturity, that yellowneÅ¿s muÅ¿t appear a little through a certain Tan'd Colour, and a certain Red, which covers the remainder of the <hi>Rind;</hi> and LaÅ¿tly, they muÅ¿t begin to drop of themÅ¿elves, without any exterior violence; at which time it will be proper to gather, and eat them.

                        <p>When People do not allow themÅ¿elves the time of examining about the Stalk of the <hi>Pears,</hi> to judge of their maturity; they muÅ¿t, as I have Å¿aid, judge by the natural drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Pears,</hi> but then the Worms muÅ¿t have no Å¿hare in it, and they muÅ¿t neither be grown upon a Å¿ick <hi>Tree,</hi> nor upon a Å¿ick <hi>Branch; Pears</hi> that are infected with Worms drop Å¿ooneÅ¿t, and Å¿ooneÅ¿t Å¿eem Ripe, without really being Å¿o, their defect is not much conceal'd, it appears generally in the middle of the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Pear,</hi> and when it does, there's no depending upon it for good <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All manner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> borh Stone, and Kernel, Ripen Å¿ooner upon Å¿ickly <hi>Trees,</hi> than upon Å¿ound ones; but we muÅ¿t not Å¿uffer our Å¿elves to be deceiv'd by the Å¿ize, for it often happens, eÅ¿pecially in relation to <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> that the <hi>Fruits</hi> of thoÅ¿e languiÅ¿hing <hi>Trees</hi> are larger than thoÅ¿e which grow upon Vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> but then that LargeneÅ¿s, as I may Å¿ay, is only a Å¿welling, or a kind of DropÅ¿ie, which is the ReaÅ¿on that the <hi>Pulp</hi> of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits,</hi> that are larger than they Å¿hould be, is generally inÅ¿ipid, or bitter, and diÅ¿guÅ¿ting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peaches</hi> that drop of themÅ¿elves, are contrary to what we have been Å¿aying of <hi>Pears;</hi> by reaÅ¿on that <hi>Peaches</hi> which drop thus of themÅ¿elves, or looÅ¿en, are commonly paÅ¿s'd, and conÅ¿equently naught, in Å¿o much, that they Å¿hould not be preÅ¿ented as good to any body, tho' not bruis'd by the fall, as it happens commonly.</p>
                        <p>But that Rule does not commonly extend to Å¿mall <hi>Peaches</hi> in their kind, nor eÅ¿pecially to early or late Purple <hi>Peaches,</hi> nor to <hi>Pavies;</hi> thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> which can hardly ever be too ripe, are commonly very good when they drop, inÅ¿omuch, that when they drop without being Å¿hook, it is a good mark of their Maturity, as well as GoodneÅ¿s.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿ame thing may be Å¿aid of <hi>Plums,</hi> Å¿ince we always Å¿hake <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> in order to get good <hi>Plums;</hi> tho' indeed this Method is more particularly for common <hi>Plums,</hi> than for <hi>Perdrigons, Rochecourbons,</hi> and other Principal <hi>Plums,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that one of their Chief Excellencies conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in the Flowry Beauty of their Complexion, the which excites the Appetite of the moÅ¿t moderate: A fall, or their being finger'd too much, Å¿poils that Flower which Å¿hould be preÅ¿erv'd carefully; therefore thoÅ¿e that are really Curious, never touch them otherwiÅ¿e than with the extremity of two Fingers.</p>
                        <p>Let us now return to our early <hi>Peaches,</hi> and Å¿ay, that the Part which ripens firÅ¿t in them, as well as in all other <hi>Fruits, Pears, Peaches, Plums, Apricooks, Melons,</hi> &amp;c. is commonly the inward part, I mean, that which is neareÅ¿t to the Stone, and moreover, that which in relation to them appears firÅ¿t ripe to the eye, is directly contrary to what we have Å¿aid of <hi>Pears;</hi> for whereas in <hi>Pears</hi> that part which is neareÅ¿t to the <hi>Stalk</hi> ripens firÅ¿t, in theÅ¿e it is commonly the Extremity which is oppoÅ¿ite to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that that part enjoys the benefit of the Sun Å¿ooner, and longer than any other; but when the Beams of the Sun lay upon no part of theÅ¿e early <hi>Peaches,</hi> it Å¿eems that the heat which Reigns in the Air, ripens them all over equally.</p>
                        <p>We begin to Judge of their approaching Maturity, when we perceive that they begin to thicken extreamly (which we call taking <hi>Pulp)</hi> and when at the Å¿ame time, their green whitens conÅ¿iderably, and their down begins to fall; but unfortunately for thoÅ¿e poor <hi>Fruits,</hi> or rather for Nice Pallats, and Å¿uch as have Skill; thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t appearances of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity are commonly miÅ¿taken for perfect maturity, and Å¿o they are gather'd, while they are Å¿till as hard as Stones, inÅ¿tead of Å¿taying until they are grown Mellow, as they Å¿hould be; and therefore, excepting a few of the firÅ¿t, which are Å¿erv'd pretty unÅ¿eaÅ¿onably, moÅ¿t of them paÅ¿s through the fire, before they appear at Table.</p>
                        <p>I muÅ¿t not omit Å¿aying in this place, that the <hi>Peaches</hi> which do not attain the Å¿ize their kind requires, commonly drop before their being ripe, and when they Å¿eem to ripen,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48210:181"/>
their <hi>Rind</hi> remains downy, their <hi>Pulp</hi> green, their Water bitter, and the Stone Larger than thoÅ¿e which have taken more <hi>Pulp.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither muÅ¿t I forget to Å¿ay, that as a little after the knitting of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> generally a conÅ¿iderable part of it drops, Å¿o it often happens that at the time the maturity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, a great number of the <hi>Fruits</hi> fall, and that about a Fortnight, or Three Weeks before that maturity, as if the <hi>Tree</hi> was Å¿enÅ¿ible of its being over-burthen'd, and would thereby give us notice that the good time is approaching; and indeed it is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erv'd at that time, that a good number of Large <hi>Fruits</hi> drop, whereby thoÅ¿e that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, grow the finer, and the better; and as we have already Å¿aid, it had been much the better for them, had the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> taken Care to perform what time has now done.</p>
                        <p>People are overjoy'd to Å¿ee thoÅ¿e early <hi>Peaches</hi> ripe at the end of <hi>June,</hi> and to enjoy them long, which is not difficult, provided we have Å¿everal <hi>Trees</hi> of them in different <hi>ExpoÅ¿ures;</hi> they are incomparable, when they are well-Condition'd, both as to Å¿ize, and maturity; but then we are commonly expos'd to the vexation of tarrying until towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> for the <hi>Peaches</hi> that Å¿ucceed theÅ¿e firÅ¿t, and thoÅ¿e we call <hi>Troy-Peaches;</hi> which <hi>Peaches,</hi> provided they be throughly ripe, charm every body by the fineneÅ¿s of their <hi>Pulp,</hi> the perfume of their Water, and the deliciouÅ¿neÅ¿s of their TaÅ¿t; their maturity is known as in other <hi>Fruits,</hi> FirÅ¿t by the Å¿ize, Secondly by a fine red Colour on that Å¿ide which is expos'd to the Sun, and a light TranÅ¿parent Yellow in the other parts: Thirdly, by a thin, Å¿oft, mellow <hi>Rind,</hi> Å¿omewhat like Satin; any of theÅ¿e marks being wanting, the <hi>Fruit</hi> cannot be ripe, and therefore Å¿hould not be gather'd.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e <hi>Troy-Peaches</hi> are often abus'd as well as the early <hi>Peaches,</hi> and all other <hi>Peaches</hi> at the entrance of their maturity; that is, they are gather'd upon the leaÅ¿t Symptoms, without Å¿taying until they have attain'd that degree of goodneÅ¿s, they never obtain 'till they are throughly ripe; and this defect proceeds, either from the ignorance, or liquoriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the PerÅ¿on, who gathers them out of deÅ¿ire to eat, or elÅ¿e out of a Å¿illy avidity of gain, which reigns in the Heart, and Eyes of thoÅ¿e who are uneaÅ¿ie until they expoÅ¿e them to Å¿ale in the Market.</p>
                        <p>The Month of <hi>July</hi> affords us many other <hi>Fruits</hi> beÅ¿ides <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> but the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿es it in point of abundance, for it affords us not only an infinity of <hi>Plums,</hi> but alÅ¿o a vaÅ¿t quantity of Kernel-<hi>Fruits;</hi> among which, are the <hi>CuiÅ¿Å¿e-Madame,</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thigh,</hi> the <hi>Gros-Blanquet,</hi> the <hi>Sans-Peau,</hi> or <hi>without Rind,</hi> The <hi>EÅ¿pargne,</hi> or <hi>Sparing,</hi> the <hi>Orange-Pears,</hi> the <hi>Summer-Bon-Chreitien,</hi> the <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿olets,</hi> the <hi>Robins,</hi> the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ettings,</hi> &amp;c. the maturity of which is known, either by their dropping, or not reÅ¿iÅ¿ting when they are gather'd, or elÅ¿e by a certain yellow colour, which appears in the <hi>Rind,</hi> eÅ¿pecially near the <hi>Stalk.</hi> Among <hi>Plums</hi> we reckon the <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> the <hi>Mirabelles, Imperials,</hi> St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine, Roche-Courbon, Queen Claude, Apricock-Plums, &amp;c.</hi> To thoÅ¿e <hi>Plums</hi> are joyn'd about the middle of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> Å¿ome fine <hi>Peaches, Viz.</hi> FirÅ¿t, the two <hi>Magdalens,</hi> the white and red, the <hi>Mignonne,</hi> the <hi>Bourdin,</hi> the <hi>RoÅ¿Å¿ane,</hi> &amp;c. all which are large: In the Å¿econd place, the <hi>Alberges,</hi> both red, and yellow, the <hi>Cherry-Peach,</hi> the one with white <hi>Pulp,</hi> the other with yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoÅ¿e <hi>Peaches,</hi> as well as thoÅ¿e that are to Å¿ucceed them, have no other particular marks to diÅ¿cover their maturity, than thoÅ¿e I have already mention'd for early, and <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> which are a reaÅ¿onable Å¿ize, a red and yellowiÅ¿h colour without any mixture of Green, and eÅ¿pecially their coming off with eaÅ¿e at the leaÅ¿t pull or motion of a Skilful hand; all theÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> are fit to eat as Å¿oon as gather'd, and require no <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> at leaÅ¿t to ripen, <hi>Peaches</hi> never ripening off the <hi>Tree,</hi> Å¿o that it is in vain to gather them before they are perfectly ripe; but as I have Å¿aid elÅ¿ewhere, a day or two's repoÅ¿e in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> far from injuring of them, affords them a certain coolneÅ¿s which is very proper for them, and which they cannot acquire, while they remain upon the <hi>Tree.</hi>

                        <p>The Month of <hi>September</hi> is famous for a world of the Principal <hi>Peaches,</hi> the <hi>ChevreuÅ¿e, HaÅ¿ty Violet, PerÅ¿ique, Admirable, Pourpree,</hi> or <hi>Purple-Peach, Bellegarde, White d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilly,</hi> beÅ¿ides <hi>Brugnons,</hi> and white <hi>Pavies, &amp;c.</hi> There are alÅ¿o Å¿ome Summer <hi>Calville Apples,</hi> and Å¿ome good <hi>Pears,</hi> which keep theÅ¿e <hi>Peaches</hi> Company, and may be eaten off the <hi>Tree, Viz.</hi> The <hi>Melting-Pear</hi> of <hi>BreÅ¿t,</hi> brown <hi>Orange-Pears,</hi> &amp;c. At leaÅ¿t they will not keep long, the <hi>Pears</hi> grow too mellow, and the <hi>Apples</hi> grow downy; but yet at this time Kernel-<hi>Fruit</hi> will begin to require a little reÅ¿t in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> and the beÅ¿t way to judge of their maturity, is to Å¿queeze them gently with the Thumb about the <hi>Stalk,</hi> to try whether they yield, or no.</p>
                        <p>The Month of <hi>October</hi> is likewiÅ¿e to be valued for the laÅ¿t Admirable <hi>Peaches</hi> it produces in the open Air, or in the <hi>WeÅ¿t, Viz.</hi> The <hi>Nivet,</hi> and latter <hi>Violets,</hi> beÅ¿ides the Large Red, as well as Yellow <hi>Pavies,</hi> without omitting the fine latter yellow <hi>Peaches,</hi> all growing in good ExpoÅ¿itions.

                           <p>Of the Situation that is proper for the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are gather'd, in order to PreÅ¿erve them Å¿ome time.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN Order to end what I have begun, I am now only to Å¿peak of the means of PreÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as much as can be, good <hi>Fruits</hi> after their being gather'd, and of the means of tranÅ¿porting them when it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary: As to the preÅ¿ervation, I mean Å¿uch in particular, as are not gather'd until they have attain'd a full maturity, and Å¿uch as being extream tender and puny, make an end of acquiring it after their being taken out of the <hi>Garden,</hi> both the one and the other loÅ¿ing their LuÅ¿tre and Beauty to a high degree, by being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bruis'd, rub'd, Å¿cratch'd, or Å¿potted with little black Spots; Å¿uch are your <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Peaches</hi> with their fine Colour, and delicate <hi>Pulp;</hi> Å¿uch are <hi>Plums</hi> with the fine flower that covers them, and <hi>Butter-Pears</hi> that are perfectly ripe; This has no relation to other <hi>Fruits</hi> that are neither Å¿o choice, as <hi>Cherries, Morello's, Bigarreaux,</hi> &amp;c. Nor Å¿o eaÅ¿ily Å¿poil'd, as <hi>Melons, Pavies,</hi> hard <hi>Pears,</hi> baking <hi>Pears,</hi> all <hi>Apples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e that every <hi>Fig,</hi> every <hi>Peach,</hi> and every <hi>Plum</hi> has been gather'd with all the Caution I have heretofore explain'd, inÅ¿omuch, that in the taking them off the <hi>Tree,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to their perfection; I alÅ¿o Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that in the gathering of them, care has been taken to lay them in <hi>Sives,</hi> with tender Å¿oft <hi>Leaves,</hi> as <hi>Vine-Leaves,</hi> &amp;c. And to place them all aÅ¿under, that they may be no wiÅ¿e Å¿queez'd, nor any laid a top of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaÅ¿on that the weight of the upermoÅ¿t would be capable of bruÅ¿ing the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t, and that particularly for <hi>Peaches,</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> for <hi>Plums</hi> are not Å¿o heavy as to hurt one another.</p>
                        <p>Now, in order to preÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿ome days, that is, two or three days, eÅ¿pecially the <hi>Peaches;</hi> they muÅ¿t be laid either in <hi>CloÅ¿ets,</hi> or <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es,</hi> which muÅ¿t be very dry, and clean, and full of Shelves, the Windows being always open, unleÅ¿s it be in very Cold weather: Hereafter I will explain the Conditions of a good <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory;</hi> you muÅ¿t lay a finger thick of MoÅ¿s upon thoÅ¿e Shelves, which may Å¿erve, as it were for a kind of Quilt, taking care that the MoÅ¿s be very dry, and has no ill Å¿cent; the ReaÅ¿on of which is, that every <hi>Peach</hi> Å¿o plac'd, Å¿inks of it Å¿elf into the MoÅ¿s, and lies Å¿oftly, without being Å¿queez'd by any of the others. I dare affirm that it is with <hi>Peaches,</hi> as with <hi>Melons,</hi> which are better to eat a day after their being gather'd, and left at a diÅ¿tance from the Sun, than JuÅ¿t after their being gather'd, at which time they are lukewarm: Altho' it is not good to touch <hi>Fruit</hi> much, either upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> yet, provided it be perform'd by a Skilful hand, it will not prejudice it; therefore, while thoÅ¿e <hi>Peaches</hi> lay in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> they muÅ¿t be carefully viÅ¿ited once a day, to Å¿ee whether there appears no marks of rottenneÅ¿s, at the Å¿ame time removing all Å¿uch that are in the leaÅ¿t tainted, otherwiÅ¿e they would Å¿poil others.</p>
                        <p>It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to place <hi>Fruits</hi> well in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> thoÅ¿e that have not thoÅ¿e regards, loÅ¿e abundance of them by their own fault: the beÅ¿t Å¿ituation for <hi>Peaches,</hi> is, to be plac'd, not only upon MoÅ¿s, but upon the part which Joyn'd to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e they are apt to bruiÅ¿e; <hi>Figs</hi> muÅ¿t be laid Å¿idewiÅ¿e, by reaÅ¿on that if they were laid upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> they would loÅ¿e their beÅ¿t juice; as for <hi>Plums,</hi> whereas they have no great weight they may be laid any how, as well as <hi>Cherries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The beÅ¿t Å¿ituation for <hi>Pears,</hi> their Figure being Pyramidal, is to be plac'd upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> with the <hi>Stalk</hi> upwards; it is indifferent whether <hi>Apples,</hi> the Figure of which forms a perfect Cube, lay upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Stalk,</hi> which is always very Å¿hort, both theÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> will preÅ¿erve themÅ¿elves well enough upon the bare boards, beÅ¿ides, for a while they may lie upon one another, when firÅ¿t brought out of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> until they approach to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity; but above all, I would not allow them any Bed or Covering of Straw, or Hay, by reaÅ¿on, that commonly it gives them an ill Å¿cent.</p>
                        <p>The beÅ¿t way for <hi>Grapes</hi> is to hang them up in the Air faÅ¿ten'd to a packthread, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Hoop, or Å¿ix'd to Å¿ome Beam; beÅ¿ides, they may be laid Å¿afe enough upon Straw,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48210:182"/>
and when any body deÅ¿ires to preÅ¿erve them until <hi>February, March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> they muÅ¿t be gather'd before they are perfectly ripe, otherwiÅ¿e they are apt to rot too Å¿oon; beÅ¿ides, Care muÅ¿t be taken once in two or three days to pick all the rotten ones carefully.</p>
                        <p>All manner of <hi>Apples</hi> will laÅ¿t until <hi>March,</hi> and Å¿ome until <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, the <hi>Reynettes,</hi> or French <hi>Peppins, Apis, RoÅ¿e-Apples, Francatie, &amp;c.</hi> Care being taken that the greateÅ¿t Mark of their maturity commonly conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in being Å¿omewhat wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, excepting the <hi>Apples</hi> of <hi>Api,</hi> and the <hi>RoÅ¿e-Apples,</hi> which never wrinkle; they are known to be ripe when all the green which appear'd in the <hi>Rind</hi> is turn'd yellow.</p>
                        <p>The deÅ¿tiny of <hi>Pears,</hi> as to their laÅ¿ting, is very different, thoÅ¿e that laÅ¿t longeÅ¿t, are the <hi>Bon-ChreÅ¿tiens, St. Lezin, Dry-Martins, Martin-Sires, Baking-Pears, Double-BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Franc-reals, &amp;c.</hi> I will Å¿peak more at large of them in the TreatiÅ¿e of the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have Å¿et down elÅ¿ewhere which are commonly the <hi>Pears</hi> of every Month, and therefore it would be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s to repeat it here: Red <hi>Fruits</hi> laÅ¿t but little after their being gather'd, <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>RaÅ¿pberries</hi> are Å¿eldom good after a day, <hi>Cherries, Morello's, Bigarreaux,</hi> and <hi>Currans</hi> may perhaps laÅ¿t a day longer; good <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿hould be Å¿erv'd upon the Table in the Å¿ame Å¿ituation they are plac'd in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es,</hi> in order to make a pretty Å¿how, excepting only <hi>Pears,</hi> which in that CaÅ¿e require Å¿ome agreeable Cimetry for the ConÅ¿truction of the Pyramids.</p>
                        <p>With all theÅ¿e Precautions, <hi>Fruits</hi> may be eaÅ¿ily preÅ¿erv'd as long as they can laÅ¿t, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can prejudice them, but great Winter FroÅ¿ts, which are very dangerous, by reaÅ¿on that they may penetrate into the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es,</hi> and Å¿o reach the <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> that has once been Frozen, preÅ¿erves no manner of goodneÅ¿s, and immediately decays; thoÅ¿e that have no <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es</hi> made on purpoÅ¿e, with all the neceÅ¿Å¿ary regards, I Å¿hall explain in the Å¿equel, and who have only a CloÅ¿et, or Å¿ome ordinary room, are in danger of loÅ¿ing all their <hi>Fruit</hi> in bad Weather, unleÅ¿s they take a great deal of care to cover them well with good Blankets, or place them between two Quilts, or elÅ¿e carry them into Å¿ome Cellar, until the danger be paÅ¿t, at which time thoÅ¿e poor PriÅ¿oners are taken out of their Dungeons, to be put at Liberty again in their former Places.</p>

                        <p>This Prelude conducts us inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, that <hi>Peaches, Figs, Strawberries, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rello's, &amp;c.</hi> in order to their being tranÅ¿ported from one place to another, require Water-Carriage, or the Back or Arms of a Porter without any jogging, and above all, if they be <hi>Peaches,</hi> they muÅ¿t be laid upon that part which is fix'd to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> without touching one another, and be laid firÅ¿t upon a Bed of <hi>MoÅ¿s,</hi> or tender <hi>Leaves</hi> laid pretty thick; and in the Å¿econd place, wrapt up in <hi>Vine-Leaves,</hi> and Å¿o well order'd, that they may not move out of their places; and finally, in caÅ¿e Å¿everal Beds be laid over one another, a good Å¿eparation muÅ¿t be made between them of <hi>MoÅ¿s,</hi> or of a reaÅ¿onable quantity of <hi>Leaves,</hi> the laÅ¿t Couch muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be pretty well cover'd with <hi>Leaves,</hi> and the whole wrapt up with a Cloth, well faÅ¿ten'd, in order to keep all that is contain'd in the Basket cloÅ¿e, and in good order: The Å¿afeÅ¿t way would be to do with <hi>Peaches,</hi> what I am going to preÅ¿cribe for <hi>Figs,</hi> but then the inconvenience is, that it would be impoÅ¿Å¿ible to carry any conÅ¿iderable quantity at a time. For <hi>Figs</hi> you muÅ¿t have Sives not above two inches deep, and lay a bed of <hi>Vine-Leaves</hi> at the bottom of them, and place the <hi>Figs</hi> Å¿idewiÅ¿e, wraping them up firÅ¿t, aÅ¿under, each in one of the Å¿aid <hi>Leaves,</hi> taking care to order them Å¿o well, and Å¿o

neatly cloÅ¿e to one another, that the motion of the tranÅ¿portation may not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, and never lay two a top of one another: This firÅ¿t and only Bed being made, it muÅ¿t be cover'd with Leaves, and next with a Sheet of Paper, neatly fix'd round about the Sive, and moreover Å¿tay'd with Å¿ome Å¿mall Packthread, in order to keep the <hi>Fruit</hi> cloÅ¿e into the Å¿aid Sive.</p>
                        <p>Good <hi>Plums</hi> being laid up, without any Ceremony, in any Basket, or Sive, with a good Bed of <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>Nettles</hi> at the bottom of it; the top muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be cover'd with <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> after having firÅ¿t taken off the thickeÅ¿t down, which being done, the whole muÅ¿t be Cover'd with a Linen Cloth, or Å¿ome Sheets of Paper, faÅ¿ten'd with Å¿ome Pack-thread:</p>
                        <p>Common <hi>Plums</hi> may be tranÅ¿ported in great Baskets, barely putting Å¿mall <hi>Leaves</hi> under, and over them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Apricock-Plums</hi> are Å¿ent from <hi>Tours</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> upon MeÅ¿Å¿engers HorÅ¿es, with a great deal more precaution apart, for they are put in Boxes Å¿tuff'd with Houads, every one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover Å¿eparately wrapt up in Houads; but that Expedient is Chargeable, beÅ¿ides it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to carry many at a time.</p>

                           <hi>Strawberries</hi> being likewiÅ¿e order'd in double ridges, in Baskets made on purpoÅ¿e, Å¿tuff'd with leaves at the bottom, and round about; it will Å¿uffice to cover them with a fine Wet Piece of Linnen, abundance of them are carryd thus, according to the bigneÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e Baskets.</p>

                           <hi>Grapes,</hi> either <hi>MuÅ¿cat</hi> or <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿elas,</hi> are partly carry'd in the Å¿ame manner I have noted for <hi>Peaches;</hi> nay with leÅ¿s Ceremony, Å¿ince it is not very material to Å¿eparate every Bed with Leaves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>MuÅ¿cat Grapes,</hi> are Å¿ometimes Å¿ent into diÅ¿tant Countrys, and they are put in CaÅ¿es fill'd with Bran, and carry'd upon HorÅ¿es or Mules, care being taken that the <hi>Bunches</hi> may not touch one another; But that is an Expence only proper for Kings, or very great Lords.</p>
                        <p>For the TranÅ¿portation of our Principal <hi>Fruits,</hi> when they are only to be Å¿ent a Days Journey at moÅ¿t, I commonly uÅ¿e certain Å¿quare Baskets, divided in the InÅ¿ide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Å¿everal Stories, which are at a convenient diÅ¿tance from one another, to place our Sives full of <hi>Fruit;</hi> thoÅ¿e are either made of very CloÅ¿e Ozier, and then they need no other covering to Å¿ecure them from DuÅ¿t, or elÅ¿e of looÅ¿e <hi>Ozier,</hi> and then they muÅ¿t be cover'd with Sere-Cloath; moreover, thoÅ¿e Baskets open Å¿idewiÅ¿e like a kind of PreÅ¿s, or elÅ¿e at the top, and then the loweÅ¿t Story muÅ¿t be fill'd firÅ¿t, and a little covering laid over it which Å¿erves to cloÅ¿e this firÅ¿t, and to bear the Second, and thus to the uppermoÅ¿t; a Å¿mall Pad-lock may be fixed to it, at pleaÅ¿ure, to which two Keys may be made, the one for thoÅ¿e to whom the <hi>Fruit</hi> is Å¿ent, and the other remaining with the PerÅ¿on who Å¿ends it, by which means the <hi>Fruit</hi> is convey'd Å¿afely.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IF in that very Å¿eaÅ¿on, when <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> Charm moÅ¿t by their <hi>GreenneÅ¿s,</hi> and neatneÅ¿s, <hi>Fruits</hi> are notwithÅ¿tanding their chief Ornament, what advantages, or rather what ConÅ¿olations are not thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> capable of affording us, when in the middle of a diÅ¿mal, Melancholy Winter, we are provided with a ConÅ¿iderable Å¿tore of them, and even Å¿ome of them Infinitely better than any the Summer had Å¿upplied us with. There is no denying that we are all naturally inclined to have a Violent PaÅ¿Å¿ion for <hi>Fruits,</hi> and by that very reaÅ¿on, as they are delicious to the Palate, we eaÅ¿ily perÅ¿wade our Å¿elves that they are of uÅ¿e for our Health; PhyÅ¿itians who are to give no Rules againÅ¿t Infirmities, are Å¿o far from oppoÅ¿ing this Opinion, that they EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h it as Infallible, and often preÅ¿cribe the uÅ¿e of <hi>Fruits</hi> as Soveraign Remedies; for which reaÅ¿on moÅ¿t People are at preÅ¿ent Curious of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and many Gentlemen are proud of expreÅ¿Å¿ing their EarneÅ¿tneÅ¿s in Rearing them: Nature Å¿eems to delight in favouring that CurioÅ¿ity, it yearly produces abundance of <hi>Fruits;</hi> the Summer produces but too many, and Autumn yields a Å¿ufficient quantity; but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is to have Å¿ome in the Winter, which is a Dead, Infertile SeaÅ¿on; therefore we Å¿hould make it our Å¿tudy to preÅ¿erve Å¿uch, as are only good a conÅ¿iderable while after their being gather'd; they are Expos'd to a long Journey, in which they are to run many hazards: It does not only require a careful man, but alÅ¿o a Place that may be altogether proper to preÅ¿erve

them; we muÅ¿t on one Å¿ide Combat Cold which deÅ¿troys all thoÅ¿e it reaches, on the other hand we muÅ¿t prevent all ill Å¿cents, which would Å¿poil what the Weather had Å¿par'd: This Place is commonly call'd a <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> which without doubt muÅ¿t have its Rules, and particular properties, Å¿ince it is Å¿o uÅ¿eful, and is to produce Å¿uch good Effects. It is to be Å¿uppos'd that I muÅ¿t needs be skill'd in that Point, conÅ¿idering the Great and Ancient uÅ¿e I have made of it in <hi>Gardens;</hi> and ConÅ¿equently I Å¿hould certainly be blam'd, unleÅ¿s I declar'd what my Experience has taught me in relation to <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avoid the defects that are to be fear'd in it, or to attain the Å¿ucceÅ¿s that is to be hop'd for.</p>
                        <p>Let other CurioÅ¿o's, which are in Å¿o great a Number, cry up their CloÅ¿ets as much as they pleaÅ¿e, let them Invite every body to come and Å¿ee them, let them be careful in making rich DeÅ¿criptions of them, I am Å¿o far from finding fault at it, that I am one of the firÅ¿t to Commend them, I ViÅ¿it them with a Å¿ingular Å¿atisfaction, and take great delight in looking upon Å¿uch things as are moÅ¿t Extraordinary, not only for the matter, but likewiÅ¿e for the WorkmanÅ¿hip; I Å¿ay, let People cry up thoÅ¿e Collections of Miracles of Art, but at leaÅ¿t let them allow thoÅ¿e that are Curious in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> the liberty of boaÅ¿ting of their <hi>Store-HouÅ¿es</hi> of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are their CloÅ¿ets; not that they contain any Originals, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, far from it, their greateÅ¿t Value conÅ¿iÅ¿ts altogether in Novelty, but then they are excellent Novelties; that is, they are productions of Nature, which renew, and take new Vigour Yearly: Productions which indeed are only, if I may uÅ¿e the ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion, Å¿o many Copies of its firÅ¿t Productions at the Birth of Time, which at the Å¿ame time Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿es the Merit of thoÅ¿e Originals: By reaÅ¿on that this Nature having been Charm'd at firÅ¿t, with the Beauty of its firÅ¿t EÅ¿Å¿ays, has taken delight in repeating them as often as it could, as if it really Study'd more and more to improve, even to that degree, that it Å¿uffers it Å¿elf to be Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little by <hi>Culture,</hi> Å¿eeing that <hi>Culture</hi> really contributes to the Perfectioning of its new Productions.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, I am of Opinion, that no Body will deny that this CloÅ¿et deÅ¿erves to be Å¿een, and in truth nothing can be more agreeable to Å¿ight than this <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> where at the firÅ¿t Entrance you diÅ¿cover a kind of well contriv'd Room, of which the Å¿ize is proportion'd to the OccaÅ¿ion for which it was Built, where you diÅ¿cover in the next Place, a fine Edg d-Table, which takes up the middle of the Place, and is convenient and neceÅ¿Å¿ary to order the Baskets, or <hi>China-</hi>BaÅ¿ons that are to be Å¿erv'd, where finally you diÅ¿cover the four Walls GarniÅ¿h'd, and Å¿ee all the Shelves well Order'd, and fill'd both in Autumn and Winter with fine <hi>Fruits;</hi> thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> differently plac'd with flying Labels, to expreÅ¿s their kinds, and Maturity in relation to the Sequel of Months; thus <hi>Burgamots</hi> are order'd in one Place, <hi>Virgoules</hi> in another, <hi>Ambrets</hi> here, <hi>Thorn-Pears</hi> there, <hi>LeÅ¿chaÅ¿Å¿erirs</hi> here, the St. <hi>Germans</hi> there, <hi>Bonchretien</hi> here, <hi>Bugy</hi> there, Baking <hi>Pears</hi> here, there the <hi>Apples,</hi> with the Å¿ame DiÅ¿tinctions obÅ¿erv'd for the <hi>Pears;</hi> here <hi>Fruits</hi> that drop of themÅ¿elves, there Å¿uch as have been gather'd in SeaÅ¿on, here thoÅ¿e of the <hi>North,</hi> there thoÅ¿e of good <hi>EÅ¿palies;</hi> here thoÅ¿e of <hi>High-Standards,</hi> there thoÅ¿e of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> there the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are Ripe in Å¿uch a Month, there thoÅ¿e that do not Ripen Å¿o Å¿oon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with this ConÅ¿tant order, that thoÅ¿e that are Ripe are always moÅ¿t within reach, both for the Hand and Eye, and thoÅ¿e that are not Ripe yet, according to their Degree, plac'd upon higher Shelves, where they expect the SeaÅ¿on that is to ripen them, and ConÅ¿equently to be remov'd in the Room of thoÅ¿e that are PaÅ¿s'd; thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t DiÅ¿appear after having perform'd their Part, and finiÅ¿h'd their Career; and others are ready to Succeed them, and as it were, to come each to their turn to Å¿erve the quarter which is deÅ¿Å¿ign'd for them.</p>
                        <p>Finally, do's not the Liberality of our CurioÅ¿o towards his Friends (for he loves to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part what he has) deÅ¿erve Å¿ome privilegde to raiÅ¿e the Merit of his CloÅ¿et above others, out of which we only bring bare Ideas, and were far from receiving any Liberaliteis, on the contrary the CurioÅ¿o makes profeÅ¿Å¿ion of being cloÅ¿e FiÅ¿ted; he never makes a Å¿how of his TreaÅ¿ure unleÅ¿s it be againÅ¿t his Will; there conÅ¿tantly appears a great deal of diÅ¿guÅ¿t in him, which Å¿ometimes proceeds from the fear of being Robb'd, but more commonly out of fear of not being thought as Rich, as he pretends to be.</p>
                        <p>Let us now Proceed to EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the principal Conditions of a good <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e;</hi> In my Opinion the FirÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in its being inpenetrable to FroÅ¿ts; great Cold as we have already often declar'd being a mortal Enemy to <hi>Fruits,</hi> thoÅ¿e that are once Frozen, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after good for any thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="96" facs="tcp:48210:184"/>
It follows from thence, for the Second Condition, that this <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> muÅ¿t he expos'd to the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>EaÅ¿t,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t to the <hi>WeÅ¿t;</hi> the <hi>Northern</hi> ExpoÅ¿ition would be very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to it.</p>
                        <p>It alÅ¿o follows for the Third Condition, that the Wall of the Å¿aid <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t Twenty Four Inches thick, or elÅ¿e the FroÅ¿t could not be kept out.</p>
                        <p>It likewiÅ¿e follows for the Fourth Condition, that the Windows beÅ¿ides the Common Quarrels, Å¿hould have good double Paper Saches, Very cloÅ¿e, and very well Å¿topt, together with a Double Door, inÅ¿omuch that the Cold Air from abroad, may not be able to enter in, for it would certainly deÅ¿troy the Temperate Air which has been preÅ¿erv'd of Old in the InÅ¿ide, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be too exact in this care, Å¿ince the leaÅ¿t or any, might occaÅ¿ion a great deal of diÅ¿order in one FroÅ¿ty Night; I do not in the leaÅ¿t approve the making of Fire in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on, I have Å¿ufficiently EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd in the TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding all theÅ¿e Conditions, which perhaps have not been exactly ObÅ¿erv'd the thing being pritty difficult, it is abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to have Å¿ome Å¿mall VeÅ¿Å¿el full of Water in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> to be certain, It is a faithful Incorruptible Centry, which is to give us notice of all that may Prejudice us; when that Water does not Freeze there is nothing to be done; but when it Freezes in the leaÅ¿t, a remedy muÅ¿t Immeadiately be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd: The Colds of the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1670, 1675, 1676, 1678, that of <hi>January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> 1679. and eÅ¿pecially that of <hi>December</hi> 1683, and of <hi>January</hi> 1684, which laÅ¿ted a whole Month, without diÅ¿continuation the laÅ¿t time, muÅ¿t needs Å¿erve for a great InÅ¿truction in this Matter; it required a great deal of Care, and forecaÅ¿t, not to be caught by it. A good Weather-GlaÅ¿s plac'd on the out-Å¿ide at the <hi>Northern-ExpoÅ¿ure</hi> is of great uÅ¿e; we have reaÅ¿on to Judge the Peril great, when this Weather-GlaÅ¿s continues for two Nights together to be, at the fifth and Å¿ixth Degrees, and even the Å¿eventh and eighth; the firÅ¿t Night may have done no harm, the Å¿econd is much to be fear'd, and therefore it is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary the very next Day after Å¿uch a Night to uÅ¿e good Quilts, or good Blankets, or elÅ¿e a great deal of dry MoÅ¿s to Å¿ecure our <hi>Fruits</hi> from FroÅ¿t; nay more, having a good Cellar, it will be very proper to remove our <hi>Fruits</hi> into it, and leave them there until the great Cold be paÅ¿s'd, and in all theÅ¿e CaÅ¿es care muÅ¿t be taken to replace all thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> as they were before in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e;</hi> as Å¿oon as the Weather grows better, and to remove Å¿uch as are Ripe, and Å¿uch as are tainted, RotenneÅ¿s is one of the worÅ¿t accidents to be fear'd, while <hi>Fruits</hi> are not in a Condition to be ViÅ¿ited often one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>After having made ProviÅ¿ion againÅ¿t Cold, we muÅ¿t Study to preÅ¿erve our <hi>Fruits</hi> from ill TaÅ¿te; the Neighbourhood of Hay, Straw, Dung, CheeÅ¿e, a great deal of Foul Linnen, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as has been imploy'd in the Kitchen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all very dangerous, and muÅ¿t not in the leaÅ¿t be Å¿uffer'd near our <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory;</hi> a certain MuÅ¿ty TaÅ¿te, together with the Å¿mell of many <hi>Fruits</hi> laid up together is likewiÅ¿e very diÅ¿agreeable, and therefore the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> muÅ¿t not only have good Overtures, and a high Ceiling, the juÅ¿t meaÅ¿ure of which, is to be from Ten to Twelve Foot high, but the Windows muÅ¿t often be kept open, that is, as often as there is no fear of great Cold either in the Night, or in the Day, freÅ¿h Air from without, when it is Temperate, is Incomparable to purify, and reeÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, that which has been long inclos'd.</p>
                        <p>For the Sixth Condition, I think I may Å¿ay, that neither a Cellar nor a Garret are Å¿it to make this <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> the Cellar by reaÅ¿on of a muÅ¿tineÅ¿s, and moiÅ¿t heat that are inÅ¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from it, which inclines the <hi>Fruit</hi> to RottenneÅ¿s; the Garret becauÅ¿e of the Cold, which eaÅ¿ily Penetrates the Roof; and therefore a ground Room is the beÅ¿t for our UÅ¿e, or at leaÅ¿t a firÅ¿t Story, accompany'd with other Lodging-Rooms Inhabited over and under it, as well as on the Å¿ides.</p>
                        <p>I add to this Sixth Condition, that the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> muÅ¿t be often viÅ¿ited by him that has it in Charge, which is neglected when he is not at Hand, that is, conveniently plac'd, by reaÅ¿on of the trouble of going too much up, or down.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿eventh Condition requires, many Å¿helves fram'd together in order to Lodge the <hi>Fruits</hi> Å¿eparately the one from the other, the fineÅ¿t on the beÅ¿t Å¿ide, and Baking-<hi>Pears</hi> on the worÅ¿t; <hi>Apples</hi> muÅ¿t lye by themÅ¿elves. The reaÅ¿onable diÅ¿tance of theÅ¿e Shelves is to be about Nine or Ten Inches; and I would have them about Seventeen or Eighteen Inches broad, that they may hold the more, and pleaÅ¿e the Å¿ight the better.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48210:184"/>
For the Eighth Condition, I would have thoÅ¿e Å¿helves a little Å¿loaping outwardly, that is, about an Inch in the Breadth, with an Edge about Two Fingers high, to hinder the <hi>Fruit</hi> from Falling: The <hi>Fruits</hi> are not Å¿o much in Å¿ight when the Shelves are level, as when they are as I deÅ¿ire them, and thus when any of them are Rotten it is not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily perceived, and that RottenneÅ¿s Communicates it Å¿elf to thoÅ¿e that are about it, unleÅ¿s remedy'd at firÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>The fear of that RottenneÅ¿s requires for a Ninth Condition, that every Shelf Å¿hould be viÅ¿ited at leaÅ¿t every other day, without fail, to remove what ever may be tainted.</p>
                        <p>And for the Tenth Condition, it requires that the Shelves Å¿hould be cover'd with Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for InÅ¿tance dry MoÅ¿s, or about an Inch thick of fine Sand, in order to keep every <hi>Fruit</hi> Å¿teady, after its being plac'd upon its BaÅ¿is, as it Å¿hould be, and to keep it aÅ¿under, for the <hi>Fruits</hi> muÅ¿t no wiÅ¿e be allow'd to touch each other: It is much pleaÅ¿anter to Å¿ee them all in a row upon their BaÅ¿is, that is, upon the Eye which is oppoÅ¿ite to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> than to Å¿ee them Lye pell mell any how.</p>
                        <p>I require for the LaÅ¿t Condition, that Care be taken to Sweep our <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> or <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> often, to Å¿uffer no Cobwebs in it, and to keep Traps for Rats and Mice, and moreover it will not be amiÅ¿s to allow it Å¿ome Å¿ecret Entrance for Cats, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e the <hi>Fruit</hi> will be in danger of being gnaw'd by thoÅ¿e Curs'd little DomeÅ¿tick Animals.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> which is particularly deÅ¿ign'd for <hi>Winter-Fruits,</hi> is likewiÅ¿e very uÅ¿eful for thoÅ¿e of <hi>Autumn,</hi> either <hi>Pears</hi> or <hi>Grapes,</hi> and for <hi>Summer Fruits,</hi> either <hi>Peaches, Pavies, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. TheÅ¿e being in my opinion, as I have already Å¿aid, much better a day after their being gather'd, than the very day; they acquire a certain coolneÅ¿s in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> which is a great Improvement which they can never have, while they are upon the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now whereas generally Å¿peaking, the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are moÅ¿t ConÅ¿iderable, are only brought into the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> after their having acquir'd one of the two Maturities, which is proper for them, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>Summer Fruits</hi> an approaching Maturity, which Expediates them in few days, and for <hi>Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Winter-Fruits,</hi> a diÅ¿tant Maturity, which makes them keep long, Å¿ome leÅ¿s, Å¿ome more; and beÅ¿ides, whereas it is the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maturity, which is of moÅ¿t ConÅ¿equence, as well for thoÅ¿e good <hi>Fruits,</hi> which would periÅ¿h miÅ¿erably, unleÅ¿s taken in the nick, as for the MaÅ¿ter whoÅ¿e pains, cares, and hopes would be loÅ¿t, unleÅ¿s he were capable, as the Å¿aying is, to nick the Critical Minute; it follows from thence, that it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make an end of giving, in this place, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible marks by which this Maturity is to be known: I have already explain'd thoÅ¿e: marks for moÅ¿t <hi>Fruits</hi> which do not exceed <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October, viz.</hi> for the remainder of <hi>Summer Pears,</hi> the remainder of <hi>Plums,</hi> the beÅ¿t latter <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Pavies, &amp;c.</hi> There now remains to Å¿peak of <hi>October Pears,</hi> and others, which keep from <hi>All-Saints,</hi> till <hi>EaÅ¿ter,</hi> and longer.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Vertelongue</hi> or <hi>Long-Green, Butter-Pears, Vine-Pears, MeÅ¿Å¿ire-John, Green-Sugar-Pears,</hi> &amp;c. after theÅ¿e, the <hi>Petit-oins, LanÅ¿aes, MarchioneÅ¿Å¿es, Burgamots, Amadottes,</hi> and even the <hi>BeÅ¿ideri,</hi> and <hi>Thick-Stalks,</hi> &amp;c. are the firÅ¿t, that are to paÅ¿s during the Month of <hi>November;</hi> the <hi>Thumb</hi> (as we have obÅ¿erv'd already, for the <hi>Butter-Pears, Long-Greens, Green-Sugar-Peart,</hi> and others, which have began to ripen in <hi>October)</hi> daly turns what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ripens out of the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e,</hi> viz. <hi>Petit-oins, MarchioneÅ¿Å¿es, RuÅ¿Å¿ettines, LanÅ¿aes</hi> &amp;c. by reaÅ¿on that theÅ¿e are Å¿till tender <hi>Pears;</hi> a WhitiÅ¿h Colour which forms it Å¿elf in the Rind of the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ire-John,</hi> a Yellow caÅ¿t in the <hi>Amadottes, Thick-Stalks, BeÅ¿ideri,</hi> &amp;c. and a moiÅ¿ture upon the Rind of the <hi>Burgamots,</hi> together with a little YellowneÅ¿s which diÅ¿covers it Å¿elf upon them, all thoÅ¿e are certain Å¿igns which inform us without the help of the <hi>Thumb,</hi> of what we have a mind to know of thoÅ¿e loÅ¿t kinds of <hi>Fruits,</hi> 'tis but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of them ConÅ¿tantly, or at leaÅ¿t every other day, and that Rule of review for the Maturity is to be continu'd the following Months for all other <hi>Fruits,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, in order not to loÅ¿e the leaÅ¿t Å¿ign which diÅ¿covers their approaching Maturity; moreover this review is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, to remove Å¿uch as begin to Rot.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonne, Winter-Thornes, Ambrets, LeÅ¿chaÅ¿eries,</hi> St. <hi>Germains, Vergoules,</hi> even the <hi>Dry-Martins, SpaniÅ¿h Bon-Chretiens,</hi> with the <hi>Apples</hi> of all kinds, of <hi>Capendu,</hi> either Grey, or Red, or White, the <hi>Apples</hi> of <hi>Fenouillet, Autumn Calvils,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>Apis,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Reynettes,</hi> &amp;c. all theÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to ripen at the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> and a little YellowneÅ¿s, together with Å¿ome Wrinkles diÅ¿covers it Å¿elf upon the Six firÅ¿t, by which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48210:185"/>
we may judge, in caÅ¿e that they do not reÅ¿iÅ¿t the <hi>Thumb,</hi> that they are fit to Eat, but until then, we muÅ¿t not venture to meddle with them; in cutting of them, the Knife would Å¿oon diÅ¿cover their want of RipeneÅ¿s; thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Pears</hi> are very Subject to Å¿often, and thereby are certainly apt to deceive thoÅ¿e who do not Å¿trictly Examine them every day.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Dry-Martins,</hi> and <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Bon-Chretiens,</hi> it is with them in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> juÅ¿t as what I am going to Å¿ay in <hi>January</hi> for the <hi>Portail-Pears,</hi> as Å¿oon as ever there appears the leaÅ¿t Spot of RotteneÅ¿s upon any of them, you may boldly attack them all, their time is come, and they are Å¿oon threaten'd with RottenneÅ¿s; but yet with this advantage, that they remain a pretty while in the State of perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Capendu, Fenouillet,</hi> and <hi>Reinettes,</hi> declare their Maturity as Å¿oon as they become extreamly wrinkled, the <hi>Apis</hi> declare theirs when their Green Colour turns to Yellow.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Calvils</hi> Å¿eem to become lighter, and their kernel looÅ¿Å¿ens, and rattles in Å¿haking, when they ripen, they remain good a long while, as well as the <hi>Reinettes,</hi> which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Yellow, without wrinkling, and, thoÅ¿e are admirable qualifications in thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>People muÅ¿t not grow weary of often feeling the tender melting <hi>Pears</hi> of that SeaÅ¿on, the lazy and negligent thereby fall into great Inconveniences.</p>
                        <p>Such <hi>Fruits</hi> as have reÅ¿iÅ¿ted the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> will final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield to it in their turns in the Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> but when the <hi>Winter-Thorns,</hi> are not able to change their Colour a little in theÅ¿e Months, they become Mealy and InÅ¿ipid, and in a Word, periÅ¿h without attaining a perfect Maturity, which is a cruel loÅ¿s to the Curious, Å¿ince it is really one of our beÅ¿t <hi>Pears.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have made very conÅ¿iderable ObÅ¿ervations in relation to it, and of Å¿ome others, in the TreatiÅ¿e of the Choice and Proportion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>LouiÅ¿e-bonnes,</hi> and the <hi>Long-Greens,</hi> of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> Å¿eldom grow Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but they wrinkle, and become Å¿oft, mellow, and agreeable to feel.</p>
                        <p>Many <hi>Ambrets</hi> Å¿often, before they grow Yellow, particularly Å¿uch as grow <hi>North-ward,</hi> or upon <hi>Dwarf-Å¿tandards,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially upon <hi>Trees Graffed</hi> upon free <hi>Stocks,</hi> that are too full, therefore theÅ¿e, as well as all other <hi>Pears</hi> which grow upon <hi>Northern EÅ¿paliers,</hi> require Sugar above all others, to correct their TaÅ¿te, which is not Å¿o good as it Å¿hould be, tho they are Å¿o very full of Water.</p>
                        <p>The large <hi>Winter-Musky,</hi> and the <hi>Portail-Pears</hi> have Å¿ome Friends, neither of them Value the skill of the <hi>Thumb,</hi> but the YellowneÅ¿s of the firÅ¿t, and a few wrinkles, or Å¿ome RotteneÅ¿s in the Å¿econd, to Invite their Votaries do make uÅ¿e of their merit, what ever it be.</p>
                        <p>One of the chief things I mind in ordering my <hi>Fruits</hi> in the <hi>Store-HouÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervatory,</hi> is not only to place every kind upon different Shelves, or when I do put Å¿everal upon one, they are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h'd by diviÅ¿ions of Edges, but I likewiÅ¿e make the Å¿ame diÅ¿tinction among <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Å¿ame kind; firÅ¿t I place thoÅ¿e that are fallen before their time (for I do not fling them away) by themÅ¿elves, out of Å¿ight, they Å¿eldom look well, by reaÅ¿on of their growing very much wrinkled, indeed Å¿ome more, and others leÅ¿s, and that according to their dropping, Å¿ooner, or later; but yet they ripen at laÅ¿t, tho pretty long after the others of their kind; and I cannot forbear doing of them the JuÅ¿tice to Å¿ay, that they are pretty often incomparably good under a wither'd, ugly, wrinkled <hi>Rind,</hi> eÅ¿pecially when their fall does not exceed a Month before the time of the common gathering.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, Pears</hi> growing upon <hi>Dwarf-Standards</hi> are apart, as well as thoÅ¿e of good <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I follow the Å¿ame Method for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>High-Standards,</hi> and the Å¿ame for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Northern EÅ¿paliers,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that regularly the <hi>Fruits</hi> of good <hi>EÅ¿paliers</hi> ripen firÅ¿t; thoÅ¿e of Vigorous <hi>Dwarfs</hi> follow them in this order, thoÅ¿e of <hi>Dwarfs Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince-Stocks</hi> preceed thoÅ¿e that are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Free-Stocks,</hi> and thoÅ¿e of Infirm <hi>Trees</hi> preceed both the one and the other.</p>

                        <p>As for the Baking-<hi>Pears,</hi> they are good at all times, for the end they are deÅ¿ign'd for, particularly when they begin to grow yellow; with this ProviÅ¿o, that all Å¿uch as are tainted with RottenneÅ¿s, muÅ¿t be laid aÅ¿ide, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould infect thoÅ¿e that are Å¿ound; and thus the <hi>Franc-Reals, Little Certeau,</hi> the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> or <hi>Mazuer,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the <hi>Double-BloÅ¿Å¿oms,</hi> which muÅ¿t be conÅ¿ider'd as the beÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e that are only fit to bake, are almoÅ¿t ready at all times to perform their part: The <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>Angobers, Catillac, Fontarabie, &amp;c.</hi> may chance to acquire Å¿ome goodneÅ¿s, being Å¿eaÅ¿on'd with Sugar, and the heat of the Fire, but they Å¿till retain a touch of TartneÅ¿s, which can never agree with nice Pallats.</p>

                           <p>Of the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is apparent, that by a Law UniverÅ¿ally EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, all Living Animated Beings are Å¿ubject to Å¿ome Accidents, which hinder them from enjoying a perpetual, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways equally Vigorous health; this is the reaÅ¿on that it is not only among Men, and other Animals, we find different DiÅ¿tempers: <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and more particularly <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> are likewiÅ¿e Å¿ubject to certain Infirmities that deÅ¿troy them, which we may very well term DiÅ¿tempers; yellow <hi>Leaves</hi> out of SeaÅ¿on, new <hi>Shoots</hi> growing black, and dying on their Extremities in the Months of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and <hi>September, Fruits</hi> remaining Å¿mall, or dropping of themÅ¿elves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are, as the PhyÅ¿icians term it, Å¿o many Å¿peaking Symptoms, informing us of the indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the <hi>Foot.</hi> Among thoÅ¿e Infirmities, there are Å¿ome that may be Cur'd with the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of Å¿ome Remedies, and others which hitherto appear Incurable; Å¿ince whatever can be done to them, has Å¿till prov'd Ineffectual, perhaps time may produce Å¿ome Skilful PerÅ¿on, whoÅ¿e Knowledge and Experience may give us Å¿ome light, in a CaÅ¿e which expoÅ¿es us to Å¿corn, or at leaÅ¿t to pity. In the mean time, Å¿ince it is but too true that our <hi>Trees</hi> are liable to different DiÅ¿tempers, <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> would certainly be blame-worthy, if they did not make it their Study to find out effectual Remedies for Å¿ome, and to Å¿atisfie themÅ¿elves as to the others; and if knowing thoÅ¿e Remedies, they were not careful to apply them upon occaÅ¿ion: For it were vain for them to breed <hi>Trees</hi> in their <hi>Gardens,</hi> to be liable to Å¿ee them periÅ¿h in their prime, for want of knowing how to Cure them, and reÅ¿tore them to their priÅ¿tine Vigour.</p>
                        <p>In Order not to omit any thing relating to thoÅ¿e Accidents which our <hi>Trees</hi> are liable to, without including Å¿uch as proceed from too long wounds, of great Heat, of great Cold, of Storms, of Whirlwinds, Hails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think my Å¿elf oblig'd to Å¿ay, in the firÅ¿t place, that there are DiÅ¿tempers common to all <hi>Trees</hi> in general; Secondly, that there are Å¿ome that are peculiar to every particular kind: The common DiÅ¿tempers conÅ¿iÅ¿t either in a defect of Vigour, which makes the <hi>Trees</hi> appear in a languiÅ¿hing Condition, or elÅ¿e in a Å¿torm of large white Worms, which are Å¿ometimes form'd in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and there gnaw the <hi>Roots,</hi> or the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Neighbouring <hi>Stem;</hi> thoÅ¿e miÅ¿chievous little InÅ¿ects which we call <hi>Tons,</hi> by degrees cauÅ¿e Å¿o great a diÅ¿order, that the <hi>Tree</hi> which is attack'd by them, and had always appear'd Vigorous before, all on a Å¿uddain dies without any Remedy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48210:186"/>
The Peculiar DiÅ¿tempers are, for Example, in <hi>Pear-Treees</hi> againÅ¿t a Wall, when their <hi>Leaves</hi> are attack'd with what we call <hi>Tigers:</hi> Cankers, and Scabs in other <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> Viz. <hi>Robins,</hi> Å¿mall <hi>MuÅ¿cadins, &amp;c.</hi> Gum on Stone-<hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> eÅ¿pecially <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> which commonly deÅ¿troys that part on which it fixes, either <hi>Branch,</hi> or <hi>Stem;</hi> and when, unfortunately it attacks the part where the <hi>Tree</hi> is graffed, which is often hid under ground, it inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly Å¿preads round about that <hi>Graff,</hi> without any bodies obÅ¿erving of it, for the <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿till continues in a good Condition, while there remains any paÅ¿Å¿age for the <hi>Sap;</hi> but, finally, this Gum hindering this <hi>Sap</hi> from riÅ¿ing to the upper parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> makes that <hi>Tree</hi> die Å¿uddenly, as if it had been Å¿uffocated by a kind of Apoplectick Fit.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Å¿ome <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are alÅ¿o attack'd with Aemets, and a Å¿mall kind of green Fleas, which Å¿ometimes faÅ¿ten on the young <hi>Shoots,</hi> and hinder them from thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; Å¿ometimes on the new <hi>Leaves,</hi> and cauÅ¿e them firÅ¿t to Å¿hrink, next to dry, and fall: We have likewiÅ¿e <hi>North-EaÅ¿t</hi> Winds which blaÅ¿t, in Å¿ome Springs wither, and as it were burn all the new <hi>Shoots;</hi> inÅ¿omuch, that the <hi>Trees</hi> on which this unlucky In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence lights, appears dead, while others about them are green, full of fine <hi>Leaves,</hi> and continue to produce fine <hi>Shoots:</hi> BeÅ¿ides this, are not the moÅ¿t Vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿ubject to have the end of their new <hi>Shoots</hi> intirely cut off by a little black round InÅ¿ect, call'd <hi>Bud-Cutter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fig-<hi>Trees</hi> dread the great Colds of the Winter, which are capable of Freezing their whole head, unleÅ¿s they be extreamly well Cover'd, but it is not Å¿ufficient to have Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them againÅ¿t FroÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>They are likewiÅ¿e Å¿ubject in that Winter SeaÅ¿on, to have the lower part of their <hi>Stems</hi> gnaw'd by <hi>Rats,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">LiÅ¿ete.</note> 
                           <hi>Mulots</hi> which makes them pine, and die.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e very Animals, together with <note n="*" place="margin">Garden-Mice.</note> 
                           <hi>Laires,</hi> Ear-wigs, and Snails, likewiÅ¿e Å¿poil the very <hi>Fruit</hi> on the <hi>Trees</hi> when they approach to maturity, eÅ¿pecially <hi>Peaches,</hi> and <hi>Plums;</hi> have not <hi>GooÅ¿berry-Å¿hrubs</hi> their peculiar Enemies alÅ¿o, which are a kind of Å¿mall green Caterpillars, which form themÅ¿elves towards the Months of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> on the back part of their <hi>Leaves,</hi> and eat them to that degree, that thoÅ¿e little <hi>Shrubs</hi> remain altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bare; and their <hi>Fruit</hi> no longer having any thing to cover and defend them from the great heats of the Sun, is deÅ¿troy'd, without being able to Ripen.</p>
                        <p>I might run over all the Accidents which all the reÅ¿t of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> is liable to, and cauÅ¿e abundance of DiÅ¿orders in it: For Example, <hi>Strawberry-Plants</hi> in the prime of their Youth and Vigour, are as it were treacherouÅ¿ly attack'd in their very <hi>Roots</hi> by thoÅ¿e wicked <note n="*" place="margin">WeeÅ¿els.</note>

                           <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> eÅ¿pecially <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and <hi>Succory, &amp;c.</hi> conÅ¿tantly have Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e <note n="*" place="margin">ThoÅ¿e uÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by the Name of Cock-Chafers.</note> 
                           <hi>Tons,</hi> or other little reddiÅ¿h Worms which gnaw them about the neck, and kill them juÅ¿t as they come to perfection.</p>
                        <p>How much do <hi>Artichokes</hi> Å¿uffer by little black Flies which infeÅ¿t them towards the end of Summer, and <hi>Mulots,</hi> or <hi>Garden-Mice,</hi> which gnaw their <hi>Roots</hi> in the Winter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and <hi>Succory</hi> are abÅ¿olutely devour'd by Snails, Å¿ome of which are long, and yellow, Å¿ome blackiÅ¿h, and gray, and others little and white, eÅ¿pecially in Rainy Weather.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sorell</hi> is tormented in very hot weather with little Black Fleas, which gnaw all the <hi>Leaves,</hi> inÅ¿omuch that it becomes of no uÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>Even <hi>Cabbages</hi> are Å¿poil'd by green Snails, which gnaw and Å¿poil all their <hi>Leaves;</hi> but I am only to Å¿peak in this place, of thoÅ¿e DiÅ¿tempers that may be Cur'd in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and not of Å¿uch as are Incurable, nor of thoÅ¿e that are incident to <hi>Kitchen-Plants;</hi> thoÅ¿e commonly proceed, either from the defect of the Ground, which does not furniÅ¿h nouriÅ¿hment enough, or from an ill <hi>Culture,</hi> or a defect in <hi>Pruning,</hi> or finally, from a defect in the <hi>Tree,</hi> which was not well-condition'd, either before it was Planted, or in Planting of it.</p>
                        <p>It therefore follows, in the firÅ¿t place, that the <hi>Soil</hi> may contribute to DiÅ¿temper our <hi>Trees,</hi> which commonly happens when the <hi>Earth</hi> is not Fruitful in it Å¿elf, or is perhaps become Å¿o by being exhauÅ¿ted, or when it is too dry, or too moiÅ¿t; or elÅ¿e when, tho' never Å¿o good, there is not a Å¿ufficient quantity of it.</p>
                        <p>In order to remedy all thoÅ¿e kind of Inconvenients, I Å¿ay, that when the <hi>Soil</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertile, as it happens in many places, where there is nothing but clear Sand, the MaÅ¿ter is to blame to have Planted any thing in it, the defect of it can never be Corrected, whatever quantity of Dung he puts into it; the only Expedient is to remove that <hi>Earth,</hi> and put better <hi>Mould</hi> in the room of it: Happy are thoÅ¿e who can meet with it in their Neighbourhood, and thereby avoid the Trouble and Charge of fetching it at a diÅ¿tance. As to that which is worn out, it is likely that there may be Å¿ome better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

it which may be us'd, unleÅ¿s People would allow it two or three years time to lie <hi>Fallow,</hi> in order to amend it by reÅ¿t, but there is no pleaÅ¿ure in loÅ¿ing Å¿o much time: When we reÅ¿olve to make this Exchange of <hi>Mould,</hi> and yet are unwilling to remove the <hi>Tree</hi> which is not Old, one half of the <hi>Roots</hi> muÅ¿t be <hi>Prun'd</hi> short again, which will Å¿uffice for the firÅ¿t Year, doing the Å¿ame again at the end of two years, to the other half of the <hi>Tree:</hi> Nothing ExhauÅ¿ts the Ground more than the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> lying long in the Å¿ame place, eÅ¿pecially the <hi>Roots</hi> of Neighbouring <hi>Trees,</hi> particularly Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ado's of <hi>Elms; Fruit-Trees</hi> muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity Pine, or PeriÅ¿h, if that Neighbourhood Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts.</p>
                        <p>When the Ground is too dry, and light, the beÅ¿t Remedy is to Å¿oak it often with frequent Waterings, or by Artificial falls of Water, or elÅ¿e by ordering Spouts, or, Dreins in Å¿uch a manner, that they may Conduct the Water of Rains into the Squares and Bordures, as I have explain'd it in the <hi>TreatiÅ¿e</hi> about Soils.</p>
                        <p>When the Ground is too moiÅ¿t, that part muÅ¿t be rais'd where the <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿tand, making lower Ridges to receive the Waters, and Conduct them out of the <hi>Gardens</hi> by <hi>Gutters,</hi> or <hi>Aqueducts,</hi> as I have done in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>VerÅ¿ailles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When there is not <hi>Mold</hi> enough, it muÅ¿t be augmented, either about the <hi>Roots,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all the ill <hi>Mould,</hi> to put better in the room of it; or elÅ¿e laying new <hi>Mould</hi> over the Surface of it; the <hi>Mould</hi> being thus amended, without doubt the <hi>Trees</hi> will thrive better in it, and grow more Vigorous.</p>
                        <p>When the diÅ¿temper is only viÅ¿ible by a certain yellowneÅ¿s, as for Example; <hi>Pear-Trees Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince-</hi>Stocks, in certain Grounds, always grow yellow, tho' the Ground Å¿eems to be pretty good; it is a good and certain AdvertiÅ¿ement to remove them, and to place others in their room upon <hi>Free-Stocks,</hi> which are much more Vigorous, and agree better in an indifferent <hi>Soil,</hi> than others.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Peaches Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Almond-</hi>Stocks, caÅ¿t too much Gum in moiÅ¿t Grounds, others muÅ¿t be Planted upon <hi>Plum-</hi>Stocks, and when they do not thrive upon <hi>Plum-</hi>Stocks in Sandy Grounds, only Å¿uch muÅ¿t be Planted there, as are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If, on the other hand, the <hi>Tree</hi> appears over-burthen'd with <hi>Branches,</hi> Å¿o as only to Å¿hoot very Å¿mall ones, it muÅ¿t be eas'd, until it begins again to produce fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> always performing that <hi>Pruning,</hi> by lowering the uppermoÅ¿t <hi>Branches,</hi> or by removing part of thoÅ¿e that cauÅ¿e a ConfuÅ¿ion in the middle, obÅ¿erving the Maxims I have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for good <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the DiÅ¿temper proceeds from the <hi>Trees</hi> being ill-Condition'd before its being <hi>Planted;</hi> as for inÅ¿tance, from its having a Scabby poor <hi>Foot,</hi> half dead for want, or from its being too weak, the beÅ¿t way is to pull it out, and place a better in the room of it.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Tree,</hi> being good in it Å¿elf, has been Planted too deep, or too Å¿hallow, or with too many <hi>Roots,</hi> the beÅ¿t expedient is to take it up again, <hi>Prune</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> a-new, and Re-plant it according to the Rules of Art.</p>
                        <p>And to all theÅ¿e Ends, it is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to keep always Å¿ome Dozens of good <hi>Trees</hi> in Baskets, to place new ones ready grown in the room of Å¿uch as muÅ¿t be remov'd.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Trees</hi> are attack'd with Å¿ome Cankers, you muÅ¿t with the point of a Knife remove the part Å¿o tainted to the quick, and then apply a little Cow-Dung to it, covering it with a piece of Linen, a kind of <hi>Rind</hi> will grow over it, which will cover the Wound, and Å¿o that Accident will be Cur'd.</p>
                        <p>When Catterpillars annoy a <hi>Tree,</hi> Care muÅ¿t be taken to remove them.</p>
                        <p>When Rats gnaw the Barks, Snares and Traps muÅ¿t be laid for them.</p>
                        <p>When the DiÅ¿temper is Å¿uppos'd to proceed from <hi>Tons,</hi> the Foot of the <hi>Tree</hi> muÅ¿t be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to Extirpate them abÅ¿olutely, putting new <hi>Mould</hi> in the room of the old, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Å¿hortned the <hi>Roots</hi> that are gnaw'd.</p>
                        <p>Among the Incurable DiÅ¿tempers of our <hi>Trees,</hi> I reckon firÅ¿t Old Age; when for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, a <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> or <hi>Plum-Tree</hi> has Å¿erv'd for Thirty, Forty, or Fifty years, we may conclude that it has attain'd a decrepit Age, and conÅ¿equently, that it has perform'd its part, and is out of date, there is no hopes of a return, it muÅ¿t be taken out, not leaving any of its <hi>Roots</hi> into the Ground, putting new <hi>Mould</hi> into the room of it, in order to Plant new <hi>Trees</hi> there, when People are deÅ¿irous of Å¿eeing <hi>Trees</hi> in the Å¿ame Place.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd place, I reckon the <hi>Tigers</hi> which Å¿tick to the back of the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Wall-Pear-Trees,</hi> and dry them up by Å¿ucking all the green Matter that was in them, among the Incurable DiÅ¿tempers; I have imploy'd all manner of Å¿trong, Å¿ower, corroÅ¿ive, Å¿tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lees, <hi>Viz.</hi> of Rue, Tabacco, Salt, Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to waÅ¿h the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Branches:</hi> I have, by the Advice of Å¿ome of the Curious, imploy'd Oyl; I have Å¿moak'd them with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48210:187"/>
BrimÅ¿tone by the Advice of others; I have burnt the Old <hi>Leaves,</hi> I have Å¿crap'd the back of the <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>Stem,</hi> to which the Seed Å¿ticks: I daily endeavour to find out Å¿ome new Expedient; and after all, I confeÅ¿s freely, and to my Å¿hame, that I have never Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in any of them; there Å¿till remains Å¿ome of the Seed of that CurÅ¿ed InÅ¿ect, in Å¿ome part or other: And in the Months of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> this Seed is hatch'd by the heat of the Sun, and then multiplies <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> and therefore one of theÅ¿e two things muÅ¿t be done; either no <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿uffer'd againÅ¿t a Wall, or in <hi>EÅ¿palier,</hi> which is a violent Remedy, eÅ¿pecially for Å¿mall <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Pears, Burgamots,</hi> and Winter <hi>Bon-Chretiens,</hi> which Å¿eldom thrive from a Wall; or elÅ¿e we muÅ¿t reÅ¿olve to Å¿ee thoÅ¿e <hi>Tigers</hi> upon them, contenting our Å¿elves with burning all the <hi>Leaves</hi> yearly, and with cleanÅ¿ing the <hi>Trees</hi> as much as is poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I reckon among the Incurable DiÅ¿tempers the Gum, which faÅ¿tens to <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and other <hi>Stone-Fruits;</hi> when it only appears on one <hi>Branch,</hi> it is no great matter, 'tis but cutting the Å¿aid <hi>Branch</hi> two or three inches below the part Å¿o DiÅ¿temper'd; whereby this kind of Gangreen is hinder'd from extending farther, as it would Infallibly do, if it Å¿tuck about the <hi>Graff,</hi> or all over the <hi>Stem,</hi> or on moÅ¿t of the <hi>Roots,</hi> and then the Å¿ole Expedient is to loÅ¿e no more time about it, and conÅ¿equently to remove Å¿uch a <hi>Tree</hi> out of the Ground, in the manner aforeÅ¿aid:</p>
                        <p>The Gum Å¿ometimes proceeds from an external Accident, for inÅ¿tance, from a Wound which has been made by way of InciÅ¿ion, by a Scratch, and Å¿ometimes from an Evil inward diÅ¿poÅ¿ition: In the firÅ¿t CaÅ¿e, that Gum is nothing but a Å¿purted <hi>Sap,</hi> which is Å¿ubject to Corruption, and RottenneÅ¿s, from the time it ceaÅ¿es to be inclos'd in its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Channels, which lye between the Wood, and the <hi>Bark;</hi> in that CaÅ¿e the Remedy is eaÅ¿ie, eÅ¿pecially when it happens only on a <hi>Branch,</hi> as I have declar'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Article, when the DiÅ¿temper affects the <hi>Stem,</hi> it often Cures it Å¿elf by a knob, or a Continuation of new <hi>Bark,</hi> which extends over the part Å¿o Wounded; Å¿ometimes it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to apply a PlaiÅ¿ter of Cow-dung over it, cover'd with a piece of Linen, until the Wound be clos'd: When the Gum proceeds from the inÅ¿ide, I judge it Incurable on the <hi>Stem,</hi> or <hi>Roots.</hi>

                           <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Oratour, conformably to many others among the Learned, who had explain'd themÅ¿elves upon that Å¿ubject before him, has taken delight inÅ¿peaking of that Invention, in terms Å¿o Noble, and Å¿o Elegant, that PoÅ¿terity has been Charm'd with it: In effect, he expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es the Å¿ingular eÅ¿teem he had for it, very agreeably, and yet without Å¿eeming to inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon the praiÅ¿e of its AncientneÅ¿s, being willing as it were by his Å¿ilence to incline us to believe that the Original of it is hardly known, and that without doubt we are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to Chance for it; and indeed our Books of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> hardly mention any thing capable of giving us any agreeable uÅ¿eful inÅ¿ight into it; for, as for inÅ¿tance, what Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it to believe, with <hi>TheophraÅ¿tus,</hi> that we have receiv'd the firÅ¿t Idea of <hi>Graffing</hi> from the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Trunk</hi> of a <hi>Tree's</hi> having produc'd another <hi>Tree</hi> of a different kind? That Author, who, to maintain his Opinion, lays a great Å¿treÅ¿s upon that Adventure, delights in reciting the whole Story at length; for which ReaÅ¿on, he adds, that a Bird having Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd a whole <hi>Fruit,</hi> had afterwards voided it again accidentally in the hollow of that Old <hi>Tree,</hi> and that the Rains mixing with Å¿ome rotten part of that hollow had made it Å¿prout and grow, inÅ¿omuch that it was become a new <hi>Tree</hi> of the Å¿ame kind of that whence this <hi>Fruits</hi> was Originally grown, which conÅ¿equently was abÅ¿olutely different from that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                           <p>What Å¿ignifies it likewiÅ¿e for me to believe, with <hi>Pliny,</hi> that this Invention of <hi>Graffing</hi> proceeds rather from that a Plough-Man, who was a good Husband, being deÅ¿irous to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a piece of Land againÅ¿t the Spoils, he dreaded from without, unleÅ¿s his Field was well inclos'd, had fenc'd it round about with a PalliÅ¿ade of green Poles, and that in order to Å¿ecure thoÅ¿e Poles from rottenneÅ¿s, thereby to make them laÅ¿t the longer, he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himÅ¿elf of laying into the ground round about that Field <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Ivy,</hi> with a deÅ¿ign to intermix, as he did, the inferiour Extremity of thoÅ¿e Poles into the Body of thoÅ¿e <hi>Trunks,</hi> from whence it happen'd, contrary to his expectation, that the <hi>Sap</hi> which was in the internal parts of thoÅ¿e <hi>Trunks,</hi> Å¿erv'd for a nouriÅ¿hment to thoÅ¿e Poles, juÅ¿t as if it had been a piece of good <hi>Earth,</hi> inÅ¿omuch that in proceÅ¿s of time, they grew to be large <hi>Trees.</hi>

                           <p>It were perhaps to be wiÅ¿h'd, in the CaÅ¿e of <hi>Graffs,</hi> that People had been Å¿atisfy'd with the bare improvement of that fine Invention, without puÅ¿hing it to exceÅ¿s, and tormenting themÅ¿elves to produce monÅ¿trous <hi>Fruits</hi> by a world of Projects, as ridiculous, as uÅ¿eleÅ¿s; our Books have endeavour'd to perÅ¿wade us about the Å¿ucceÅ¿s thereof, but Ingenious Men give but little Credit to them: I believe there are but few, who upon the Report of Å¿ome of the Ancients, have made it their buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to <hi>Graff Vine</hi> upon <hi>Wallnut,</hi> or <hi>Olive-Trees,</hi> in hopes to get Bunches of Oyl, or to <hi>Graff</hi> good <hi>Fruits</hi> upon <hi>Plain-Trees,</hi> or <hi>AÅ¿h,</hi> and <hi>Cherries</hi> upon <hi>Lawrel, CheÅ¿nuts</hi> upon <hi>Beach Trees, Oaks,</hi> upon <hi>Elms, Wallnuts</hi> upon a <hi>Shrub,</hi> and all in hopes of raiÅ¿ing new kinds of <hi>Fruits;</hi> and therefore, tho' with Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, and reÅ¿pect to the memory of Great Men, I muÅ¿t needs Å¿ay, that all their Attempts have for the moÅ¿t part been faulty; it is Å¿ufficient that all good kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> may be <hi>Graffed</hi> with Å¿ucceÅ¿s,

Next, you muÅ¿t chuÅ¿e a fine Place upon the Å¿aid <hi>Twig,</hi> having two good <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> looking regularly the one on one Å¿ide, the other on the other, and with your <hi>Graffing-Knife,</hi> or other Å¿harp InÅ¿trument you muÅ¿t cut the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Piece you are to take off for the <hi>Graff,</hi> Circularly to the very <hi>Wood,</hi> both at the top and bottom; you muÅ¿t take off all the <hi>Bark</hi> which covers the Å¿malleÅ¿t part of the Å¿aid <hi>Twig,</hi> in order to make that Piece come out there, which is to be taken off after having looÅ¿en'd it from its <hi>Wood,</hi> by twiÅ¿ting it gently with the <hi>Thumb:</hi> But before you take it quite out of its Place, you muÅ¿t Å¿horten the <hi>Branch</hi> that is to be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon, four or five Inches, and without wounding the <hi>Wood,</hi> you muÅ¿t Å¿trip it intirely in a very Å¿ound, and very Å¿mooth place, unto the lower part where the <hi>Graff</hi> is to come, that it may fit it Å¿o exactly, that it may rather be thought it grew there Naturally, than by Art, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, in order not to permit a Å¿mall MoiÅ¿ture which lyes round about the part Å¿o Å¿tript, which is the <hi>Sap</hi> newly riÅ¿en, to Evaporate, you muÅ¿t make an end of taking the piece that is deÅ¿ign'd for the <hi>Graff,</hi> out of its Place, and Lodge it with all the Diligence, and dexterity imaginable within the <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿o Å¿tript, to the place where 'tis to remain, and <note place="margin">Huc aliena ex Arbore ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men includunt, udoque docent inoleÅ¿cere libro. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> finally to hinder the moiÅ¿ture of the Air from penetrating into the Å¿pace between the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Graffed,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> that is newly applied, you muÅ¿t raiÅ¿e Å¿mall Shavings out of the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Branch</hi> round about the Superiour Extremity of that <hi>Graff,</hi> without putting them off, and make them hang like a kind of Ruff on the Extremity of that <hi>Bark,</hi> to cover, and Å¿helter it from the Injuries of the Air.</p>

                           <p>The DeÅ¿cription of the <hi>Cleft</hi> we have in the <hi>Georgicks,</hi> tho' admirable in it Å¿elf, might <note place="margin">Aut rurÅ¿um enodes trunci reÅ¿ceantur, &amp; altÃ© finditur in Å¿olidum cuncis via: deinde Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races plantae immittuntur; nec longum tempus, &amp; ingens exiit ad caelum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis foelicibus arbos, <hi>Georg.</hi> 2</note> yet be much better, if it were more compleat, more particular, and more inÅ¿tructive; it only tells us, that in order to Perform this <hi>Graff,</hi> the head of the <hi>Trees</hi> muÅ¿t be cut off, in that part where the <hi>Stem</hi> appears moÅ¿t even, and leaÅ¿t knotty, that we muÅ¿t cleave the Å¿aid Stock pretty deep with Wedges, and finally, that we muÅ¿t lodge <hi>Cyons</hi> of better <hi>Fruits</hi> into thoÅ¿e <hi>Clefts,</hi> which in time produce fine large <hi>Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Reading of that DeÅ¿cription does not appear Å¿ufficient to me, to InÅ¿truct a new Learner in the Art of <hi>Graffing,</hi> to perform it as it Å¿hould be, it is deficient in Å¿everal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it does not inform us that we may not only <hi>Graff</hi> upon thick Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd <hi>Stocks,</hi> but alÅ¿o that it may be done upon Å¿everal <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or tall <hi>Standards,</hi> even upon <hi>Stocks</hi> of two or three Inches Circumference, provided they be capable of Å¿uffering the <hi>Cleft,</hi> and of cloÅ¿ing the <hi>Graff</hi> Å¿ufficiently.</p>
                           <p>It is defective in the Second place, in not Å¿pecifying the proper time for thoÅ¿e kind of <hi>Graffs.</hi> We have explain'd it already.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, It is defective, in not fixing the length of the <hi>Twigs</hi> that are employ'd about it: We commonly regulate it to two or three Inches in length, or rather upon the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three good <hi>Buds</hi> at leaÅ¿t, which the <hi>Graff</hi> muÅ¿t have.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, it is deficient, in neither teaching us how to <hi>Prune</hi> the <hi>Graffs</hi> well, nor how to place them Å¿o exactly in the only places that are proper for them, that the <hi>Sap</hi> of the Foot may enter Å¿ecurely into them: As for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of thoÅ¿e <hi>Graffs,</hi> in order to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it well, the Butt-end of them muÅ¿t be Cut with a very Å¿harp <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> on both Å¿ides in the form of a Wedge, about half a large Inch in length, preÅ¿erving on the two Å¿ides which Edge that Figure of a Wedge, Å¿ome <hi>Bark</hi> Å¿ticking very cloÅ¿e to the <hi>Wood;</hi> the Å¿ide which is to be moÅ¿t outward muÅ¿t be Å¿omewhat broader, and thicker, than the other which is inward, and preciÅ¿ely on the top of that <hi>Bark</hi> preÅ¿erv'd for the outÅ¿ide, you muÅ¿t have a good <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> as high as the edge of the Å¿horten'd <hi>Stock,</hi> and the upper part of the <hi>Cleft;</hi> and as to the well-placing of the <hi>Graffs,</hi> the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Barks,</hi> both of the <hi>Wildling,</hi> and of the <hi>Graffs,</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿o exactly Å¿itted, that the <hi>Sap</hi> riÅ¿ing from the <hi>Foot,</hi> may as eaÅ¿ily enter into the Å¿pace between the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Graff,</hi> as between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Stock,</hi> or <hi>Branches Graffed</hi> upon.</p>
                           <p>The DeÅ¿cription is likewiÅ¿e deficient, in the Fifth place, in not obÅ¿erving, that in caÅ¿e the <hi>Cleft</hi> be not made very curiouÅ¿ly, as it happens often, you muÅ¿t pare it with your <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Knife,</hi> removing whatever might obÅ¿truct or hinder the <hi>Graff</hi> from entring freely, nay more, in caÅ¿e there be cauÅ¿e to judge that the <hi>Graff,</hi> by being a little too Å¿mall, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Stock,</hi> may be a little too much preÅ¿s'd, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to pare the wood on both Å¿ides of the <hi>Cleft</hi> very neatly, and very Å¿moothly, which is to be done with the point of a very Å¿harp <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> beginning from the lower part upwards, and all this Å¿o exactly, and Å¿o conformably to the Figure of the <hi>Branch</hi> that has been cut for the <hi>Cleft Graff,</hi> that after having lodg'd the <hi>Graff,</hi> there may appear no vacuity between it, and the Å¿ides of the <hi>Cleft;</hi> and yet, that the <hi>Graff</hi> may Å¿tick Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that it may not be eaÅ¿ie to move it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48210:191"/>
Sixthly, The DeÅ¿cription is defective, in not mentioning how many <hi>Graffs</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd upon one <hi>Stock,</hi> and how the upper part of the <hi>Stem</hi> being Cut muÅ¿t be prepar'd; large <hi>Stocks,</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> that are to be <hi>Graff'd</hi> in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> muÅ¿t be very Å¿mooth at top, and equal on all Å¿ides, inÅ¿omuch that the head may be Horizontal, to place Å¿everal <hi>Graffs</hi> upon it, if there be room, and the <hi>Stock</hi> requires it; Å¿mall <hi>Stocks,</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> that cannot receive above one <hi>Graff,</hi> muÅ¿t only be Å¿mooth'd in one part of the Head; and if that part where the <hi>Graff</hi> is to be apply'd, the remainder muÅ¿t be Cut like the Foot of a Hind.</p>
                           <p>Finally, the Å¿aid DeÅ¿cription is defective in not informing us how to Å¿ecure our <hi>Graff'd Trees,</hi> and hinder them from being prejudic'd by the Injuries of the Air, Rains, Heats, and Droughts, through the overtures of the <hi>Cleffs,</hi> whereupon it is to be noted, that all <hi>Cleft Graffs</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿wadled with fine <hi>Earth,</hi> and Hay newly prepar'd, or elÅ¿e with Gum prepar'd to that end, compos'd either of black fat Pitch, melted in an Iron Pot, or <hi>Earth</hi> mix'd with a little yellow Wax, the Å¿aid Gum muÅ¿t be kept hot, and liquid, over a Chaffing-DiÅ¿h, to be apply'd with a kind of Wooden Trule; but before you apply either the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> or the Gum, you muÅ¿t cover all the Crannies with Å¿ome Barks, immediately looÅ¿en'd from Å¿ome <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> that is <hi>Graffed;</hi> they are commonly put croÅ¿swiÅ¿e on large <hi>Stocks,</hi> or <hi>Graff'd Branches,</hi> in order to cover the <hi>Clefts</hi> Å¿o well, that nothing may get into them; and whereas we generally cover the <hi>Earth,</hi> and Hay, with a piece of Linnen to keep it fix'd about the Head that is <hi>Graff'd,</hi> which has Å¿ome reÅ¿emblance to a Child's Baby, we often call the Cleft <hi>Graff</hi> a Baby-<hi>Graff: Nota,</hi> that when the Stock does not Å¿eem to preÅ¿s the <hi>Graff</hi> Å¿ufficiently, it muÅ¿t be bound about with Å¿ome tender Twigs of an Ozier, in order to Å¿ecure the <hi>Graff.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I conclude what relates to Cleft <hi>Graffs,</hi> after having declar'd what I can Å¿ay about Wedges; which is, that before you make uÅ¿e of them to open the Cleft, you muÅ¿t, in caÅ¿e it be a large <hi>Stock,</hi> begin the Cleft with the edge of a pretty large Knife, apply'd upon the whole breadth of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> or <hi>Branch,</hi> Å¿triking with a Hammer upon it, in order to make the Å¿aid edge enter pretty deep into the <hi>Wood,</hi> and thereby mark the <hi>Cleft</hi> in queÅ¿tion: <hi>Stocks</hi> of a moderate Å¿ize are eaÅ¿ily enough <hi>Cleft</hi> with the bare edge of the Knife, without the help of a Hammer.</p>
                           <figure/>
                           <p>The Wedges to be Convenient muÅ¿t be made according to the Model of this Figure, one of the Hooks being thicker, longer, and Å¿tronger than the other, which is to Å¿erve for large <hi>Stocks,</hi> and the other being both Å¿horter, Å¿maller, and weaker, for Å¿mall ones: In order to uÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Wedges, that which Å¿eems beÅ¿t proportion'd for the <hi>Stock</hi> that is to be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon, muÅ¿t be plac'd in the middle of the <hi>Cleft</hi> that is begun, and when it cannot enter Å¿ufficiently, to make the Overture that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, it muÅ¿t be driven in with a Hammer: In fine, the <hi>Cleft</hi> being partly large enough, to lodge the <hi>Graff</hi> into it, you muÅ¿t raiÅ¿e or pull down the end of the Tool that Å¿erves for a Wedge, with the left hand, in the mean time, with the right, placing the <hi>Graff,</hi> Cut as aforeÅ¿aid, to the place where it is to remain; and thus you may make an end of Å¿tretching, or cloÅ¿ing the <hi>Cleft,</hi> according as you may judge it proper, when the <hi>Graff,</hi> or <hi>Graffs</hi> are plac'd as they Å¿hould be. I need not tell you, that one <hi>Cleft</hi> may Å¿erve to place two <hi>Graffs</hi> oppoÅ¿ite to one another, and when two more can be plac'd, a Å¿econd <hi>Cleft</hi> may be made CroÅ¿wiÅ¿e upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> altogether like the firÅ¿t, uÅ¿ing the Å¿ame Method preÅ¿crib'd about the two firÅ¿t <hi>Graffs.</hi>

                           <p>We Å¿ometimes call it <hi>Graffing</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> when we place four <hi>Graffs CleftwiÅ¿e</hi> upon a <hi>Stock,</hi> that is large enough to receive them Conveniently; but it is more particularly call'd Å¿o, when upon very large Å¿horten'd <hi>Stocks</hi> we place a greater number of <hi>Graffs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Bark,</hi> for inÅ¿tance, 6, 7, 8. and therefore this kind of <hi>Graff,</hi> as well as that we call <hi>Whip-Graffing</hi> can only be perform'd upon Å¿uch <hi>Stocks</hi> as exceed three or four Inches Diameter, which cannot be <hi>Cleft;</hi> but we Å¿eldom uÅ¿e either of them, by reaÅ¿on that the Å¿ucceÅ¿s is very uncertain, and the trouble of making them very ConÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;

                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To make a <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>Plum-Trees,</hi> you muÅ¿t only <hi>Plant</hi> the <hi>Suckers</hi> of certain <hi>Plum-Trees, viz, St. Julian, Black-Damask,</hi> the little <hi>Cherry-Plum,</hi> thoÅ¿e that are large enough to bear it, are <hi>Graffed</hi> in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> and the leÅ¿Å¿er with the <hi>Scutcheon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Good <hi>Seminaries</hi> for <hi>Peaches,</hi> muÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿t of <hi>St. Julian,</hi> and <hi>Black Damask Plum-Trees,</hi> which muÅ¿t be <hi>Inoculated</hi> or <hi>Budded</hi> in the Months of <hi>July</hi> or <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> or young <hi>Almond-Trees,</hi> that is, <hi>Almond-Trees</hi> grown from an <hi>Almond Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

in good Grounds in the <hi>VVinter</hi> time, grown about <hi>September</hi> following half an Inch thick, to be <hi>Budded</hi> at that time: Old <hi>Almond-Trees</hi> of two or three Years Å¿tanding are hot proper to be <hi>Graffed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, to make <hi>NurÅ¿eries</hi> of red <hi>Stone-fruit,</hi> viz. <hi>Cherries, Griottes, Bigarreaux;</hi> no <hi>Stocks</hi> are Å¿o proper as <hi>MeriÅ¿iers,</hi> which is a Å¿mall wild bitter <hi>Cherry,</hi> eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as beat whitiÅ¿h ones; the <hi>Sap</hi> of the black ones is commonly Å¿o bitter, that the <hi>Graffs</hi> of good <hi>Cherries</hi> do not take upon them, or always pine away.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Suckers</hi> which Å¿pring from the <hi>Roots</hi> of other <hi>Cherries</hi> may Å¿erve to <hi>Graff</hi> good <hi>Cherries</hi> upon, but they are moÅ¿t proper to be <hi>Graffed</hi> with early <hi>Cherries.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sixthly, <hi>Fig-Tree Seminaries</hi> are Planted with <hi>Suckers</hi> Å¿prouted from the <hi>Foot</hi> of Old <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> or with <hi>Branches</hi> of two years Å¿tanding laid into the <hi>Ground,</hi> and notch'd in that part which is moÅ¿t bent, and laid into that <hi>Ground.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventhly,</hi> for the <hi>NurÅ¿ery</hi> of <hi>Azeroles,</hi> you muÅ¿t only Plant <hi>White-Thorn,</hi> and Å¿ome few <hi>Quince-Å¿tocks.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Eighthly, no <hi>NurÅ¿eries</hi> are made for <hi>Vines,</hi> they are Å¿eldom <hi>Graffed</hi> otherwiÅ¿e than upon Old <hi>Plants,</hi> ready Planted.</p>
                           <p>Finally, for <hi>Medlars,</hi> People Å¿eldom make any particular <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> the leaÅ¿t quantity of them is Å¿ufficient, a dozen <hi>Wildlings</hi> of that kind, or <hi>White-Thorn,</hi> or <hi>Quince-Å¿tocks;</hi> are Å¿ufficient to provide for the LargeÅ¿t <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Before I proceed to the Sixth Part, I think it will not be altogether improper to give my Opinion about the different kinds of <hi>Lattices,</hi> to the end that People may determine at firÅ¿t to pitch upon that which I value moÅ¿t, and indeed, which is the moÅ¿t Noble, and moÅ¿t Convenient.</p>

                              <p>Of the different manners of <hi>Lattices</hi> us'd to <hi>PalliÅ¿ade.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>FRom the very Moment we reÅ¿olve to EncloÅ¿e our <hi>Garden</hi> with Walls, we certainly deÅ¿ign to have <hi>Fruit</hi> againÅ¿t them, and conÅ¿equently muÅ¿t prepare whatever is neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary <note place="margin">Pole Lattices Å¿et up againÅ¿t Walls, much us'd in <hi>France.</hi>
                              </note> to <hi>PalliÅ¿ade</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> that are to be Planted there, neatly, and Conveniently.</p>
                           <p>The FirÅ¿t ObÅ¿ervation I have made in Relation thereto, is, that one cannot be too careful in having the Walls well Pargetted, or PlaiÅ¿tred over when it can be done Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently; in order to Å¿top all the holes from <hi>Rats, Snails, Earwigs,</hi> and other Vermin which deÅ¿troy the <hi>Fruits,</hi> and commonly attack the FaireÅ¿t, and beÅ¿t, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Plague the Curious.</p>
                           <p>When the Walls are Pargetted with PlaiÅ¿ter, we have the Convenience to Ply, or Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿ade the <hi>Branches</hi> with Nails, and Shreads of Sheep's-Skin, or Shamoy, or LiÅ¿ts of Cloath, both about half a finger broad, and a finger long againÅ¿t the Å¿aid Walls, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Stays about the <hi>Branch,</hi> and fixing it upwards with a Nail, we thus form the Figure of our <hi>Trees.</hi> This manner of <hi>PalliÅ¿ading</hi> is very agreeable, but tedious; thoÅ¿e Shreads may laÅ¿t a year or two, the only thing that can be Å¿aid againÅ¿t it is, that Å¿ometimes <hi>Earwigs</hi> Å¿helter in them in the day time, and come out at Night, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage the <hi>Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>ThoÅ¿e who are not willing to uÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Shreads, have try'd three or four ways of <hi>PalliÅ¿ading,</hi> Å¿ome for all manner of Walls, but eÅ¿pecially for Å¿uch as are made of Earth, and Hey, as they do in <hi>BeauÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> Å¿ome fix Spikes from Å¿pace to Å¿pace into the <hi>Wall,</hi> Å¿ticking out about two Inches, to faÅ¿ten Laths, Poles, Perches, or Switches upon them: Others make a <hi>Lattice</hi> of Poles, Å¿upported by the Bones of HorÅ¿es, or Oxen, fix'd into the Wall, to which they faÅ¿ten the <hi>Branches</hi> of their <hi>Trees:</hi> Others have abundance of Sheeps feet Bones fix'd into their Walls at a Å¿mall diÅ¿tance, in a Å¿traight Line, and Å¿o bind every <hi>Branch</hi> of their <hi>Tree</hi> to one of the Å¿aid Feet; Å¿ome make a <hi>Lattice</hi> of narrow Laths nail'd a croÅ¿s one another checker-wiÅ¿e, every Å¿quare conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of about twelve Inches; and this <hi>Lattice</hi> being made by whole, or half Fathoms, Å¿eparate, they fix them to the Walls with Nails, or Hooks, that are driven into the joynts of the Stones; it is a pretty good Expedient, but neither Gentile, nor HandÅ¿om.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48210:193"/>
Some who yet covet cheapneÅ¿s beyond theÅ¿e, make a <hi>Lattice</hi> of BraÅ¿s or Iron Wire, of a moderate Å¿ize, Å¿upported by flat-headed Nails fix'd into the Walls. Others have been Å¿atisfy'd with barely fixing Å¿treight Lines of this Wire, either longwiÅ¿e, or croÅ¿swiÅ¿e: TheÅ¿e two laÅ¿t Methods are pretty neat, but not very good; both by reaÅ¿on that they are too weak, inÅ¿omuch that the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> that Å¿ometimes require to be forc'd, either break, of<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Å¿tretch them; and that this Wire is apt to wound and Å¿cratch the young, and conÅ¿equently tender <hi>Branches,</hi> which occaÅ¿ions Gum to grow upon them, which deÅ¿troys them; beÅ¿ides, thoÅ¿e young Shoots Å¿lip too eaÅ¿ily behind thoÅ¿e Wires, from whence it is not eaÅ¿ie to remove them, without Å¿poiling of them.</p>
                           <p>The beÅ¿t manner of all, the moÅ¿t Convenient, and moÅ¿t Noble, is a <hi>Lattice</hi> of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wood, or Heart of Oak; every Pole or Lath about an Inch Å¿quare, and as much as can be without knobs, they muÅ¿t be very well plain'd, and notch'd in Å¿uch places as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; thoÅ¿e that are not plain'd, are courÅ¿e, and ugly. I confeÅ¿s that this <hi>Lattice</hi> is chargeable at firÅ¿t, but then it is more laÅ¿ting, and requires leÅ¿s mending: The Å¿quare fathom of that <hi>Lattice</hi> amounts conÅ¿tantly to 25, 26, 27, and 28 Pence, for the Wood, Making, Wire and all.</p>
                           <p>In order to make this <hi>Lattice</hi> as it Å¿hould be, you muÅ¿t have Iron Hooks made on purpoÅ¿e, they muÅ¿t be Å¿quare, about a quarter of an Inch thick, and half a Foot long; beÅ¿ides, the end which turns upwards in a Å¿treight Angle, which muÅ¿t be above an Inch and a half long, the end which enters into the Wall, muÅ¿t be forked, to hold the faÅ¿ter into the Wall, into which it muÅ¿t enter about four Inches deep, two Inches on the outÅ¿ide will Å¿uffice.</p>
                           <p>ThoÅ¿e Hooks coÅ¿t commonly about a Penny a piece, they muÅ¿t be plac'd at three foot diÅ¿tance, and always Checker-wiÅ¿e, beginning the firÅ¿t Row within a foot of the Å¿urface of the Ground, continuing it to the top of the Wall; the rows of thoÅ¿e Hooks muÅ¿t lie in a Å¿treight Line, and parallel to one another; that is all I have to Å¿ay about the Hooks.</p>
                           <p>As to the Poles, or Laths, you may buye them in Shops, of different lengths, <hi>Viz.</hi> Of Four Foot and a half, of Six, Seven, Eight, or Nine; Å¿ome are made of twelve Foot, but Å¿eldom, becauÅ¿e it is too difficult to Å¿lit Å¿uch long pieces of Wood; you may take them of what length you pleaÅ¿e, according to the heighth of your Walls; they are Sold in Bundles, thoÅ¿e of Four Foot and a half, contain Forty, and CoÅ¿t Eleven Pence, thoÅ¿e of Six, coÅ¿t Twelve Pence, and contain Five and Twenty; thoÅ¿e of Seven, Eight, and Nine; likewiÅ¿e contain Twenty Five, and coÅ¿t Å¿omewhat more.</p>
                           <p>The beÅ¿t and moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful way is to make thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand upwards all of a piece, when you can, but yet you may joyn two or three, Å¿uch as you can get, and they are much cheaper; they muÅ¿t be joyn'd together neatly, plaining and proportioning the Extremities that are to be Marry'd together exactly, tying them afterwards very cloÅ¿e with Wire; to which end, you muÅ¿t uÅ¿e Å¿mall Pinchers made on purpoÅ¿e, with which you may pull the Wire towards you, and turn and wind it until the Ligature be Å¿trong enough, then break the end cloÅ¿e to the knot, and faÅ¿ten the Å¿aid knot againÅ¿t the Laths, leÅ¿t it Å¿hould prejudice the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or <hi>Branch.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In chuÅ¿ing the Poles, or Laths, take the Å¿treighteÅ¿t, and weakeÅ¿t, to Å¿erve in a Å¿treight Line, by reaÅ¿on that they always appear on the outÅ¿ide, placing the Butt-end downwards; the Å¿trongeÅ¿t muÅ¿t be imploy'd croÅ¿swiÅ¿e to Å¿upport the Work; the Squares of the <hi>Lattice</hi> muÅ¿t be regularly about 7 or 8 Inches, they do not look well of ten or twelve Inches, and in my Opinion, they are too little of 5 or 6 Inches for <hi>EÅ¿paliers;</hi> but they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for thoÅ¿e kind of Arbors, that are of late in faÅ¿hion. A good Maker of <hi>Lattice</hi> Å¿hould never work without a regulated meaÅ¿ure in hand for his Checkers, meaÅ¿uring every one of them carefully; he muÅ¿t leave an Inch between the Laths, and the Wall, and when the Hooks are too Å¿hort, he muÅ¿t make uÅ¿e of a Wooden Wedge, and hold it between the Laths, and the Wall, in order to have more room to paÅ¿s his Wire.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Lattice</hi> muÅ¿t not only appear neatly made to the Eye, it muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be Å¿olid, which is eaÅ¿ily known by Å¿haking one of the Laths; for it is not as it Å¿hould be unleÅ¿s it reÅ¿iÅ¿ts the hand.</p>
                           <p>I muÅ¿t not forget to tell you, that you muÅ¿t uÅ¿e but one Å¿traight Lath in Corners, to faÅ¿ten the two <hi>Lattices</hi> of two Walls that joyn, two would look clumÅ¿ily, the one on one Å¿ide of a Wall, the other, on the other.</p>
                           <p>The laÅ¿t Perfection of our <hi>Lattice</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in being painted firÅ¿t with White, and when that is dry, with a fine Mountain Green.</p>
                           <p>We do not only make <hi>Lattice</hi> frames for <hi>Walls,</hi> we likewiÅ¿e make them Å¿ometimes for a kind of <hi>Counter-EÅ¿palier,</hi> or <hi>Pole-Hedges,</hi> which <hi>Lattice</hi> frames may be made four, five, or Å¿ix foot high, according as you pleaÅ¿e: In Order to its being Å¿olid, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿tick
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48210:194"/>
Oaken Spikes into the Ground, at five or Å¿ix foot diÅ¿tance from one another, about four Inches Å¿quare, driving them about a foot deep into the ground, the outward Extremity being pointed, to laÅ¿t the longer, for if it were Å¿quare, the Rain would Rot it the Å¿ooner; as for the Å¿ize, and the place to faÅ¿ten the Wire, the Checkers muÅ¿t be like thoÅ¿e of the <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> with this only difference; that in <hi>Pole-Hedges,</hi> the Poles or Laths muÅ¿t be fix'd with Nails into the Body of the <hi>Spikes,</hi> which muÅ¿t be notch'd in order thereunto.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I anÅ¿wer, that I will not deny but that almoÅ¿t as Å¿oon as there were Men upon the Earth, they had Å¿ome kind of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> and that in proceÅ¿s of time, the curioÅ¿ity of their Cultivation has been extreamly augmented, and has made mighty advances, and I am far from pretending, that the firÅ¿t Å¿owing of <hi>Sallets,</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> and planting of <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and <hi>Artichokes,</hi> and rearing of <hi>Cucumbers, Melons,</hi> &amp;c. begun in our days. No, I know well enough, that our <hi>AnceÅ¿tours</hi> underÅ¿tood what belonged to the Culture of all thoÅ¿e plants, and that the moÅ¿t part of the very <hi>Country-people,</hi> and of the meaner Å¿ort of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48210:195"/>
of <hi>Cities,</hi> have Å¿ome Tincture of it; nay, and I will ingenuouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿s, that the knowledge I have my Å¿elf in the management of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> was chiefly attained by my often converÅ¿ing with what we vulgarly call, able <hi>Market-Gard'ners.</hi> But I muÅ¿t add withall that as the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> taken in a general Å¿ence, comprehends the Culture of a great number of different Å¿orts of Plants, Å¿o there is hardly any Gard'ner that has made it his BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, to be skilful in cultivating generally all the Å¿orts of them; it having ordinarily hapned, that one has applyed himÅ¿elf to the care and improvement of one particular part of this culture, which he has performed exactly well, neglecting the reÅ¿t, whilÅ¿t another has employed his induÅ¿try, no leÅ¿s particularly in that which his Neighbour had neglected, and Å¿ucceeded in it, as much Å¿ighting on his Å¿ide, that other part in which the Å¿ame Neighbour had Å¿o proÅ¿perouÅ¿ly laboured; the different appetites of Men, but more eÅ¿pecially, the different goodneÅ¿s of Soils and Climates, having been the true cauÅ¿es of thoÅ¿e different affectations in the Cultivation of <hi>Pot</hi> or <hi>Kitchen-Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now it being undoubtedly neceÅ¿Å¿ary for a Gentleman's Gard'ner to be able to perform with equal skill and happineÅ¿s, all the parts of Culture belonging to a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> that Å¿o he alone may be in a condition to furniÅ¿h his MaÅ¿ter with all the variety that a good <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> can produce, without wanting at leaÅ¿t any of thoÅ¿e productions that are of moÅ¿t importance, and it being no leÅ¿s expedient too for the Gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to know exactly what he may expect from his Gard'ner every Month in the Year, and what is the particular work that is to be done in every SeaÅ¿on; I have therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to omit nothing that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for either of them to be informed in, that the one may be able to give content by knowing how perfectly well to diÅ¿charge his Duty, and the other be contented, when he knows he has Å¿ufficient ReaÅ¿on to be Å¿o. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, by way of anÅ¿wer to thoÅ¿e, that may ask me what I pretend to Å¿ay that is new, upon a Subject which I my Å¿elf confeÅ¿s to be Å¿o very well known,</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hall firÅ¿t repeat the Å¿ame thing which I have already laid down, and inculcated, as my intention in all the parts of this Work, viz. That I write not here for thoÅ¿e which are actually Gard'ners by ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, and that are skillful in it, but for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction, as well of thoÅ¿e that have a mind to become Å¿o, as for Gentlemen that are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Gard'ning, being well aÅ¿Å¿ured there are a great many of theÅ¿e Latter, though ignorant in the particulars of this Science, that eÅ¿teem it not unworthy of their CurioÅ¿ity, and are fully perÅ¿waded it is capable of giving them PleaÅ¿ure as well as Profit, and being no leÅ¿s certain, that I my Å¿elf found a great deal in purÅ¿uing the acquiÅ¿ition of thoÅ¿e lights I have attained in it, therefore I cannot but think, it will be Å¿weet and gratefull to them to enjoy without Pains, the Fruits of the Å¿tudy I have made therein, and to find out an exact and faithful Collection of all that concerns this matter.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd Place, I Å¿hall anÅ¿wer, that 'tis my deÅ¿ign to cut out a Å¿horter way than the common Roads, for thoÅ¿e young PerÅ¿ons who though very deÅ¿irous of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Art of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> yet would willingly be inÅ¿tructed by Å¿ome other means than by bare Å¿eeing others Practice, it being a tedious and uncertain way, and had rather be taught by Å¿tated Rules and Principles, which, I think may be done in a little time, and by very Å¿hort and eaÅ¿ie methods.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I reply, that I Å¿hall Å¿et down here Å¿ome particular experiments which I my Å¿elf have made with SucceÅ¿s, and which Å¿eem to me never to have been made before, and I think I may add, that they have been too well approved, not to merit to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged.</p>
                        <p>LaÅ¿tly, I anÅ¿wer, that my intention is to give Å¿uch Directions, that the place deÅ¿igned for a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> may be Å¿o well ordered in all its parts, that not only each part may perform its duty in reÅ¿pect of its Productions but by the accurate <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> obÅ¿erv'd in modelling of the whole, it may be in a Condition to allure the <hi>Spectators,</hi> and at all times to delight the Eyes of the Curious.</p>
                        <p>And accordingly for theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons, I purpoÅ¿e here to follow exactly the Model and Platform I have already delineated and explained at the beginning of theÅ¿e TreatiÅ¿es of Gard'ning, conformably to which, I Å¿hall Å¿et down,</p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, every thing that generally Å¿peaking, Å¿hould be in all Å¿orts of good and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniÅ¿ht <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> to which I Å¿hall add a DeÅ¿cription of the Seeds and other things which Å¿erve for the Production and Multiplication of every particular Plant.</p>
                        <p>In the Å¿econd place, I Å¿hall Å¿pecifie not only all the things that may be gathered out of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> every Month of the Year, but alÅ¿o what work Gard'ners are to do in every one of thoÅ¿e Months, and to thoÅ¿e two heads I will joyn another, <hi>viz.</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of what Å¿hould at all times be found in any <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> whatÅ¿oever, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48210:195"/>
Å¿o we may be able to judge when there is any thing wanting in it, and when not.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I will explain what Å¿ort of Earth or Soil, and what Å¿ort of Culture are moÅ¿t proper for each Å¿ort of plants, to make them excellent; and becauÅ¿e Å¿ome of them are Å¿own to remain always in the Å¿ame place, and Å¿ome, only to be tranÅ¿planted elÅ¿ewhere, and Å¿ome again are propagated without Seed; I will give Directions at the Å¿ame time how to order all of them, as well in reÅ¿pect to the SeaÅ¿ons in which they are to be Å¿own or planted, as the manner of their Propagation.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, I will Å¿hew how long each Å¿ort may profitably occupy its place, and which of them muÅ¿t be laid up in Å¿tore for our <hi>Winter</hi> ProviÅ¿ion, and which may by the help of InduÅ¿try be produced in Å¿pite of the FroÅ¿ts.</p>
                        <p>And fifthly and laÅ¿tly, I will inform you how long any Å¿ort of Seed will laÅ¿t without Å¿poiling, they having not all the Å¿ame deÅ¿tiny in that Matter.</p>

                           <p>What things Å¿hould be planted in any <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of a reaÅ¿onable extent, to render it compleatly furniÅ¿hed.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>ALL the World is agreed, that there are few days in the whole Year in which we can be well without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> whether it be in the fair and fruitful SeaÅ¿on, whilÅ¿t they are Å¿till growing on the Earth that firÅ¿t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, when we have no more to do but to go and gather them there; or in <hi>Winter</hi> when we muÅ¿t fetch them out of the Store-rooms, where we had timely laid them up for Security, before the arrival of the bitter cold, which not only makes the Earth unfruitful for a time, but deÅ¿troys too a great part of thoÅ¿e Vegetables which are Å¿o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be within its reach; and therefore it follows, that every day of the Year, we muÅ¿t be furniÅ¿ht with what we need of this Nature, out of our own Gardens of Stores, or elÅ¿ewhere, either by the liberality of our Friends, or what is moÅ¿t common from the Markets.</p>
                        <p>That you may therefore have at one view, the knowledge of what compoÅ¿es this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, that may be drawn out of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden.</hi> I Å¿hall here preÅ¿ent you with a kind of <hi>Alphabetical Inventory</hi> of all the things that Å¿uch a Garden Å¿hould, and may furniÅ¿h us with, throughout the whole courÅ¿e of the year.</p>

But notwithÅ¿tanding all thoÅ¿e hindrances, there is Å¿till work enough to be done in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to keep us from being quite idle, and a great deal of AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance too to be drawn from our Gardens, even in that SeaÅ¿on, that we may not labour under too great a Å¿car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Productions; and therefore I have determined to give you a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every one of thoÅ¿e works, and of every one of thoÅ¿e Commodities which our Gardens will afford us, during every one of the twelve Months of the Year, and Å¿hall begin with that which, becauÅ¿e it paÅ¿Å¿es for the firÅ¿t, and opens and begins the Year, Å¿eems to me beÅ¿t to deÅ¿erve the preference.</p>

                              <p>And as to the way of making <hi>hot Beds,</hi> you muÅ¿t firÅ¿t know, they are to be made only with <hi>Long HorÅ¿e-Dung,</hi> or <hi>Mule-Dung,</hi> which is to be either all <hi>New,</hi> or mixed with a third part at moÅ¿t of <hi>Old,</hi> provided it be dry, and not rotten, for that which is rotten, is not at all proper for making <hi>hot Beds,</hi> no more than the Dung of <hi>Oxen, Cows, Hogs,</hi> &amp;c. as well, becauÅ¿e it has little or no heat, as becauÅ¿e ordinarily thoÅ¿e kinds of rotten Dung are accompanied with an unpleaÅ¿ing Å¿mell that infects the Plants raiÅ¿ed upon Å¿uch <hi>Beds,</hi> and gives them an ugly TaÅ¿te.</p>
                              <p>By <hi>New Long Dung,</hi> is to be underÅ¿tood, that which is taken from under the <hi>HorÅ¿es,</hi> and has Å¿erved them for <hi>Litter</hi> but one Night or two at moÅ¿t.</p>
                              <p>By <hi>Long old Dung,</hi> is meant that which has been piled up ever Å¿ince it was new, in a dry place where it has lain all Summer, to be ready to be uÅ¿ed, either to make Coverings for <hi>Fig-trees, Artichoaks, Endive,</hi> &amp;c. againÅ¿t the <hi>Winter</hi> Cold, or to make <hi>hot Beds</hi> after the ordinary manner, which is thus performed.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48210:200"/>
After we have mark'd and proportioned out the place where the <hi>Bed</hi> is to be, and mark'd out likewiÅ¿e with a Cord, or with Stakes, of what breadth it muÅ¿t be, there muÅ¿t be brought a Rank of Baskets full of <hi>Long Dung,</hi> one at the tail of the other, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Rank or Row where the <hi>Bed</hi> is to end; which done, the Gard'ner begins to work where the Rank of Baskets ends, that Å¿o the <hi>Dung</hi> not being intangled with any thing lying upon it, may more eaÅ¿ily and handÅ¿omly be wrought into the <hi>Bed.</hi> Then the Gard'ner takes up this <hi>Dung</hi> with a Fork, and if he be any thing handy, places it Å¿o neatly and tightly in laying every layer of his <hi>Bed,</hi> that all the Å¿traw ends of the <hi>Dung,</hi> are turned inwards, and what remains, Å¿erves to make a kind of back or fence on the out-Å¿ide. The firÅ¿t layer being thus compleated exactly to the breadth that is marked out, which is commonly of about four foot, and to Å¿uch a length as is thought fit, the Gard'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proceeds to lay the Å¿econd, third, &amp;c. beating them with the back of his Fork, or elÅ¿e treading them with his Feet, to Å¿ee if there be any defect, becauÅ¿e the <hi>Bed</hi> muÅ¿t be equally Å¿tuft every where, Å¿o that no one part may be leÅ¿s Å¿trong of <hi>Dung</hi> than another, which being done, he continues it to the deÅ¿igned length, proportioning it Å¿till by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, till the <hi>Bed</hi> reach the length, breadth, and heighth it Å¿hould have, which heighth is of between two and three foot when 'tis firÅ¿t made, and Å¿inks a full foot lower when it is Å¿etled.</p>
                              <p>Now as to the intention of theÅ¿e <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> Å¿ome of them are deÅ¿igned for the raiÅ¿ing, or forwarding of Å¿ome plants which our <hi>Climate</hi> is not capable naturally of producing in the naked Ground, as for example, for the raiÅ¿ing of <hi>RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> little <hi>Sallets, Straw-berries, Cucumbers, Musk-Melons,</hi> &amp;c. and the better to compaÅ¿s thoÅ¿e ends, we make <hi>Hot Beds</hi> during the Months of <hi>November, December, January, February, March</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> TheÅ¿e Beds muÅ¿t be covered over with a certain quantity of Å¿mall fine mold, as we Å¿hall afterward Direct, and muÅ¿t have heat enough to communicate to that mold, and to the plants that are nouriÅ¿hed by it; And therefore thoÅ¿e <hi>Hot Beds</hi> that are an Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gard'ners againÅ¿t the <hi>Cold,</hi> which is the cruel Enemy of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> muÅ¿t be well made.</p>
                              <p>In the Å¿econd place, there are other <hi>Beds</hi> which are to Å¿erve for <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms,</hi> in all the Å¿eaÅ¿ons of the Year, and Å¿uch may be made every Month, though they act not till about three Months after they are made; and that is, when all their great heat being quite Å¿pent, they are grown mouldy within; this Å¿ort of <hi>Beds</hi> are made in a new and Å¿andy Ground, in which is firÅ¿t made a Trench of about Å¿ix Inches deep, then we cover them with a layer of about two or three Inches thick of the Å¿ame Earth; they are raiÅ¿ed in the form of an <hi>AÅ¿Å¿es back,</hi> and over the covering of Earth, we lay another of five or Å¿ix In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick of <hi>Long Dry Dung,</hi> which Å¿erves in <hi>Winter,</hi> to Å¿helter the <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms</hi> from the <hi>FroÅ¿t,</hi> which deÅ¿troys them: and in <hi>Summer,</hi> from the great heat that broils them, and likewiÅ¿e to prevent the miÅ¿chievous effects of the Å¿ame exceÅ¿Å¿ive heat, we further take care gently to water theÅ¿e <hi>MuÅ¿hroom Beds</hi> twice or thrice a week.</p>
                              <p>As for the breadth of <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> it Å¿hould be in all Å¿orts of them, of about four foot, and their heighth muÅ¿t be of between two and three when they are firÅ¿t made, becauÅ¿e they Å¿ink afterwards a full foot, when once the great heat of the <hi>Bed</hi> is paÅ¿t; As for the length that is to be regulated by the quantity of <hi>Dung</hi> we have to make them with, Å¿o that according to that, we make them of Å¿everal lengths; But in heighth and breadth, all <hi>Beds</hi> Å¿hould be as near as may be, alike proportioned.</p>
                              <p>The difference which there is in other reÅ¿pects, between <hi>Hot Beds</hi> that are to produce plants by their heat, and thoÅ¿e which are deÅ¿igned for <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms,</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts firÅ¿t in that thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t Å¿ort need not be Å¿unk down within the Earth like the others, which are uÅ¿ually Å¿unk about half a foot, unleÅ¿s they be deÅ¿igned for Å¿uch <hi>Beds</hi> as we call <hi>Deaf Beds,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, <hi>Beds</hi> Å¿unk Å¿o over <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> into the Earth, that when filled up, they exceed not the Å¿uperficies of the reÅ¿t of the Ground about them, in height. In the Å¿econd place, this difference conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, in that thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t Å¿ort muÅ¿t be flat and even above, whereas theÅ¿e others muÅ¿t be raiÅ¿ed in form of an <hi>AÅ¿Å¿es Back.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>LaÅ¿tly, it conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in that thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t Å¿ort muÅ¿t be Loaden with a pretty good quantity of very Å¿mall mold, as Å¿oon as they are made, whereas there muÅ¿t be but a very little mold laid upon the others; That mold by its weight, makes the <hi>Beds</hi> heat, and Å¿ettle the Å¿ooner. We lay upon them Å¿ometimes more, and Å¿ometimes leÅ¿s mold; as for Example, we throw on to the quantity of Å¿ix or Å¿even Inches thick, if it be to Å¿ow ordinary plants in, as <hi>Sallets,</hi> or <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> or <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> or to plant <hi>Cabbage Lettuce,</hi> and <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> to be advanced by heat; and to the depth of a foot, if we be to Å¿ow <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿hes,</hi> and to replant <hi>Sorrel,</hi> and <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> and pots of <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48210:201"/>
But before we Å¿ow or replant any thing whatÅ¿oever upon any new made <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> the firÅ¿t precaution we muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve, is, to Å¿tay Å¿ix or Å¿even days, and Å¿ometimes ten or twelve, to give the <hi>Bed</hi> time firÅ¿t to heat, and afterwards to give time to that heat which is very violent, to abate conÅ¿iderably; This abatement appears when the whole <hi>Bed</hi> is Å¿unk, and when thruÅ¿ting down our hand into the mold, we perceive in it but a moderate heat. Then it is we are to begin handÅ¿omly to Å¿hape out and adjuÅ¿t the mold, for which purpoÅ¿e the Gard'ner, makes uÅ¿e of a board of a foot broad, which he places upon the Å¿ides of the <hi>Bed</hi> about two Inches from the Edge, and joining cloÅ¿e to the mold, and having thus placed it, he endeavours to keep it firm and tight, as well with his left hand and Knee, as with the Å¿trength of his whole Body, and then with his right hand, he begins at one end, to preÅ¿s down the mold againÅ¿t the board, Å¿o hard, till he bring it to Å¿o firm a conÅ¿iÅ¿tence, that how light and looÅ¿e Å¿oever it were before of its own Nature, yet it may be able to keep up it Å¿elf alone, when the board is taken away, as well as if it were a Å¿olid body. When the mold is thus adjuÅ¿ted to the whole length of the board, then he removes the board to another place, and Å¿o continues till he has performed the Å¿ame operation on all Å¿ides of the <hi>Bed.</hi> And if the board be a little longer, and conÅ¿equently a little more unwieldy than ordinary, then there muÅ¿t two or three perÅ¿ons join together to work in the Å¿ame manner, and at the Å¿ame time, to adjuÅ¿t this mold; or if the Gard'ner be all alone, he muÅ¿t keep the board tight with Å¿ome Pins, faÅ¿tned in the Å¿ides of the Dung <hi>Bed</hi> already adjuÅ¿ted; And when the thing is done, the mold Å¿hould have at leaÅ¿t a full half foot extent leÅ¿s on every Å¿ide, than the lower part of the <hi>Bed,</hi> and in its oblong Å¿quare figure, appear as even as if it were a <hi>Bed</hi> formed on the plain Ground; After which, the <hi>Beds</hi> are to be employed for thoÅ¿e occaÅ¿ions that firÅ¿t obliged us to make them. All things in them would either periÅ¿h, or be much endamaged, if we Å¿owed or planted in them Å¿ooner, or if we Å¿hould delay our doing it any longer. The heat of the <hi>Bed,</hi> may laÅ¿t in a condition to be able to perform well its effects for about ten or twelve days after it is Å¿own or planted; but when that time is paÅ¿t, if we perceive the <hi>Bed</hi> to be too much cooled, we muÅ¿t renew the heat with Å¿ome good new long dung, or freÅ¿h warm litter applied round about it, both to recruit the heat, and to maintain it afterwards in that good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in which it Å¿hould be, and in which it was before, when we begun to Å¿ow and plant there; Å¿o that the plants inÅ¿tead of waÅ¿ting away or periÅ¿hing there, may increaÅ¿e and thrive viÅ¿ibly as they Å¿hould do. It is not Å¿o very needful to tell you, that when a man has two <hi>Beds</hi> next one another, one recruiting of heat will Å¿erve for them both, becauÅ¿e there's no body but knows it, but it is good to know, that this recruiting of heat between two <hi>Beds,</hi> Å¿hould not be by a great deal Å¿o Å¿trong as when there is but one; for the ordinary Interval or Å¿pace left between two <hi>Beds</hi> for the path, being about the breadth of one full foot, a little Dung will Å¿uffice to fill it up, and that new heat is reciprocally maintained in its vigour by the Neighbour-hood of the two <hi>Beds,</hi> that border on each Å¿ide upon it; But when there is but one <hi>Bed,</hi> our addition of Dung for a new heat, muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t two foot broad, all along the whole length of the <hi>Bed,</hi> and to its full height, and many times it muÅ¿t be higher than that.</p>
                              <p>When we are to renew the heat, it is not always neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make an application of new Dung, it being many times Å¿ufficient to Å¿tir that the bottom upwards, which we laÅ¿t applied, and which needs it, provided it be not too much rotted, which Å¿tirring of it is enough to renew the heat for eight or ten days longer; and there is no need of applying new Dung but when by the rotting of all the laÅ¿t, or of at leaÅ¿t a good part of it, we find it to be no longer fit to yield that heat which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for thoÅ¿e plants that are raiÅ¿ed on <hi>Hot Beds.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If they be <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> or <hi>Straw-berries</hi> which we have taken out of their <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> and replanted in <hi>Hot ones,</hi> and there be any apprehenÅ¿ion of the Cold, we muÅ¿t care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cover them with <hi>GlaÅ¿s Bells,</hi> or <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> or <hi>GlaÅ¿ed Frames;</hi> and to hinder the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> from penetrating even them, and Å¿poiling what is underneath them, we uÅ¿e beÅ¿ides to cover them with Screens of dry Long Dung, or Litter, or <hi>Straw,</hi> which we put over the <hi>GlaÅ¿s Bells</hi> or <hi>GlaÅ¿ed Frames,</hi> and plants never fail to produce upon <hi>Beds</hi> thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated and maintained in a due heat, by Å¿uch recruitings Renewed from time to time.</p>
                              <p>This manner of proceeding is good and commodious enough for <hi>Sorrel;</hi> becauÅ¿e being animated by the moderate heat of the <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> it Å¿prings up there for Å¿ome fifteen days time, juÅ¿t as that do's that grows in the naked Ground in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and afterwards dies; But it is not Å¿o good for <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> becauÅ¿e they when they are pull'd
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48210:201"/>
up and Replanted, never produce Å¿uch fine Shoots, as when they are Dunged and heat on the naked Earth.</p>
                              <p>It follows then, that the beÅ¿t method for <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> and even for <hi>Sorrel</hi> too, is to take up for about two foot deep, all the Earth in the paths between two cold <hi>Beds,</hi> (which paths Å¿hould be a full foot broad) and fill them up afterwards with Long <hi>Warm</hi> Dung, to heat the neighbouring Earth, and if it be for <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> to cover the whole <hi>Cold Bed</hi> with the Å¿ame Dung, to help to warm the Earth; And when the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> begin to Å¿prout, we put <hi>Bells</hi> upon each plant, or elÅ¿e cover the whole <hi>Bed</hi> with <hi>GlaÅ¿ed Frames;</hi> after which, the heat of theÅ¿e paths muÅ¿t be renewed by Å¿tirring them the bottom upwards, or by renewing from time to time an application of freÅ¿h Dung, covering beÅ¿ides the <hi>Bells</hi> or <hi>GlaÅ¿s Frames</hi> with dry long Dung, or Screens of <hi>Straw,</hi> or Å¿uch like matter, for the reaÅ¿ons above expreÅ¿Å¿ed, when we were treating of <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> and <hi>Sorrel</hi> in <hi>Hot Beds.</hi> The <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> plants being thus warmed, and feeling under thoÅ¿e <hi>Bells</hi> or <hi>GlaÅ¿s Frames</hi> an Air as comfortable as in the Months of <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> they produce Å¿hoots that are Red at firÅ¿t comming up, but which afterward turn green and long, like thoÅ¿e that <hi>Nature</hi> it Å¿elf produces in warm and temperate Å¿eaÅ¿ons. The only inconvenience of theÅ¿e Artificial heatings is, that becauÅ¿e they muÅ¿t be very violent to penetrate a Cold Earth, they dry up and Å¿poil thoÅ¿e plants, Å¿o that Å¿uch <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> inÅ¿tead of continuing for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years together, to bear well as otherwiÅ¿e they do, never Å¿pring kindly afterward, and though they be let alone two or three years after a firÅ¿t heating, yet at moÅ¿t, are able to endure but one more.</p>

                              <p>As for <hi>Mint, Taragon, Cives,</hi> and other <hi>Furnitures</hi> of <hi>Sallets,</hi> they are planted on the <hi>Hot Bed</hi> in the Å¿ame manner as on the <hi>Cold</hi> one.</p>
                              <p>As for <hi>RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> we Å¿eldom Å¿teep them to make them Å¿prout, the skins of their Seeds being Å¿o tender, that in leÅ¿s than a days time, they would be melted all to a Pap.</p>
                              <p>I have directed how to Å¿ow <hi>RoaiÅ¿hes,</hi> in the Works of <hi>November,</hi> where we treat of preparing the proviÅ¿ions we would have from our <hi>Gardens</hi> in <hi>January, February,</hi> and <hi>March.</hi>

                              <p>It is convenient to Å¿ow in the beginning of this Month, or even in <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> of <hi>ParÅ¿ley</hi> to Å¿upply us with freÅ¿h, in the <hi>Spring</hi> time to Å¿erve us till that we Å¿hould Å¿ow in the naked Earth, at the end of <hi>February,</hi> be grown to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

To lay the branches or Å¿lips of <hi>Vines, Fig-Trees, GooÅ¿e-berry</hi> and <hi>Curran BuÅ¿hes,</hi> to take Root, we need only Couch, or lay down their branches into the Earth and cover them in the middle with Earth, to the height of five or Å¿ix Inches, which are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that condition, till the month of <hi>November</hi> following, when having taken Root, we take them up, that is, Å¿eparate them from the Tree, and plant them where we have occaÅ¿ion for them.</p>
                              <p>To <hi>CircumpoÅ¿e</hi> Trees by planting them in <hi>Baskets, Pots,</hi> and <hi>Boxes,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> we firÅ¿t fill half way with Earth thoÅ¿e <hi>Baskets, Pots,</hi> or <hi>Boxes,</hi> and then having pruned and trim'd the Trees as I have directed in the TreatiÅ¿e of Plantations, we Plant them, plunging the <hi>Baskets</hi> and <hi>Pots</hi> quite into the Earth, but leaving the <hi>Boxes</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> above Ground:</p>
                              <p>The way of potting the <hi>Bulbous</hi> Roots of <hi>TubereuÅ¿es, Juncquills, NarciÅ¿Å¿us</hi>'s of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantinople, Jacynths,</hi> &amp;c. is firÅ¿t to put them into <hi>Pots,</hi> and then to plunge thoÅ¿e <hi>Pots</hi> into <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> covering the <hi>Beds</hi> carefully with <hi>GlaÅ¿s Frames, Bells, Straw Screens,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>To warm or force <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> we muÅ¿t have Å¿ome in <hi>Boxes</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and make for them in <hi>January,</hi> a <hi>Deaf Hot Bed</hi> (being a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> made in a hollow dug into the Earth, and raiÅ¿ed only even with its Å¿urface) and place the <hi>Boxes</hi> upon it. Then we muÅ¿t have Å¿ome Å¿quare <hi>GlaÅ¿s Frames</hi> about Å¿ix or Å¿even foot high, which muÅ¿t be fitted purpoÅ¿ely to be applied againÅ¿t a <hi>Wall</hi> expoÅ¿ed to a <hi>Southern AÅ¿pect:</hi> And Å¿o the Dung in the <hi>Hot Bed</hi> fermenting into a heat, warms the Earth in the <hi>Box,</hi> and by conÅ¿equence, makes the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> Å¿prout; That <hi>Bed</hi> is to be put into a new ferment when there is occaÅ¿ion, and great care muÅ¿t be taken to cover thoÅ¿e <hi>GlaÅ¿s Frames</hi> cloÅ¿e, that no <hi>Cold</hi> may get within them.</p>
                              <p>During the whole Month of <hi>January</hi> we continue to Å¿ow upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> under <hi>Bells, Lettuces</hi> to be Replanted again as I have directed in the Works of <hi>December;</hi> as alÅ¿o to Replant them under <hi>Bells,</hi> as well to Å¿erve for the <hi>NurÅ¿ery,</hi> as in the places they are deÅ¿igned for, and as to the Seeds when Å¿own, we may let alone covering them with mold, if we pleaÅ¿e, it being enough to pat with the flat of our hands upon the <hi>Bed,</hi> to preÅ¿s the mold cloÅ¿e about them; we uÅ¿e the Å¿ame method with <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> Å¿own under <hi>Bells,</hi> for we can hardly throw Å¿o little mold upon thoÅ¿e Seeds to cover them, but we Å¿hall through too much.</p>
                              <p>To have Å¿ome fine little <hi>Lettuces</hi> for <hi>Salleting,</hi> we muÅ¿t Å¿ow under <hi>Bells</hi> Å¿ome of the <hi>Bright curled</hi> Å¿ort, and Å¿ow it thin, and Å¿tay till it has Å¿hot forth two leaves before we gather it. The Seeds of theÅ¿e <hi>Lettuces</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿own thin, that the Plants may grow tall, and if we Å¿ee them come up too thick, we muÅ¿t thin them; the choiÅ¿eÅ¿t Å¿orts of <hi>Lettuce</hi> for the <hi>Spring</hi> Å¿eaÅ¿on, are the <hi>Curled Fair</hi> or <hi>Bright Lettuce,</hi> and after that, the <hi>Royal Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>Short Lnttuce,</hi> and above all, the <hi>Shell Lettuce,</hi> &amp;c.

                              <p>The right method of making Trenches, and diging of molds, is not as was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practiÅ¿ed, firÅ¿t, to throw out of thoÅ¿e Trenches all the Earth, and then to throw it in again; for that was unprofitably to handle the Å¿ame Earth twice, and Å¿o to loÅ¿e time, and Å¿pend money to no purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                              <p>The beÅ¿t way to do it then, is to make at firÅ¿t a Gage full as broad as the Trench and of the length of a <hi>ToiÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Fathom,</hi> and to throw up upon the bordering Alley, all the Earth that is taken out of that <hi>Gage,</hi> which will be all the Earth we Å¿hall need handle twice, becauÅ¿e at the end of the Trench there will remain one <hi>Gage,</hi> empty, which muÅ¿t be filled up with the Earth that came out of the firÅ¿t, when the firÅ¿t <hi>Gage</hi> is made, we muÅ¿t fill it up with the Earth that is to be dug up to make the next, throwing that part of it into the bottom which was at the <hi>Superficies,</hi> and making a new <hi>Superficies</hi> of that which was at the bottom; This kind of moving the Ground, makes a natural Slope before the Workman, and in caÅ¿e the Soil muÅ¿t be Dunged, we muÅ¿t have Dung ready placed all along the Å¿ide of the Trench, and whilÅ¿t two or three men are at Work in turning up the Earth, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it before them, there muÅ¿t be one at the Å¿ide of the Trench, to Å¿catter Dung upon that Slope by which means the mold is well mixed, and not at all tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, as it is by common Gard'ners, that firÅ¿t lay a layer of Dung, and then a layer of Earth, and afterwards dig the whole over again, continuing this way of laying of layers of Dung and mold, and to turn up one over another, till their Trench be quite filled up as 'tis to remain.</p>

                              <p>If we have any <hi>Shell-Lettuces</hi> that were Å¿own in <hi>Autumn</hi> laÅ¿t, in Å¿ome well Å¿heltered place, we now replant them on <hi>Hot Beds</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> to make them <hi>Cabbage</hi> betimes.

                              <p>We begin to Graft all Å¿orts of Trees in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> and we prune and plant them; we plant alÅ¿o <hi>Vines,</hi> and about <hi>Mid-February,</hi> if the weather be any thing fair, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time to begin all Å¿orts of Works.</p>

                              <p>AT the beginning of this Month, it appears who are the Gard'ners that have been idle, by their not furniÅ¿hing us with any thing which the diligent and skilful ones Å¿upply us with, and by their having neglected to Å¿ow their Grounds which lie for the moÅ¿t part as yet unÅ¿own, though the weather has been favourable for it. There is now no more time to be loÅ¿t in delaying the Å¿owing of the firÅ¿t Seeds that are to be Å¿own in the naked Earth, and of which we have Å¿poken in the Works to be done about the end of <hi>February.</hi> Good Gard'ners ought to cover with Mold, the <hi>Cold Beds</hi> which they have Å¿own with their deÅ¿igned Seeds, for fear the waterings and great Rains Å¿hould beat down the Earth too much, and render its Superficies too hard for the Seeds to pierce and Å¿hoot through; they Å¿hould alÅ¿o bank up their cold Beds tightly with a rake, that Å¿o the Rain water, or that of their waterings may keep in them, and not run out of them into the Paths; and in fine, if they have never Å¿o little of the Spirit of NeatneÅ¿s in them, they will not fail to take away all the Stones the Rake meets with in its way.</p>

The way to cover well all theÅ¿e Seeds with Earth, is to harrow or rake, that is, to move it extreamly to and fro, which is commonly done with an Iron Rake.</p>
                              <p>About <hi>Mid-March</hi> at furtheÅ¿t, we make the <hi>hot Beds</hi> in which we are to replant the earlieÅ¿t <hi>Musk melons.</hi>

                              <p>We Å¿ow <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> in the naked Earth, among all the other Seeds we are Å¿owing, becauÅ¿e they do no harm there, but are fit to be gathered at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> before either the <hi>Sorrel, Chervil, ParÅ¿ly, Ciboule, &amp;c.</hi> be grown big enough to Å¿uffer any incommodity by them.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow <hi>Arrach,</hi> or <hi>Orage,</hi> in the naked Earth.</p>
                              <p>About <hi>Mid-March,</hi> we Å¿ow <hi>Citruls</hi> or <hi>Pompions</hi> upon <hi>hot Beds,</hi> to replant in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May.</hi>

                              <p>Commonly there is nothing fit to be replanted in <hi>Cold Beds</hi> at their coming out of the hot ones, till the end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> unleÅ¿s it be <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and the Earth muÅ¿t be a little warmed before we remove any thing into it out of a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> in which the Plants were Å¿till cheriÅ¿hed with Å¿ome remaining heat, or elÅ¿e they will all come to nothing there.</p>
                              <p>We make an end of pruning and planting during the courÅ¿e of this Month, of all Garden-Trees, and alÅ¿o of <hi>GooÅ¿eberry, Curran,</hi> and <hi>RaÅ¿pberry Å¿hrubs,</hi> &amp;c. It is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to delay the pruning of vigorous Trees till they begin to Å¿prout, as well to let them Å¿pend their firÅ¿t Strength, as to prevent the loÅ¿ing any of their Fruit Buds which we cannot till then diÅ¿cern, and which come to their perfection in the Spring-SeaÅ¿on.</p>
                              <p>We take up at the beginning of the Month, with Mold and all, the <hi>plantation</hi> of <hi>Strawberrys,</hi> which we had in the <hi>NurÅ¿ery,</hi> to form <hi>Cold Beds</hi> and Squares of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and to refurniÅ¿h thoÅ¿e where there want any.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow Å¿ome Å¿eed of <hi>piercepier</hi> or <hi>Garden Sampire</hi> in Å¿ome tub of Earth, or in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Ground Å¿ome Å¿heltered place; it requires commonly two Months to come up, and when it is big enough, we replant it in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and Å¿ometimes we let it grow till the next year, in order to replant it at the foot of Å¿ome Wall.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow a third time a few more <hi>Peas,</hi> for we Å¿hould be Å¿ure to Å¿ow Å¿ome of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Month of the Year, and theÅ¿e now Å¿own muÅ¿t be of the great Å¿quare Å¿ort.</p>

                              <p>At the very beginning of the Month, we Å¿ow Å¿ome little quantity of <hi>Endive</hi> very thin, to have Å¿ome of it whited about <hi>Mid-Å¿ummer.</hi>

                              <p>When we know that the Paths between <hi>hot Beds,</hi> or <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> Banks, have been Å¿tuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with very long Dung, Å¿o that there Å¿eems not to be heat enough in them, and if it be very hot weather, it is convenient to water them reaÅ¿onably well, that Å¿o the Straw in them being wetted, may the more eaÅ¿ily ferment into a heat.</p>
                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, or at the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> we Å¿ow a little <hi>Cellery</hi> in the naked <hi>Earth,</hi> to have Å¿ome late in the Months of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>September. Cellery</hi> is commonly almoÅ¿t a Month a coming up; and we Å¿ow a little of it at the Å¿ame time on a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> in order to have Å¿ome of it early.</p>
                              <p>We digg about the Roots of Fruit-Trees, that we may have finiÅ¿ht that work before they bloÅ¿Å¿om; the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> being more dangerous in Soils newly moved and turned up than in others.</p>
                              <p>We begin now to uncover a little our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> but Å¿eldom begin to manure them till the full Moon of <hi>March</hi> be paÅ¿t, which is generally very dangerous both to them and to the <hi>Figg-trees,</hi> which laÅ¿t muÅ¿t not yet be quite uncover'd, it being enough to do it half way, at the Å¿ame time we take off all their dead Wood and Branches, whether kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>FroÅ¿t,</hi> or by any other means.</p>
                              <p>About the middle of <hi>March</hi> or before, if the weather be mild, we begin to Å¿ow Å¿ome <hi>Red</hi> or <hi>Golden PurÅ¿lain</hi> upon <hi>hot beds</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> and continue Å¿till to Å¿ow of the <hi>Green</hi> Å¿ort.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48210:203"/>
We replant in their Å¿ixt places common <hi>Cabbages</hi> and <hi>Milan Cabbages,</hi> which we Å¿hould take care to have ready in our <hi>NurÅ¿ery,</hi> from the beginning of <hi>November</hi> laÅ¿t paÅ¿t, in Å¿ome well Å¿heltered place, but we replant none of thoÅ¿e that begin to mount, that is, to run up their Å¿talks, as if they were going to Seed.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow upon Å¿ome end of a <hi>cold bed</hi> in plain Earth, Å¿ome <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> Seed for a <hi>NurÅ¿ery,</hi> to furniÅ¿h us with a ProviÅ¿ion of it, which is Å¿own like other Seed.</p>
                              <p>We plant the <hi>AÅ¿paragus Squares</hi> we have occaÅ¿ion for, to which purpoÅ¿e we make choice of a fine Plantation of one years growth, or elÅ¿e of one of two.</p>
                              <p>The way to plant <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> is, to place two or three Plants of them together, and neatly to Å¿pread out their Roots without cutting them but very little, unleÅ¿s we pleaÅ¿e, and then to cover them with a layer of Earth of two or three Inches thick, to plant theÅ¿e Tufts Checquer-wiÅ¿e, at a foot and a half's diÅ¿tance one from the other.</p>
                              <p>This <hi>Cold Bed</hi> Å¿hould generally be full four Foot broad, that there may be room enough for three ranks of them. But if we deÅ¿ign to force any of them by heat in <hi>Winter,</hi> we muÅ¿t make the <hi>Cold Beds</hi> but three Foot broad, and we muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve, if the Ground be dry, to lay the Bed hollow within the Earth, with a good Spade, and by that means raiÅ¿e the Paths Arch-wiÅ¿e, making uÅ¿e of the Soil that comes out of it to cover again by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, and year by year, the Plantation as it grows Å¿tronger, and riÅ¿es out of the Ground. But if it be in a moiÅ¿t Ground, and very cool, it is better not to make the Bed Å¿o low nor hollow, but on the contrary to keep it a little higher than the paths, that the Winter waters may deÅ¿cend out of it into them, and may not rot the Plants, to which nothing is more dangerous than too much wet.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> both old and young muÅ¿t be carefully howed, or cleared of Weeds, and in this Month of <hi>March,</hi> before they begin to appear above Ground, we muÅ¿t afford them a little manuring, by turning up the Earth to the depth of half a foot about them, to give the young <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> the more Liberty to Å¿hoot up.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> that are Å¿own on hot Beds with a caÅ¿t of the Hand, are generally not Å¿o fair nor Å¿o good as thoÅ¿e Å¿owed in holes, and are more apt to grow hollow and Å¿trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy than they.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿till continue to make Å¿ome <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for <hi>RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> that we may be Å¿till Å¿upplied with them, till the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> when thoÅ¿e Å¿own in plain Ground come in. All the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Months in the Year will produce us enough of them, if we will take the pains to Å¿ow Å¿ome from time to time, and be careful liberally to water them.</p>
                              <p>At the beginning of the Month it will be time to replant what we have a mind Å¿hould run to Seed, <hi>viz. Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the <hi>white</hi> Å¿ort, <hi>Cloves</hi> of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cloves</hi> and Seeds of <hi>Shalots,</hi> white <hi>Cabbage, Pancaliers Cabbage,</hi> &amp;c. Now likewiÅ¿e we are to tie up Å¿uch <hi>Lettuces</hi> as Å¿hould <hi>Cabbage,</hi> and yet do not, which tying makes them in a manner <hi>Cabbage</hi> by force.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow the Seed of <hi>Pannacht</hi> or Å¿triped <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> before the full Moon, to replant them in <hi>May;</hi> we alÅ¿o Å¿ow the <hi>Annual Flowers</hi> upon <hi>hot Beds,</hi> to replant at the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> viz. <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿e velours,</hi> or <hi>Velvet Flowers,</hi> called alÅ¿o <hi>Flower gentles,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maranthus, Indian Ocellus</hi> or <hi>French Marygolds, Indian RoÅ¿es,</hi> the <hi>Belles de Nuit.</hi>

                              <p>We make an end of Planting Trees both in their fixed places, and in Baskets.</p>
                              <p>We beÅ¿tow the firÅ¿t manuring upon all Å¿orts of <hi>Gardens,</hi> as well to render them agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Å¿ight, during the <hi>EaÅ¿ter Holy-Days,</hi> as to diÅ¿poÅ¿e the Ground for all Å¿orts of Plants and Seeds.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿et in the Ground, <hi>Almonds</hi> that have Å¿prouted breaking off the Å¿prout before we plant them.</p>

                              <p>We furniÅ¿h thoÅ¿e places where any new planted Trees give but little marks of their proÅ¿pering, whether it be by <hi>Gum,</hi> in Å¿tone Fruit, or by pitiful Å¿mall Å¿hoots in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> But for this important Reparation, we muÅ¿t have brought up ready to our hands, Å¿ome Trees in <hi>Baskets,</hi> which an underÅ¿tanding curious PerÅ¿on will never fail to have made proviÅ¿ion of, who will have the pleaÅ¿ure to plant Å¿ome of them near thoÅ¿e that thrive not Å¿o well as they Å¿hould do, when he is not well aÅ¿Å¿ured they will abÅ¿olutely die; for when we are Å¿ure of that, we pluck them up quite, to make room for them we Å¿hould Å¿ubÅ¿titute in their place, for which purpoÅ¿e, we make choice of cloÅ¿e and rainy weather.</p>
                              <p>We perform now our Å¿econd pruning of the Branches of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> I mean only the Fruit Branches, in order to cut them off Å¿hort to that part juÅ¿t above where there is Fruit Knit; and if any of thoÅ¿e <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> have produced any very thick Å¿hoots upon high Branches, as Å¿ometimes it happens after the full Moon of <hi>March,</hi> we pinch them to make them multiply into Fruit Branches, and to keep them low, when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, that they may not run up too high before their time.</p>
                              <p>

                              <p>'Tis the <hi>Moon</hi> of this Month, that we vulgarly call the <hi>Ruddy Moon,</hi> it being very Å¿ubject to be windy, cold and dry, and to be fatal thereby to many new planted Trees, unleÅ¿s great care be taken to water them about the Foot, once a Week; For which purpoÅ¿e we make a round hollow circle or Å¿mall Trench, round about their foot juÅ¿t over the part where the Extremities of their roots are, and then pour into the Å¿aid Trench or Circle, a pitcher full of water if the Tree be little, or two or three, if it be bigger, and when the water is Å¿oak'd in, we fill up the Circle again, if we think good, with Earth, or elÅ¿e we cover it with Å¿ome dry Dung, or Weeds newly pluck'd up, that we may the better repeat our watering once a Week during the extream dry Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                              <p>We weed up all the ill weeds that grow among good Seed, we take the Å¿ame courÅ¿e with <hi>Straw-berries, Peas,</hi> and replanted <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and we howe all about them, the better to looÅ¿en the Earth, and open a paÅ¿Å¿age for the firÅ¿t rain that Å¿hall fall.</p>

At the end of the Month, we replant the <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> we have removed from the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> where we firÅ¿t raiÅ¿ed them, to make a good proviÅ¿ion of Seed, chooÅ¿ing for that purpoÅ¿e, thoÅ¿e that have the <hi>Reddest</hi> roots and the feweÅ¿t leaves, and we need only make holes at a foot diÅ¿tance one from the other, in one or more <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> with a planting Å¿tick, and thruÅ¿t in the <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> into thoÅ¿e holes, and then preÅ¿s down the Earth about them, and afterwards water them, if the rain do's not Å¿pare us that labour.</p>
                              <p>We chooÅ¿e apart of the faireÅ¿t of the <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> as well the <hi>Winter</hi> ones, which are the <hi>Shell,</hi> and <hi>JeruÅ¿alem Lettuces,</hi> as the <hi>Curles Bright Lettuce</hi> raiÅ¿ed upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> and under <hi>Bells,</hi> to plant them all together in Å¿ome <hi>Cold Beds</hi> at a foot diÅ¿tance one from another, to let them run to Seed; which we alÅ¿o perform with a planting Å¿tick.</p>
                              <p>We plant edgings of <hi>Time, Sage, Marjoram, HyÅ¿Å¿op, Lavender, Rue, Worm-wood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Spring Lettuce,</hi> to <hi>Cabbage,</hi> which Å¿ucceed one another in this order; the <hi>Curled Bright Lettuce</hi> is the firÅ¿t and beÅ¿t, as being the moÅ¿t tender and delicate, but it requires a mild and light Soil, or above all, a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> to plant it on, under <hi>Bells,</hi> from the Month of <hi>February,</hi> and during all the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> A groÅ¿s Soil agrees not with it, for inÅ¿tead of growing bigger there, it dwindles to nothing.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Green Curled Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>George Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>Little Red Lettuce,</hi> and thoÅ¿e called the <hi>Royal,</hi> the <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and the <hi>Perpignan,</hi> follow next after. The <hi>Royal Lettuce</hi> is a very fair and thick <hi>Lettuce,</hi> which differs only from the <hi>Bellegarde</hi> in that it is a little leÅ¿s <hi>Curled.</hi> The <hi>Capucin, Short, Aubervilliers,</hi> and <hi>AuÅ¿trian Lettuces</hi> Å¿ucceed them, and run not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily to Seed, as the preceeding ones. The <hi>Alfanges, Chicons,</hi> and <hi>Imperials</hi> which are all <hi>Lettuces</hi> to tie up, bring up the Rear; and the <hi>Genua Lettuces,</hi> both the <hi>Red, Bright,</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> are the laÅ¿t <hi>Summer Lettuces;</hi> we muÅ¿t replant a good number of them at the very beginning of <hi>May,</hi> to have them good about <hi>Mid-Å¿ummer,</hi> and all the reÅ¿t of the <hi>Summer;</hi> of all <hi>Lettuces,</hi> this Å¿ort beÅ¿t endures the great heats, and is leaÅ¿t diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to run to Seed; for which reaÅ¿on to obtain Seed of it, we muÅ¿t have Å¿own it upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> from the very Month of <hi>February,</hi> that we may have Å¿ome good plants of it to Å¿et again at the latter end of <hi>April.</hi>

                              <p>The <hi>Royal Lettuce</hi> begins again to be fit to be replanted about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> to Å¿upply us, together with that of <hi>Genua,</hi> all the reÅ¿t of Autumn.

                              <p>It is hard to make any DeÅ¿criptions of theÅ¿e Å¿orts of <hi>Lettuces,</hi> exact enough to diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿h them by, the difference between them conÅ¿iÅ¿ting chiefly in having Leaves a little more or leÅ¿s green, or <hi>Curled;</hi> It is enough for the curious to know their names, to be enabled to ask for them of their Friends, or buy them of the Herb Merchants, we learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually to know them in the uÅ¿ing. The two <hi>CriÅ¿ped</hi> or <hi>Curled Sorts</hi> are Å¿o called, from the <hi>Curling</hi> of their Leaves, and the <hi>Red</hi> ones from their Colour. The <hi>Shell Lettuce</hi> has a very round Leaf which is very apt to Å¿hut up like a <hi>Shell.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>There is an infinite DiverÅ¿ity of kinds of <hi>Lettuces,</hi> the worÅ¿t is that which we call <hi>Cats Tongue,</hi> which is very Å¿harp pointed, and never <hi>Cabbages.</hi> The <hi>Aubervilliers Lettuce</hi> grows Å¿o very hard that it is Å¿carce fit for <hi>Sallets,</hi> but is better for pottage; but yet it is very Å¿ubject to be bitter.</p>
                              <p>We muÅ¿t not fail every fifteen days, to Å¿ow a little <hi>Genua Lettuce,</hi> that we may always be provided with Å¿ome fit to replant during all the whole <hi>Summer,</hi> till the middle of <hi>September;</hi> we muÅ¿t be careful and eÅ¿pecially in rainy weather, to deÅ¿troy both the Black and <hi>Shell Snails</hi> that come out of the Walls where they breed Young ones, becauÅ¿e they do a great deal of miÅ¿chief by gnawing the young Shoots of Trees, and new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lettuces</hi> and <hi>Cabbages.</hi> If the <hi>Ruddy</hi> or <hi>Dry Winds</hi> Reign, as they generally do this Month, we muÅ¿t carefully and plentifully water every thing in our <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> except it be the <hi>AÅ¿paragus.</hi>

                                 <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48210:205"/>
We alÅ¿o now diÅ¿-eye or Å¿eparate the Off-Sets or Slips of our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> as Å¿oon as they are big enough, and we plant as many of them as we need, two or three of them in each hole, or Trench of about three or four Inches deep, and two full Foot and a half diÅ¿tance one from the other, each <hi>Bed</hi> Å¿hould be four foot wide, and contain two rows of <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants along its Å¿ides, and there muÅ¿t be a void Å¿pace left in the middle, of three foot wide for the planting of <hi>Leek Chaids,</hi> or great whited <hi>Leeks,</hi> or elÅ¿e of <hi>Collyflowers,</hi> in imitation of the Market-Gard'ners, who are good Husbands of their Ground. The two <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants which we Å¿et in each hole, muÅ¿t be placed a full foot and half diÅ¿tance one from the other.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿till continue planting <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> and filling the places where there are any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if we can timely diÅ¿cover them, and we take care to water the new Plants.</p>
                              <p>We likewiÅ¿e Å¿till bind up thoÅ¿e <hi>Lettuces</hi> that Cabbage not as they Å¿hould.</p>
                              <p>We keep open the Windows of the green HouÅ¿es, where our <hi>Orange Trees</hi> are in fair weather, to reaccuÅ¿tom them by little and little, to the wide Air; towards the end of the Month, we bring out our <hi>JaÅ¿min</hi> and trim it; we alÅ¿o begin to prune our Vines at the firÅ¿t coming in of the Month, if we have neglected to do it about the middle of <hi>March</hi> laÅ¿t; and we prune the <hi>Wall Vines</hi> Å¿ooner than thoÅ¿e in the open Fields.</p>
                              <p>We have already in the month of <hi>March,</hi> Å¿et into the Earth, thoÅ¿e <hi>Almonds</hi> which Å¿prouted early, and in this Month we Å¿et thoÅ¿e which having not Å¿prouted at the Å¿ame time with the others, had been put up back again into Mold, Earth, or Sand.</p>
                              <p>In the beginning of this Month, Gardens Å¿hould be almoÅ¿t in their Perfection, as well for their general neatneÅ¿s, and pleaÅ¿ing ProÅ¿pect, as being all over covered either with the green Seedlings of all Å¿orts which have been Å¿own, or with Plants which have been Å¿et, excepting <hi>Endive, Succory, Celery, Collyflowers,</hi> &amp;c. which are not replanted till about the middle of <hi>May.</hi> In fine, if we have neglected any thing that Å¿hould have been done in <hi>March,</hi> we muÅ¿t be Å¿ure to do it at the very beginning of this Month, and particularly, we muÅ¿t Å¿ow <hi>ParÅ¿ly, wild Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> and the firÅ¿t <hi>Harico's</hi> or <hi>French-Beans,</hi> the Å¿econd being to be Å¿own about the middle, and the third at the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> that Å¿o we may have a crop of them about two Months after Å¿owing.</p>
                              <p>About this time, the <hi>Strawberries</hi> growing in the naked Earth, Å¿hoot forth their Å¿tems, when we muÅ¿t take exact care to pluck all the <hi>Cuckows</hi> among them, that is, thoÅ¿e <hi>Straw-berry</hi> plants that bloÅ¿Å¿om much without knitting; nay, I would have the <hi>Caprons</hi> pluckt up too, unleÅ¿s any PerÅ¿on have a particular fancy for them, they are eaÅ¿ie to be known by their thick Å¿hort and Velvet Å¿tems, their large Flowers, and their very long Velvet, and Å¿harp pointed Leaves; but the <hi>Cuckows</hi> are Å¿omewhat hard to be diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿ht, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly till their Å¿tems be formed. The moÅ¿t part of them are <hi>Strawberry</hi> Plants that have degenerated, and yet Å¿o, that the Leaves of the good ones and the bad ones are pretty like one another; but thoÅ¿e degenerate Plants in proceÅ¿s of time by their runners, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an infinite number of others, which to appearance are very fair, and conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very apt to deceive us, yet thoÅ¿e that are acquainted with them, obÅ¿erve that they are a little more Velveted, and Å¿omewhat greener than the good ones. And in Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, I muÅ¿t tell you, that if extraordinary care be not taken to extirpate thoÅ¿e unlucky Plants that impoÅ¿e upon us thus by their Beauty, we Å¿hall in little time find our<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Å¿elves Å¿tockt with none but Å¿uch, to which the Proverb particularly agrees, which Å¿aith, <hi>a fair Å¿how, but little Fruit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow our laÅ¿t <hi>Cucumbers</hi> about the tenth or twelfth of this Month, to have Å¿ome lateward ones, and Å¿uch as may be fit to pickle in <hi>October,</hi> which laÅ¿t are commonly called <hi>Cornichons,</hi> or horned <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and in <hi>EngliÅ¿h, Crumplings,</hi> and <hi>Guerkins.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Strawberry</hi> Å¿tems muÅ¿t be much pinched, and Å¿ome of them muÅ¿t be quite plucked up too when they Å¿hoot up in too great Numbers from feeble Plants; by pinching, here is meant the taking off the laÅ¿t Flowers and laÅ¿t Buds of every Å¿tem, leaving but three or four of thoÅ¿e that firÅ¿t appeared upon thoÅ¿e Å¿tems, and which are neareÅ¿t to the Ground.</p>
                              <p>It is particularly about the end of this Month, that <hi>May</hi> Moon begins, that is Å¿o fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and Å¿o vigorous in its Productions, when we muÅ¿t with all poÅ¿Å¿ible care run over our <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> and draw from behind the Trails, thoÅ¿e Branches that grow between them and the Wall, as well the Å¿maller ones, as more particularly thoÅ¿e that are thick: at the Å¿ame time <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> and other <hi>Stone-Fruit-Trees</hi> are to be pruned the third time, it having been done the Å¿econd time whilÅ¿t they were in BloÅ¿Å¿om, to take away all thoÅ¿e Branches that had not bloÅ¿Å¿om'd. And at this time we reckon, that all thoÅ¿e BloÅ¿Å¿oms that will knit at all, are already knit, and accordingly we are not to count any of them for true <hi>Peaches,</hi> but thoÅ¿e only that are well knit, and of a pretty bigneÅ¿s too, becauÅ¿e
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48210:205"/>
till then, many of them continue to fall, though they Å¿eemed well knit. And therefore it is convenient to Å¿horten all thoÅ¿e Branches which having been left long purpoÅ¿ely for Fruit, have not anÅ¿wered that end, but have either retained no Fruit at all, or a very Å¿mall quantity, and which perhaps Å¿prout but weakly, that is, produce but very little Å¿hoots, or perhaps nothing but Leaves, the feebleÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Branches muÅ¿t be diÅ¿char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of all their Å¿hoots, to one or two at moÅ¿t, and in general, all thoÅ¿e Branches muÅ¿t be Å¿hortned, that appear not vigorouÅ¿ly, or that are blaÅ¿ted by the <hi>Ruddy Winds.</hi> And LaÅ¿tly, we muÅ¿t leave only Å¿uch a burden of Branches and Fruit on the Tree as Å¿hall be proportionable to its greater or leÅ¿Å¿er Vigour, and accordingly we muÅ¿t leave a great deal upon vigorous Trees, eÅ¿pecially if they be Å¿prung from Stones, and but a little on them that are weak, and always aim as near as may be, to form that which we call a goodly Tree, taking all poÅ¿Å¿ible care that each Fruit-Branch may have its Fruit at its Extremity. This third pruning Å¿hould be done either before we new nail up our Wall-Trees, or at leaÅ¿t whilÅ¿t we are nailing them.</p>
                              <p>At this time likewiÅ¿e, we are to pinch, that is to Å¿ay, break off, to four or five Eyes or Buds, thoÅ¿e thick Å¿hoots in Peach-Trees that are Å¿prung out Å¿ince the main Pruning of that year, in order to make them Å¿hoot out three or four midling Å¿hoots, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be for a Wood Branch, and the reÅ¿t for Fruit; this Operation is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med particularly upon thoÅ¿e very thick Å¿hoots that Å¿pring out of the Extremity of a Tree that is grown high, when it has already attained its due height. It is likewiÅ¿e Å¿ometimes, though rarely performed upon the lower Å¿hoots, when we have occaÅ¿ion to fill up any void places that are made near any very thick Branches, whether young or old, which we have cut Å¿hort the laÅ¿t Winters Pruning; thoÅ¿e thick Branches are but too Å¿ubject ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to Å¿prout at all, or to grow full of Gum, both they and the young Shoots they produce in the <hi>Spring</hi> time.</p>
                              <p>It is not convenient to pinch any of all the other Fruit-Trees, excepting <hi>Graffs,</hi> when having been graffed upon thick Å¿tocks, they have begun to Å¿hoot out with too much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, becauÅ¿e the Å¿hoots of Å¿uch graffs would grow too high, and too bare, if they were not checkt by this Operation, and made to produce many Branches that prove good, inÅ¿tead of one that otherwiÅ¿e might have remained uÅ¿eleÅ¿s, unleÅ¿s it be in Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions we may pinch as long as we pleaÅ¿e, we Å¿hall never gain any advantage by it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pinching extends likewiÅ¿e to <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> but that is not to be done till the end of <hi>May,</hi> as I Å¿hall further Å¿hew afterwards.</p>

                              <p>THe Effects of <hi>Vegetation</hi> during the Month of <hi>March,</hi> Å¿eemed to be but little proofs of Trial which Nature then made in order to Å¿ome greater performances. For alaÅ¿s, Trees bloÅ¿Å¿oming or Å¿hooting forth Leaves, or beginning to put forth Å¿welling Buds. &amp;c. are all marks of leÅ¿Å¿er vigour than weakneÅ¿s, after which, in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>April,</hi> we have Å¿een the Å¿ame <hi>Nature</hi> augment in Å¿trength, and Å¿hew its effects by the knitting of Fruit, lengthning out Branches, and the coming up of Å¿own Seeds, &amp;c. But at length when we once come to the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 'tis then that <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Å¿eems in earneÅ¿t to diÅ¿play and exert all the force Å¿he is MiÅ¿treÅ¿s of, in order to the maintaining her Å¿elf in that flouriÅ¿hing EÅ¿tate during the whole Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> following, at this time covering the Walls with new Branches, plumping the Fruit, and covering the Earth with a lovely and charming verdure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ners have great need to be upon their Guards, to prevent their Gardens falling into diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, becauÅ¿e 'tis moÅ¿t Å¿ure, that if they be not now extreamly careful and laborious, there is no DiÅ¿aÅ¿ter, but they may expect; pernicious Weeds will in little time choke up all their good Seeds, their Walks and Alleys will be overgrown, and their Trees will fall into the greateÅ¿t ConfuÅ¿ion, for which reaÅ¿ons it will highly concern them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly watchful and diligent to weed, manure, cleanÅ¿e, to take off all Å¿uperfluous Leaves and Sprigs, and to nail up <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> by which means it will be in their Power to acquire the deÅ¿irable Commendation of having adorned and Å¿et out their Gardens with all the luÅ¿tre and excellency which they ought to have.</p>

                                 <hi>Green Peas,</hi> that were Å¿own in Banks or Borders in <hi>October,</hi> now begin to recompenÅ¿e our Pains, and to bloÅ¿Å¿om at the coming in of this Month, (the BloÅ¿Å¿oms laÅ¿t commonly about eight or ten days before they begin to pod, and in three weeks after, they are fit to gather, and Å¿hell. In the mean while, about the Å¿eventh or eighth day of the Month, we Å¿hould plant our <hi>Collyflowers, Milan Cabbages, Capucin Capers,</hi> or <hi>NaÅ¿turces, Beet-Chards,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48210:206"/>
If we plant them Å¿ooner, they commonly run to Seed, which is to be avoided; and in fine for thoÅ¿e things, we ought not to paÅ¿s the fifteenth day, nor likewiÅ¿e for the Å¿owing of <hi>Winter Cabbages.</hi> We now make all the haÅ¿t we can, to make an end of diÅ¿-eying or Å¿lipping our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> which are vigorous, and Å¿eem to have need of being diÅ¿charged and thinned, and we make an end of planting new ones. The Eyes or Sucker-Å¿lips are good enough, provided they be pretty thick and white, though they have no root at their heel or foot, and we may be Å¿ure to have very fine Fruit from them in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and in truth it were to be wiÅ¿hed, they would yield none Å¿ooner, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e produced before that time are commonly pitiful, Å¿tarveling, and as 'twere abortive Fruits. Yet 'tis not enough to plant only Å¿ome good thick young Å¿lip-Å¿uckers, but we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e plant Å¿ome midling ones, eÅ¿pecially in Å¿ome well Å¿heltred place, only to fortifie themÅ¿elves there during the reÅ¿t of the year, that they may be able to yield us their firÅ¿t <hi>Artichokes</hi> next <hi>Spring;</hi> thoÅ¿e which have born in <hi>Autumn,</hi> not making Å¿uch Å¿wift advances as theÅ¿e other. Next we are to plant our <hi>Beet Chards</hi> almoÅ¿t at the Å¿ame time, which are well placed, if planted in the middle of the <hi>Artichokes,</hi> that is, one <hi>Beet</hi> plant between two <hi>Artichokes,</hi> Å¿o that there may be Å¿ome in one Rank, and none in the other, for there muÅ¿t be room enough left free, to go upon to water, weed, manure, gather, and to cover them too, when need Å¿hall require.</p>
                              <p>The EarlieÅ¿t <hi>Musk Melons</hi> begin to knit in the firÅ¿t quarter, or at the full of this Months <hi>Moon,</hi> but chiefly at the wane of it, if their <hi>Beds</hi> were very hot at the full, and are grown cooler at the wane.</p>
                              <p>We alÅ¿o at the Å¿ame time Rank our <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in the place alloted for the <hi>Fig Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that we may have them in the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition we deÅ¿ire. They begin then to put forth their Leaves and Å¿hoots, and at length their Fruit begins to plump at the full <hi>Moon.</hi>

                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, we begin with diligence and expedition, to nail up the new Å¿hoots of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> if they be Å¿trong enough to Å¿uffer it: And it is convenient to have finiÅ¿h'd this Work at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> becauÅ¿e at the end of that Month, we muÅ¿t begin the Å¿econd nailing of the firÅ¿t Å¿hoots, and the firÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e which were never yet nail'd. We muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e pinch, or break off the thick Å¿hoots we find, whether becauÅ¿e after the firÅ¿t pinching of <hi>April,</hi> they have not multiplied into Branches as far as they extend, and on the contrary, have produced yet but one thick Å¿hoot, or becauÅ¿e, though they have multiplied into Branches, they have produced one Å¿hoot thick enough to be pinched; for otherwiÅ¿e that thick Å¿hoot would be unuÅ¿eful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious; unuÅ¿eful, becauÅ¿e it muÅ¿t be taken away, or at leaÅ¿t be cut very Å¿hort, and pernicious, becauÅ¿e it will, as one may Å¿ay, have robb'd other neceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿hoots of that nouriÅ¿hment they Å¿hould have had: Always taking it for a Rule, that we muÅ¿t in nailing, take care to couch all thoÅ¿e Branches which may and ought to be couched, without tying Å¿everal of them together, or taking away, or plucking off any that is Å¿ightly, unleÅ¿s it be that we can by no means couch it, in which caÅ¿e, we muÅ¿t cut it off within the breadth of a Crown piece of the place from whence it Å¿prouts, in hopes that out of the two Å¿ides of the remaining Å¿tump of that thickneÅ¿s, there may Å¿prout Å¿ome good Fruit-Branches, we muÅ¿t alÅ¿o have a care not to lay one croÅ¿s another, unleÅ¿s we be neceÅ¿Å¿arily obliged Å¿o to do, to fill up a void place, or to preÅ¿erve a uniform equality.</p>
                              <p>If there be any Trees deÅ¿igned to mount upright, we muÅ¿t accordingly order for that purpoÅ¿e, the Branch that Å¿eems moÅ¿t proper for it.</p>
                              <p>We tie the graffs either to their Trunk, or to Å¿ticks Å¿et up on purpoÅ¿e by them, to make them grow in that figure we would have them, and hinder them from being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Winds.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow a great deal of <hi>Genua Lettuce,</hi> and we replant Å¿ome of them, and of the other <hi>Lettuces</hi> alÅ¿o.</p>
                              <p>We likewiÅ¿e trim <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> either to take off the falÅ¿e Å¿hoots if any appear, which is done by plucking them quite away when they make a confuÅ¿ion, or even Å¿uch others which though they be good, yet becauÅ¿e they might produce that confuÅ¿ion which is Å¿o much to be avoided in a Tree, muÅ¿t therefore be taken off, for the better fortifying of thoÅ¿e that are to make the figure of that Tree; for a Å¿econd Å¿hoot will grow much more vigorous, if we take away that which being at the extremity of the pruned Branch was counted for the firÅ¿t.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow <hi>Endive,</hi> that we may have Å¿ome good, at the end of <hi>July,</hi> which may be white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Å¿ame place where it firÅ¿t grew, without removing, if it being Å¿own thin, and well watered during the whole Month.

weather, to replant in their deÅ¿igned places, our annual Flowers, Å¿ome of them Å¿eldom failing to come to good there; we likewiÅ¿e take the advantage of the Å¿ame time, to fill up with <hi>Basketed,</hi> or <hi>CircumpoÅ¿ed</hi> Trees, the places of thoÅ¿e that are dead, or that thwart our expectations, or that give us no very good hopes of their thriving. The manner of doing it, is, to make a hole big enough to hold the Basket and Tree, then to put it in, and carefully to fill up with Earth all the hollow Å¿pace round about the Basket, and to preÅ¿s it down hard either with the foot or hand, and then to pour down all round upon it, two or three pitchers full of water, in order to the better incorporating the Earth without, with that within, Å¿o that there may not be left the leaÅ¿t hollow in the world. It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to renew theÅ¿e waterings two or three times during the reÅ¿t of the <hi>Summer.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We alÅ¿o Å¿till plant <hi>Beet Chards,</hi> chooÅ¿ing for that purpoÅ¿e the brighteÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e that are of the growth of the laÅ¿t Å¿own Seeds, as being both fairer and better than thoÅ¿e which are green.</p>
                              <p>We continue our <hi>NurÅ¿eries</hi> of <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants till the end of this Month, at which time, we may perfectly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the good ones by their Stems, or upright Å¿hoots.</p>
                              <p>We alÅ¿o Å¿till continue to tie up thoÅ¿e <hi>Lettuces</hi> that <hi>Cabbage</hi> not as they Å¿hould.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿ow no more <hi>Lettuces,</hi> except <hi>Genuz Lettuces,</hi> after the middle of <hi>May,</hi> becauÅ¿e all the reÅ¿t but only this laÅ¿t Å¿ort, are too apt to run to Seed.</p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Musk Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers</hi> in the naked Earth in little Holes or Trenches filled with mold; we alÅ¿o plant <hi>Pumpions<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                                 </hi> or <hi>Citruls</hi> in the like holes, at the diÅ¿tance of three <hi>ToiÅ¿es</hi> or <hi>Fathoms,</hi> they are Å¿uch as have been raiÅ¿ed on <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and therefore to make them take root again, the Å¿ooner, we cover them with Å¿omething for five or Å¿ix days, unleÅ¿s it rain, the great heat of the Sun, otherwiÅ¿e being apt to make them wither, and Å¿ometimes to kill them quite.</p>
                              <p>We continue to Å¿ow a few <hi>Peas,</hi> which muÅ¿t be of the biggeÅ¿t Å¿ort; and if we think good, we pull off Å¿ome of the Branches of the others that are over vigorous, after they are well cleared of Weeds; <hi>Peas</hi> that are disbranched, bearing a more plentiful crop than others.</p>
                              <p>We bring out our <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> at the firÅ¿t quarter of this Months <hi>Moon,</hi> if the weather begin to be Å¿ecure from the aÅ¿Å¿aults of the <hi>FroÅ¿t,</hi> and we put them into boxes that have need of it; I referr you for their culture to the TreatiÅ¿e I have compoÅ¿ed expreÅ¿ly about that Å¿ubject: It was our care during all the fair days in <hi>April,</hi> to leave open the windows of their <hi>ConÅ¿ervatories,</hi> to accuÅ¿tom them by degrees, to the open Air.</p>
                              <p>We trim our <hi>JaÅ¿mins</hi> when we bring them out, cutting off all their Branches to the length of half an Inch.</p>
                              <p>At the end of this Month, we begin to clip for the firÅ¿t time, our paliÅ¿ades, or pole hedges of <hi>Box, Filaria's, Yew</hi> and <hi>EÅ¿picia's.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Above all things, care muÅ¿t be taken to water all our plants largely, or elÅ¿e they will all roaÅ¿t and Å¿corch, whereas by the help of Å¿eaÅ¿onable waterings, we may viÅ¿ibly perceive them thrive. We alÅ¿o now water new planted Trees, and for that purpoÅ¿e, we make a hollow Circle of four or five Inches deep, round about the extreamities of the roots, and pour into it Å¿ome pitchers of water, and when 'tis Å¿oak'd in, we either throw back the Earth into the Circle, or elÅ¿e we cover it with dry Dung, or little, in order to renew our waterings Å¿everal other times, till the Trees have taken faÅ¿t root again, after which, we fill it up with Earth again.</p>
                              <p>We may begin to replant our <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> for Seeding towards the end of the Month.</p>
                              <p>We continue to trim <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> but we replant no more of them after the middle of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But we Å¿till continue to plant <hi>Cucumbers.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>About the end of the Month; we begin to plant <hi>Cellery,</hi> and we uÅ¿e two ways of planting it, <hi>viz.</hi> either in <hi>Cold Beds</hi> hollowed into the Ground, as we do <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting three ranks of them in every <hi>Bed,</hi> and placing both the ranks, and the <hi>Cellery</hi> plants at about a foot diÅ¿tance one from another, and that is the beÅ¿t way for them when they are a little bigger than ordinary, that Å¿o we may be able to raiÅ¿e the earth about them afterwards, with that which was taken out of the furrows, and which was thrown upon the next <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> or elÅ¿e we replant them on plain Ground at the Å¿ame diÅ¿tance as before, and at the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> binding them firÅ¿t with two or three bands; theÅ¿e are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in tufts, that we may replant them as nigh as we can, to one another, that Å¿o they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48210:207"/>
may be the more eaÅ¿ily covered with long dry Dung, and be the better whitened, and defended from the <hi>FroÅ¿t.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, we begin to tie our <hi>Vines</hi> to their props, and to nail up Å¿uch Å¿tocks of them as are planted by <hi>Walls,</hi> after we have firÅ¿t clear'd them of all their feeble, unprofitable, and unfruitful Shoots and Sprigs.</p>
                              <p>We likewiÅ¿e plant Å¿ingle <hi>Anemonies,</hi> which flower a Month after, and we may have planted Å¿ome every Month Å¿ince the laÅ¿t preceeding <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> they blowing and flowering in the Å¿ame manner, if not hindered by an extream cold SeaÅ¿on.</p>
                              <p>At the very beginning of the Month, or at leaÅ¿t as Å¿oon as ever we can, we pick off, and thin our <hi>Apricocks</hi> when there are too many of them, never leaving two cloÅ¿e to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that Å¿o thoÅ¿e we leave on, may grow the bigger, and at the end of the Å¿ame Month, we may pick off, and thin our <hi>Teaches</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> if they be big enough, and there be two many of them. About that time alÅ¿o, or at the beginning of the enÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Month, the firÅ¿t bright <hi>Cabbages</hi> are to be Å¿own for <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> the biggeÅ¿t of them which are replanted in <hi>July,</hi> being to be eaten in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and the leÅ¿s vigorous which are replanted in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> being to Å¿erve for our Winter Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion.</p>
                              <p>During all the Month of <hi>May,</hi> the Å¿hoots of <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> are apt enough to Å¿lide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves behind their trails or props as I have Å¿aid in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> and we Å¿hall hardly be able to draw them out again without breaking them, unleÅ¿s we do it in time, and be careful once every Week, to take an exact view all along our Walls, to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Å¿o miÅ¿chievous an inconvenience, againÅ¿t which too much caution cannot be uÅ¿ed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branches grow crooked, rugged, parched, and hooked at the ends, and their Leaves alÅ¿o; and therefore about the full Moon, we muÅ¿t pull off thoÅ¿e Leaves Å¿o crumpled and hooked, and break off as low as we can, the parched Å¿hoots, that there may Å¿pring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inÅ¿tead of them that may be better and Å¿treighter. <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> too muÅ¿t now be pruned, and eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e in Boxes, of the method of doing which, I have compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed a particular TreatiÅ¿e.</p>
                              <p>We continue to Å¿ow a few <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> among other Seeds, as we Å¿hould have alÅ¿o done in the two laÅ¿t preceeding Months.</p>
                              <p>We alÅ¿o now take the advantage of Å¿ome gentle Showers, or of very cloudy weather, to uncover what we have Å¿heltred under <hi>GlaÅ¿s Bells</hi> or <hi>Frames,</hi> as well for the watering of our <hi>Beds,</hi> as for the inuring and hardening them to indure the open Air.</p>
                              <p>If our Garden be Å¿ituated in a Sandy and dry Ground, we endeavour by the help of Å¿ome little Dykes or Gutters, to carry off all the water that falls Å¿ometimes in haÅ¿tly Storms, to thoÅ¿e places that are manured, that none of it may be unprofitably waÅ¿ted in the Walks or Allies, and if they be Å¿ituated in Ground that is too Å¿trong, fat and moiÅ¿t, Å¿uch as that of our new Kitchen-Garden at <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> we drain it away from thoÅ¿e Grounds that are incommoded by it, by conveying it into the Walls or Allies, to Å¿pend it Å¿elf there, or Å¿hooting it off into Stone gutters that carry it out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; for which purpoÅ¿e we muÅ¿t raiÅ¿e our Ground into arch'd ridges.</p>
                              <p>During all this Month, it is good to lay yellow Å¿tock <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> by planting cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of them, where ever we have a mind, or by laying their Branches that Å¿till grow to their Plants.</p>
                              <p>ThoÅ¿e that are curious in <hi>Carnations</hi> and <hi>Clove-Gilliflowers,</hi> in order to have double ones, Å¿ow Å¿ome good Seeds of them about the 5, 6, 7, or 8th. of <hi>May</hi> Moon, in earthen Pans, or wooden Tubs, that at leaÅ¿t they may begin to Å¿prout at the full Moon, which Å¿ometimes happens in <hi>June,</hi> but moÅ¿t commonly in <hi>May,</hi> thoÅ¿e plants ought to grow big enough to be removed in <hi>September,</hi> into the naked Earth, that Å¿o they may have taken Ground before the <hi>Equinox;</hi> others again content themÅ¿elves with Å¿owing their Seeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Equinox.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e replant before the end of <hi>May,</hi> Å¿ome <hi>green curled,</hi> and <hi>Aubervilliers Lettuce,</hi> that we may have Å¿ome all the Month of <hi>June,</hi> together with the <hi>Chicons,</hi> and <hi>Imperial Long-Lettuce.</hi>

                              <p>We muÅ¿t alÅ¿o at this time endeavour to deÅ¿troy the thick white Worms, which now Å¿poil the <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage Lettuce,</hi> and take away the green <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> which quite cat up the Leaves of the <hi>Curran</hi> and <hi>GooÅ¿eberry buÅ¿hes,</hi> and Å¿o Å¿poil their Fruit.</p>
                              <p>At the end of <hi>May,</hi> we Å¿hould alÅ¿o thin thoÅ¿e Roots that grow too thick, and replant thoÅ¿e we have plucked up in another place, as <hi>Beet-raves,</hi> or <hi>Red Beet-Roots, ParÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                              <p>IHere repeat the Å¿ame Caution I have already given at the beginning of the Works of each Month, which is, that we muÅ¿t be careful to do that at the beginning of this Month, which we could not do in the laÅ¿t, and we muÅ¿t moreover continue all the Å¿ame Works, excepting hot Beds for <hi>Musk-melons,</hi> which now have no longer need of them, but we may Å¿till make Å¿ome for the latter <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and for <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We may alÅ¿o plant Å¿ome <hi>Artichokes,</hi> till the twelfth or fifteenth of the Month, which being well watered, will Å¿erve for the next <hi>Spring.</hi> Waterings are to no purpoÅ¿e, if they Å¿oak not to the Root, and therefore the deeper the Plant is rooted, the more plentifully muÅ¿t it be watered, and eÅ¿pecially in dry Ground, for in wet Grounds, they muÅ¿t be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered both leÅ¿s often, and leÅ¿s plentifully. For example, <hi>Artichokes</hi> growing in light Grounds, have need of a Pitcher full or two of Water, for each Plant, whereas in Å¿tronger Grounds, one pitcher full will Å¿erve three.</p>
                              <p>Towards the middle of <hi>June,</hi> we plant <hi>Leeks</hi> in Holes or Trenches Å¿ix full Inches deep, at half a foot's diÅ¿tance one from the other, which is done with a planting Å¿tick, placing but one of them in each hole, without heeding to preÅ¿s down the Earth cloÅ¿e about the <hi>Leek,</hi> when we have done, as is practiÅ¿ed to all other Plants that are Å¿et with a planting Å¿tick.</p>
                              <p>We continue to Å¿ow <hi>Endive,</hi> and <hi>Genua Lettuce,</hi> that we may be furniÅ¿ht with Å¿ome to replant upon occaÅ¿ion, all the reÅ¿t of the Summer, and we gather the <hi>Chervil</hi> that is the firÅ¿t that runs up to Seed from the <hi>Chervil,</hi> that was Å¿own the <hi>Autumn</hi> before, cutting off all the Seed Å¿tems, and when they are dried, threÅ¿hing out the Seed, and fanning it like Wheat.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿ame method is practiÅ¿ed with all Seeds that are gathered each in their proper SeaÅ¿ons, and eÅ¿pecially in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> taking great care to prevent the Birds, who are very greedy of them, from devouring them.</p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Beet Chards</hi> in order to have them good to eat in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and they are beÅ¿t placed in the void Å¿pace remaining between the <hi>Artichoke Ranks,</hi> they muÅ¿t be Å¿et at the diÅ¿tance of a Foot and a half one from the other.</p>
                              <p>We muÅ¿t take great care to extirpate all the Weeds which now grow up in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and that particularly before they run to Seed, to prevent their multiplying which they are apt to do but too much of themÅ¿elves without Å¿owing.</p>
                              <p>We muÅ¿t now alÅ¿o without further delay, clip all our PaliÅ¿ade's, and edgings of Box, Å¿o that they may be all furniÅ¿ht at furtheÅ¿t at <hi>Mid-Summer,</hi> and have time to Å¿hoot out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before <hi>Autumn;</hi> and we muÅ¿t liberally water all Seeds Å¿own in our <hi>Kitchen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We muÅ¿t water plentifully, and every day the <hi>Cucumbers</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and <hi>Musk-melons</hi> moderately two or three times a Week, allowing half a pitcher full of Water to each Plant.</p>
                              <p>From the very middle of <hi>June</hi> we begin to graff by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> our <hi>Stone-Fruit-Trees,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially <hi>Cherries</hi> upon great Trees, upon Wood of two years growth, which are cut off three or four inches from the place where the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> is to be placed. The beÅ¿t time for this, is always before the <hi>SolÅ¿tice.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>GroÅ¿s Soils muÅ¿t be often Å¿tirred and manured, that they may not have time to grow hard, and chap, commonly we beÅ¿tow an univerÅ¿al manuring or Å¿tirring up the Ground upon all our Gardens in this SeaÅ¿on, and the beÅ¿t time to Å¿tir dry Grounds in, is either a little before or after Rain, or even whilÅ¿t it rains, that the water may the more Å¿wiftly penetrate to the bottom, before the great heat comes to turn it into Vapors, and for Å¿trong and moiÅ¿t Soils, we muÅ¿t wait for hot and dry weather, to dry and heat them, before we move them, carefull Gard'ners make Dykes to convey the gluts of Water that fall about this time in haÅ¿ty Storms, a croÅ¿s their Squares, eÅ¿pecially if their Ground be light; but on the contrary, if it be too Å¿trong, they drain the water out of the Squares, as I have Å¿aid already, when I was Å¿peaking of the works of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>PerÅ¿ons curious in Carnations, and Clove-gilliflowers, Å¿hould have begun before this time to put Rings about each plant of them, to keep up their mounting Å¿tems, and hinder the Winds from breaking off their Buds or Buttons, the like they do to their <hi>Sedums,</hi> &amp;c. and if they have not yet done it, they do it in this Month, and not only take off
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48210:208"/>
from them the Å¿mall Buds that grow upon them in over great Numbers, to fortifie the principal ones, but likewiÅ¿e the greateÅ¿t part of the mounting Å¿tems, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve only one of the faireÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t likely, to produce the moÅ¿t beautiful Flowers.</p>
                              <p>We alÅ¿o Å¿till continue to deÅ¿troy the thick white Worms that Å¿poil the <hi>Strawberries</hi> and <hi>Cabbage Lettuce.</hi>

                              <p>We carefully cultivate our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> according to the method preÅ¿cribed in the TreatiÅ¿e I have compoÅ¿ed purpoÅ¿ely on that Subject.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Wild PurÅ¿lain</hi> begins to appear at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> and laÅ¿ts till the end of <hi>July,</hi> which muÅ¿t be carefully Å¿craped.</p>
                              <p>We take up our <hi>Tulip</hi> Roots out of the Ground at the end of this Month, their Leaves being then withered.</p>
                              <p>We disbranch <hi>Harico's</hi> or <hi>French-Beans,</hi> and towards the end of this Month, we Å¿ow <hi>Peas</hi> to have them fit to eat in <hi>September.</hi>

We replant a great deal of <hi>Endive</hi> at a large foot diÅ¿tance between Plant and Plant, as alÅ¿o <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Perpignan Lettuces,</hi> which are very good in <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter.</hi>

                              <p>We Å¿till continue to replant Winter Cabbages.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿hear our <hi>PaliÅ¿ade's</hi> the Å¿econd time.</p>
                              <p>We continue to nail up our Wall-Trees, and by little and little, to uncover thoÅ¿e Fruits, which we would have tinged with much Red, as <hi>Peaches, Api Apples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>We tye up our <hi>Endive</hi> with one, two, or with three bands, if it be very high, but the uppermoÅ¿t Band muÅ¿t be always looÅ¿er than the reÅ¿t, otherwiÅ¿e the <hi>Lettuce</hi> will burÅ¿t in the Å¿ides whilÅ¿t it is whitening.</p>
                              <p>At the middle of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> we begin to cover with compoÅ¿t, the <hi>Sorrel</hi> that was cut very cloÅ¿e to recruit its vigour, a good Inch's thickneÅ¿s of CompoÅ¿t is enough to Å¿trew all over it, becauÅ¿e they would be apt to rot, if we Å¿hould uÅ¿e more to them.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿till continue Å¿owing of <hi>Sorrel, Chervil,</hi> and <hi>Ciboules.</hi>

                              <p>We pluck off the runners of <hi>Strawberry</hi> Plants, to preÅ¿erve their old Stocks in the greater vigour, and when their Fruit is paÅ¿t, which is about the end of <hi>July,</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> we cut away all the old Å¿tems, and old Leaves, that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new ones.</p>
                              <p>We alÅ¿o cut away all the old Stems of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> when the <hi>Artichokes</hi> are taken off.</p>
                              <p>We Å¿till continue Å¿owing of <hi>Spinage,</hi> for the beginning of <hi>Winter.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We take our <hi>Onions</hi> out of the Ground as Å¿oon as their Stems begin to dry, and we let them lie ten or twelve days a drying in the Air, before we lay them up in our Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Å¿ome other dry place, or elÅ¿e we bind them up in Ropes, becauÅ¿e otherwiÅ¿e they would ferment and rot, if they were laid up before they were dry.</p>
                              <p>We gather our <hi>Shalots</hi> at the very beginning of the Month, and draw our Garlick out of the Ground.</p>
                              <p>At the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> the <hi>FloriÅ¿ts</hi> Å¿et into the Earth their <hi>Jacinths,</hi> fair <hi>Anemonies</hi> and <hi>Ranunculus's</hi> or <hi>Crow-foots, Junquills, Totus Albus's</hi> and <hi>Imperials.</hi>

                              <p>We deÅ¿troy both ordinary <hi>Flies</hi> and <hi>WaÅ¿ps</hi> which eat the <hi>Figs,</hi> the <hi>MuÅ¿cat Grapes,</hi> and other Fruits, and for that effect, we tye Å¿ome <hi>Bottles</hi> or <hi>Cucurbit-glaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> full of water mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a little Honey, to Å¿ome of their Branches, by which means, thoÅ¿e inÅ¿ects being allured by the Å¿weetneÅ¿s of the Honey, enter into the necks of thoÅ¿e GlaÅ¿Å¿es, and Å¿o periÅ¿h in that mixture, but they muÅ¿t be emptied and Å¿hifted with new Water, as often as they begin to fill with thoÅ¿e little unlucky inÅ¿ects.</p>
                              <p>Though the firÅ¿t Bud of a Clove-gilliflower or Carnation is beautiful and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing, it do's not follow thence, that all the reÅ¿t will be Å¿o too.</p>
                              <p>The Beauties of a Carnation are, to be high and tall, well burniÅ¿ht and garniÅ¿ht, well ranged, of a lovely colour, well plumed and diÅ¿played, and of a perfectly Velvet-like Å¿oftneÅ¿s to the Touch.</p>
                              <p>At the beginning of this Month, we tread down the Å¿tems of <hi>Onions,</hi> and the Leaves of <hi>Beet-raves,</hi> or <hi>Red Beet Roots, Carots, ParÅ¿nips,</hi> &amp;c. or elÅ¿e we take off their Leaves quite, to make their Roots grow the bigger in the Ground, by hindering their Sap from Å¿pending it Å¿elf above Ground.</p>
                              <p>It is Å¿till a good SeaÅ¿on enough to lay <hi>Clove-gilliflowers</hi> and <hi>Carnations.</hi>

                              <p>During this whole Month we continue to remove <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants out of our <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eries,</hi> to reimplace thoÅ¿e tufts which are dead in our <hi>Beds,</hi> and we immediately water them, as we muÅ¿t do all Plants which we Å¿et a new.</p>

                              <p>About the fifteenth of the Month, we graff <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> upon <hi>Almond-Trees,</hi> and upon other <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> as they Å¿tand in the places where they are to remain; the Å¿ap being then too much diminiÅ¿hed to be in any capacity to overflow the <hi>Scutcheons.</hi>

                              <p>We tie up firÅ¿t with OÅ¿ier withs, and afterwards towards the fifteenth of the Month, we carefully wrap up with long Litter, or new Å¿traw, Å¿ome <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Cardons,</hi> and <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choke</hi> Plants, to have them whitened or Blanched about fifteen or twenty days after; But great care muÅ¿t be taken in wraping them up, to keep them perfectly upright, otherwiÅ¿e they will overÅ¿et, and Å¿nap in Å¿under on one Å¿ide; and to hinder the winds from laying them on one Å¿ide too, they muÅ¿t be fenced with a Bank of Earth of about a full foot high.</p>
                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, we plant <hi>Cabbages</hi> in NurÅ¿eries, in Å¿ome well Å¿heltred place, in order to replant them in their deÅ¿igned places aÅ¿Å¿oon as the <hi>Winter</hi> is over.</p>

The Å¿ame caution muÅ¿t be obÅ¿erved in all Plants that are to be tied, after which, we cut off the extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Leaves, to prevent the Å¿ap from aÅ¿cending and Å¿pending it Å¿elf to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, by which means it is kept down in the Buried Plant, and makes it grow thick.</p>

It Å¿hould be planted till the middle of <hi>September,</hi> at Å¿ix or Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Inches diÅ¿tance between Plant and Plant, that it may be replanted a Å¿econd time, and that nearer together, afterwards, at the beginning of <hi>September</hi> two or three Inches deep in the Earth, if it be dry and Å¿andy, or at leaÅ¿t in a Å¿loping Ground, without cutting off any thing from the Root, which has produced a little tuft, and it muÅ¿t

be covered in froÅ¿ty weather, to prevent the cold from rotting it to the very Heart, which caution being obÅ¿erved, it will keep till <hi>Lent,</hi> whereas <hi>Endive</hi> that is come to its full growth before the bitter cold weather, will not keep at all in <hi>Winter.</hi>

                              <p>Now is the proper time to make <hi>Plantations</hi> of all Å¿orts of <hi>Trees,</hi> and of <hi>GooÅ¿e-berry, Curran,</hi> and <hi>RaÅ¿p-berry Shrubs,</hi> and 'tis good to continue on till the end of <hi>March,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s it be when it Freezes hard, or when the Earth is covered with a great deal of <hi>Snow.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>During all the Å¿ame time, we Å¿et Trees and <hi>Shrubs</hi> in <hi>Baskets,</hi> which we diÅ¿poÅ¿e of in Å¿ome particular place, and eÅ¿pecially towards the <hi>Northern</hi> quarter. We Å¿et in them <hi>Standards</hi> as well as <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> keeping an exact account in writing of the order of the Å¿everal kinds. TheÅ¿e <hi>Baskets</hi> are to be placed at half a foot diÅ¿tance one from the other, and muÅ¿t be Å¿o well interred, that but juÅ¿t their Brims at moÅ¿t may be diÅ¿cerned above Ground: And we couch in thoÅ¿e <hi>Baskets,</hi> Å¿uch <hi>Trees</hi> as are deÅ¿igned for <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> juÅ¿t in the Å¿ame manner as if we were actually planting them by <hi>Walls,</hi> and thoÅ¿e which are deÅ¿igned to be planted in the open Air, we place upright in the middle of the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>AÅ¿Å¿oon as the <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> begin to appear, we begin to uÅ¿e the long Dung which we have been carefull to order to be brought and laid ready in needfull places; for example, if it be for <hi>Artichokes,</hi> we may keep them a little elevated towards the <hi>North,</hi> to Å¿erve them inÅ¿tead of a Å¿mall Å¿helter, till we cover them quite, or elÅ¿e if we be preÅ¿Å¿ed with work to be done elÅ¿ewhere, we cover them preÅ¿ently, always taking care however before we cover them, to cut off all that is withered from them. A little of this Dung Å¿erves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the firÅ¿t attacks, but we redouble our coverings as the <hi>Cold</hi> augments. They which are not provided with that Å¿ort of dry Dung, may uÅ¿e inÅ¿tead of it, Å¿uch dry Leaves as are gathered up in the neighbouring Woods.</p>
                              <p>If we have a mind to whiten for <hi>Chards</hi> any of the biggeÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants, we tie them below with two or three Bands, and then we wrap them about with long dry Dung, or Å¿traw, which we bind over them again, as we have already directed when we were Å¿peaking of <hi>Cardons.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In dry Soils, we earth up a little our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> which would be pernicious in wet Grounds, becauÅ¿e it would rot the <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants.</p>
                              <p>It is convenient to let the <hi>Artichokes</hi> alone Å¿o covered till the full <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>March</hi> be paÅ¿t, that being commonly very dangerous; and many Gard'ners are the cauÅ¿e of the loÅ¿s of their <hi>Artichokes,</hi> when they let themÅ¿elves be tempted by Å¿ome fair days in <hi>March,</hi> to take off their coverings quite, and to proceed to manuring them; for if we uncover them, it Å¿hould at moÅ¿t, be but a little, and we Å¿hould always have that caution, to leave the Dung cloÅ¿e by them, to be ready at hand to cover them again, in caÅ¿e the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> returns.</p>
                              <p>At the very beginning of the Month, before the <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> be come, we make an end of tying up our <hi>Endive</hi> that is big enough to Å¿uffer it, and we cover it with what we can get: we alÅ¿o cover our other <hi>Endive</hi> in the Å¿ame manner, which we could not tie up. It likewiÅ¿e whitens equally well; and it is very convenient, if we have a conÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to plant as many as we can of the biggeÅ¿t of them there, in tufts, as we Å¿hall further Å¿hew afterwards.</p>
                              <p>We cut down <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> Å¿talks when the Seed is Ripe, which we carefully lay up, if we be minded to Å¿ow any of them in the following <hi>Spring.</hi> It would be dangerous to cut thoÅ¿e Å¿talks Å¿ooner, as well becauÅ¿e of Å¿poiling the Seed, as the plants or Å¿tocks themÅ¿elves, which might by that means be irritated to an abortion, and producing before their time, Å¿ome pitiful Å¿orry little new Å¿hoots.</p>
                              <p>We take the advantage of Å¿ome fair dry weather, to lay up all we have a mind to keep for our Winters proviÅ¿ion; and for that effect, we take up the plants in tufts, with Earth hanging to them, before they be <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> bitten, and plant them very cloÅ¿e to one another in the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> which are for Example, all <hi>Roots,</hi> as <hi>Carrots, ParÅ¿nips,</hi> and <hi>Beet-raves,</hi> or <hi>Red Beet Roots,</hi> and <hi>Artichokes,</hi> which have Fruit. The <hi>Green</hi> ones are more proper for this purpoÅ¿e than the <hi>Violet</hi> ones, which are more tender and leÅ¿s able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the <hi>FroÅ¿t,</hi> and more apt to putrefie in that part next their Å¿tem, than the others which are more ruÅ¿tical and hardy. And alÅ¿o <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Cardons, Collyflowers</hi> and <hi>Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> as well the <hi>White,</hi> as the <hi>Wild</hi> Å¿ort, and even <hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Cellery,</hi> though both
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48210:210"/>
theÅ¿e laÅ¿t will keep well enough in the naked Earth, when they are well covered: But here it is to be noted, that <hi>Cellery</hi> when once whitened muÅ¿t be eaten preÅ¿ently, otherwiÅ¿e it would rot; And we muÅ¿t be carefull to raiÅ¿e Å¿ome of it late, that may remain Å¿mall in the Earth, without being very much covered, which Å¿erves for the latter end of <hi>February</hi> and the Month of <hi>March.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>ThoÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons who live near Woods, will do well to gather up the leaves there, not only to make uÅ¿e of for coverings, as I have Å¿aid, but likewiÅ¿e to lay them to rot in Å¿ome hole, the powder of them being very good, and eÅ¿pecially to make uÅ¿e of for mold.</p>
                              <p>We now open and lay bare the Roots of Trees that Å¿eem to languiÅ¿h, in order to take from about them the old Soil, cut off as much of their Roots as is found in an ill condition, and Earth them up again afterwards with good new Earth.</p>
                              <p>We make Å¿ome <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms.</hi> The method to make them well, is to chooÅ¿e Å¿ome Å¿pot of new, and as near as can be, light and Å¿andy Ground, and dig there a hollow <hi>Bed</hi> of five or Å¿ix Inches deep, of three or four wide throughout, and of what length we pleaÅ¿e. The Dung muÅ¿t be either of <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>Mule,</hi> and muÅ¿t be already pretty dry, and Å¿uch as has been piled up Å¿ome time: Then we make the <hi>Bed</hi> about two foot high, ranking and preÅ¿Å¿ing the Dung as cloÅ¿e and tight as we can, yet Å¿o diÅ¿poÅ¿ing it that the upper part of it may be raiÅ¿ed into a ridge like the Back of an AÅ¿Å¿e, that it may the better Å¿hoot off the waters to the right and left, which if they Å¿hould pierce through it, would rot the Dung; after that, we cover the <hi>Bed</hi> to the thickneÅ¿s of two foot more, with the Neighbouring Earth, over which again, we throw another covering of three or four Inches thick of Litter, which in the <hi>Winter</hi> may guard from the great <hi>Cold,</hi> and in the <hi>Summer,</hi> Å¿hade from the violent heat the <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms</hi> which may be expected to Å¿hoot up about three or four Months after.</p>
                              <p>We cleanÅ¿e Trees of MoÅ¿s that are troubled with it.</p>
                              <p>They which have great Plantations of <hi>Trees</hi> to prune, Å¿hould now begin that opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon thoÅ¿e which are leaÅ¿t vigorous.</p>
                              <p>We employ the long dry Dung of which we ought to have made proviÅ¿ion in the <hi>Summer,</hi> to cover our <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> as well thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Wall,</hi> as <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> and for theÅ¿e laÅ¿t, we tie all their Branches as cloÅ¿e as we can conveniently, together with OÅ¿ier Withs, that we may the more eaÅ¿ily wrap them about with this covering; and for the <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> we endeavour to leave Å¿o many of the higher Branches as we can, on the Å¿ides, and to tie Å¿everal of them together to poles or forked Å¿ticks that are to Å¿erve them for Props, and by that means too, we cover them with more eaÅ¿e, and leÅ¿s charge. We leave on them that covering till the full <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>March</hi> be paÅ¿t, at which time, we only take off part of it, till the full <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>April</hi> be likewiÅ¿e paÅ¿t, the <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> of theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t Months being dangerous to the young Fruit which then begins to put forth it Å¿elf, as the <hi>Winter FroÅ¿ts</hi> are to the Wood which they make to turn all into Pith.</p>
                              <p>They whoÅ¿e <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> are peÅ¿tered with <hi>Tiger Babbs,</hi> will do well now, not only to gather up the Leaves that are attack'd by them, to burn them immediately, but alÅ¿o to Å¿crape their Branches with the back of a Knife to clear them of the Eggs or Seed of that CurÅ¿ed <hi>InÅ¿ect,</hi> which remains Å¿ticking to them all <hi>Winter,</hi> for though we cannot Å¿o far prevail that way, as totally to exterminate them, yet however there will be Å¿o many Enemies deÅ¿troyed, as we deÅ¿troy of thoÅ¿e Eggs.</p>
                              <p>The days being now very Å¿hort, skilful Gard'ners will therefore work by Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light till Supper time, either in making of Straw-Screens and Coverings, or preparing Trees for planting, as Å¿oon as the FroÅ¿t permits them, or in deÅ¿igning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We put thoÅ¿e Trees into the Earth in furrows which we could not plant, covering up their Roots as carefully as if we were planting them in their deÅ¿igned places, without leaving any hollow Chinks about their Roots, becauÅ¿e otherwiÅ¿e the great FroÅ¿t would Å¿poil them.</p>
                              <p>We may begin at the latter end of the Month to force Å¿uch <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> as are at leaÅ¿t three or four years old, and this forcing is performed, either on the cold <hi>Bed</hi> in the place where they grow, which is the beÅ¿t way, or elÅ¿e upon a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> if we be minded to remove them. But ordinarily we Å¿tay till towards the beginning of the next Month, before we make any EÅ¿Å¿ays of that kind, it being in my Opinion, long enough to have of them for four Months together by Artifice, till <hi>Nature</hi> be ready to furniÅ¿h us with more of them for two Months longer by her own Å¿ole Virtue and Power, not but that we might begin to force them at the very beginning of <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="170" facs="tcp:48210:211"/>
The way of forcing them is, to dig the Earth out of a Path, to the depth of two Foot, and the breadth of one full foot and a half, if originally the Path were but three Foot over, becauÅ¿e there muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t Å¿ix or Å¿even good inches of Earth be left next the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> Tufts. The Path being thus voided, we fill it up with long hot Dung, very well ramm'd and trodden down, till it be a full foot higher than the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the <hi>Cold Bed,</hi> at the firÅ¿t making, and after fifteen days, we Å¿tir this Dung over again, mixing Å¿ome new Dung with it, the better to enable it to communicate Å¿ufficient heat to the two adjoyning <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> but if it appear too much mortified, Å¿o that the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> does not Å¿hoot up briskly enough, then this recruiting of the path-way with freÅ¿h Dung and Å¿tirring, muÅ¿t be repeated afterwards as often as it Å¿hall be neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which commonly happens to be once every ten or twelve days. If there fall any great Rains or Snow, that may have too much rotted that Dung, Å¿o that it appears not to retain a Å¿ufficient heat, then muÅ¿t it be quite taken away, and all new put in its place; for in fine, this <hi>Bed</hi> muÅ¿t always be kept extreamly hot; as to the <hi>Cold Bed,</hi> in which the Plants are, the Ground muÅ¿t be digged up, and Å¿tirred a little in it, to the depth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five Inches, as Å¿oon as the path-way is filled up, for it cannot be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauÅ¿e of bringing the Dung to that, (which cannot be done without much trampling on the Soil) which digging being finiÅ¿hed, we cover the Å¿aid <hi>Cold Bed</hi> with Å¿ome of the Å¿ame long Dung, to the thickneÅ¿s of three or four Inches, and at the end of fifteen days, Å¿o much time at leaÅ¿t being neceÅ¿Å¿ary to give activity to thoÅ¿e <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> Tufts, that in this SeaÅ¿on, are as 'twere dead, or at leaÅ¿t benumbed with the cold, we lift up the Dung to Å¿ee whether the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> begin to Å¿hoot or no, and if they do, at every place where they appear, we clap a <hi>GlaÅ¿s Bell,</hi> which we alÅ¿o take great care to cover cloÅ¿e with long Dung, and eÅ¿pecially a-nights, to prevent the FroÅ¿t from penetrating in the leaÅ¿t man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the World, to the <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> which being Å¿o extreamly tender and delicate as 'tis, would be abÅ¿olutely Å¿poiled by the leaÅ¿t breath of Cold. If in the day time, the Sun Å¿hine out a little bright, we muÅ¿t not fail to take off the Dung from the Bells, that the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> may be viÅ¿ited by thoÅ¿e kindly beams that animate all things, and if beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e Bells, we had likewiÅ¿e <hi>GlaÅ¿s Frames</hi> to clap over them, and Å¿o doubly to cover whole Beds of Plants, that would Å¿till be more commodious and more advantageous for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to effect this little <hi>MaÅ¿ter-piece</hi> of our <hi>Art.</hi> By theÅ¿e helps, the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> Å¿pringing out of that warm Earth, and meeting with a warm Air under thoÅ¿e <hi>Bells,</hi> grow red and green, and of the Å¿ame thickneÅ¿s and length as thoÅ¿e of the Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>I add here, that a Bed of <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> dextrouÅ¿ly forced, and well maintained, produces abundantly enough for a Fortnight or three Weeks, and that becauÅ¿e the King Å¿hould not want during the whole Winter, this new DiÅ¿h which he beholds with Å¿o gracious an Eye, as Å¿oon as the firÅ¿t Beds begin to furniÅ¿h him, I begin to force as many new ones, and Å¿o continue the Å¿ame courÅ¿e every three Weeks, till the end of <hi>April,</hi> when <hi>Nature</hi> advertiÅ¿es me, that 'tis time to put an end to thoÅ¿e Violences I have done Her, and that Å¿he is then willing in her Turn, to Å¿erve us Å¿ome DiÅ¿hes prepared by her own skill.</p>

                              <p>We muÅ¿t not fail at the beginning of this Month, to take up in <hi>Turf,</hi> the <hi>Cellery</hi> which we had planted at a reaÅ¿onable diÅ¿tance, in the Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> in particular <hi>Cold Beds;</hi> and when we have taken it up, to carry it into the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> or elÅ¿e to replant it in Å¿ome other <hi>Cold Bed,</hi> placing its Plants very cloÅ¿e together, that they may the more eaÅ¿ily be covered.</p>
                              <p>AÅ¿Å¿oon as the White <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> Å¿eem to be Å¿etled, we muÅ¿t cover our <hi>Winter-Lettuces</hi> which are planted in well Å¿heltred places, but not with dry Dung as other Plants, for fear Å¿ome of the filth Å¿hould get into the heart of thoÅ¿e that <hi>Cabbage,</hi> but with very clean <hi>Straw,</hi> upon which we lay Å¿ome long pole of Wood, to keep it in its place, and hinder the wind from blowing it off.</p>

                              <p>IF it be a pertinent caution I have given at the beginning of every Month, That we ought then to be careful to finiÅ¿h what we could not do in the preceeding Month, it is particularly neceÅ¿Å¿ary to repeat it at the beginning of this Month, with reÅ¿pect to that which laÅ¿t expired. AÅ¿Å¿oon as <hi>December</hi> is come it is no longer time to dally. For now the Earth in <hi>Gardens</hi> is quite Å¿trip'd of all its uÅ¿ual ornaments, and the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> that Å¿eldom fails to Å¿ignalize it Å¿elf this Month, without reÅ¿pecting the quality of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, Å¿pares no bodies <hi>Gardens,</hi> but unmercifully deÅ¿troys all it meets with of a nature too delicate to endure its rigour; and therefore it concerns us now to make an end of houÅ¿ing and of covering what we could not houÅ¿e or cover in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> viz. <hi>Endive, Cardons, Cellery, Artichokes, Roots, Collyflowers, Chard-Beets, Leeks, Fig-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. And above all things, we muÅ¿t be careful to preÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e <hi>Novelties</hi> which we may have begun to advance by <hi>Art,</hi> as <hi>Peas, Beans, Cabbage, Lettuce,</hi> and little <hi>Sallets,</hi>
                                 <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48210:212"/>
to avoid the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of Å¿eeing periÅ¿h in one bitter Night, what we have been labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three Months to advance.</p>
                              <p>We may likewiÅ¿e Å¿till at the beginning of the Month, continue to Å¿ow Å¿ome early <hi>Peas,</hi> upon Å¿ome banks made of Earth raiÅ¿ed in double Å¿lopes along by Å¿ome Wall placed in a good <hi>ExpoÅ¿ition,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially that towards the <hi>South.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We tranÅ¿port our rotten Dung to thoÅ¿e places we deÅ¿ign to muck, and Å¿pread them abroad there, that the rain and <hi>Snow</hi> waters may the better penetrate them, and carry their Salt a little below the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth where our Seeds are to be Å¿own.</p>
                              <p>We interr our <hi>Almonds</hi> in Å¿ome <hi>Basket,</hi> to Sprout. They Å¿hould have Å¿prouted by the Month of <hi>March,</hi> to be ready then to be planted in their allotted places. It is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prevent the great <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> from coming at them; for which end the <hi>Baskets</hi> muÅ¿t be houÅ¿ed up in the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> or elÅ¿e well covered with long Dung if left in the naked Earth. The way to lay theÅ¿e <hi>Almonds</hi> to Å¿prout, is firÅ¿t to lay at the bottom of the <hi>Basket,</hi> a layer of Sand, Earth or mold, or made Earth between two and three Inches thick, and to lay a Layer of flat <hi>Almonds,</hi> upon it with their Å¿harp ends inwards, till its firÅ¿t layer of Earth be quite covered with the layer of <hi>Almonds,</hi> upon which we lay a Å¿econd layer of Mold or Sand of two Inches thick, and then upon that again a Å¿econd layer of <hi>Almonds</hi> placed in the Å¿ame manner as the firÅ¿t, and Å¿o a third and fourth, &amp;c. till the <hi>Basket</hi> will hold no more.</p>
                              <p>It is likewiÅ¿e not amiÅ¿s to put one Å¿ingle layer of <hi>Almonds</hi> into the naked-Earth, and to cover them with Earth, to the thickneÅ¿s of about three Inches: When they begin to come up at the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> we take them in up <hi>Turfs,</hi> that is, with Å¿ome Earth hanging to them, and breaking off their Å¿prouts, we replant them in their deÅ¿igned places, in rows diÅ¿tant one from another, a foot and a half, and in thoÅ¿e rows, the <hi>Almonds</hi> muÅ¿t be placed at the diÅ¿tance of half a foot from each other.</p>
                              <p>We are buÅ¿ie in making trails for <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We may prune <hi>Trees</hi> as long as there is no Icicles, or hoar upon the Branches, and as the hard <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> do not raign, for they harden the Wood Å¿o that the pruning knife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaÅ¿ily paÅ¿s: Always obÅ¿erving that we muÅ¿t never prune <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> without unnail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, becauÅ¿e it would be too troubleÅ¿om to do it otherwiÅ¿e, neither can we Å¿o well diÅ¿cern what Work we are to do.</p>
                              <p>One of the moÅ¿t principal Works of this Month, is, at the beginning of it, to make a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> of long new Dung of the ordinary breadth of four foot, and height of three, and aÅ¿Å¿oon as its great heat is Å¿pent, we muÅ¿t Å¿ow upon it, under <hi>GlaÅ¿s Bells,</hi> Å¿ome good bright <hi>Curled Lettuce,</hi> and aÅ¿Å¿oon as 'tis grown a little big, which uÅ¿ually happens in a Month's time, we muÅ¿t take up the faireÅ¿t, and plant it in a <hi>NurÅ¿ery</hi> upon another <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> and under other <hi>Bells,</hi> to the number of twenty, or twenty five under every <hi>Bell,</hi> and when they are grown reaÅ¿onably big there too, we muÅ¿t take up the biggeÅ¿t with a little Earth about them, to replant them to the number of five or Å¿ix under each <hi>Bell,</hi> to remain there till they be quite <hi>Cabbaged,</hi> which uÅ¿ually happens towards the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> and we take care to fence them well from the <hi>Cold,</hi> as well with coverings of Litter, as by new heating their <hi>Beds.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We practiÅ¿e the Å¿ame method in Å¿owing theÅ¿e <hi>Lettuces</hi> in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> and in replanting in <hi>February,</hi> that we may have Å¿ome ready betimes, that is, towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> and to continue Å¿o doing till the Earth produces us Å¿ome of her Å¿elf, without the help of <hi>Hot</hi> Dung. At this time they that employ themÅ¿elves in rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Novelties,</hi> Å¿pend the moÅ¿t part of each day in covering them at night, and uncovering them in the morning, or elÅ¿e all comes to nothing.</p>
                              <p>When in the Winter time, we are raiÅ¿ing and forcing of <hi>Lettuce</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and under Bells, we muÅ¿t be careful often to lift up the Bells, to take away the dead Leaves, there being a great many that rot and periÅ¿h, and one rotten Leaf rots others. The inÅ¿ide of the Bells muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be cleanÅ¿ed from the filth and moiÅ¿ture that gathers there in abundance, and when there comes a fair Sun Å¿hiny day, we muÅ¿t not fail to lift up the Bells, that the moiÅ¿ture may be dryed up that Å¿ticks about the Leaves. But the chiefeÅ¿t thing to be obÅ¿erved above all, is to keep the Beds moderately hot, by recruiting and new heating, and fermenting them from time to time.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>How to judge certainly by viewing and viÅ¿iting a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> whether there be any thing wanting in it, which it Å¿hould be Å¿tockt with.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is no inconÅ¿iderable thing to underÅ¿tand certainly, not only what ProviÅ¿ions a Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Garden well maintained and ordered may furniÅ¿h us with every Month in the Year, but likewiÅ¿e what works are to be done there in every SeaÅ¿on, by an able Gard'ner, but yet that is not enough to make a Gentleman Å¿o knowing, as to be able to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf the PleaÅ¿ure to judge certainly by viewing of his <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> whether it be indeed Å¿o well Å¿tockt or no, as to want nothing that it Å¿hould have. For in fine, we muÅ¿t not expect always actually to find init, all the advantages we are beholding to Gardens for. We know indeed, that it Å¿hould bring forth a proviÅ¿ion for the whole Year, but we know very well too, that it does not bring forth all days in the Year, for example, in the Winter Months we hardly Å¿ee in it any of its Productions, the moÅ¿t part of them being then carried out of it, and laid up in Store-houÅ¿es and ConÅ¿ervatories. And beÅ¿ides, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Plants that are to be Å¿een in it at other times, how many is there which have not then attain'd to their perfection, which yet ought to make a Figure in this Garden, though they require perhaps two or three, and Å¿ometimes five or Å¿ix Months time to arrive to it? Thus it is in the beginning of the Spring, with all Legumes or Edible Plants, and green things, and thus it is too in the <hi>Summer,</hi> with the principal Fruits of the other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, upon which ConÅ¿ideration, I thought it not impertinent nor unuÅ¿eful, to Å¿hew yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48210:215"/>
a little more particularly wherein conÅ¿iÅ¿ts the excellency and accompliÅ¿hment of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> judging of it acccording to the proportion of what we ought to find in it every time we go into it, and to give you the more exact and perfect an Idea of it, I will as near as I can, draw you the picture of our Kings, which is in its kind, the greateÅ¿t that ever was beheld, as its MaÅ¿ter is the greateÅ¿t Prince that ever yet appeared; not, that I exhibit this Picture to engage any PerÅ¿on to copy it, but only to direct them how by the Rules of a juÅ¿t CompariÅ¿on, and proportion of great things to little, they may take Å¿uch MeaÅ¿ures, as they Å¿hall think moÅ¿t accommodated to their own particular conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
                        <p>I will begin this Chapter with the Month of <hi>January,</hi> as I have done the two next preceeding ones, and Å¿hall tell you firÅ¿t, That in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> we ought to <note place="margin">January.</note> be very well Å¿atisfied with the Garden in QueÅ¿tion, if we find in it a reaÅ¿onable quantity of <hi>Winter Lettuces</hi> planted in Borders by Walls, and covered with long Straw, or Straw Screens. And Secondly, if we find in it Å¿ome Squares of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> and <hi>Beet-Chards</hi> well covered with long Dung, with the like proviÅ¿ion of <hi>Cellery, Endive, Common ParÅ¿ly,</hi> and <hi>Macedonian ParÅ¿ly,</hi> or <hi>AliÅ¿anders,</hi> &amp;c. and ordered after the Å¿ame manner. And in the third place, Å¿ome <hi>Winter Cabbages, Ciboules, Sorrel,</hi> and <hi>Sallet</hi> Furnitures, and if theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t be Å¿heltred with Å¿ome Å¿ort of Covering. And if in the fourth place there be Å¿ome Å¿quares of <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> without any other Artifice, than what is uÅ¿ed to warm and force them in their <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> as I do, and have begun to do in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December.</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kitchen-plants muÅ¿t be houÅ¿ed and laid up, as <hi>Roots, Onions, Cardons, Artichokes, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyflowers,</hi> &amp;c. In the fifth place, we may be content if we find the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> well covered, all places where Trees Å¿hould be, well filled up with <hi>Trees,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t, with holes dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and Trenches prepared, ready for planting them, or the Roots of thoÅ¿e bared and laid open, that begin to languiÅ¿h, in order to their Cure. Sixthly, if we Å¿ee Men buÅ¿ie in clearing the Fruit-Trees of MoÅ¿s, and other filth that Spoils them, and if over and above that, we find there any <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for the Novelties of the Spring time, Å¿uch as are <hi>Strawberries, RadiÅ¿hes, Little Sallets, Peas, Beans, Cabbage Lettuces, ParÅ¿ly, Cucumbers,</hi> and <hi>Musk-melon</hi> Plantations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we likewiÅ¿e Å¿ee Å¿ome <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> and Å¿ome other Trees forced and advanced by artificial Warmth, what then ought we not to Å¿ay in praiÅ¿e of the Gard'ner, eÅ¿pecially if we find the Walks and Alleys kept neat and clean, and no Garden Tools or UtenÅ¿ils any where neglected?</p>
                        <p>Having told you what Å¿hould compoÅ¿e the Beauty of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> I think it needleÅ¿s to add any DeÅ¿cription of what makes it imperfect and diÅ¿agreeable as well in that Month, as in all the reÅ¿t of which I Å¿hall afterwards treat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e any Body may eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cern of himÅ¿elf, that 'tis juÅ¿t the contrary and reverÅ¿e of what I have juÅ¿t now Å¿pecified, that is to Å¿ay, a want of any thing that Å¿hould be in it, Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, SlovinglyneÅ¿s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we are to look upon as the MonÅ¿ters of <hi>Kitchen Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> we muÅ¿t certainly expect to Å¿ee the beginning of a great BuÅ¿tling and Activity in Garden works, we Å¿hould now find the moÅ¿t part of thoÅ¿e things <note place="margin">February.</note> flouriÅ¿hing, and grown pretty forward, that we told you were to be raiÅ¿ed on <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> in the preceeding Month, and if about the latter end of the Month, the Weather appear pretty temperate, and there happen Å¿o conÅ¿iderable a Thaw as to promiÅ¿e an end of the great cold, our Gard'ners Å¿hould then begin to dig and manure the Squares and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Borders prepare the <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> Å¿ow thoÅ¿e Å¿orts of Seeds that are long coming up, as <hi>ParÅ¿ly, Onions, Ciboules, Leeks,</hi> &amp;c. They muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e now earneÅ¿tly mind the pruning of Trees, as well <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> as <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and paliÅ¿ade or nail up theÅ¿e laÅ¿t for the firÅ¿t time, and particularly they muÅ¿t take care to make <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for the replanting of <hi>Musk-melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and for little <hi>Sallets, RadiÅ¿hes, Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>March,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi> begins to pleaÅ¿ure us with both indifferent fair, and pretty long days, and nature begins viÅ¿ibly to grow warm and active, our <hi>Gard'ners</hi> alÅ¿o Å¿hould <note place="margin">March.</note> with new and freÅ¿h vigour, and Application, beÅ¿tir themÅ¿elves in all parts of their <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and be Å¿een indefatigably to purÅ¿ue all the works I have mentioned in the particular TreatiÅ¿e I made on that Å¿ubject, and which therefore 'tis not neceÅ¿Å¿ary to repeat here again; Å¿o that if the extent of our Ground be great, and the number of Labourers propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, we Å¿hould have the pleaÅ¿ure with one caÅ¿t of an Eye to Å¿ee them diging, making up, Å¿owing, planting, howing, weeding, graffing, pruning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for in fine, before the Month be out, the moÅ¿t part of the Ground Å¿hould be taken up either with Seeds or plants, which are to Å¿erve for proviÅ¿ion for the whole year. All that was before covered with Dung, ought to be diÅ¿charged of its coverings, which are now grown hidious, aÅ¿Å¿oon as they ceaÅ¿e to be neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and every thing ought to breath the free Air, which begins now to cheer both Animals and Plants; we Å¿hould at this time have at leaÅ¿t Å¿omething to begin to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48210:215"/>
gather, either of <hi>Sallets</hi> or <hi>RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> of the new SeaÅ¿on, if the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> of the foregoing Months have not as yet obliged us with that pleaÅ¿ure; But neatneÅ¿s and politeneÅ¿s ought particularly to glitter every where, and Å¿erve for a varniÅ¿h to all the Alleys, and the dreÅ¿Å¿ed Grounds, that together with the firÅ¿t dawning of the riÅ¿ing Green that is now Å¿pringing out of the Womb of the teeming Earth, and the perfumed breath of thoÅ¿e Plants which Heavens richer influences have made odoriferous, and the abundance of <hi>Flowers</hi> which begin to diÅ¿play their beauties on every Å¿ide, and the harmony of the pretty Birds, which a Å¿ort of extraordinary gayety and briskneÅ¿s at this time inÅ¿pires with amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous prattle, and with melodious Airs to Å¿trive to out-vie each other. This neatneÅ¿s may concurr to make a Theater of pleaÅ¿ure univerÅ¿ally perfect, which may with irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible allurements intice the curious to the divertiÅ¿ement of walking in Å¿o delicious a place.</p>
                        <p>In the Month of <hi>April,</hi> we are not to find any thing new to be done in our <hi>Kitchen-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">April.</note> unleÅ¿s it be an augmentation of <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers.</hi> The Earth in them Å¿hould now be covered almoÅ¿t all over with a new decoration of Infant Plants; Here we Å¿hould Å¿ee <hi>Artichokes</hi> riÅ¿ing as 'twere from the dead, and there <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> piercing the Ground in a thouÅ¿and places; here we Å¿hould with pleaÅ¿ure obÅ¿erve the <hi>Cabbage Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce</hi> wind up it Å¿elf into round Balls, and here that multitude of Green Herbs, and <hi>Legumes,</hi> Å¿o different in colour, and Å¿o various in their Å¿hapes; TheÅ¿e, theÅ¿e are the Innocent and natural Dainties which there preÅ¿ent themÅ¿elves for the nouriÅ¿hment, and Delicious entertainment of Humane kind. The <hi>Jacinth,</hi> the <hi>Tulip,</hi> the <hi>Anemone,</hi> the <hi>Ranimculus,</hi> and Å¿o many other <hi>Flowers,</hi> with what Glories do they not adorn the <hi>Gardens</hi> where they are? That which is here to be remarked, is only the ordinary main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of what is already done and perfected; but that which Å¿hould moÅ¿t take up our thoughts is the hopes of a future crop of <hi>Fruits,</hi> every one now being eager to run and view the <hi>Trees</hi> that Å¿hed their BloÅ¿Å¿oms, to Å¿ee whether much <hi>Fruit</hi> knit upon them or no, or elÅ¿e to viÅ¿it the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> of <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers</hi> that Å¿eem to have taken well, to Å¿ee how liberally they are like to recompence them for all the pains beÅ¿towed upon them.</p>
                        <p>When the Month of <hi>May</hi> comes in, what contentment have we not in uÅ¿eful <note place="margin">May.</note> 
                           <hi>Gardens;</hi> and how great are the Å¿weets of enjoyment which we begin then to taÅ¿te? We have now no longer occaÅ¿ion to demand why Å¿uch and Å¿uch Å¿pots of Ground are yet bare, SpaniÅ¿h <hi>Cardons, Collyflowers, Chard-Beets, Cellery,</hi> and even <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage Lettuces,</hi> which were not to appear Å¿o early, and for which thoÅ¿e places were deÅ¿igned, coming to occupy them at the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of this Month, and <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> which becauÅ¿e of the delicateneÅ¿s of its temper, had till now been retain'd in the Seed CloÅ¿et, comes out at this time to gild the Earth, and to offer it Å¿elf in abundance to pleaÅ¿ure its MaÅ¿ter. The <hi>Straw-berries</hi> beginning to come now to maturity open and lead the way to the other <hi>Red Fruits</hi> which are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to follow after them: <hi>Green Peas</hi> are ready to Å¿atisfie the longing Appetire of the lickeriÅ¿h Palate. <hi>MuÅ¿hrooms</hi> Å¿hoot up in Crowds; and in fine, of all the things contained in the Alphabet I have premiÅ¿ed before this TreatiÅ¿e, there is hardly any but <hi>Spinage,</hi> and <hi>MÃ¢ches,</hi> that Å¿tave off the performance of their duty till <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> for we may now Å¿ee Å¿ome little beginnings even of <hi>Endive,</hi> and if <hi>HaÅ¿ting</hi> or <hi>Early Cherries</hi> were the firÅ¿t <hi>Fruit</hi> that appeared in this Month of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>HaÅ¿ting Apricocks,</hi> the <hi>Little MuÅ¿cat Pears,</hi> and the <hi>Avant Peaches,</hi> or <hi>Forward Peaches</hi> will not leave them long alone to enjoy the glory of being the Å¿ole Riches and Ornaments of our <hi>Gardens,</hi> all theÅ¿e <hi>Fruits</hi> being now preparing themÅ¿elves to appear in a very few days; the <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> likewiÅ¿e will not Å¿tay long behind them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while the <hi>Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> with an infinite number both of <hi>Lettuces</hi> and of other Plants, Å¿atisfie both our Palates and NeceÅ¿Å¿ities, as the <hi>Flowers</hi> together with the <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which in <hi>Mid-May</hi> we carry abroad out of their houÅ¿es, perform likewiÅ¿e their functions in delighting both our Sight and Smell.</p>
                        <p>The parching heat of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> hinders us indeed from going into our <note place="margin">June.</note> 
                           <hi>Garden</hi> in the heat of the day, but what charms are there not in going to viÅ¿it it Morning and Evening, when the cool breathings of a gentle Zephir reign there with Sovereign Å¿way? Now is the SeaÅ¿on when we may viÅ¿ibly perceive with our Eyes, all things to grow and thrive, and Å¿ee a Branch that five or Å¿ix days before, was not above a foot long, now Å¿hot out to three or four. <hi>Leeks</hi> are now planted, and Å¿quares covered with Green Herbs, compleat the tapeÅ¿try; that odorns the Ground the Vine <hi>Flowers</hi> make an end of throughly embalming the air which was already all over perfumed with the grateful odour of the <hi>Straw-berries.</hi>

We gather in all parts, and at the Å¿ame time with profuÅ¿ion diÅ¿tribute all thoÅ¿e Plants that are become Å¿o beautiful and accompliÅ¿h'd; we fill up the places again we had disfurniÅ¿h'd, Å¿o that there hardly ever remains any part void; and nature now affects no better divertiÅ¿ement than to be amazing us with miracles of fertillity, Å¿o well aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted as Å¿he is, by the kindly warmth of the Father of Light; only Å¿he needs now and then the Auxiliary refreÅ¿hment of convenient moiÅ¿ture, moiÅ¿ture which the propitious Clouds Å¿ometimes abundantly pour down, but which Å¿ometimes the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> InduÅ¿try too is fain to Å¿upply her with in time of need. The <hi>Cold Beds</hi> and <hi>Counterborders</hi> Levelled and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿ted Å¿o even to a line, and Å¿o well furniÅ¿h'd with <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> what pleaÅ¿ure do they not afford to behold them? That foreÅ¿t of <hi>Artichokes</hi> of different colours which appears in a Å¿elect and particular place, doth it not call out to the curious to come and admire them, and more eÅ¿pecially to judge of their goodneÅ¿s and delicacy, whilÅ¿t they are alÅ¿o paÅ¿Å¿ing their opinions of their beauty and abundance? The <hi>PaliÅ¿ades</hi> and <hi>Pole-Hedges</hi> Å¿o exquiÅ¿itely well extended, and reÅ¿ounding with the warbling notes of chirping Birds which we paÅ¿s through in going to this <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> commence the pleaÅ¿ure of their walk, compleat it at their going back, and inÅ¿pire them with a longing deÅ¿ire to return again with all convenient Å¿peed.</p>
                        <p>In theÅ¿e two Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t, Kitchen-Gardens</hi> Å¿hould be Å¿o richly and happily endowed with whatÅ¿oever their condition is capable of, that we may find plenty <note place="margin">July <hi>and</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guÅ¿t.</note> of all things there both to Å¿atisfie the pleaÅ¿ures of the preÅ¿ent, and provide for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ities of the future time, Å¿o that let us require of them what we pleaÅ¿e, they may be as ready to anÅ¿wer as we to make our Demands.</p>
                        <p>As for example have we a mind to all or any Å¿orts of Herbs, Roots, <hi>Sallets, Perfumes,</hi> &amp;c. They will immediately furniÅ¿h us with them; have we a fancy to any <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> thoÅ¿e chief and principal <hi>Fruits</hi> of our <hi>Climate?</hi> we may Å¿mell them a great way off, and need but follow our noÅ¿es and go and viÅ¿it them, and Å¿toop and gather them; Would we have any <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> flat <hi>Pumpions,</hi> or other <hi>Pumpions</hi> or <hi>Citrulls, MuÅ¿hrooms,</hi> &amp;c. They will preÅ¿ent us with Å¿tore of them; Do our Appetites further crave after <hi>Artichokes,</hi> or <hi>Pears, Plums, Figs.</hi> &amp;c. we may be Å¿ure to find there a conÅ¿iderable quantity of all thoÅ¿e things; or, Have we a mind likewiÅ¿e to have any Å¿weet and Aromatical Herbs, as <hi>Time, Sage, Savory,</hi> &amp;c. or any reliÅ¿hing Plants, as <hi>Garlick, Onions, Ciboules, Leeks, Rocamboles,</hi> or <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Garlick,</hi> &amp;c. There we need not fear to be Å¿upplied. Nay, the four or five next preceeding Months Å¿eem only to have laboured for theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t, Å¿o that we may expect all Å¿hould go well in our <hi>Gardens</hi> in this Å¿eaÅ¿on, if we be provided with a good <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and which above all things, has the skill to chuÅ¿e well, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to know how and when to gather.

                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is certain, there are certain Å¿orts of Grounds which want none of the good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required to make them produce in every SeaÅ¿on, and for a long time together, all Å¿orts of fair and good <hi>Legumes,</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿ing always, that they be reaÅ¿onably well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: And there are Å¿ome that beÅ¿ides that, have the faculty to produce them more early Å¿ome than others, and they are Å¿uch Grounds as they commonly call Black Sands, in which is found an equal temper between dry and moiÅ¿t, accompanied with a good expoÅ¿ition, and with an inexhauÅ¿tible Salt of fertility, rendring them eaÅ¿ie to be entred by the Å¿pade, and to be penetrated by the rain waters: But on the other hand, it is no leÅ¿s certain that it is rare enough to find any of theÅ¿e perfect Å¿orts of Earth, and that on the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48210:217"/>
contrary, it is very uÅ¿ual to meet with thoÅ¿e that offend either in being too dry, light, and parching, or over moiÅ¿t, heavy and cold, or elÅ¿e by being unfortunately Å¿ituated, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿ome of them too high, Å¿ome too Å¿loping, and Å¿ome again too low, and too much in a bottom. Happy are thoÅ¿e Gard'ners that meet with thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t Å¿orts of Ground that are Å¿o admirably well diÅ¿poÅ¿ed for Cultivation, in which they have hardly ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bad Å¿ucceÅ¿s to fear, but commonly all manner of good Fortune to expect: on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿ide unhappy, or at leaÅ¿t much to be pitied are thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Lot it is to have always Å¿ome of the great Enemies of Vegetation to combat with, I mean, either great drought, or more eÅ¿pecially exceÅ¿Å¿ive moiÅ¿ture, becauÅ¿e this laÅ¿t, beÅ¿ides that it is always attended with a chilling cold that retards its productions, is likewiÅ¿e apt to rot the greateÅ¿t part of the Plants, and conÅ¿equently, it is very difficult to correct, and almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to Å¿urmount Å¿o great a defect, but it is not altogether Å¿o difficult to qualifie a dry temper, for provided it be not extream great, and that we have the convenience of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to water it, and of Dung to amend and inrich it, we are MaÅ¿ters of two Soveraign and Infallible Remedies, which we muÅ¿t apply for its cure. And Å¿o by care and pains we may get the ConqueÅ¿t over thoÅ¿e dry and Å¿tubborn Lands, and force them to bring forth in abundance all things we Å¿hall regularly demand of them.</p>
                        <p>It follows thence, that when we are Å¿o happy as to meet with thoÅ¿e choice good Å¿orts of Ground, we may indifferently both Å¿ow and plant every where in them, any Å¿orts of Legumes or Plants whatÅ¿oever, with an aÅ¿Å¿ured Confidence, that they will proÅ¿per there. The only Subjection we are obliged to in Å¿uch Grounds is, firÅ¿t, to weed much, becauÅ¿e they produce abundance of Weeds among the good Herbs, and Å¿econdly to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten removing our Legumes, and changing their places, which is an eÅ¿Å¿ential point of Practice in all Å¿orts of Gardens, it being not at all convenient to place for two or three times together, the Å¿ame Vegetables in the Å¿ame piece of Ground, becauÅ¿e the Nature of the Earth requires theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Changes, as being as 'twere aÅ¿Å¿ured in this DiverÅ¿ity, to find wherewithall to recruit and perpetuate its firÅ¿t vigour. And though in thoÅ¿e good Grounds all things proÅ¿per admirably well, yet is it a moÅ¿t undoubted truth, that <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> ExpoÅ¿itions are here as well as every where elÅ¿e, more proper than thoÅ¿e of the <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> to forward, and improve its productions, witneÅ¿s <hi>Strawberries, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting Peas, Cherries</hi> and <hi>MuÅ¿cat-Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> To balance which, theÅ¿e laÅ¿t ExpoÅ¿itions have likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome peculiar advantages, that make them to be eÅ¿teemed in their turn; for Example, during the exceÅ¿Å¿ive heats of <hi>Summer,</hi> that often Å¿corch up every thing, and make our Legumes and other plants run up too haÅ¿tily to Seed, they are exempt from thoÅ¿e violent impreÅ¿Å¿ions, which the Sun makes upon thoÅ¿e places that are fully expoÅ¿ed to his burning Rays, and conÅ¿equently our Plants will, maintain themÅ¿elves longer in good plight in thoÅ¿e Å¿ituations than in the others.</p>
                        <p>It alÅ¿o follows from hence, that if any PerÅ¿on have Ground, though tolerably good, yet not of an equal goodneÅ¿s all over, either cauÅ¿ed by the difference of its natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Å¿ituation, and Å¿loping inclination upwards or downwards, that then I Å¿ay, the skill and induÅ¿try of the Gard'ner Å¿hews it Å¿elf, by knowing how to allot every plant the place in which it may beÅ¿t come to maturity in every SeaÅ¿on, as well in regard of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneÅ¿s, and Å¿ometimes of BackwardneÅ¿s, as of its outward Beauty, and inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>Generally Å¿peaking, thoÅ¿e Grounds that are moderately dry, light, and Å¿andy, and Å¿uch as though they be a little Å¿trong and heavy, are Å¿ituated on a gentle riÅ¿ing towards the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> and are backed by great Mountains, or fenced by high Walls againÅ¿t the Cold Winds, are more diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to produce the Novelties of the Spring, than the Å¿trong, heavy, fat and moiÅ¿t Sands, but likewiÅ¿e on the other Hand, in Summers when there falls but little Rain, theÅ¿e laÅ¿t produce thicker and better nouriÅ¿ht Legumes, and require not Å¿uch large and frequent Waterings, Å¿o that we may find Å¿ome Å¿ort of ConÅ¿ola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Satisfaction in all Å¿orts of Grounds.</p>
                        <p>However though abÅ¿olutely Å¿peaking, all things that may enter into a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> may grow in all Å¿orts of Grounds that are not altogether Barren, yet it has been obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all times, that all Å¿orts of Earth agree not equally with all Å¿orts of Plants, our able Market Gard'ners in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris,</hi> juÅ¿tifie the truth of this by a moÅ¿t convincing Experience, for we Å¿ee that Å¿uch of them whoÅ¿e Gardens are in Sandy Grounds, Å¿eldom mind to plant in them any <hi>Artichokes, Collyflowers, Beet-Chards, Onions, Cardons, Cellery, Beet-raves</hi> or <hi>Red Beet-Roots,</hi> and other Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoÅ¿e do that have theirs in Å¿tronger and more hearty Lands, and on the contrary, theÅ¿e laÅ¿t employ not their Ground in <hi>Sorrel, PurÅ¿lain, Lettuce, Endive,</hi> and other Å¿mall plants that are delicate and Å¿ubject to periÅ¿h with Mildew, and the wet rot as do thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Gardens are in light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Lands.</p>

                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48210:217"/>
From all that I have aÅ¿Å¿erted, there reÅ¿ult two things, the firÅ¿t is, that an able Gard'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which has a pretty dry or hilly Ground to cultivate with an Obligation to have of all Å¿orts of things in his Garden, Å¿hould place in the moiÅ¿teÅ¿t parts thoÅ¿e plants that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little moiÅ¿ture to bring them to perfection, as <hi>Artichokes, Red Beet-Roots, Scorzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera's, SalÅ¿iÅ¿ies, Carrots, ParÅ¿nips, Skirrets, Beet-Chards, Collyflowers</hi> and <hi>Cabbages, Spinage, Common Peas, Beans, Currans, GooÅ¿eberries, RaÅ¿pberries, Onions, Ciboules, Leeks, ParÅ¿ly, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, RadiÅ¿hes, Patience</hi> or <hi>Dock-Sorrel, Sweet Herbs, Borage BugloÅ¿s,</hi> &amp;c. And (Å¿uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing the ProviÅ¿ions above Å¿pecified, without which nothing will be Å¿ightly, be already planted in its other parts) he Å¿hould fill up the drier parts of the Å¿ame Garden with <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces</hi> of all SeaÅ¿ons, <hi>Endive, Succory, Chervil, Tarragon, BaÅ¿il, Burnet, Mint,</hi> and other Sallet-Furnitures, and <hi>PurÅ¿lain, Garlick, Shalots, Winter-Cabbages, Hot Beds</hi> of all Å¿orts of Plants, and of little Sallets; he may likewiÅ¿e plant in the Å¿ame places what <hi>Grapes</hi> he has a mind to, and he muÅ¿t place his <hi>Legumes</hi> there at moderate diÅ¿tances, becauÅ¿e they grow not of Å¿o large a Size and Stature there, as in fatter places. And laÅ¿tly, he muÅ¿t keep his Walks and Path-ways higher than his dreÅ¿Å¿ed Grounds, as well to draw into theÅ¿e latter the Rain waters that would be but unuÅ¿eful and incommodious in the Walks, as to render the artificial waterings he Å¿hall be obliged to uÅ¿e, of the greater advantage to them, by preventing them from running out any where aÅ¿ide, which muÅ¿t be one of his principal Applications.</p>
                        <p>He muÅ¿t alÅ¿o chuÅ¿e out in the Å¿ame Grounds thoÅ¿e Parts which come the neareÅ¿t to the good temper between dry and moiÅ¿t, for the raiÅ¿ing of <hi>AÅ¿paragus, Strawberries, Cardons, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Plants languiÅ¿h with drowth in places too dry, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h with rottenneÅ¿s in parts over-moiÅ¿t. He muÅ¿t place in the Borders under his Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Walls his <hi>Alleluia's, Latter Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Bourdelais,</hi> or <hi>Verjuice Grapes,</hi> and in the Counter-Borders of the Å¿ame Northern Quarter, he may make his <hi>NurÅ¿ery Beds</hi> for <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and Å¿ow <hi>Chervil</hi> all the Summer long, the North Å¿ide in all Å¿orts of Grounds, being moÅ¿t proper for thoÅ¿e purpoÅ¿es. And as this Gard'ner Å¿hould be curious of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, he ought to look upon the Banks under the Walls towards the South and EaÅ¿t to be a marvellous and favourable Å¿helter for the raiÅ¿ing them; as for Example, for the procuring of <hi>Strawberries</hi> and early <hi>Peas</hi> at the beginning of <hi>May, Violets</hi> at the entrance of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces</hi> at the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> He Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e plant in the dreÅ¿Å¿ed Banks next to the Å¿ame EaÅ¿tern and WeÅ¿tern Walls, his NurÅ¿ery of <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and Å¿ow there his <hi>Winter Lettuces,</hi> that is, <hi>Shell-Lettuces,</hi> to remain there all Autumn and Winter, till in the Spring it be time to tranÅ¿plant them into the places where they are to come to perfection; He Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e plant in the Borders of the Å¿ame Walls, his <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿e-pierre,</hi> or <hi>Sampire,</hi> which he can hardly have by any other means, which courÅ¿e is to be followed in all Å¿orts of Gardens; and in the Winter time he Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e obÅ¿erve this particular caution to throw all the Snow off from the neighbouring places upon the dreÅ¿Å¿ed Borders of thoÅ¿e <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e of the EaÅ¿tern Quarter, both for the erecting of a Magazine, as 'twere of moiÅ¿ture in Å¿uch places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Rain but Å¿eldom falls, as upon thoÅ¿e in which the violent heat of Summer is like to be of pernicious influence.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd thing that ReÅ¿ults from what I before laid down, is, That the Gard'ner whoÅ¿e Garden is in a very fat and moiÅ¿t Ground, muÅ¿t take a quite contrary method with all his Plants to that juÅ¿t now above mentioned; always aÅ¿Å¿uring himÅ¿elf that thoÅ¿e parts of it which are very moiÅ¿t, unleÅ¿s he can find means to drain and render them lighter, will be of no other uÅ¿e to him than to produce noxious Weeds, and conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thoÅ¿e which partake the leaÅ¿t of that intemperature, whether by their own Nature and Situation, or by the care and induÅ¿try of the ingenious Gard'ner, are always to be lookt upon as the beÅ¿t for all Å¿orts of things. He muÅ¿t place in the drieÅ¿t parts moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Plants that keep in their places for Å¿everal years together, excepting <hi>Currans, GooÅ¿e-berries,</hi> and <hi>RaÅ¿pberry</hi> BuÅ¿hes; as for Example, <hi>AÅ¿paragus, Artichokes, Strawberries, Wild Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> &amp;c. In other places, let him put thoÅ¿e things which in Summer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the leaÅ¿t time to come to perfection, <hi>viz. Sallets, Peas, Beans, RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> nay and <hi>Cardons, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. and becauÅ¿e all things grow thick and tall in thoÅ¿e fat and moiÅ¿t places, therefore he muÅ¿t plant his <hi>Kitchen-plants</hi> there, at greater diÅ¿tances one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than in drier places; he muÅ¿t alÅ¿o keep his Beds and dreÅ¿Å¿ed Grounds, raiÅ¿ed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his Walks and Path-ways, to help to drain out of his Grounds the Water that is Å¿o hurtful to his Plants, and for that ReaÅ¿on, his <hi>Beds</hi> of <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> eÅ¿pecially, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e his <hi>Strawberry</hi> and <hi>Cellery Beds,</hi> &amp;c. no more than thoÅ¿e of his Sallets muÅ¿t not be made Hollow, as thoÅ¿e muÅ¿t be that are made in drier Grounds.</p>

I have had good SucceÅ¿s in the new <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> where the Ground is fat, viÅ¿cous, and as 'twere Clayie, by raiÅ¿ing in the midÅ¿t of it, certain large Å¿quares where the frequent Rain Waters in the Summer, of the Year 1682. remained without penetrating above Å¿even or eight Inches deep, and by having given to the Å¿aid Å¿quares by the means of that elevation, a Å¿loping deÅ¿cent on each Å¿ide, all along the bottom of which I made at the Å¿ame time Å¿ome little dikes or water-courÅ¿es about a foot deep, as well to Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Å¿quares from the Counterborders as particularly to receive the miÅ¿chievous waters which by Å¿taying on the Å¿quares, otherwiÅ¿e would ruine all the Plants in them; which waters afterwards diÅ¿charged themÅ¿elves into Å¿tone gutters which I had purpoÅ¿ely ordered to be made to carry them off. I afterwards raiÅ¿ed moÅ¿t of the Counterborders in the Å¿ame manner, Arch-wiÅ¿e, that what water might remain in them might Å¿hoot off into the Å¿ides of the walks, all along which there were other little dikes almoÅ¿t unperceivable, to receive thoÅ¿e waters and convey them into the Å¿ame Å¿tone gutters-newly above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and I can truly affirm, that before I uÅ¿ed this precaution, all that I had in thoÅ¿e Å¿quares, not only of Kitchen-Plants, even to the moÅ¿t ruÅ¿tical and hardy Å¿ort of them, as <hi>Artichokes, Beet-Chards,</hi> &amp;c. but to the very <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> were viÅ¿ibly perceived to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h, the Plants with the rot, and the <hi>Trees</hi> with the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> beÅ¿ides which miÅ¿chiefs, the winds eaÅ¿ily threw up my <hi>Trees</hi> by the Roots, becauÅ¿e they could hardly take any faÅ¿t hold in that kind of Ground that were grown liquid and Å¿oft like new made mortar, or Pap. My forecaÅ¿t and diligence were a great help to me in that caÅ¿, eand I Å¿incerely adviÅ¿e all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall have to do with places of the like difficulty, to uÅ¿e the Å¿ame method, if they can find out no better expedient.</p>
                        <p>The reaÅ¿oning by which I was induced to this way of proceeding, was this: That though the exceÅ¿Å¿ive quantity of water did reduce that unhappy Å¿ort of Ground to a kind of MarÅ¿h, and thereby diÅ¿poÅ¿ed it afterwards by the operation of the great heat to grow as hard as a Å¿tone, and conÅ¿equently rendred it uncapable of culture in either of thoÅ¿e two Å¿tates wet, or dry, yet I Å¿ay, my reaÅ¿on Å¿uggeÅ¿ted to me, that if I could hinder the firÅ¿t inconvenience which was the rendring of this Ground too Liquid and MarÅ¿hy, it would be an infallible means to Å¿ecure me againÅ¿t the Å¿econd, which was to Å¿ee them grow hard and Å¿tony, becauÅ¿e I concluded, that if my Grounds having been once made light and looÅ¿e, could be kept reaÅ¿onably dry after that, as they would be if the waters were hindred from lodging in them, they would not be any more Å¿o cloÅ¿ely glued together as to grow into any Å¿uch kind of Å¿tony conÅ¿iÅ¿tence, but would become tractable like other Lands; and accordingly I found my reaÅ¿oning anÅ¿wered by the Å¿ucceÅ¿s which I expected.</p>

                        <p>IT is a very conÅ¿iderable Advance to have Å¿ettled a <hi>Garden</hi> upon a good foot at firÅ¿t and to have wiÅ¿ely employed, or at leaÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿igned out all its parts according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualifications of its Ground, the goodneÅ¿s of its ExpoÅ¿itions, the order of the Months, and the nature of each Plant; But that is not all, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e carefully cultivate them, in Å¿uch a manner as they peculiarly require.</p>
                        <p>For there is a general Culture of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> and there is a particular Culture peculiar to each Plant. As to the general Culture, it is well enough known, that the moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary and important points of it conÅ¿iÅ¿t firÅ¿t, in well amending and mucking the Earth, whether it be naturally good or not, becauÅ¿e <hi>Kitchen-Plants</hi> exhauÅ¿t it much; Å¿econdly, in keeping it always looÅ¿e and Å¿tirred, either by digging up whole <hi>Beds,</hi> to Sow or tranÅ¿plant in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Å¿uch other places where the Å¿pade may be employed, as for Example, among <hi>Artichokes, Cardons,</hi> &amp;c. or by pecking and grubbing up where the cloÅ¿eneÅ¿s of the Plants to one another, will permit us to uÅ¿e only grubbing inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as for Example, among <hi>Straw-berries, Lettuces, Endive, Peas, Beans, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, in watering plentifully all Å¿orts of Plants in very <hi>Hot</hi> weather, and eÅ¿pecially in Å¿andy Grounds, for thoÅ¿e that are Å¿trong and rank require not Å¿o much, always obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in both Å¿orts of Ground, watering is not Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary for <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> nor for borders or edgings of <hi>Time, Sage, Lavender, HiÅ¿Å¿op, Rue, Worm-wood,</hi> &amp;c. which need but little moiÅ¿ture to keep them in good plight; Fourthly, it conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in keeping the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48210:218"/>
Superficies of our Ground clear of all Å¿orts of Weeds, either by Weeding, or digging, or by only raking them over, when they have not been long dreÅ¿Å¿ed, Å¿o that as far as 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible, the Earth may always appear as if it had been newly Å¿tirred up.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿hall not inÅ¿iÅ¿t any longer here upon the head of the General Culture, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿o well known to all people, but Å¿hall only declare my Opinion and the practice of able <hi>Gard'ners</hi> in that which is peculiarly to be uÅ¿ed to each particular plant.</p>
                        <p>And I Å¿hall begin with obÅ¿erving to you, that among <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> there are Å¿ome that are Sown to remain Å¿till in the place where they were firÅ¿t, and others again, only to be tranÅ¿planted elÅ¿ewhere; that there are Å¿ome that prove well both ways; Å¿ome that are multiplied without Seed, Å¿ome that are tranÅ¿planted whole, and Å¿ome that are cut to be tranÅ¿planted; that there are Å¿ome which for the Å¿upply of Man-kind, bear Å¿everal times in a year, and that laÅ¿t longer than a year; others that produce but once in a year, but yet laÅ¿t to bear for Å¿everal years after; and LaÅ¿tly Å¿ome again, that periÅ¿h after their firÅ¿t production.</p>
                        <p>The Plants of the firÅ¿t <hi>ClaÅ¿s,</hi> are <hi>RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> almoÅ¿t all <hi>Red Beet-Roots, Carrots, ParÅ¿nips, Skirrets, Turneps, Maches, Reponces, Scorzonera's, SalÅ¿ifies,</hi> and beÅ¿ides them, <hi>Garlick, Chervil, Wild Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory, Harts-Horn Sallet, Garden-CreÅ¿Å¿es, Shallots, Spinage, Beans,</hi> Å¿mall <hi>Lettuce</hi> to cut, <hi>ParÅ¿ly, Burnet, Cutting Beets, Peas, PurÅ¿lain,</hi> &amp;c. and the greateÅ¿t part of our <hi>Sorrel, Patience</hi> or <hi>Sharp-Leav'd Dock, Onions,</hi> and <hi>Ciboulees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Plants of the Å¿econd <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> which Å¿ucceed not without being tranÅ¿planted, are <hi>Chard-Beets, Cellery,</hi> and the greateÅ¿t part of our White <hi>Endive,</hi> both long and tied, and <hi>Cabbages,</hi> unleÅ¿s they be Å¿own very thin, or be very much thinn'd after they are Å¿own; of this <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> are alÅ¿o <hi>Cabbages,</hi> moÅ¿t <hi>Musk-Melons,</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers, Citrulls</hi> or <hi>Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, Potirons</hi> or flat <hi>Pumpions, Leeks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e of the third <hi>ClaÅ¿s,</hi> that is, Å¿uch as may be indifferently either continued in the places where they are firÅ¿t Å¿own, or tranÅ¿planted elÅ¿ewhere, are <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> though moÅ¿t commonly they are Å¿own at firÅ¿t in <hi>NurÅ¿eries,</hi> to be tranÅ¿planted a year or two after; as alÅ¿o <hi>BaÅ¿il, Fennel, Anis, Borage, BugloÅ¿s, Cardons, Capucin Capers</hi> or <hi>NaÅ¿turies, Ciboulees, Savory, Time, Musked Chervil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The Plants of the fourth <hi>ClaÅ¿s</hi> that are multiplied without being Å¿own, are <hi>Alleluia,</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel,</hi> EngliÅ¿h <hi>Cives, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. BecauÅ¿e they grow into thick Tufts which are Å¿eparated into many; <hi>Artichokes</hi> are propagated by their <hi>Eyes, Off-Å¿ets,</hi> or <hi>Slips; Mint,</hi> and <hi>Round Sorrel, Tripe Madame, Tarragon, Balm,</hi> &amp;c. by their Layers or Branches that take Root where they touch the Earth, the two laÅ¿t of which have alÅ¿o the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of multiplying by Seed, as likewiÅ¿e have the <hi>Artichokes</hi> Å¿ometimes. <hi>Straw-berries</hi> propagate by their Runners, <hi>RaÅ¿p-berries, GooÅ¿e-berries,</hi> and <hi>Currans,</hi> by their <hi>Slips,</hi> or <hi>Suckers,</hi> and by their Cuttings which alÅ¿o take Root. <hi>Lavender, Worm-wood, Sage, Time,</hi> and <hi>Marjoram,</hi> by their Branches which take Root at their joints, and are alÅ¿o multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by their Seed; the common <hi>Bays,</hi> both by Layers and Seed too; <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> by their <hi>Suckers,</hi> Hooked <hi>Slips,</hi> and Cuttings whether Rooted or not Rooted.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, thoÅ¿e Plants of which we cut off Å¿ome part either of the Leaves or Roots or both at the Å¿ame time, in order to tranÅ¿plant them, are <hi>Artichokes, Chard-Beets, Leeks, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. And thoÅ¿e others whoÅ¿e Leaves we do not cut at all, though it be good always to trim their Roots a little to refreÅ¿h them, are <hi>Endive,</hi> and <hi>Succory,</hi> moÅ¿t commonly, and <hi>Savory, Sorrel,</hi> &amp;c. and all <hi>Lettuces, Alleluia</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel, Violets, BaÅ¿il, Arrach</hi> or <hi>Orage, Borage, BugloÅ¿s, Capucin Capers</hi> or <hi>NaÅ¿turces, Cabbages, Tarragon, Samphire, Straw-berries, Marjoram, Musk-Melons, Cucumbers, Citrulls</hi> or <hi>Pumpions, PurÅ¿lain;</hi> and <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> for Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Plants that bring forth Å¿everal times in a year, and yet laÅ¿t for Å¿ome years follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are <hi>Sorrel, Patience</hi> or <hi>Sharp Dock, Alleluia</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel, Burnet, Chervil, ParÅ¿ley, Fennel,</hi> all Edging, or Sweet Herbs, <hi>Wild Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory, Macedonian ParÅ¿ley</hi> or <hi>AliÅ¿anders, Mint, Tarragon, Samphire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e that produce but once in the year, but yet laÅ¿t bearing for Å¿everal years together afterwards, are <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> and <hi>Artichokes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And LaÅ¿tly, thoÅ¿e that ceaÅ¿e to be uÅ¿eful after their firÅ¿t production, are all <hi>Lettuces,</hi> Common <hi>Endive, Peas, Beans, Cardons, Melons, Cucumbers, Citrulls</hi> or <hi>Pumpions, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Leeks, Cellery, Arrach</hi> or <hi>Orage,</hi> and all Plants whoÅ¿e Roots are only in uÅ¿e, as <hi>Red Beets, Carrots,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now to give you a particular account of the Culture that belongs to every Å¿everal Å¿ort of Plant, I muÅ¿t tell you, that this Culture conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, firÅ¿t, in obÅ¿erving the diÅ¿tances they are to be placed at one from the other; Å¿econd, in the Triming of Å¿uch as need it;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48210:219"/>
third, in planting them in that Å¿ituation, and diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, which they require; fourth, in giving them thoÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tances which Å¿ome of them have need of to bring them to perfection, or which are convenient for them, whether it be by typing up, or wrapping about, or Earthing up, or otherwiÅ¿e covering them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                                 <hi>Alleluia,</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel,</hi> when it grows old, grows into Tufts, and being a Plant that grows in the Woods, and conÅ¿equently that loves the Å¿hade, we therefore plant it along by the Å¿ides of our <hi>Northern</hi> Walls, at the diÅ¿tance of about one foot between one plant and another; the more we Å¿trip it of its Leaves, which is one good quality it has, the more freÅ¿h ones it Å¿hoots forth: It is enough to Å¿et it two Inches into the Ground; it laÅ¿ts three or four years without being renewed, and to renew it, we need do no more than to Å¿eparate or Å¿lip out the great Tufts of it into Å¿everal little ones, and replant them again immediately, which is to be done in the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> a little watering in very <hi>Hot</hi> weather, and eÅ¿pecially in Å¿andy Grounds, is a very great and welcome help to them.</p>

                                 <hi>Anis</hi> and <hi>Fennel</hi> are commonly Å¿own pretty thin, either in Å¿urrows, or borders; their Leaves are uÅ¿ed in <hi>Sallets</hi> among other Furnitures.

The Leaf of this plant is very good both in pottage, and in Å¿tuffings or farces; we uÅ¿e it almoÅ¿t as Å¿oon as it peeps out of the Earth, for it paÅ¿Å¿es away very quickly; and to have Å¿ome the more early, we Å¿ow a little quantity of it upon a <hi>Hot Bed:</hi> It thrives well enough in all Å¿orts of Grounds, but yet it grows always fairer in good Grounds than in but indifferent ones.</p>

                                 <hi>Artichokes,</hi> as we have already elÅ¿ewhere told you, are multiplied by their Eyes, Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Slips, or Off-Sets, which every plant of them uÅ¿ually Å¿hoots out every year in the Spring, round about its old Root, and which muÅ¿t be taken off as Å¿oon as they are grown big enough, leaving only at each place three of the beÅ¿t and furtheÅ¿t diÅ¿tant one from the other. For the planting them, we commonly make little Trenches, or Pits about half a foot deep, and three foot diÅ¿tant one from another, and filled with Mold, and we place two rows of them regulated by a line, in each Bed, which is to be full four foot broad, and parted from the next Bed by a path-way of one full foot; theÅ¿e Trenches of Pits are to be made at about half a foots diÅ¿tance from the edge of the Bed, and ChecquerwiÅ¿e one towards the other; we place two Slips in a right Line in each Å¿pace containing between Nine and Ten Inches in Length. We muÅ¿t renew them once every three years at leaÅ¿t, cut off their Leaves at the beginning of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cover them with long dry dung during all the very cold weather till the end of <hi>March,</hi> when we muÅ¿t uncover them, and Å¿lip them, if their Slips be yet big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or elÅ¿e Å¿tay three Weeks or a Month longer till they be, then we muÅ¿t labour and move the Earth well about them, and dung them with the rotteneÅ¿t part of that Dung that Å¿erved them for a covering; we water them moderately once or twice a Week, till about the end of <hi>May,</hi> their Fruit begins to appear, and from that time we muÅ¿t wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them plentifully, that is two or three times a Week, during the whole Summer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing half a Pitcher full of Water to each plant, and eÅ¿pecially in Grounds naturally dry; thoÅ¿e planted in the Spring, Å¿hould bring their Fruit to perfection in Autumn fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, if well watered, and they which do not, ought to yield their firÅ¿t Fruit in the next Spring after, in caÅ¿e they be Å¿trong enough to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the Å¿harpneÅ¿s of the Winter. <hi>Artichokes</hi> have not only the hard weather, and exceÅ¿s of wet to fear, but they have the Field Mice likewiÅ¿e for their Enemies, thoÅ¿e miÅ¿chievous little Animals gnawing their Roots in the Winter-time, when they find nothing better in the Gardens, and for that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48210:219"/>
reaÅ¿on, it's good to plant one Rank of <hi>Beet-Chards</hi> between two Ranks of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> that the Field-Mice finding the Roots of theÅ¿e laÅ¿t the tendrer of the two, may fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them inÅ¿tead of the others, as they never fail to do. There are three Å¿orts of <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, viz.</hi> the green, or otherwiÅ¿e white ones, which are the moÅ¿t early, the violet ones, whoÅ¿e Fruit is almoÅ¿t of a pyramidal Figure, and the red ones which are round, and flat like the white ones.

                                 <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> are Å¿own at the beginning of the Spring like other Seeds, that is, they are Å¿own in Å¿ome Bed well prepared; they muÅ¿t be Å¿own indifferent thin, and raked with an Iron Rake, to cover them with Earth. About a year after, if they be big enough, as they will be, if the Ground be good, and well prepared; or if not, at leaÅ¿t at two years end, we muÅ¿t tranplant them, which is to be done about the end of <hi>March,</hi> and all the Month of <hi>April;</hi> and for that effect we muÅ¿t have Beds between three and four foot broad, and Å¿eparated one from the other; if it be in ordinary Ground, we dig theÅ¿e Beds hollow with a good Spade, throwing up the Earth we take out of them upon the Path-ways; and as to Å¿trong, heavy and moiÅ¿t Grounds, I would have them ordered as I have done the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>VerÅ¿ailles,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, I would not have the Beds in them at all laid hollow, but on the contrary, raiÅ¿ed and kept higher than the Path-ways, too much wet being mortal to theÅ¿e Plants. <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> thus Å¿own Å¿hoot out Tufts of Roots round about their Eye, or Mother Root; that is to Å¿ay, round the place from whence all their Å¿hoots are to Spring, which Roots Å¿pread between two Earths, and in order to tranÅ¿plant them either into a hollow Bed, or a high raiÅ¿ed Bed, we beÅ¿tow a good tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Tillage on the bottom of the Trench, and if the Ground be not very good, we dung it a little, and afterward we plant two or three Å¿tocks of theÅ¿e young Plants, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in ranks upon the Super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Every year we cover the Bed with a little Earth taken off from the Path-way, becauÅ¿e inÅ¿tead of Å¿inking, they always are riÅ¿ing by little and little: we dung them moderately every two years, and let them Å¿hoot up the firÅ¿t three or four years without gathering any, till we Å¿ee them begin to grow pretty thick, and then we may force as many as we pleaÅ¿e of them, or if not, we continue to gather of them every year a crop for fifteen years, before we need to renew them. Every year about <hi>Martle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> we cut down all their Å¿tems, every Å¿tock producing Å¿everal Å¿tems, and take the Å¿eed of the faireÅ¿t of them for Seed, if we would have them come to bear at the time above-mentioned. To draw them out of their <hi>NurÅ¿ery-Beds,</hi> we uÅ¿e an Iron Fork, the <hi>Spade</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too dangerous for that work, becauÅ¿e it would cut, and hurt thoÅ¿e little Plants.</p>
                              <p>We muÅ¿t not fail every Year at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> that is, before the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> begin to Å¿prout naturally, to beÅ¿tow a Å¿mall dreÅ¿Å¿ing or Å¿tirring of the Ground about three or four Inches deep, on every Bed, taking care not to let the <hi>Spade</hi> go Å¿o deep, as to hurt the Plants; which Å¿mall dreÅ¿Å¿ing Å¿erves, both to kill the Weeds and to render the Superficies of the Earth looÅ¿e, and thereby not only the better to diÅ¿poÅ¿e it to drink up the Rain, and the <hi>May-dew</hi> that nouriÅ¿hes the Stocks, but likewiÅ¿e to facilitate the paÅ¿Å¿age of the <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> in Å¿prouting. The particular and moÅ¿t dreadful Enemies of <hi>AÅ¿paragus</hi> are a Å¿ort of little Fleas, that faÅ¿ten upon their Å¿hoots, make them miÅ¿carry, and hinder them from thriving; they are moÅ¿t troubleÅ¿ome in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot and dry years, not appearing at all in other years; there has been no Remedy found yet againÅ¿t this miÅ¿chief.</p>

LaÅ¿tly, there are Å¿ome called <hi>Choux Fleurs,</hi> i. e. <hi>Cabbage Flowers,</hi> and by the EngliÅ¿h <hi>Collyflowers,</hi> which are the moÅ¿t noble and valuable of them all, and are not uÅ¿ed in pottage, but in choice intermeÅ¿Å¿es; they cannot endure the <hi>FroÅ¿t,</hi> and therefore aÅ¿Å¿oon as they begin to form their heads, they muÅ¿t be covered with their Leaves tied up for that end over them, with Straw bands, to guard them from the inÅ¿ults of the Cold that Å¿poil and rot them. They are for our <hi>Winter</hi> Å¿pending, and muÅ¿t be Å¿heltred in the <hi>Green</hi> houÅ¿e or <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory,</hi> whither they muÅ¿t be carried and there planted with a turf of their old Earth, about them, where they commonly are uÅ¿ed to perfect the full growth of their heads.

                              <p>You are by the way to remark two things; The firÅ¿t is, that all thick Plants that run to Seed, and grow pretty high, as <hi>Cabbage, Leeks, Ciboules, Onions, Red Beet-Roots, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, ParÅ¿nips, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. muÅ¿t be Å¿upported either with upright props, or cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>s Å¿ticks, to hinder the wind from breaking down their Å¿tems before the Seed be Ripe.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿econd is, that we Å¿eldom Å¿tay to let any Seeds dry upon their Plants as they Å¿tand, it being enough to let them only Ripen, when we cut down their Å¿tems, and lay them to dry upon Å¿ome Cloth, after which, we beat them out, and fan and cleanÅ¿e them and lay them up when they are fully dry: And thus we do with the Seeds of <hi>CreÅ¿Å¿es, Chervil, ParÅ¿ley, RadiÅ¿hes, Borage, BugloÅ¿s,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Ordinary <hi>Capers</hi> grow upon a Å¿ort of Å¿mall Shrub that is raiÅ¿ed in niches made purpoÅ¿ely in well expoÅ¿ed Walls, for that end, which are filled with Earth to nouriÅ¿h the Plants; and every year in the <hi>Spring</hi> we prune their Branches, which afterwards Å¿hoot out buttons or Å¿welling buds, which are pickled up in Vinegar to be uÅ¿ed in <hi>Winter,</hi> either in <hi>Sallets,</hi> or in pottage.</p>

                                 <hi>Capucine-Capers,</hi> or <hi>NaÅ¿turces,</hi> are annual Plants which are uÅ¿ually Å¿own in <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and tranÅ¿planted again in the naked Earth along by Å¿ome Walls, or at the foot of Å¿ome <hi>Trees,</hi> where their mounting Å¿talks which are but weak, and grow pretty high may take Å¿ome hold, to Å¿upport themÅ¿elves. They are alÅ¿o planted in Pots, and Boxes, in which Å¿ome Å¿ticks are Å¿et up to Å¿upport their Å¿talks. Their Buttons or round Buds before they open, are good to pickle in Vinegar. Their <hi>Flower</hi> is pretty large of an <hi>Orange Colour,</hi> and very agreeable. They muÅ¿t be carefully watered in the <hi>Summer,</hi> to make them Å¿hoot vigorouÅ¿ly, and Å¿o long time as they Å¿hould. Their Seed falls to the Earth aÅ¿Å¿oon as ever 'tis ripe, as well as that of <hi>Borage</hi> and <hi>BugloÅ¿s,</hi> and therefore muÅ¿t be carefully gathered up.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Caprons,</hi> are a Å¿ort of large <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> not over delicate, which ripen at the Å¿ame time as thoÅ¿e of the better kind. Their Leaves are extraordinary large, velveted and of a darkiÅ¿h <hi>Green Colour.</hi> They are little to be prized, and are found in the Woods as other <hi>Straw-berries</hi> are.</p>

                                 <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Cardons</hi> or <hi>Cardoons,</hi> grow only from Seed. They are Å¿own at two Å¿everal times.</p>
                              <p>The firÅ¿t is commonly about the middle, or latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the Å¿econd, at the beginning of <hi>May.</hi>

                              <p>They muÅ¿t be Å¿own in good and well prepared Ground, and in little Trenches or pits a full foot wide, and about Å¿ix Inches deep, filled with Mold. We make <hi>Beds</hi> of four or five foot wide, in order to place in them two ranks of thoÅ¿e little Trenches or pits checker-wiÅ¿e. We put five or Å¿ix Seeds in every hole, with intention to let but two or three of them grow, if they all come up, taking away thoÅ¿e that are over and above that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48210:221"/>
number, either to throw away, or to new Å¿tock thoÅ¿e places where there perhaps are none come up, or where we may have Å¿own Å¿ome few upon a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> for that intention. And if in fifteen or twenty days we do not Å¿ee the Seed come up, we Å¿hould uncover them, to Å¿ee whether they be rotten, or begin to Å¿prour, that Å¿o we may fill up their places with new ones in caÅ¿e of need. The Seeds of the firÅ¿t Å¿owing are generally three weeks coming up, and thoÅ¿e of the Å¿econd fifteen days. <hi>Cardons</hi> muÅ¿t not be Å¿own before the middle of <hi>April,</hi> for fear they Å¿hould grow too big, and run to Seed in <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and then they are not good. Great care muÅ¿t be taken to water them well; and when towards the end of <hi>October,</hi> we have a mind to whiten them, we take the advantage of Å¿ome dry day, firÅ¿t to tie up all their Leaves with two or three bands, and Å¿ome days after, we cover them quite up with Straw or dry Litter well twiÅ¿ted about them, Å¿o that the Air may not penetrate to come at them, except it be at the very top, which we leave open.</p>
                              <p>TheÅ¿e <hi>Cardoon</hi> Plants thus wrapt up, whiten in about fifteen days or three weeks, and grow fit to Eat. We make an end of tying up, and wrapping, or covering all that we have in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> when we perceive the <hi>Winter</hi> approach, and then we take them up with the Earth about them, to tranÅ¿plant them in our <hi>Green</hi> HouÅ¿e, or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervatory:</hi> Some of thoÅ¿e Plants are good to tranÅ¿plant in the naked Earth in the following <hi>Spring,</hi> to run to Seed in <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> or elÅ¿e Å¿ome Plants of them tied up in their firÅ¿t places, will Å¿erve for that three or four times together.</p>

                                 <hi>Cellery,</hi> is a Å¿ort of <hi>Sallet</hi> produced by Seed, and is not good but at the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and during the <hi>Winter</hi> SeaÅ¿on. We Å¿ow of it two Å¿everal times, to be Å¿upplied with it Å¿o much the longer, becauÅ¿e that which has been long Å¿own, eaÅ¿ily runs to Seed, and grows hard. We Å¿ow it then the firÅ¿t time upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and becauÅ¿e its Seed is Å¿o extream Å¿mall, we cannot help Å¿owing it too thick, Å¿o that if we be not careful to thin it, and crop it in time, to make it grow to Å¿ome Å¿trength and bigneÅ¿s before we tranÅ¿plant it, it warps and flags its head too much, and grows weak, and Å¿hoots its Leaves Å¿traglingly outward, inÅ¿tead of producing Å¿tore of them from the middle of its Å¿tock. The Å¿ureÅ¿t way is to tranÅ¿plant it in a <hi>NurÅ¿ery Bed,</hi> placing the Plants two or three Inches one from another, for which we make holes with our fingers only; we tranÅ¿plant that which comes of the firÅ¿t Å¿owing at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> and Å¿ow our Å¿econd Å¿owing, at the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June,</hi> but 'tis in open <hi>Beds,</hi> and we take the Å¿ame care to thin, crop, and tranÅ¿plant this, as we did that of the firÅ¿t Å¿owing, but we muÅ¿t plant more of it the Å¿econd time, than at the firÅ¿t. There are two ways of tranÅ¿planting it; the one is in a Pit or Trench one full Å¿pit deep, and between three and four foot broad, in order to place in it three or four ranks of theÅ¿e Plants at the diÅ¿tance of one foot from one another: This way of making hollow <hi>Beds</hi> Earth up our <hi>Cellery</hi> in, is good only in dry Grounds, wet ones being too apt to rot, it. The Å¿econd way of tranÅ¿planting it, is in plain <hi>Beds</hi> that are not made hollow, and at the Å¿ame diÅ¿tances as in the other, taking care in both Å¿orts of <hi>Beds</hi> to water them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in <hi>Summer</hi> time, its chief goodneÅ¿s conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in being tender, as well as in being very <hi>White.</hi> Watering contributes to the firÅ¿t kind of goodneÅ¿s, and for the Å¿econd, you are to obÅ¿erve, that to <hi>Whiten Cellery,</hi> we begin at firÅ¿t to tie it with two bands when it is big enough, chuÅ¿ing dry weather for that effect, and afterward we Earth our <hi>Cellery</hi> Plants quite up, with Earth taken off the high raiÅ¿ed path-ways, or elÅ¿e cover it all over with a good quantity of long dry Dung, or dry Leaves, as we do <hi>Cardoons. Cellery</hi> Å¿o Earthed up with dry Earth, or Clothed with long dry Dung, or dry Leaves, to the very top of its Leaves, <hi>Whitens</hi> in three weeks or a Month, and becauÅ¿e when 'tis <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> it rots as it Å¿tands, if it be not preÅ¿ently eaten, by conÅ¿equence, we are not to Earth it up, or cover it with Dung, but in Å¿uch proportion as we are able to Å¿pend out of hand; there needs no other precaution to be uÅ¿ed to it Å¿o long as it does not freeze; but as Å¿oon as ever it begins to Å¿et to freeze, we muÅ¿t then cover up our <hi>Cellery</hi> quite over head and ears, for a hard <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> Å¿poils it preÅ¿ently. And that we may the more eaÅ¿ily cover it, after we have firÅ¿t tied it up with two or three bands, we take it up with the Earth about it, at the beginning of <hi>Winter,</hi> and plant it in another <hi>Bed,</hi> Å¿etting the Plants as cloÅ¿e as we can one to another, and then there needs much leÅ¿s Å¿tuff to cover them, than when they are left Å¿tanding in their old places at Å¿uch great diÅ¿tances aÅ¿under. The way to raiÅ¿e Seed from them, is, to tranÅ¿plant Å¿ome Plants of them in Å¿ome by-place, after <hi>Winter</hi> is paÅ¿t, which will not fail to run to Seed in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> we know but one Å¿ort of it.</p>

                                 <hi>Chard-Beets</hi> are Plants of white <hi>Beets</hi> tranÅ¿planted in a well prepared Bed, at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of a full foot one from the other, which produce great Tops, that in the middle have a large white, and thick downy Cotton-like Main Å¿hoot, and that downy Cotton-like Å¿hoot is the true <hi>Chard</hi> uÅ¿ed in Pottages and IntermeÅ¿Å¿es. After we have Å¿own white <hi>Beets</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> or in the naked Earth, in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> we tranÅ¿plant that which is yelloweÅ¿t in <hi>Beds</hi> purpoÅ¿ely prepared, and by taking care to water them well during the Summer, they grow big and Å¿trong enough to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the hard winter cold, provided care be taken to cover them with long dry Dung, juÅ¿t as we do <hi>Artichokes.</hi> They are likewiÅ¿e well placed, when two Ranks of them are tranÅ¿planted between two Ranks of <hi>Artichokes.</hi> We uncover them in <hi>April,</hi> and dreÅ¿s the Earth about them, and give them careful attendance, and by the means of this diligent Culture, they produce thoÅ¿e fine <hi>Chards</hi> we have in the <hi>Rogation</hi> SeaÅ¿on, and in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> in fine, they run to Seed, which we gather in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> to Å¿ow in the following Spring.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿ela's</hi> is a very good and Å¿weet Å¿ort of Grape, of which there are two kinds, white and Red, and this latter is very Å¿carce and rare, but the other very common. It requires the good ExpoÅ¿itions of the <hi>South, EaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> to be Å¿o much the yellower, the more firm and crackling, the better; It is of all Grapes that which keeps lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿t, if it be not Å¿uffered to grow too ripe upon the Vine before it be gathered. Its Culture which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in pruning it, is the Å¿ame with that of the <hi>Bourdelais</hi> or Verjuice Grape.</p>
                              <p>Musked <hi>Chervil</hi> is one of our Sallet-Furnitures, and at the beginning of the Spring, whilÅ¿t its Leaves are young and tender, it is agreeable, and proper to contribute towards the giving a perfuming ReliÅ¿h, but they are to be uÅ¿ed no longer when they are old and tough.

                              <p>Ordinary <hi>Chervil</hi> is an annual Plant, or rather a plant of few Months, which Å¿erves for many UÅ¿es, and eÅ¿pecially in Sallets, when it is young and tender, and therefore we ought to Å¿ee a little of it every Month proportionably to the occaÅ¿ions we have for it, and to the quantity of Ground we have. It runs very eaÅ¿ily to Seed, and if we have Å¿ome of it betimes, we muÅ¿t Å¿ow it about the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and doubtleÅ¿s we Å¿hall have the Seed quite ripe towards the middle of <hi>June</hi> following; we cut down the Å¿talks as Å¿oon as it begins to grow yellow, and beat it out as we do that of other Plants.</p>

We thin our <hi>Cibouls</hi> alÅ¿o for the Å¿ame, and we tranÅ¿plant Å¿ome which proÅ¿per very well, and grow big when they are Å¿o tranÅ¿planted.

                                 <hi>ENdive</hi> is a Å¿ort of very good annual Plant uÅ¿ed in <hi>Sallets,</hi> and in our pottage in the <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> SeaÅ¿ons, provided it be well whitened, and conÅ¿equently tender and delicate; it is multiplied only by Seed. There is the Common or <hi>Garden Endive,</hi> and wild <hi>Endive,</hi> called alÅ¿o <hi>Succory,</hi> the common name in <hi>French</hi> to them both. The Common <hi>Endive</hi> is of Å¿everal kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>White,</hi> which is the moÅ¿t delicate, and the <hi>Green</hi> Å¿ort which is the moÅ¿t ruÅ¿tical, and beÅ¿t able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the <hi>Cold,</hi> as likewiÅ¿e the Curled Å¿ort, and that which is not Curled.</p>
                              <p>All Å¿orts of them agree tolerably well with all kinds of Ground. We Å¿eldom begin to Å¿ow any of them till towards the middle of <hi>May,</hi> and then they muÅ¿t be Å¿own very thin, or be very much thinned, aftewards in order to be whitened in the places where they firÅ¿t grow, without tranÅ¿planting, and we alÅ¿o Å¿ow but a little quantity of them at once, becauÅ¿e they are too apt to run to Seed: The Å¿eaÅ¿on for Å¿owing a greater quantity of them is at the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> and during the whole Month of <hi>July,</hi> in order to have Å¿ome good for Å¿pending in <hi>September,</hi> and we afterwards Å¿ow a great deal of it again in <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> that we may have a Å¿ufficient proviÅ¿ion of it to Å¿upply us all the reÅ¿t of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and the firÅ¿t part of the <hi>Winter.</hi> When our <hi>Endive</hi> comes up too thick, we cut it, or elÅ¿e pull up Å¿ome of it, to thin it, that the reÅ¿t may grow big enough to be tranÅ¿planted; and when we tranÅ¿plant any of it in <hi>Summer</hi> time, it muÅ¿t be placed at the diÅ¿tance of a large foot between Plant and Plant; we uÅ¿ually make great <hi>Beds</hi> of five or Å¿ix foot broad, in order to tranÅ¿plant them afterwards in rows markt out Å¿trait with a cord. This Plant requires great and frequent waterings; and when 'tis big enough we muÅ¿t go to work to whiten it, for which effect, we tie it up with two or three bands according as its height requires; and being Å¿o tied, it whitens in fifteen, or twenty days: But becauÅ¿e it is very apprehenÅ¿ive of the <hi>FroÅ¿t,</hi> therefore aÅ¿Å¿oon as ever the <hi>Cold</hi> begins to come on, we cover it with long dry Dung, whether it be tied up or no: At the end of <hi>September,</hi> we plant the Å¿tocks of it pretty near together becauÅ¿e then it grows neither Å¿o high, nor Å¿preads Å¿o much as in <hi>Summer:</hi> And if we can Å¿ave any Plants of it in <hi>Winter,</hi> we muÅ¿t tranÅ¿plant them again in the <hi>Spring</hi> in order to produce Seed that may have Å¿ufficient time to ripen. ThoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons that have a good <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory</hi> or <hi>Green</hi> houÅ¿e, will do well to houÅ¿e it up there, but they which have none muÅ¿t be content to cover it up well with a good quantity of long dry Dung, Å¿o that the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> may not come at it.</p>
                              <p>Wild <hi>Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory</hi> is Å¿own at the very beginning of the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and that pretty thick, and in Ground well prepared. We endeavour to fortifie it, and make it grow big all <hi>Summer,</hi> by watering, and cropping it that it may be fit to whiten in <hi>Winter.</hi>

                              <p>There are Å¿ome People that will eat it <hi>Green</hi> in <hi>Sallets</hi> though it be never Å¿o bitter, but commonly they rather deÅ¿ire it whitened: And to whiten it, we cover it up with a great deal of long Dung, after we have firÅ¿t cut it cloÅ¿e to the Earth, by which means, it been forced to Å¿pring up in obÅ¿curity, and Å¿haded from all light, its young Å¿hoots grow <hi>White</hi> and tender. The neateÅ¿t way is by the interpoÅ¿ition of Å¿ome props croÅ¿Å¿ing from Å¿ide to Å¿ide, to keep the Dung from touching it, Å¿ince it Å¿hoots up in the Å¿ame manner under Å¿uch a hollow covering as under a cloÅ¿e one, Å¿o that care be taken, Å¿o well to Å¿top up paÅ¿Å¿ages on all Å¿ides, that no light or Air at all get in. Being thus ordered, its Å¿hoots are much cleanlier, and reliÅ¿h not Å¿o much of the Dung. They which have <hi>ConÅ¿ervatories</hi> may tranÅ¿plant Å¿ome of it thither in <hi>Winter,</hi> it Å¿prouting well enough there, when it is but a little obÅ¿curely placed. When it is <hi>Green</hi> it endures the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> well enough, and at the very latter end of <hi>May,</hi> it runs to Seed. Many People eat its young Å¿hoots in <hi>Sallets</hi> when they are young and tender.</p>

We have many things; for in the firÅ¿t place, there are <hi>Lettuces</hi> of different SeaÅ¿ons, thoÅ¿e which are good in certain Months in the year being not good in others; and thoÅ¿e which grow well in the <hi>Spring,</hi> thriving not well in <hi>Summer;</hi> and they which proÅ¿per in <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> coming tonothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Spring</hi> nor <hi>Summer,</hi> as will be Å¿een afterwards: In the Å¿econd place, there are Å¿ome that with the ordinary help of the general culture attain their due perfection, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute both to the nouriÅ¿hment and pleaÅ¿ure of Man-kind, and they are the <hi>Cabbage Lettuces.</hi>
                                 <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48210:223"/>
Thirdly, there are Å¿ome that neceÅ¿Å¿arily require the Art of InduÅ¿try and the Gard'ner to advance them to that degree of perfection which they Å¿hould have; and they are Å¿uch as muÅ¿t be tied up to make them grow white, without which they would be neither tender, nor Å¿weet, nor good; Å¿uch as are the <hi>Roman Lettuces,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, and I have thought fit Å¿ometimes to tie up thoÅ¿e that were to cabbage, when I Å¿aw they did not cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage Å¿oon enough, by which means they may be forced to cabbage whether they will or no. I uÅ¿e this Method particularly with Å¿ome Å¿orts of <hi>Winter Lettuces,</hi> that is, when there are any of them which though furniÅ¿hed with leaves big enough to cabbage, yet for want of Å¿ufficient heat, are hindred from turning, that is from growing hard; and this expedient is a very Å¿overaign Remedy againÅ¿t that Defect, in a Å¿urly SeaÅ¿on; and beÅ¿ides theÅ¿e general diÅ¿tinctions, the number of the particular Kinds of <hi>Lettuces</hi> is greater than of any other Å¿ort of <hi>Kitchen-plants</hi> whatÅ¿oever, as will appear more eÅ¿pecially by the order they obÅ¿erve in reÅ¿pect of the SeaÅ¿ons; and the order of the <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> as near as I can deÅ¿cribe it, is this.</p>
                              <p>The firÅ¿t that cabbage at the going out of Winter, are the <hi>Shell Lettuces</hi> Å¿o call'd, becauÅ¿e their Leaf is round almoÅ¿t like a Shell. They are otherwiÅ¿e called <hi>Winter-Lettu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> becauÅ¿e they pretty well indure ordinary FroÅ¿ts, which none of all the other <hi>Lettu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> can do. TheÅ¿e are Å¿own in <hi>September,</hi> and afterward tranÅ¿planted in Å¿ome <hi>Wall-Border</hi> towards the South and EaÅ¿t, in the Months of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> or elÅ¿e they are Å¿own upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and are good to eat in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May.</hi> We have at the Å¿ame time another Å¿ort of <hi>ReddiÅ¿h Lettuces</hi> called <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿ion Lettuces,</hi> which proÅ¿per very well in light Grounds, but not over well in others that being colder and Å¿tronger or heavier, eaÅ¿ily infect them with Å¿limy Snivel. Both theÅ¿e kinds Å¿hould when they thrive, produce very thick and good Heads. To theÅ¿e Å¿ucceed the Bright curled <hi>Lettuces,</hi> which uÅ¿ually cabbage in the Spring, that is before the heat grows any thing exceÅ¿Å¿ive, but they muÅ¿t not be planted in Å¿trong and heavy Lands. They likewiÅ¿e do well enough upon a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially under <hi>GlaÅ¿s Bells</hi> or <hi>Frames;</hi> for when they are Å¿own in <hi>January,</hi> and tranÅ¿planted as Å¿oon as they are grown any thing thick, or elÅ¿e left thin upon their <hi>NurÅ¿ery-Beds,</hi> they cabbage as Å¿oon as the <hi>Winter-Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces,</hi> and are very excellent.</p>
                              <p>There is about the Å¿ame SeaÅ¿on, two other Å¿orts of <hi>Curled Bright Lettuces;</hi> viz. one called <hi>George Lettuces,</hi> which are thicker and leÅ¿s curled than the ordinary <hi>Curled Bright Lettuces;</hi> and another called the <hi>Minion Lettuce,</hi> which is the leaÅ¿t Å¿ort. Both theÅ¿e laÅ¿t require Å¿uch Ground as we term good black Sand, but yet their Heads Å¿eldom cabbage cloÅ¿e enough, that is to Å¿ay, are not ordinarily Å¿o hard and firm as thoÅ¿e of the right <hi>Curled Bright Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Curled Green Lettuces</hi> come in near about the Å¿ame SeaÅ¿on with the preceeding ones, but are not Å¿o tender nor delicate.</p>
                              <p>There is alÅ¿o a Å¿ort of Å¿mall red ones, and another named <hi>Short Lettuces,</hi> both which have all the neceÅ¿Å¿ary qualifications of good <hi>Lettuces,</hi> excepting only that their Heads are Å¿mall, and that they likewiÅ¿e require Black Sandy Ground.</p>
                              <p>The firÅ¿t <hi>Lettuces</hi> Å¿upply us amply as I have Å¿aid, during the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> but after that time they are too apt to be influenced to run to Seed by the great heat that then comes on. They are followed during the reÅ¿t of <hi>June,</hi> and all the Month of <hi>July,</hi> by thoÅ¿e called the <hi>Royal Bellegardes,</hi> or <hi>Fair Looks, Bright Genua's, Capucins, Aubervilliers,</hi> and <hi>Perpignans;</hi> of which laÅ¿t, there are both green and bright, both of which produce very fair and very good heads, and thrive well enough in Å¿trong Grounds too, when the Summer proves not too Rainy; but cold, or too frequent Rains infect them with Slime and Snivel, and conÅ¿equently deÅ¿troy them. The <hi>Capucin Lettuces</hi> are reddiÅ¿h, cabbage eaÅ¿ily, even without tranÅ¿planting, and are pretty delicate. The <hi>Aubervilliers</hi> bring forth Heads that are too hard, and Å¿ometimes bitter withall, and are more uÅ¿ed for boiling than for Sallets. The difference that appears between the <hi>Royal</hi> and the <hi>Bellegardes</hi> or <hi>Fair look'd Lettuces,</hi> is only, that the former are a little more GreeniÅ¿h, and theÅ¿e laÅ¿t a little Brighter.</p>
                              <p>However in the Summer time, the tied <hi>Lettuces</hi> are mixed among the cabbaged ones, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman Lettuces</hi> which are open, and are called <hi>Chicons,</hi> or <hi>Bright,</hi> and are termed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanges,</hi> which laÅ¿t are more delicate than the <hi>Chicons,</hi> both to raiÅ¿e, and when they are eaten in <hi>Sallets.</hi> There are alÅ¿o a Å¿ort which are Å¿tiled <hi>Imperial Lettuces,</hi> which are of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great Size, and are likewiÅ¿e very delicate to the taÅ¿te, but very apt to rot as Å¿oon as ever they grow white; there are beÅ¿ides, a certain kind of large <hi>ReddiÅ¿h Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                                    <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                                    </gap>s,</hi> which whiten in a manner of themÅ¿elves without tying, and are good in courÅ¿e Grounds, and Å¿ucceed uÅ¿ually pretty well in Summer, for as for the green <hi>Chicons,</hi> we
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48210:224"/>
cannot well have them but in the Spring, becauÅ¿e they run too haÅ¿tily to Seed. The <hi>Lettuces</hi> that defend themÅ¿elves beÅ¿t from the great heat that predominates about the end of <hi>July,</hi> and all the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> are thoÅ¿e we call <hi>Genua Lettuces,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the green Å¿ort, for the <hi>Bright Genua,</hi> and <hi>Red Genua</hi> run more eaÅ¿ily to Seed, and will hardly come to good but in light Grounds. We Å¿hould therefore prepare a great many of theÅ¿e green <hi>Genua's</hi> againÅ¿t the Dog-days, and the firÅ¿t FroÅ¿ts; we may alÅ¿o intermix with them Å¿ome few <hi>Bright,</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Red Genua's;</hi> but more eÅ¿pecially we Å¿hould be Å¿ure to mix with them Å¿ome <hi>Alfanges,</hi> and a great quantity of bright or white <hi>Endive,</hi> as likewiÅ¿e, a great many <hi>Perpignan Lettuces,</hi> both of the bright and green kind. The great Inconveniencies that happen to <hi>Cabbage Lettuces,</hi> are firÅ¿t, that they often degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Å¿o far as to cabbage no more, which is diÅ¿covered by their Leaves growing out in length like a Cat's Tongue, as Gard'ners term it, or by their changing their natural colour into another more or leÅ¿s green; and therefore we muÅ¿t be very careful to gather no Seed from any but Å¿uch as cabbage very well, for which effect, we Å¿hould be Å¿ure to mark out at firÅ¿t, Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e that turn beÅ¿t, in order to reÅ¿erve them to run to Seed where they Å¿tand, or to remove them with a turf of the Earth about them into Å¿ome Å¿eparate place aÅ¿Å¿igned for that purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿econd is, that as Å¿oon as the moÅ¿t part of them are cabbaged, they muÅ¿t be Å¿pent, unleÅ¿s we would have the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure to Å¿ee them run to Seed without doing us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Service; in which ReÅ¿pect the Market Gard'ners have a great advantage beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther PerÅ¿ons, becauÅ¿e they can Å¿ell off in one day, whole Beds of theÅ¿e <hi>Cabbage Lettuces,</hi> for commonly the Beds which were new planted at the Å¿ame time, <hi>Cabbage</hi> likewiÅ¿e all at once, whereas in other Gardens, we cannot Å¿pend them any faÅ¿ter than we need them, for which ReaÅ¿on we are obliged to plant often of them, and that in greater quantity than we are able to conÅ¿ume, that we may have a continual Å¿upply of them Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively, without any DiÅ¿continuation, it being much more commodious to have an over-plus quantity of them, than to want. The Å¿ureÅ¿t way is to keep particularly to thoÅ¿e Å¿orts that are the moÅ¿t RuÅ¿tical, and that laÅ¿t a great while cabbaged before they run to Seed, Å¿uch as are the <hi>Shell Lettuces,</hi> the <hi>Perpignans,</hi> the <hi>Green Genua's,</hi> the <hi>Aubervilliers,</hi> and the <hi>AuÅ¿trichettes,</hi> or <hi>AuÅ¿trian Lettuces,</hi> which I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s too, are a long time cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baging.</p>
                              <p>The third inconvenience is, that the <hi>Morie,</hi> that is, the Rot which begins at the ends of their Leaves, Å¿eizes them Å¿ometimes, and that when the Ground or the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on are not favourable to them, they remain thin and lean, and run up to Seed inÅ¿tead of Å¿preading and cabbaging. There is hardly any Remedy to prevent this Rot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e there is hardly any to be found effectual againÅ¿t the cold and rainy SeaÅ¿ons that cauÅ¿e it; but againÅ¿t the defects that may be in the Ground, there are infallible ones, that is to Å¿ay, it muÅ¿t be amended and improved with Å¿mall Dung, if it be barren, whether it be a Å¿andy, or a <hi>Cold</hi> and groÅ¿s Earth; and to this laÅ¿t, we Å¿hould give a little Å¿lope, if when the Ground is good, the waters Å¿poil it by Å¿ettling too much in it, and by that means, make all the Plants growing there to rot. Good Dung throughly rotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul and <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> without which, no more than without frequent waterings, and dreÅ¿Å¿ing of the Ground no man can ever be rich in fine and goodly <hi>Legumes.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>There yet remains to be known for the perfect underÅ¿tanding the ordering of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces,</hi> that they which grow biggeÅ¿t muÅ¿t be placed ten or twelve inches one from the other, which is to be underÅ¿tood of the <hi>Shell Lettuces, Perpignans, AuÅ¿trians, Bellegardes,</hi> or <hi>Fair-looks, Aubervilliers, Alfanges,</hi> and <hi>Imperials;</hi> and for thoÅ¿e that bear heads but of a midling Å¿ize, the diÅ¿tance of Å¿even or eight inches is enough, which are the Bright Curled, the Å¿hort, the little <hi>Red,</hi> and the <hi>Green Chicon Lettuces,</hi> &amp;c. ThoÅ¿e that will be good husbands may Å¿ow <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> in their <hi>Lettuce Beds,</hi> becauÅ¿e the <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> will be all drawn out and Å¿pent before the <hi>Lettuces</hi> cabbage; and for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e the <hi>Endives</hi> are much longer before they come to perfection than the <hi>Lettuces,</hi> we may Plant Å¿ome of theÅ¿e laÅ¿t among the <hi>Endives;</hi> they agree well enough one with the other: and Å¿o we may have a double crop to gather upon one and the Å¿ame <hi>Bed</hi> and in the Å¿ame SeaÅ¿on; for the <hi>Lettuces</hi> are gathered firÅ¿t, and afterwards the <hi>Endives</hi> arrive to their full good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s.</p>

They muÅ¿t be Å¿own thin, that they may have room to grow to their full bigneÅ¿s, and therefore if they come up too thick, they muÅ¿t be thinned by pulling Å¿ome of them up as Å¿oon as they are big enough for that, which is towards the Month of <hi>May,</hi> which we tranÅ¿plant in order to uÅ¿e inÅ¿tead of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouls.</hi> Though the ordinary SeaÅ¿on for Å¿owing <hi>Onions,</hi> be at the end of Winter, yet we

We muÅ¿t not forget when our <hi>Onions</hi> begin to appear with pretty thick Stems above the Superficies of the Earth, that is, when they begin to advance towards their Maturity, to break them down, either by treading them under our Feet, or with a board pretty hard preÅ¿Å¿ed down upon them, becauÅ¿e by that means the nouriÅ¿hment that was before Å¿pent in their Å¿tems, being hindered from mounting upwards, will remain and Å¿ettle all in that which I think, is but improperly called their head, and make it grow Å¿o much the bigger.

                                 <hi>Macedonian ParÅ¿ley,</hi> or <hi>AliÅ¿anders,</hi> is one of the Furnitures of our <hi>Winter-Sallets,</hi> which muÅ¿t be whitened like <hi>Wild Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, at the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> we muÅ¿t cut down all its Leaves, and then cover the Bed where it grows, all over with long dry Dung, or Straw Screens, Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that the FroÅ¿t may not come at it, by which means, the new Leaves that Å¿pring from it, grow white, yellowiÅ¿h and tender. We Å¿ow it in the Spring, pretty thin, becauÅ¿e it produces a great many large Leaves, and we gather its Seed at the latter end of Summer. It is a good hardy Plant, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends its Å¿elf very well from the Drought, without requiring much watering.</p>

                                 <hi>ParÅ¿nips</hi> are a Å¿ort of Roots well known in our <hi>Kitchens.</hi> We Å¿ow them towards the end of <hi>Winter,</hi> either in open Ground, or Borders, and that always pretty thin, and in good and well prepared Ground; and if they come up too thick, they muÅ¿t be thinned as Å¿oon as <hi>May</hi> comes in, that they which are left, may be the better nouriÅ¿ht, and grow the fairer. They are propagated only by Seed, for the raiÅ¿ing which, the Å¿ame care is to be taken as we have directed for that of <hi>Red Beet-roots, Carrots,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But when they are propt, they yield more than when they are not. They require pretty good Ground, and a little Rain to make them tender and delicate, and muÅ¿t be Å¿own pretty thin. There are Å¿everal Å¿orts of them, <hi>viz. HaÅ¿tings, Green, White</hi> and <hi>Square ones,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e called large codded <hi>Peas,</hi> &amp;c. We may have of them in the Months of <hi>May, June, July, AuguÅ¿t, September</hi> and <hi>October.</hi> For to have Å¿ome all that while after the firÅ¿t, we have no more to do, but to Å¿ow them in different Months, to have them fit for eating three Months after. ThoÅ¿e Å¿orts we are moÅ¿t choice of in <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> are the <hi>HaÅ¿tings</hi> both White and Green, which are of a midling Size.

                                 <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> is one of the prettieÅ¿t Plants in a <hi>Kitchen-gardens,</hi> which is principally uÅ¿ed in <hi>Sallets,</hi> and Å¿ometimes in <hi>Pottages.</hi> There are two Å¿orts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Green,</hi> and the <hi>Red,</hi> or <hi>Golden;</hi> this latter is the more agreeable of the two to the Eye, and more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and difficult to rear, Å¿o that in hard weather we have much ado to make it grow even upon hot Beds, and under Bells, for it Å¿eldom proÅ¿pers in open Beds till about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> and then too, the Earth muÅ¿t be very good, Å¿weet, and very looÅ¿e, and the weather very fair. And therefore for our firÅ¿t <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> which we are not to begin to Å¿ow upon hot Beds till towards the Middle of <hi>March,</hi> we muÅ¿t uÅ¿e only the Green Å¿ort, becauÅ¿e the Yellow or Golden Å¿ort dwindles away as Å¿oon as 'tis come up, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s the SeaÅ¿on be a little advanced, and the Sun a little hot, which is, towards the end of <hi>April.</hi> It is commonly Å¿own very thick, becauÅ¿e its Seed is Å¿o very Å¿mall, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Å¿own thin. When we Å¿ow it upon hot Beds, either when 'tis cold, and that by conÅ¿equence GlaÅ¿s-bells or Frames are needfull, or in milder Weather, we only preÅ¿s down the Mold about it with our hands, or with the back of a Spade; but when we Å¿ow it in open Beds which muÅ¿t be well prepared for that purpoÅ¿e, we rake it over five or Å¿ix times with an Iron Rake, to make the Seed enter into the Ground.</p>
                              <p>They way to raiÅ¿e Seed from it, is to tranÅ¿plant Å¿ome Plants of it that are big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, into Beds well prepared, at the diÅ¿tance of eight or ten inches ones from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> are proper for that effect. And then in a little time after, they are run up, and have done flowring, aÅ¿Å¿oon as ever we perceive any of their Husks to open, and diÅ¿cover Å¿ome black Seed, we muÅ¿t cut down all their Stems and lay them Å¿ome days in the Sun till all the Seed be quite ripened, and then we beat them out and winnow them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muÅ¿t be carefull to tranÅ¿plant each Å¿ort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by it Å¿elf, that we may not be miÅ¿taken in the Seed when we are to Å¿ow it. The Stick Stalks of <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> that is run to Seed, are good to pickle in Salt and Vinegar, for Winter Sallets.</p>

                                 <hi>RAdiÅ¿hes,</hi> when they are qualified with all the goodneÅ¿s they Å¿hould have, that is, when they are tender, and Å¿nap eaÅ¿ily, and are Å¿weet, are in my Opinion, one of the Plants that give the moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ure of any in our <hi>Kitchin-gardens,</hi> and that give it as often, and for as long a time as any of them all; and I look upon them as a kind of <hi>Manna</hi> in our Gardens. There Å¿eems to be no great pains required to make them grow, it being indeed only neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿ow them pretty thin, in well prepared looÅ¿e and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Earth, and to water them Å¿oundly in drie Weather, and with this culture they will attain to all the perfection they are capable of. But the main points here in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion, are firÅ¿t, to be always provided with Seed of a good kind; and Å¿econdly, to take order to have <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> without diÅ¿continuation, from the Month of <hi>February,</hi> till the coming in of the FroÅ¿ts in the middle of <hi>November.</hi> As for Seed of a good kind, know, that is it that produces few Leaves, and a long red Root, for there are Å¿ome that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a great many leaves and little Root; and when we are once provided with Seed of a good kind, we muÅ¿t be extreme carefull to propagate it, that we never be without a Å¿tock of it; for which effect, in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> we muÅ¿t chooÅ¿e out among thoÅ¿e <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> that are come of the laÅ¿t years Seed, Å¿uch, as I have Å¿aid, which have the feweÅ¿t Leaves and the moÅ¿t Root, and reddeÅ¿t Necks, and tranÅ¿plant them quite whole in Å¿ome well prepared Å¿pot of Ground, a foot and a half a Å¿under: Being Å¿o tranÅ¿planted, they will run up, flower and yield Seed ripe enough to gather towards the end of <hi>July;</hi> and then we cut down their Å¿tems; and after they have been dried Å¿ome days in the Sun, we beat out the Seed, and winnow it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>ThoÅ¿e Å¿tocks of them that run up to Seed, Å¿hoot up their Branches to Å¿uch a height, and perpetuate their flowers Å¿o far as if they knew not where to Å¿top; and therefore it is good to pinch off theÅ¿e Branches to a reaÅ¿onable length, that the firÅ¿t Podds may be the better nouriÅ¿hed.</p>
                              <p>But 'tis not enough to raiÅ¿e good Seed, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e take order to be Å¿upplied with good <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> for eight or nine Months in the year.

March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> otherwiÅ¿e we have none; and in order to have Å¿ome all the other Months, we muÅ¿t Å¿ow Å¿ome among all manner of Seeds, they coming up Å¿o very quickly, that we have time to gather off our <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> before they can do any harm to the other Plants. <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> are extreamly apprehenÅ¿ive of the exceÅ¿Å¿ive heat in <hi>Summer,</hi> which makes them grow Å¿trong as they term it, that is, too biting, Å¿tringy, and Å¿ometimes very hard; and therefore in that SeaÅ¿on we would affect to Å¿ow them in very looÅ¿e Mellow Ground, where the Sun Å¿hines but little; and the beÅ¿t way Å¿hould be, to make up along by the Å¿ides of Å¿ome <hi>Northern</hi> Walls, a <hi>Bed</hi> or two for that purpoÅ¿e, filled with mold to the depth of a large foot and an half, and to Å¿ow our <hi>RadiÅ¿hes</hi> there, and water them well.

                                 <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> as well the <hi>White</hi> as the <hi>Red,</hi> multiply and perpetuate themÅ¿elves by running Suckers that Å¿pringing out of their old Å¿tocks, take Root. It is obÅ¿erved, that a new plantation of them taken out of the Woods, turns to better account when tranÅ¿plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than one Å¿lipt of from the <hi>Garden Straw-berries.</hi> We plant them either in <hi>Beds</hi> or borders, both which muÅ¿t be well prepared, amended and laboured or Å¿tirred up in one manner or other. If it be in dry and Å¿andy Ground, both the <hi>Beds</hi> and borders muÅ¿t be Å¿unk a little lower than the Allies or path-ways, the better to retain both the rain that falls, and the water we beÅ¿tow on them; a quite contrary courÅ¿e muÅ¿t be taken, if we plant them in Å¿trong, heavy, and fat Earth, and that is almoÅ¿t all pure Clay, becauÅ¿e exceÅ¿Å¿ive moiÅ¿ture rots the Plants. We place them uÅ¿ually nine or ten Inches aÅ¿under, putting two or three little Plants into each hole which we make with a planting Å¿tick. The beÅ¿t time to plant them in is during the whole Month of <hi>May,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, before the great heat comes in. And we may plant them all <hi>Summer</hi> long in rainy SeaÅ¿ons. It is particularly requiÅ¿ite to plant <hi>NurÅ¿eries</hi> of them in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and that in Å¿ome place near the <hi>North</hi> Quarter, the better to Å¿helter them from the violent heat of the <hi>Summer</hi> Sun, and then we plant them but three or four Inches one from the other, and when they are grown big enough there, we tranÅ¿plant them afterwards in the Month of <hi>September</hi> in order to make <hi>Beds</hi> or Å¿quares of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we find occaÅ¿ion to have a greater or leÅ¿s abundance of them. Their culture conÅ¿iÅ¿ts chiefly, firÅ¿t, in watering them well in dry SeaÅ¿ons; Å¿econdly in leaving, but a moderate number of Å¿tems or upright Å¿hoots to every Å¿tock, three or four of the moÅ¿t vigourous being enough; in the third place, in leaving but three or four <hi>Straw-berries</hi> of

them that appeared firÅ¿t, and neareÅ¿t the Å¿tock, on every Å¿tem, and therefore we muÅ¿t pinch of all their other BloÅ¿Å¿oms that almoÅ¿t endleÅ¿sly grow out at the ends of thoÅ¿e that have already BloÅ¿Å¿omed, or are Å¿till in BloÅ¿Å¿om, becauÅ¿e none but the firÅ¿t produce any fair <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> hardly any of the laÅ¿t being ever known to knit or come to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but when we are careful to pinch them off judicially we may be aÅ¿Å¿ured always to have good <hi>Straw-berries.</hi> I have already given directions in the works of the Month of <hi>February,</hi> how to raiÅ¿e <hi>HaÅ¿ting Straw-berries.</hi> Curious PerÅ¿ons have uÅ¿ually two <hi>Straw-barries</hi> of two Å¿everal <hi>Colours,</hi> viz. <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> but they place them in Å¿eparate <hi>Beds.</hi> The great Enemies of <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plantations are the <hi>Ton's</hi> which are great <hi>White</hi> Worms, that in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> gnaw the necks of their Roots between two Earths, and Å¿o kill them; to prevent which, in thoÅ¿e Months we Å¿hould carefully Å¿earch every day, under the Roots of all our <hi>Straw-berries</hi> that begin to wither, where we Å¿hall commonly find one of theÅ¿e great Worms which after they have done a miÅ¿chief to one, paÅ¿s on to do the Å¿ame to other <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants, and kill them in the Å¿ame manner. <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants bear very well the year after their planting, if plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>May;</hi> but yield very indifferently, if not planted till <hi>September,</hi> after they are taken out of the Woods; yet in the Å¿econd year they bear wonderfully, but that being paÅ¿t, they produce but very pitifully, and therefore 'tis good to renew them every two years; it is likewiÅ¿e convenient to cut off every year their old tops, when the <hi>Straw-berries</hi> are gone, which is commonly at the latter end of <hi>July.</hi> The earlieÅ¿t <hi>Straw-berries</hi> that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> are thoÅ¿e that were planted by the Å¿ides of <hi>Southern</hi> or <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tern</hi> Walls, and they that ripen laÅ¿t, are Å¿uch as are planted in a <hi>Northern ExpoÅ¿ition.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Shewing how long every <hi>Kitchen Plant</hi> may profitably Å¿tand in its place in a <hi>Kitchen-Garden;</hi> which of them muÅ¿t be houÅ¿ed in the ConÅ¿ervatory to Å¿upply us in the Winter, and which are they which we may force to grow by Art, in Å¿pite of the FroÅ¿t. And laÅ¿tly, how long each Å¿ort of Seed will laÅ¿t without loÅ¿ing its Virtue.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is a very important point in Gard'ning, to know how long every plant may uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the place where it grows in our Gardens, that Å¿o the forecaÅ¿t of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gard'ner, may prepare others immediately to Å¿ubÅ¿titute in the places of Å¿uch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as 'twere, but PaÅ¿Å¿engers, take up their places but a few Months; for by this means, not only there remains no unprofitable Å¿pot of Ground in our Gardens, but we Å¿eem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides to reap a Å¿enÅ¿ible pleaÅ¿ure by enjoying in Å¿ome SenÅ¿e beforehand Å¿ome things that are not yet in Nature.</p>
                        <p>To treat of this matter well, I think it very pertinent to Å¿peak firÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Plants that are of long duration, whether in reÅ¿pect of the time they take up in attaining to their Perfection, or of that in which they continue bearing. All Å¿orts of <hi>Grapes, Capers,</hi> and <hi>AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus,</hi> doubtleÅ¿s, hold the firÅ¿t Rank in this number, for <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Caper plants</hi> laÅ¿t five and twenty or thirty years, and as to <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> reckoning from the time we firÅ¿t Å¿ow or tranÅ¿plant them, we ought hardly ever to begin to gather them till their Å¿hoots be of a competent thickneÅ¿s, which happens not till the third or fourth year after, but after that time, provided they be placed in good Ground and carefully cultivated, they may very well be Å¿uffred to Å¿tand ten or twelve years, it being certain that they will not fail to Å¿hoot up and bear vigorouÅ¿ly and plentifully during all that time; but yet if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any decay in them Å¿ooner, we may deÅ¿troy and break them up Å¿ooner, and if on the contrary, we find them continue to produce well longer than we have limited, we may continue them longer in their places.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rasberry, Curran,</hi> and <hi>GooÅ¿eberry</hi> Å¿hrubs, eaÅ¿ily laÅ¿t eight or ten years.</p>

                        <p>There remains now nothing but to know how long each Å¿ort of Seed will keep good, upon which I muÅ¿t tell you, that generally Å¿peaking, moÅ¿t Seeds grow naught after one of two years at moÅ¿t, and therefore it concerns us always to be provided with new ones, if we would not run the hazard of Å¿owing to no purpoÅ¿e in the Spring.

                  <p>THE moÅ¿t Undegenerating Å¿ort of <hi>Melons</hi> are not large, but of a middling Size, the Rind thin, faintly Embroider'd, and without being Ribb'd or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided along the Sides, or at leaÅ¿t very obÅ¿curely: Others there are which be whitiÅ¿h, Å¿ome of a Slate-colour, Red-fleÅ¿h, dry, yet melting in the Mouth, and not at all Mealy, but of an high and generous GuÅ¿t. In a word, the only Å¿ort (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Trials of many hundred Kinds) I have Cultivated with SucceÅ¿s, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their good Qualities more than Twenty Years, without any conÅ¿iderable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Gard'ner</hi> now-a-days, knows how to raiÅ¿e <hi>Melons,</hi> but very few to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them; the greateÅ¿t difficulty whereof is in the Guelding of Superfluities, to cauÅ¿e them to knit, and bear as they Å¿hould do. In order to which, obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e few Directions:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48210:231"/>
The firÅ¿t thing appearing (after the Seed is Sown, and the Plants prick'd out from the <hi>Hot-Bed</hi> into a more temperate) are a pair of Å¿mall Å¿mooth Leaves, which (in <hi>France)</hi> we call the Ears, marked 1. 1. in the <hi>Figure</hi> above. A few days after, 'twixt theÅ¿e, comes up a Å¿ingle Leaf, which we call the FirÅ¿t Leaf, as being on the firÅ¿t Knot, <hi>noted</hi> 2. Next to this, in the Å¿ame place, and Å¿oon after, there appears another, which we term the Second Knot, <hi>marked</hi> 3. About the middle of whoÅ¿e Stalk there Å¿hoots out another Leaf, call'd the Third Knot, <hi>Figur'd</hi> 4. Which Third Knot is always to be Pruned off at <hi>Fig.</hi> 6. but with Care, and without Wounding the Stalk or Branch of the Second Knot, <hi>marked</hi> 3, upon which that Third did grow; it being from this place you will find that Branch to Sprout, which we call the FirÅ¿t Leader; and is that which will Å¿end out a FirÅ¿t, Second, and Third Knot; which Third (and all other Å¿uch Thirds) you muÅ¿t Cut, or pinch off, as you did the other, without Å¿taying 'till a Fourth, or Fifth, or more, Å¿hoot out. It is, I Å¿ay, from theÅ¿e Knots and Joints, that other Branches in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will proceed, knit, and form into Excellent Fruit, provided the Foot and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Stem have been well nouriÅ¿h'd in rich, warm, and proper Mould, and well expos'd.</p>
                  <p>I muÅ¿t not forget, that from the middle, likewiÅ¿e 'twixt the Ears and two firÅ¿t Leaves, there frequently riÅ¿es another Branch, which you may abate, or leave on, as you find it likely to prove, eÅ¿pecially if a vigorous one; but the Leaf <hi>Figur'd</hi> 5, iÅ¿Å¿uing from the middle of the Fourth Joint, and Å¿everal more beÅ¿ides, Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively Springing out of one another, as you Å¿ee the Fourth from the Third (and as all the reÅ¿t I have marked do) I purpoÅ¿ely omit, and have only Figur'd, as Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to the Ingenious <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I TranÅ¿plant from this <hi>NurÅ¿ery-Bed</hi> (into the prepared Holes or Ridges, and open <hi>Meloniere)</hi> I commonly place two <hi>Roots</hi> together, unleÅ¿s I meet with an extraordinary good Plant, and then Å¿pare both the Branches which Spring from each Å¿ide, 'twixt the Ear and Leaf 7, 7, as before is Å¿hew'd: But when I Plant two <hi>Roots</hi> near each other (as I do when they are not very fair ones) I totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both Branches which Å¿hoot from the two oppoÅ¿ite Ears, to avoid that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e Supernumeraries which injure the principal Stem and Foot it Å¿elf.</p>
                  <p>Never Å¿uffer the <hi>Root,</hi> or <hi>Stalks</hi> of your <hi>Melon</hi> Plants, to touch the Dung; nor Å¿hould you Water them immoderately, but when the Earth is very dry, and the SeaÅ¿on exceÅ¿Å¿ively hot, refreÅ¿h, and give the <hi>Roots</hi> Drink, without deferring it 'till the <hi>Shoots</hi> complain, when it may come too late: I Water them in theÅ¿e parching SeaÅ¿ons, two or three times every Week, and in the Evenings when the <hi>Sun</hi> is Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and then cover them with <hi>MatraÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> from Eleven 'till Two a Clock; and in the Afternoon during the <hi>Suns</hi> exceÅ¿Å¿ive violence, which ExhauÅ¿ts, and ConÅ¿umes the Humidity neceÅ¿Å¿ary to both <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Branches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cover my <hi>Meloniere</hi> alÅ¿o when it Rains, leÅ¿t too much MoiÅ¿ture prejudice the Fruit; all which requires a great deal of Care, and no Å¿mall Pains, though this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proceeding is to me a real PleaÅ¿ure.</p>
                  <p>When the Foot of your <hi>Melon</hi> Plant grows over Luxurious in Branches, cut away the feebleÅ¿t of them, leaving not above three or four of the moÅ¿t vigorous, and whoÅ¿e Knots grow neareÅ¿t to one another: And when the <hi>Melons</hi> are Knit, Å¿uffer not above two upon each Foot, chooÅ¿ing Å¿uch as are beÅ¿t plac'd, and neareÅ¿t to the main and principal Stem, which Å¿hould be thick, Å¿nug, and not too far above the Ground. Of theÅ¿e that are knit, and beginning to form, make choice of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿omeÅ¿t, that are well TruÅ¿s'd with a thick Å¿hort Tail; <hi>Melons</hi> with long Å¿tarts, Å¿lender, and narrow Leaves, never prove worth any thing.</p>
                  <p>When you begin to Cover with Bells, raiÅ¿e them Å¿o upon little Forks, as they neither reÅ¿t upon the Fruit or Branches, or quite exclude the Air; but Å¿o as to keep the edges from bruiÅ¿ing, and preÅ¿Å¿ing the tender <hi>Stalk,</hi> and Intercepting the Current <hi>Sap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It now and then happens, that there riÅ¿es a Å¿econd Branch from between the Ears, and two firÅ¿t Leaves (though I mention'd indeed but one) but this is very Å¿eldom; and you are Å¿till to count them but for one Joint or-Knot, though there will thence proceed a Second, Third, Fourth, and perhaps Twenty or Thirty more, and further remote, if you let them alone, and be not vigilant to reÅ¿train, and Å¿top this ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48210:231"/>
you'll find by the wither'd Branch, and dryneÅ¿s of the Leaves which Å¿hould skreen both Branches and Fruit, 'till they are Ripe, as we Å¿ee they do, where a <hi>Melon</hi> has a Å¿hort and Å¿ubÅ¿tantial Foot. A Curious <hi>Gard'ner</hi> therefore Å¿hould viÅ¿it his <hi>Meloniere</hi> from time to time, and be Cutting off all Mutilated, Starv'd and Vicious Branches which annoy the Plants, for theÅ¿e Impertinents will grow even to the view of ones Eye, and quite ImpoveriÅ¿h the Fruit, if not timely prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Thus you Å¿ee I am careful to Purge the Stems of all the Å¿mall, Å¿traggling, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Branches, from which there is no expectation of good Fruit, whilÅ¿t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erving thoÅ¿e that have well knit <hi>Melons</hi> on them at the ends of the Branches, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantly take away the reÅ¿t of that Branch on this Å¿ide the Fruit, which-divaricating into other uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Wanderers, would Rob, and deprive the Fruit of the Nutriment derived from the <hi>Root;</hi> nevertheleÅ¿s with this Caution, that in Pruning, I Å¿pare Å¿ome other leÅ¿s Noxious Branches to Å¿hade the Fruit, that it be not left quite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and expos'd to Å¿uch a Å¿corching Heat as would hinder its Growth and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, which within Forty days from its Nativity and knitting into Fruit, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives to full Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Great and Pumpion-like <hi>Melons</hi> are very Å¿eldom tollerably good, as arriving to their bulk either from the Nature of the Seed and Kind, or from Å¿uperfluous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Å¿maller ones; wherefore (though as I Å¿aid they cannot Å¿upport the too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ive Heats) the leÅ¿s Water you give your Plants (provided you find them not to want it) the better; and that rather a little at a time than much: Once a Week is for moÅ¿t part Å¿ufficient. As to this therefore you muÅ¿t determine, and regulate your RefreÅ¿hments with great CircumÅ¿pection, and Judge by the NouriÅ¿hment which you concieve NeceÅ¿Å¿ary to Produce and Maintain the Foot, with its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Leaves deriving from it; without which no Kind and Genuine Fruit is to be expected.</p>
                  <p>When you would Gather a Ripe <hi>Melon,</hi> you will have notice by its turning a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Yellow; for from that time, within a day (as the Weather proves) it does or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Ripen, and begin to caÅ¿t a grateful Scent: This YellowneÅ¿s appearing in Å¿ome part of it or other, and not Å¿eldom with Å¿ome Rift, or little CaÅ¿m's about the Stalk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moÅ¿t Infallible Indications of its being left rather too long, than too haÅ¿tily Gather'd: The <hi>Gard'ner</hi> muÅ¿t therefore not fail of ViÅ¿iting the <hi>Meloniere</hi> at the leaÅ¿t three times a day, Morning, Noon, and Evening, for this Critical time of Ripening. He will Å¿ometimes find <hi>Melons</hi> Ripen too faÅ¿t, but they are Å¿eldom or never Good, as proceeding rather from a Å¿ickly, or vicions <hi>Root,</hi> than from the Nature of the Plant, or Species of thoÅ¿e I Cultivate.</p>
                  <p>After Twenty four Hours keeping, or the next day after it has been Gather'd (for Å¿o long, contrary to Vulgar Opinion, it Å¿hould be preÅ¿erv'd in Å¿ome Å¿weet dry place) and not Eaten immediately as it comes from the Garden: A perfect and tranÅ¿cendent <hi>Melon</hi> will be Full, Juicy, and without any Vacuity (which you'll eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diÅ¿cern by Rapping a little with your Knuckles upon the outÅ¿ide of the Fruit) the Meat Å¿hould alÅ¿o be dry, or but a little Rorid meazing out of the Pulp; but by no means WatriÅ¿h and FlaÅ¿hy. To this add a Vermillion Colour, a grateful Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and an high and Racy TaÅ¿te.</p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿tly, ReÅ¿erve for Seed of that only which lies towards the Sunny Å¿ide of the <hi>Melon,</hi> which being immediately cleans'd from its MuÅ¿ilage, with a dry Linnen Cloth, ReÅ¿erve in Boxes, or Papers, in Å¿ome Temperate and Sweeter place.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>AMong the FloriÅ¿t Gard'ners, of whom there are a great many very able Men, one frequently meets with Å¿ome, pretending as if to them alone pertain'd the Government of Orange-Trees; and would make the World believe, that the Culture of thoÅ¿e Å¿ort of Trees is the only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter-Piece of Gard'ning; and upon this, make a great deal of Å¿hew, and talk mightily about the Preparation of Earths, and of finding out all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients which, they'll tell you, ought to go to their CompoÅ¿ition: Nor boaÅ¿t they leÅ¿s of their In-CaÅ¿ement, Potting, Waterings; the Å¿etting them in, bringing out, and ExpoÅ¿ure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome among 'em, who carry the Secret a great deal farther, and that pretend the Kinds and Species of Orange-Trees are almoÅ¿t infinite, and Å¿uch as (how true Å¿oever) were enough to affright the moÅ¿t Curious, if, as they would make one believe, every one of thoÅ¿e Kinds did abÅ¿olutely require a certain Specific Salt peculiar to them, and would imbark us upon Å¿uch an Ocean of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as hardly any Body would adventure upon a Voyage Å¿o dangerous, and where the Ship-wreck Å¿eems almoÅ¿t inevitable.</p>
                  <p>But, as in our Ort-yards and Olitorie Gardens, where the Number of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Å¿everal Kinds, do greatly exceed thoÅ¿e of Orange Trees, Experience
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48210:233"/>
teaches us, that the very Å¿ame Culture does very near Å¿erve for all Å¿orts of Kernel-Fruit, all kind of Stone-Fruit, and all Verdures whatÅ¿oever: Upon this Experience therefore we preÅ¿ume, that there needs no other Culture for all the Å¿orts of Orange Trees, and this upon very good AÅ¿Å¿urance, daily Trials, and convincing Proofs.</p>
                  <p>I Å¿hall not therefore Å¿tand upon Å¿o many and great Difficulties, by which both the one and the other have deterr'd many Curious PerÅ¿ons, PaÅ¿Å¿ionate Lovers of the Orange Tree: A PaÅ¿Å¿ion, in my Opinion, the moÅ¿t reaÅ¿onable, and beÅ¿t plac'd, of any; Å¿ince, in effect, through the whole extent of Gard'ning, we find neither Plant nor Trees that afford us Å¿o much Delight, and that are Å¿o laÅ¿ting: For there is not a day throughout the whole Year, wherein Orange Trees may not (and as they Å¿hould do,) gratifie and court their Lovers, either by the Verdure of their Leaves, the AgreeableneÅ¿s of their Shape, Plenty, and Perfume of their Flowers; and, in a word, the Beauty, GoodneÅ¿s, and DurableneÅ¿s of their Fruit; Å¿o as I muÅ¿t acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is no Man more charm'd with them than my Å¿elf.</p>
                  <p>In Favour therefore of Å¿uch whoÅ¿e Inclinations I find Å¿o general for theÅ¿e Trees, I take a third Party totally oppoÅ¿ite to the Doctrine of theÅ¿e MyÅ¿tery-Men, and do declare, that, after a long and ample Examination, there Å¿eems nothing in the whole Art of Gardning Å¿o eaÅ¿ie, and little difficult, as the Culture of Orange Trees, be it either the raiÅ¿ing them from their firÅ¿t Principles, the governing them afterwards, and maintaining them in good Condition, when once they have been Å¿et; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Recovery of thoÅ¿e that are Å¿ick, of any Difficulty; notwithÅ¿tanding all which, I think, one may (according to every Man's Ability,) reÅ¿olve to Å¿tore ones Å¿elf with <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> provided one have an able <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and a good <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> without which, indeed, I would adviÅ¿e none to enter upon this CurioÅ¿ity; for, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am, the <hi>OrangiÅ¿t Gard'ner</hi> is abÅ¿olutely guilty, and to blame, either through groÅ¿s Ignorance, LazineÅ¿s, want of Diligence, Application, or over-fondneÅ¿s to his myÅ¿terious Fancies, if his <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> do not thrive; provided, I Å¿ay, that his <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> be not faulty, nor the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Mould</hi> in which they are planted; or that the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> be not diÅ¿proportionate to the <hi>Root,</hi> or there be Å¿ome defect in the <hi>CaÅ¿ing,</hi> which may perhaps be ill made, or not in fit SeaÅ¿on, or, eÅ¿pecially, by over-watering, and the too much uÅ¿e of Fire during Winter, which is not at all needful, or of Water during Summer, which Å¿hould be given with great Moderation.</p>
                  <p>I Å¿hall, in the next place (after I have declared what my Opinion in general is, as to the eaÅ¿ie Culture of <hi>Orange-Trees,)</hi> explain, what Conditions are required in a good <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e:</hi> This eaÅ¿ie Culture, which I Å¿peak of, I know does not pleaÅ¿e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Doctor <hi>OrangiÅ¿ts:</hi> They'll tell ye, that both thoÅ¿e who believe it, and thoÅ¿e who publiÅ¿h it, do not themÅ¿elves underÅ¿tand it: However, without being in the leaÅ¿t diÅ¿courag'd with what they Å¿ay, I Å¿hall adventure to declare my Opinion upon this Matter.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the eaÅ¿ie Culture of <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN Confirmation of what I undertake to prove in this Chapter, I advance Five PropoÅ¿itions, which I hold for indubitable: The FirÅ¿t is, That we have hardly any <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Trees</hi> which take <hi>Root</hi> Å¿o eaÅ¿ily: Secondly, That there's none which Å¿o naturally agree with all Å¿orts of NouriÅ¿hment: Thirdly, That theÅ¿e are the moÅ¿t laÅ¿ting and longaevous <hi>Trees</hi> of all others: And in the Fourth Place, That there are none leÅ¿s obnoxious, and Å¿ubject to Infirmities: And LaÅ¿tly, None that have Å¿o few particular Enemies as <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tons,</hi> which kill our <hi>Strawberry-Plants</hi> at the <hi>Root,</hi> and the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> which Å¿poil their <hi>Leaves;</hi> the <hi>Canker-worm</hi> that cuts them off to the very Ground; the <hi>Field Mice, little Flies,</hi> and <hi>Gnats,</hi> which deÅ¿troy our <hi>Artichoaks:</hi> The <hi>Gumm, PiÅ¿mires, Å¿mall Fleas,</hi> that ruine <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> and the <hi>Tyger-bob</hi> which ravage the <hi>Pear-Trees;</hi> all theÅ¿e afflicting Accidents attacquing our <hi>Melons,</hi> and invading all our <hi>Olitory</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Garden</hi> Furniture, are what we may truly reckon to be the greateÅ¿t Enemies to <hi>Gard'ning</hi> in general; Enemies, I Å¿ay redoubtable Enemies, invincible, and by conÅ¿equence, a ThouÅ¿and Times more dangerous than any others whatÅ¿oever that menace our <hi>Orange-Trees:</hi> Some Foes I confeÅ¿s they have, nor are they altogether exempt, as there's no Plant which is; I Å¿hall here therefore examine them one by one, and in the mean time, preÅ¿cribe Å¿uch Remedies as are proper for their Cure and PreÅ¿ervation.</p>
                     <p>The particular Enemies of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are the <hi>PiÅ¿mires,</hi> the <hi>PunaiÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Bug, Ear-wigs, &amp;c.</hi> but all the MiÅ¿chief they are able to do, is far from being Mortal: There's nothing more eaÅ¿ie than a DefenÅ¿ive War againÅ¿t their rudeÅ¿t InÅ¿ults; for firÅ¿t of all, as to <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>PiÅ¿mires,</hi> which Å¿ometimes come upon <hi>Trees</hi> in whole Troops, and gnaw the <hi>Leaves;</hi> they rarely invade the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> Å¿ave when baited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic'd by <hi>Bug-Eggs:</hi> This filthy Spawn, (as all <hi>OrangiÅ¿ts</hi> well know without need of much DeÅ¿cription) can prejudice them no further, than to make the <hi>Tree</hi> look all over Å¿oul, Å¿qualid, and not Å¿o agreeable to the Eye as a <hi>Tree</hi> Å¿hould be, whoÅ¿e prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Beauty conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the NeatneÅ¿s and CleanneÅ¿s as well of its Boughs as Leaves; this Å¿ort of Filth is bred by certain winged <hi>Mother-InÅ¿ects,</hi> but too well known by their green Colour, and naÅ¿ty Smell, proceeding from their Bodies being bruiÅ¿ed: They lay their Spawn in <hi>Autumn,</hi> almoÅ¿t as do the <hi>Silk-worms,</hi> and wind their Bags eÅ¿pecially about the dry and withered Twigs, and under the foul and rumpled <hi>Leaves;</hi> one would take them at firÅ¿t but for little reddiÅ¿h Frecles and Spots, whilÅ¿t they no Å¿ooner appear on a <hi>Tree</hi> (how few Å¿oever they are) but the heat of Summer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes them grow, extend, and Å¿well, 'till they become as big as a Lentil, and then they hatch and multiply, and in Autumn again produce infinite Numbers of others: But as theÅ¿e NeÅ¿ts are neither errant, fugitive, or volatile, one eaÅ¿ily Å¿pies where they faÅ¿ten, and may as eaÅ¿ily take them away, Å¿o one begin the Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and eÅ¿pecially when firÅ¿t you bring the <hi>Trees</hi> forth of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e:</hi> TheÅ¿e

                        <hi>Earwigs,</hi> thoÅ¿e little, long, reddiÅ¿h, nimble InÅ¿ects, that now and then invade the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> (Å¿haring both <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> and marring their prime <hi>Beauty.)</hi> are not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily deÅ¿troy'd as thoÅ¿e we newly mentioned: But as the MiÅ¿chief is not Mortal, reaches not to the <hi>Roots,</hi> and happens but Å¿eldom, there are ways enough to prevent it; as by Å¿ticking up Caps of Paper, and Neat-hoofs in Å¿everal Places of each <hi>Tree:</hi> TheÅ¿e pernicious Å¿mall InÅ¿ects, that go out to forage during Night only, you'll be Å¿ure to meet with in their Retreat and hiding-Places as Å¿oon as 'tis Day, when viÅ¿iting the Hoods and Hoofes, you may cruÅ¿h them under Foot, and with eaÅ¿e diÅ¿patch them.</p>
                     <p>Another Expedient is by VeÅ¿Å¿els of Earth, Wood, Lead, or Copper made Å¿quare, or round, and hollow; there are alÅ¿o of them of two FaÅ¿hions; one whereof is to be Å¿et about the Stem of every <hi>Tree;</hi> the others under all the four Feet of each CaÅ¿e: ThoÅ¿e that are for the Stem or Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> are compoÅ¿ed of two Pieces, which may eaÅ¿ily be glew'd or cemented together, when they are plac'd about the Stem, and Å¿o accurately cloÅ¿e to it, as to hold the Water you pour into it: The others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t but of one Piece, which are to be put under the Feet of the CaÅ¿es, and Å¿o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with Water like the firÅ¿t, are an invincible ObÅ¿tacle againÅ¿t <hi>Earwigs,</hi> which being no good Swimmers, will hardly attempt the Liquid PaÅ¿Å¿age. Thus are <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> intirely Å¿afe from DeÅ¿olation by <hi>Earwigs.</hi> The Å¿ame VeÅ¿Å¿els are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e Protection againÅ¿t <hi>PiÅ¿mires;</hi> Å¿hould there any be Å¿o bold to adventure the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and get over to theÅ¿e beautiful <hi>Trees,</hi> as Å¿ome perhaps will try to do, though there be no more of that <hi>Bug-Spawn</hi> which Å¿o powerfully attracts them.</p>
                     <p>There are beÅ¿ides theÅ¿e miÅ¿chievous Minute Creatures (againÅ¿t which <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> require Defence) Å¿everal other great and Å¿ore Inconveniencies, to which they (in common with all other <hi>Fruit-Trees)</hi> are obnoxious, whilÅ¿t they Å¿tand abroad and are expoÅ¿ed: As namely, impetuous Winds, white and pretty hard FroÅ¿ts, and above all, great Hails; but Å¿ince Å¿uch Calamities happen rarely, a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> Å¿o Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd is rather to be extreamly pitied, than at all to be blam'd, eÅ¿pecially in caÅ¿e of Hail: 'Tis a MiÅ¿chief which comes like a Ruine on the Å¿udden, and which no Fore-Å¿ight can well prevent, be one's Carenever Å¿o great, and therefore no Remedy but Patience.</p>
                     <p>As for Danger of Winds, Å¿uch as for moÅ¿t part are thoÅ¿e between the <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> Å¿eldom blowing before the beginning of <hi>Autumn;</hi> they give fair Warning to Remove <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> to Å¿ome place of Shelter from their Fury; be it in Å¿ome HouÅ¿e, or under Protection of a Wall, or Grove of Trees, Å¿o plac'd and oppos'd to the Weather, as the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> may, at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome part of the Day, enjoy the Comfort of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Concerning FroÅ¿ts, in as much as we Å¿eldom bring <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> out of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> 'till it be towards <hi>Mid-May,</hi> and commonly Å¿hut them up again about the Middle of <hi>October:</hi> They are Times when theÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> are Å¿afe, and Å¿ufficiently out of their reach: TheÅ¿e kind of Spring FroÅ¿ts, which came in the tail of Winter, uÅ¿ually end about <hi>Mid-May;</hi> and the SeaÅ¿on praedicting their fierce Return, is not come at <hi>Mid-October:</hi> As for the Å¿mall White FroÅ¿ts, which Å¿ome times continue till half <hi>May</hi> is Å¿pent, and appear again at the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> they do no conÅ¿iderable Damage to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that are Sound and in Health: Indeed, the Sick and Crazy may Å¿uffer and receive Prejudice by them, by reaÅ¿on of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral TenderneÅ¿s, which they would not have done if Å¿trong and vigorous; that is, well govern'd, and treated as they ought to have been.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, being Å¿ufficiently aÅ¿Å¿ur'd, that the Beauty and PreÅ¿ervation of the <hi>Trees</hi> we diÅ¿courÅ¿e of, does in the firÅ¿t place, Å¿o entirely depend upon the being provided with a good and well-qualified <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> as that whoever pretends to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> is never to expect any tolerable SucceÅ¿s and Contentment, without beginning with this neceÅ¿Å¿ary Precaution: It follows, that before we proceed any farther in explaining what more belongs to their <hi>Culture</hi> and Government, the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> be the firÅ¿t Thing we ought next to Å¿peak of, as of the greateÅ¿t Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Conditions of a good <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO the having a good and well condition'd <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> there are in my Opinion, Five principal Qualities requiÅ¿ite: The FirÅ¿t is, That it be well plac'd and expos'd: Secondly, That it have Å¿ufficient Openings, and they well provided, and guarded with all that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Å¿hutting them up cloÅ¿e when the SeaÅ¿on requires it: Thirdly, That the Walls be made of a good ThickneÅ¿s, and Å¿ubÅ¿tantially built: Fourthly, That it be well cover'd: And laÅ¿tly, That the Floor be laid even and firm. Let us now examine each of theÅ¿e Conditions in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>As touching the FirÅ¿t, 'tis univerÅ¿ally agreed upon, That the <hi>Meridian</hi> ExpoÅ¿ure and Situation is abÅ¿olutely the beÅ¿t, Å¿o that it may enjoy the Sun from the Hour of Ten in the Morning, 'till it Å¿ets, or is almoÅ¿t ready to go down. The <hi>EaÅ¿tern</hi> Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which receives the <hi>Sun</hi> from its RiÅ¿ing till Noon, or a little after, is alÅ¿o very good. That of the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> which enjoys the Sun but from Noon to the Evening, may Å¿erve for want of the other two; whil'Å¿t the <hi>North</hi> is very pernicious and good for nothing, as hardly Å¿eeing the Sun at all either Morning or Afternoon.</p>
                     <p>The Second Property of a good <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> namely, That it have fair Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; requires that the Doors and Shutters be Å¿o made, as that the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> may eaÅ¿ily paÅ¿s thro' them; and the Windows large, and Å¿o high, as almoÅ¿t to touch the Timbers which Å¿upport the Cieling, which is commonly about three Foot, and five or Å¿ix Foot in breadth; Å¿o as having occaÅ¿ion to open them at any time in the Winter (as 'tis requiÅ¿ite) when the Sun Å¿hines invitingly, all the <hi>Trees</hi> may receive the Warmth and Comfort of his Beams: And in caÅ¿e any MoiÅ¿ture remain among them, it may be dried up by the Virtue of this bright Planet: TheÅ¿e Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Å¿hould alÅ¿o be fitted within Å¿ide of the HouÅ¿e, with <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿is</hi> of doubled Paper, that is, by glewing the Sheets on both Å¿ides of the Frame; and without this, another <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿is</hi> of GlaÅ¿s: As for other Shutters of Wood, they Å¿ignifie little, and are nothing comparable to the other, which Å¿hould be accurately Å¿topp'd, and cauk'd during the Winter, to Å¿eclude and keep out all acceÅ¿s of the cold Air from penetrating, which would infallibly chill and abate the warm and comfortable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which the Air in the HouÅ¿e received from the Sun, when the Windows were lately open'd upon thoÅ¿e fair Days we mentioned, and without which, the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> would not preÅ¿erve their good Looks.</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place, all the Walls of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> (thoÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially that are to the <hi>North)</hi> Å¿hould be built of good Free-Å¿tone and Mortar, Chalk and Sand (which doubtleÅ¿s is beÅ¿t) or of PlaÅ¿ter, (which is not the worÅ¿t) provided the Walls be Å¿o carefully wrought, and well joynted, that there be no Crevices or void Places left between the Stones: Where Stones are not eaÅ¿ily to be had, they may be built of Loame, tempered, and mingled with Straw or Hay; or with a double CloiÅ¿on made of Boards well Rabetted, filling the void between with Earth or <note n="*" place="margin">They in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> uÅ¿e <hi>Chaff,</hi> or, (which is certainly better, becauÅ¿e of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,) <hi>Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duÅ¿t,</hi> exceeding well dried in the Sun; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the whole HouÅ¿e a Coat of <hi>Pitch.</hi>
                        </note> Sand, Å¿o as the Walls and Partitions, as well of the one as the other, be at the leaÅ¿t two Foot, or two and an half, in thickneÅ¿s: Happy in the mean time are they, who with all this, have Å¿ome other Building, dry Bank, or Grove of tall Trees to bask it on the <hi>North!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Since both the Cold and Wet is apt to inÅ¿inuate and get in through the Roof and Covering, as well as through the Sides of the HouÅ¿e: The Cieling and Floor above ought to be of a good thickneÅ¿s; and beÅ¿ides that, be clad in Winter with a Thatch of Hay or Straw, unleÅ¿s there happen to be a Room or Lodging over Head, or Å¿ome Gallery, whoÅ¿e Windows alÅ¿o muÅ¿t be kept very cloÅ¿e Å¿hut, whilÅ¿t the cold Weather continues: Or, except at leaÅ¿t it be Å¿ubÅ¿tantially vaulted and cover'd with Å¿tore of Earth, or Å¿ome Å¿uch Material as we have deÅ¿crib'd. LaÅ¿tly,</p>
                     <p>The Lower Floor of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> (which cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be too dry) Å¿hould methinks, be laid a little higher than the Area or Walk without, or at leaÅ¿t even with it; but by no means much lower, for fear of DampneÅ¿s, which is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious than the Cold it Å¿elf; in as much as there's hardly any Remedy for this, as there is againÅ¿t the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48210:235"/>
ThoÅ¿e who have not heard what I formerly objected againÅ¿t the UÅ¿e of Fire, (which is Å¿ometimes made in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e)</hi> will preÅ¿ently conclude, that whilÅ¿t I diÅ¿courÅ¿e of Remedies againÅ¿t the Cold, I would have it underÅ¿tood to be Fire of Charcoal, which they commonly make in Å¿everal places of the HouÅ¿e; but in truth, I mean nothing leÅ¿s, Å¿eeing on the contrary, I am of Opinion and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Convinc'd, that Å¿ort of Fuel to be no leÅ¿s than Exitial, and hurtful to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> than either cold or wet, as I pretend to prove.</p>
                     <p>Having then Å¿poken of the height of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> Floor, it remains to Å¿hew, that it may be made of well beaten, hard and compacted <hi>Salpeter'd-</hi>Earth, or of PlaÅ¿ter; or which is to be preferr'd before all, a Floor of well lay'd Planks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ou de Salpetre batu.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what was Å¿aid of the height of the Floor, it needs muÅ¿t follow, that Cellars, and Vaults are very dangerous, and often Mortal, as well to <hi>Orange-Trees, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, JeÅ¿Å¿imines, Myrtles, &amp;c.</hi> as generally to all <hi>Cas'd,</hi> and <hi>Impotted Shrubs</hi> whatÅ¿oever, for that Å¿uch low Subterraneous places are commonly damp and moiÅ¿t, out of reach, and far from receiving any comfort from the Sun, without whoÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, no <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> can be fitly qualified.</p>
                     <p>As to the breadth and length of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> within Å¿ide, it were not deÅ¿irable it Å¿hould exceed Twenty-four Feet, although it might well be made from Thirty to Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Å¿ix, or a little more, nor would the HouÅ¿e be much the worÅ¿e, provided the height be withal proportionable, and Å¿o dry, as neither Cold, nor Wet get entrance. They are not the Sun beams immediately darting on the <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> Leaves, that are Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿entially Å¿alutary and propitious to them, Å¿eeing they Å¿eldom viÅ¿it the foliage in the middle, and interior parts of the branches, and head of the Tree, how ever advantagiouÅ¿ly expos'd; but they are thoÅ¿e Rays of the Sun, which Å¿hine into the whole Capacity of the HouÅ¿es, that diÅ¿pel, and hinder this humidity from Å¿ettling and doing the miÅ¿chief.</p>
                     <p>And thus having EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd for a general Maxim, that Å¿uppoÅ¿ing one is well provided of a good <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> it is eaÅ¿ie to be MaÅ¿ter of fair, and excellent <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi> I next come to explain more particularly, what my Opinion is of their <hi>Culture.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>TO Å¿peak of this as Intelligibly as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, I conceive there are five Articles to be conÅ¿ider'd; the knowledge of which, will be of great InÅ¿truction to the newly Curious: ThoÅ¿e I mean, who are altogether Strangers to theÅ¿e Matters, and are deÅ¿irous to Learn.</p>
                     <p>The FirÅ¿t, and which is very Important for the removing of many Scruples is about the CompoÅ¿ition of the Earth and Mould, moÅ¿t proper for the NouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Å¿uch <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> as we Plant in <hi>Pots</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿es.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second, treats of the way of RaiÅ¿ing them from Seed, and afterwards how to Graft them; and more eÅ¿pecially, what there's to be done to <hi>Trees</hi> of great, or leÅ¿Å¿er Growth, newly brought from other Countries, whether naked, Å¿trip'd, and without any Clod, or <hi>Earth</hi> adhering to the <hi>Roots</hi> (like other <hi>Fruit-Trees)</hi> or whether with their Leaves on, together with the Clod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When I Å¿ay, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in this manner, we would <hi>Impot</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>The Third Article, directs the Å¿hape, and bigneÅ¿s of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> to be us'd, and what is to be done about the Clod, and <hi>Roots</hi> of Å¿uch as are to be new <hi>CaÅ¿ed,</hi> with the manner of doing it, which are two EÅ¿Å¿ential points in this <hi>Culture,</hi> and alÅ¿o Rules concerning Watering.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Article, Å¿hews how to dreÅ¿s and faÅ¿hion the heads of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> whether it be to Recover Å¿uch as have been long neglected, or ill treated, or Å¿uch as have Å¿uffer'd by the FroÅ¿t, or humidity of Winter; or, that one would have handÅ¿om Trees, that Å¿hould always maintain their beautiful Figure in health and vigour, without loÅ¿ing their Leaves.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth concerns the NeceÅ¿Å¿ary Situation of the Places in which <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are to be Å¿et, when they are brought out of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> and (as every body knows) what time they Å¿hould be carried in, Å¿hut up, and expos'd again

                           <hi>Of the</hi> CompoÅ¿ition <hi>and</hi> Mixture <hi>of</hi> Earths, <hi>proper for the</hi> In-CaÅ¿ing Orange, <hi>and</hi> Lemon-Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SINCE <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees,</hi> are Strangers among us, and as one may Å¿ay, come Artificially into <hi>Climates</hi> Å¿ubject to rigorous <hi>Winters;</hi> as here in the IÅ¿le of <hi>France,</hi> and other <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, whereas they grow SpontaneouÅ¿ly and Naturally in warmer places. It makes Å¿ome to fancy, that this may partly proceed from Å¿ome defect in the <hi>Earth</hi> that's us'd, as well as from the <hi>Air</hi> we breathe in, which cauÅ¿es theÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> to undergo Å¿ome inconvenience here: And upon this, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Gard'ner</hi> makes a wondrous <hi>MyÅ¿tery,</hi> forÅ¿ooth, of certain peculiar <hi>CompoÅ¿itions</hi> of <hi>Earths,</hi> &amp;c. And of this, there are various ConteÅ¿ts, and very different Opinions. For,</p>
                     <p>Some will have the main Importance of the <hi>Mixture,</hi> to conÅ¿iÅ¿t as well in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of <hi>Ingredients</hi> (eÅ¿pecially if they be hard to come by) as in the Å¿everal <hi>DoÅ¿es:</hi> Others, in the frequent removing and Å¿tirring the Mould, Å¿o blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; without which, they conceive all the reÅ¿t unprofitable, and of no effect. There be others, who Å¿tand much upon the Antiquity, and Age of the <hi>CompoÅ¿ition;</hi> and that what has been longeÅ¿t made and prepared, is beÅ¿t: Some again, for that which has moÅ¿t been Å¿tirr'd. In fine, moÅ¿t of them make chiefeÅ¿t Account of the lighter <hi>Ingredients</hi> for their <hi>Mixture,</hi> namely, Å¿uch as is Sifted, and reduc'd to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, The <hi>Marc</hi> of <hi>Wine, Earth</hi> of an old <hi>Hot-bed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿hould never have done, Å¿hould I Å¿peak particularly to every <hi>OrangiÅ¿t's Conceit</hi> upon this Subject: 'Tis certain, there's hardly one of them but pretends to Å¿ome rare, and peculiar Secret, that no body has Å¿ave himÅ¿elf, and which he would not impart to another for any thing in the World. I'll Å¿uppoÅ¿e they all have reaÅ¿on to be Å¿atisfied with their manner of proceeding, nor is it for me to contradict them, none ever heard me CenÅ¿ure them for it: In the mean time, for my own part, as I think I have made choice of a Method EaÅ¿ie and Simple, and that appears to me very conformable to the general CourÅ¿e and Order of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nature of the <hi>Trees,</hi> under conÅ¿ideration, I Å¿hall endeavour to explain it to the Curious, and let them Å¿ee with what SucceÅ¿s I have long made uÅ¿e of it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. There are alÅ¿o, divers other Worthy PerÅ¿ons, who have thought good to purÅ¿ue my Method for their <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> who Å¿hall be my <hi>Vouchers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before I enter far on this Explication, I declare again (once for all) that whatever the <hi>Earth</hi> produces, be they <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Trees,</hi> there is none of them, (as to their <hi>Culture,</hi> their <hi>Complexion</hi> and <hi>ConÅ¿titution)</hi> more EaÅ¿ie, Tractable, and (as I may Å¿ay) Accommodant, than are <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees;</hi> the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they are Govern'd by, in Å¿everal places, viÅ¿ibly juÅ¿tifie it. One may, in my Opinion, fitly reÅ¿emble them to thoÅ¿e Healthy, and Vigorous Youths, who Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning themÅ¿elves to Debauchery, and diÅ¿orderly CourÅ¿es, their Juvenile Å¿trength does, for all that, often Repair the breaches of their irregular Lives; but it laÅ¿ts but for a certain time, the Young PerÅ¿on, accuÅ¿toming his Body to that, which in fine, muÅ¿t abÅ¿olutely deÅ¿troy him, or at leaÅ¿t extreamly alter, and impair its RobuÅ¿t CompoÅ¿ure. 'Tis juÅ¿t Å¿o with our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which are Naturally wonderful, Å¿trong and lively; Å¿o as by that, they eaÅ¿ily Repair whatever NouriÅ¿hment (though little agreeable to their kind) it be, that may corrupt and Å¿poil them. It is not with theÅ¿e <hi>Trees</hi> as with certain other <hi>Vegetables,</hi> Å¿ome of which will thrive and live no where, but in a dry and light Soil; others, Å¿ave in the Fat and MoiÅ¿t, whereas <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> live in either, but by no means thrive Å¿o well in one, as in the other.</p>
                     <p>That which I would eÅ¿pecially recommend to ObÅ¿ervation, concerning the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which (as we Å¿aid) are but Å¿trangers to our Climate, is to take good Notice out of what Å¿ort of <hi>Earth</hi> they were brought, and did Naturally grow in, and accordingly endeavour to Replant them in the like, as near as one can gueÅ¿s: By this Inquiry, I have found that they moÅ¿t Naturally thrive, and

grow to Perfection, in Strong, Fat, and Heavy <hi>Earth,</hi> and from thence conclude, that it were convenient, by Art, (which Å¿hould ever imitate Nature) to prepare Mould that were accordingly Rich and Weighty: But foraÅ¿much as theÅ¿e <hi>Trees,</hi> being Å¿et in <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> this heavy Fat <hi>Earth,</hi> which is to NouriÅ¿h them (without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance from the Neighbouring Mould) would be apt to grow dry, and hard almoÅ¿t as a Stone, Å¿o as becoming unfit for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> cannot Å¿pread and extend themÅ¿elves, without AdminiÅ¿tring Å¿ome Succour to them. It follows, that of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity we not only afford them due Watering and RefreÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but Å¿uch as may eaÅ¿ily, and univerÅ¿ally penetrate throughout, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿ome means muÅ¿t be found, that this <hi>Earth</hi> be well, and induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly Å¿tirr'd, and made looÅ¿e, to correct its Natural SluggiÅ¿hneÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>But you'll preÅ¿ently Object, as to this dull and heavy <hi>Material</hi> I Å¿o commend, That the Sun, which looks but obliquely upon us, cannot have the Å¿ame effects as it has in thoÅ¿e <hi>Climates</hi> where it Darts its Beams more directly. This is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objection of our <hi>OrangiÅ¿ts.</hi> To which I reply in the firÅ¿t place, That as every body Å¿ees (and is confirm'd by daily Experience) the Heat which we have here during the four or five Months in which our <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are expos'd, is Å¿ufficiently great to make them Live, and that with a great deal of vigour for a long time. In the Å¿econd place, That the <hi>Cas'd-Mould</hi> being open to the Air, and conÅ¿equently viÅ¿ited on every Å¿ide by the <hi>Sun,</hi> receives the ImpreÅ¿Å¿ions of its Heat almoÅ¿t as freely, as what being in the wide and open Field, enjoys its Beams on the Superficies only. And laÅ¿tly, That the <hi>Earth</hi> being thus made looÅ¿e, as well as ponderous, is by this Expedient render'd eaÅ¿ie and compliant for the <hi>Roots</hi> to Å¿pread in, and for the <hi>Water</hi> to penetrate and refreÅ¿h it, and by Å¿o much the more diÅ¿pos'd to entertain the impreÅ¿Å¿ions of the warmth which it requires: And thus we render it capable of receiving that by our Art, which would be Å¿uperfluous, and too much in the hotter Countries.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Foundation and ReaÅ¿on (be it in what Country Å¿oever) I endeavour to find out the beÅ¿t, natural Common-<hi>Earth,</hi> and leaÅ¿t Stony that I can light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all the Neighbourhood: That is to Å¿ay, Mould which has Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and is pretty Å¿olid; by no means Clay, which I look on as Dead, but Å¿uch as all Å¿orts of <hi>Plants</hi> Å¿eem naturally to delight in by their growth and thriving. Nor am I much concern'd what colour it is of, though for the moÅ¿t part, and to Å¿ight, the blacker be moÅ¿t agreeable and approv'd of. For Example, That which is proper for <hi>Hemp,</hi> good <hi>Wheat,</hi> or <hi>PaÅ¿ture-Ground,</hi> or of an <hi>High-way,</hi> or that lying low, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Water, and Drainings of Å¿ome higher rich Ground. Of this <hi>Earth</hi> I take as much as I have need, and without farther trouble of preferring that which lies uppermoÅ¿t, (and which indeed, is the beÅ¿t in moÅ¿t Mens Opinions) I rather chooÅ¿e that which lies undermoÅ¿t, provided it appears to be of the Å¿ame quality of that which is above it, ever Å¿eeking that which is freÅ¿heÅ¿t; I mean, that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never Å¿aw the <hi>Sun,</hi> and conÅ¿equently, has never yet Å¿erved to the NouriÅ¿hment of any <hi>Plant;</hi> Å¿o as 'tis not only to be preÅ¿um'd, that it retains in it all its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Salts,</hi> but a good part likewiÅ¿e of that which the upper, and Incumbent Ground, through which it has been the drain, contributes to it.</p>
                     <p>After this, viÅ¿iting the Folds, I procure dry <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> reduc'd almoÅ¿t to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; (and which is to be had in almoÅ¿t every Country) or for want of that, I Å¿eek for Soil where Sheep have formerly been pent; than which, there is nothing better and more Soveraign for the <hi>Trees</hi> we Å¿peak of. But in defect of this, I uÅ¿e either the Mould of well-rotted Leaves of <hi>Trees,</hi> or of an old <hi>Hot-Bed,</hi> that has not been over <hi>Sob'd</hi> and <hi>Water'd,</hi> without ever medling with the <hi>Marc,</hi> and <hi>Husks</hi> of <hi>Grapes</hi> for ReaÅ¿ons I Å¿hall alledge hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Now (as I Å¿aid above) I would have the Mould which I prepare, weighty, and yet Å¿o looÅ¿e withal, as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ConÅ¿idering then, how many <hi>Trees</hi> I have to <hi>In-CaÅ¿e,</hi> I accordingly order my <hi>CompoÅ¿ition,</hi> by taking, at leaÅ¿t, one half of that Natural <hi>Earth</hi> which I find near at hand, (and which is that which gives it that weight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

half of my <hi>Mixture,</hi> and imparts to it that lightneÅ¿s which I deÅ¿ire. All this do I mingle together the very Å¿ame day I have occaÅ¿ion for it (if I could not diÅ¿patch it Å¿ome days before) not thinking it at all neceÅ¿Å¿ary to have prepar'd it much Å¿oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that which induces me is, FirÅ¿t, That every <hi>Particle</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> contains evidently in it Å¿elf, its peculiar <hi>Vegetative Salt.</hi> Secondly, 'Tis certain That no <hi>Grain,</hi> or <hi>Particle</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> does enter into the Body of another <hi>Grain,</hi> much leÅ¿s into the Bodies of the <hi>Roots,</hi> which only common Water does, which drenching (as I may Å¿ay) the borrow'd <hi>Earth</hi> with the <hi>Salt</hi> of every part, receives more or leÅ¿s, according as the <hi>Earth</hi> is more or leÅ¿s charged with it: And this Water Å¿o Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, and SeaÅ¿on'd with the <hi>Salts</hi> of thoÅ¿e good <hi>Earths,</hi> is that which (as we have often noted) adminiÅ¿ters to the <hi>Roots</hi> that Food and NouriÅ¿hment which forms their <hi>Sap,</hi> which we affirm will be found Å¿o much better, according as the <hi>Earths</hi> (through which the Water has drain'd) renders them more Fruitful, and above all leÅ¿s Diluted.</p>
                     <p>This being Å¿o, it follows, That the Å¿taleneÅ¿s and oldneÅ¿s of the <hi>CompoÅ¿ition,</hi> Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more to its Melioration and Improvement, than the frequent Å¿tirring of it. On the contrary, methinks it were to be wiÅ¿h'd, that this <hi>Mixture,</hi> once made, and the <hi>Earths</hi> caÅ¿t into Heaps, were cover'd from the Rain, leÅ¿t the Waters falling upon them, waÅ¿h, and carry away the beÅ¿t part of it, and Å¿catter it unprofitably about the Å¿ides or bottom of the whole MaÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>Now to make our <hi>CompoÅ¿ition</hi> the more Å¿peedily and eaÅ¿ily, and indeed with more exactneÅ¿s; having firÅ¿t caÅ¿t all the <hi>Materials</hi> into Å¿everal Heaps, pretty near to one another, I cauÅ¿e as many Men as there are different <hi>Ingredients,</hi> with their Shovels and Spades, Å¿tanding by their reÅ¿pective Heaps, to caÅ¿t it equally, and in equal <hi>Portions</hi> Pell-mell in Å¿ome void place near them. For inÅ¿tance, If I have but one Å¿ingle Heap of good <hi>Earth,</hi> and another of <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> there will need but two Men to fling them equally from their Heaps, to make another Heap: And if with the Heap of good <hi>Earth,</hi> I have two or three of thoÅ¿e other <hi>Ingredients</hi> mention'd, I place as many Labourers near that Å¿ingle Heap of good <hi>Earth,</hi> as I do at all the other Heaps. And thus at one, and the Å¿ame inÅ¿tant, as a Shovel-full of <hi>Stuff</hi> is thrown from each of the two or three Å¿eparated Heaps, there may (at the Å¿ame time) be caÅ¿t as many Shovel-fulls of the Å¿ingle Heap of good <hi>Earth:</hi> And Å¿o my <hi>CompoÅ¿ition</hi> is Å¿oon finiÅ¿h'd, and made exactly, without loÅ¿ing any time, or of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a greater quantity, or removing more <hi>Ingredients</hi> than one needs.</p>
                     <p>From that which has been Å¿aid, it appears, That I neither much look after the <hi>Earth</hi> of <hi>Drains,</hi> Dry and Old <hi>Rotted Dirt, MarÅ¿hy,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿tings</hi> of <hi>Ditches, Pidgeons-Dung</hi> and the like, as well becauÅ¿e I can be very well without them when I have the others which put me to no trouble in finding (the facility and eaÅ¿ineÅ¿s in <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture</hi> being that which infinitely Charms me) as eÅ¿pecially, becauÅ¿e I eÅ¿teem them preferable, and much better, Å¿o as I never make uÅ¿e of the other when I can have theÅ¿e at hand, but upon the utmoÅ¿t Exigence and NeceÅ¿Å¿ity.</p>
                     <p>By this you alÅ¿o Å¿ee, I do not <hi>Plant</hi> in pure and Å¿imple <hi>Earth</hi> only, and leÅ¿s yet in that which is finely Sifted, as do divers <hi>Gard'ners.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> will I confeÅ¿s, make pretty <hi>Shoots</hi> in this <hi>Powder'd-Mould</hi> for a year or two, but 'tis as true, that they make no <hi>Clod,</hi> or <hi>Union,</hi> Å¿o as 'tis very difficult to <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> or change them upon occaÅ¿ion, without danger of leaving no Mould cleaving about the <hi>Roots;</hi> without which, you muÅ¿t look for nothing during that whole year, nor the next, but the dropping of their Leaves, whereas Å¿uch as are <hi>Planted</hi> in my <hi>CompoÅ¿ition,</hi> retain a fair luÅ¿ty <hi>Clod</hi> about them, from which one may (and as indeed one Å¿hould) pare off a good part when you <hi>Re-caÅ¿e</hi> them, Å¿o that as well the old <hi>Roots,</hi> as old and exhauÅ¿ted <hi>Earth,</hi> may be Å¿ufficiently abated, without any Peril of loÅ¿ing the <hi>Leaves,</hi> or RiÅ¿quing the <hi>Tree,</hi> but, on the contrary, make it Å¿tronger, and more beautiful, and begin to put forth conÅ¿iderable <hi>Shoots</hi> that very year.</p>
                     <p>This alÅ¿o Å¿hews, how little I attribute to the <hi>Marc</hi> of <hi>Wine:</hi> And firÅ¿t, for that the Water which muÅ¿t retain the TaÅ¿t and Quality of Wine (as in effect it would, if the <hi>Marc</hi> contain'd in it any, the leaÅ¿t Å¿ort of moiÅ¿ture, the Water, I Å¿ay, in which it were infus'd, participating of it) is really, not only improper, and not at all good for any kind of <hi>Plants,</hi> but extreamly pernicious to them. In the Å¿econd place, For that this <hi>Mare,</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ting, as it does, of three things, which contain in them no Å¿ort of Juice (namely, the Stone or Kirnel, the Skin, and the Stalk) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h nothing of advantage to <hi>Vegetation,</hi> for the Kirnels are commonly as hard as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stones, which Å¿carce ever rot or turn to <hi>Earth;</hi> the Skin, and Stalks for having been extreamly preÅ¿s'd, can yield nothing at all of NouriÅ¿hment. And all this we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48210:237"/>
find, in as much as the Water, wherein the <hi>Mares</hi> have been macerated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd a conÅ¿iderable while has no manner of TaÅ¿t or ReliÅ¿h in it; whereas the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which has percolated; and paÅ¿s'd through <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> or an old <hi>Melon-Bed,</hi> &amp;c. Å¿enÅ¿ibly retains in it Å¿omething of extraordinary, as appears by the Acrimony or the TaÅ¿t it leaves,</p>
                     <p>To conclude, After all the Pains that I have taken, I never yet obÅ¿erv'd that the <hi>Mare</hi> of Wine did Impinguate, and Inrich the Ground; it renders it indeed Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lighter (but without imparting to it any other Quality) and that's what I Å¿trive chiefly to avoid in <hi>Earths</hi> for <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> not only becauÅ¿e I would not have a <hi>Mold</hi> too light, but above all, that what does give it the lightneÅ¿s requiÅ¿ite, Å¿hould carry with it alÅ¿o Å¿omething of more UÅ¿eful and Soveraign towards the NouriÅ¿hment of <hi>Plants.</hi> BeÅ¿ides, if the <hi>Mare</hi> of Wine were of that AbÅ¿olute Importance for <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> what Å¿hould they do, or rather what had they done, who having <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> live in colder Countries, where Vine-yards to not Å¿ucceed or proÅ¿per?</p>
                     <p>Add to this, That as to the MoiÅ¿t and Colder <hi>Climates,</hi> and indeed other places alÅ¿o where the Soil is ChurliÅ¿h and over Binding (approaching the Nature of Clay) the <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> ought to have good and Å¿ufficient quantity of <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> or of thoÅ¿e other light, and tractable <hi>Ingredients,</hi> apt and diÅ¿pos'd to warm and heat; but which is not needful in hot, and more temporate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or in the good <hi>Earth</hi> of other places, Å¿o as on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions, one may go as far as two Thirds of <hi>Sheeps-Dung:</hi> And this laÅ¿t <hi>CompoÅ¿ition</hi> is I aÅ¿Å¿ure you, very proper and good to raiÅ¿e any Å¿ort of <hi>Plant</hi> in whatÅ¿oever, whether in <hi>Pot</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿e.</hi>

                     <p>I am not of Å¿ome Curious Mens Opinion, who hold that large and ample <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> hinder the Growth, and Thriving of young <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> unleÅ¿s they alÅ¿o ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they would grow and be worÅ¿e in the plain <hi>Earth,</hi> and open <hi>Field.</hi> 'Tis a great miÅ¿take to think that a Å¿ingle <hi>Root</hi> produces nothing of it Å¿elf; let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿o throughly heated, it will never exert any thing, if it be not Animated with a certain <hi>Vital-Principle,</hi> as I have fully demonÅ¿trated in one of the Chapters of my TreatiÅ¿e of Reflections. Now the ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion which muÅ¿t promote this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Å¿eems to proceed more Naturally from the Superficies than from the Å¿ides.</p>
                     <p>What remains to be Å¿poken concerning <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> is the <hi>Figure,</hi> which every body knows to be Square, for though they Å¿ometimes make little Round ones, and other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48210:238"/>
OblongiÅ¿h, they are not Å¿o agreeable, unleÅ¿s the height (without reckoning the Feet) correÅ¿pond, and anÅ¿wer the length; for to be large and low, or high, and but narrow, is very unÅ¿ightly: The Foot ought therefore ordinarily, to be from five, to Å¿ix Inches high, for <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> that are in height from one Foot and half, to two or three Feet. They may be Å¿ome Inches Å¿horter, if they be not above eight, ten, or twelve large; or be allow'd Å¿ome Inches more, if of three and half, or four Feet, which are the largeÅ¿t Size we Å¿ee any where us'd.</p>
                     <p>The beÅ¿t Timber to make <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> of is Oak, as the moÅ¿t durable: Firr, Beech, CheÅ¿nut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by no means proper. <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> may alÅ¿o be made of Barrel-board, or Pipe-Å¿taves, when they exceed not Twenty, or Two and Twenty Inches; but if more, of good Clap-board, and WainÅ¿cot full Inch thick, they will elÅ¿e be apt to break, and be diÅ¿-joynted when they come to be remov'd and carried by the <hi>Lever,</hi> eÅ¿pecially being large, full of Earth and heavy.</p>
                     <p>'Tis of great Importance to have their Feet of Å¿ound Oak, and made Square, and Proportionable to the bigneÅ¿s of the <hi>CaÅ¿es:</hi> AlÅ¿o, that the Bottoms be very Å¿ubÅ¿tantial, Å¿upported with Bars well Nail'd and faÅ¿ten'd, that they may be able du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to Å¿uÅ¿tain their Burden, and Å¿ecur'd from becoming Rotten, to which the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Waterings make them obnoxious: For it were deÅ¿irable that the <hi>Trees</hi> might continue in the Å¿ame <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> many Years without any neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Change, every Removing and Alteration being prejudicial to them. One Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e take Care, that the Bottoms of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> hold Å¿tanch, and without Å¿tarting; and that they may laÅ¿t the longer, it were in my Opinion requiÅ¿ite to give the InÅ¿ide a good Priming or two, with Å¿ome Oil-Colour'd, no matter what it be. This may perhaps Å¿eem needleÅ¿s, but I aÅ¿Å¿ure you upon Experience, you'll find it worth the Expence in the durableneÅ¿s of your <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and the benefit of the <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> which being thus accommodated will not need to be Å¿o often chang'd, provided you Govern them as I have Å¿hew'd, and that you <hi>In-CaÅ¿e</hi> them pretty high, and tread the <hi>Earth</hi> well at the bottom before you Re-plant them.</p>
                     <p>Every body knows that the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> Å¿hould be bor'd through in Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places with an Auger, if the Board be joyn'd cloÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e be laid at Å¿ome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable diÅ¿tance one from another, Bar-wiÅ¿e, for the more commodious draining, and paÅ¿Å¿age of the Å¿uperfluous Water, and often RefreÅ¿hments.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Box</hi> be of two Foot and halfSize, it were convenient to give it an Iron plate at each Corner, and under the Bars below, that the <hi>Levers</hi> (which you muÅ¿t of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity make uÅ¿e of, to Lift and TranÅ¿port Å¿o great a Burden by) do not break any of the Bars. I would alÅ¿o AdviÅ¿e, that two of the Å¿ides of the Boxes were contriv'd with Wickets, to open and Å¿hut at pleaÅ¿ure, by the help of Å¿ome Iron-Bars and Hooks, to hold them faÅ¿t in: Not that hereby one may give them an half <hi>In-CaÅ¿ing</hi> upon occaÅ¿ion, a thing I neither approve of or uÅ¿e (for ReaÅ¿ons hereafter) but that when ever there really is need of <hi>Re-IncaÅ¿ing</hi> large and great <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> one does the more eaÅ¿ily take them forth their Old <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> with the greater part of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Clod</hi> adhering, which one cannot Å¿o commodiouÅ¿ly and Å¿afely do otherwiÅ¿e, without danger of breaking and diÅ¿order.

                        <hi>RE-CASING</hi> an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> is Å¿ometimes NeceÅ¿Å¿ary, either for Å¿ome defect in the <hi>Box,</hi> or in regard of the <hi>Tree:</hi> As FirÅ¿t, When a <hi>Box,</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> is Å¿o broken through Age or other Accidents, that it cannot be removed without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the <hi>Tree</hi> it contains; or when it is too little and has not Å¿ufficient room to nouriÅ¿h, and entertain it in any longer.</p>

more receive that due NouriÅ¿hment in the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> which it requires: And therefore be it that the Mould is too Old, and much exhauÅ¿ted, or the Box too narrow in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the quantity of the <hi>Roots,</hi> on either of theÅ¿e defects, a new <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> is to be reÅ¿olv'd on.</p>
                     <p>Happy thoÅ¿e <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> or rather Happy the MaÅ¿ter of them, that has an able and Skillful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> to Govern 'em, and the Sagacity to prevent theÅ¿e Accidents, by a timely <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> before his <hi>Trees</hi> complain or Å¿uffer; being careful to do it before theÅ¿e Infirmities Å¿eize too far upon them, and perform it dextrouÅ¿ly with all the neceÅ¿Å¿ary circumÅ¿tances: He may then in the firÅ¿t place, be Å¿ure his <hi>Trees</hi> will regularly maintain their <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Verdure,</hi> which is no Å¿mall MaÅ¿ter-piece; and in the Å¿econd place, find them to Å¿hoot (that very year) almoÅ¿t as freely as if they had not at all been <hi>New-Cas'd,</hi> which is another extraordinary advantage. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, SuppoÅ¿ing it to have already attain'd as beautiful an Head as we have fancied in our Idea, there will be no farther need of Working upon that, or uÅ¿ing the Knife, though haply it may be convenient to pare away, and abate about two third parts of the <hi>Clod</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> which is about the <hi>Root;</hi> and thus have you an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> perfectly well <hi>Re-Cas'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to <hi>Re-CaÅ¿e</hi> (though the Tree may have been never Å¿o well Treated) whenever we obÅ¿erve it to have paÅ¿s'd a Summer without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to make as vigorous a Å¿hoot as 'twas wont to do; Å¿ince being neglected, until we find our Trees actually Å¿ick, and in an ill condition, one may aÅ¿Å¿uredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that either the Å¿ame year, or the next after, they'll in all probability loÅ¿e their Leaves, and that the very year of <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> they will make no Å¿hoot at all, or if they do put any out, none but Å¿uch as are very feeble, wretched and miÅ¿erable ones, with Å¿mall round Flowers, moÅ¿t of which will drop before they be Å¿pent or wither'd; Å¿o as of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, you will be oblig'd to cut off a very great part of the old Branches, and Å¿ometimes the entire Head, to ones infinite vexation, to behold the poor Trees in this Å¿ad and naked condition, and that for Å¿o long a time before they will recover, or afford you any Å¿atisfaction.</p>
                     <p>It is fit you Å¿hould have notice, that Å¿ometimes a <hi>CaÅ¿ed Orange-Tree</hi> (be it one brought from hot Countries, or that has only been newly chang'd into another Box) may now and then remain two, or three years without puÅ¿hing either Roots or Branches, whatever pains one takes about it, which is very irkÅ¿ome: But even in this caÅ¿e, one is not preÅ¿ently to deÅ¿pair of the Tree, or caÅ¿t it away, Å¿eeing Å¿o long as the Stem and Branches continue freÅ¿h, you may be Å¿ure it is alive, and may for all this Emerge. Nor will I adviÅ¿e you to change its <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> but to continue your wonted care of him as he Å¿tands, and you'll after a while find him to Recover, and anÅ¿wer all your Pains and Patience, it familiarly happening, that this Lethargie and Benumb'neÅ¿s (from I know not what unknown and Å¿ecret CauÅ¿e) is at laÅ¿t vanquiÅ¿h'd and overcome: But where an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> that (for inÅ¿tance) has been <hi>In-Cas'd,</hi> and diligently DreÅ¿s'd for three or four years, ceafes for a whole Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month to Spring at all, you may (as already we have noted) conclude that he is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be Sick, and Å¿peedily <hi>Re-CaÅ¿e</hi> him the next year following. To perform this well, you Å¿hall firÅ¿t of all pare off two Thirds of the Old <hi>Mould</hi> or <hi>Clod,</hi> which indeed looks very frightful at firÅ¿t to thoÅ¿e who are yet unacquainted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>CaÅ¿ed</hi> Trees: Though it be indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably neceÅ¿Å¿ary at every <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing,</hi> eÅ¿pecially if the Tree have been in the Å¿ame Box four or five years, or perhaps a a longer time; for 'tis Å¿ometimes expedient to diminiÅ¿h, and take away a full half of its <hi>Clod;</hi> as when through the negligence, or imprudence of former <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> you find a Tree become exceÅ¿Å¿ively GroÅ¿s and Over-grown, for want of being duly Prun'd and Trimm'd on its precedent <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ings.</hi> The Å¿econd thing to be done in <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> well, is before you begin this Important Work: In the firÅ¿t place to conÅ¿ider the Mould and Earth of the <hi>Clod:</hi> In the next, to Å¿ee what condition the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>Box</hi> is in. As for the Mould, if you find it over light, and that you conceive the Root has but a Å¿mall <hi>Clod</hi> about it, you muÅ¿t then Water it plentifully the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Å¿tir any thing, that Å¿o the MoiÅ¿ture may cauÅ¿e it to adhere to the Roots, leaÅ¿t otherwiÅ¿e the Earth fall wholly away from them, leaving them quite Naked when you come to take the Tree out of its <hi>CaÅ¿e;</hi> but if you perceive the Earth to be Å¿olid and material, Å¿o as in likelihood the Root has a Å¿ufficient <hi>Clod</hi> about it, you may altogether omit the previous Watering, and proceed to <hi>Un-CaÅ¿e:</hi> The Earth will hold well enough to the Roots, and you may Work without any danger.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Box,</hi> you were before to conÅ¿ider, whether it be fit to Å¿erve any more; and if Å¿o, to ReÅ¿erve it: If not, to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of it accordingly. Now for the Å¿aving
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48210:239"/>
of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> be it with a Wicket, or (as ordinarily) without any, you Å¿hould with Å¿ome fitting InÅ¿trument, Howe, or Trowel Å¿crape, and take away from about the Roots <hi>Clod</hi> and all the four Å¿ides of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> as much old Earth as until you can conveniently arrive at the <hi>Clod;</hi> and then alÅ¿o, pare off as much of the ancient <hi>Roots</hi> as you can without diÅ¿ordering of the <hi>Clod,</hi> of which you Å¿hould leave three parts. This is a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Operation for the cleanÅ¿ing of it quite round, which otherwiÅ¿e you would not be able to reach and come at. This done, lift the Tree out of the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> with either Å¿trength of Arm, if it be not too heavy, or by the help of a Crane, Pully, and Ropes if it be of too great a bulk; and Å¿o without demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hing any part of the Old <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> you may keep or make uÅ¿e of it again, either to <hi>Re-CaÅ¿e</hi> the Å¿ame Tree in, or Å¿ome other, whilÅ¿t the former, with Å¿ome Å¿mall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, may laÅ¿t perhaps four or five years longer: But if you find it not worth the mending, let it be broken up for the Fire, and Å¿o you Å¿hall come to the intire <hi>Clod,</hi> and as before, abating about two Thirds, or more of the Mould as you Å¿ee cauÅ¿e, Å¿ince in either reÅ¿pect, Retrenchments are to be made as well on every of the four Å¿ides, as underneath, Å¿craping away Å¿o much of the old ExhauÅ¿ted Earth, as till you diÅ¿cover, and lay bare about two Inches of the ends of the Roots that had been Cut, to be ReveÅ¿ted and turniÅ¿h'd in <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> with new and freÅ¿h Mould (as Å¿hall hereafter be Å¿hown) that Å¿o they may at their Extremities, put forth new and luÅ¿ty Roots, Å¿ufficiently to Re-eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the Tree.</p>
                     <p>By the way, I AdvertiÅ¿e, that in <hi>Pruning</hi> the Roots, which you will find twiÅ¿ted and intangled one within the other, you be careful to take clean away all that you Cut off, without leaving Å¿o much as a Fragment, or Chip remaining, thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Rotting, and Infecting of their Neighbours, which were very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. In a word, after theÅ¿e Retrenchments made of Earth and Roots, if the Weight and Bulk of Earth permit, I CounÅ¿el you to dip it in Å¿ome Tub, or VeÅ¿Å¿el full of Water or Fountain BaÅ¿in, deep enough to cover the intire <hi>Clod,</hi> and there to let it remain as long as the Water Works and Boils about it; for Å¿o it will, Å¿oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by degrees, where the ordinary Waterings could not penetrate, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Earth exceÅ¿Å¿ively dry'd, and Water taking place, will force out and expel the latent, and prejudicial Air which cauÅ¿es the Ebullition and DiÅ¿order.</p>
                     <p>So Å¿oon as the Boiling ceaÅ¿es, take the drenched Tree out of the Water, and placing it on Å¿ome <hi>Block</hi> or <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> laid Å¿ide-long (or any thing that Å¿tands a little higher than the Ground) there let it reÅ¿t until all the Water be drain'd from it, and it have almoÅ¿t quite done dropping: For this ReaÅ¿on, That whilÅ¿t the <hi>Clod</hi> is thus Å¿tream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Å¿hould one put it into a new Earth'd <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> it would make it all into a Mortar, which were very pernicious to the Tree; for being neceÅ¿Å¿arily oblig'd to preÅ¿s, and cloÅ¿e the Mould to the Å¿ides of the <hi>Clod,</hi> and crowd as much into the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, as well about the Naked Roots, as where ever one finds a void, it could not be, but the Earth thus moiÅ¿ten'd, beaten and preÅ¿s'd would turn all to pap and Mortar, which would at laÅ¿t grow hard, and petrifie like Stone, by all means to be prevented.</p>
                     <p>Now in caÅ¿e the <hi>Clod</hi> be too big to be thus plung'd in Water: When the <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> is finiÅ¿h'd, with a good big pointed Stake (made of Å¿ome hard Wood) or an Iron Crow or Pin made for the purpoÅ¿e; endeavour to pierce the <hi>Clod</hi> in Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of it, and pour Water in the holes gently from time to time, as long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t as it will imbibe any, and that you judge the whole MaÅ¿s of Earth may Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be Å¿oak'd with it.</p>
                     <p>Let us next proceed to fit our new <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> be it of the Å¿maller, middle, or largeÅ¿t Å¿ize: The CuÅ¿tom is, and 'tis a very good one, both for the benefit of the <hi>Roots,</hi> as for the preÅ¿ervation of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> bottom, to cover them with a Bed of RubbiÅ¿h, old Brick-Bats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the frequent Waterings draining through thoÅ¿e looÅ¿e Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, may not Stagnate and Corrupt, which would both Rot the <hi>Roots,</hi> and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> alÅ¿o. I would have this RubbiÅ¿h handÅ¿omly rang'd, pretty groÅ¿s and thick, Å¿uitable to the bigneÅ¿s and capacity of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> yet not to lye above three or four Inches thick, the leaÅ¿t Å¿iz'd <hi>Boxes</hi> two.</p>
                     <p>This done, 'tis Å¿ufficient to fill in as much prepar'd Earth as is requiÅ¿ite to Å¿et the <hi>Clod</hi> in, Å¿o as the Superficies be plac'd level with the brim of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> and then finiÅ¿h all, gently filling the void places at the Å¿ides, and give it all a plentiful Watering: So have you the true ordinary way of <hi>In-CaÅ¿ing</hi> all Å¿orts of Trees.</p>
                     <p>But, for as much as I perceive that by this manner of putting in the Mould, 'tis apt to Å¿ink, and Å¿ettle too much after a little while, and conÅ¿equently cauÅ¿e the <hi>Roots</hi> quickly to touch the bottoms of the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> which may extreamly prejudice the

Beauty of <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> make them look Yellow, put forth Å¿mall <hi>Shoots</hi> and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Å¿oon deÅ¿poil them of their Leaves, and Å¿o oblige one to change the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> every four, or five Years. I have conÅ¿ider'd the doing Å¿omething more, which has very well Å¿ucceeded with them, though I confeÅ¿s upon this account I have Å¿tirr'd up againÅ¿t me a great many among the <hi>OrangiÅ¿t-Gard'ners,</hi> who upon this, as well as my <hi>CompoÅ¿ition</hi> and <hi>Mixture</hi> of Earth, have looked on me as an <hi>Innovator,</hi> and as one may Å¿ay, a DiÅ¿turber of the Publick Peace, and as if I had at the Å¿ame time DiÅ¿honour'd both them and their AnceÅ¿tors: But let the SucceÅ¿s of my Method decide the ProceÅ¿s, to the ConfuÅ¿ion of the Envious.</p>
                     <p>See then how I <hi>Re-CaÅ¿e</hi> my Trees: So Å¿oon as I have laid upon the Bed of Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biÅ¿h a Foot of the prepar'd Earth, which I would have to be dry, or very little moiÅ¿t, I cauÅ¿e it to be exceedingly beaten with the FiÅ¿t, or with Å¿ome Rammer, or piece of Wood when it is for the leÅ¿Å¿er <hi>CaÅ¿es;</hi> or elÅ¿e make one to go into the bigger <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and tread the Mould Å¿ufficiently, Å¿o as it may Å¿ubÅ¿ide, and Å¿ettle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t once for all, whilÅ¿t the weight of the Earth, and agitation of its TranÅ¿port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would in time by the common Method, Å¿hake the <hi>Clod</hi> down to the very RubbiÅ¿h, and bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> to the great Damage of the Tree, which I would by all means prevent, as I have already Å¿hew'd.</p>
                     <p>And Å¿ince my purpoÅ¿e is, FirÅ¿t, That in <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing,</hi> the Superficies or upper part of the <hi>Clod</hi> Å¿hould exceed the Brim of the <hi>Box</hi> three or four Inches, as certainly knowing that notwithÅ¿tanding all the Treading and Ramming, the <hi>Clod</hi> will in leÅ¿s than three or four Years, be Å¿o Å¿unk down, as to be no higher than the Edge of the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> (as it happens at the firÅ¿t in the ordinary way above deÅ¿cribed) though the bottom of the <hi>Clod</hi> be well enough plac'd: And, Å¿ince alÅ¿o I would that the <hi>Clod</hi> Å¿hould meet, and touch three or four Inches of the well-looÅ¿en'd Mould, into which the naked <hi>Roots</hi> may commodiouÅ¿ly enter and inÅ¿inuate themÅ¿elves. Upon theÅ¿e two ConÅ¿iderations I govern my Å¿elf, as well for the due RepleniÅ¿hing the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> with Earth, to the place where it touches the bottom of the <hi>Clod,</hi> as for the well Ramming and Treading of it, as by degrees (and Bed upon Bed) I caÅ¿t it in, 'til the whole <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> be full within three or four Inches of the top, which Å¿hould remain looÅ¿e, and not be Trodden at all.</p>
                     <p>After all theÅ¿e Precautions, I Å¿o Plant my <hi>Clod,</hi> as that its Stem be juÅ¿t in the Center of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> and Å¿tand exactly upright. To do which, you Å¿hall draw Diagonal Lines from Corner to Corner; by the DecuÅ¿Å¿ation of which, you cannot fail of placing it Accurately in the middle. Then for RepleniÅ¿hing the void places about the <hi>Clod</hi> to the height of its Superficies, I uÅ¿e to cram and preÅ¿s in of the prepar'd Mould (as much as is needful) with the end of a little piece of Wood or Barrel Board, which forces and crowds the Earth in Å¿o very hard, as from that very day forward, Å¿ettles the Tree, without looÅ¿ing its Perpendicular, and EÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hes it againÅ¿t all ordinary Winds, Motions, or TranÅ¿portings of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever.</p>
                     <p>Now to keep the Earth (which I AdviÅ¿e Å¿hould conÅ¿iderably exceed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of the <hi>CaÅ¿e)</hi> from Å¿liding down, eÅ¿pecially, that when you refreÅ¿h it, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter run not down unprofitably by the Å¿ides, I order pieces of Boards of four or five Inches breadth, be applied to all the four Å¿ides of the <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> Å¿inking and preÅ¿Å¿ing in one of the Edges of the Boards between the Earth and the Å¿ide of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> to <note place="margin">Mettre des hauÅ¿Å¿es.</note> keep up the Mould Å¿o heaped above the Level of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> brims: Nor is this any great Eye-Å¿ore, provided the Boards be handÅ¿omly plac'd, which otherwiÅ¿e I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿s it would be; but however, 'tis neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be done, the benefit and uÅ¿e eaÅ¿ily reconciles one to the CuÅ¿tom, as well as its being to continue but a few Years, for Å¿o Å¿oon as the <hi>Clod</hi> is once deÅ¿cended as low as it Å¿hould go, they Å¿ignifie nothing, and you may take them away.</p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, The Tree and Å¿ide Boards plac'd in this Order, I make a Å¿mall Circle of three or four Fingers deep in the upper Earth, 'twixt the Extremities of the <hi>Clod</hi> and this new looÅ¿e Mould, and then by degrees, pouring Water into the Channel, and RefreÅ¿hing it plentifully, the Mould by this time cloÅ¿ed to the ends of the new cut <hi>Roots,</hi> will Å¿oon diÅ¿poÅ¿e them to exerciÅ¿e their Function, which is to produce new ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Å¿hall in the next Chapter Å¿peak concerning what other Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and RefreÅ¿hments are to be given after this firÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>One thing I muÅ¿t not forget, That inÅ¿tead of <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> they often make uÅ¿e of <hi>VaÅ¿as,</hi> and <hi>Earthen-Pots;</hi> and many now a-days would perÅ¿wade us, that certain <hi>VaÅ¿as</hi> of a peculiar Fabrick, are incomparably better than <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Boxes:</hi> In the mean time, I am not of that Opinion, Å¿ince by long Experience, we all find the

many Conveniences of <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and the great Inconvenience of <hi>Pots.</hi> I confeÅ¿s <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>VaÅ¿as</hi> may be proper enough for ordinary <hi>Trees,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e of the new Make, Å¿eeing beÅ¿ides that they are very Beautiful, both for their Shape and fine Paintings; they are alÅ¿o capable of Earth enough (for Å¿ome time at leaÅ¿t) for thoÅ¿e leÅ¿s Curious Å¿orts of <hi>Trees,</hi> without needing Å¿o great, and Å¿o frequent Waterings, which I do not Approve of, nor of Å¿uch often Changes, which I like as little. But for great and well-grown Trees, abounding in <hi>Roots,</hi> and diÅ¿pos'd to IncreaÅ¿e them with new ones, when they are well Planted, I do not think <hi>VaÅ¿as</hi> (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made of Capacity to furniÅ¿h Å¿ufficient Matter, and maintain them well any conÅ¿iderable time) can be Å¿o proper, and convenient, as are our ordinary <hi>CaÅ¿es.</hi> Concerning the Inconvenience of the UÅ¿e of <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>VaÅ¿as:</hi> Trees that have am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and goodly Heads, ought to be Å¿o Å¿teadily plac'd, and at large, as to be able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the ImpetuoÅ¿ity of the Winds, which <hi>VaÅ¿as</hi> do not afford them, whoÅ¿e Å¿light, and narrow Feet, commonly make them Å¿ubject to be over-thrown, and conÅ¿equently Å¿poil'd, beÅ¿ides their fragility and brittleneÅ¿s; Å¿uch Trees are therefore in continual danger of unexpected <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> upon all Å¿uch Accidents.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, without entring farther into this ControverÅ¿ie, upon any PhiloÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Account, in favour of <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>VaÅ¿as;</hi> and eÅ¿pecially, upon the ConÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain. <hi>AntiperiÅ¿taÅ¿is</hi> (which I do not at all Comprehend) I am Å¿ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd, that generally Å¿peaking, this Novel Mode, is none of the beÅ¿t, and that <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> are much to be preferr'd, and a thouÅ¿and times better for Service, and more Commodious, though there go about of late, certain ManuÅ¿cripts, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to turn our UÅ¿e of <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> to Ridicule.</p>

                        <p>Of <hi>Watering:</hi> Its UÅ¿e and Way of Applying it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Come now to the UÅ¿e and Manner of ordinary <hi>Watering</hi> and RefreÅ¿hing of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> either during <hi>Winter</hi> in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> or particularly in <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-</hi>time whilÅ¿t they Å¿tand Abroad: And the Difficulty is in my Opinion great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it appears at firÅ¿t, for as if it were of little Importance, moÅ¿t of our <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> perÅ¿waded of the great NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of it, but unwilling to take the pains of fetching the Water, leave it for the moÅ¿t part to the moÅ¿t Ignorant of their Boys and Drudges, and think it well, Å¿o their Trees be often and Å¿oundly Drench'd; that is to Å¿ay, Three or four times a Week, and Å¿ometimes more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and that Å¿o profuÅ¿ely, as that it Streams out at the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> in that abundance, that the Neighbour places where they Å¿tand, are commonly all in a Puddle, and unacceÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge that theÅ¿e <hi>Gard'ners</hi> have good ReaÅ¿on to <hi>Water</hi> well, becauÅ¿e of the lightneÅ¿s of the Mould they uÅ¿e for <hi>In-CaÅ¿ings:</hi> That is, having (as I reckon) committed an Error at firÅ¿t, through Ignorance, they think of mending it by a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; which, whatever be the Fault, (conÅ¿ider'd in it Å¿elf) hinders for a time, the firÅ¿t from being as pernicious as it would have been without a Å¿econd.</p>
                     <p>For my own particular, I am extreamly Å¿crupulous, and Å¿paring as to point of <hi>Waterings;</hi> not that I totally forbid it, it being of Å¿o AbÅ¿olute NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, eÅ¿pecially during the great and extraordinary Drouths and Heats of <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> whilÅ¿t the <hi>Roots</hi> are (as one may Å¿ay) more Animated than in the former Months: BeÅ¿ides, that they be then moÅ¿t Stirring and Active, it being the SeaÅ¿on of their <hi>Flowering,</hi> and putting out new <hi>Shoots,</hi> &amp;c. But I Å¿hould not CounÅ¿el you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ive reiterated, or over frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> excepting it be during thoÅ¿e Months above-mention'd, as being the moÅ¿t Important, and ConÅ¿iderable for <hi>Vegetation;</hi> when yet it will be Å¿ufficient to beÅ¿tow on them two good Weekly <hi>Waterings,</hi> and no more. I Å¿tint it to that number, becauÅ¿e I certainly know, that in the fat and Å¿luggiÅ¿h Earth I make uÅ¿e of, there is no Å¿uch great occaÅ¿ion for great and frequent RefreÅ¿hings, and that it would be extreamly prejudicial to the Trees that receive them; and expect withal, that we Å¿hall Å¿ee conÅ¿iderable Change, in the Common UÅ¿e of great, and often <hi>Waterings,</hi> if one would apply them in the Ancient <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition</hi> of <hi>Moulds.</hi>

Certain it is, that Earths which are light, and which (as they Å¿peak) have little or no Body and ConÅ¿iÅ¿tence, coming to be Watred in any Å¿ort, will hardly retain Å¿ufficient MoiÅ¿ture for any time, as indeed they Å¿hould: On the contrary, they quickly become dry, by reaÅ¿on of the eaÅ¿ie paÅ¿Å¿age which the Water finds, as well through the looÅ¿e Mould, as through the very <hi>CaÅ¿es,</hi> and Å¿o the Trees not finding their <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿ufficiently RefreÅ¿h'd (of which they have now moÅ¿t need, to Å¿et them in motion) are Å¿ubject to pine away and wither, unleÅ¿s they be plied with Water. In Å¿uch kind of Earth therefore, 'tis indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably neceÅ¿Å¿ary to repeat it; but, as 'tis only want of MoiÅ¿ture, which makes them dwindle thus, Å¿o thoÅ¿e Earths which we have deÅ¿crib'd above, being of ConÅ¿iÅ¿tence naturally to retain their MoiÅ¿ture, and continue FreÅ¿h, how little Å¿oever you <hi>Water</hi> them, will preÅ¿erve the Trees from that Infirmity, and enable them to exert their Genuine Activity, in Å¿ending forth good <hi>Roots,</hi> and conÅ¿equently fair <hi>Shoots,</hi> large and ample Leaves, and beautiful Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, maintain themÅ¿elves in perfect Health, without needing Å¿uch abundant, and continual <hi>Waterings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Rules which I follow as to <hi>Waterings,</hi> concern firÅ¿t of all, that which is given immediately either after their being put into the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> or at their bringing out. And Å¿econdly, thoÅ¿e RefreÅ¿hings which are given during all the time that <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> Å¿tand abroad, Å¿ome of theÅ¿e <hi>Waterings</hi> I make to be great, others mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate: ThoÅ¿e I call great, when pouring Water on the Earth, it drop out at the bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> but Å¿o as it be very little or nothing; and Å¿uch <hi>Waterings</hi> are profitable, provided one uÅ¿e them not too often. ThoÅ¿e I call Moderate, which I caÅ¿t on to RefreÅ¿h the <hi>Surface-Clod</hi> only, and maintain the MoiÅ¿ture that has been conÅ¿um'd, as well by the Heat, and DryneÅ¿s of the Air, as by the Attraction of the <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for thoÅ¿e RefreÅ¿hings which are given immediately after they are Å¿et into the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> I would beÅ¿tow a plentiful one, Å¿o Å¿oon as the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are placed where they muÅ¿t Å¿tand during all the time of their Confinement; and that which JuÅ¿tifies it, is, The neceÅ¿Å¿ary CloÅ¿ing of the Mould about the <hi>Roots,</hi> which in TranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, the Å¿haking, and agitation of the Stem, may have Å¿eparated both from it and the <hi>Roots,</hi> letting the Air into the void places, which would prove an invincible obÅ¿tacle to their Action, which (as we have often noted) never move or thrive in any <hi>Plant,</hi> Å¿ave when the <hi>Roots,</hi> and the moiÅ¿t Earth, immediately unite, which is effected by a good <hi>Watering,</hi> and prevents the diÅ¿order one is to apprehend, when a Tree is DiÅ¿abl'd from Acting according to its Nature.</p>
                     <p>Having finiÅ¿h'd this great RefreÅ¿hment of our CloiÅ¿ter'd <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> I hardly give them any more, unleÅ¿s it be very Å¿paringly at the entrance and expiration of <hi>April,</hi> when the SeaÅ¿on growing mild, the Inclos'd Trees themÅ¿elves become Å¿enÅ¿ible of it; and then one Å¿hould not fail of Å¿etting open the Doors and Windows of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> often, Å¿o as the Heat of the Sun augmenting by degrees, its Beams, or the newly warmed Air at leaÅ¿t, qualifying the Room, the Earth about the Trees becomes a little more thirÅ¿ty, and being heated, urges the <hi>Roots</hi> to begin to <hi>Shoot</hi> and <hi>Quicken</hi> apace. I Å¿ay, Quicken and Augment their Motion; for 'tis certain, (as I have elÅ¿ewhere Å¿hew'd) <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as well as all other <hi>Verdures,</hi> are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Action, and that in the very HouÅ¿e, elÅ¿e would both their Fruits, and Leaves infallibly drop off, as being only preÅ¿erv'd, and faÅ¿tned to them by Vertue of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which continually maintains, and gives them NouriÅ¿hment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, theÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> do Act and Move leÅ¿s Å¿ome time than in another; that is, more Å¿lowly in Winter than in Summer, when the Sun (which is the Parent of all things Living) favours them with his benign Influence: But excepting only this Month of <hi>April,</hi> I totally ceaÅ¿e from <hi>Watering</hi> all the Winter long; and in this I Å¿ay nothing New, all diÅ¿creet <hi>Gardners</hi> obÅ¿erve it, and very rarely give I any Water at the beginning even of <hi>May,</hi> becauÅ¿e its approaching Å¿o near the time of freeing the Trees from their long Confinement, I Å¿ee no NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of making the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> heavier by <hi>Watering,</hi> which one Å¿hall find weighty enough already, and Å¿ufficiently difficult to T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By the way, I make no reckoning at all of certain <hi>CaÅ¿ts</hi> and <hi>Sproutings,</hi> which Å¿ome <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> now and then puÅ¿h out during Winter; nor in truth are they good, as appears by the withering of their Tops, and falling of the Leaves; Å¿o as inÅ¿tead of its perÅ¿wading me thoÅ¿e Trees Å¿hould be <hi>Water'd,</hi> that they may make better <hi>Shoots,</hi> I rather pull them quite off, as Å¿uperfluous, and good for nothing, but unprofitably to avert the <hi>Sap</hi> from the other more Å¿ubÅ¿tantial <hi>Parts, Branches</hi> and <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage,</hi> which it Å¿hould Augment and Fortifie.</p>

The Work I would have beÅ¿tow'd about <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> whilÅ¿t they are <hi>inclos'd,</hi> in order to their neceÅ¿Å¿ary PoliteneÅ¿s, is to finiÅ¿h the making them clean from the Filth and Ordure, which the <hi>PunaiÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Buggs</hi> have left behind, and that has not yet been well taken away; and that if any may here or there Å¿eem to wither, a little Water be given to it, but in very little quantity, Å¿ince it proceeds only from Å¿ome of the Superficial Roots that Å¿uffer, for the Water which was given upon their firÅ¿t ConÅ¿inement, has doubtleÅ¿s ConÅ¿erv'd the Body of the Tree, and bottom of the <hi>Clod</hi> Å¿ufficiently MoiÅ¿t: Since having not yet undergon any Å¿uch Å¿corching heats of the <hi>Sun</hi> as was able to dry them up, they can Å¿uffer no Å¿uch exceÅ¿Å¿ive ThirÅ¿t, and therefore a very Å¿mall RefreÅ¿hing will Å¿oon revive the drooping Leaves. As for thoÅ¿e which Å¿tand Å¿ound and vigorous in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> maintaining their Leaves freÅ¿h, large, upright and open, they are only to be look'd on and admir'd.</p>
                     <p>What I have Å¿aid concerning <hi>Watering</hi> Confined <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood (and that with greater rigour and exactneÅ¿s) of the <hi>Watering</hi> of all Trees and Shrubs that are their Fellow-PriÅ¿oners; Å¿uch as <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿imines, Granads,</hi> &amp;c. the over-frequent <hi>Waterings</hi> Å¿poiling their Roots, and injuring the Trees; and beÅ¿ides they Naturally are not Å¿o Active as <hi>Orange, Lemon,</hi> and <hi>Myrtle-Trees,</hi> theÅ¿e latter Å¿ort giving Indications for moÅ¿t part, by the Å¿aint and pallid Complexion of the Leaves, when they Å¿tand in need of a little RefreÅ¿hment.</p>
                     <p>I would moreover for all Å¿orts of <hi>Cas'd-Trees,</hi> whether in the HouÅ¿e or Abroad, that the upmoÅ¿t Earth Å¿hould be always kept looÅ¿e, and appear as if newly Å¿tirr'd; Å¿ince beÅ¿ides, this Å¿light motion yields a marvellous Relief and Succour, by facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the penetration of the RefreÅ¿hments you give them, and Å¿hews very handÅ¿omly to the Eye, whilÅ¿t the Chap'd, Cloven, and CruÅ¿ty Surface is as unÅ¿ightly, I would therefore have it alÅ¿o a little Å¿prinkled.</p>
                     <p>We come now laÅ¿tly to <hi>Waterings</hi> abroad out of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> as being in truth that which requires a great deal of DiÅ¿cretion, and in which methinks they commonly moÅ¿t fail.</p>
                     <p>As Å¿oon therefore as you bring forth your Trees, and have Rang'd them in the Stations where they are to continue, beÅ¿tow upon them as plentiful a <hi>Watering</hi> as you were Advis'd to do when firÅ¿t you Hous'd them: I Å¿ay, let this be a thorough and bountiful RefreÅ¿hment; which to do effectually, make Å¿everal holes in the Earth with Å¿ome Iron-Pin, or Stake of hard Wood, but withal Å¿o cautiouÅ¿ly, as not to gall any of the Roots: By this expedient the Water will viÅ¿it every part of the <hi>Clod</hi> as 'tis neceÅ¿Å¿ary it Å¿hould.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides this firÅ¿t plentiful <hi>Watering,</hi> I allow them alÅ¿o two conÅ¿iderable ones more every Week, Å¿o long as I Å¿ee the Trees to Flower and Spring; namely in the Months of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and conÅ¿equently (if the SeaÅ¿on prove very hot and dry) to Mid-<hi>October,</hi> when they are to be Hous'd, and which Å¿ome, Trees will themÅ¿elves AdvertiÅ¿e you of, by the crumpling, half cloÅ¿ing, and hanging down of their flaccid Leaves, giving notice that they want RefreÅ¿hment, as you'll alÅ¿o find if you thruÅ¿t your Hand a little down into the Earth by its being dry. I would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e every Ten days, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thereabouts, order them a conÅ¿iderable RefreÅ¿hing, and Å¿ometimes a Å¿econd moderate one, eÅ¿pecially in <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> when commonly <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> make new Shoots, Å¿o as you do not repeat it in caÅ¿e the Mould be moiÅ¿t enough already, for 'tis not always the dryneÅ¿s of the Earth which cauÅ¿es the Leaves to wither, they faint oftentimes before a following TempeÅ¿t, or that the Tree be not well EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd, is looÅ¿e in the Roots, or too much expos'd to the <hi>Sun.</hi> In Å¿uch caÅ¿es you are ever to Examine of what Temper the Earth is, dry or moiÅ¿t, and accordingly to Govern the <hi>Waterings.</hi> NotwithÅ¿tanding all this, every body finds that Å¿ome Å¿ort of Trees will always look faint and Å¿ickly, whatever boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Waterings</hi> you beÅ¿tow upon them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very certain as to this particular, I have often obÅ¿erv'd two things: FirÅ¿t, That when Å¿ome <hi>Gard'ners</hi> have Command of Water, they are commonly apt to over Water their <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> either themÅ¿elves or by their Servants. And in the Å¿econd place, Some extreamly neglect to do it, and give them not Å¿ufficient, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where it requires pains to fetch the Water, LazineÅ¿s or ill CuÅ¿tom carrying them to theÅ¿e Extreams. 'Tis I Å¿ay moÅ¿t certain, that as to the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e two CaÅ¿es, I would not they Å¿hould exceed very moderate RefreÅ¿hments, finding that they commonly give them too much: And to the Å¿econd quite the contrary, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To allow them a thorough <hi>Watering,</hi> leÅ¿t being to take pains to fetch the Water, they afford them not enough. I very well know that diÅ¿creet <hi>Gard'ners</hi> need none of theÅ¿e SteppoÅ¿ite Documents; however, that I may Reconcile them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48210:242"/>
I adhere to my former Opinion, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the Earth to be mingled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Method; That regularly <hi>Watering</hi> twice a Week, at certain times (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during the hot SeaÅ¿ons, the time of Flowring, and pride of Shooting, and ever obÅ¿erving a Mediocrity between two great ones, and RefreÅ¿hing them every eight or ten days only at other times) you will find your Trees in excellent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to their <hi>Waterings:</hi> To which add, That <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> have this of Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to what concerns their Drink, and in which they almoÅ¿t reÅ¿emble Men that are WiÅ¿e, That as they Å¿eldom call for it but when they have Need and are ThirÅ¿ty; to urge them when they do not require it, inÅ¿tead of doing them a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s one does but incommode them. In like manner <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> Å¿ometimes of themÅ¿elves give notice when they have need of being RefreÅ¿h'd; Å¿o as we certainly do them injury when we Water them out of SeaÅ¿on, whereas we do them good in RefreÅ¿hing them when their Leaves becoming lank, and wrap'd together call for help, and give Symptoms that the <hi>Root</hi> is LanguiÅ¿hing for want of MoiÅ¿ture. But that which juÅ¿tifies the CompariÅ¿on farther is, That a Prudent and Skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is never to wait for the Signal from his <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> when he Å¿hould do his Duty, but that when ever he perceives or Å¿uÅ¿pects it (if he be not miÅ¿taken) he be Å¿ure to apply the proper Remedy according to our PreÅ¿cription; but as there are both good and wholÅ¿om RefreÅ¿hments, there are likewiÅ¿e very evil and pernicious ones too. Concerning which I Å¿hall declare what I think, with that Moderation I judge moÅ¿t convenient.</p>

                        <p>Of the Inconveniences which happen to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as well from <hi>Over-Waterings</hi> as from the <hi>Fire</hi> which is made in <hi>Green-HouÅ¿es.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>'TIS eaÅ¿ily perceiv'd, that when too much Water is given <hi>Cas'd Orange-Trees,</hi> there uÅ¿ually enÅ¿ue two great DiÅ¿orders; and as remarkable it is, that one is not Å¿enÅ¿ible of the Evil when it firÅ¿t begins, but the conÅ¿equence makes us feel it at laÅ¿t, when 'tis too late for Remedy.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t DiÅ¿order conÅ¿iÅ¿tsin this, That thoÅ¿e unreaÅ¿onable and frequent Summer-<hi>Watering</hi> AccuÅ¿toming (as one may Å¿ay) the Trees to a CourÅ¿e of Life which though Inconvenient, would nevertheleÅ¿s enable them to Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t, were it to be continued all the Winter long: Their being Å¿o eaÅ¿ily inur'd to all Å¿orts of NouriÅ¿hment, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them this Å¿ingular Advantage. But Å¿ince we find that Å¿uch <hi>Waterings</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mortal to them when the cold Weather comes, we ought to be very Å¿paring, though to avoid one danger (which in effect is of all other the greateÅ¿t) we are apt to fall into another which is not without its great Inconvenience, namely, That of an every Years loÅ¿s of Leaves. Now one cannot Reflect on an Accident Å¿o ungrateful, without concluding it to proceed from the <hi>Roots</hi> not receiving that due NouriÅ¿hment during the Å¿even previous Months of their Confinement, which they us'd to have the five former Months abroad, which needs muÅ¿t check and put a Å¿top to their Natural Activity. This doubtleÅ¿s is the CauÅ¿e that the Leaves finding themÅ¿elves deÅ¿titute of that perpetual Å¿upply of Sap which then they need, are forc'd to forÅ¿ake the Branches, which Naturally and from their Birth produc'd them: And Å¿o not well underÅ¿tanding from what Å¿ource this Evil proceeds we make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Erroneous Conjectures, and have recourÅ¿e to other things which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have not at all Contributed to it, always Å¿uppoÅ¿ing that the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> be not in fault.</p>
                     <p>In the next place (and which indeed is the moÅ¿t Important) Å¿ince the Nature and Quality of the <hi>Shoots</hi> intirely depend upon the Quality of the <hi>Roots,</hi> and theÅ¿e particularly upon that of NouriÅ¿hment. 'Tis certain, That when this is peccant and feeble, the New-born <hi>Roots</hi> muÅ¿t needs be weak and feeble alÅ¿o, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the Sap which they prepare being of an ill ConÅ¿titution, the <hi>Shoots</hi> themÅ¿elves which they produce muÅ¿t needs be Å¿hort and weak, alÅ¿o the Leaves Å¿inall, limber, and often Yellow. Hence it comes to paÅ¿s, that theÅ¿e <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which for want of Å¿ufficient NouriÅ¿hment during Summer are already fall'n Sick, finiÅ¿h (as I may Å¿ay) their LanguiÅ¿hing and MiÅ¿ery, Å¿o Å¿oon as the Cold (which above all things they dread) aÅ¿Å¿aults them: The main Principle of their Natural Strength and Vigour, may poÅ¿Å¿ibly have enabled them to reÅ¿iÅ¿t and Å¿truggle for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48210:242"/>
Å¿ome time againÅ¿t the MiÅ¿chief to which their ill <hi>Culture</hi> has reduc'd them, but when once this little Stock comes to be Å¿pent and exhauÅ¿ted (as at length it will be) they pine Å¿o miÅ¿erably, that for Å¿ome years after one Å¿hall be hardly able to Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and perhaps at laÅ¿t without SucceÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>We have already Å¿aid (and may not improperly repeat here) that it is not from the Material SubÅ¿tance of the Earth the <hi>Roots</hi> Elaborate and CompoÅ¿e the Sap, adminiÅ¿tring NouriÅ¿hment to all the parts of the Tree; it is the Water only, which percolating through the Ground, is Impregnat with part of its Salt, or Å¿ome other qualities wherewith the Earth was endowed: So as if this Earth, whoÅ¿e Salt doubtleÅ¿s is not InexhauÅ¿tible and without end, comes once to be over-diluted by great and frequent WaÅ¿hings, it muÅ¿t needs at laÅ¿t be quite robb'd and depriv'd of all its Salure, and within a Å¿hort time after, the <hi>Roots</hi> finding no more of it in the Water which moiÅ¿tens the Earth, or but very little, they can produce no more new <hi>Shoots</hi> worth any thing; and conÅ¿equently, neither any good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Sap, Branch, Leaves, or Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as doubtleÅ¿s they would do in better Mould moderately moiÅ¿ten'd and refreÅ¿h'd. Whence I conclude (and I think with ReaÅ¿on) That to Water Trees to the purpoÅ¿e, requires more Skill and Prudence than uÅ¿ually appears in the ordinary Conduct of moÅ¿t <hi>Gard'ners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other Å¿ide, by the uÅ¿e of Fire which moÅ¿t of them affect to make in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e, Orange</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees</hi> fall into other very pernicious Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as by long Experience I have Learn'd. The ReaÅ¿on is evident, The Fire is either too great or too Å¿mall. If the latter, the Heat can only affect thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> which are very near it, without any Influence on the farther diÅ¿tant. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If you make it below, and (as commonly they practice it) in Å¿everal places of the Room, neither the Heads (of any height) nor oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ides of Å¿uch as Å¿tand not near, are Å¿enÅ¿ible of it; and in caÅ¿e you make it higher, the under Branches receive no comfort by it. Thus granting it may do Å¿ome good, which I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, 'tis yet certain, that the Fire being little it does but little good, and in few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conÅ¿equently its Benefit is inconÅ¿iderable, or rather none at all.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, If you make a great Fire, as the Nature of Å¿uch a Fire is to dry up that which is MoiÅ¿t, as far as its Heat extends, 'twill doubtleÅ¿s parch and dry both the Bark and Branches of the Trees, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e parts on which the Leaves depend, and conÅ¿equently make them Å¿hrink; Å¿top and obÅ¿truct the Channels and PaÅ¿Å¿ages of the Sap, which Å¿hould always continue moiÅ¿t and open for its free and perpetual IntercourÅ¿e, whilÅ¿t (as above we Å¿aid) 'tis indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably requiÅ¿ite that the Sap do convey continual Supplies both to the Trunk, Branches, Fruit and Leaves, this diÅ¿order elÅ¿e will be Å¿ure to happen, upon the leaÅ¿t Interception of this Supply: Sap, without queÅ¿tion, being to theÅ¿e Å¿ort of Trees what Water is to FiÅ¿hes, and the Air to all TerreÅ¿trial Animals, and even what Foundations are to Buildings, and the Hand is to the Ballance which holds it up, and Å¿uÅ¿pends it in the Air.</p>
                     <p>In all Events this Fire (as PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿peak) Changes, and Dries the Air, and cauÅ¿es a notable Alteration, and has the Å¿ame effect upon it as it commonly has on Water, which Experience tells us being Boil'd, and coming after to be expos'd to the freÅ¿h Air, grows more Å¿uÅ¿ceptible of Cold than 'twas before, and conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿hall Å¿ooner Freeze than that which has never been near any Fire at all: So as to the ImpreÅ¿Å¿ions of Cold in relation to the Air, this Fire (kindled in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e)</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enders the Air more obnoxious and diÅ¿pos'd to receive the Cold which environs it on every part, than that which never was thus alter'd with any Artificial Heat. The Heat of Char-coal, and the like, whether in Å¿ome hidden Stove, or Earthen Pan, though it may perhaps encounter, and hinder Å¿ome Effects of Cold offenÅ¿ive to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, who will receive no more than they need and have a mind to; yet <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> have not that Gift to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h and know the juÅ¿t degree of a Foreign Heat, neceÅ¿Å¿ary to protect them againÅ¿t the rigour of Winter. The truth is, to derive any advantage from Artificial Fire in favour of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> one Å¿hould firÅ¿t underÅ¿tand the juÅ¿t MeaÅ¿ure of the Need which theÅ¿e Trees have of it, whether only to defend them from the Cold, or Å¿o to recover the Heat which they have loÅ¿t, as that afterwards no Infirmity may be the conÅ¿equent of it; but we have not this Sagacity, an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> which has once been attack'd by the FroÅ¿t Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly loÅ¿es its Leaves, remaining Sick and IndiÅ¿pos'd a long time after. In the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, it were neceÅ¿Å¿ary that through the whole extent of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> the Heat were always Uniform and of the Å¿ame Temper, which it neither is nor can be, for it can neither be equal as to its continuance, nor (as PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿peak) perfectly Regular as to its Intention: That is (as all the World has Å¿ufficiently Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48210:243"/>
maintain a conÅ¿tant Heat, and of the Å¿elf Å¿ame Tenor, eÅ¿pecially during the Night, which is the Time that the Cold is moÅ¿t IntenÅ¿e and Penetrating, and when the Gard'ner is commonly faÅ¿t aÅ¿leep; Å¿o as the Fire, which at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or when newly kindled was but moderate, does afterwards IncreaÅ¿e, the Fuel at laÅ¿t being all Å¿pent and conÅ¿um'd, it does either extreamly diminiÅ¿h and abate of its Heat, or is altogether extinguiÅ¿h'd: Such Fire, I affirm therefore creates great DiÅ¿orders in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> Spoiling the <hi>Boughs</hi> that are neareÅ¿t to it, Parching the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and above all, Altering the <hi>Air,</hi> which produces all the Good, and all the MiÅ¿chief, accordingly as 'tis well or ill qualified.</p>
                     <p>My Opinion therefore is, that the very beÅ¿t Expedient for the PreÅ¿ervation of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> thus Inclos'd againÅ¿t the Cold, which is Å¿o funeÅ¿t and deadly to them, were (as we have Å¿hew'd) a good Situation and ExpoÅ¿ure: That the Doors be made of Å¿ufficient ThickneÅ¿s, and exactly Shutting; The Windows very CloÅ¿e, with good <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿is</hi> double, and well Cauk'd; EÅ¿pecially, that the Walls of the HouÅ¿e be SubÅ¿tantial. But in CaÅ¿e the <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory</hi> Å¿hould not have purpoÅ¿ely been built for this PurpoÅ¿e, as now and then it may happen; and that perhaps one is oblig'd to make uÅ¿e of a Room that has been formerly Å¿ome Hall, Cellar, or Stable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as occaÅ¿ion prompts till a Better be made. In Å¿uch exigence; the beÅ¿t way is to build either within, or on the out-Å¿ide (as Å¿hall be found moÅ¿t Convenient) Å¿ome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Wall, of a full foot in thickneÅ¿s, as high, and long as is the old Wall, if you Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it not thick enough; and this Å¿hould be built of good MaÅ¿onry: Or in caÅ¿e of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, one may Cloath an Old Wall with Litter of a dry Dunghill, beating it very cloÅ¿e together as you heap it up; and to the end it may Å¿tand and not Å¿lide down, to drive in Å¿ome Å¿tout quarters of Wood at Competent diÅ¿tances from the Wall about four foot of each other, joyning to the Counter-mure of the Litter.</p>
                     <p>Indeed Å¿uch Litter-Counter-Walls are not Å¿o Å¿ightly and Å¿weet within Doors: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides they will be a Retreat for <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> which may be apt to gnaw and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark the Trees, not Å¿paring the Roots themÅ¿elves: But beÅ¿ides that there are many remedies and ways to deÅ¿troy moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Vermin; They are not Å¿uch deadly and pernicious Enemies to Trees which are Inclos'd, as the <hi>FroÅ¿ts</hi> againÅ¿t which Å¿uch Counter-Walls of Dung are made uÅ¿e of, 'till a more commodious HouÅ¿e can be built: This therefore may Å¿erve to anÅ¿wer the Objection of UnÅ¿ightlineÅ¿s, and ill Odor. I wiÅ¿h no body (who is a Lover of <hi>Orange-Trees)</hi> may be reduc'd to this Extremity; but may have timely prevented it by erecting a good <hi>ConÅ¿ervatory</hi> for this purpoÅ¿e only.</p>
                     <p>But, if notwithÅ¿tanding all theÅ¿e Precautions, we diÅ¿cover the Ice in our IncloÅ¿ure, as 'tis eaÅ¿ily done by hanging a Linnen Rag moiÅ¿tned, or Å¿etting Å¿ome Å¿mall DiÅ¿hes of Water in Å¿everal Places of the HouÅ¿e in the <hi>Winter-</hi>time, and eÅ¿pecially near the Doors and Windows, on the edges of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Boxes,</hi> to obÅ¿erve whether the <hi>FroÅ¿t</hi> (againÅ¿t which one cannot be too Watchful and Jealous) have gotten any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: In this Exigence, the moÅ¿t Infallible Remedy to maintain a Sweet and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Warmth, and which may laÅ¿t as long as one pleaÅ¿es; is to Hang up lighted Flambeaux, or Lamps (which will be Å¿ure to laÅ¿t) either between the <hi>ChaÅ¿Å¿is</hi> againÅ¿t the Windows, if it be there the Cold enters, or near the Doors, or all along the whole HouÅ¿e; taking care the Flame touch none of the Trees, and that the Warmth continue of the Å¿ame Temper, as is eaÅ¿ily done: The Experience of Å¿etting a Å¿mall Wax-Candle lighted in a <hi>Coach</hi> cloÅ¿e Å¿hut up, or of more than one, in a very cloÅ¿e Chamber, may Å¿erve to Confirm this Expedient, as they have me to JuÅ¿tifie this Imagination.</p>

Animals, there are fair ones of all Ages and Growths: But the Truth is, there is nothing more Rare, than to find <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> Å¿uch as are Great and Perfect at the Å¿ame time; whilÅ¿t it is eaÅ¿ie enough among the ordinary and moderate Å¿ort, to meet with Å¿uch as are both Fair, and extreamly handÅ¿om: There are alÅ¿o I confeÅ¿s, very beautiful <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> in <hi>BuÅ¿h</hi> (that is, Å¿uch as produce Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the very bottom) but indeed thoÅ¿e which maintain an upright, Å¿trait and fair <hi>Stem</hi> of about two feet and an half, to Three or Four, or at moÅ¿t, to Five Feet in Height, are much Å¿tatelier, and carry a certain MajeÅ¿ty, much Superior to the <hi>Shrub</hi> and <hi>BuÅ¿h:</hi> I am not much for thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Beam Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿es this Height; tho' they have otherwiÅ¿e their Beauties alÅ¿o, and really Å¿omething in them of Noble and Royal; Å¿uch as would Infinitely become a Plantation without Doors, and in plain Ground: But for the <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>Box,</hi> they would bring with them great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and be nothing Å¿o Commodious, in regard of the difficulty of Carrying and Removing them, the Height and Capacity of the Doors, and Cieling of the ConÅ¿ervatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> from Fifteen to Sixteen Feet, is an handÅ¿om pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for the well entertaining any ReaÅ¿onable and Curious PerÅ¿on's Trees: But for Å¿uch as have HouÅ¿es of Twenty, Twenty two, and Twenty four feet high (as indeed there ought to be) for Trees of Eight, Nine, and Ten feet Stem or above, they ought to have Heads correÅ¿pondent to their Å¿tature, and will require <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> of four and five feet Depth: But I confeÅ¿s theÅ¿e Gyants affright me; there being I fear few PerÅ¿ons that would be at the Expence of Å¿uch Buildings: And indeed hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find we the Gates of Cities of that Altitude: However, they deÅ¿erve due PraiÅ¿e and Encouragement, who in our Days attempt the RaiÅ¿ing Trees of that goodly Stature, Å¿ince we may hope, that as they appear Worthy the CurioÅ¿ity of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t Monarch of the World, Å¿o we Å¿hall Å¿hortly Å¿ee them an Extraordinary Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Gardens.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore to be able to pronounce that the Head of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be) is Endow'd with all the Beauty and AccompliÅ¿hments 'tis capable of, theÅ¿e Å¿ix Conditions are requiÅ¿ite:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That the Head be of a Round Figure, yet Å¿o as it be alÅ¿o large, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pread, and almoÅ¿t flat, approaching in Shape to that of a <hi>MuÅ¿hroom</hi> newly riÅ¿en, or of a <hi>Calott,</hi> yet not Affected or nicely Circular, as they uÅ¿e to cut <hi>Myrtles, Tews, Philyria's,</hi> and <hi>Standard-Honey-Suckles, Box,</hi> &amp;c. which appear forc'd and conÅ¿train'd, but of a Natural RoundneÅ¿s, Free and Airy, and without Art, as we commonly Å¿ee grow the <hi>ConÅ¿tantinople-CheÅ¿s-Nut, Lime-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it be Full, without ConfuÅ¿ion within, and not void and hollow as we Affect to have our <hi>Fruit-Trees:</hi> But the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> Heads Å¿hould be furniÅ¿h'd with a pretty number of fair well-fed Branches, almoÅ¿t of an equal Å¿ize, and eaÅ¿ie to be Å¿een and numbred if one be diÅ¿pos'd. This is one of the moÅ¿t principal Conditions of the Beauty of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as it is alÅ¿o the moÅ¿t Rare, whilÅ¿t many do not EÅ¿teem this ConfuÅ¿ion for any great Defect, though I confeÅ¿s it appears to me a great one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Branches which form and compoÅ¿e the Head of the Tree, be Å¿ufficiently and well NouriÅ¿h'd, and Å¿o Å¿trong that their Tops inÅ¿tead of Inclining towards the Earth (as many we find do) erect and hold up their Heads to the Air, with plenty of large and green Leaves; yet Å¿o, as that the longeÅ¿t Branches exceed not half a Foot, Å¿ince if the Boughs Å¿ink down, 'tis a mark they are Å¿o weak that they are not able to RedreÅ¿s themÅ¿elves; and Å¿eeing the new <hi>Shoots</hi> Å¿pring only from the Extremities and Tops of the old ones (whoÅ¿e Situation they naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) it comes to paÅ¿s that all Å¿uch <hi>Shoots</hi> as proceed from thoÅ¿e feeble ones, are yet more feeble, and leÅ¿s able to erect themÅ¿elves, and conÅ¿equently yield a very Ill-favour'd ProÅ¿pect. BeÅ¿ides, If the Leaves be Å¿mall and yellow, 'tis yet a Å¿ign of greater Imbecillity in the Roots (for as much as Naturally this Tree does produce Leaves that are large, green, thick and in plenty) and therefore that they will quickly fall off, and denude the Tree of its genuine Ornament. In Å¿hort, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons of this third Qualification propos'd, are, That if the utmoÅ¿t length be exceÅ¿Å¿ive (as a Foot or more would be) the Leaves not being of above three or four Years abiding on the Branch which bears them (and even for thoÅ¿e a Tree ought to be a very luÅ¿ty one, Å¿ince moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e which we Å¿ee Å¿eldom hang on above a Year or two, and live not beyond three or four) it happens, that coming to drop off in their turns, thoÅ¿e over-long Branches will appear all naked and bare, which is extreamly unÅ¿ightly; therefore, whatever Branch in the Spring of the Year advances above half a Foot, it Å¿hould be nipp'd off and confin'd to that dimenÅ¿ion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48210:244"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth condition requires that the Tree Å¿hould be ready to put forth plenty of fair <hi>Shoots</hi> every Spring Yearly; which if it do not, or that it only produce but Å¿mall and trifling ones, the defect is from the Foot, and the next Year after it will be in danger of loÅ¿ing its Leaf, which Å¿hould be prevented by all means poÅ¿Å¿ible. Now no <hi>Shoots</hi> ought to be accounted fair, but Å¿uch as are of competent length and bigneÅ¿s, and conÅ¿equently (as we Å¿hew'd) able to Å¿uÅ¿tain themÅ¿elves without bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tops; Å¿uch never fail of large and green Leaves, which they keep on from falling, Å¿ince thoÅ¿e which have now perhaps been on for three Years paÅ¿t, coming to drop according to the courÅ¿e of Nature, there is Å¿till a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of thoÅ¿e of the two former Years, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e of the current and preÅ¿ent Year, to maintain the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Decoration of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis required that our <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> produce (not an Infinite, but) a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable quantity of Flowers, fair, great, long, large and weighty, Å¿uch as give pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age of goodly Fruit: On which I am to AdvertiÅ¿e, That <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> do every Spring produce two Å¿orts of Flowers, one whereof proceeding from the old Wood or <hi>Shoot</hi> of the precedent Year, uÅ¿ually are but Å¿mall and round, and confus'dly plac'd, Å¿o as moÅ¿t of them drop off without knitting; and theÅ¿e firÅ¿t appear in the early Spring. But Woe to that Tree which is over-charg'd with them however the Owner eÅ¿teem of it; their Beauty will Å¿oon paÅ¿s, and the end of it be unproÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing.</p>
                     <p>I foreÅ¿ee that my Sentiments herein will not be very Acceptable to every body, divers Curious PerÅ¿ons fancying that an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> can never bring forth too many Flowers; but for all that, I adventure to declare it a great MiÅ¿take, which Time and Experience will Cure them of. I Å¿hould willingly be of their Opinion, were it poÅ¿Å¿ible to Reconcile that large quantity of thoÅ¿e Å¿ort of Flowers with thoÅ¿e other Conditions, which indeed I eÅ¿teem a great deal more, the Beauty of the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thoÅ¿e being but for one Fortnight, whereas the other are the Beauty of the whole Year about, and therefore to be preferr'd.</p>
                     <p>The other Flowers of the <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> Å¿pring out at the tops of the Shoots of that Year, and commonly with thoÅ¿e tranÅ¿cendent Qualities we have enumerated; nor come they in CluÅ¿ters and confus'dly, but are of Å¿ubÅ¿tance long, and well fed, and do not appear 'til the end of <hi>June,</hi> or beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and of which we cannot have too many.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth RequiÅ¿ite to the Beauty of the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> is its being free of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, DuÅ¿t and Sullage, and eÅ¿pecially of <hi>Bugs</hi> and <hi>PiÅ¿mires.</hi> We have Å¿hew'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready how this may eaÅ¿ily be compaÅ¿s'd at the beginning of this TreatiÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Having thus propos'd the Idea which I have form'd of a Beautiful-headed <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially Å¿uppoÅ¿ing they have not fail'd in performing all the Directions I have given concerning the <hi>Root,</hi> in order to its <hi>Shooting</hi> well (upon which all the reÅ¿t depends) there remains to inquire what there is more to be done to arrive at this Idea, whether in Relation to Å¿uch Trees as have not yet begun their Heads, and are but newly <hi>In-Cas'd,</hi> or in ReÅ¿pect to others, which have never received any AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance or (as one may Å¿ay) Education at all.</p>
                     <p>And FirÅ¿t, As to the roundneÅ¿s and fullneÅ¿s of the Head, I conceive that having well conÅ¿ider'd and approv'd of it, one Å¿hall eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cover the defects which are repugnant to it, Å¿o as one Å¿hall not endure Å¿o much as the Å¿ight of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> unfurniÅ¿h'd in the middle, flat at one of the Å¿ides, over long on another, or riÅ¿ing in Pyramid like a <hi>CypreÅ¿s,</hi> or with Branches groveling on the Earth like the tardy and late-bearing <hi>Cherry-Tree:</hi> You will not (I Å¿ay) be able to Å¿uffer the leaÅ¿t Bough to Å¿tart out beyond its Fellows, disfiguring the roundneÅ¿s which is now a forming.</p>
                     <p>And Å¿o for the Å¿upply of Vacuities (which Å¿eldom is the Fault of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that on the contrary grow Naturally full, confus'd and irregular, as do moÅ¿t Å¿orts of other <hi>Fruit-Trees)</hi> one is to conÅ¿ider, that this defect either proceeds from no other CauÅ¿e than from the Ignorance, and ill handling of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or that Å¿ome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and middle Branches may unhappily, or unwarily have been broken. In either of theÅ¿e CaÅ¿es, there's nothing to be done but to endeavour the preÅ¿erving of thoÅ¿e other Branches which Nature will not fail of putting forth if the Tree be vigorous; or if it be not in condition (whilÅ¿t perhaps it is become Sick and LanguiÅ¿hing) you muÅ¿t Å¿peedily reÅ¿olve to Lop off, and Abate one or two of the biggeÅ¿t Branches near to the middle, being certain of its Å¿oon producing others, Å¿ufficient to furniÅ¿h and repair this blemiÅ¿h in a little time.</p>
                     <p>As to a Tree defective in roundneÅ¿s, or that you find one of its Å¿ides too flat, it may proceed from a double CauÅ¿e; as either from Å¿ome Accident of a Boughs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48210:244"/>
being broken, which Å¿hould naturally have Contributed to that comely Figure, and then the remaining Å¿ound part of the Branch muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be Cut off, as far as to that very place which the DiÅ¿cretion of an Able <hi>Gard'ner</hi> judges may beÅ¿t Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Defect: Or elÅ¿e it Å¿prings from where an Ignorant <hi>Gardner</hi> may have Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Å¿ome one or more Libertine great Branches to Å¿hoot uncontroll'd, and to have Robb'd and receiv'd all the NouriÅ¿hment from the ReÅ¿t; whilÅ¿t the moÅ¿t Å¿eeble parts remain as it were Abandon'd: whereas, he Å¿hould have Nipp'd off thoÅ¿e Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitants, at their very firÅ¿t appearing, and Reduc'd them to Order, or elÅ¿e have Cut them Å¿hort the enÅ¿uing <hi>Spring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Branches thus Nipp'd off, or diÅ¿creetly Cut, would not have fail'd to Å¿prout from all about the Tops Å¿everal New Branches, and become a Round and handÅ¿ome Tree: Nay for the RedreÅ¿s of Å¿uch a Fault (a great one in my Opinion) one is Å¿ometimes forc'd to proceed to an Operation which at firÅ¿t appears a little Cruel; Namely, to the <hi>Amputation</hi> of all thoÅ¿e Wanderers, and conÅ¿train the <hi>Whole-Tree</hi> to begin a new the forming of that agreeable RoundneÅ¿s, as Å¿hall be thought moÅ¿t Convenient, and which commonly reaches to that feeble part of the Tree: Or elÅ¿e one muÅ¿t begin upon the very Tops and Summity of thoÅ¿e eÅ¿caped Branches, provided there be any likelihood of bringing it to a Beautiful Shape, in which CaÅ¿e, one is to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all thoÅ¿e Å¿mall and Infirm ones that Å¿tand in the way:</p>
                     <p>If the Figure of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> be diÅ¿agreeable by being too long Å¿ided; you have no more to do, than to Cut away, and abate all that part which grows out of due Rank, and Å¿trangles beyond its bound: The Å¿ame is to be done to the Pointed, and over Tapering Trees, till you have reduc'd them to that Globular and deÅ¿irable Figure a little Flatted at the Crown.</p>
                     <p>But in CaÅ¿e that moÅ¿t of the Branches bend down their Tops, it proceeds from want of Å¿trength; elÅ¿e they all of them naturally Å¿uÅ¿tain themÅ¿elves upright, if of Å¿ufficient SubÅ¿tance to Å¿upport the burden of the Leaves: Now this defect of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour Å¿ometimes Å¿prings for want of wholeÅ¿ome NouriÅ¿hment, and now and then from the Superfluous number of Branches, which require to be fed according to the vigour of the Root, be it Great, or Small; Å¿ince its Strength can reach but a determin'd point: The <hi>Gard'ner</hi> therefore ought to be an Able, and Experienc'd Workman; FirÅ¿t, in knowing how to apply good and proper <hi>Mould</hi> (of which the Chapter above has amply treated) and then (having done his Endeavour as to that particular) to ConÅ¿ider what Weight and Charge his Tree is able to Å¿uÅ¿tain, and accordingly leave no more Branches on than can well be fed, and the <hi>Stem</hi> Å¿upport.</p>
                     <p>When therefore one perceives a Tree to Å¿uffer under this Infirmity, the Branches Growling or over-bending (which happly may not yet proceed from want of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment) one Å¿hould begin to take a great part of thoÅ¿e Branches quite away; Namely, all the Feeble ones, and thoÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially which grow out of Order, and diÅ¿compoÅ¿e the Figure; preÅ¿erving only thoÅ¿e SubÅ¿tantial ones which are found well plac'd.</p>
                     <p>This Operation Å¿hould be perform'd with great diligence, juÅ¿t when the Trees begin to Sprout; and therefore one is to ObÅ¿erve, that commonly, as to <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> (for it does not fall out the Å¿ame in moÅ¿t other Trees) from whatever part a Branch does IÅ¿Å¿ue, be it from the Body of the Tree, or from Å¿ome other Bough, 'tis ever accompanied with a Second, and not Å¿eldom with a Third; upon which this Reflection is to be made; That in caÅ¿e the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is divided into Two or Three Channels, were all reduc'd to One alone, namely to a Å¿ingle Branch; that one Branch partaking of the greater Portion, would doubtleÅ¿s be the moÅ¿t Å¿trong and vigorous, and capable of Erecting its Head, and Supporting all its Weight.</p>
                     <p>Now the AÅ¿Å¿embling and Uniting this divaricated Juice to one <hi>Channel,</hi> is Å¿oon learn'd and done, by pulling off the Å¿mall Shoots, and notably diminiÅ¿hing of their number, not leaving above one in a place, Namely, the handÅ¿omeÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t Commodious, in order to the deÅ¿ired Figure propoÅ¿ed. This pulling off the <hi>Shoots</hi> Å¿hould be done as Å¿oon as poÅ¿Å¿ibly, that the <hi>Sap</hi> Å¿pend not it Å¿elf unprofitably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the Faulty Branches to be taken away; but finding its accuÅ¿tomed paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age not only Å¿topp'd and intercepted, but another (which is near it) open, may flow in plentifully there, and render it a conÅ¿iderable increaÅ¿e of NouriÅ¿hment, and as Certain of SucceÅ¿s, as the Execution of it is EaÅ¿ie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48210:245"/>
'Tis Å¿ufficiently Evident, that it were much better not to have above one Å¿ingle good and Å¿ubÅ¿tantial <hi>Shoot,</hi> than two or three moderate ones; One Å¿trong, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and conÅ¿equently moÅ¿t Beautiful <hi>Shoot,</hi> Å¿hall furniÅ¿h infinitely beyond all thoÅ¿e trifling ones which can produce but poor and deÅ¿picable <hi>Foliage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It often fortunes, that Å¿uch a Branch, Å¿o NouriÅ¿h'd with the portion of three or four, will in a Å¿hort time become of great length, and much exceed its Neighbours, to the ruine of our Propos'd <hi>Symmetrie:</hi> Wherefore, in this CaÅ¿e, 'tis adviÅ¿able to Nip it off, and not permit it to exceed a Foot in length. To which Standard and Size, I would willingly Reduce the <hi>Shoots</hi> of all our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that by this means, their Heads growing at leaÅ¿t a Foot large in Diameter every Year (never above) that is half a Foot on each part or Å¿ide round the <hi>Stem</hi> (I do not mean to ReÅ¿train its growing more in height, half a Foot Å¿hall Å¿uffice me) One may be Contented with this Annual Augmentation for the Diameter; Å¿ince it fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es an IncreaÅ¿e of Six Feet, in Six or Seven Years, which is very ConÅ¿iderable if one be able to attain it, as I doubt not but the <hi>OrangiÅ¿t</hi> will AccompliÅ¿h doing his Duty as he Å¿hould, or the Fault is in the <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in CaÅ¿e that all you thus Nip off, Å¿oon after produce new <hi>Shoots,</hi> and that in reaÅ¿onable number, well plac'd, for the equally furniÅ¿hing the whole Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your <hi>Orange-Tree;</hi> 'Tis happy for you, and Å¿hould be CheriÅ¿h'd, Å¿ince it does not often happen: And therefore if there be but few Branches, that having been Å¿o Nip'd put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>orth new <hi>Shoots</hi> at their Tops, you Å¿hould Å¿pare none of them but Å¿uch as may Contribute to the Beauty of the Figure; continually plucking off all the Springs of the reÅ¿t: Which if the Lazy or Unskilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> have omitted to do, and what elÅ¿e has lately been directed him, and was to have been done in <hi>Summer</hi> (when thoÅ¿e <hi>Shoots</hi> being extremly Tender and Brittle, knap off eaÅ¿ier than GlaÅ¿s) You muÅ¿t have recourÅ¿e to the <hi>Knife</hi> again, and fall to Cutting when they are now grown Hard, either at the end of <hi>Summer,</hi> before you Å¿hut them up in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> (which is beÅ¿t) or at the <hi>Spring</hi> of the Year, when you bring them forth: For abÅ¿olutely, you muÅ¿t not Indulge any one Branch that grows Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly, diÅ¿gracing the Shape and comely Figure which one Å¿hould always bear in Mind and aim at.</p>
                     <p>The Pruning and Cutting of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> has an advantage, which other Trees have not, Particularly <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> It often happening that a Branch of the <hi>Peach</hi> being cut off, does not Å¿prout at all again, hindred by a certain <hi>Gum</hi> that kills it: But of the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> whatever Branch you cut, or pinch off, if it be a Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tree, Å¿mall or great, it will not fail of re-producing new ones, according to the Å¿trength and ability of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>As to Nipping of the <hi>Orange-Tree;</hi> you Å¿hould never permit any new, long and Å¿traggling Branch upon them, excepting on Å¿uch as have been newly Planted, and that yet have nothing to Å¿hew but the <hi>Stem</hi> only, without any old Branches: 'Tis neceÅ¿Å¿ary that thoÅ¿e Å¿ort of Trees Å¿hould Å¿peedily put forth good and luÅ¿ty <hi>Shoots,</hi> and Å¿uch as being free and without intanglement, may form an Head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the bigneÅ¿s and Å¿tature of the <hi>Stem;</hi> which they would not do, but on the Contrary, produce Å¿ome confuÅ¿ed Å¿light ones, if according to the Rules formerly EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, the vigorous <hi>Shoots</hi> were not pinch'd off Å¿hort.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Summer SolÅ¿tice</hi> is the proper SeaÅ¿on when <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> make their Å¿trongeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t vigorous <hi>Shoot,</hi> Namely the Month of <hi>June;</hi> and 'tis then one Å¿hould be moÅ¿t InduÅ¿trious in Nipping, and taking off the falÅ¿e <hi>Shoots,</hi> and Watering them more than at other times; That is, once or twice a Week, thereby to AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them in this firÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t Action, and to promote the continuance of it, which Å¿ometimes they Redouble conÅ¿iderably towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> and beginning of <hi>AuguÅ¿t:</hi> And therefore the Å¿ame care is to be taken in <hi>June.</hi> But if this exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Second puÅ¿hing, do not appear till towards the expiration of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> or commencement of <hi>September,</hi> they are worth little: The <hi>Shoots</hi> of that SeaÅ¿on will periÅ¿h in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> for want of time to perfect them; and therefore it were beÅ¿t to take them off as Å¿oon as they peep; That the <hi>Sap</hi> which gave them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, may continue in the bodies of the Branches that bare them, and make them the Å¿tronger.</p>
                     <p>So Å¿oon as you perceive any luÅ¿ty Branch left upon a Tree <hi>Re-Cas'd,</hi> that has made no <hi>Shoot</hi> in any part of it, excepting perhaps, a Å¿ome few Å¿mall yellowiÅ¿h and trifling ones, inÅ¿tead of Å¿trong and luÅ¿ty ones; Å¿uch as was expected to break out from the extremities of thoÅ¿e Branches, and Å¿hould have Å¿erv'd to Shape the Tree: Cut them away without any Å¿cruple, even during the Pride of their <hi>Sap.</hi>

ThoÅ¿e which you leave will proÅ¿per much the better.</p>
                     <p>I am alÅ¿o bold to affirm, That 'tis impoÅ¿Å¿ible to have an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> anÅ¿werable to the Idea which I have conceiv'd; unleÅ¿s you take off thoÅ¿e early <hi>Shoots</hi> Å¿o Å¿oon as ever they firÅ¿t begin to puÅ¿h; and eÅ¿pecially from thoÅ¿e Trees which have not as yet attain'd that goodly Head which becomes them: ThoÅ¿e Trees which are left with theÅ¿e Å¿maller <hi>Shoots</hi> on them without this diÅ¿charge, or that it be not finiÅ¿hhd, before the Flowers are paÅ¿t, may indeed produce more Flowers, but never come to be Beautiful Trees.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e are moÅ¿t to be Condemn'd; foraÅ¿much as all the Branches of thoÅ¿e Trees abound with Knots and Bunches, and conÅ¿equently are full of <hi>Buggs,</hi> producing none Å¿ave a few pittiful Flowers: The others diÅ¿cover themÅ¿elves Å¿oon enough (as well as the FirÅ¿t) to Å¿ee themÅ¿elves Å¿tripp'd of theirs, whilÅ¿t they Å¿uffer'd a part of the NouriÅ¿hment to go into, and feed thoÅ¿e Branches which are to be taken away, inÅ¿tead of managing it for thoÅ¿e which are to be preÅ¿erv'd, and would become much fairer, Å¿trong, and well furniÅ¿h'd with goodly Flowers, and Å¿pread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leaves.</p>
                     <p>This pinching off the idle <hi>Shoots,</hi> does not only Contribute to the Rounding, Filling, and extending of the Head of an <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> but likewiÅ¿e gives it all thoÅ¿e other graces and perfections 'tis capable of; It produces fairer and Å¿touter <hi>Shoots,</hi> Å¿trong and able to Å¿uÅ¿tain themÅ¿elves; adorns it with plentiful Leaves, ample and lovely Green; and enables the Tree to put forth abundance of new <hi>Shoots</hi> every <hi>Spring,</hi> and afterward to produce a Å¿ufficient quantity of goodly Fruit; and laÅ¿tly, hinders the increaÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e numerous Swarms of <hi>Buggs</hi> and <hi>Ants</hi> you Å¿ee crawling on the Heads of thoÅ¿e Trees, Å¿o extreamly Bunch'd, and full of Tufted Leaves, and conÅ¿equently preÅ¿erves them in that NeatneÅ¿s and Beauty which is Å¿o Charming.</p>
                     <p>If therefore (always Å¿uppoÅ¿ing a Commodious <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e)</hi> a little Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duÅ¿try inable one to maintain our Trees in this excellent plight, of Shape, Beauty, Strength and SoundneÅ¿s: Is't not evident, that it is no Å¿uch hard and difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to know what is firÅ¿t to be done to Recover, and Å¿tabliÅ¿h thoÅ¿e which happly are deficient in nothing but their Shape and Figure; being otherwiÅ¿e Vigorous and LuÅ¿ty Trees; as alÅ¿o Å¿uch as are of Shape and Figure beautiful enough; but want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿trength and health: and laÅ¿tly, to Recover thoÅ¿e, which labouring under both theÅ¿e Defects together, LanguiÅ¿h and are ready to PeriÅ¿h?</p>
                     <p>Generally, The great diÅ¿order of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> happen to them from theÅ¿e four different CauÅ¿es: FirÅ¿t, from the <hi>In-CaÅ¿ing,</hi> which peradventure was not carefully done, or with improper <hi>Mould;</hi> or for want of Renewing in due time. Secondly, from Å¿ome defect in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> its being over-Heated with Fire; or from the Cold or too much MoiÅ¿ture. Thirdly, it may proceed from Without, as by <hi>Hail,</hi> Impetuous <hi>Winds,</hi> or Å¿ome other unforeÅ¿een Accident. And LaÅ¿tly, from their being ill and unskilfully <hi>Prun'd</hi> and <hi>Cut,</hi> or perhaps too unmercifully: AlÅ¿o from <hi>over-Watering</hi> without neceÅ¿Å¿ity, or neglect of due RefreÅ¿hment during the Months of <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> TheÅ¿e are in my Opinion the principle CauÅ¿es of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> being reduc'd many times to a miÅ¿erable Condition.</p>
                     <p>That which many <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are Å¿o afraid of, and does not a little trouble them, is, That to Remedy theÅ¿e Defects, they are often neceÅ¿Å¿itated to have recourÅ¿e to the Severity of Abating and Cutting off both the Head and Foot of their Trees: Which Operation, very few Å¿ave the skilful in theÅ¿e matters, are capable of, and all the World are ready to Condemn at firÅ¿t Å¿ight, how well Å¿oever it be perform'd: But however, we hope, the Curious, truly knowing and Experienc'd will Approve of it, and are certain that the SucceÅ¿s will JuÅ¿tifie it, though it indeed require Å¿ome time.</p>
                     <p>To Commence firÅ¿t with the Roots of a <hi>Sick Orange,</hi> or <hi>Lemon-Tree</hi> if it has long been <hi>Cas'd,</hi> Å¿o as one may reaÅ¿onably Å¿uÅ¿pect that the Roots are come to Touch the bottom of the <hi>Box,</hi> and Å¿o to receive no NouriÅ¿hment there: One is then to ReÅ¿olve without more ado to take it quite out of the <hi>CaÅ¿e,</hi> and Abate two third parts of the <hi>Clod,</hi> and withall to examine whether the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Clod</hi> be not too <hi>Light;</hi> and if Å¿o, to Water it Å¿ufficiently for three or four Hours before you lift it out; Thus the Earth being well drench'd, the Roots may adhere the faÅ¿ter to it, and you with more eaÅ¿e and aÅ¿Å¿urance take away what you judge Convenient.</p>
                     <p>This is not to be done where you find the <hi>Earth</hi> Å¿o light, exceÅ¿Å¿ive dry, and exhauÅ¿ted as to fall, and crumble away at every touch more than it Å¿hould: But in caÅ¿e it be Å¿ufficiently tenacious and conÅ¿iÅ¿tent to hold, Å¿pare the Pains of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering we Å¿peak of in <hi>New CaÅ¿ing.</hi> If the Trees have not been <hi>Cas'd</hi> above a Year
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48210:246"/>
or Two, and have perhaps been planted too deep and low: You Å¿hould then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine in what Temper the Earth is; as whether too Å¿trong or over light: If the Latter; you muÅ¿t give them an half <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing;</hi> That is, Å¿upply them with as much well prepared, and better condition'd <hi>Mould</hi> as you can, and be careful in the mean time that you neither Å¿hake the Tree, or lay bare its Roots, which would be very prejudicial. But if you find the <hi>Earth</hi> to be over GroÅ¿s and Stiff, or not Å¿ufficient, I hold your beÅ¿t courÅ¿e is to <hi>UncaÅ¿e</hi> it quite, and to abate part of the <hi>Clod</hi> after 'tis well Sob'd and MoiÅ¿tned, and to replace and Å¿et it in again, as already we have taught; Å¿ince in truth, all that can be done about the Head, will be of Å¿mall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, unleÅ¿s you begin firÅ¿t to fecure the Foot, which is the BaÅ¿is and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, and the Å¿ole Architect able to PreÅ¿erve both Head and all the reÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>Having thus perform'd what is due to the Foot, your next work muÅ¿t be about the Head again, and make account that what you'l moÅ¿t Regret, are the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Tops of the Branches, to which hardly any NouriÅ¿hment for a long time has been able to arrive, and accordingly, you'l find them Chang'd and Dry'd exceedingly, either by reaÅ¿on of the diminution of the <hi>Sap</hi> it Å¿elf in the Roots, or that the Head and Branches are charg'd beyond what the Foot is able to Support: Not unlike thoÅ¿e Fountains, which cannot RiÅ¿e to their accuÅ¿tomed height, either from the failure of the Spring or SourÅ¿e, or that the Waters are too much divided and have taken Å¿ome other CourÅ¿e. In this Exigent, you muÅ¿t not only pluck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and cut off the Tops of thoÅ¿e Branches, but do it to the purpoÅ¿e, Å¿ince your own ReaÅ¿on will tell you, that having Treated the Foot as a Sick and Crazy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you Å¿hould not charge it with a greater Burden than it can bear. Now Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing the Tree to be in a languiÅ¿hing Condition (as by its Root appears) and that you have been oblig'd to retrench a conÅ¿iderable part of it: That is, That a great many of thoÅ¿e Agents, which wrought and endeavoured to Maintain the whole Tree, be extreamly diminiÅ¿h'd by theÅ¿e great Abatements and Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Roots, (although for the good and benefit of all) You muÅ¿t reÅ¿olve to do as much proportionably, by diminiÅ¿hing of the Head.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as you expect your Tree Å¿hould likely put forth new Branches at the Tops of the old ones which you have Å¿hortn'd: You Å¿hould carry Å¿uch an <hi>Idea</hi> in your Mind of the Shape and Beauty you would bring it to, that no more new Branches Å¿ucceed in any place, than what may Å¿erve and contribute to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Idea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now according to this <hi>Idea</hi> one ought to be as DiÅ¿creet as Bold: DiÅ¿creet, to Cut and Prune off no more than is neceÅ¿Å¿ary; Bold, to Å¿pare no unprofitable Branches. In a word, one Å¿hould be Compleat MaÅ¿ter of the Operation, and proceed CouragiouÅ¿ly and without heÅ¿itation: He Å¿hall elÅ¿e work with a Trembling Hand, in fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blam'd for having been too free with his <hi>Knife,</hi> and cut too much; and by this means falling into the common and contrary Error of not Cutting enough at firÅ¿t, be at laÅ¿t reduc'd to a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿till Cutting more for two or three Years Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ively, by which a great deal of Time's loÅ¿t that one Å¿hall afterwards repent of.</p>
                     <p>Not but that however Skilful and dextrous one be in Pruning, one Å¿hall now and then find Å¿ome Tops of cut Branches to die without putting forth any <hi>Shoots</hi> at all, eÅ¿pecially among the Sick and long diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed Trees; Å¿o as one Å¿hall be forc'd to cut them again lower, and that immediately as Å¿oon as ever one finds that there's nothing to be hop'd for or expected, as you'l know by a <hi>DryneÅ¿s,</hi> accompanied with a certain <hi>BlackneÅ¿s,</hi> or Å¿ome <hi>Cleft,</hi> and then you'l never be in danger of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for having abated too much.</p>

Branches of the Years before, they are to be looked on but as falÅ¿e Money, which makes a fair Å¿hew indeed, and nothing elÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>I muÅ¿t here acquaint you, that it is not with <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as with other Fruits which come from the <hi>Kernel</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> as to what concerns all Å¿orts of Branches: For InÅ¿tance, ThoÅ¿e great Boughs which we call <hi>FalÅ¿e Wood,</hi> are commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and hurtful to <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> Indeed, on whatever part we find them to grow, we ought inÅ¿tantly to make War againÅ¿t them, and Cut them off, as very Å¿eldom producing Fruit, which is the thing we principally Å¿eek from thoÅ¿e Trees, and therefore Spare and CheriÅ¿h with great Care the Å¿mall and feeble Branches: But as to the <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> the chief thing we affect, is to have them of a beautiful and elegant Shape, that they appear full of Vigour, as well by their <hi>Leaves</hi> as the <hi>Shoots</hi> they make, without being much concerned about the <hi>Flowers,</hi> which commonly they are furniÅ¿h'd with in too great quantity: Hence it is, that we Å¿ave and Å¿pare all the great and Å¿ubÅ¿tantial Branches we can, even thoÅ¿e which in our <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> they call <hi>Water-Bows,</hi> or <hi>FalÅ¿e-Wood;</hi> provided that both the one and the other be well plac'd: In effect, they are thoÅ¿e only which are able to put out others as fair, and as many as we have need of, and conÅ¿equently to produce large and ample Leaves, and as fair and goodly <hi>Flowers</hi> as one would deÅ¿ire.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiÅ¿s here, that for the ConÅ¿olation of the Curious, I give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the firÅ¿t Shoots which puÅ¿h out at the Tops of the old Branches of thoÅ¿e Trees that have been <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ed</hi> whilÅ¿t they were Sick: I Å¿ay, That theÅ¿e new Shoots, far from being Å¿ound and Å¿trong, are themÅ¿elves very Sick and near their end. But let not this trouble you, they commonly reÅ¿emble Water that firÅ¿t runs through the Pipe of a Fountain newly made, which comes foul and duty, as bringing along with it the filth and Å¿ullage of the Ground and Place it paÅ¿Å¿es through; neither is the Pipe clean at firÅ¿t 'til it cleanÅ¿e it Å¿elf, the pure new Water of the SourÅ¿e, aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by the Wind, chaÅ¿es the filth before it; after which it continues to run perfectly clear. In like manner the Shoots of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> that are Sick, are YellowiÅ¿h and Languid, becauÅ¿e its Branches retain nothing in them Å¿ave the Dregs, and Å¿mall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of a Morbific and Tainted Sap, riÅ¿ing from the long DiÅ¿eas'd and Infected Roots; and therefore you cannot reaÅ¿onably expect that Å¿uch a Tree Å¿hould make any new, Å¿trong and vigorous Shoots, large and Verdant Leaves, 'til it produce new and Å¿ound Roots, by having the old ones cut away, and an application of new and Å¿ound Earth at its <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing,</hi> with good Government and Culture. 'Tis obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that what proceeds even from the faireÅ¿t new Roots, come ordinarily at the foot, and underneath the firÅ¿t yellow Å¿ick ones; and which from the Å¿ole Effort of the Rarefaction of the Spring, have been immediately produc'd independently from the new Roots. But theÅ¿e laÅ¿t Shoots which come out below theÅ¿e, near the Body of the Tree, proceed from the Operation of the new Roots, which acting their part in their freÅ¿h and new good Earth (given them at their <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing)</hi> prepare good and wholÅ¿om Sap, and conÅ¿equently produce fair and goodly Shoots.</p>
                     <p>Now Å¿uch newly <hi>Re-Cas'd</hi> Trees, are Å¿ometimes a great many years e'r they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing, Å¿o as one may fitly compare them to Å¿ome Animals, that having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a long time upon unwholÅ¿om Food, find it very difficult to Recover when they come to that which is better; and it Å¿eems as the Stomach, MuÅ¿cles, Bowels <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of theÅ¿e Creatures are Å¿hrunk up by Famine and Want: So the Skin which Clothes and InveÅ¿ts the Stems and Roots (the Seat of the Principle of the Life of <hi>Orange-Trees)</hi> grows hard, and by this means, the Heat which Å¿hould Revive, Excite and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate this Vital Spring, which puts all into Action (and Animates and Awakens the old Roots to begin to Act a new) is not able to reach them, and to Rarifie the old torpent and Å¿luggiÅ¿h Sap, and Mollifie the dry Bark, for the paÅ¿Å¿age of the new Roots to which it Å¿hould give Birth.</p>
                     <p>But albeit Å¿uch newly <hi>Cas'd</hi> Trees remain a long time without Action, as being in a manner quite Stupified, one is not yet quite to deÅ¿pair of them, Å¿o long as there's any appearance of Green in them, for I have known Å¿ome of them three or four years without putting forth Å¿o much as one Shoot, and yet afterwards do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                     <p>MoÅ¿t Å¿ort of Trees regularly do Å¿ooner put forth new Shoots than new Root (as we have Å¿hewed in our TreatiÅ¿e of <hi>Plants)</hi> but <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Spring Å¿ooner at the Root than in the Branches, and in more abundance. One may know as to both theÅ¿e effects, that when they grow in the Roots, they produce new Shoots, of which if any dye after they have begun to Shoot, 'tis a Å¿ign that the new Root does alÅ¿o periÅ¿h, tho' it Å¿eldom happens.</p>

'Tis likewiÅ¿e to be remembred, that if upon the old Branches of the Trees we Å¿peak of, new ones Å¿pring out in Å¿everal places, and the faireÅ¿t of them puÅ¿h in thoÅ¿e parts that are neareÅ¿t the Body of the Tree, one Å¿hould bring them as near one another as is poÅ¿Å¿ible, and abandoning all the reÅ¿t, follow and promote this Natural Vigour whereÅ¿oever it Å¿hews it Å¿elf.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e it is not at all neceÅ¿Å¿ary to AdvertiÅ¿e you to cover over the Wounds and Scars of the Amputations you have made in thoÅ¿e Å¿trong bigger Branches or Stems, with Wax which is prepar'd; this one never fails of, and Careful <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are diligent to obÅ¿erve it: I wiÅ¿h they were as InduÅ¿trious in the reÅ¿t of what belongs to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi> This prepar'd Wax protects the Wound againÅ¿t the Heat and Ardour of the Sun, and is Compos'd of a very Å¿mall quantity of Oil mingled with new Yellow Bees-Wax, melted and brought to Å¿uch a temper as makes it eaÅ¿ie to be handled and Å¿pread. The Apothecaries (at <hi>Paris)</hi> commonly Å¿ell it ready made, and for the better Å¿how, Colour it with Å¿ome cheap Red, Green or Blue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is more than needs.</p>
                     <p>Having thus Å¿aid all that I think needful concerning the <hi>Re-CaÅ¿ing</hi> of Sick <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> it remains to give Å¿ome Directions about thoÅ¿e, that being Å¿ound and Å¿trong, may have been batter'd and Å¿poil'd by Hail and Winds, or other unexpected Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: But this operation is nothing Å¿o terrible and Å¿evere as what we have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿crib'd a little while ago, the greateÅ¿t miÅ¿chief happening commonly among the Leaves, which the Hail may have jagg'd and mangled, whilÅ¿t the Roots (which are the moÅ¿t Important) Å¿uffer nothing which obliges one to New <hi>CaÅ¿e</hi> them. On this Accident one needs only to Strip the Leaves off, and if any Shoot be broken or bruis'd, to Cut it off beneath the place; and in caÅ¿e one finds that one Å¿ide is more broken than the other (which may Disfigure the Tree) Å¿pare not to Cut, and Trim the other unhurt Å¿ide as much, for it being a vigorous Tree (as it to be Å¿uppos'd) you will quickly Å¿ee it Recover: But if it be a Sick and LanguiÅ¿hing Tree, the MiÅ¿chance will prompt one the Å¿ooner to <hi>Re-CaÅ¿e</hi> it.

                     <p>THE Title of this Chapter is not Å¿o long, as the Matter and Subject of it will be Å¿uccinct and Å¿hort: Not but that one might perplex it with Å¿ome Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent difficulties; As whether I Å¿hould firÅ¿t begin to Å¿peak of what were to be done at the Bringing out the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> or at their Carrying into the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e-</hi>Since the Bringing of them out, Å¿uppoÅ¿es they firÅ¿t were Carried in; and their being Carried in, that whether one had them by SucceÅ¿Å¿ion, or New PurchaÅ¿e and AcquiÅ¿ition, they already had been Å¿et Abroad, and afterwards brought In: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that Probleme, whether were FirÅ¿t, the <hi>Egg</hi> or the <hi>Chick?</hi> But as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Point is of no very great Importance, I Å¿hall leave it to the DeciÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e who are at LeiÅ¿ure, and would make themÅ¿elves Merry.</p>
                     <p>Returning then to my Subject and Å¿uppoÅ¿ing, that as to the Removing and TranÅ¿port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Boxes</hi> of the Middle and Å¿maller Size, every body knows 'tis done by <hi>Wheel-Barrows,</hi> or Å¿trong <hi>Coul-Staves,</hi> which with good <hi>Hocks</hi> take hold on the Bottom of the <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> at both Å¿ides, or elÅ¿e with Ropes put about the four Feet, to carry the Great Trees, to place them on low <hi>Truckles</hi> by the help of <hi>Lovers,</hi> and Å¿o draw them along, either by the labour of Men or HorÅ¿es to the Stations appointed for them. This Å¿uppos'd, I Å¿ay to the other part of my Contents; That as theÅ¿e Trees affect Warmth, and as from <hi>Mid-May</hi> (when we bring them forth) to <hi>Mid-October</hi> (when we Å¿hut them up) which is the whole time of their ExpoÅ¿ure, they do well enough in what place Å¿oever you Å¿et them, provided they enjoy the Sun,

at leaÅ¿t a good part of the day: So they are moÅ¿t happily plac'd if near a Wall, Wood, or Grove to protect them from the North. BeÅ¿ides, this Situation being from the end of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> to the time of carrying into the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> is of all the reÅ¿t moÅ¿t convenient for them, as defending them from the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>WeÅ¿tern</hi> Winds, which about that SeaÅ¿on blow, and commonly diÅ¿order and exceedingly ruffle our <hi>In-Cas'd</hi> Trees: So as if one had the Convenience, it were to be wiÅ¿h'd, that after they had been expos'd to the <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> during the Months of <hi>May, June, July</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> (which in effect, are the moÅ¿t favourable Situations for them at firÅ¿t bringing out of the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e)</hi> You might afterwards expoÅ¿e them to the <hi>North</hi> till Mid-<hi>October,</hi> when it is time to carry them in.

                     <p>As to the Time of Carrying in, and Bringing out theÅ¿e Trees, every body knows that as they dread nothing Å¿o much as Cold, they are to be protected from that, where-ever it Invades and threatens them. Now the Nights Å¿eldom fail of being Cold and dangerous till about the Full Moon of <hi>April,</hi> or towards the Eighth, Tenth, or Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> when you may boldly bring them forth: EÅ¿pecially if there be any appearance of Rain during that Full-Moon: But if on the Contrary, the Sharp and Cold Winds continue, have patience a while, till the Weather come to be more favourable.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Nights begin to be Cold near the fifteenth of <hi>October,</hi> which is your juÅ¿t time of Retiring them into the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t to bring them Å¿o near it, that in caÅ¿e the SeaÅ¿on prove very fair, you may Å¿uÅ¿pend the carrying them in for a few days; for as long as you find the Weather at all Inviting, it does the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> good to enjoy the freÅ¿h Air; EÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e <hi>Shoots</hi> grow Å¿till in Length: But as Å¿oon as ever the Wind Changing menaces Cold, haÅ¿ten them to Covert as Å¿peedily as conveniently you can.</p>
                     <p>I have been particularly Cautious at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> not to bring them forth (as I noted) till the Full Moon of <hi>April</hi> be paÅ¿t; becauÅ¿e commonly we are till then in danger of FroÅ¿ts: And I take care that the Air begins to be very Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Temperate, eÅ¿pecially if there be Å¿hew of a warm and gentle Shower, which if it happen, I often reÅ¿olve to bring them forth before Mid-<hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is certain, that however Å¿ome <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> give Signs, and Å¿eem (as one may Å¿ay) Impatient to be at Liberty, by the <hi>Shoots</hi> they begin to put out in the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e,</hi> and would undoubtedly be much better abroad in the Sweet and more benigne Air, than in that which has been pent up, and is Colder by reaÅ¿on of Å¿o long abÅ¿ence of the Sun. Yet Å¿ince the FroÅ¿t but of one Å¿ingle Night, may extreamly prejudice them, parch many of their Leaves, and ruin the Tops of the tender new <hi>Shoots;</hi> I perÅ¿wade you to have a very Å¿pecial Regard to the Temper and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the SeaÅ¿on, and that rather than Hazard them, to defer their ExpoÅ¿ure, though it be a little late, than at all too Å¿oon. In a favourable Year, Warm, and Showry one may do well to bring them Å¿ooner out: But in a Dry, Cold, and Windy Year be not over-haÅ¿tly of ExpoÅ¿ing them, and even in Places that are low, you had need yet to be more Å¿crupulous, than in the higher and more Elevated: BecauÅ¿e commonly, the free Air, and the Å¿mall Breezes Å¿pring there, the FroÅ¿ts are leÅ¿s to be apprehended.</p>
                     <p>Now as a kind and gentle Shower were to be deÅ¿ired at the time of their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; above all, that their Leaves might be WaÅ¿h'd and Cleans'd from the duÅ¿t contracted in the HouÅ¿e: For the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿on, one Å¿hould be glad of Å¿uch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shower a little before we carry them in to cleanÅ¿e them of the DuÅ¿t gotten on them Abroad. But not that I CounÅ¿el you to Retire them whilÅ¿t it actually Rains, leÅ¿t the Sob'd Leaves, Å¿hut up wet, Å¿hould Å¿oon become Å¿oul and Å¿qualid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by the DuÅ¿t Å¿ettling on them there: However you muÅ¿t Remember to give them one plentiful Watering, Å¿o Å¿oon as you have Rang'd and Plac'd them in the HouÅ¿e, as was directed you in the Eighth Chapter, wherein we have copiouÅ¿ly Å¿poken of RefreÅ¿hments to be applied whilÅ¿t Abroad.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Repeat here, That as great Care is to be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Cold from piercing into the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e:</hi> So nor Å¿hould there be leÅ¿s, for the duly opening the Windows when the Sun Å¿hines; and the preÅ¿erving them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e from <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice:</hi> But of this alÅ¿o, we have Å¿poken in the Chapter of the Qualifications of a good <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e.</hi>

There only now Remains to Caution, That there be Å¿ome Å¿pace left between the <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> Walk and the <hi>CaÅ¿es;</hi> as well to keep their Branches from touching the Walls and being Å¿poil'd, as for commodiouÅ¿ly paÅ¿Å¿ing to ViÅ¿it and Water the Trees from time to time if occaÅ¿ion be: Moreover, that if your <hi>Green-HouÅ¿e</hi> be a very ample one, Å¿o as to contain a double Rank of Trees, Ornamentally and with Symmetry all your other Plants (Å¿o as to leave an Alley in the middle, and enjoy a graceful Walk between them) it will be worth your ConÅ¿ideration how to do it, Å¿o as to EmbelliÅ¿h the Place with Å¿everal other <hi>VaÅ¿as,</hi> and Pots of Flowers of the SeaÅ¿on, by placing them about them, or plunging them in the Ground, which would grace and become the Front of the Door, by Å¿etting the leÅ¿Å¿er Trees and Shrubs above the Greater, and by RaiÅ¿ing alÅ¿o the Greater on Blocks as on Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>PiedeÅ¿tales,</hi> Å¿o as to hide the Naked Walles (and the Blocks themÅ¿elves too) with <hi>Pots</hi> and little <hi>Boxes:</hi> Thus will the Room appear full and aboundantly FurniÅ¿hed: The <hi>Lemons, Limes, JeÅ¿Å¿amines, Myrtles, Laurel Trees, LentiÅ¿es</hi> and Å¿ome <hi>Cherry-Laurels,</hi> and a World of other <hi>Simples</hi> properly enter into the Ornament, and the variety of <hi>Foliage</hi> Rejoyces and Recreates one marvellouÅ¿ly. But for the <hi>Pome-Granate</hi> and <hi>RoÅ¿e-Laurel-Trees</hi> (looÅ¿ing their Leaves Å¿o Å¿oon) they are not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, as neither are the Å¿mall Sharp-pointed gray Leaves of that other Shrub, which diÅ¿parage our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> and diÅ¿grace the reÅ¿t of the verdant <hi>Theatre.</hi>

                     <p>I would likewiÅ¿e if PoÅ¿Å¿ible, that in bringing them Abroad, which were Å¿o well ranged within, they Å¿hould be Å¿et and diÅ¿pos'd in as graceful a Figure without, for the Decoration of the Place they are to <hi>Summer</hi> in; and above all, if it might be Å¿o Martial'd as agreeably to Å¿urprize the Eye, by making them appear in greater number than they really are: And now I think there has enough been Å¿aid, concerning <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> their Flowers, Leaves, and <hi>Shoots;</hi> Let us now Å¿peak a Word or two of the Fruits, Å¿uch as are deÅ¿irable; and how long they Å¿hould hang upon the Trees and when to Gather them off?</p>

                     <p>There are <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> that bear Fruit with extraordinary groÅ¿s and thick Rinds, which have but very little Juice, and others, whoÅ¿e Skin is horny and knobb'd, as are the <hi>Bigarades:</hi> And laÅ¿tly, Å¿ome which are endued with a Sweet, thin and delicate Rind.</p>

                     <p>SINCE it is certain that <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees</hi> do Naturally grow Abroad in the open Field and plain Earth in Warm and Temperate Countries; and that it is by Art alone we RaiÅ¿e and bring them up in <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>CaÅ¿es</hi> in Climates obnoxious to Å¿evere Winters: It needs muÅ¿t follow, That theÅ¿e kind of Trees are more diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed to Thrive in the FirÅ¿t way of <hi>Culture,</hi> and where their <hi>Roots</hi> have free Å¿cope and Liberty to receive abundance of NouriÅ¿hment on every Å¿ide, than by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Artificial Way; where the Å¿ame <hi>Roots</hi> being Reduc'd to a Narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿s, ImpriÅ¿on'd as it were, and Surrounded with <hi>Air</hi> capable of Å¿poiling them, attain it but in very Å¿mall proportion.</p>

                     <p>IF you look upon Fruit-Trees in the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they are diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled of the Ornaments of there Fruits and Leaves, and when there appears no Å¿ign of Life in them, as alÅ¿o upon Å¿uch as are newly Planted, you wou'd take them for dead Trunks, or Poles, rather than Live Trees; both of them Å¿eem to have Å¿o perfectly loÅ¿t the Principle of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> that there appears not the leaÅ¿t hopes they Å¿hould ever Recover themÅ¿elves.</p>
                     <p>But then if you look upon them again in the beginning of the <hi>Spring,</hi> when both the Old and the Young ones begin on all Å¿ides, either to BloÅ¿Å¿om or Bud, or put forth <hi>Cions,</hi> you wou'd think they were either performing a kind of ReÅ¿urrection, or that they were not really the Å¿ame we lately Å¿aw in Å¿o deplorable a Condition; and wherein we Å¿hall firÅ¿t conÅ¿ider them.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e as well as many other things, wou'd doubtleÅ¿s be very Surprizing to us, if they were not common in the ordinary CourÅ¿e of Nature, and if thoÅ¿e continual Miracles were not become Å¿o familiar to us; though when a Man Å¿eriouÅ¿ly conÅ¿iders them, he cannot but be much AbaÅ¿h'd at his own Ignorance, and very deÅ¿irous by all means poÅ¿Å¿ible to find out the CauÅ¿es, and the Manner of Å¿uch Alterations.</p>
                     <p>And this Particular affords us Matter for two Nice and Weighty Enquiries: The one is, Whence this CeÅ¿Å¿ation of Action proceeds, which makes the Trees all on a Å¿udden appear Dead when really they are not? And the other is, How that Wonderful Change is Effected, which, a few Months after, puts them into the Å¿ame CourÅ¿e of Acting as before; Å¿o that the Old Trees becoming, in a very little Å¿pace, as Gay as ever, and the Young ones, as it were after their Example, Shooting out Roots at the one end, and Branches at the other, plainly Å¿hew, that, quite contrary to what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, they Å¿till continued Live Trees? As alÅ¿o how they Å¿hould be always lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Å¿ame viciÅ¿Å¿itudes of Nature: That as <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> make their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Returns, Å¿o they make our Gardens their Theatre, and as often preÅ¿ent us with new Scenes? For theÅ¿e Trees upon the firÅ¿t Nipping FroÅ¿t, Return to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿ame <hi>DeÅ¿olate</hi> Condition from which we lately Å¿aw them Recover themÅ¿elves, but as Å¿oon as ever the Severity of the Weather is over, they, as it were, Conquer and Triumph over their Enemy which had brought them Å¿o very low, and preÅ¿ent us with the Å¿ame Beauty and Agreeable Verdure wherewith they had formerly Charmed our SenÅ¿es.</p>
                     <p>Now the better to RepreÅ¿ent to others the Conceptions I have of theÅ¿e Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Appearances of Trees, I Å¿hall IlluÅ¿trate them by Plain, Vulgar and SenÅ¿ible CompariÅ¿ons.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t then, I imagine an Artificial Tree, of as Å¿olid a Matter as you pleaÅ¿e, of Iron, Å¿uppoÅ¿e, or Copper, and that it Å¿tands upright, exactly reÅ¿embling a real Tree, and having Tubes or PaÅ¿Å¿ages in all parts of it, the greater for the UÅ¿e of the Trunk, and the leÅ¿Å¿er for the Branches and Roots.</p>
                     <p>I imagine further, thoÅ¿e Tubs or PaÅ¿Å¿ages filled either up to the top, or a good way, with Milk.</p>
                     <p>Things thus prepared, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e this Liquor at ReÅ¿t, and in its Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tencies, taking up no more Å¿pace than its ordinary Quantity requires, nor any more at one time than another; but this only Å¿o long as no External Heat comes near the Tubes. For as Å¿oon as ever the Heat of the Fire comes near either the ends, or the middle of the Tree, I perceive the Liquor begin to move, to Rarifie, as the PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿peak, or, as we commonly Å¿ay, to Boil up, and to fill a larger Å¿pace than it did before; Å¿o that if any part of the Tubes was empty, the Liquor Å¿wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as the Heat encreaÅ¿es, fills them up; or if they were full at firÅ¿t, the Liquor diÅ¿charges it Å¿elf at the ends of the Tree. And this it does with Å¿uch force, that if it could find none, it would burÅ¿t the Tubes, and make it Å¿elf a PaÅ¿Å¿age out of a place that was not large enough to contain it.</p>
                     <p>Green Wood put in the Fire, and Å¿ending out a kind of Froth at the end as Å¿oon as ever it begins to Burn, Å¿eems to me an Ocular DemonÅ¿tration of all this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48210:250"/>
Now 'tis certain, that if the Ejected Milky SubÅ¿tance thus Rarified be capable of becoming Å¿olid, it will produce, or rather turn into a kind of New Body, which will not give over growing Å¿o long as more of the Å¿ame Liquor Å¿hall Å¿ucceed in the room of that, which after it has been thus Heated, becomes Å¿olid; but a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿uch Operations will produce a Continuation of Å¿uch Effects.</p>
                     <p>Now by theÅ¿e Tubes I would RepreÅ¿ent the Bark of the Trees, and by the Unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Liquor in them, the Condition of the Sap in Winter, when the Extremity of Cold, which fixes the Motion of the Liquids, and hinders the Natural Effects of Heat, Thickens the Sap, and renders it Å¿o Unactive, that for want of the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Influence of the Suns Heat upon it, it remains Immoveable; that is, without any Appearance of Action.</p>
                     <p>The Fire warming the Tubes, and, through them, the Liquor incloÅ¿ed in them, RepreÅ¿ents the Air and the Earth, which, being in themÅ¿elves warmed, do alÅ¿o in the very Å¿ame manner warm the real Trees.</p>
                     <p>And this I look upon as the Manner and Order of this Wonderful Operation which we Å¿ee performed every <hi>Spring.</hi> The Air is firÅ¿t Heated by the Rays of the Sun, and from it, both the Bark, and the Earth that lyes about the Roots of the Trees receive their Heat, which they immediately Communicate to every part of the <hi>Plant</hi> which they reÅ¿pectively IncloÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the <hi>Sap</hi> which is DiffuÅ¿ed throghout the whole Tree but is eÅ¿pecially Lodged between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Wood,</hi> where it chiefly operates, and where it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, as it were Dead all the <hi>Winter,</hi> having then no motion at all. This <hi>Sap,</hi> I Å¿ay, as Å¿oon as ever it comes to feel the Heat of the Sun in the <hi>Spring,</hi> begins firÅ¿t to move in its Place, and then to Swell and RariÅ¿y, and to require more room than it took up before; and the Hotter the <hi>Air</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> grows, by the EncreaÅ¿ing Heat of the Sun, the more it Rarifies and Exerts it Å¿elf towards all the Branches and Roots of the Tree, that it may get out of that Place where it finds it Å¿elf too cloÅ¿ely confin'd. And thus it begins to enter upon a Å¿tate of Action.</p>
                     <p>But this firÅ¿t Motion or Action, begins to appear at the upper End of the Tree firÅ¿t, thoÅ¿e Parts Heating firÅ¿t, as being moÅ¿t Expos'd to the Heated <hi>Air,</hi> which does nor till Å¿ome conÅ¿iderable time after, reach thoÅ¿e Parts that are fixed in the Earth and conÅ¿equently thoÅ¿e Parts being at GreateÅ¿t DiÅ¿tance from the <hi>Air,</hi> are the LaÅ¿t that are Å¿enÅ¿ible of its Heat.</p>
                     <p>But how far Å¿oever this Agitated <hi>Sap</hi> Reaches, it immediately Å¿hews what it can do, having this wonderful Quality, that it hardens, and grows Å¿olid whereÅ¿oever it makes its PaÅ¿Å¿age out.</p>
                     <p>And indeed this is that which of all others is the moÅ¿t Difficult both to UnderÅ¿tand, and to Explain, whether we take notice of the New Growths, Å¿imply ConÅ¿idered in themÅ¿elves, or their Conjunction with and AdheÅ¿ion to thoÅ¿e of the Former Year; or eÅ¿pecially the ExactneÅ¿s of the Order, and Proportion of thoÅ¿e new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions we Å¿ee in the Extreme Parts of each Branch, where we find Leaves break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the Å¿ame diÅ¿tance one from another. ThoÅ¿e of Å¿ome <hi>Plants</hi> are diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoÅ¿ite to each other, and of others, at certain diÅ¿tances one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And again, Å¿ome Branches are at certain diÅ¿tances Å¿o perfectly divided by Knots, that they Å¿eem to be Contiguous Bodies, rather than Continued Parts of the Å¿ame Body, as we Å¿ee in the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Elder, &amp;c.</hi> And in general, the Origine of Flowers and Fruits, the Difference of their Colour, TaÅ¿t, Shape, and Smell, and the variety of Leaves and Barks afford us matter of the greateÅ¿t Wonder and Admiration.</p>
                     <p>Now to give the beÅ¿t account we can of all this, let us purÅ¿ue the working of this Heated <hi>Sap</hi> as far as we are able. We have already Å¿aid, that its firÅ¿t Effects in the <hi>Spring,</hi> do uÅ¿ually diÅ¿cover themÅ¿elves in the upper Parts of the Tree, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moÅ¿t ExpoÅ¿ed to the <hi>Air.</hi> Now thoÅ¿e Upper Parts are the <hi>Bole</hi> and the <hi>Branches,</hi> whereof the Former is more MaÅ¿Å¿ive, and the Latter Small and Tender; Upon each of which I conceive the <hi>Sap</hi> Operates after this manner.</p>
                     <p>The latter being Smaller and more Limber, and having a Finer and more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate <hi>Bark,</hi> are more eaÅ¿ily pierced by the <hi>Air,</hi> than thoÅ¿e that are Harder and Larger. And this is the ReaÅ¿on why thoÅ¿e Å¿maller Parts, and eÅ¿pecially the Fruit-Buds they Å¿end forth, are as it were the Fore-runners of the approaching <hi>Spring.</hi> And this appears eÅ¿pecially in Å¿uch Trees as bear <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> the Buds whereof are then Perfected, having begun to be Formed at the Latter end of the Fall of the <hi>Sap</hi> the foregoing Year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48210:251"/>
And thus the firÅ¿t Action of the <hi>Sap</hi> concludes in RaiÅ¿ing the Buds, which it opens Å¿oon after, and at laÅ¿t, if the rigour of the SeaÅ¿on does not hinder, makes the Fruit to Knot in the Center of the Bud, which after it has been the Subject of the <hi>Gard'ner</hi>'s Hopes and Care, is to recompenÅ¿e all his CoÅ¿t and Pains.</p>
                     <p>As for the ordinary <hi>Eyes</hi> which appear upon the Å¿maller Branches, particularly thoÅ¿e of <hi>Core-Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> enlarges Å¿ome of them, thoÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially that are nearer the End, where its Force is the greateÅ¿t; and entering with leÅ¿s ImpetuoÅ¿ity into thoÅ¿e that grow along the Branches, it at the Å¿ame time Å¿ends forth Leaves, and lays a Foundation for Fruit-Buds againÅ¿t the next Year; and thoÅ¿e of the laÅ¿t years Formation which it finds in any good forwardneÅ¿s, it goes on to Perfect the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as for the <hi>Bole</hi> and the largeÅ¿t <hi>Boughs,</hi> the firÅ¿t Action of the <hi>Sap,</hi> when the lenites is over, and it begins to grow Warm, goes no further than to enlarge Å¿uch <hi>Eyes</hi> as it finds already Formed, and to begin the <hi>Formation</hi> of New Branches, as Å¿ometimes alÅ¿o of New Fruit-Buds, tho' it has not yet received any new Å¿upply from the Roots. And this is the reaÅ¿on, that moÅ¿t of the <hi>Branches,</hi> and Trees that are newly Planted, Å¿prout out in the <hi>Spring,</hi> and Å¿hew Å¿ome Å¿igns of Life, tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>it cannot thence be certainly concluded that they are really Alive: For theÅ¿e Å¿mall Sprouts are no Å¿ure Proof that the Trees are Recovered, eÅ¿pecially at the Lower End, where the great Difficulty lies in producing a good Set of New <hi>Roots:</hi> There lies the great PreÅ¿s of the Work of Nature in Recovering the Tree, whereto are required much greater Efforts of the moving <hi>Sap,</hi> than in thoÅ¿e Parts of the Tree, that are ExpoÅ¿ed to the <hi>Air.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now Å¿ee what paÅ¿Å¿es in the other Element, as Å¿oon as the Warmth of the <hi>Spring</hi> has Allay'd its Natural Cold, and the Heated <hi>Air</hi> has Imparted its Warmth to the Old <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are therefore to Imagine that, as the <hi>Sap</hi> being moved in the <hi>Bole</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> requires more Å¿pace than it took up before, Å¿o, being in the very Å¿ame manner moved in the <hi>Roots,</hi> neither can it be wholly Confined in them; and that as the <hi>Sap</hi> appeared firÅ¿t in the Smaller, and then in the Greater <hi>Branches:</hi> So it obÅ¿erves the very Å¿ame Method in the <hi>Roots</hi> alÅ¿o. The Å¿welling <hi>Sap</hi> breaks the <hi>Bark</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, and gets out at every PaÅ¿Å¿age it can poÅ¿Å¿ibly make; and then this, which as well as that above, was Liquid in the Tree, being got out, grows Hard, and aÅ¿Å¿umes the Nature and Form of <hi>Roots</hi> in the Earth, juÅ¿t as that in the <hi>Branches</hi> becomes Leaves, Fruit, New Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THus then this FirÅ¿t and Principal Part of Vegeration begins, Namely, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of <hi>Roots;</hi> Concerning which we are to know that in their firÅ¿t For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they appear White, much like Bubbles of Å¿ome Clammy Fluid, and that they continue of the Å¿ame Colour for Å¿ome days, while they are Å¿hooting out; and after that, this WhiteneÅ¿s which we may call their Native and Infant Colour) turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more Lively one, Å¿omething Red, which repreÅ¿ents their Riper Å¿tate: And while this laÅ¿ts, all thoÅ¿e Greater Operations of the <hi>Roots</hi> are performed. And at laÅ¿t, after a certain number of Years, Å¿ucceeds a Dusky and BlackiÅ¿h hue, which plainly Å¿hews them to be in their Declining Age; InÅ¿omuch that thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger able to perform any of their Offices, they become not only UÅ¿eleÅ¿s, but alÅ¿o Å¿o Prejudicial to the Tree, that we may fitly ReÅ¿emble them to Rotten Teeth in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. For as thoÅ¿e, if they be not pull'd out, Å¿erve only to Torment and DiÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Body: Å¿o unleÅ¿s theÅ¿e Decrepit <hi>Roots</hi> be taken away, the Lower Part of the Tree will I anguiÅ¿h and Decay. And I have therefore Å¿hewn, that the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of theÅ¿e Old <hi>Roots</hi> is the beÅ¿t means of ReÅ¿toring a LanguiÅ¿hing Tree to its former vigour.</p>
                     <p>Now of theÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> that firÅ¿t Å¿pring out, Å¿ome are Weak, namely Å¿uch as are Small; and thoÅ¿e that are Thicker are alÅ¿o Stronger: And at the ends of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theÅ¿e grow very Å¿mall Ones, which we commonly call <hi>Fibers.</hi> TheÅ¿e laÅ¿t Å¿eldom grow to any ConÅ¿iderable BigneÅ¿s; each <hi>Root</hi> acting in Proportion to thoÅ¿e Å¿everal Degrees of Å¿trength or weakneÅ¿s, they naturally have at their firÅ¿t Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48210:251"/>
And of theÅ¿e it may be truly Å¿aid, that they Å¿erve but to very little PurpoÅ¿e, and that they are of no long Continuance, notwithÅ¿tanding all the Care and Pains that many <hi>Gard'ners</hi> take with them. But, for my part, tho' I may have Å¿ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them, Å¿o long as they are in the Earth, yet when they are out, and the Trees are to be <hi>Planted</hi> anew, I cut them all quite away. And this way of Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, I endeavour to JuÅ¿tifie in another Place, where I treat more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of this matter.</p>
                     <p>As to thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> that Å¿prung out Large, and Strong, and Good, and took their beginning from a vigorous Principle, which they could not do, if they grew out of others, that were themÅ¿elves Small, theÅ¿e are the chief Sinews and Strength of the Tree. TheÅ¿e, as they encreaÅ¿e in Length and ThickneÅ¿s, do alÅ¿o continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and Å¿upply more of Å¿uch new Matter as is proper to be Å¿ent up into the Body of the Tree, both to Produce new Growths, and alÅ¿o to Strengthen and Enlarge Å¿uch as are already Produced at the upper end of it. And to Å¿uch <hi>Roots</hi> eÅ¿pecially it is, that thoÅ¿e Trees that Thrive well are beholding for their Beauty, Bulk, and FruitfulneÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>And here we are to ObÅ¿erve, that there are Å¿ome Trees and Plants, wherein that <hi>Sap</hi> which turns to Branches becauÅ¿e it goes out at the Upper Part of the Tree, which is ExpoÅ¿ed to the <hi>Air,</hi> would have become <hi>Roots,</hi> if that part of the Tree, where it made it's PaÅ¿Å¿age ont, had been cover'd with Earth <hi>&amp; c'eÅ¿t ce qui s'appelle Marcoter, ou Provigner.</hi> And contrariwiÅ¿e, that Sap which in the parts under ground turns to Roots, would have been Branches, if it had come out above the Surface of the Earth. And I heartily wiÅ¿h it were as eaÅ¿ie to make <hi>Roots</hi> the Å¿ame way in other Trees, as it is in Å¿etting the Branches of <hi>Vines, Fig-Trees, Quince-Trees, Goosberry-Trees, Myrtle,</hi> and Å¿ome others, for that the Advantages that would thence accrue would be vaÅ¿t, and in a manner infinite, will eaÅ¿ily appear by a General ConÅ¿ideration, without deÅ¿cending to Particulars.</p>
                     <p>And here it may not be Improper to add, That though the Orifices which the Rarify'd Sap makes, be ordinarily either Horizontal, or on the Lower Å¿ide of the <hi>Root,</hi> yet Å¿ometimes they happen to be on the Upper Å¿ide, and inÅ¿tead of <hi>Roots,</hi> Å¿end forth <hi>Shoots,</hi> which grow up into New Trees. This ObÅ¿ervation is as certain as the former, and yet I am Å¿o far from DemonÅ¿trating to others how the different Situation of thoÅ¿e Orifices alone Å¿hould be the CauÅ¿e of Å¿uch different Effects, that I IngenuouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿s I could never find out a ReaÅ¿on Å¿ufficient to Å¿atisfie my Å¿elf therein.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Production of the <hi>Roots,</hi> it is eaÅ¿ie to imagine how they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e in Length and ThickneÅ¿s, by comparing them to a Stream of Water, which grows longer and broader, and Å¿tronger, according as the <hi>Spring,</hi> from whence it ariÅ¿es, Å¿upplies it with a greater quantity of Water: For juÅ¿t after the Å¿ame manner, the Sap aÅ¿cending continually from the <hi>Roots</hi> to the upper parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> is made uÅ¿e of in all thoÅ¿e New Productions we there behold.</p>
                     <p>But I could never yet think of any Material Agent, that might in the leaÅ¿t Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent the manner how the <hi>Roots,</hi> thoÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially of Trees Newly Planted, do at the Å¿ame time Grow themÅ¿elves, and Convey Sap to their Trees. And if I were not afraid of DiÅ¿paraging the Glorious Nature of the Angels, I Å¿hould borrow a Parallel from them, to make my Conceptions in this Matter the better underÅ¿tood: For indeed, thoÅ¿e Spiritual Beings Act with all poÅ¿Å¿ible Perfection, from the very firÅ¿t Moment their Creation has given them an ExiÅ¿tence. And in like manner, theÅ¿e New <hi>Roots</hi> no Å¿ooner appear out of the Old ones, but they immediately enter upon Action in Å¿earching out their own NouriÅ¿hment, and by their Action, which begins as Å¿oon as ever they begin to be, they contribute towards their own EncreaÅ¿e in LargneÅ¿s and Number; and after the very Å¿ame manner they make the Tree which they Support, equally to EncreaÅ¿e in ThickneÅ¿s and Length, in number of Branches, and quantity of Fruit. And in Å¿hort, to the great AÅ¿toniÅ¿hment of him that ConÅ¿iders them, they all on a Å¿udden, and that too in the very Å¿ame Action, Effect their own, and the Good of the whole Tree.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t Sett of New <hi>Roots</hi> that the Rarified Sap produces, are not only Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Feeding themÅ¿elves, and the Tree out of which they grow, but they alÅ¿o immediately Contribute to the Production of a Å¿econd CourÅ¿e of <hi>Roots</hi> which grow out at their ends, and are in all reÅ¿pects like themÅ¿elves, and whereby they alÅ¿o become both Larger and Stronger; and by the Joint-force of both, the whole <hi>Root</hi> of the Tree becomes Longer and better Fortify'd. And, which is yet more wonderful, this Å¿econd Range both contributes to the Feeding and Enlarging the firÅ¿t
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48210:252"/>
from which they Sprang, and alÅ¿o by a continued CourÅ¿e of Acting grow bigger themÅ¿elves, and joining with the former, produce a third CourÅ¿e of little <hi>Roots,</hi> growing out of their Extremities, and Å¿o cloÅ¿ely Link'd, Interwoven, and as it were Incorporated into the two former, as that it is not poÅ¿Å¿ible to LooÅ¿e and DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle them; all which three New <hi>Growths</hi> make up one Body of <hi>Roots,</hi> which is then more able to Act than it was at any time before.</p>
                     <p>And after that thoÅ¿e two former <hi>Growths</hi> have, as I may Å¿ay, given Being to this third, they both receive from it that Supply which before the firÅ¿t receiv'd from the Å¿econd; and theÅ¿e continually Enlarging themÅ¿elves by an endleÅ¿s SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿uch New Productions, and Mutually doing to, and receiving from each other thoÅ¿e good Offices that preÅ¿erve them, they alÅ¿o preÅ¿erve the Tree in all its parts Alive and Vigorous.</p>
                     <p>But after all, I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s I cannot fully Comprehend this continued Miracle of Nature in <hi>Vegetables.</hi> I Å¿ee plainly, that from the Rarefaction of the Sap the firÅ¿t Roots have their Being; but conÅ¿idering them as they Live and Mutually Act, I find it a very difficult Matter to Account for the Acting either of the firÅ¿t or Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or any of the following Growths, Å¿o immediately after they are formed, for they cannot be Idle and Unactive one Moment after they begin to be formed Å¿ince that might make them Dye, and thereupon the whole Tree wou'd certainly Dye alÅ¿o.</p>
                     <p>And what is thus performed in the firÅ¿t Production of Roots, may be illuÅ¿trated by comparing it with the Lighting of a Torch, that will in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure help our Conception of this firÅ¿t Act of <hi>Vegitation.</hi>âThe Torch continues wholly UÅ¿eleÅ¿s and Unactive in the place that contains it, till a little Fire and Flame, apply'd to it from Å¿ome other Matter, put it into a Condition of Burning and Flaming it Self; the firÅ¿t Fire and Flame by their own Vertue and Action, encreaÅ¿ing in the Torch to which they are Communicated.</p>
                     <p>JuÅ¿t Å¿o the Tree remains Unactive, and without any Vegetative Motion in the Earth, 'til by the AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of Å¿omething elÅ¿e, that is, By the Efforts of Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, its Principle of Life having made Å¿ome Å¿mall Beginnings of new Roots at the ends of thoÅ¿e old ones it had before, it at the Å¿ame time begins to perform all the Offices of a Live Tree, thoÅ¿e new Roots encreaÅ¿ing and enlarging themÅ¿elves by their own Operations.</p>
                     <p>And, as in the former CaÅ¿e, the EncreaÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t Fire and Flame proceeds from their Acting, which having melted down Å¿omething a greater quantity of the Neighbouring Matter that is proper for it to Work upon, it furniÅ¿hes both the Fire and the Flame with more Fuel, and conÅ¿equently puts both into a Condition of Acting more vigorouÅ¿ly.</p>
                     <p>After the very Å¿ame manner the firÅ¿t Root being Enliven'd by the AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of Rarefaction, which gave it its Being, it enlarges it Å¿elf to Å¿uch a Degree, that having got together a large quantity of new Sap, and becoming thereby Å¿tronger and better able to perform that kind of Action, it at laÅ¿t produces a great number of other <hi>Roots;</hi> by means whereof, the whole Tree becomes more Beautiful, Large and Vigorous.</p>
                     <p>We eaÅ¿ily perceive that in the Torch, the greater the Heat is the more Matter it melts down; and we obÅ¿erve alÅ¿o, that that melted Matter Å¿erves to encreaÅ¿e the Å¿ame Heat that melted it; and that the Heat thus encreaÅ¿ed has Å¿till a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Subtilize the Matter upon which it Acts, and to turn it into a proportionably thinner Vapour and Exhalation, and conÅ¿equently to make a large Flame bigger; and that this Augmented Flame does again encreaÅ¿e the Heat that produc'd it: And thus we Å¿ee a Circulation of Actions and Re-actions perform'd by the Heat, the Flame, and the Fuel.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, as in the Torch the more Matter the Fire Acts upon, the clearer the Flame is; Å¿o the More and the Better <hi>Roots</hi> the Trees Å¿end forth, the larger the Branches alÅ¿o are, and the longer they are like to live.</p>
                     <p>And this is the ReaÅ¿on alÅ¿o, why Trees Å¿tanding alone have a much greater number of Roots than thoÅ¿e that are Å¿et againÅ¿t a Wall; becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e latter have Roots only on one, whereas the other have them on all Å¿ides. From whence alÅ¿o it comes to paÅ¿s, that the former do uÅ¿ually much exceed the latter, both in Height, ThickneÅ¿s and Duration.</p>
                     <p>And although the Principle of Life, which makes the Roots to Act, be at firÅ¿t the Å¿ame in both, juÅ¿t as the Fire that Lights a great Torch is the Å¿ame that Lights a little one, yet this Principle of Life Å¿eems to grow Å¿tronger in a Tree that Å¿ends forth many Roots, than in one that Å¿ends forth but a few; each Root according to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48210:252"/>
its firÅ¿t Natural Å¿trength and bigneÅ¿s, growing as it were a particular and diÅ¿tinct Agent: So that each PreÅ¿erving and Improving thoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tances which it hath, and Å¿till does receive from the Principle of Life, and without which it would remain void of all manner of Action, it every day Acts more vigorouÅ¿ly, and does really encreaÅ¿e its power of Acting in proportion to its Length and ThickneÅ¿s, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it Multiplies it Å¿elf; which it does after the very Å¿ame manner that the firÅ¿t Fire, and the firÅ¿t Flame of a Torch grows Å¿tronger by the Å¿upply of new Fuel, which they prepare themÅ¿elves by continually encreaÅ¿ing their Heat and Light; and in both, the larger the Matter is, the greater is the Action; only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That whereas the firÅ¿t Fire, and the firÅ¿t Flame, do both periÅ¿h at the Å¿ame time that that firÅ¿t Matter which gave them Being is ConÅ¿umed, and as one may Å¿ay, Annihilated, the Tree's Principle of Life Å¿till Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts after it has loÅ¿t Å¿ome of its Roots. Nay, we Å¿ee that the taking Å¿ome of them away proves the moÅ¿t effectual Means of making it Grow and FlouriÅ¿h.</p>
                     <p>We muÅ¿t therefore lay down this as a certain Truth in the CourÅ¿e of Nature, That in every Plant there is a certain Principle of Life, which continuing the Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, does alÅ¿o continue both the Being and the Action of the Roots in their Formation: That 'tis this Inward Principle, which Co-operating with each of them in thoÅ¿e Offices which Nature has AÅ¿Å¿igned them, AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ts them in performing what otherwiÅ¿e it were impoÅ¿Å¿ible for them to Effect; and conÅ¿equently, that 'tis this Principle alone that gives theÅ¿e Roots a Power either to Attract, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿hall hereafter give my Opinion in this Grand QueÅ¿tion concerning the Action of the Roots; at preÅ¿ent I Å¿hall only Å¿ay, That there are but very few Roots that are able to Act of themÅ¿elves, and when they are once Å¿ever'd from the Trees with which they were formed; I only Å¿ay Å¿ever'd; for of Roots firÅ¿t pluck'd up, and then Å¿et again, I know not whether any are able to Recover themÅ¿elves, and to Act again: And though the principal <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Elms, RoÅ¿e-Trees, Vines, Fig-Trees, RaspiÅ¿h-BuÅ¿hes,</hi> and Å¿ome other very Å¿prightly <hi>Shrubs,</hi> may Å¿ometimes Å¿end forth at that end which was next to the Tree from which they were Cut off, Å¿uch <hi>Sprouts</hi> as may become <hi>Elms, RoÅ¿e-Trees, Vines,</hi> &amp;c. yet 'tis certain that this is a Privilege peculiar to themÅ¿elves, Å¿o that we cannot draw any General ConÅ¿equence from them, that the <hi>Roots</hi> of other Trees and Plants may do the Å¿ame; and upon the whole we may conclude, that there is in every Tree a certain Principle of Life which makes its <hi>Roots</hi> to Act, and that too to the utmoÅ¿t of their Power and Capacity.</p>
                     <p>We muÅ¿t alÅ¿o allow that in reÅ¿pect of this Principle of Life, as well as of the Soil, there is a vaÅ¿t difference between Trees: The Heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> being equal in it Å¿elf, does equally Heat a piece of Ground equally Good in it Å¿elf, and equally Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to its Rays, as it does alÅ¿o all the Trees that are Planted in it, and yet, though they Å¿eemed all in good Condition when they were Set, Å¿ome of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Roots</hi> in abundance, and others none at all, but LanguiÅ¿h and Dye.</p>
                     <p>Which failure muÅ¿t ordinarily be AÅ¿cribed to the Trees themÅ¿elves, and not to the Ground, which we Å¿uppoÅ¿ed equally well Qualified, nor to the Sun which alÅ¿o Acts equally upon both It, and Them.</p>
                     <p>The Planted Trees therefore do chiefly Act by their Principle of Life, Å¿ince it is that which being Animated by the Heat, makes the old <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿end forth Young ones; to the Actings whereof the Trees are obliged for that conÅ¿tant Supply of NouriÅ¿hment which preÅ¿erves and makes them Grow. CuÅ¿tom has fix'd the Name of <hi>Sap</hi> upon this NouriÅ¿hment, and therefore we Å¿hall commonly call it Å¿o, as often as we Å¿hall have occaÅ¿ion to Å¿peak of it.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEfore I proceed to a cloÅ¿er DiÅ¿quiÅ¿ition about the Nature of <hi>Sap,</hi> which is the Å¿ame in Plants that Chile; or Blood are in Animals, the Water in the Bowels of the Earth being alÅ¿o the Å¿ame to Plants, that Food in the Stomach is to Animals, it may be requiÅ¿ite to obÅ¿erve, that as the Earth Å¿erves to produce, and nouriÅ¿h <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi> as having in it a Virtue or Principle of Fertility neceÅ¿Å¿ary for Å¿uch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, Å¿o 'tis alÅ¿o certain that of it Å¿elf, and unleÅ¿s it be duly moiÅ¿tened it cannot
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48210:253"/>
perform thoÅ¿e Offices. JuÅ¿t as <hi>SenÃ©,</hi> which being of a Purging Nature, does not operate of it Å¿elf, but by means of a proportionate quantity of Water, or Å¿ome other Liquid, wherein it is Infus'd, and to which, by that InfuÅ¿ion, it Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its Vertue. But as this Purging Quality becomes altogether Ineffectual, if the proportion of Water be too great for the Quantity of the <hi>SenÃ©,</hi> Å¿o alÅ¿o the Earth becomes Unfruitful, and Rots Fruit-Trees, as well as moÅ¿t other Plants, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be Drench'd or Cover'd with Water. It requires Å¿ome, but not too much MoiÅ¿ture; and too much Wet is altogether as Prejudicial, as too much Drought.</p>
                     <p>Now whereÅ¿oever the Earth is too Dry, it is neceÅ¿Å¿arily Barren: and therefore all the Ground we commonly call Good, is attended with all Å¿orts of MoiÅ¿ture, which indeed is nothing elÅ¿e but real Water diffus'd through every part of the Ground. And this Water comes for the moÅ¿t part, either from Rain, or Snow, or Rivers, or Springs, and Å¿ometimes by Artificial Conveyances; which Water having by its Weight Å¿unk into, and diffuÅ¿ed it Å¿elf through all parts of the Earth, it becomes, as PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿peak, Impregnated with the <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Fertile Salt</hi> of that Earth: Or, to uÅ¿e the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Term, it becomes Å¿o far SeaÅ¿oned with the Quality of that Earth, as to aÅ¿Å¿ume its TaÅ¿te, whatÅ¿oever it be, which it Communicates to thoÅ¿e Plants it NouriÅ¿hes. The Truth of which ObÅ¿ervation is Å¿ufficiently Evinced from Experience in Wines, and Å¿everal Å¿orts of Fruits, which receive different TaÅ¿tes from the different Soils they Grow in.</p>
                     <p>One part of this Impregnated MoiÅ¿ture, whether its Tincture be perceiveable by SenÅ¿e or not, Å¿erves to make Minerals and Fountains: And another part, as we have juÅ¿t now Å¿aid, goes to the Production and NouriÅ¿hment of a ThouÅ¿and Å¿everal Å¿orts of Trees, and Plants, and Vegetables; it being in every Earth of Å¿uch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance as may Å¿erve for the uÅ¿e of all Å¿orts of Trees and Plants, and is, in effect, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elÅ¿e but that Water we are going to Treat of, though it immediately appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different both in Colour, TaÅ¿te, and ConÅ¿iÅ¿tency, as Å¿oon as ever it has, by the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> enter'd into the Å¿everal Plants, and that it ceaÅ¿es to be pure and Å¿imple Water.</p>
                     <p>For whereas it was at firÅ¿t Liquid, before it enter'd the <hi>Roots,</hi> it becomes in time, and by degrees, in a manner perfectly Hard, and as it were MetamorphoÅ¿ed into the Nature either of <hi>Fruits</hi> or <hi>Leaves,</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Bark,</hi> or <hi>Pith;</hi> and there makes a Body more or leÅ¿s Hard, according as it happens to be diÅ¿pos'd of into the Å¿everal <hi>Fruits, Trees,</hi> or <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hence perhaps it comes that the Simple Dew, which is Å¿prinkled upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Flowers in Gardens and Meadows, becomes changed, part into <hi>Honey,</hi> part into <hi>Wax,</hi> and part into little thin <hi>Coats,</hi> as Å¿oon as the <hi>Bees</hi> have with their uÅ¿ual InduÅ¿try Collected, and by the InÅ¿tinct and Direction of Nature, Wrought and Separated it.</p>
                     <p>Now this Hardening of the <hi>Sap</hi> is not to be AÅ¿cribed to any Quality peculiar to it Å¿elf, Å¿ince 'tis no more than what the <hi>Skin</hi> in <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> in Trees may be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to effect, for both of them are in all likelihood made up of the groÅ¿Å¿er parts of the <hi>Sap;</hi> and it is eaÅ¿ie to imagine that they may have a Power of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their own DenÅ¿ity to the <hi>Sap,</hi> when their inward parts come to be Bathed and Drench'd in it. As for inÅ¿tance, When the <hi>Sap</hi> paÅ¿Å¿ing between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> not only AÅ¿cends, by a kind of Filtration, up to the top of the <hi>Plant,</hi> but alÅ¿o, if it be in a Å¿ufficient Quantity, riÅ¿es even above the top, and adds Å¿omething to the length of it.</p>
                     <p>This therefore muÅ¿t be AÅ¿cribed to the Vertue of the <hi>Bark,</hi> which in Trees makes this <hi>Sap</hi> Å¿o Hard and Durable, that it cannot be DiÅ¿Å¿olv'd, but by a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Å¿ome Corroding or Putrifying MoiÅ¿ture; and to the <hi>Skins,</hi> which in <hi>Fruits</hi> makes only a kind of Congelation, and Å¿uch a one as is eaÅ¿ily DiÅ¿Å¿olv'd, either by Chewing, or any Å¿ort of Heat, or by violent BruiÅ¿ing.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt apply'd to all the Å¿ides of a VeÅ¿Å¿el full of Liquor, and then encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ed with Ice, has altogether the Å¿ame Vertue of Congealing the Liquor in the VeÅ¿Å¿el. And thus the InduÅ¿try of PerÅ¿ons of Qualities Servants furniÅ¿h them in the Heat of Summer with Å¿everal Å¿orts of Artificial <hi>Snows,</hi> and delightful <hi>Coolers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But after all, there remains one very great Difficulty, How both the <hi>Skin,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> themÅ¿elves grow Hard, and how they afterwards encreaÅ¿e and enlarge themÅ¿elves. This, I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s, paÅ¿Å¿es my Skill, as indeed do moÅ¿t other things in the whole CourÅ¿e of <hi>Vegetation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is this all, namely, That the Water being made <hi>Sap</hi> by the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> turns by degrees into a Å¿olid Body, but it alÅ¿o undergoes Å¿everal other Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

                     <p>But above all, How can a Man chooÅ¿e but be wonderfully aÅ¿toniÅ¿h'd when he ConÅ¿iders how that which is nothing elÅ¿e but a Å¿weetiÅ¿h, Å¿imple, and harmleÅ¿s Juice, when it comes firÅ¿t to be Lodg'd in the Å¿everal Cells of the Grape, Å¿hou'd, when it is out, make Å¿o Rich, Å¿o Strong, and Å¿o Noble a Liquor.</p>
                     <p>'Tis Å¿trange indeed that this Å¿imple Juice, upon its paÅ¿Å¿age out of thoÅ¿e Natural Cells (where it firÅ¿t Contracted Å¿uch an extream Å¿harpneÅ¿s, and then by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Mellow by the Heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which manag'd the whole proceÅ¿s of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening) being in a great quantity Collected and Shut up in a VeÅ¿Å¿el, Å¿hou'd paÅ¿s Å¿uch a wonderful Change as makes it the Delight of Mankind; for no Å¿ooner is it in the VeÅ¿Å¿el than it begins to Ferment, and to Boil up, juÅ¿t as if its parts were forced up by the Heat of an External Fire; and by the violence of this Natural Agitation it Å¿o Purges it Å¿elf, and comes to Å¿uch a Perfection, as we Å¿hou'd certainly judge Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿Å¿ible, if we were not Convinc'd by Experience.</p>
                     <p>But beÅ¿ides all this we are to obÅ¿erve, That this <hi>Sap</hi> which in the <hi>Stocks</hi> of Å¿uch Trees, for InÅ¿tance, as bear <hi>Core-Fruit,</hi> is InÅ¿ipid, and the very Å¿ame in all Å¿orts of Å¿uch Trees, becomes of a quite different TaÅ¿te in the Å¿everal Fruits which each of thoÅ¿e Trees do reÅ¿pectively bear. It has a Flavour in Å¿ome which it has not in others; it has a Sweet and SugariÅ¿h TaÅ¿te in the <hi>Bergamot-Pear</hi> and <hi>Bon-Chretien,</hi> and an Eager and HarÅ¿h one in the <hi>Franc-real</hi> and <hi>Angober,</hi> &amp;c. And that which in the <hi>Quince-Tree</hi> naturally produces a Hard, Sharp, and UnpleaÅ¿ant Fruit, if it go out at one Å¿ide of the Tree into a <hi>Graff</hi> of a <hi>Butter-Pear,</hi> or <hi>Ambrette,</hi> will produce a Sweet Mellow Fruit, and at the other into an <hi>Amadote,</hi> or <hi>Robin,</hi> and the great <hi>Musk,</hi> a WateriÅ¿h and well Scented Fruit, the different <hi>Graffs</hi> in Å¿ome Trees ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and altering the <hi>Sap</hi> that comes from the <hi>Roots,</hi> much after the Å¿ame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in Water-works the InÅ¿truments do the Water that comes from the elevated Source, the Water of each of thoÅ¿e Artificial Fountains being Naturally alike diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to RepreÅ¿ent any Figure whatÅ¿oever, of a <hi>Drinking-GlaÅ¿s,</hi> for inÅ¿tance, a <hi>Crown, Flower-de-Liz,</hi> &amp;c. according to the Difference of the InÅ¿truments, upon the opening whereof, it being forced out by its own Weight, riÅ¿es up in various forms.</p>
                     <p>After the Å¿ame manner the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Stoek</hi> of a <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> being equally diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to make any kind of Fruit, is by means of the <hi>Graffs</hi> determin'd to this or that Å¿ort in particular.</p>
                     <p>And the particular Alterations which the <hi>Sap</hi> undergoes by reaÅ¿on of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Trees it enters, are no leÅ¿s Wonderful than Infinite.</p>

                     <p>There is, I Å¿ay, no Plant, but only the <hi>Vine,</hi> that can be Graffed by a Å¿imple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ion into the Body of another Plant, without an exact fitting of the <hi>Barks</hi> to each other, nor indeed is a <hi>Vine-</hi>Å¿lip capable of being Å¿o juÅ¿tly Adapted. 'Tis true indeed all other Trees might be Graffed the Å¿ame way as the <hi>Vine</hi> is, if in them as in the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> paÅ¿s'd up the <hi>Bole</hi> in Å¿uch a quantity as were Å¿ufficient to join and incorporate the <hi>Graff</hi> into the Tree, which it does not.</p>
                     <p>Hence alÅ¿o it comes that as the <hi>Sap</hi> never paÅ¿Å¿es out of Å¿uch new Branches in any part of the Å¿ides of the Tree as are without <hi>Bark,</hi> Å¿o neither will it ever paÅ¿s out of the middle of the <hi>Bole</hi> when the upper part of the Tree is cut of, or of the Branches that are crop'd, or of any <hi>Stock</hi> when the Tree is cut down; whereas ordinarily about the end of any Å¿uch cut Tree or Branch having <hi>Bark,</hi> that being the place whither all the <hi>Sap</hi> that was prepar'd in the <hi>Root</hi> chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects its courÅ¿e, it there forms a great number of Branches which break through the <hi>Bark,</hi> and in their formation faÅ¿ten upon that part of the Tree which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t the Breach they have made in the <hi>Bark;</hi> though theÅ¿e Branches are not near Å¿o firmly united to the Tree, as thoÅ¿e are to an old Branch which the <hi>Sap</hi> produces at the end of it.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd Argument to prove that a great part of the <hi>Sap</hi> paÅ¿Å¿es up between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark,</hi> may be taken from the quantity of Water which goes out at the ends of a piece of Wood while it is in burning; and eÅ¿pecially if you burn it Å¿oon after it has been cut off from the <hi>Stock</hi> that nouriÅ¿hed it, for this Liquor iÅ¿Å¿uing out like a whitiÅ¿h Froth, and bubling out from between the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Bark,</hi> falls down and turns to perfect Water.</p>
                     <p>From whence I conclude, that this is nothing elÅ¿e but the diÅ¿Å¿olving of the Å¿ame <hi>Sap,</hi> which having paÅ¿Å¿ed through the <hi>Roots,</hi> was formerly the Nutriment of the Tree, differing now from what it was then only in this, that whereas the MoiÅ¿ture upon its entrance into the <hi>Roots,</hi> was by the acting of the <hi>Roots</hi> render'd capable of aÅ¿Å¿uming the Nature and Quality of Å¿uch <hi>Sap</hi> as was proper for Å¿uch or Å¿uch Trees, becomes of Å¿omewhat a thicker conÅ¿iÅ¿tency, when the Branch which it was to have fed and enlarg'd, is Å¿ever'd from the Live Tree to which it belong'd, or when the whole Tree is pluck'd up by the <hi>Roots.</hi> In either of theÅ¿e caÅ¿es it is Å¿o, as it were laid to Sleep, that it may be preÅ¿erv'd whole Years without any Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, provided the Tree or Branch be kept in a place that is moderately warm and moiÅ¿t; inÅ¿omuch that Å¿uch a Tree or Branch coming at the Years end to be Å¿et again in a good Earth, or <hi>Graffed</hi> upon a good <hi>Stock,</hi> and to have the benefit of a warm <hi>Sun,</hi> flouriÅ¿hes as well as thoÅ¿e that were never remov'd out of the places where they firÅ¿t grew. All which is Å¿ufficiently confirmed by Experience in <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Graffs,</hi> we receive Å¿afe and Å¿ound from Foreign Parts; and in others, which at certain SeaÅ¿ons of the Year we Å¿end thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48210:254"/>
But if inÅ¿tead of Replanting this Tree, or making uÅ¿e of this Branch for a <hi>Graff,</hi> you put them into the Fire, you will Å¿ee that part of the <hi>Sap</hi> which was not turn'd into the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Tree, but only a little thicken'd for want of Action, as Å¿oon as it comes to be heated by the Fire, firÅ¿t to grow thin, and then to Rarifie it Å¿elf to Å¿uch a degree as to paÅ¿s out at the ends of the Tree or Branch in a thouÅ¿and little Sources; and that Liquor, which before its entrance into the Tree was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing but Water, and which afterwards Å¿uffer'd Å¿o many Alterations both in Colour and TaÅ¿te, and ConÅ¿iÅ¿tency, and other Qualities, recovers the Natural Å¿im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity it had before it enter'd the Tree, without any Remains of the Effects of thoÅ¿e great Changes it had undergone, except only a little Å¿harpneÅ¿s in the Smoak, which doubtleÅ¿s is only Accidental, and to be aÅ¿crib'd to the Fire, by which thoÅ¿e pieces of Wood are conÅ¿umed.</p>
                     <p>I know very well that 'tis not only from between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> that the Fire makes this Rarified Water to paÅ¿s out, but that it does the Å¿ame alÅ¿o at the ends of all the inward parts of the <hi>Wood</hi> Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively and circularly, as it were one Lair after another; which it does according as the Heat advancing reaches by degrees, and in a circular manner, the inner parts of the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet this is Å¿o far from deÅ¿troying my HypotheÅ¿is, that the <hi>Sap</hi> paÅ¿Å¿es up chiefly between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark,</hi> that it mightily confirms it. For every one of the inward parts of the Tree having been in their turn, next to the <hi>Bark,</hi> and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently each Å¿oaked in the <hi>Sap</hi> which paÅ¿Å¿ed by it, and indeed being it Å¿elf nothing elÅ¿e but <hi>Sap</hi> condenÅ¿ed, it is no Å¿trange thing to Å¿ee it in its DiÅ¿Å¿olution return to the Å¿ame Matter of which it was at firÅ¿t made. And for the further proof of this Opinion, I have two Arguments to offer, both which Å¿eem to me very Å¿trong and cogent.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t is, that as it is the <hi>Sap</hi> which being for a time grown thick, and as it were cold, Å¿o Å¿trongly glues and joins the <hi>Bark</hi> to the <hi>Wood,</hi> that they are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ily pull'd aÅ¿under; Å¿o upon its being heated either by the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the Spring or Summer, or by our common Fire, they become eaÅ¿ily Å¿eparable. And this is eaÅ¿ily concieveable to every one that conÅ¿iders that almoÅ¿t the very Å¿ame thing is every day done in the uÅ¿e of common Glue.</p>
                     <p>As to the Å¿econd, you need only take a view of the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Bark,</hi> and the outÅ¿ide of the Tree, and you will percieve in both an infinite number of little Gutters or Chanels which are Å¿eparated from each other by as many little Partitions, which Å¿erve to faÅ¿ten the <hi>Bark</hi> to the Tree, and to be PaÅ¿Å¿ages for the <hi>Sap</hi> to aÅ¿cend up to the very top, both to be a continual Supply to all the Å¿everal parts of the Tree, and to add new Growths to Å¿uch Parts as are capable of Enlargement.</p>
                     <p>ObÅ¿erving all thoÅ¿e little Chanels which in every part of the <hi>Wood</hi> appear croÅ¿s-wiÅ¿e from the <hi>Pith</hi> to the <hi>Bark,</hi> like Å¿o many Å¿traight Lines drawn from the Center of a Circle to its Circumference, or the <hi>Sun</hi> as Painters uÅ¿e to draw it, and which are plainly Å¿een in cutting a Turnip through the middle, I know not whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of aÅ¿Å¿igning the <hi>Saps</hi> paÅ¿Å¿age up into the Body of the Tree through the <hi>Fibres</hi> of it, I may not as reaÅ¿onably conclude, That theÅ¿e are the real PaÅ¿Å¿ages by which the <hi>Sap</hi> (which as I have already proved is Lodged, and performs moÅ¿t of its Actions between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark)</hi> is conveyed into the Body of the Tree, to refreÅ¿h and feed all the inward Parts of it, Å¿ince I cannot poÅ¿itively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for what other UÅ¿e Nature Å¿hou'd have intended thoÅ¿e little Chanels which are made with Å¿o much ExactneÅ¿s and CurioÅ¿ity.</p>
                     <p>I have already obÅ¿erved, in Å¿peaking of the Water which becomes <hi>Sap</hi> by the Operation of the <hi>Roots,</hi> that it undergoes a great variety of Alterations in the Å¿everal Plants into which it is received.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the CauÅ¿e of the Difference in <hi>Saps,</hi> and upon the Effects produced by <hi>Engraffing.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Opinion of our Modern PhiloÅ¿ophers, who aÅ¿cribe the great difference that is in <hi>Saps, as well as in other Sublunary Bodies,</hi> to the difference of Pores, is indeed very Ingenious and Pretty: But for my part, I muÅ¿t own, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand it. I cannot imagine how a PoiÅ¿onous Juice Å¿hou'd become wholeÅ¿om, an InÅ¿ipid Sweet, or a Å¿tinking one well Å¿cented, meerly by changing its Place;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48210:255"/>
and how its being in certain Pores of Å¿uch a Figure made it one thing, and then its paÅ¿Å¿ing thence into others of another Figure, Å¿hou'd make it the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithÅ¿tanding this, I Å¿hou'd make no great difficulty of agreeing with Å¿o many Ingenious PerÅ¿ons as maintain this Doctrine of <hi>Pores,</hi> if they wou'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to give as good an account how the great Changes we Å¿ee in Trees by the means of <hi>Graffs,</hi> might be perform'd the Å¿ame way. I confeÅ¿s the CompariÅ¿on between this performance of Nature, and that of a Water Engine, appears very fit for their purpoÅ¿e. It appears at firÅ¿t Å¿ight to have Å¿o much of DemonÅ¿tration in it, as may perhaps Puzzle a Man, but I dare Å¿ay, can never perÅ¿wade or convince him. The Workings of Nature in the <hi>Graffs</hi> are too dark and intricate to be thereby Å¿ufficiently illuÅ¿trated; and the particulars wherein they plainly diÅ¿agree, do vaÅ¿tly exceed thoÅ¿e wherein they Å¿eem to agree, and for which the Fancy was Å¿o much Applauded, as will appear by inÅ¿iÅ¿ting upon Å¿ome particulars, and conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what light this way of Explication can give us therein.</p>
                     <p>The force of the Water-InÅ¿trument, the more it is uÅ¿ed, the weaker it grows, and at laÅ¿t quite Å¿pends it Å¿elf; whereas on the contrary, that of the <hi>Graff,</hi> the more it is Employ'd, the Å¿tronger it grows.</p>
                     <p>Again, each of thoÅ¿e InÅ¿truments can repreÅ¿ent but one Å¿ort of Figure, while every <hi>Graffed</hi> Slip produces a vaÅ¿t number of diÅ¿tinct Effects, and all differing from one another. As for InÅ¿tance, The <hi>Bark</hi> produces <hi>Wood, Leaves, Flowers, Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. which Fruits do alÅ¿o differ in their Colour, Shape, TaÅ¿te, Meat and Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Add hereto, that the Slip in producing an infinite number of other Slips, does alÅ¿o produce a like number of new InÅ¿truments for the conveyance of its <hi>Sap;</hi> a thing which our Water-Engines cannot any ways be Å¿aid to do, Å¿eeing they are incapable of Multiplying themÅ¿elves. As alÅ¿o, laÅ¿tly, That any Water-Engine will Å¿erve for all Å¿orts of Water, whereas each Slip is ReÅ¿trained and Limited to one particular Å¿ort of Fruit: ThoÅ¿e, for inÅ¿tance, of a <hi>Core-Fruit-</hi>Tree, Å¿erving only for the Production of Å¿uch Fruit, and it being impoÅ¿Å¿ible to employ thoÅ¿e of any Å¿ort of Tree in producing the Fruit of another.</p>
                     <p>And now what Convincing Arguments does this CompariÅ¿on bring along with it? And how does it make it barely poÅ¿Å¿ible, that a Å¿maller number of Pores Å¿hou'd of themÅ¿elves be able to alter the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of a much greater number of quite contrary Pores?</p>
                     <p>But that which Å¿till adds to the Difficulty is, That the Å¿maller number of Pores in the Slip being, as I may Å¿ay, become Strangers, Weak, and in Å¿ome Å¿ort already Alter'd by its <hi>Inoculation,</hi> whereas the greater number of Pores in the Tree are, as it were, at Home, and Å¿upported by a Å¿trong and vigorous Stock, one wou'd ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the former Å¿hou'd Å¿ubmit to the latter, and yield to the ImpreÅ¿Å¿ions which the Å¿tronger Å¿hou'd, according to the CourÅ¿e of Nature, make upon the weaker. But here we Å¿ee the quite contrary, the Å¿tronger Å¿hamefully Å¿ubmitting, and all the Glory and Advantage on the weaker's Å¿ide; that a poor Slip pull'd from the Tree whereon it grew, and deprived of all AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance from it, which one wou'd think abÅ¿olutely NeceÅ¿Å¿ary at leaÅ¿t to preÅ¿erve it in its Specific Being, and having nothing but a little of its Native <hi>Sap,</hi> Å¿hou'd not only Live, and PreÅ¿erve its own Species, but alÅ¿o be able as it were to MaÅ¿ter that Å¿o much greater quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> with which it Mixes, <hi>That this Å¿mall Stream Å¿hou'd Å¿top the Violence of Å¿o mighty a Torrent, and keep it Å¿elf within its own narrow Bounds, instead of being hurried away by the Violence of the Current to which it is joined.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The vigorous <hi>Stock</hi> was, by the particular manner of its Action upon the <hi>Sap,</hi> which its <hi>Roots</hi> had prepared about to produce a Fruit of Å¿uch a TaÅ¿te, Colour, Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>Sap</hi> finding one or more <hi>Graffs</hi> in its paÅ¿Å¿age up the Tree, accommodates it Å¿elf to them, and produces both Trees and Fruits of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature.</p>
                     <p>Thus a <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> for Example, about to produce <hi>Quinces,</hi> which every Body knows to be a Hard, HarÅ¿h, Gritty, and UnpleaÅ¿ant Fruit, produces a vaÅ¿t number of very good and Å¿weet <hi>Pears;</hi> and an <hi>Almond-Tree,</hi> which Naturally bears only <hi>Almonds,</hi> is thus made to bear <hi>Plumbs, Apricots,</hi> &amp;c. And all this by means of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Slips, which being, as I may Å¿o Å¿ay, endued with a Commanding Power, and preÅ¿enting themÅ¿elves to the aÅ¿cending <hi>Sap,</hi> oblige it to paÅ¿s according to their Directions, and Subject it to all thoÅ¿e Å¿everal Alterations which we daily Å¿ee in <hi>Graffed</hi> Trees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48210:255"/>
Now the better to comprehend how this little <hi>Graff</hi> Works, and by what Power of Nature it Å¿erves it Å¿elf Å¿o advantagiouÅ¿ly of that MaÅ¿s of Matter which were Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to drown and deÅ¿troy it, or at leaÅ¿t make it Å¿ubmit to it, we may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly reÅ¿emble it to a weak Child, and one that is not of the Royal Blood, placed at the Head of an Army at the Å¿ame time that it is Engaged. The Army continues reÅ¿olutely to purÅ¿ue the Orders it received from its General, till the Young SucceÅ¿Å¿or coming to give New Orders, Employs its Force and Courage in the Execution of a quite contrary DeÅ¿ign. Now that which enables this New Commander, who is yet a Child, thus all on a Å¿udden to put the whole Army upon a different Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, can be nothing elÅ¿e but a certain Character of MajeÅ¿ty which he carries in his PerÅ¿on, which makes the Army, how Numerous and Brave, and how Hot Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was upon another DeÅ¿ign, at the very firÅ¿t to Acknowledge his Sovereign Authority, blindly to follow, and without any manner of Reluctancy to Execute his Orders; though perhaps it may not do Å¿o very long, no longer than till another New Commander Å¿hall get the Å¿ame Advantage over him, which he had over the firÅ¿t. All which we Å¿ee in Å¿ome Å¿ort performed by the <hi>Sap</hi> of the <hi>Graff,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has prevailed over that of the Tree, comes it Å¿elf to be Å¿ubject to that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿et upon it Å¿elf.</p>
                     <p>But yet after all it muÅ¿t be owned, that though there be nothing either more common or more eaÅ¿ie than Engraffing, there is nothing in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Vegetables</hi> that is more Wonderful, or harder to be UnderÅ¿tood than it.</p>
                     <p>It Å¿hou'd Å¿eem that Nature has here placed the bounds of our CurioÅ¿ity, Dazling our Sight when it wou'd pierce any farther, thinking it Å¿ufficient we Å¿hou'd know how to apply the Agent and the Patient together, without diÅ¿covering the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner of that Action whereby Å¿uch Wonderful Effects are produced; and perhaps if we knew it, we Å¿hou'd not be much better <hi>Graffers</hi> than we now are without that Knowledge: And a Å¿mall Experience is Å¿ufficient to teach us both the Manner and the SucceÅ¿s of every kind of <hi>Graffs</hi> in all Å¿orts of Fruits. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be content to make the beÅ¿t UÅ¿e we can of what we know already in this Particular, without Å¿pending time in endeavouring to advance our Knowledge fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein. Let us fix our Thoughts upon Å¿ome other Things, which may be conÅ¿ider'd with leÅ¿s Difficulty and more Advantage, and endeavour to diÅ¿cover Å¿omething that may be of uÅ¿e to us in the Better and Quicker Improvement of them.</p>
                     <p>From all that has been thus far DiÅ¿courÅ¿ed upon this Subject of <hi>Graffs,</hi> I cannot but conclude, That there muÅ¿t of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity be Å¿omething more extraordinary in all this than what can be aÅ¿cribed to the bare meeting together of certain Pores, Å¿ome of one Figure, and Å¿ome of another.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I further obÅ¿erve that in every Tree a certain Quantity of <hi>Sap,</hi> which of it Å¿elf is equally diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to make either <hi>Wood, Leaves, Fruit,</hi> or <hi>Bark,</hi> paÅ¿Å¿es up into a Branch of a <hi>Wallnut,</hi> a <hi>Marroneer,</hi> an <hi>Orange,</hi> or <hi>Cherry-Tree;</hi> and that at certain places of thoÅ¿e Branches this <hi>Sap,</hi> after it has Å¿ent forth BloÅ¿Å¿oms, which are the firÅ¿t beginnings of the Fruit, comes promiÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly, and without diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing it Å¿elf into parts, to enter the Stalks of each of thoÅ¿e BloÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oms, how Å¿mall Å¿oever they be; and immediately upon this ProgreÅ¿s of the <hi>Sap</hi> thus far, and its paÅ¿Å¿age out of the Stalk, it Å¿o dextrouÅ¿ly Å¿eparates it Å¿elf, that in a <hi>Wallnut,</hi> for InÅ¿tance, one part goes to make a Green, Tough, and Bitter <hi>Bark,</hi> another part the Shell lin'd with Films, a third to make certain Partitions exactly proportioned where the Body of the <hi>Nut</hi> is to be formed and lodged, a fourth the Skin that is to cover it; and laÅ¿tly, another part makes the <hi>Nut</hi> it Å¿elf Å¿weet, and without any thing of that bitterneÅ¿s with which 'tis encompaÅ¿Å¿ed on every Å¿ide; and from which it Å¿eems to have been Extracted.</p>

                     <p>Whether this Å¿mall Stalk be really the Womb where all thoÅ¿e <hi>Pores</hi> are formed, or whether it is any more than a Chanel through which they only paÅ¿s, without leaving any of their number behind, when they go to make Å¿uch fair, uÅ¿eful, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cented Fruits.</p>
                     <p>How this Number of <hi>Pores</hi> Å¿o range themÅ¿elves in the Stalks of Fruits, as to make them always exactly of Å¿uch a determinate length; In Leaves, Å¿o as to make that half Leaf <hi>en caur</hi> which we find before the great Leaf in <hi>Orange-Trees:</hi> In the <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Almond,</hi> to preÅ¿erve the reÅ¿pective bigneÅ¿s of their Shells: In <hi>Plants,</hi> to obÅ¿erve the Å¿ame diÅ¿tances between the knots whereby they are at certain lengths, diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, as in the <hi>RoÅ¿e-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Sureau,</hi> as alÅ¿o in <hi>Corn;</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all this with Å¿o much exactneÅ¿s and proportion.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore when in the Months of <hi>January</hi> or <hi>February,</hi> Thirty <hi>Melon-Seeds,</hi> for Example, being Å¿et in the Å¿ame Bed, are Å¿o far from Sprouting or Growing up all together, that there is Å¿ometimes Three or Four, or Five or Six Months Å¿pace, between the firÅ¿t and the laÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>I wou'd gladly have thoÅ¿e that will needs have <hi>Vegetation</hi> performed by a forcible bringing in of certain little Particles of Earth into the <hi>Plant,</hi> ReÅ¿olve me in theÅ¿e Particulars.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t, Whether Particles thus brought in, have <hi>Pores</hi> or not? If they have, then we Å¿hall have <hi>Pores</hi> brought one into another; And then pray conÅ¿ider, whither Å¿uch a Notion as this will lead us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whether the <hi>Pores</hi> are all firÅ¿t Form'd before the <hi>Seed</hi> is Set, or whether they are afterwards made by the Heat of the Bed? They cannot Å¿ay it is done the latter way; and if the former, I Demand further,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Whether thoÅ¿e <hi>Pores</hi> are always open and ready to receive, or they are open'd by the Heat of the Bed?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, SuppoÅ¿ing thoÅ¿e <hi>Pores</hi> always open, I wou'd know whether they have any thing within, or Nothing?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Upon this SuppoÅ¿al that they are all open, I ask further, Why thoÅ¿e in one Seed do not as well, and as Å¿oon draw in theÅ¿e Earthly Particles as thoÅ¿e of another?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Granting this Introduction of Å¿mall Particles of Earth, How comes it to paÅ¿s that thoÅ¿e Particles, which in all things elÅ¿e appear plainly to go upward, enter into the Seed for no other end, but only that they may immediately paÅ¿s out again downwards, that Å¿o they may be turn'd into <hi>Roots?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48210:256"/>
Seventhly, I Demand whether new <hi>Pores</hi> are Formed in the <hi>Root,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced Particles come in only through thoÅ¿e new <hi>Pores,</hi> or whether they Å¿till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to come in only through thoÅ¿e of the Seed, through which they firÅ¿t enter'd in to make their <hi>Roots?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would alÅ¿o further know, Whether one Å¿ort of <hi>Wood</hi> be more <hi>Porous</hi> than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I own that Å¿ome have larger <hi>Pores</hi> than others, as the <hi>Liege,</hi> for Example, than the <hi>Ebene:</hi> But I cannot conceive how one Å¿hould have more than another, Å¿ince all are made up of little Parts which come together Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively one after another.</p>
                     <p>Now if all <hi>Roots</hi> be equally <hi>Porous,</hi> how comes it that Å¿ome Act more vigorouÅ¿ly than others? The <hi>Vine,</hi> for InÅ¿tance, and the <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> make abundantly more <hi>Roots</hi> than any other Trees.</p>
                     <p>Is it not reaÅ¿onable to aÅ¿cribe theÅ¿e Effects to a certain Principle of Action which exerts it Å¿elf more vigorouÅ¿ly in thoÅ¿e than in any other <hi>Vegetables,</hi> juÅ¿t as we Å¿ee more of vigour and Å¿prightlineÅ¿s in one Man than in another; and in one fort of Brutes than in Å¿ome of another Kind?</p>
                     <p>I would alÅ¿o fain know, whence it happens, as we Å¿ee it often does, that certain Trees newly Planted remain a long time in the Earth, Å¿ome two or three Months; nay as many Years, without any the leaÅ¿t appearance of Action: As alÅ¿o how Å¿ome Seeds continue whole Years without Sprouting?</p>
                     <p>This queÅ¿tionleÅ¿s muÅ¿t be acknowledged a matter of great Difficulty, and very ObÅ¿cure. In Å¿hort therefore, I will take it for granted, that there is more in the effecting of all this, than a meer meeting together of certain great or little <hi>Pores</hi> of different Figures. That we muÅ¿t look higher for the Original of that <hi>Vegetative</hi> Faculty, and own that Principle of Life to be neither a Free nor a CaÅ¿ual, but a NeceÅ¿Å¿ary Agent; concerning which I Å¿hall Å¿peak more at large <hi>hereafter,</hi> which by means of an External Heat, and a due Proportion of MoiÅ¿ture, is <hi>determined</hi> to Form thoÅ¿e Å¿everal Particles of Matter, Å¿ome into Skin, others into Pulp, others into Juice, Å¿ome to give the Fruit its ReliÅ¿h, and others its Smell; Å¿ome to become Seeds, others Stalks of the Fruits, and others the Wood of the Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is this alÅ¿o that, by means of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which it Prepares in the <hi>Roots,</hi> makes the Trees capable of receiving an infinite variety of Alterations, juÅ¿t as the MoiÅ¿ture of the Earth makes it capable of Producing, or rather indeed of being InÅ¿trumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Production of Å¿o many Å¿everal Å¿orts of <hi>Plants,</hi> all different one from another.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Living</hi> Stock of each Tree is, in effect, the Å¿ame to <hi>Graffs</hi> that the Earth is to <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Plants;</hi> and in Å¿ome Å¿ort the Å¿ame that the Air is to the Different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments of MuÅ¿ick, or Water to the InÅ¿truments of Water-works: That is, the <hi>Sap</hi> in each of thoÅ¿e Stocks is equally diÅ¿pos'd to produce this or that Effect; and conÅ¿equently is capable of great Alterations, according to the difference of the <hi>Graffs</hi> which are Å¿et upon the <hi>Stock;</hi> between which and them, there muÅ¿t however be Å¿ome Å¿ort of Natural Agreement.âThough after all, the farther I purÅ¿ue this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, the greater Difficulties I find my Å¿elf Entangled in, and the leÅ¿s able I am to Å¿atisfy my own CurioÅ¿ity.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿hould very willingly Embrace this New Opinion, if it could not Å¿hew me all the Å¿everal Figures of thoÅ¿e Wonderful <hi>Pores,</hi> but only Teach me, how, upon occaÅ¿ion, to direct Nature to make Å¿uch <hi>Pores</hi> as were for my PurpoÅ¿e, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Making of Å¿uch as were not. But now that there is no great likelihood that this PhiloÅ¿ophy will ever procure us Å¿uch an Advantage, Å¿ince none has yet been able to attain to it, and that notwithÅ¿tanding all that is, or can be Å¿aid, we muÅ¿t have RecourÅ¿e to Divine Providence, and AÅ¿Å¿ert that if what thoÅ¿e Gentlemen Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance be true, that every particular Kind of Fruit is of Å¿uch, or Å¿uch a TaÅ¿t, Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s or Shape, meerly becauÅ¿e its <hi>Pores</hi> are of Å¿uch or Å¿uch a Figure: (I Å¿ay we muÅ¿t AÅ¿Å¿ert) that 'tis the Divine Providence alone that has Ordained, that <hi>Pores</hi> of Å¿uch or Å¿uch a Figure Å¿hall certainly make Å¿uch or Å¿uch a Å¿ort of Fruit. <hi>And then Pray, what New DiÅ¿coveries has this PhiloÅ¿ophy made towards finding out of the Nature of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Beings? And did not the Old HypotheÅ¿is go altogether as far in Å¿earching out the firÅ¿t Workings of Providence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if in favour of this Opinion it be urged, That one day <hi>Lunetts</hi> and <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿copes</hi> may poÅ¿Å¿ibly be invented, whereby theÅ¿e <hi>Pores</hi> may plainly be Å¿een and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hed, and that there wants only Time and InduÅ¿try to bring all this to paÅ¿s, may it not alÅ¿o, with as good ReaÅ¿on be hoped, That the Å¿ame InÅ¿truments may Å¿erve to DiÅ¿cover the Attractive Motion of the <hi>Roots,</hi> againÅ¿t which thoÅ¿e Gentlemen Å¿o
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48210:257"/>
eagerly contend? Though to Å¿peak my Mind freely, I cannot underÅ¿tand what a Company of <hi>Pores</hi> is able to effect; how each Å¿hould be joyn'd to its Fellow, Å¿o at leaÅ¿t as to make up any thing that is not it Å¿elf a <hi>Pore;</hi> what their Å¿ides are made of, and what they are joyn'd together with. I am indeed of Opinion, that in every one of the Works of Nature there are a great many of theÅ¿e <hi>Pores;</hi> as alÅ¿o, tht they are much bigger in Å¿ome Bodies than in others. But Å¿ince <hi>Pores</hi> can be nothing elÅ¿e but little Bodies, that is, Figured Cells, having no Å¿olid Matter within, and compaÅ¿s'd about with their own Å¿ides, thoÅ¿e Å¿ides muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be Å¿olid; and alÅ¿o be joyn'd together by Å¿omething elÅ¿e of a Nature different from their own. And this will engage us in Å¿uch deep Speculations, as are not leÅ¿s difficult than the Ideas of Accidents and Occult Qualities; which I think is as much as needs be Å¿aid, for 'tis no more poÅ¿Å¿ible that a ConcourÅ¿e of many <hi>Pores</hi> Å¿hould make up a Å¿olid Body, without being determined by Å¿ome other thing that is Å¿olid, than that in Arithmetic a Line of Ciphers Å¿hould make up an Effective Number, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the Head of it Å¿ome one of thoÅ¿e Nine Principal Characters, which CuÅ¿tom and Common ConÅ¿ent has VeÅ¿ted with a Power of Determining what each of thoÅ¿e Ciphers Å¿hall Å¿tand for in Numeration.</p>
                     <p>Their Notion, who hold that all theÅ¿e Changes can be AÅ¿crib'd to nothing elÅ¿e but Å¿uch different Qualities as the Great Author of Nature has thought good to fix in the Å¿everal kinds of Bodies, is more eaÅ¿ily conceiv'd, and better underÅ¿tood, by my weak and Å¿hallow ReaÅ¿on.</p>
                     <p>Though after all, I do not pretend MagiÅ¿terially to Determine, whither of the two Opinions has the more of Certainty and ReaÅ¿on on its Å¿ide, my BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s being only to preÅ¿ent to the World thoÅ¿e Thoughts which my Study, and the Remarks I have made upon <hi>Vegetation,</hi> have Å¿uggeÅ¿ted to me. And in this Particular I Å¿hall uÅ¿e the Å¿ame Diligence I have done in the reÅ¿t of the Book.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, I have upon OccaÅ¿ion conÅ¿ider'd Å¿everal other Parts of the Works of Nature, and obÅ¿erv'd how the Heads of Å¿ome Å¿orts of Birds are Adorned with Tufts and Combs, whilÅ¿t others are DiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h'd either by the Feathers, or the Make of their Bodies.</p>
                     <p>And I have alÅ¿o often Admired the Melodious and Charming Notes of the Nightingale and Canary-Bird, while thoÅ¿e of the Magpy, the Jay, and the Crow, are Å¿o harÅ¿h and ungrateful. And how wonderfully Å¿atisfied am I in my Å¿elf, when conÅ¿idering theÅ¿e, and an infinite Number of other Particulars, I ReÅ¿olve all meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Good PleaÅ¿ure of the Great Author of Nature, which Ordain'd all theÅ¿e pretty Marks of DiÅ¿tinction that make up that Wonderful Harmony and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Great Machine, the World, without ever Troubling my Å¿elf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider how poÅ¿Å¿ibly, by the help of this Doctrine of <hi>Pores,</hi> all this might be well, and convincingly Accounted for.</p>
                     <p>So that Referring all this Variety we Å¿ee in <hi>Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Seeds,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Providence of God, I Å¿hall only add, That Å¿o Wonderful has been the Contrivance of the Great Creator in every, the Å¿malleÅ¿t piece of his Work-manÅ¿hip, as well as in thoÅ¿e great ones, the Heavens and the Earth, as Å¿hews his WiÅ¿dom and his Power to be equally Infinite.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48210:257"/>
Each of theÅ¿e Opinions has its Patrons and Friends; and indeed, both Å¿eem to be Supported by good and plauÅ¿ible ReaÅ¿ons. But my preÅ¿ent BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s being only to offer my own ObÅ¿ervations upon <hi>Husbandry,</hi> I Å¿hall be as ReÅ¿erv'd in giving my Judgment in this, as I have been in that other CaÅ¿e of <hi>Pores,</hi> and declare Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly, That I am not able poÅ¿itively, to Determine in Favor either of the one, or the other.</p>
                     <p>And yet how Difficult Å¿oever it may be to Explain, or even to Conceive a clear Idea of what we call <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> in Sublunary Bodies, I cannot but own my Inclination to Approve rather of Living and Attractive Powers, than an Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and LifeleÅ¿s Row and Order of <hi>Parts of Matter.</hi> And indeed it Å¿eems to me very ReaÅ¿onable, to AÅ¿Å¿ign Action to that alone which has need of it, namely, to <hi>Plants,</hi> to the end they may Attract, and Suck in Å¿uch NouriÅ¿hment, as may be NeceÅ¿Å¿ary both to PreÅ¿erve and Enlarge themÅ¿elves, and to Multiply their Species. And thence I conclude, that 'tis they that Act.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt the Earth would not grow Lank, Meagre, and Hungry, as it does, if the <hi>Plants</hi> did not Suck it juÅ¿t as Animals do their Dams; and as they do not tarry till the Milk comes to find out them, Å¿o neither do the <hi>Plants</hi> expect till the Vapours and Exhalations come and preÅ¿ent themÅ¿elves to the <hi>Pores.</hi> This MoiÅ¿tureriÅ¿es up continually out of the Bowels of all Å¿orts of Earth, though thoÅ¿e Earths do not thereby ceaÅ¿e to be Å¿till FreÅ¿h; that is, in a Condition to produce all Å¿orts of Fruits. And Å¿ince it is utterly falÅ¿e that the GoodneÅ¿s of any Rich Soil Decays, or is in the leaÅ¿t DiminiÅ¿hed by being not made uÅ¿e of in Feeding Å¿ome Å¿et <hi>Plants,</hi> it neceÅ¿Å¿arily follows, That when Å¿uch an Earth fails of its uÅ¿ual FruitfulneÅ¿s, as it Å¿ometimes does, even to perfect BarrenneÅ¿s, this Decay muÅ¿t proceed from the Activity of the <hi>Roots,</hi> which by their Attractive Motion have ExhauÅ¿ted all that Fruitful Salt which Nature had furniÅ¿hed it with. And if we obÅ¿erve how the <hi>Roots</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> Å¿et in a CheÅ¿t of Earth, get out in great Numbers, at Å¿uch Holes or Crevices of the CheÅ¿t as are neareÅ¿t the Ground, that they may there Grow and Multiply, I know not whether we may not, with very good ReaÅ¿on, allow them a kind of Local Motion.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, it is for ReaÅ¿ons that Incline me to Favour this Opinion of an Attractive Power in the <hi>Roots,</hi> that I do leave but a very few <hi>Roots</hi> upon the Trees I Plant; for if I imagined that the <hi>Sap,</hi> which the Tree requires in great Abundance, did without any Action in the <hi>Vegetable,</hi> barely enter into the <hi>Roots</hi> through Å¿uch Holes, or <hi>Pores,</hi> as it found open, I Å¿hou'd certainly believe that the more old <hi>Roots</hi> I left on, the more <hi>Pores</hi> or Holes to receive the <hi>Sap</hi> I Å¿hou'd alÅ¿o leave, and that it wou'd aÅ¿cend in greater quantities into the Bodies of Å¿uch Trees, than of thoÅ¿e that had fewer <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my own Experience Å¿hews me that all this is falÅ¿e, and that a good Tree, of what Å¿ort Å¿oever, being Planted in a good Earth, with a few <hi>Roots,</hi> and reaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Å¿hort, Grows much better and quicker than another equally Good, and Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Å¿ame time in as Rich an Earth with many long <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this CaÅ¿e I think I may Å¿afely rely upon my own Experience, Å¿ince I herein advance nothing but upon above Thirty Years Tryal and Careful ObÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And upon the whole, I lay down this as a Å¿tanding Rule, That the more old <hi>Roots</hi> you leave upon the Tree you Plant, the fewer and the worÅ¿e the New ones will be which it Å¿ends forth; whereas the fewer you leave, provided they be good ones, and indifferently Å¿hort, the more and the better the New ones will be. And to this I chiefly AÅ¿cribe the different SucceÅ¿s we uÅ¿ually obÅ¿erve in Planting.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Lay down this as another Maxim which I think never fails, and which, having already Å¿poken Å¿omething of it, I come now more fully to Enlarge upon; Namely, That there is in every <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Plant</hi> a certain Principle of Life, which being AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted with all the neceÅ¿Å¿ary CircumÅ¿tances of a good Earth, due MoiÅ¿ture, a favourable Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes every part of the <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>Plant</hi> Å¿o to Act, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all its Offices, that they all continue in their Natural Vigour, Å¿o long as this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48210:258"/>
Vital Principle is not injured; and that as Å¿oon as it is deÅ¿troyed, the <hi>Plant</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Dies.</p>
                     <p>But this Vital Principle is not in all <hi>Plants</hi> lodged in one and the Å¿ame place; for in Å¿ome 'tis lodged in that outward Eye of the <hi>Plant,</hi> which is the firÅ¿t that appears above Ground, and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hes it from other <hi>Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Melons, Turnips,</hi> and all Å¿orts of <hi>Annual Flowers;</hi> and this being cut off, all the reÅ¿t of the <hi>Plant</hi> immediately dies, and that without recovery.</p>
                     <p>In others 'tis Å¿eated in the Ball of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Tulips, Jacintes, Imperiales, Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, &amp;c.</hi> And theÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> do not die, but when their round <hi>Root</hi> is Å¿poiled by Heat, or Cold, or Wet, or by being cut or bruiÅ¿ed; nor will the taking away the fore-mentioned Eye do them any great hurt.</p>
                     <p>In others, beÅ¿ides its principal Seat, which I Å¿hall Å¿peak of by and by, when I come to Treat of <hi>Great Trees,</hi> 'tis diffuÅ¿ed like a kind of Seed through all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Parts, as is evident in the Branches of <hi>Vines, Fig-Trees, Quince-Trees, Salows, Ivy, GiroÅ¿tees, Jaunes,</hi> and in general of all Å¿orts that eaÅ¿ily admit of either Engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing or Inoculation.</p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, In others, as in all <hi>Trees,</hi> both thoÅ¿e that do, and Å¿uch as do not bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> this <hi>Vital Principle</hi> Å¿eems to be between the <hi>Bole</hi> and the <hi>Roots;</hi> for the Upper Parts may be cut off, and the <hi>Roots</hi> taken away, provided nothing be done to the very place where it is lodged, and yet the <hi>Tree</hi> be Å¿o far from being prejudiced thereby, that on the contrary this will make it Å¿end forth both more <hi>Branches,</hi> and more <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that which gave me the greateÅ¿t Light in judging of the Seat of this <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> was the ObÅ¿ervations I made upon the Sprouting either of <hi>Almonds,</hi> or <hi>Peach-Stones,</hi> or the Seeds of <hi>Melons, Lettuces,</hi> or any other Å¿ort of <hi>Pot-herbs;</hi> that when they come once to be throughly moiÅ¿ten'd, and heated in the Earth, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of each Å¿welling Å¿o, as not to be any longer contained within their reÅ¿pective <hi>Shells</hi> or <hi>Skins,</hi> it makes it Å¿elf a paÅ¿Å¿age out at the Å¿harpeÅ¿t part of the <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> howÅ¿oever it happen'd to lie in the Ground; and thence iÅ¿Å¿ues out firÅ¿t the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a <hi>Root,</hi> white, and proportionable to the <hi>Nut,</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> out of which is Å¿prouts. This, directing its courÅ¿e downwards, grows longer and thicker, and Å¿ends forth other Å¿mall <hi>Roots</hi> all along on every Å¿ide of it. And all this it does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing appears to aÅ¿cend upwards to the Å¿urface of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>But at length when the <hi>Root</hi> has Å¿o fixed and Å¿trengthen'd it Å¿elf, as to be able to Å¿upport and nouriÅ¿h the <hi>Plant,</hi> whereof it is to be the Foundation, then at the very Å¿ame place where it Å¿prung out, the <hi>Nut</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> perfectly opens it Å¿elf, to give a paÅ¿Å¿age to the Stem, which begins its Formation exactly in the Å¿ame place with the Root; and by degrees it works it Å¿elf through all the Earth that lies upon it, and at laÅ¿t appears above Ground in a few Å¿mall Leaves, which Å¿hew both the Top of the <hi>Plant,</hi> and of what kind it is, and Å¿o grows up to its natural bigneÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>I hold then, that there is in <hi>Plants</hi> a certain Principle of Life, and that is the very Å¿ame that PhiloÅ¿ophers call <hi>The Vegetative Soul;</hi> and that 'tis a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Agent which at certain times cannot but act, and that too Å¿ometimes after Å¿uch a manner as Men Å¿hall direct.</p>
                     <p>But to make it do Å¿o, care muÅ¿t be taken, that That part of the <hi>Plant</hi> where this Vital Principle is chiefly lodged, be perfectly Å¿ound; that the Principle it Å¿elf be moved and actuated by a juÅ¿t degree of Heat; and laÅ¿tly, that if the <hi>Plant</hi> have Roots, they be found, and Å¿et in a good Earth, duly moiÅ¿ten'd. But for the better clearing of this Particular, it may be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e four Things:</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t, That that part of the <hi>Plant</hi> where the Vital Principle is Å¿eated be Å¿ound, and in good condition: For if it be in the leaÅ¿t Putrified or Corroded, or have Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any thing from Cold, Drought, or any other Accident, it will receive no benefit from that Heat which <hi>Plants</hi> require, but will at beÅ¿t Thrive but very ill, and perhaps quite die away.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it be CheriÅ¿hed with a due and a proportionable degree of Heat, both in the the Earth, and in the Air; For Å¿ome Plants are Å¿oon Heated, and put into Action, as all <hi>Spring-Flowers</hi> in General, the <hi>Indian CheÅ¿nut,</hi> the <hi>RaÅ¿pis,</hi> the <hi>Sparagus,</hi> and moÅ¿t Kitchin-Herbs, and particularly the <hi>Oignons de Coronne Imperiale,</hi> the <hi>Tulip,</hi> and Å¿ome others; Å¿ome of which Å¿hoot out their Roots, and others their Stem, without being Å¿et in the Ground; and that too when the Power of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Å¿eems to be as it were aÅ¿leep, namely in the month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And others again are of a colder Complexion, and harder to be moved; Å¿uch as the <hi>Mulberry, Yew-Å¿eeds, Sweet Charvil, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore 'tis no wonder if
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48210:258"/>
all <hi>Plants</hi> do not enter upon Action at one and the Å¿ame time, tho' the Heat both of the Earth, and of the Air, be the Å¿ame to all, and upon that ConÅ¿ideration might be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to Influence all alike. So that it is evident, that 'tis the different Nature of the <hi>Plants</hi> that makes them quicker or Å¿lower in entring upon a Å¿tate of Action.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Action of the <hi>Vital Principle</hi> is limited and confined to certain Å¿paces of Time, which in Å¿ome <hi>Plants</hi> are much longer than in others; as in all larger <hi>Trees,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e we commonly call for diÅ¿tinction-Å¿ake <hi>Green-Trees,</hi> Å¿uch as the <hi>Yew,</hi> the <hi>EÅ¿picias,</hi> the <hi>Holly, &amp;c.</hi> as alÅ¿o in the <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> In moÅ¿t of which <hi>Trees,</hi> it Å¿carcely ever gives over Acting either in Summer or Winter, provided none of thoÅ¿e four Qualifications be wanting. In other <hi>Plants</hi> this SeaÅ¿on of Action is much Å¿horter, and can by no means be prolonged beyond that time Nature has aÅ¿Å¿igned it, as in <hi>Lettices, PeaÅ¿e, Tulips, Anemonies, Hyacinths, &amp;c.</hi> all which have but a very Å¿hort time of Action, and appear in a manner quite dead within a very few months after they firÅ¿t began to give any certain Å¿igns of Life.</p>
                     <p>The laÅ¿t thing I am to obÅ¿erve is, That the <hi>Roots</hi> muÅ¿t not only be Å¿ound, but alÅ¿o Å¿et in a good Earth duly moiÅ¿ten'd: For if the <hi>Roots</hi> be Damaged, either by drought, or any other way; or if being Sound, they happen to be Å¿et in an Earth that is either bad, or exhauÅ¿ted; or laÅ¿tly, if being good, it want due moiÅ¿ture: In any of theÅ¿e caÅ¿es, you will not be Å¿enÅ¿ible of any manner of Action the <hi>Plant</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms.</p>
                     <p>And this is a Truth which every body knows, Å¿o that I need not Enlarge upon it. We Å¿ee daily InÅ¿tances of it, eÅ¿pecially in the Spring, in <hi>Trees</hi> both kept in CheÅ¿ts, and newly Set. For if either of theÅ¿e want moiÅ¿ture, without which they cannot Act, and conÅ¿equently grow too Hot, and Dry, they immediately Å¿eem as it were Faint, and in a dying Condition; but no Å¿ooner are they wet either with a Shower, or by the Gardiner's Hand, then you immediately obÅ¿erve in them juÅ¿t Å¿uch another Change as is made the Å¿ame way in PerÅ¿ons recovered out of a Swoon.</p>
                     <p>For as in this latter CaÅ¿e, PerÅ¿ons in a Swoon recover themÅ¿elves by receiving a little Wine, or Spirits; which Recovery is perform'd by the Nutritive Faculty, which coming to Act upon this new Supply of NouriÅ¿hment, makes uÅ¿e of it as a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and diÅ¿penÅ¿es it out of the Stomach, where it received it, to all the Parts of the Body: JuÅ¿t Å¿o when the <hi>Tree,</hi> which either in a CheÅ¿t, or newly Set, had Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for want of Water, comes to be RefreÅ¿hed by a new Supply of Water, its <hi>Roots,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the extreme Parts of them, being throughly moiÅ¿ten'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, immediately the Vital Principle begins to act again upon the moiÅ¿ten'd Earth, and Å¿ends up a great quantity of Sap, which diÅ¿tributing it Å¿elf into all the Å¿everal Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> its <hi>Boughs, Leaves, Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> puts them all into the very Å¿ame condition they were in before, when for want of moiÅ¿ture the <hi>Roots</hi> gave over Acting.</p>
                     <p>And this it does, provided this CeÅ¿Å¿ation of Action be not too long, which if it be, 'twill kill the <hi>Plant;</hi> the Vital Principle being not able to preÅ¿erve it Å¿elf, if it have not always Å¿omething of moiÅ¿ture to work upon, (which moiÅ¿ture it can have no way, but by the Action of the <hi>Roots;)</hi> juÅ¿t as continual Evacuation, and long AbÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, prove mortal to Animals, which cannot live any conÅ¿iderable time without freÅ¿h Supplies of Food.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis likewiÅ¿e to be obÅ¿erved, That <hi>Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> which are all tender, and Å¿hort-lived, have much more need of conÅ¿tant Supplies of Sap to keep them alive, and to preÅ¿erve their Beauty, then the Stocks, or other Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which being more Å¿olid and maÅ¿Å¿ive, will live a long time, though the Roots Å¿hould perform no Action that might any way advantage them.</p>
                     <p>We are further to note, That though the greateÅ¿t part of the Sap, that is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Roots,</hi> goes up into the upper Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> yet it does not equally at all times make them grow longer; Å¿ometimes it does only, and that too Å¿o as we cannot perceive it, Å¿trengthen its Parts, and enable it to Å¿end forth fairer <hi>Sie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â¢</desc>
                           </gap>s;</hi> whereas when the Sap goes up in a greater abundance, it makes it Å¿hoot out in Length, as we often Å¿ee it does in a double Quantity, at both the <hi>SolÅ¿tices,</hi> and at the <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the laÅ¿t place I hold, That the Vital Principle being duly moved, and quicken'd, Å¿erves as an InÅ¿trument to Enliven, to Strengthen, and to Envigorate the <hi>Roots:</hi> So that the Strength or WeakneÅ¿s of their Action, depends wholly upon the Strength or WeakneÅ¿s of the Motion or ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion they derive from this Principle;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48210:259"/>
as alÅ¿o, That the Vigour and Activity of this Principle being not Infinite, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the Nature of the <hi>Tree</hi> which it is to Enliven, it communicates it Å¿elf to all the <hi>Roots</hi> that depend upon it, and which it is to Actuate, according to their Å¿everal Capacities, as being InÅ¿truments it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily make uÅ¿e of in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of its Office.</p>

                        <p>ConÅ¿iderations upon the Number of <hi>Roots</hi> to be left in the Planting of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom what has been Å¿aid, it evidently follows, that the more Numerous thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> are which depend upon that Principle, Å¿o much a leÅ¿Å¿er Å¿hare of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid Motion and ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion does accrue to each of them in particular.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis moÅ¿t certain, that when only three or four <hi>Roots</hi> receive the whole ImpreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of Å¿uch a certain proportion of Vigor as might have been diÅ¿tributed to a greater Number; each, I Å¿ay, of thoÅ¿e three or four being thereby more plentifully Å¿upplied, doth conÅ¿equently become capable of producing more, than if that ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion had been divided amongÅ¿t a dozen.</p>
                     <p>It is alÅ¿o as certain, that Å¿ince this ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion can never lie uÅ¿eleÅ¿s in that part where it is received; it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily act in proportion to what it is in it Å¿elf, that is either Å¿trongly or weakly, according to its own Strength or WeakneÅ¿s. Now Å¿ince the effect of this ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion upon the <hi>Root</hi> is nothing but the Production of other <hi>Roots;</hi> if the ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion it Å¿elf be weak and feeble, Å¿uch alÅ¿o by conÅ¿equence muÅ¿t the <hi>Roots</hi> be that are produced by it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis upon this ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion that the GoodneÅ¿s and Vigour of theÅ¿e <hi>Roots,</hi> and the continuance of the whole <hi>Tree</hi> in its Beauty, do entirely depend: So that when the <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿ucceed well, and exert themÅ¿elves Å¿trongly, the <hi>Tree</hi> cannot fail of thriving both in its Trunk and Branches; as, on the contrary, if the <hi>Roots</hi> do not take well, the <hi>Tree</hi> will of neceÅ¿Å¿ity grow but very poorly.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: Since every one that Plants in a good Soil, propoÅ¿es to himÅ¿elf the RaiÅ¿ing a <hi>Tree</hi> as Å¿oon as may be, that Å¿hall be Vigorous, and capable of being long Liv'd. He muÅ¿t take Å¿pecial Care Å¿o to order it in the Setting, as to make it in a little time put forth Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e good new <hi>Roots,</hi> Å¿ince it is from them only that he can expect the AccompliÅ¿hment of his DeÅ¿ires.</p>
                     <p>Now for the better attaining of this, it is to be conÅ¿idered, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That although there are few <hi>Trees</hi> Planted, but what have Å¿ome of theÅ¿e <hi>Roots;</hi> yet they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Advantage from them, whatever their Number be, if thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿oon after they are Planted do not produce new ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> You muÅ¿t take notice, that it is from theÅ¿e thick and Å¿trong new-grown <hi>Roots,</hi> that <hi>Trees</hi> become fair, great, thick Leav'd, and firmly Rooted in the Ground; whereas thoÅ¿e new <hi>Roots</hi> which are Å¿mall and feeble, act but very weakly, and always diÅ¿cover the Symptoms of their Infirmity, either in the Leaves or Branches of the Trees belonging to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> TheÅ¿e thick and hard new <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿hoot forth only from two Places, <hi>viz.</hi> Either from the very Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which rarely happens; or elÅ¿e, as is moÅ¿t uÅ¿ual, from Å¿ome other thick and Å¿trong old <hi>Roots:</hi> For, as I have obÅ¿erved before, Å¿uch <hi>Roots</hi> as are Å¿mall and feeble, can only produce others as feeble as themÅ¿elves, and therefore not likely to turn to any account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve, that even of thoÅ¿e old, thick, and hard <hi>Roots,</hi> from which only you are to expect Å¿uch new ones to Å¿hoot out as you deÅ¿ire, Å¿ome are much better than others. The beÅ¿t, and principally to be choÅ¿en, are thoÅ¿e of the lateÅ¿t Growth out of the foot of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and they are eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by their Å¿mooth and reddiÅ¿h Skin from thoÅ¿e that are older, which always look black, rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and full of wrinkles; whereby you will preÅ¿ently diÅ¿cover them to be unfit for uÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Å¿ort of good <hi>Roots</hi> cannot be produced, but by virtue of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion proceeding from the Vital Principle of the <hi>Tree;</hi> and this ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion will be Å¿o much the more Å¿trong and active, the fewer you leave of thoÅ¿e old <hi>Roots</hi> amongÅ¿t which it is to be divided.</p>
                     <p>You muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve likewiÅ¿e, that this ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion will be the more effectual, the nearer it is made to the Principle from which it proceeds. But this NearneÅ¿s is not to be Å¿trictly and abÅ¿olutely underÅ¿tood, but with Å¿uch a ReÅ¿triction, as when we Å¿ay, A good Eye can better diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h Objects which are near, than thoÅ¿e which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48210:259"/>
are remote; Å¿ince it is well obÅ¿erved by the PhiloÅ¿ophers, That all Extremes are to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> 'Tis to be obÅ¿erved, that theÅ¿e good new <hi>Roots</hi> by which the <hi>Trees</hi> are Å¿trongly faÅ¿ten'd in the Ground, and plentifully nouriÅ¿hed, generally Å¿hoot forth at the ends of the old <hi>Roots;</hi> provided they are not left of too great a Length, or planted above a Foot deep.</p>
                     <p>For you will find, that of theÅ¿e new <hi>Roots</hi> of the later Shoot, thoÅ¿e which grow at a greater diÅ¿tance from the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> are generally more lively, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently of greater Virtue, than thoÅ¿e that grow nearer to it; which are always obÅ¿erved to be Å¿omewhat Å¿maller than the others.</p>
                     <p>Now Å¿ince the Extremities of the old <hi>Roots</hi> muÅ¿t not be too far diÅ¿tant from the <hi>Trunk,</hi> becauÅ¿e then the <hi>Tree</hi> will not be able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the force of the Wind: It will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to cut all of them in general Å¿omewhat Å¿horter, as their Strength or WeakneÅ¿s will permit; that is, the weaker <hi>Roots</hi> may have more cut from them, but the Å¿tronger may admit of a greater length. Taking this as a General Rule: That the <hi>Roots</hi> of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t and largeÅ¿t <hi>Trees</hi> ought not to be left above 9 or 12 Inches long; but for the weaker, it will be enough to leave Å¿ome of them 2, and to others 5 or 6 Inches at moÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e Things being premiÅ¿ed, our <hi>Gardiner</hi> muÅ¿t remember, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That to make a <hi>Tree</hi> which is planted in a good Soil thrive well, he muÅ¿t retain thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> only which appear PromiÅ¿ing, Young, and of a Å¿ufficient BigneÅ¿s; and conÅ¿equently cut off all the Rags, and Å¿uch as we call <hi>Hairy Roots;</hi> as likewiÅ¿e all that through Age are worn out, rotten, or abandon'd by the Sap, which abandoning you may eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cover by this Sign, namely, When Å¿ome younger, larger, and fairer <hi>Roots</hi> Å¿hoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap> out above the old ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It muÅ¿t be allowed, (which yet, as I have already hinted, is not to be Å¿trictly and literally underÅ¿tood,) that how Å¿mall Å¿oever the Number of <hi>Roots</hi> is which you retain, it will be Å¿ufficient for receiving the whole Virtue of the <hi>Tree</hi>'s Vital Principle, and Å¿o become capable of producing Å¿uch new <hi>Roots</hi> as may be good and Å¿erviceable, Å¿o that oftentimes he muÅ¿t be contented with one Å¿ingle <hi>Root,</hi> if all the reÅ¿t do not prove good; Å¿ometimes he may keep 2 or 3, or 4 or 5 at moÅ¿t, all of them Å¿eparated at a due diÅ¿tance from each other: TheÅ¿e altogether make up what we call a <hi>Bed</hi> or <hi>Lay of Roots,</hi> and when they happen to be Å¿o many, muÅ¿t, in the Planting your <hi>Tree</hi> about a Foot deep, be diÅ¿poÅ¿ed Å¿o far below the Surface of the Ground, as may Å¿ecure them from being killed either by Heat, Cold, or the Stroke of a Spade, (and for this, 8 or 9 Inches will be enough) but yet not Å¿o deep as to hinder them from enjoying of the comfortable warmth of the Sun, or Å¿o much of the Earth's moiÅ¿ture as is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for their NouriÅ¿hment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> Let him reÅ¿t fully aÅ¿Å¿ured, that if a young <hi>Tree</hi> thus planted, with a few, and thoÅ¿e but Å¿hort <hi>Roots</hi> left upon it, do not thrive in the two firÅ¿t Years; it would certainly have Å¿ucceeded no better, though he had left it more <hi>Roots,</hi> and of greater length. So that without loÅ¿ing any more time in a fruitleÅ¿s Expectation, to which all <hi>Gardiners</hi> are extremely Å¿ubject, let him reÅ¿olve with all convenient Å¿peed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Directions here preÅ¿cribed, to Plant another good <hi>Tree</hi> in the room of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have given you the <hi>Rules</hi> for Planting, which I had propoÅ¿ed to my Å¿elf, with relation both to the <hi>Tree</hi> and the <hi>Soil;</hi> by the ObÅ¿ervation of which, the <hi>Tree</hi> will put forth good new <hi>Roots,</hi> whereby that NouriÅ¿hment is conveyed to it which cauÅ¿es it to thrive as well in the Body as Branches, and makes it continue vigorous, and every Year to bring forth plentifully both Leaves and Fruit.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR the better IlluÅ¿tration how that NouriÅ¿hment, which in the Spring begins to enter into each <hi>Root,</hi> is at the Å¿ame inÅ¿tant of time diÅ¿tributed into the Trunk, Branches, Leaves, and Fruit of the <hi>Tree.</hi> I cannot think of any fitter or more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructive CompariÅ¿on than that of a Torch, which, as Å¿oon as it is lighted in the midÅ¿t of a dark Room, does in a moment, and at once, diffuÅ¿e its Light in its whole Circumference, in every place of the Room wherever it can reach.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Sap</hi> being a Liquid, Light, and Subtil Body, which, as well as all Vapours and Exhalations, Å¿eems to participate of the Nature of Air, and conÅ¿equently to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48210:260"/>
have its Centre in the upper, rather than in the lower Parts: The ReÅ¿emblance in the Å¿ubtility of their matter, which Å¿eems to be found between <hi>Sap</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> will, I hope, make my CompariÅ¿on allowable.</p>
                     <p>But how far Å¿oever it may hold in Å¿ome ReÅ¿pects, yet I am very Å¿enÅ¿ible there is a conÅ¿iderable difference in others. For as <hi>Light</hi> diffuÅ¿es its Å¿trongeÅ¿t emiÅ¿Å¿ions upon thoÅ¿e parts of the Air that are neareÅ¿t to the Luminous Body, which is their Source and Original CauÅ¿e, Å¿o likewiÅ¿e it grows Å¿enÅ¿ibly Weaker in the Remoter Parts, in proportion to their greater or leÅ¿Å¿er diÅ¿tance from that Source. And this is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Order of Nature, which hath determined every Agent to a certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Sphere of Activity, and to Act more powerfully upon thoÅ¿e Objects that are at a ReaÅ¿onable diÅ¿tance, than upon Å¿uch as being further off, are in Å¿ome manner out of its reach.</p>
                     <p>But now on the contrary, the <hi>Sap</hi> produces its moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable Effects, in thoÅ¿e Parts which are fartheÅ¿t diÅ¿tant from the <hi>Roots,</hi> from which it is originally deriv'd. For having a Natural tendency to raiÅ¿e it Å¿elf, with impetuoÅ¿ity to the Extremities of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which are its proper Centre; it only makes a quick and brisk PaÅ¿Å¿age through all the other Parts, which are the Channels to convey it to that Centre.</p>
                     <p>We find then, That the Sap which is prepared by the <hi>Roots</hi> in the Ground, makes its firÅ¿t Entrance in great Plenty into theÅ¿e Extremities of the <hi>Branches;</hi> the other parts of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> tho' nearer to the <hi>Trunk,</hi> receive no benefit from that <hi>Sap,</hi> but proportionably as they lye nearer, or farther from the <hi>Spring</hi> which produced it. The only Advantage the Lower parts of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> can get from it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds merely from the abode which that <hi>Sap,</hi> in its continual AÅ¿cent towards thoÅ¿e Extremities, is Å¿ometimes forced to make in the Neighbourhood of thoÅ¿e Lower parts. This abode happens, when that which was already come up of the firÅ¿t <hi>Sap,</hi> being not able to break out Å¿oon enough to be employed in putting forth <hi>Branches, Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> is a hindrance to the Attempt of that which comes after it, and conÅ¿equently Å¿topping it by the way; for a while makes it tarry at Å¿ome diÅ¿tance from thoÅ¿e extremities, till the paÅ¿Å¿age be opened for it, to iÅ¿Å¿ue out as the foregoing <hi>Sap</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>And methinks, This Å¿eems to have a great ReÅ¿emblance with what often happens in a Stream, that is Å¿topt in its deÅ¿cent by Å¿ome Dam. This Stream haÅ¿tening to its Centre beyond that Dam, runs continually toward it, with all the Å¿wiftneÅ¿s that the preÅ¿Å¿ure of its own Weight can afford it. In the mean time, all the New Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which flows every moment from the Å¿ame Spring, from whence both of them are deriv'd, Å¿triving naturally to follow the CourÅ¿e of the foregoing, which iÅ¿Å¿ued out firÅ¿t; 'tis intercepted in its paÅ¿Å¿age by that firÅ¿t, Å¿o as it cannot reach even the Dam; by reaÅ¿on that the firÅ¿t having as it were Å¿eized upon that principal PoÅ¿t, hinders it from flowing any further, juÅ¿t in the Å¿ame manner as the Dam hindred the flowing of the firÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>From hence it comes to paÅ¿s, FirÅ¿t, That both being Å¿o Å¿topt, there is a great Conflux of Water made in a certain Tract of Land. Secondly, That thoÅ¿e parts of that Water, which are moÅ¿t diÅ¿tant from the Dam, dilate themÅ¿elves on every Å¿ide, and conÅ¿equently Wet, NouriÅ¿h, and even Drown Å¿ometimes the <hi>Plants</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on its <hi>Banks,</hi> which would have been neither Watered nor NouriÅ¿hed, could that Water inÅ¿tead of meeting with the Å¿aid Dam, have freely arrived whither its own Declivity would have carried it.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the <hi>Sap</hi> whoÅ¿e Source is in the <hi>Roots,</hi> having a natural propenÅ¿ion to RiÅ¿e up to the Extremities of the <hi>Branches,</hi> to which it tends as its own Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, is, as we have already Å¿aid, Å¿ometimes Å¿topt far enough from its deÅ¿igned mark, by that which aÅ¿cended firÅ¿t, and which had not time enough by iÅ¿Å¿uing forth to compleat its intended Work.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sap</hi> which aÅ¿cended laÅ¿t, continues never Å¿o little in the place where it is Å¿topp'd, it never fails of producing Å¿ome New Effect, which Å¿hews it has been Å¿topp'd there: for its abode is never uÅ¿eleÅ¿s wherever it be; and the Effects produced by it are theÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Where it is in great Plenty, as it uÅ¿ually is in the <hi>Trunk</hi> and bigger <hi>Branches,</hi> the more Active parts of it which are got neareÅ¿t to that which AÅ¿cended firÅ¿t, are prepared there in Å¿ome MeaÅ¿ure, to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t that which came up firÅ¿t, in putting forth New <hi>Branches,</hi> differing in their bigneÅ¿s and number, according to its plenty: (in what Order theÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> are produced, I Å¿hall explain hereafter) but that which is leÅ¿s Vigorous, doth the Å¿ame every where about it, which a Å¿mall quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> appears to do in <hi>Branches</hi> of a leÅ¿Å¿er Size; <hi>Viz.</hi> Both of them Form

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR the better UnderÅ¿tanding this Maxim, it is to be obÅ¿erved, That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of it Relates to thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> which tho' they grow Å¿ometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bigger <hi>Branches,</hi> yet it is only in the parts which are fartheÅ¿t diÅ¿tant from their Extremities, that is to Å¿ay in the loweÅ¿t part of the <hi>Branch:</hi> The Second part of it is concerning the <hi>Buds</hi> that grow upon the Weak <hi>Branches,</hi> in a place quite contrary to that of the big ones; <hi>Viz.</hi> In the very Extremities of them.</p>
                     <p>There are then, as you have already heard, two Å¿orts of <hi>Branches,</hi> Strong and Weak, upon each of which theÅ¿e <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> are formed; and I think I may preÅ¿ume to Å¿ay, That the <hi>Sap</hi> which is diffuÅ¿ed through the whole extent of thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches,</hi> makes there as it were a Body of <hi>Sap:</hi> I am forced to expreÅ¿s my Å¿elf in theÅ¿e Terms, to render my Maxim more intelligible.</p>
                     <p>There is no queÅ¿tion to be made, as I have before intimated, but that a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportion of that <hi>Sap</hi> riÅ¿es up to the Extremity of all Å¿orts of <hi>Branches,</hi> than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it in any other parts.</p>
                     <p>Now I give the Name of <hi>Strong,</hi> as well to the whole <hi>Branch</hi> that is big and Å¿trong, as to that part of all Å¿orts of <hi>Branches</hi> whatÅ¿oever, where the <hi>Sap</hi> is gathered in a greater quantity.</p>
                     <p>And I call <hi>Weak,</hi> as well the whole <hi>Branch</hi> whether Å¿mall and weak, as that part of any Å¿ort of <hi>Branches</hi> whatÅ¿oever, which partakes of that <hi>Sap</hi> in a leÅ¿Å¿er quantity.</p>
                     <p>This being Å¿uppos'd, I poÅ¿itively affirm, that in the big and Å¿trong <hi>Branches,</hi> where there is a greater confluence of <hi>Sap,</hi> that <hi>Sap</hi> forcing it Å¿elf upward to their Extremities, is conÅ¿equently convey'd thither in great Plenty. But that abundance as great as it is, may be fit to cauÅ¿e the putting forth many <hi>Branches,</hi> but is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the making of <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi> For experience tells us, that theÅ¿e are never brought forth, but in thoÅ¿e places where there is a juÅ¿t proportion of <hi>Sap, Viz.</hi> Neither too much nor too little.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis for this ReaÅ¿on probably, That we never Å¿ee any <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> growing at the Prun'd or Lopp'd Extremity of a big <hi>Branch,</hi> except when the <hi>Sap</hi> has been diverted by Å¿ome unknown ObÅ¿tacle, from RiÅ¿ing up to it altogether, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its uÅ¿ual CourÅ¿e; but upon the lower parts of the <hi>Branch,</hi> where the <hi>Sap</hi> is neither Å¿o plentiful nor Å¿o Å¿tirring, they are frequently produced.</p>
                     <p>And this is the ReaÅ¿on, that induced me to lay down this as a Maxim, <hi>That the</hi> Fruit-buds <hi>grow Å¿ometimes upon the Weak of the Strong;</hi> That is to Å¿ay <hi>upon the Weak</hi> part of the <hi>Strong Branch,</hi> where by <hi>Weak,</hi> the lower part of the <hi>Branch</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood; foraÅ¿much, as there being really much leÅ¿s <hi>Sap</hi> in the lower, than in the upper part, or Extremity of the <hi>Branch,</hi> it has by conÅ¿equence a greater diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, to bring forth thoÅ¿e lovely <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> which Å¿o juÅ¿tly challenge our Admiration.</p>
                     <p>The former part of this Maxim being well underÅ¿tood, there will remain no great difficulty in the latter; Å¿o that when I Å¿ay, That <hi>the</hi> Fruit-buds <hi>grow Å¿ometimes upon the Strong of the Weak</hi> the meaning is plain, that they Å¿hoot out at the extremity of the <hi>weak Branches,</hi> wherein, tho' indeed there is but a Å¿mall quantity of <hi>Sap,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿on of what is to be found in the big ones, yet there is more of it in the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than in any other parts of the Å¿ame <hi>Branches,</hi> and therefore enough to make up the juÅ¿t meaÅ¿ure, which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the Frame or Conformation of thoÅ¿e <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi> And this is the true ReaÅ¿on, why the middle Å¿iz'd <hi>Branches</hi> that are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too big nor too little, are commonly firÅ¿t loaded with <hi>Fruit-buds;</hi> the firÅ¿t years they begin to put out <hi>Buds</hi> at their ends, then continue from year to year to bring them forth in their whole length, but afterwards they Å¿hift from one part to another,

Å¿till drawing back by degrees nearer to that big <hi>Branch</hi> out of which they Å¿prung, till at laÅ¿t they come to bear in that which is neareÅ¿t to the place from whence they had their firÅ¿t Production.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have obÅ¿erved elÅ¿ewhere, in DiÅ¿courÅ¿ing of the means to prevent the ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, to which the <hi>Fruit-bearing Branches</hi> are Subject, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Branches</hi> never laÅ¿t long in any <hi>Trees:</hi> But that in <hi>Stone-Fruits,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially in <hi>Peaches,</hi> they never bear twice Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively in the Å¿ame place. Commonly they die in the very year of their bearing, which is the following year after their Å¿hooting forth. But if any of them eÅ¿cape, the ReaÅ¿on is, that being grown a little bigger than they were, they put forth out at their Extremities, Å¿ome other Fruitful <hi>Branches</hi> againÅ¿t the next year; but after that time they become Dry and UÅ¿eleÅ¿s, and by conÅ¿equence muÅ¿t be cut off.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Core-Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> laÅ¿t Å¿omewhat longer, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> continue bearing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Length 5 or 6 years Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively, till at laÅ¿t they fall by the Common Fate of <hi>Fruit-bearing Branches,</hi> that is to periÅ¿h by their own FruitfulneÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>It is not improbable, but that the Å¿ame thing may be Å¿aid, in Relation to the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theÅ¿e <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> that is generally obÅ¿erv'd in the <hi>Fruits</hi> themÅ¿elves, which decay conÅ¿tantly in a certain time; and the ReÅ¿emblance between them, is, in my Opinion, well enough Grounded, to admit the CompariÅ¿on. For as the firÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or mark of Corruption in <hi>Fruits,</hi> is the perfection of their RipeneÅ¿s; that is to Å¿ay, they are then neareÅ¿t to Corruption, when they have attained their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Maturity; Å¿o likewiÅ¿e in the <hi>Branches</hi> their beginning to bear, is the firÅ¿t Sign of their approaching DeÅ¿truction; that is to Å¿ay, according to the Common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> they begin to die, juÅ¿t in the Å¿ame Moment, that they begin to bear <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to give Å¿ome probable ReaÅ¿on of this particular DeÅ¿truction; it cannot be Å¿aid, That the <hi>Fruit-bearing Branch</hi> deÅ¿troys it Å¿elf, Å¿eeing it hath no peculiar Action diÅ¿tinct from the general Action of the Plant, whoÅ¿e great End is Å¿elf-preÅ¿ervation. It is then more to the purpoÅ¿e, I conceive to Å¿ay, that thoÅ¿e Parts <hi>(Viz.</hi> The <hi>Weak Branches)</hi> through which that Å¿mall quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> paÅ¿Å¿eth, which makes the <hi>Fruit,</hi> being not Å¿tored with a Å¿ufficient quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> to Å¿trengthen themÅ¿elves, and to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the injuries of the Air, do firÅ¿t begin to dry up inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly, and Å¿oon after whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wither and Dye: Whereas the other parts which are furniÅ¿h'd with it in greater Plenty; <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Strong, Thick,</hi> and <hi>Vigorous Branches,</hi> being daily Å¿upplied with New <hi>Sap,</hi> and thereby Fortified againÅ¿t the Injuries of the Air, have alÅ¿o the good luck of a longer continuance.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is a QueÅ¿tion that has extreamly puzled the Curious, to explain the inward Frame of theÅ¿e <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> and I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s, that the Contexture and Arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of thoÅ¿e little Leaves enfolded in one another, which make up thoÅ¿e <hi>Buds</hi> and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h them from the other parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> are an ample Subject for a very Curious but difficult diÅ¿quiÅ¿ition; and I Å¿hould be extreamly glad to Arrive at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect underÅ¿tanding of this wonderful MaÅ¿ter-piece of Nature.</p>
                     <p>But after having a great deal of pains to little purpoÅ¿e, I am forced to acquieÅ¿ce and Å¿atisfie my CurioÅ¿ity, by Å¿aying plainly and in the general, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Buds</hi> may probably be formed, almoÅ¿t after the Å¿ame manner, with <hi>Cabbages</hi> and Loaf'd <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces.</hi> Let us Å¿ee then, whether we can unfold the MyÅ¿tery of thoÅ¿e, and thereby attain to the knowledge of the other.</p>
                     <p>To find how far this CompariÅ¿on will hold, we muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that of the Å¿everal Species of Plants, there are Å¿ome which commonly do but Å¿hoot forth outwardly, that is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48210:261"/>
they only lengthen and extend their Extremities. Of this Å¿ort are Å¿uch as either grow upright, for InÅ¿tance, <hi>Trees, AÅ¿paragus, Artichokes;</hi> or Å¿uch as creep upon the Ground, as <hi>Melons, Gourds, Ivy,</hi> and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others there are which for a while do only Å¿hoot inwardly, to get a firmer and more compacted SubÅ¿tance, till at laÅ¿t they take the Å¿ame way with the former; for InÅ¿tance, All Å¿uch as are of an Orbicular Figure, as <hi>Cabbages, Loaf'd Lettuces,</hi> and even thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants</hi> which are tied together to make them grow white, as <hi>Chicorees, &amp;c.</hi> ThoÅ¿e of the former kind Å¿hoot only at the Extremities of what was grown before; the others rarely Å¿hoot but only juÅ¿t round about their Center, in the Å¿ame manner almoÅ¿t as we Å¿ee Water Å¿pringing up in the Å¿ource of a Fountain.</p>
                     <p>Having premiÅ¿ed this: I Å¿ay, That as <hi>Cabbage</hi> and <hi>Lettuces</hi> cannot grow round when their Root is too vigorous; that exceÅ¿s of Vigor cauÅ¿ing them to grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in their Stem as much as their Å¿trength will allow, and at laÅ¿t cauÅ¿ing them to run up to Seed, when their Å¿trength is much exhauÅ¿ted; Å¿o likewiÅ¿e Å¿carce any <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> can be produced on <hi>Trees</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> too much invigorated by the Sap, that exceÅ¿s of it cauÅ¿ing them to exert themÅ¿elves in length inÅ¿tead of growing round, as it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary they Å¿hould do to become really <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A certain Mediocrity then of Vigor is requiÅ¿ite in thoÅ¿e kinds of <hi>Plants,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their growing Round and Headed, as there muÅ¿t be a certain Mediocrity of Sap in <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> to produce <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to underÅ¿tand after what manner thoÅ¿e Heads are framed in <hi>Cabbages</hi> and <hi>Lettuces,</hi> it is to be obÅ¿erved, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That thoÅ¿e outward Coats and Leaves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly firÅ¿t produced in thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants,</hi> and have their Formation begun as Å¿oon as the <hi>Plants</hi> themÅ¿elves. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That of all thoÅ¿e Leaves firÅ¿t produced, there uÅ¿ually remain but few, which growing proportionably to the DimenÅ¿ions of the <hi>Cabbage</hi> or <hi>Lettuce,</hi> Å¿erve for Ramparts and BaÅ¿tions to defend the Nobler Parts lying inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t, and which are, as it were, the Cittadel or Magazine of the Place.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes to paÅ¿s, that Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e old outward Leaves, either by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct of Nature, or the <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s InduÅ¿try, contracting their Extremities very cloÅ¿e to one another, do form a kind of Natural Girdle, or Cap as it were, which entirely covers and encloÅ¿es the Heart and InÅ¿ide of thoÅ¿e <hi>Plants;</hi> which being the Seat of their Vital Principle, and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by the Action of the <hi>Roots</hi> which are produced by it, and reÅ¿embling, as we have Å¿aid already, the <hi>Spring</hi> of a <hi>Fountain,</hi> Å¿hoots continually from its whole Circumference an infinite number of Å¿mall Productions, which become Å¿o many Å¿mall Leaves.</p>
                     <p>Now theÅ¿e being confined, and hindred from Å¿preading abroad, enfold and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themÅ¿elves for a while one within another, till they grow Å¿trong enough to break open the Bars which reÅ¿train them in Å¿o narrow a compaÅ¿s, and violently to force their way out: And becauÅ¿e they are not expoÅ¿ed to the Injuries of the Air, they remain tender, delicate, and white; as alÅ¿o being very numerous, and having but little room, they draw Å¿o cloÅ¿e together, that at laÅ¿t they become a hard and Å¿olid Body. And this is what is called <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and <hi>Loaf'd-Lettuces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is not improbable, but that <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> are formed juÅ¿t in the Å¿ame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as thoÅ¿e <hi>Headed Cabbages.</hi> Without queÅ¿tion 'tis partly the Frame and Figure which makes the difference of their Denominations. In <hi>Trees,</hi> that Å¿mall, blackiÅ¿h, Å¿harp-topped RoundneÅ¿s which both makes, and encloÅ¿es the bloÅ¿Å¿om, is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed <hi>Bud,</hi> than Head; as in <hi>Cabbage</hi> and <hi>Lettuce,</hi> their bigneÅ¿s and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s cauÅ¿es them to be more fitly Å¿tyled Heads, than <hi>Buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am of opinion, That <hi>Onions</hi> are formed within the Ground almoÅ¿t after the Å¿ame manner as the Heads of <hi>Cabbages</hi> and <hi>Lettuce</hi> are upon the Å¿urface of it.</p>
                     <p>Now as thoÅ¿e <hi>Onions, Cabbages,</hi> and <hi>Lettuce,</hi> when they are Å¿upplied with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional encreaÅ¿e of <hi>Sap,</hi> begin to diÅ¿cloÅ¿e themÅ¿elves, and to put forth that which they had a long time contained hidden within: JuÅ¿t Å¿o the <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> having in the Spring received an inward EncreaÅ¿e, as well by Rarefaction of their former <hi>Sap,</hi> as their new NouriÅ¿hment, burÅ¿t out, and diÅ¿cloÅ¿e at laÅ¿t that <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om</hi> which carries in it the <hi>Embrio,</hi> or firÅ¿t beginning of the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That firÅ¿t beginning of the <hi>Fruit</hi> is a very Å¿mall Particle, encloÅ¿ed in the Heart of the <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿om,</hi> wherein is contained the <hi>Seed</hi> from which the <hi>Fruit</hi> is produced; nor does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them receive their Formation till the decreaÅ¿ing of the Heat, and deÅ¿cent of the <hi>Sap</hi> of the foregoing Summer. The temperate Warmth of the Spring aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ts the <hi>Tree</hi> in bringing to perfection what was but juÅ¿t begun, at once gratifying the <hi>Gardiner</hi> with the agreeable Object of his Hopes and DeÅ¿ires, and giving Nature an opportunity of multiplying its Productions.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon other Effects of the <hi>Sap</hi> relating to the Thickning and Lengthning of the Branches.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Come now to Å¿peak again of thoÅ¿e Effects which owe their Being to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Sap in Å¿ome particular Parts of the <hi>Trees,</hi> and theÅ¿e are in my Opinion evidently demonÅ¿trated by the InÅ¿tance of thoÅ¿e <hi>Willow-tops</hi> that grow to an extraordinary bigneÅ¿s in compariÅ¿on of their Trunk, which undoubtedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from hence, That their Top-branches being often Lopp'd off near the place of their Å¿hooting out, the Sap riÅ¿ing up to it in its uÅ¿ual courÅ¿e, cannot iÅ¿Å¿ue out Å¿o Å¿oon as it is arrived there, but is forced to tarry there for Å¿ome time, and Å¿o Å¿tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and incorporating it Å¿elf in part to that place where it is Å¿topp'd, it cauÅ¿es that Head to grow much bigger than all the reÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Parts through which it only makes a quick PaÅ¿Å¿age.</p>
                     <p>It may be Å¿aid, and perhaps reaÅ¿onably enough, that the Sap cauÅ¿es-the bigneÅ¿s of the Branches in <hi>Trees,</hi> and the Leaves in all other <hi>Plants,</hi> almoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame manner, as the melted Wax doth in <hi>Tapers, Flambeaux</hi> and <hi>Torches,</hi> with this difference only, (which yet doth not alter the CompariÅ¿on) That the Sap riÅ¿esup between the Wood and the Bark, aÅ¿piring to the Center of light Bodies; whereas on the contrary, the melted Wax runs downward along the Å¿uÅ¿pended Wyck, becauÅ¿e it tends to the Center of heavy Bodies: And if it happens that any of that melted Wax Å¿tays any longer in one part than in another, it will not fail of producing the Å¿ame Effect that the Sap doth in the Extremities of <hi>maimed Trees.</hi> I cannot find any thing in <hi>Mechanics</hi> fitter to give a lively RepreÅ¿entation, how Sap, though Liquid it Å¿elf, can contribute to the thickning a Solid Body by that Solidity which it Å¿elf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; for it really grows thick as it were, by Å¿o many Coats Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively enfolded one over another, as is obvious enough to the Eye of him that doth but conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the extremity of any Stump of a <hi>Tree,</hi> or that views the Structure of <hi>Onions, RadiÅ¿hes,</hi> and other Roots, when cut through the middle.</p>
                     <p>But now as to the ExtenÅ¿ion of the Branches of <hi>Trees,</hi> and Leaves of every <hi>Plant;</hi> (which is made in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> By the new Parts drawing nearer to the old ones, there is Å¿o cloÅ¿e an Union made, and, to Å¿peak PhiloÅ¿ophically, Å¿uch an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and individual Incorporation, that it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible either to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h them by the Eye, or to unfold and Å¿eparate them from one another.) I Å¿ay then, as to this ExtenÅ¿ion of Branches, the new Sap muÅ¿t needs have in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of mollifying and melting the hard Extremity of each Branch, and Trunk, of the former Year's Growth, that Å¿o it may unite the new Liquid with the old Solid, and conÅ¿titute a Body altogether like, Å¿o as that the leaÅ¿t difference cannot be perceived between them.</p>
                     <p>I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s, this is a Point that Å¿eems to me worthy of the higheÅ¿t Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor has the utmoÅ¿t of Humane InduÅ¿try ever yet attained to any Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance comparable to that Imperceptible ExtenÅ¿ion of Branches: For though the <hi>Painters</hi> Colours laid on at Å¿everal times, and the Solder which <hi>GoldÅ¿miths</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> make uÅ¿e of, afford us Å¿ome Å¿aint ReÅ¿emblance of it; yet we muÅ¿t have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e to Å¿ome other Effect of Nature, to give us a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of this Å¿o perfect an Union. For InÅ¿tance; That of <hi>Ice,</hi> which by the Å¿harpneÅ¿s of the Cold is formed over all Å¿orts of Water, as we Å¿ee it in the BaÅ¿in of a Fountain. 'Tis true, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of that Water which was Congeled to day, cannot abÅ¿olutely be diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed from the inner Parts of that Water which will be Congeled to morrow, and Å¿o Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively from one Part to another, as the Cold continues to have a Å¿tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Influence upon them: But the compariÅ¿on of <hi>Gutters</hi> in which the Icicles grow longer, proportionably as the Cold of the Air becomes more intenÅ¿e, repreÅ¿ents Å¿till more clearly, that lengthning of Branches which we can Å¿o difficultly Å¿olve in <hi>Trees,</hi> for to give an account how thoÅ¿e Knots and Eyes come to be Å¿o artificially
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48210:262"/>
placed at certain DiÅ¿tances, and to be Å¿o beautifully adorned with Leaves and Fruits, is beyond the Limits of our UnderÅ¿tanding.</p>
                     <p>But however, neither of theÅ¿e CompariÅ¿ons will Å¿ignifie much to us, unleÅ¿s there happen in the interval, from one day to another to be Å¿ome abatement of Cold, Å¿o as it may certainly appear, that there has been Å¿ome relenting of the FroÅ¿t: For when that continues without any intermiÅ¿Å¿ion, it has a like effect in the Water du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the extremity of Winter, that the Sap has in the extended Branches during the Heats of the Spring and Summer. The only difficulty lies in the firÅ¿t Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, which happens at the end of the Winter; and this ariÅ¿es from the Å¿tirring activity in the Liquid Sap, which riÅ¿es up anew to the extremity of the hard and Å¿olid Branches of the preceding Year.</p>
                     <p>And here we may obÅ¿erve, That a Tree is eaÅ¿ily to be cleft lengthways, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Head to the Foot, or from Foot to Head, as if in that PoÅ¿ition the <hi>Fibres,</hi> of which its Trunk conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, were in Å¿ome manner like Threads wrapped cloÅ¿e one over another: But to take it breadthways or acroÅ¿s from one Å¿ide to the other, 'tis very difficult to cleave it. For the Å¿everal Parts are Å¿o compacted and linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that each of them Å¿eems to make a little All, perfect and entire in it Å¿elf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Separation be made of it, but by means of a Å¿harp-edg'd Tool.</p>
                     <p>What Effects are produced by the continuance of the Sap, are yet more fully demonÅ¿trated by its contrary, namely by the too quick PaÅ¿Å¿age of it, as it happens, (eÅ¿pecially in any Å¿ort of <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> whether <hi>Core</hi> or <hi>Stone-Fruit)</hi> when the Sap follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its uÅ¿ual CourÅ¿e, which is to aÅ¿cend by regular Steps to the extremities of the Branches, doth in its PaÅ¿Å¿age open to it Å¿elf an indirect and extraordinary way into Å¿ome other part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and in few days puts forth what we call <hi>Suckers</hi> or <hi>FalÅ¿e Shoots.</hi> The <hi>Sap,</hi> I Å¿ay, being thus diÅ¿ordered, and making its EÅ¿cape with Å¿ome Å¿ort of Violence, burÅ¿ts out and riÅ¿es with an impetuous force, and during that firÅ¿t Effort, makes no Å¿tay in its PaÅ¿Å¿age.</p>
                     <p>From hence it comes to paÅ¿s, that thoÅ¿e Eyes which are neareÅ¿t that breaking out are very far diÅ¿tant from one another, are flat and ill nouriÅ¿hed, Å¿o as to be Å¿carcely diÅ¿cernible: But when the violence of that firÅ¿t Effort is Å¿omewhat abated, the <hi>Sap</hi> returns to its ordinary pace, and Å¿eems to have its regular PauÅ¿es; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it both forms thoÅ¿e Eyes nearer to each other, and affords them better NouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that while the lower Parts are accounted uÅ¿eleÅ¿s and falÅ¿e Wood, the upper on the contrary prove fruitful and well condition'd.</p>
                     <p>The Reader perhaps may think, I have inÅ¿iÅ¿ted too long upon this CompariÅ¿on between <hi>Sap</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> but as I could not explain my Notion more briefly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that extream quickneÅ¿s wherewith the <hi>Sap,</hi> after its being prepared by the <hi>Roots,</hi> Å¿eems as it were to fly to all the extremities of the Branches, Å¿o I wiÅ¿h that even thus I may have the good fortune to be underÅ¿tood.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall now proceed to give another InÅ¿tance, wherein a lighted <hi>Torch</hi> and the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> have a mutual Analogy or ReÅ¿emblance, for a further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Opinion, concerning the different Operation of the <hi>Roots</hi> in relation to the <hi>Sap,</hi> which cauÅ¿es the Thickening, Lengthening, and indeed the UniverÅ¿al Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenÅ¿ion of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For as a Luminous Body, the bigger and brighter it is, the farther will it diffuÅ¿e its Light; juÅ¿t Å¿o thoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> that are thickeÅ¿t, hardeÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t vigorous in their Operation, do force up higheÅ¿t that <hi>Sap</hi> or NouriÅ¿hment that is prepared by them.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is very eaÅ¿ie to give a ReaÅ¿on how the Extremities of Å¿ome <hi>Trees</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> come to die, which certainly in my Opinion is nothing elÅ¿e but only the want of Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e Å¿ubÅ¿tantial and Å¿trong <hi>Roots</hi> growing out of the foot of the <hi>Tree;</hi> whence conÅ¿equently it happens, that there is not <hi>Sap</hi> enough prepared to riÅ¿e up Å¿o high as it uÅ¿ed to do, either in former Years, or even in that very SeaÅ¿on wherein this Defect was obÅ¿erved.</p>
                     <p>For InÅ¿tance: The <hi>Sap</hi> that in other Years uÅ¿ed to riÅ¿e 3 or 4 Fathoms, may now perhaps riÅ¿e but 10 or 12 Feet, and of this you have a certain Indication when the new Branches Å¿hoot out no where but at a conÅ¿iderable diÅ¿tance below the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the old ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48210:263"/>
On the other hand, when the <hi>Sap</hi> in the beginning of the Year had advanced the Boughs 3 or 4 Feet in height, and yet towards the latter end of the Summer they begin to grow blackiÅ¿h, and at laÅ¿t to wither and die within 5 or 6 Inches of the Top; and this even when the <hi>Root</hi> Å¿eemed in the Spring to have Å¿ufficiently done its part, and the <hi>Soil</hi> to have been duly qualified with Å¿uch a juÅ¿t proportion of Heat and MoiÅ¿ture as was requiÅ¿ite for their Vegetation: When this, I Å¿ay, happens, it muÅ¿t be aÅ¿cribed to no other CauÅ¿e than the drying up of their MoiÅ¿ture by the exceÅ¿Å¿ive Heat of the Summer, in regard that their <hi>Roots</hi> being but Å¿mall and weak, could not Å¿o well reÅ¿iÅ¿t the Violence of it, as thoÅ¿e which were more vigorous and Å¿ubÅ¿tantial. What means are proper to be uÅ¿ed for the preventing of Å¿uch Accidents, I have already mentioned elÅ¿ewhere.</p>
                     <p>Now Å¿ince the more vigorous the <hi>Root</hi> is, the more vigorouÅ¿ly alÅ¿o it will act, and conÅ¿equently Å¿uck in more NouriÅ¿hment, and cauÅ¿e that NouriÅ¿hment to riÅ¿e Å¿o much higher, it muÅ¿t undoubtedly follow, that the riÅ¿ing of the <hi>Sap</hi> to the Top of the Branches, whereby there is an AcceÅ¿Å¿ion made to their former length, proceeds only from this vigour and Å¿trength of the <hi>Root;</hi> as on the other Å¿ide, the weakneÅ¿s of the <hi>Root</hi> is the true cauÅ¿e that the <hi>Sap,</hi> not being in a Å¿ufficient quantity to riÅ¿e to a conÅ¿iderable height, is confined much lower than its uÅ¿ual pitch.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it Å¿eems probable, that as all Animals are limited to Å¿uch a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Size and Proportion, and, as a Fountain, containing Å¿uch a quantity of Water, and conveyed by a Pipe of Å¿uch a Capacity, cannot raiÅ¿e it up to a greater height than the Level of that Source from whence it flows.</p>
                     <p>In the very Å¿ame manner the DimenÅ¿ions of all Vegetables Å¿eem to be confined to a certain Å¿tint both of height and circumference, Å¿o as to have a fixed Point to which the <hi>Sap</hi> may aÅ¿cend in order to the putting forth new Branches, but cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly riÅ¿e higher to cauÅ¿e any further Production. Thus if we Lop a <hi>Tree</hi> 5 or 6 Feet, whoÅ¿e uÅ¿ual height does not exceed 10 or 12, it will always appear vigorous and lively, till it have recovered its uÅ¿ual height of 12 Feet; and the ReaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e it will be continually labouring to exert it Å¿elf to the utmoÅ¿t Sphere of its Activity, and conÅ¿equently there is no danger of its falling to Decay, or dying at the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of its Branches.</p>
                     <p>It muÅ¿t therefore be the <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to render himÅ¿elf expert in his ProfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, by a diligent ObÅ¿ervation of what is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be done, both in the Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>Trees,</hi> and the Manuring of the <hi>Ground;</hi> and indeed, the difference that is between a Fertile and Barren Soil, will aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him very much in the making a true EÅ¿timate of the Force and Vigour of the <hi>Sap.</hi> For in a Soil that is really good, a <hi>Tree</hi> will grow 30 or 35 Feet high, with a Circumference proportionable; but if the Soil be lank or barren, a <hi>Tree,</hi> though of the Å¿ame Species, and as well Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd as the other, will not, perhaps, exceed 10 or 12 Feet. The former kind of Soil will prove fruitful in a manner without any Cultivation, but the latter will be good for nothing, if its Sterility be not Å¿upplied by the utmoÅ¿t Care and AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the <hi>Gardiner.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving thus given my Opinion, how the <hi>Sap,</hi> after its entrance into the <hi>Roots,</hi> does afterwards riÅ¿e up, and communicate it Å¿elf to the upper Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> I Å¿hall now proceed to Explain in what manner the new <hi>Branches</hi> grow out of the Extremities of thoÅ¿e of the precedent Year, and how it comes to paÅ¿s that their Shooting out is generally Å¿o ordered by Nature, that the higher <hi>Branches</hi> have moÅ¿t commonly Å¿ome Advantage both in their length and thickneÅ¿s over the lower.</p>
                     <p>And here I Å¿hall reÅ¿ume my former CompariÅ¿on of a Brook, which having its CourÅ¿e retarded for Å¿ome time by a <hi>Digue</hi> or <hi>Dam,</hi> is hindred from continuing its ProgreÅ¿s to its deÅ¿igned Journey's end. This Water then, which we will Å¿uppoÅ¿e amaÅ¿s'd together in a conÅ¿iderable quantity, as we Å¿ee in larger Ponds, coming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to find divers Vents of equal Capacity, as well in the Body of the Dam which principally Å¿uÅ¿tained its PreÅ¿Å¿ure, as in the Walls built on each Å¿ide of it, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it within Å¿uch a compaÅ¿s: This Water, I Å¿ay, having either found or made theÅ¿e Breaches, will iÅ¿Å¿ue out at the Å¿ame inÅ¿tant through all of them; but for the moÅ¿t part will run out in a much greater Stream, and with a Å¿tronger Current, at
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48210:263"/>
the breach of the Dam it Å¿elf, than at the Crannies of the Å¿ides, and Å¿till faÅ¿ter in proportion, through thoÅ¿e breaches which have an aperture neareÅ¿t reÅ¿embling that of the Dam, than through thoÅ¿e which are more unlike. This Å¿o remarkable a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is caus'd by the PreÅ¿Å¿ure of the Water, haÅ¿tning continually towards its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which preÅ¿Å¿ure Å¿till encreaÅ¿es the nearer it approaches to that Centre, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the meaneÅ¿t UnderÅ¿tanding.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sap</hi> produces almoÅ¿t the Å¿ame effect in the Branches of Trees; for having found in them Å¿everal Apertures of an equal bigneÅ¿s, which we call Eyes, it makes its way at the Å¿ame time through thoÅ¿e in the upper parts, but principally, and in greater abundance, through the laÅ¿t Eye, (That I mean, which is in the very Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Branch) and where the <hi>Sap</hi> makes its Å¿trongeÅ¿t Effort, than it does through the others which are at Å¿ome diÅ¿tance. 'Tis true if there be Å¿uch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberance of <hi>Sap,</hi> that the parts of it which aÅ¿cended firÅ¿t are preÅ¿s'd forwards by the Å¿ucceeding ones, it will then diÅ¿charge it Å¿elf into the lower Eyes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more plentifully into thoÅ¿e which are neareÅ¿t to the top of the Branch, than into thoÅ¿e which are at a greater diÅ¿tance from it.</p>
                     <p>And as it falls out Å¿ometimes that a Stream encloÅ¿ed by a Dam in the Front, and by Walls on each Å¿ide, by Å¿triving to force its way out, happens to make a greater Eruption through one of its Å¿ides than through the Dam it Å¿elf, Å¿o that the Water guÅ¿hes out in great abundance, where in all probability one Å¿hould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it in a leÅ¿Å¿er quantity. JuÅ¿t Å¿o we frequently Experience it in Trees, that the New Sprouts which Å¿hoot out at the Extremities of a Pruned Branch, inÅ¿tead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bigger do oftentimes prove much leÅ¿s than any of thoÅ¿e which at the Å¿ame time grew out of it in other places.</p>
                     <p>Now, that I may give the beÅ¿t ReaÅ¿on I can of this Effect, which is Å¿o contrary to the Natural CourÅ¿e of the <hi>Sap;</hi> I conceive that this Alteration may proceed from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Sap</hi> endeavouring by its Natural Activity to make its Principal PaÅ¿Å¿age through the Extremities of the Pruned Branch, is diverted by Å¿ome Internal CauÅ¿e which the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> cannot always diÅ¿cover; and being prevented by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tacle from riÅ¿ing up in a full Stream to that Extremity, Å¿ome part of it only can get through, but the more Spirituous and Active Particles of that Stream having inÅ¿inuated themÅ¿elves into Å¿ome one of thoÅ¿e Eyes which were next below the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t, begin there to exert their utmoÅ¿t Vigour, and communicate their Virtue to the remoter Eyes in greater or leÅ¿Å¿er quantity, according as they are more or leÅ¿s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant from that part of the Branch which Å¿erv'd as a Canal to Convey that Torrent of <hi>Sap</hi> to the Extremities of the Branches.</p>
                     <p>That little Portion of <hi>Sap</hi> which paÅ¿Å¿ed to the uppermoÅ¿t Eye or Eyes, having there produced Branches of but an indifferent bigneÅ¿s, communicates to them what it uÅ¿es to do to all the weak Branches; namely a great DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition to a quick Production of Fruit Buds. And upon this Account I take a particular Care in the Pruning my Trees, of this Branch, as of the greateÅ¿t value and importance to be PreÅ¿erved for the raiÅ¿ing of Fruit.</p>
                     <p>I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s it is a difficulty which neither my long Study, nor diligent ObÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation have been able to Solve, how this <hi>Sap</hi> in proportion to its greater or leÅ¿Å¿er Quantity Å¿hould produce Å¿uch different Effects. That it does Å¿o is very evident, and thence it was that I laid down this Paradox, That the Fruit is a Symptom of the Branches weakneÅ¿s; but the manner how, or the reaÅ¿on why this comes to be Å¿o, I have not yet been able to comprehend.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I find it leÅ¿s Difficult to give an Account how Soil comes to decay and grow Barren, by bearing thoÅ¿e Plants which are not of its Native Growth, Å¿uch as Corn, Trees, PulÅ¿e, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but will not become lank or exhauÅ¿ted by a plentiful Production of ThiÅ¿tles, Nettles, and many other Weeds.</p>
                     <p>After all theÅ¿e ObÅ¿ervations, I think I may Å¿afely aver, that in all that Infinite variety of Speculations that Å¿erve for the Entertainment of our Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, there is not perhaps any Subject more Nice and Intricate to adjuÅ¿t rightly than that of <hi>Vegetation.</hi> 'Tis, I confeÅ¿s, a Field of very large Extent, and open to all the World, where every one has free liberty to enter and make what reÅ¿earches he pleaÅ¿es, though very few have had the good Fortune to Å¿ucceed in the attempt. So many are the particular differences that perplex it, that nothing is Å¿o eaÅ¿ie or Å¿o common as to fall into great miÅ¿takes about it, when we pretend from our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervations upon one Plant, to make Inferences concerning another; and from thence proceed to lay down Å¿everal ConcluÅ¿ions and General Maxims.</p>

Yet as to their outward Appearance, they may not unfitly be compared to Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little Republicks, each of them differing from the other in their Government, and having nothing in their manner of Acting common with their Neighbours, but the Polity of the one being pretty often quite contrary to that of the other. Thus we Å¿ee, for inÅ¿tance, that Birds, though they all agree in the way of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their Species, <hi>viz.</hi> by Eggs, do notwithÅ¿tanding differ in their bigneÅ¿s and colour, in their Note, their way of Living, Acting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Nature has ImpreÅ¿s'd Å¿o great a diverÅ¿ity in all <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as if Å¿he had deÅ¿ign'd as well to make us admire that InexhauÅ¿ted Stock of Variety in her Productions, as to confound and dazle the UnderÅ¿tanding of Mankind, when it preÅ¿umes to Dive into the MyÅ¿teries of her WorkmanÅ¿hip, and pretends to give ReaÅ¿ons for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truÅ¿eÅ¿t of her Operations.</p>
                     <p>There have been in all Ages Å¿ome very Ingenious PerÅ¿ons, who have made it their buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to become knowing in this Faculty; and even at this preÅ¿ent time we Å¿ee many that Study it with extraordinary Application. But the Misfortune is, that if we happen to make any, though but an inconÅ¿iderable DiÅ¿covery, into the Nature of Å¿ome one <hi>Vegetable,</hi> beyond the Medicinal Properties of it, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently too apt to flatter our Å¿elves with a belief, that we have attain'd to a perfect UnderÅ¿tanding of it both in the CauÅ¿e, and Manner, of its Being, and from thence make no Å¿cruple to infer ConcluÅ¿ions concerning others alÅ¿o; whereas if we look into the Matter but a little further, there will immediately occur to us Å¿o many Plants of a quite contrary Nature, as are more than enough to confound our Judgments, and deÅ¿troy our HypotheÅ¿is, or at leaÅ¿t to give a fatal blow to the greateÅ¿t part of what we pretend to lay down as UniverÅ¿al Maxims.</p>

Which RipeneÅ¿s as it is, with relation to Mans UÅ¿e, the higheÅ¿t degree of its Perfection, Å¿o in reÅ¿pect to the duration of the Fruit or Flower, it is the neareÅ¿t Å¿tep to its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction. This ConÅ¿ideration, I Å¿ay, is enough to encline one, to lay down this as a General Rule, That in all Plants, the nearer any Part is to that Place from whence it receives its NouriÅ¿hment, Å¿o much Å¿ooner doth that Part arrive to its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and Perfection.</p>
                     <p>But how ill grounded this AÅ¿Å¿ertion would be, is Å¿ufficiently DemonÅ¿trated by what we continually Å¿ee in <hi>Figs, Melons, Peaches, Plums, Abricots,</hi> &amp;c. namely that the beÅ¿t part, and which Ripens Å¿ooneÅ¿t, is furtheÅ¿t from the Stalk, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently that which is at the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿tance both from the Bole and Roots.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Orange-Trees, JeÅ¿Å¿imines, Pinks, Musk RoÅ¿es,</hi> &amp;c. the Buds that Flower firÅ¿t, are thoÅ¿e Growing at the Extremities of the Branches; and indeed, there needs no more to the putting our NaturaliÅ¿t to an AbÅ¿olute <hi>Non plus,</hi> than only to bid him conÅ¿ider the Nature of the <hi>Rasberry</hi> and <hi>RoÅ¿e-Laurel Trees,</hi> neither of which keep any conÅ¿tant order either in the Ripening of their Fruit or Blowing of their Bud; for Å¿ometimes that which is furtheÅ¿t off Ripens or Blows firÅ¿t, and Å¿ometimes that which is neareÅ¿t. This unequal, or rather diÅ¿orderly way of acting, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extream difficulty be fix'd or Å¿tated by any General Maxims.</p>
                     <p>Thus then we Å¿ee, that inÅ¿tead of laying down one General AphoriÅ¿m concerning the order of Nature in the Ripening of Fruit, and Blowing of Flower Buds, we muÅ¿t deliver as many different Maxims as there are different Specie; of Fruits and Flowers upon the whole Face of the UniverÅ¿e.</p>

Again, if in the Spring we Examine what <hi>Branch</hi> it is out of which moÅ¿t Fruit. Grows, as <hi>Pears, Apples, Peaches, Plums, Abricots, Cherries, Goosberries,</hi> &amp;c. it will appear to be upon the Boughs of at leaÅ¿t one or two years former Growth, for here it was that the <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> did upon the fall of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the preceding Summer receive their firÅ¿t Formation.</p>
                     <p>Now having gain'd this Point of Knowledge, we are tempted to infer from thence that all BloÅ¿Å¿oms have their Being a long time before the Fruit, but then on the other Å¿ide, let us but look upon the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Wallnut-Tree,</hi> the Great <hi>CheÅ¿nut,</hi> the <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Rasberry-BuÅ¿h,</hi> &amp;c. and we Å¿hall Å¿ee that in theÅ¿e Nature has Acted in a quite different manner than Å¿he uÅ¿ually doth in other <hi>Trees:</hi> For in thoÅ¿e I have now mentioned, the BloÅ¿Å¿oms precede the Fruit but a very few days, Å¿ince both the BloÅ¿Å¿oms and the Fruit Grow only upon Å¿uch Branches as were put forth themÅ¿elves but that very Spring, and are almoÅ¿t Contemporaries in their Birth with the Bough it Å¿elf that is to Å¿upport them. However there is this difference between them, That <hi>Å¿ome</hi> Fruits are form'd at the very <hi>extremity</hi> of the Bough, as <hi>Wallnuts, CheÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Quinces,</hi> and theÅ¿e for the moÅ¿t part do entirely put a Å¿top to the Branches Growing any further, except only that on the <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>CheÅ¿nut-Trees,</hi> we Å¿ee Å¿ometimes that after the <hi>Nuts</hi> have received their formation at the top of the Bough, there will yet riÅ¿e <hi>Sap</hi> enough to make it grow conÅ¿iderably longer. Other Fruits there are which are produced on the lower part of the Branch, and theÅ¿e never hinder the ExtenÅ¿ion or Lengthning of it, as the <hi>Grape,</hi> the <hi>Mulberry,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we Å¿ee what a mighty difference there is in the manner of the Production of Å¿everal Fruits.</p>
                     <p>If we look, in the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> upon that part of the Branch which is firÅ¿t Å¿tripp'd of its Leaves, it will preÅ¿ently appear that in moÅ¿t Trees it is the Top that firÅ¿t Å¿hews it Å¿elf bare, as if the <hi>Roots</hi> not being then Å¿o vigorous in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Heat of the <hi>Air</hi> not Å¿trong enough to Å¿upply their NeceÅ¿Å¿ities, the <hi>Sap</hi> thereupon became incapable of riÅ¿ing to its uÅ¿ual heighth; but now on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>PeaÅ¿e, Beans, Artichokes, Cabbage,</hi> and moÅ¿t Å¿orts of <hi>PulÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>Legumes;</hi> as alÅ¿o in <hi>Almond</hi> and <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> that are very vigorous and thriving; we find the lower part is firÅ¿t dried and decayed, whilÅ¿t at the Å¿ame time the Top continues its Verdure, and Shooting forth. Can any thing be more irreconcileable than theÅ¿e two effects of <hi>Sap</hi> Å¿o contrary one to another?</p>
                     <p>In all Trees whether of Stone or Kernel Fruit, Ocular Experience tells us that the Fruit grows always juÅ¿t in the Å¿ame place where its BloÅ¿Å¿om grew, as if the BloÅ¿Å¿om in its <hi>Exit</hi> or falling off Å¿eem'd only to give way to the coming of the Fruit, for whoÅ¿e Å¿ake it was blown; but now in <hi>Wallnut-Trees, CheÅ¿nuts</hi> and <hi>HaÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As to the order or proceÅ¿s of Nature in the Production of Fruits, the firÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it is made by the <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> and as we have Å¿aid already concerning <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-Trees,</hi> every Bud contains in it Å¿everal BloÅ¿Å¿oms, and conÅ¿equently Å¿everal Fruits alÅ¿o; as in <hi>Stone Fruit-Trees</hi> every Bud contains but one BloÅ¿Å¿om, and therefore but one Å¿ingle Fruit. In the midÅ¿t of every one of theÅ¿e BloÅ¿Å¿oms, there is a little Sting or Active Particle, from which within three or four days after Blowing the Fruit is form'd if the Weather prove favourable; that is, if the Rigor of the Cold do not deÅ¿troy theÅ¿e precious Embryo's or Beginnings; Å¿o that ordinarily every Species of Fruit is UÅ¿her'd in by its BloÅ¿Å¿om. But here we muÅ¿t except the <hi>Fig,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced entirely, and all at once, without any BloÅ¿Å¿om; and in <hi>Melons, Cucumbers, Gourds,</hi> &amp;c. the Fruit it Å¿elf appears before the BloÅ¿Å¿om, for it is not till Å¿ome days after the Production of the <hi>Melon,</hi> that the BloÅ¿Å¿om which grows out of the Top of it receives its compleat Formation, and afterwards proceeds to Blowing. 'Tis upon the thriving of this BloÅ¿Å¿om that the Perfection of the Fruit depends; Å¿o that if that prove unable to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the Cold, and all its other Enemies, the Fruit will dye almoÅ¿t as Å¿oon as it is Born.</p>
                     <p>It is further obÅ¿ervable, that though for the moÅ¿t part there remaineth nothing of the BloÅ¿Å¿om with the Fruit, Å¿o that this is not wont to appear before the BloÅ¿Å¿om is entirely gone, yet notwithÅ¿tanding we find that in the <hi>Pomegranate</hi> there is left Å¿ome part of the BloÅ¿Å¿om which goes to the ConÅ¿truction or CompoÅ¿ition of it; unleÅ¿s you will Å¿ay rather that part of the Fruit grows at the Å¿ame time with the BloÅ¿Å¿om

and is to it, if I may uÅ¿e the CompariÅ¿on, like a Cradle or Shell, and this as well for the preÅ¿ervation of it, as to Å¿erve for a cover both to that Å¿ort of congealed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and to the Grains or Kernels which are the very EÅ¿Å¿ence and SubÅ¿tance of this Fruit.</p>
                     <p>In an Acorn the firÅ¿t thing that appears is a kind of Shell or Husk, of a Figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween round and flat, that Å¿hews it Å¿elf about the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> and which we may Å¿ay Å¿erves in Å¿tead of a BloÅ¿Å¿om to it, Å¿ince indeed it has no other: and out of the middle of this Husk the Acorn it Å¿elf grows, which Tradition tells us was the principal Food of Mankind in the Primitive Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p>Now as every Tree is compoÅ¿ed of Å¿everal Branches, Å¿ome Å¿trong and others weak, if we examine the place whereon ordinarily the Fruit grows, we find that Nature has induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly choÅ¿en to fructifie upon the weaker, and not upon the Å¿tronger Branches.</p>
                     <p>But now in Vines and Fig-Trees it is juÅ¿t the contrary, for it is generally Å¿een that Grapes and Figs very rarely grow upon the weak Branches, but are in great plenty upon thoÅ¿e that be thicker, Å¿tronger and more vigorous. How then is it poÅ¿Å¿ible to reduce to one Maxim this inconÅ¿iÅ¿tency of Nature in chuÅ¿ing Å¿uch different Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Production of Fruit?</p>
                     <p>If we conÅ¿ider after what manner Trees are extended in length both in their Trunk and Branches, we find this remarkable CircumÅ¿tance, namely, that in the Spring and Summer whilÅ¿t the Sap acts moÅ¿t briskly, that which was the Top or Extremity of a Bough this moment, ceaÅ¿es to be Å¿o the next; by reaÅ¿on that the Sap aÅ¿cending continually without intermiÅ¿Å¿ion, Å¿till puts out new Leaves above the precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; and the new Å¿hoot receives the Å¿ame Treatment from the Å¿ucceeding Sap, that it gave to that extremity of the Branch which immediately preceded it.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary in Artichokes, AÅ¿paragus, Grapes, in all Leafs, and Fruits, in Tulips Pinks, and moÅ¿t Å¿orts of Flowers, we Å¿ee that what was once the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme part, always continues Å¿o, Å¿o that their Augmentation or Growth is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and not form'd outwardly, as Experience Å¿hews us it is in Trees. The AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus, Artichoke, Tulip and moÅ¿t Å¿orts of Flowers appear plainly to grow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, though but in Å¿mall Threads or Filaments, out of the very Å¿ubÅ¿tance or heart of the Plant, and afterwards encreaÅ¿e in thickneÅ¿s in the inÅ¿ide of it by the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance or Å¿upply of the Adventitious NouriÅ¿hment. So that if we conÅ¿ider by what Å¿mall and almoÅ¿t imperceptible degrees they riÅ¿e up from their Stalk, and are puÅ¿h'd up by the new Sap, it Å¿eems to have Å¿ome reÅ¿emblance in the manner of its growth with a Syringe, where the Sucker is thruÅ¿t through the exteriour Tube till it come out through the Top of it.</p>
                     <p>Again, If we conÅ¿ider what it is that cauÅ¿es the whiteneÅ¿s and delicacy of tyed Lettuce, Celeri, the SpaniÅ¿h or White ThiÅ¿tle, the Leek, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will appear to be either from their having been cover'd with dry Dung, dry Leaves, Earth or Mould, whereby they are hindred from receiving the uÅ¿ual freÅ¿hneÅ¿s and virtue of the open Air.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes to paÅ¿s, that the parts thus covered being no longer penetrated by the Sun-beams, do not only loÅ¿e, together with their beautiful Green colour, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had of toughneÅ¿s, or of a bitter unpleaÅ¿ant taÅ¿te; but alÅ¿o acquire a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whiteneÅ¿s, accompanied with that agreeable and delicate ReliÅ¿h for which they are Å¿o much eÅ¿teem'd. But in AÅ¿paragus the caÅ¿e is quite otherwiÅ¿e, for in that we find thoÅ¿e parts the tougheÅ¿t and moÅ¿t ungrateful to the Palate which by their being deprived of the Suns immediate preÅ¿ence, by the Mould or Dung that covered them, were become perfectly white: Whereas on the contrary the beÅ¿t and Å¿weeteÅ¿t parts are thoÅ¿e which are Green and ReddiÅ¿h. This in my Opinion is an inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable difficulty, that the being expoÅ¿ed to the Air Å¿hould make Å¿ome Plants tender, and others tough and hard at the Å¿ame inÅ¿tant.</p>
                     <p>Dazies and Gilliflowers are for Å¿ome time white, but a little after, the Sun by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees changes them from White, into the moÅ¿t beautiful Red in the World.</p>
                     <p>In Pinks and Tulips, that Vivid Red which adorns them in their firÅ¿t blowing, forÅ¿akes them after the Sun has Å¿hin'd upon them for Å¿ome time.</p>
                     <p>MoÅ¿t Å¿orts of Pears are coloured in the BloÅ¿Å¿om, and afterwards become Green, Grey, White or Yellow, and Å¿ome of them towards the latter end, when they are near ripening, reÅ¿ume a more lively Red than ever they had before.</p>
                     <p>Apricocks, as they advance nearer to Maturity, change from Green to White, and from thence turn to an admirable Vermillion.</p>

The Suns Influence makes early Peaches white, Mulberries black, Cherries, Straw-berries, Rasberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of an Orient redneÅ¿s, moÅ¿t kinds of Peaches of a Purple colour: In Å¿hort, it gives an incredible variety of Tinctures, both to Plums and other Fruits, as well as to all Å¿orts of Flowers. You Å¿ee here how many InÅ¿tances I have given of very material Differences.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Leaves of Plants and Trees, we commonly find but one upon a Stalk, and they grow upon the Boughs ChequerwiÅ¿e, in little Stories or Steps at a Å¿mall diÅ¿tance from each other. But nevertheleÅ¿s in Å¿ome Trees we find growing upon one Stalk, three, five, or Å¿even Leaves: as in the Elder, Walnut, and RoÅ¿e-Lawrel-Tree; upon others Å¿even, nine, or eleven, as in the AÅ¿h-Tree: Nay, upon others to the number of Å¿eventeen, nineteen, and twenty one, as in the Acacia; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with an odd Number. And it is obÅ¿ervable, that when Å¿o many Leaves are found upon one Stalk, they never grow in Stories or Chequer'd, as I juÅ¿t now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, but are diametrically oppoÅ¿ite one to another.</p>
                     <p>In Mulberry-Trees we Å¿ee that in <hi>May,</hi> out of every Eye or Bud that was upon the Branches of the precedent Year, there grow ordinarily four or five Mulberries: Nay, Å¿ometimes there appears a new Shoot, which is either longer or Å¿horter in proportion to the quantity of Sap that was convey'd to the Bud from whence it Å¿prung.</p>
                     <p>In Fig-Trees, out of the Navel or midÅ¿t of every Leaf coming between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring and the middle of <hi>June,</hi> (which is about the time of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <hi>SolÅ¿tice,</hi> and conÅ¿equently of the greateÅ¿t Exuberance of the Sap) there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantly grows a Fig at <hi>Autumn,</hi> of that kind we call Å¿econd Figs: But the number of them in our Climate does not exceed five or Å¿ix, or Å¿even at moÅ¿t, and that upon every good Branch only.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿ay upon every good Branch only, becauÅ¿e all Branches have not the advantage of being Å¿o: For inÅ¿tance, Å¿uch as are weak, and thoÅ¿e great Suckers that riÅ¿e out of the foot of the Tree, with all that Å¿prout from the extremity of the pruned Stock: And laÅ¿tly, even thoÅ¿e great Boughs, or falÅ¿e Shoots rather, that grow out of the Trunk of the Tree, muÅ¿t not come under that Denomination. So that indeed none are to be eÅ¿teem'd good Branches but Å¿uch as at their firÅ¿t Å¿hooting are of a due bigneÅ¿s, and following the Natural Order of Production in all Branches; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we have already diÅ¿courÅ¿ed in another place.</p>
                     <p>ThoÅ¿e Figs which are uÅ¿ually called Figs of the firÅ¿t Sap, begin to appear about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and grow on a Å¿uddain to an indifferent bigneÅ¿s before the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth yet of any Leaves: The Seat where they grow is that very point or place where thoÅ¿e Leaves were put forth the Summer before that had not produc'd any of thoÅ¿e above-mention'd Å¿econd Figs, which uÅ¿e to be ripe at <hi>Autumn.</hi> TheÅ¿e Figs of the firÅ¿t Sap Å¿eldom fail of being ripe at the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> or in <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> if the cold do not happen to pinch them, and make them fall: Or if during the Summer they eÅ¿cape being Å¿poiled by violent Rains or exceÅ¿s of Heat: As for the Figs of the Å¿econd Sap, there is no hope of their coming to perfection, except in thoÅ¿e which being put forth by Mid-<hi>June,</hi> were come almoÅ¿t to their full bigneÅ¿s before the end of <hi>July;</hi> and even then it muÅ¿t be in a hot and dry Soil, and when it proves a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <hi>Autumn,</hi> and free from FroÅ¿ts, and cold Rains, as it was in the Years 1670, and 1676.</p>
                     <p>Neither are Figs the only Fruits that are formed out of the Navel or Middle of their Leaf, Å¿ince it is no more than what is common to them with many others, particularly to the Acorn and JaÅ¿min. Grapes indeed grow in a quite contrary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hion, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the ReverÅ¿e or Back-Å¿ide of the Leaf: which is very Å¿trange and Å¿ingular. Nor is it leÅ¿s remarkable, that in moÅ¿t Vines they grow commonly but at the third, fourth, or fifth Knot, which is at the lower part of the Branch; whereas all other Fruits are born throughout the whole length of that Branch, which we call the Fruit-Branch, and in greater plenty toward the Top than Bottom of it.</p>
                     <p>Quinces bear almoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame manner with Rasberries, Azeroliers, and Pome-granates, <hi>viz.</hi> at the end of the Å¿mall Branches Å¿prouting from the Great Ones in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April:</hi> But if a Pear-Tree be graffed upon a Quince, it beareth only upon thoÅ¿e Branches that are of a Year or two's growth.</p>
                     <p>In all Plants the greateÅ¿t part of the Sap, as I have often Å¿aid, commonly riÅ¿es up between the Bark and the Tree; and perhaps Å¿ome of it may aÅ¿cend through the Wood it Å¿elf: But in the Vine, which to Å¿peak properly has no Bark, the Sap evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently riÅ¿es through the SubÅ¿tance or Body of the Tree.</p>

The increaÅ¿ing of the Fruit in bigneÅ¿s, is cauÅ¿ed by its NouriÅ¿hment or <hi>Sap,</hi> which being convey'd from the Branch by the Stalk, as through a Pipe, into the Fruit between the Skin or Paring, and the Pulp, is there reduced to a thicker, and more Å¿olid ConÅ¿iÅ¿tence conformably to its reÅ¿pective Nature. And probably both the Wood of the Tree, and Stalk of the Fruit receive their IncreaÅ¿e in Bulk much after the Å¿ame manner.</p>
                     <p>Nature has obÅ¿erved this Order in her Productions, that generally the faireÅ¿t Fruit grows upon the Top of the Bough, that the weakeÅ¿t Boughs are moÅ¿t fruitful in bearing, and that they bear but once a year. In <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Å¿he doth not keep to this Rule: For <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> The <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> bears Fruit twice a year. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It bears only upon the bigger Branches, Å¿o that (in <hi>Autumn</hi> particularly) thoÅ¿e <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> bears only, that are old enough to be of a Å¿ufficient Strength and Vigor. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The earlieÅ¿t and largeÅ¿t Figs grow fartheÅ¿t from the Top, the others in proportion to their greater or leÅ¿Å¿er DiÅ¿tance from it, advance more or leÅ¿s in their ForwardneÅ¿s and BigneÅ¿s, and commonly they follow the Å¿ame Order of SucceÅ¿Å¿ion in their Ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they did at their firÅ¿t growing.</p>
                     <p>The manner of the <hi>Indian Fig-Tree</hi>'s bearing its Fruit without the Support of any Trunk or Branches, and making uÅ¿e of its Leaves only to multiply and grow upon, is, in my Opinion, as Å¿urpriÅ¿ing a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> as any of thoÅ¿e Objects which daily attract our Admiration.</p>
                     <p>Ordinarily moÅ¿t of our Plants are Å¿ome time in the BloÅ¿Å¿om before they run up to Seed. But <hi>PurÅ¿lain</hi> runs to Seed almoÅ¿t without any BloÅ¿Å¿om at all: For as Å¿oon as the Stem is grown to a Å¿ufficient BigneÅ¿s, it begins to riÅ¿e up in Å¿everal Stalks, all of them Å¿eparated from each other, and produces a Seed, which at firÅ¿t is white and tender. This Seed, which is contained in little Pods, as it ripens, becomes black and hard, and then the Pods opening themÅ¿elves, diÅ¿cover the little TreaÅ¿ure includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, which before they had Å¿o carefully conceal'd.</p>
                     <p>The Difference of Colours in Fruit BloÅ¿Å¿oms, is very remarkable. <hi>Pears, Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> have a White BloÅ¿Å¿om: <hi>Apple-Trees</hi> a Red, <hi>Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> an Orange-colour, and <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> a light Purple; and of theÅ¿e BloÅ¿Å¿oms, Å¿ome are double, Å¿ome Å¿ingle; Å¿ome great, Å¿ome middle-Å¿iz'd, and others very Å¿mall. That indented, or jagged Figure wherewith Nature has wantonly adorned moÅ¿t Å¿orts of Vigetables, and which by its different Cut or Edging, in every Species, gave Mankind the firÅ¿t Hint that hath Å¿ince furniÅ¿h'd him with Å¿o many Varieties: This Artificial, and Curious Edging, may very well deÅ¿erve Å¿ome Place in our PhiloÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Meditations.</p>
                     <p>If we conÅ¿ider the CircumÅ¿tances attending the Bulbs of <hi>Tulips,</hi> we cannot but acknowledge that PhiloÅ¿ophy has not yet been able to give us a Å¿atisfactory Account of them. They are put into the Ground in <hi>October,</hi> and there take Root, and in <hi>March</hi> following, each of them puts out a Stalk, in order to Budding, and BloÅ¿Å¿om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in due time. Hitherto you will Å¿ay, there is nothing extraordinary, Å¿ince the Å¿ame thing is always Å¿een in the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> the <hi>Hyacinth, TuberoÅ¿e, Jonquil,</hi> &amp;c. but here then lyes the Wonder, that this <hi>Tulip-Stalh,</hi> which grew manifeÅ¿tly out of the very Middle, or Center of the Bulb, juÅ¿t as the Stalk uÅ¿ually grows out of the Middle in all other Bulbs, is at length remov'd from its firÅ¿t Seat, <hi>viz.</hi> the Center, to the OutÅ¿ide, or Superficies of its Bulb; a peculiar CaÅ¿e which happens not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plant. Now who is it that can Å¿olve the Difficulty how this TranÅ¿poÅ¿ition is brought to paÅ¿s? Does the Bulb force it back again? Or does it by a Å¿ort of <hi>Leger de main</hi> in its AÅ¿cent, penetrate the Å¿ides of the Bulb? This indeed is a MyÅ¿tery in Vigetation that can never be look'd upon with Å¿ufficient AÅ¿toniÅ¿hment and Admiration.</p>
                     <p>It would be an endleÅ¿s Labour, Å¿hould I particularize all my ObÅ¿ervations of this kind in Vegetables: But theÅ¿e are Å¿ufficient to demonÅ¿trate, that every Plant has a peculiar, determinate, certain, and infallible Stint or Term, for the Beginning and Duration of its Action, for the Manner of its Appearance above Ground, for the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its Soil, for the TaÅ¿te, Colour, and Å¿ize of its Fruit, for the Figure, BigneÅ¿s, and Colour of the Seed, the Difference of its Leaves and Stalk, or for the Parts of the Tree where the Fruit and the Seed grows. And though, as I have Å¿aid divers times, it be very difficult to explain all theÅ¿e peculiar Differences by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pores, the different Configuration of Parts, or Atoms of a Figure, juÅ¿tly proportioned for the Penetration of them.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿hall here, notwithÅ¿tanding, conclude this Subject at preÅ¿ent, after I have given the Reader my Thoughts concerning that Circulation of the Sap, which Å¿ome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have diÅ¿covered in Plants.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Reflections upon their Opinion that maintains the Circulation of the <hi>Sap.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS I am of Opinion, <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That there is in the <hi>Spring,</hi> a certain Rarefaction in all Vegetables, which is the firÅ¿t Mover in Vegetation. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is in every Plant a Vital Principle, which being a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Agent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the firÅ¿t Effects of that Rarefaction, as I have already diÅ¿courÅ¿ed elÅ¿ewhere. So I cannot think of any CompariÅ¿on fitter, to make my Notion intelligible, than that of a Clock, which needs no more to Å¿et it going, than only to pull up the Weight, and give a little Jog to the PendulumâThe Truth is, I always thought it abÅ¿olutely impoÅ¿Å¿ible to make this pretended Circulation conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the Action of the Roots, which we daily Å¿ee to extend themÅ¿elves both in Length and ThickneÅ¿s at the very Å¿ame InÅ¿tant that they receive their NouriÅ¿hment. And the Objections that prevail'd with me, were theÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> I cannot apprehend either at what time, or in what Place this Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Å¿hould begin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot Å¿ee either any NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, or Advantage of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> SuppoÅ¿ing we Å¿hould admit it, I am in the dark, whether we muÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ert one general Circulation only in every Tree, or whether there muÅ¿t be as many Circulations, as there are particular Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Time when it begins, if there be Å¿uch a Circulation, it muÅ¿t certainly have its Beginning the very Å¿ame InÅ¿tant that the Roots begin their Action, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o muÅ¿t owe that very Beginning to the Influence and Virtue of the Roots; Å¿o that conÅ¿equently there may be a Time when there will be no Circulation, for as much as the Roots are not continually in Action. Now, as the principal ReaÅ¿on of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this <hi>HypotheÅ¿is</hi> of Circulation in Animals is drawn from the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of it, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Purifying the Blood, which, we are told, would be in great Danger of being corrupted, if not kept in continual Motion: So if that InÅ¿tance hold in Plants, it muÅ¿t then alÅ¿o follow, that the <hi>Sap</hi> would be in the like Danger of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that very firÅ¿t Moment of its Circulations being intermitted; and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we Å¿hould Å¿ee a general Mortality of all thoÅ¿e Trees that Å¿hould happen not to be in Action; whatever the CauÅ¿e of it might be, whether their being hindred by the FroÅ¿t, or their lying out of the Ground; and much more, that all Branches, when once Å¿eparated from the Tree that bare them, muÅ¿t immediately periÅ¿h; juÅ¿t as the Members, as Å¿oon as they are cut off from the Body. But now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more contrary to the Experience of every one, than this will, as appears evidently by that infinite Number of Plants, and Grafts, which are Å¿o frequently, and with Å¿uch good SucceÅ¿s, Å¿ent into foreign Countries, without the leaÅ¿t ill Accident, provided they be not overmuch dry'd by exceÅ¿s of Heat.</p>
                     <p>But Å¿uppoÅ¿ing there be really Å¿uch a Circulation, and that it commences at the Å¿ame time with the Action of the Roots: Yet how will they be able to Å¿olve the Production of thoÅ¿e Branches which Å¿hoot forth in the Spring, without any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Roots. That it is Å¿o, there can be no doubt, Å¿ince we have InÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it every Spring in Trees newly planted, and which have not yet put forth any new Roots. As alÅ¿o in Trees digg'd up in the Winter, and left lying on the Ground: and even Branches lopp'd off in that SeaÅ¿on, and Å¿et up an end in the Ground, will put out little Shoots in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>In fine, How is it poÅ¿Å¿ible to give a clear Account of this Circulation, when we find that Almonds, Nuts, and even common Seeds, Å¿hoot out within the Earth, and in a few days put forth a Root, growing in length downward, but do not cauÅ¿e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Production to riÅ¿e up out of the Ground? When we Å¿ee that, the Bulb of the <hi>Imperial</hi> will Å¿end out Roots in <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> but no Stalk; and on the contrary, other Bulbs put out Stalks in the <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> but no Roots; when <hi>Tulips, Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roÅ¿e's,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially the <hi>AÅ¿paragus,</hi> grow upright in Å¿uch a manner, as that which was the extream Part at its firÅ¿t Appearance, Å¿till continues Å¿o, and that all of it riÅ¿es entirely and at once from the Bottom to the Top; when the Sprouts Å¿hooting out from the Extremity of a Branch, which has been cut or cropt, have Å¿uch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difference in Length and ThickneÅ¿s, as I have formerly deÅ¿cribed. It is, I think, Å¿ufficiently clear from hence, that there is a very unequal DiÅ¿tribution made of the <hi>Sap;</hi> Å¿eeing that the Fruit-buds are form'd only upon the Top of the weak Branches, and grow only at the Bottom of the Strong. I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s, it Å¿eems a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48210:267"/>
very difficult Task to me, to prove a Circulation in all theÅ¿e, and an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Examples, that I could produce upon this OccaÅ¿ion.</p>
                     <p>If we can prove therefore that there is no Circulation in Å¿ome Plants, I Å¿ee no reaÅ¿on why we may not poÅ¿itively conclude againÅ¿t the AdmiÅ¿Å¿ion of it in others.</p>
                     <p>But to give a further DemonÅ¿tration of the ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibility of this Circulation, let us but conÅ¿ider, that upon the AdmiÅ¿Å¿ion of it, we muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e in every Branch, three diÅ¿tinct, and Å¿eparate PaÅ¿Å¿ages, <hi>viz.</hi> two for the going, and returning of the imperfect <hi>Sap,</hi> and a third for the return of it when it is arriv'd at its Perfection, namely, to convey it to that Place where it is to make its ReÅ¿idence. I do not Å¿ay there muÅ¿t be PaÅ¿Å¿ages for its <hi>RiÅ¿ing</hi> and <hi>DeÅ¿cending,</hi> becauÅ¿e it happens very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the Branches hang downward, and Fruit-Branches generally grow in that PoÅ¿ture; Å¿o that to Å¿peak properly, we cannot Å¿ay that the <hi>Sap AÅ¿cends,</hi> when really it <hi>DeÅ¿cends;</hi> and for this ReaÅ¿on I choÅ¿e rather to Å¿ay barely, that the <hi>Sap</hi> will need Å¿everal <hi>Ways</hi> or <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿ages</hi> for the Conveyance of it in its going and return.</p>
                     <p>For InÅ¿tance, I deÅ¿ire to know where they will find theÅ¿e three diÅ¿tinct PaÅ¿Å¿ages in a Cherry-Stalk, or how the <hi>Sap,</hi> which in its firÅ¿t Motion, Å¿hould have riÅ¿en to the Extremity, or Top, and then return'd back immediately down to the Roots: how I Å¿ay it Å¿hould be determin'd by Nature, to deÅ¿cend to the Cherry, which hangs down, and afterwards re-aÅ¿cend to that Place, where it turn'd out of the way that lead it upward, and from thence fall into that Path which was to convey it to the Root, and at laÅ¿t re-conduct it to the Place where it is finally lodg'd, to Å¿upply the Exigencies of the Fruit and Leaves.</p>
                     <p>I would ask further, Whether or no there be not a Circulation of <hi>Sap</hi> in the Fruit, as well as in the Tree; if Å¿o, then theÅ¿e two <hi>Saps,</hi> muÅ¿t, in their Return, have each of them their particular Way (which will cauÅ¿e a great Multiplication of Ways) or elÅ¿e they muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily mix together, and then would enÅ¿ue an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky ConfuÅ¿ion of the two <hi>Saps,</hi> one of which is affirm'd, by them, to be much Purer and Nobler than the other.</p>
                     <p>According to this <hi>HypotheÅ¿is,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> muÅ¿t make a great many Journeys backward and forward, which is a thing very diÅ¿agreeable to Nature, who affects to be plain and Å¿imple in all her Operations. Why therefore may we not rather Å¿ay, that the <hi>Sap</hi> acquires its Perfection that very Moment in which it arrives at the Roots; juÅ¿t as the Air is illuminated in every part, immediately upon the Sun's beginning to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above the <hi>Horizon?</hi> But further, admitting that this Circulation were neceÅ¿Å¿ary for perfecting the <hi>Sap,</hi> I would fain be Å¿atisfy'd where it is that the <hi>Sap</hi> receives this Perfection. It cannot be at its firÅ¿t entrance into the Roots, becauÅ¿e, according to the Principles of our AntagoniÅ¿ts, it is there but in an imperfect and indigeÅ¿ted State; neither can it be when it is arrived at the Extremities of the Boughs, or Fruit, Å¿eeing it doth not continue there, but has yet two Stages to travel further; for if it take up its ReÅ¿t in thoÅ¿e Extremities, it muÅ¿t then follow, that it was come to its compleat Perfection, and conÅ¿equently would have no need of returning to its firÅ¿t SourÅ¿e. Neither can it be Å¿aid to be thus perfect at its Å¿econd coming into the Roots, becauÅ¿e then certainly it would take up its final ReÅ¿idence with them; for Å¿ince it is indifferent to the <hi>Sap,</hi> when it is once perfectly digeÅ¿ted, whether it be employed in the Formation of the Roots, Trunk, or Branches, Leaves or Fruits; it would undoubtedly fix it Å¿elf in the very firÅ¿t Place, where it Å¿hould find it Å¿elf qualified with all the Degrees of Perfection requiÅ¿ite to its Nature.</p>
                     <p>Again, SuppoÅ¿ing that the Extremity, or Top of the Branch, to which the <hi>Sap</hi> was to have riÅ¿en, were cut off, I deÅ¿ire to know in what manner this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Ways, and turning out of the one into the other, could be Å¿olved, and what would become of the <hi>Sap</hi> deÅ¿ign'd to have been made into Fruit, if it Å¿hould be Å¿topp'd in the midÅ¿t of the Way, before it could arrive at its Journey's End.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be deny'd that this Doctrine of Circulation, draws an infinite Number of Inconveniencies along with it, which, in my Judgment, can be prevented no other way, but by the following Account of the ProceÅ¿s of the <hi>Sap</hi> in Vegetation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Vital Principle, which is the <hi>FirÅ¿t Mover</hi> in the Action of the Plant, being Invigorated by the Warmth of the Sun, immediately communicates to that MoiÅ¿ture, which was attracted by the Roots, Å¿uch a Quality as is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the making of it perfect <hi>Sap,</hi> which nevertheleÅ¿s is not determined in its own Nature, to any particular. Production, but may indifferently become either Fruit, Leaves, or Trunk; and as that <hi>Sap</hi> has all the Degrees of Rarefaction that are requiÅ¿ite for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48210:267"/>
it, it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be a light and Å¿ubtil Body, and conÅ¿equently extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to riÅ¿e up to all the Extremities of the Branches. Where it is very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it exerts it Å¿elf, in producing a great Number of Boughs, and Leaves, all of them bearing a Size proportionable to the abundance of the aÅ¿cending <hi>Sap:</hi> If it aÅ¿cend but in a very Å¿mall Quantity, it is employ'd in bearing an infinite Number of BloÅ¿Å¿oms, and good Å¿tore of Fruit, though it will be but Å¿mall in its DimenÅ¿ions. And laÅ¿tly, where the <hi>Sap</hi> riÅ¿es in a moderate Proportion in Å¿ome certain Places, as either upon the Top of the weak Branches, or the lower part of the Strong, it there Å¿ignalizes it Å¿elf in the Productions of Buds, and of large and beautiful Fruit.</p>
                     <p>But now to give a clear and rational Account of this admirable DiÅ¿tribution of the <hi>Sap</hi> unto every part of the Tree, either for the Beginning, Continuing, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating, and Determining it in its juÅ¿t BigneÅ¿s and Proportion, is a Work above Humane Performance. Nature Å¿eems expreÅ¿ly to have deny'd us that Priviledge, as if Å¿he had Å¿eem'd induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly to hide from us, under a thick Veil, the Manner, both of her Conception and Production; Å¿o that hitherto, our ordinary Faculties have not been able to fathom this myÅ¿terious Subject of Vegetation.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny but that there is a Circulation of the Blood in all Animals; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the VeÅ¿Å¿els with their Extremities and InÅ¿ertions, and indeed the whole Structure of their Body is Å¿o exactly entire, and perfect in all its Extent, as that we cannot conceive an abrupt Beginning or End of them. Hence it is that they are Å¿o excellently fitted for the Reception of the Blood and Spirits, and reÅ¿training them from iÅ¿Å¿uing out at any Extremity. But in Trees, whoÅ¿e encreaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in length is continually form'd outwardly, we muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e the VeÅ¿Å¿els to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at their Extremities, and that they receive their Augmentation in length, on their OutÅ¿ide, as the whole MaÅ¿s of the Tree doth; Å¿o that there is no Analogy between the VeÅ¿Å¿els in the Body of an Animal, and thoÅ¿e in a Tree, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Inference deduced from that CompariÅ¿on, muÅ¿t needs be erroneous.</p>
                     <p>The third QueÅ¿tion, wherein I deÅ¿ire to be Å¿atisfy'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether, upon Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition that there be Å¿uch a Circulation, we muÅ¿t Å¿ay that there is but one general Circulation in each reÅ¿pective Tree, or elÅ¿e that there are as many particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations as there are Branches, is perhaps as difficult to reÅ¿olve as any. For if we admit but one in general, we Å¿hall be hard put to it to give an Account how a Slip Å¿et in the Ground, comes to take, Å¿o as in a Å¿hort time to become a perfect Tree. We muÅ¿t be forc'd to Å¿ay, that in every one of theÅ¿e Branches there was a true Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, which ceas'd from Action as Å¿oon as they were cut off from the Tree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they grew; but that as Å¿oon as by their Re-plantation they were reÅ¿tor'd to a Condition of Acting of themÅ¿elves, their Circulation alÅ¿o began to reÅ¿ume its Action; and by theÅ¿e Steps they came to be perfect Trees.</p>
                     <p>If therefore, to give a ReaÅ¿on for this Growth of Slips, we muÅ¿t admit of a particular Circulation in every Branch, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be forc'd to admit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Circulations in every Branch. For Å¿ince any Branch may be divided into Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts, if every one of theÅ¿e Parts be Å¿et in the Ground, with all the due Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances belonging to them, they will as eaÅ¿ily take to grow, as if they had been entire Branches. But this Solution will draw us into a <hi>ProgreÅ¿Å¿us in infinitum,</hi> than which, in Ratiocination, nothing can be more abÅ¿urd.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when a Layer of a Vine being put into the Ground, takes a new Root, and thereupon that Part of the Layer next to the Earth, which before was the Å¿malleÅ¿t, becomes in a little time thicker than the Part next adjoyning to the Tree: MuÅ¿t we not of neceÅ¿Å¿ity have recourÅ¿e to a new Circulation, Å¿ince the former Å¿eems plainly to be at an end, or at leaÅ¿t to have become altogether uÅ¿eleÅ¿s I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s, I cannot find any Expedient of adjuÅ¿ting all theÅ¿e particular Circulations, with the general one, to make them act in Conformity with, and Subordination to it, when they are all together in the Å¿ame Tree at the Å¿ame time.</p>
                     <p>Such a Cloud of Difficulties and Inconveniencies have prevail'd with me not to give any Credit to this new Opinion of the Circulation of the <hi>Sap,</hi> though I have at the Å¿ame time an extreme Veneration for thoÅ¿e Worthy and Learned PerÅ¿ons, who are the Authors of it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Reflections upon the Opinion that maintains the Conveyance of the NouriÅ¿hment through the upper parts of the <hi>Plant.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere have been Å¿ome of Opinion that the NouriÅ¿hment of the Tree is not only derived to it through the <hi>Pores,</hi> and by the Operation of the <hi>Roots</hi> in the Earth, but that there is likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome Contribution of maintenance afforded by the Air, and Å¿ubtilly conveyed to it through the upper parts of the Tree. This Opinion of theirs is grounded upon this ObÅ¿ervation, That if you make a very Å¿trait liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture round any <hi>Branch,</hi> or even if you Å¿trip the <hi>Bark</hi> off it, the <hi>Boughs</hi> that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that part Å¿o tyed or Å¿tripp'd, will notwithÅ¿tanding encreaÅ¿e both in length and thickneÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>But to this I AnÅ¿wer, FirÅ¿t, That in Å¿ome <hi>Vegetables, viz.</hi> In <hi>Almonds,</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> as alÅ¿o in ordinary <hi>Seeds,</hi> there is no NeceÅ¿Å¿ity for this Aerial Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment, Å¿ince the whole Series of their <hi>Vegetation</hi> is performed in the Bowels of the Earth without having the leaÅ¿t Communication with the Air.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I AnÅ¿wer that it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to tye any <hi>Branch</hi> Å¿o Å¿traitly as that the <hi>Sap</hi> (a Liquor not only very Å¿ubtil and delicate, but alÅ¿o very Impetuous in its Operation) Å¿hall not inÅ¿inuate it Å¿elf, and find Å¿ome paÅ¿Å¿age through; for tho' the main Å¿tream of the <hi>Sap</hi> riÅ¿es up between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> yet it is certain that Å¿ome little quantity doth conÅ¿tantly penetrate through the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Å¿olid <hi>Wood,</hi> neither is it any Wonder if Nature, who out of her great abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> does frequently perform Å¿uch extraordinary and Å¿urprizing Wonders, may likewiÅ¿e in this caÅ¿e force up the <hi>Sap</hi> (which was Å¿top'd in its AÅ¿cent either by that ligature or Å¿tripping off the <hi>Bark)</hi> through the very Å¿ubÅ¿tance or <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Wood,</hi> in order to its NouriÅ¿hing the upper parts of the Tree, which muÅ¿t Infallibly have periÅ¿hed without a Å¿eaÅ¿onable Supply.</p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, I Å¿ay it may be AnÅ¿wer'd with very good ReaÅ¿on, that this DiÅ¿tenÅ¿ion or Tumor of Å¿uch tyed Branches in their breadth, and accretion to their length, may be Stiled rather a kind of DropÅ¿ie, than a real and firm Augmentation of their Å¿ound Å¿ubÅ¿tance and continuity; for Experience tells us, That in Trees thus tyed or Å¿tripp'd, the upper parts of the Tree come to dye in a very little time, as they muÅ¿t needs do if the Channel be not open'd again to give a free paÅ¿Å¿age to the true NouriÅ¿hment of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>Now to give Å¿ome other InÅ¿tances, to confirm our Opinion, we may conÅ¿ider that thoÅ¿e Plants whoÅ¿e <hi>Roots</hi> lye very deep in the Ground, as <hi>Tulip-bulbs,</hi> &amp;c. do always grow up to the greateÅ¿t heighth.</p>
                     <p>As alÅ¿o we may obÅ¿erve the <hi>Pointed</hi> and <hi>Pyramidal</hi> Extremity of all Branches; every one of which Å¿eem in the manner of their Growing, as with one conÅ¿ent, Naturally to tend upward.</p>
                     <p>To which we may add, as another Corroborating CircumÅ¿tance, the <hi>Å¿hooting</hi> out of new Sprouts, upon the Back or Elbow of Å¿uch Branches as are bent violently, or by force, to the Ground; the <hi>Suckers</hi> that grow out of the foot of the Tree when it has been injured at the top: the decay of the Branches at the Extremities notwithÅ¿tanding their being Å¿till vigorous at the <hi>Root,</hi> as alÅ¿o the Withering and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Plants at the top of their Leaves in hot Weather when they are newly Set: All theÅ¿e InÅ¿tances Å¿eem to me evidently Contradictory of any deÅ¿cent of the <hi>Sap</hi> which they Å¿uppoÅ¿e to be caus'd by the Influence of the Air, either upon the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Tree, or the Extremity of the Branches.</p>
                     <p>The different TaÅ¿tes in Fruits which always have a Å¿mack of their Soil, are a Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof that their NouriÅ¿hment is derived from a Soil of Å¿uch a Savour, and not from the Air, which has none at all; and certainly if any of the <hi>Sap</hi> could find a paÅ¿Å¿age acroÅ¿s, or through the Å¿olid Wood, it might as well enter in the Å¿ame manner through the Skin of the Fruit; and Å¿o the Stalk, which by a long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cription has hitherto been look'd upon as the true and only Channel for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the Aliment to the Fruit, would have a great many Partners in that Office, and conÅ¿equently become in a manner wholly uÅ¿eleÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny but that it is highly neceÅ¿Å¿ary for Trees to enjoy the benefit of a temperate Air, whereby the Bark may be rendered the more pliable and eaÅ¿ie to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48210:268"/>
be dilated and loos'd from its incloÅ¿ed <hi>Trunk,</hi> to give the freer paÅ¿Å¿age for the <hi>Sap</hi> in its riÅ¿ing up from the <hi>Root.</hi> Indeed, I can never be perÅ¿uaded to think that any NouriÅ¿hment can be conveyed through that <hi>Rind,</hi> but am of Opinion rather, that a Tree depriv'd of all its Top Branches, in a very hot Region; as for inÅ¿tance, we may Å¿uppoÅ¿e a Row of Trees cut even at the Tops, and Planted in a Hedge to the South under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> would be Å¿o far from drawing in any NouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the <hi>Bole,</hi> that even the <hi>Sap</hi> would be Å¿o much hindred by the heat of the Air from aÅ¿cending by its ordinary paÅ¿Å¿age, as that the upper part of the Tree would Infallibly periÅ¿h; whence it would follow, that the <hi>Sap</hi> being made unable to riÅ¿e up to the Å¿mall upper Boughs, would burÅ¿t out at the foot into an infinite number of new and Å¿mall Productions.</p>
                     <p>As for thoÅ¿e who from the Experiment of making an InciÅ¿ion into a Tree, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove this IntromiÅ¿Å¿ion of <hi>Sap</hi> into the upper part, or to defend the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Sap</hi> from that Liquor which will run plentifully out of Å¿uch an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, in my Opinion they build their HypotheÅ¿is upon a very Sandy Foundation.</p>
                     <p>For, FirÅ¿t, If we either cut or break off the Top of any <hi>Plant,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> will be Å¿een plainly to guÅ¿h out in great abundance from each of the two Extremities bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of every <hi>Pore,</hi> as well in that part which retain'd its Situation, as in the other which was Å¿eparated from the former.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the InciÅ¿ion be made at the bottom, there will run out not only Å¿ome part of that <hi>Sap</hi> which is continually aÅ¿cending, but alÅ¿o a little of that which being already upon its riÅ¿e, and having till then been Å¿upported by the Å¿ucceeding <hi>Sap,</hi> muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity fall down when deÅ¿titute of that Support and Foundation of which it was depriv'd by that InciÅ¿ion.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, If this InciÅ¿ion were a Å¿ufficient proof of this AÅ¿Å¿ertion, it muÅ¿t follow that all the uppermoÅ¿t <hi>Sap</hi> muÅ¿t make its way out at one Å¿ingle hole, as we Å¿ee the Water in a VeÅ¿Å¿el runs all out at any hole it meets with: But Experience tells us, That how many InciÅ¿ions Å¿oever you make, either above or below the firÅ¿t, the <hi>Sap</hi> will iÅ¿Å¿ue through all of them, but moÅ¿t abundantly through the loweÅ¿t, and in leaÅ¿t quantity through the higheÅ¿t, which certainly muÅ¿t proceed from the ReaÅ¿on which I have given before.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the undiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hable likeneÅ¿s of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Wood, Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere is hardly any <hi>Plant</hi> growing with us, during the whole Summer, puts out more <hi>Roots,</hi> and conÅ¿equently produces greater plenty of <hi>Sap,</hi> than the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> does; Å¿o that we may venture to build our ObÅ¿ervations concerning <hi>Sap</hi> in general, upon Å¿uch Remarks as a particular Enquiry into the Nature of this Tree will afford us: The <hi>Sap</hi> whereof appears to me to have exactly the Å¿ame Colour, TaÅ¿te, and ConÅ¿iÅ¿tence both in the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and the <hi>Stalk</hi> both of the <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> that it has in the <hi>Fruit</hi> it Å¿elf, whilÅ¿t it is yet Green; for when it comes to be Ripe and fit for Gathering, there is not the leaÅ¿t Å¿ign to be perceived of that white <hi>Sap</hi> with which it was Å¿o plentifully impregnated before it was come to Maturity.</p>
                     <p>From hence we may very well advance this general concluÅ¿ion, That there can be no material difference between that <hi>Sap</hi> which goes to the forming of the Fruit, and that which enters into the CompoÅ¿ition of all the other parts of the Tree, Å¿ince there is Å¿o great a Conformity between them at the time of its paÅ¿Å¿ing out of the Stalk into the Fruit. So that admitting the <hi>Sap</hi> for Fruit to be endued with Å¿ome particular degrees of Perfection beyond what are to be found in the <hi>Sap</hi> of the Tree, yet what do they think becomes of it, when the Fruit which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign'd to have form'd and nouriÅ¿h'd, chances to periÅ¿h, as oftentimes it doth, even in the <hi>Embryo,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t before it comes to Perfection? In this caÅ¿e it muÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be mixed with the reÅ¿t of the <hi>Sap,</hi> and be equally employ'd with it in the Production of Å¿omething that is not Fruit.</p>
                     <p>And this will Å¿uggeÅ¿t the ReaÅ¿on to us why Trees without Fruit abound more in Wood than thoÅ¿e that bear Fruit plentifully; which according to the Opinion I ever had, is nothing elÅ¿e but the different proportions of the <hi>Sap;</hi> the Å¿maller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48210:269"/>
whereof cauÅ¿es plenty of BloÅ¿Å¿oms and Fruits, as the greater quantity produces the like EncreaÅ¿e both in the Body and Leaves.</p>
                     <p>To this may be added, what I have already repeated Å¿o often, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Fruit grows at the Top of the weak Branches, but at the Bottom of the Å¿trong; whence it appears, that no part of the Branch is exempted from bearing, and that they are under a very great miÅ¿take, who, while they pretend to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why the weak Branches are generally moÅ¿t loaded with Fruit, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the Extremities, put us off with this ReaÅ¿on, That it is for the better concoction and refining of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which (Å¿ay they) can be effected no other way than by Å¿o long a PaÅ¿Å¿age and Percolation through the narrow Conveyances.</p>
                     <p>But Å¿uppoÅ¿e this Fancy had Å¿ome probability of ReaÅ¿on in it, how Å¿hall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Production of <hi>Grapes, Quinces, Mulberries, Azerolles, Rasberries, &amp;c.</hi> which receive their Formation at the Å¿ame time that the Wood does upon which they grow: For Example: There grows upon every old Branch of a <hi>Vine</hi> that uÅ¿ed to be Pruned in the Spring, as many new Branches as there were Eyes left upon it. Upon theÅ¿e Branches, and at the very Å¿ame time with them are the <hi>Grapes</hi> formed, which ordinarily do not grow nearer to the end than the third, fourth, or fifth Knot, for from that diÅ¿tance the Branch runs up only in length, without bearing any Fruit.</p>
                     <p>This being granted, which indeed cannot be denied, I would ask them what Ground they have to aÅ¿Å¿ert, That the <hi>Sap</hi> is not Å¿ufficiently prepared till it arrive at one of theÅ¿e three Eyes, and there receive its perfect DigeÅ¿tion: for they divide the <hi>Sap</hi> into two Å¿orts, <hi>viz.</hi> DigeÅ¿ted, and IndigeÅ¿ted; the former they tell us is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed both in forming the <hi>Grapes</hi> in Å¿ome one of thoÅ¿e three Knots, and in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Leaves and Branches; and yet there is always Å¿ome Wood, Pulp, and Husk of the <hi>Grape</hi> between every one of theÅ¿e Knots, to the Formation of which both theÅ¿e <hi>Saps</hi> did contribute.</p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, After this Secretion of the DigeÅ¿ted <hi>Sap</hi> from the IndigeÅ¿ted, they come both of them to be re-united in order to the Production of Boughs and Leaves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the remaining part of the Year. I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s ingenuouÅ¿ly, I am not quick enough to penetrate into, and comprehend theÅ¿e Å¿o Å¿ubtile and refined No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our modern PhiloÅ¿ophers.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the Opinion of thoÅ¿e, who from the Generation of Animals Argue concerning the Production of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are Å¿ome, as I have formerly obÅ¿erved in my <hi>TreatiÅ¿e of Pruning,</hi> who Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Production of <hi>Fruits,</hi> proceed the Å¿ame way they do in their ConÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Generation of <hi>Animals. Animals</hi> (Å¿ay they) <hi>do not Procreate their Like, but when they are in their Vigor, Generation being an Act of Vigor in all Natural Productions.</hi> Now Å¿ince <hi>Trees</hi> are alÅ¿o Natural Beings, 'twill hence follow, that they are never Capable of bearing Fruit, but when they are in their full Strength and Vigour, it being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urd to make the Production of <hi>Fruit</hi> a Å¿ign of the WeakneÅ¿s of the <hi>Tree.</hi> And they further add. <hi>That in all the Works of Nature, the CauÅ¿e is known by the Effects, and every</hi> Extraordinary <hi>Effect muÅ¿t be produced by a Å¿uitable Strength and Vigour in its Agent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e indeed are very plauÅ¿ible Arguments and Inferences, and which, when mentioned by PerÅ¿ons of Reputation, may prevail with Å¿uch as do not Å¿ee into the WeakneÅ¿s of them.</p>
                     <p>But though I highly EÅ¿teem the PerÅ¿ons, and the Works of thoÅ¿e Ingenious Men, who Argue after this manner; yet, when to expoÅ¿e my Notions, they make me Advance Å¿uch a one as this: <q>That the abundance of MoiÅ¿ture which makes the <hi>Trees</hi> produce a great quantity of Branches and Leaves, is an Effect of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour;</q> they muÅ¿t give me leave to Å¿ay Å¿omething in my own Defence. I might well Å¿ay, and now I Å¿ay it again, That <hi>BloÅ¿Å¿oms</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> on <hi>Trees</hi> are Å¿igns of their WeakneÅ¿s, or, that they have but little <hi>Sap;</hi> as on the contrary, a great number of fair <hi>Branches</hi> without <hi>Fruit,</hi> is of the Vigour, or of the abounding quantity of their <hi>Sap.</hi> For I do not think that the word <hi>MoiÅ¿ture</hi> does properly Å¿ignifie the <hi>Sap</hi> in a <hi>Tree,</hi> and therefore Å¿hould not be underÅ¿tood in that AÅ¿Å¿ertion of mine for any thing elÅ¿e, but the <hi>moiÅ¿ture</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> where a <hi>Tree</hi> is planted; there being Å¿o great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48210:269"/>
a Difference between it and <hi>Sap.</hi> And we Å¿eldom Å¿ee any very great Quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> in Å¿uch Fruit-Trees as have very much MoiÅ¿ture about their Roots. Nay, We Å¿ometimes Å¿ee them die, by having their Roots too much drenched in Water; and they will never take well in very wet Ground; whereas, for the moÅ¿t part, they afford both much <hi>Lop-wood</hi> and Fruit, if they have naturally a Vigorous vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and are planted in a good Earth, indifferently moÅ¿ten'd, and do thereupon Å¿end forth good Roots to furniÅ¿h the upper Parts with a Å¿ufficient Quantity of <hi>Sap.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e Terms therefore of <hi>MoiÅ¿ture</hi> and <hi>Sap,</hi> are not to be promiÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly uÅ¿ed, the one being to be underÅ¿tood only for that NouriÅ¿hment which is in the Tree, and the other for Å¿uch Water as may be about the Root of it.</p>
                     <p>That which has given OccaÅ¿ion for Mens arguing upon the Production of Plants, after the Å¿ame manner they do upon the Generation of Animals, has been this, as I conceive, that they imagin'd the Fruit to be the Å¿ame, in reÅ¿pect to the Tree, that the young Animal is to its Syre that begat it; and wou'd thence conclude, that as Lyon's Whelp'd, for InÅ¿tance, exactly reÅ¿embles its Syre in all its EÅ¿Å¿entials, Å¿o a Pear, or a Cherry muÅ¿t, in its Formation, that of its Tree, Å¿eeing that in time it may grow up to be as tall and big, and every way like it, juÅ¿t as the young Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does at length equal the Old One, both in LargeneÅ¿s and Proportion of Parts.</p>
                     <p>Now Nature it Å¿elf plainly Å¿hews us, that it does not act the Å¿ame way in both theÅ¿e CaÅ¿es; and that the moÅ¿t that can be gather'd from Å¿uch ConÅ¿iderations, is, hat one Part of the Fruit of each Å¿ort of Trees, is the Å¿ame with reÅ¿pect to its Tree, that the Seed of the Animals is to its reÅ¿pective Animal.</p>
                     <p>I am not Å¿o well skill'd in Anatomy, as to know, whether the Seminal Matter in Animals require as much Force and Vigor to be formed in the Body, as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards does in being duly employ'd in order to Generation: But Å¿ure I am that no Man ever diÅ¿tinctly perceiv'd in himÅ¿elf, either the Time or Manner of its Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any more than he did thoÅ¿e CircumÅ¿tances of the Formation of his MuÅ¿cles, Bones, or Cartilages: and that 'tis certainly a ProviÅ¿ion in Nature, that of the whole MaÅ¿s of NouriÅ¿hment, one Part Å¿hould go to the making of Seed, and the reÅ¿t Å¿hould be imployed either to the EncreaÅ¿e, or the PreÅ¿ervation of the Animal, without ever making any Å¿enÅ¿ible Effort, either in Framing, or perfecting any of the Internal Parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>And beÅ¿ides, he will find himÅ¿elf mightily miÅ¿taken, that Å¿hall lay down this as a Å¿tanding Rule, that every kind of Fruit is in the Nature of a CaÅ¿e to Å¿uch a Seed as is capable of producing the Å¿ame Å¿ort of Tree with that it Å¿elf grew upon. The moÅ¿t ordinary way of Multiplying Trees, being not by their Fruits. And indeed who ever Å¿aw a <hi>Prunier de Perdrigon,</hi> or a <hi>Bigarotier</hi> grow from the Stones of the Fruit? a <hi>Fig,</hi> or <hi>Mulberry-Tree</hi> from the <hi>Seed,</hi> a <hi>Bon-ChreÅ¿tien,</hi> or <hi>Bergamotte</hi> from the Kernels of Å¿uch Pears? Though I know 'tis common for an Oak to come of an <hi>Acorn,</hi> and a CheÅ¿tnut-Tree of its Nuts, and Å¿ome others to be produc'd in the Å¿ame way; yet Nature has provided other ways of multiplying them, <hi>viz.</hi> by young Siens growing out at the Roots, and Å¿everal Å¿orts of Graffs. Some of thoÅ¿e ways which Nature makes uÅ¿e of in preÅ¿erving the Å¿everal Kinds of Trees, I have already treated of in another Place: And now I come poÅ¿itively to affirm,</p>
                     <p>That if a Man firÅ¿t lays down Å¿uch a Maxim as this, that the only ReaÅ¿on why Å¿ome Fir-Trees thrive well, is, becauÅ¿e they grow on the South Å¿ide of a Mountain; And that others do not, becauÅ¿e they Å¿tand on the North Side of it: And thence draw Inferences, and apply them to Fruit-Trees, Å¿uch Arguments muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be very weak, for theÅ¿e two Å¿orts of Trees are Å¿ubjects very different, and therefore Å¿hould be as differently conÅ¿idered.</p>
                     <p>For what is chiefly to be conÅ¿idered in Fruit-Trees, is Å¿carcely at all taken notice of in Firrs. In theÅ¿e latter, we are only to compare one Part with another, that is, barely to conÅ¿ider the whole Bulk and Extent of the Tree, to Å¿ee whether it be good for MaÅ¿ts, Planks, Beams, or JoiÅ¿ts. But in the other, all the Branches are to be carefully conÅ¿idered, both the Great and Small, which may be of uÅ¿e, and which not. In theÅ¿e we obÅ¿erve the <hi>Working</hi> of Nature, in DiÅ¿tributing the <hi>Sap</hi> to every Å¿ingle Part of the Tree. But in the other, only to what particular UÅ¿e it may be put in the Building of a Ship. Nature is not concern'd whether Å¿uch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Firr-Tree be fit for Boards, and whether, or no, it be put to that UÅ¿e; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may not be improperly Å¿aid, that Å¿he is highly concerned in the Productions of Fruit-Trees, which are to bethe Food of the nobleÅ¿t Part of the Creation. And yet of all that is performed in the whole CourÅ¿e of Vegetation, theÅ¿e Fruits
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48210:270"/>
coÅ¿t Nature the leaÅ¿t pains in making, and the PhiloÅ¿opher the moÅ¿t in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them.</p>
                     <p>And the more to puzzle and confound the Curious Enquirers in the Works of Nature, it proceeds in the Formation and NouriÅ¿hment of Trees in a way quite different from that wherein perfect Animals are Generated and PreÅ¿erved; As if it thereby deÅ¿igned to prevent the drawing of any manner of ConÅ¿equences from the one, whereby to underÅ¿tand or illuÅ¿trate the other.</p>
                     <p>The DiÅ¿tribution of NouriÅ¿hment in perfect Animals is made in equal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to each of the Members, which exactly anÅ¿wer one another; Å¿o that the Right Arm or Thigh uÅ¿ually receives no more than the Left; and Å¿o of the reÅ¿t: Whereas in Fruit-Trees the Sap is diÅ¿tributed in very unequal MeaÅ¿ures; few of the Branches being perfectly of the Å¿ame bigneÅ¿s, but Å¿ome very large, others very Å¿mall, and a third Å¿ort of a middle Å¿ize between both; and conÅ¿equently requiring a proportionable Quantity of Sap.</p>
                     <p>It alÅ¿o Å¿ometimes happens that Å¿ome of the Å¿maller Branches receiving more Sap than that particular uÅ¿e for which they Å¿eem'd to be deÅ¿igned, did require, grow in a Å¿hort time to an extraordinary bigneÅ¿s; and on the contrary, others that at firÅ¿t Å¿eem'd large ones, receiving a leÅ¿s Quantity of Sap than was neceÅ¿Å¿ary, never grow much bigger than thoÅ¿e of the Å¿maller Å¿ize.</p>
                     <p>And this may not unfitly be illuÅ¿trated by thoÅ¿e Alterations we frequently obÅ¿erve in Å¿ome Rivers, where the Main Stream does not always go in the very Å¿ame place: Sometimes you'll Å¿ee it bear Å¿trongly upon one Bank, and within a few Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, quite removed to the oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide, or elÅ¿e Å¿ettle in the midÅ¿t between both. Only 'tis to be obÅ¿erved, that whether Å¿ide Å¿oever it takes to, it commonly makes no very long continuance there.</p>
                     <p>For after the very Å¿ame manner, we frequently Å¿ee Å¿trange Alterations in the Motion of the Sap in the Boughs, which are properly its Channel, and where it never conÅ¿tantly keeps the Å¿ame courÅ¿e it firÅ¿t took. One Year it flows in Å¿o great a quantity into one of the Å¿maller Boughs, which was juÅ¿t upon bearing, that it quite alters its DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, and puts it upon lengthening and enlarging it Å¿elf; that Matter which otherwiÅ¿e would have been Fruit, aÅ¿Å¿uming the Nature of, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Wood.</p>
                     <p>The next Year it may happen, that what formerly was employ'd in enlarging the Boughs, now changes its Office, and feeds them chiefly in order to the bearing of Fruit.</p>
                     <p>Another Year you Å¿hall Å¿ee a Branch, which at firÅ¿t look'd as if it would have grown into a MaÅ¿Å¿ive Bough, begin all on a Å¿uddain to bear; the Channel through which the Sap paÅ¿Å¿ed before in a great quantity, being Å¿ome way altered, and thereby the Branch hinder'd from growing any bigger than thoÅ¿e of the leÅ¿Å¿er Å¿ize.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis further obÅ¿ervable, that Nature has for each kind of perfect Animals its own peculiar Mould, wherein they are all as it were caÅ¿t exactly into the very Å¿ame Å¿hape, and have Å¿uch an Air as makes them very nearly reÅ¿emble each other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the DeÅ¿igning and Forming of Fruit-Trees, it neither obÅ¿erves Proportion of Parts, nor Equality in BigneÅ¿s, nor ReÅ¿emblance in Shape. In perfect Animals, the Eyes and the Ears, the Belly and the Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are always orderly placed in the Å¿ame Parts of the Body: And none of theÅ¿e is ever Å¿uffered to grow in a wrong place, but when Å¿ome frightful MonÅ¿ter is to be produced: Whereas the Care of Nature is no further concerned about Fruit-Trees, but only that they Å¿end forth large Boughs, and yield good Fruit, whether it be on the top or below, on one Å¿ide or the other: Nay, it Å¿eems willing Å¿o far to comply with the Ingenious Gardiner, as to obÅ¿erve his Orders and Conduct in the Management of Trees, Å¿uffering them to receive what Å¿hape he Å¿hall appoint them, and even to produce what Branches and Fruit he will, and where he pleaÅ¿es.</p>
                     <p>Now Å¿ince many Productions may be in a Tree at the Å¿ame time, and there is no one Exteriour part of it which is not capable of producing, whereas this Work of Nature is only performed in one certain part of Animals; How unreaÅ¿onable is it to argue in all things concerning the Production of Trees, from the Generation of Animals?</p>
                     <p>There is a certain CourÅ¿e of Action in the Sap, which very few have the CurioÅ¿ity nicely to obÅ¿erve; and Å¿ome are Å¿o wholly taken up with Studies of a higher and more delightful Nature, or with BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s of greater Importance, that they cannot Å¿ufficiently apply themÅ¿elves to Å¿uch ObÅ¿ervations. And though it would be a very

great AccompliÅ¿hment in any PerÅ¿on that has attained to Å¿ome conÅ¿iderable Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in two or three Sciences, if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible for him to make himÅ¿elf as much MaÅ¿ter of all the reÅ¿t; Yet a Man may properly be Å¿aid to be a Good AÅ¿tronomer, a Geometrician, or Architect, though he be not perfectly well Skill'd in all the other Arts and Sciences. And it would be an unjuÅ¿t CenÅ¿ure, to Å¿ay, That Å¿uch a Man is no Good Architect, becauÅ¿e he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o a Good Gardiner. For though an Architects Skill in Building might juÅ¿tly be Å¿uÅ¿pected, who Å¿hould make a HouÅ¿e with Smoaking Chimneys, or Rooms that would not hold a Bed; Yet, 'twould be hard to QueÅ¿tion the Å¿ame Man's Abilities in Architecture, becauÅ¿e the Trees in his Orchard were not all well Ordered, or did not bear abundance of Good and Fair Fruit.</p>
                     <p>And Å¿peaking with Reference to a Gardiner, there are a great many Parts of curious Knowledge which he has no UÅ¿e of in his way, and would not in the leaÅ¿t contribute to the Advancement of his Skill or Art. As for inÅ¿tance, When one knows that the Marble of Å¿uch a Mountain at <hi>Genoua,</hi> or the Stone of <hi>Carriere de St. Leu</hi> are very good and fine, either to Build with, or to make Statues of; whereas thoÅ¿e of other Places are much CourÅ¿er, and leÅ¿s fit for Å¿uch UÅ¿es: Pray, Why Å¿hould a Man break his Brain to find out the ReaÅ¿ons of the Excellency of the one, the Imperfections of the other, Å¿ince he can neither Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the one, nor make the other laÅ¿t for ever? All that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary in this CaÅ¿e, is, To know where to find the beÅ¿t, when he Å¿hall have occaÅ¿ion to make uÅ¿e of it; and where the bad is, that he may not meddle with it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> the Firrs that grow on the South-Å¿ide of a Mountain are much better than thoÅ¿e that grow on the North Å¿ide of it. This many of us know upon our own Experience. But I believe a Man would find himÅ¿elf mightily miÅ¿taken, if without any regard to the difference of the Earth, he Å¿hould thence conclude, that the only ReaÅ¿on why the latter are Bad, is becauÅ¿e they grew up expoÅ¿ed to the North: For all our Modern Mariners agree, That the beÅ¿t Firrs for MaÅ¿ts come from the moÅ¿t Northern Parts of <hi>Norway;</hi> Or if on the contrary, he Å¿hould lay down this as the only ReaÅ¿on why Firrs that Å¿tand expoÅ¿ed to the South, are the BeÅ¿t; namely, BecauÅ¿e nothing elÅ¿e but the exceÅ¿Å¿ive Heat of the Sun can <hi>compreÅ¿s</hi> the Parts of that matter wherewith they are NouriÅ¿hed, and conÅ¿equently harden and Å¿trengthen the Fibers of Å¿uch Trees more than of thoÅ¿e that are not Å¿o directly expoÅ¿ed to its Influence: How will this way of Arguing hold concerning Å¿uch Firrs as are almoÅ¿t continually in a Frozen Condition? Pray, Is not Cold as apt to cloÅ¿e, and harden, and Å¿trengthen any thing as Heat? And is it not as uÅ¿ual for Rains to come from the South, as from the North? And conÅ¿equently are not Å¿uch things as as lie to the South, as liable to be kept moiÅ¿t, as thoÅ¿e that lie towards the North?</p>
                     <p>From all which it appears, how unÅ¿afe it is, in Treating of Vegetation, to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on General ConÅ¿iderations; And that it is much better to examine Particulars; And that not barely with a DeÅ¿ign to Feed and Gratifie a vain and uÅ¿eleÅ¿s CurioÅ¿ity, but eÅ¿pecially to diÅ¿cover Å¿omething that may be of real UÅ¿e and Benefit to the ArtiÅ¿t in the way of his ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion. We Å¿hall therefore take little or no notice of Å¿uch Notions, as being but barely probable, are not Å¿ufficient to advance any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Maxime upon; and keep our Å¿elves from paying too great a defference to the Authority, and being PrepoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed with all the Opinions of PerÅ¿ons, who, not contenting themÅ¿elves to know, and to be juÅ¿tly eÅ¿teemed for their Skill in Å¿ome Things, take upon them to lay down Rules in others they do not Å¿o well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand.</p>
                     <p>Every Body knows that Trees that grow in an open Plain, and in a dry Earth, yield more <hi>Top-Wood</hi> then Å¿uch as grow in a ForeÅ¿t, and in a moiÅ¿t Ground. But I believe it matters not much whether Å¿uch Trees as grow in a Plain be more expoÅ¿ed to the South, or to the North; Such PoÅ¿itions being in Å¿ome Countries not at all taken notice of. And this is evident, particularly in the Vines of <hi>VerÅ¿enay,</hi> which are much better when they are expoÅ¿ed to the North, then to the South, notwithÅ¿tanding that <note n="*" place="margin">AuÅ¿ter vites Å¿ibi objectas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitat, Aquilo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How NeceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿oever the Heat and Influences of the <hi>Sun</hi> may be in themÅ¿elves, and how advantageouÅ¿ly Å¿oever any Plant may be expoÅ¿ed to it, yet if it have not the Benefit of a good Earth, as well as the ProÅ¿pect of the Mid-day, or Afternoon Sun, we very Å¿eldom Å¿ee that its Productions are any way Extraordinary. Hence comes that vaÅ¿t Difference we Å¿ee in <hi>Vines,</hi> that have all exactly the Å¿ame PoÅ¿ition towards the Sun: And hence alÅ¿o it comes that we have Å¿o much MarÅ¿h Ground that is wholly UÅ¿eleÅ¿s, Å¿o many Plains that are Rich and Fruitful even without Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and Å¿o many Mountains that produce nothing at all. If the <hi>Pipes</hi> of an <hi>Organ,</hi> or any other InÅ¿trument, be not good and well made, to what purpoÅ¿e is it to put them into the moÅ¿t Skillful MuÅ¿icians Hand? Are not all Mens Souls of the Å¿ame Immaterial SubÅ¿tance, and equally Perfect in themÅ¿elves? To what therefore Å¿hall we aÅ¿cribe that Wonderful Difference we find between the Abilities of WiÅ¿e Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters of State, or Great PhiloÅ¿ophers, and the others who are Å¿o Dull and Rude, that they are capable neither of Ingenious Arts, nor Common Civility, but to the Difference of their Temper, and of the Organs of their Body?</p>
                     <p>'Tis moÅ¿t certain therefore, that the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi> DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the <hi>Earth</hi> is chiefly to be look'd upon as the Principal CauÅ¿e of whatÅ¿oever Difference we find in its ProductionsâAnd in order to the Å¿everal uÅ¿es they are to be put to, all that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be here further obÅ¿erved, is, That Å¿uch Trees as grow in large and thick ForeÅ¿ts are much taller, and their Timber Å¿treighter than thoÅ¿e that grow in thin <hi>Woods</hi> or <hi>Thickets.</hi>âThe ReaÅ¿on whereof may be this, That every <hi>Tree</hi> having a kind of Natural DeÅ¿ire to Enjoy the Benefit of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and as it were Fearing to be Å¿tifled by the cloÅ¿eneÅ¿s and over-topping of thoÅ¿e next it, endeavours to raiÅ¿e its Head Å¿o high as to reach the free and open Air: And all of them having, if I may Å¿o call it, this Natural InÅ¿tinct, each endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top the reÅ¿t; and Å¿o all of them grow to a much greater height than thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand alone: And if Å¿uch a ForeÅ¿t happen to be very thick, the Trees growing up too haÅ¿tily to an exceÅ¿Å¿ive height, have not a proportionable Bulk, whereas Å¿uch as grow up more at liberty, having no Å¿uch NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of growing high on a Å¿udden, make the beÅ¿t advantage of their NouriÅ¿hment, grow up leiÅ¿urely, and with a thickneÅ¿s anÅ¿werable to their height.</p>
                     <p>And this may be Å¿ufficient to Å¿atisfie our CurioÅ¿ity, as well as to Direct the ArtiÅ¿t what Å¿ort of <hi>Trees</hi> may be fit, and which not, for his Å¿everal purpoÅ¿es in <hi>Building.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall now, in the laÅ¿t place, conÅ¿ider thoÅ¿e SuperÅ¿titious ObÅ¿ervations our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Gard'ners</hi> make upon the Influences of the <hi>Moon</hi> in its Wain and Full.</p>
                     <p>I know they will take it ill, that I Å¿hould look upon that as a piece of SuperÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nay as downright Folly, which they pretend to have been the conÅ¿tant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation and Practice of all Times, and in all Parts of the World.âThey will tell you that, according to the Opinion of the Ancients, every <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> is in a kind of Wain; and that above all the reÅ¿t, <hi>Good Friday</hi> is to be made choice of for Sowing all manner of Seeds; inÅ¿omuch that Sowing upon that day Å¿uch whoÅ¿e Fruit you would have to be early Ripe, they will perÅ¿wade you that they will be Ripe exactly at the time you expect, Å¿uch for InÅ¿tance, as <hi>Melons, Cucumbers, PeaÅ¿e,</hi> &amp;c.âAs alÅ¿o that thoÅ¿e you would not have to come Å¿o Å¿oon to their Maturity, will as exactly AnÅ¿wer your Expectation, namely all Å¿orts of <hi>Pot-Herbs, Coleworts, Lettuces, Ofeilles,</hi> &amp;c. And all this doubtleÅ¿s out of a profound ReÅ¿pect they bear to the day whereon they were Å¿et. And that Å¿uch as are Å¿et in any other time of the <hi>Moon</hi> do quite fail the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Expectations.</p>
                     <p>This they will not be convinced to be a groÅ¿s DeluÅ¿ion, as are alÅ¿o Å¿everal others which they have received by a kind of Tradition from the Ancients, namely Å¿uch as theÅ¿e, That neither <hi>Plants,</hi> nor <hi>Graffs,</hi> nor <hi>Lopped Trees,</hi> will be quick in Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleÅ¿s they be Å¿et, or cut in the Wain of the <hi>Moon.</hi> And that Å¿o many days as any of theÅ¿e is done after the Full, Å¿o many years the Å¿ooner will the Trees come to their Perfection in Bearing.</p>
                     <p>And they poÅ¿itively AÅ¿Å¿ert, That the only ReaÅ¿on why Å¿ome Trees are Å¿o long before they Bear, is becauÅ¿e they were either Set, or Cut, or Graffed while the <hi>Moon</hi> was either in the EncreaÅ¿e, or at the FullâThis they contend for as a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48210:271"/>
matter of UniverÅ¿al Experience, and beyond all manner of DiÅ¿pute, notwithÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that can be Å¿aid, or Å¿hewn to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But for my part, I think there is nothing more Ridiculous, whether we conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Things themÅ¿elves they contend for, or their way of Proving what they AÅ¿Å¿ert.</p>
                     <p>As to the Things themÅ¿elves, I profeÅ¿s that I have for above 30 years, obÅ¿erved with all the exactneÅ¿s imaginable, whether the Å¿everal <hi>PhaÅ¿es</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> have Å¿uch different Influences upon <hi>Gardening,</hi> to the end I might follow an Opinion Å¿o Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ally received, if it Å¿hould prove true: And that after all, I find that all this is no more than the Old Sayings of Å¿ome Unexperienced and Ignorant <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who deÅ¿igned thereby to cover their own Ignorance, and hoped to be remember'd for Å¿uch <hi>Jargon</hi> among Å¿uch as knew nothing at all of Husbandry.</p>
                     <p>I Å¿hould be the BoldeÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t InÅ¿olent Man in the World, if I Å¿hould Decry, or go about to DiÅ¿prove a Maxim that has obtained for Å¿o many Ages, and is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Å¿o many PerÅ¿ons Å¿o Å¿trongly perÅ¿waded of its Truth, and Å¿o Zealous in the Defence of it, if I had not the Authority of a long Experience free from all manner of Prejudice, to confirm what I advance againÅ¿t it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, I have plaid the Critick in all the Å¿everal Parts of <hi>Gardening;</hi> and laying aÅ¿ide the Authority of Authors, and Modern Practice, I have expoÅ¿ed the Errors of the one, and the Faults of the other: All which I have done with no other DeÅ¿ign but only to Confirm and Improve what I found to be Good, and to Undeceive the World in what upon Experience proved to be otherwiÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>And among theÅ¿e latter I may juÅ¿tly reckon this SuperÅ¿titious ObÅ¿ervation of the <hi>Moons</hi> Wain; for in what Quarter of the <hi>Moon</hi> Å¿oever you Set your <hi>Graffs,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you do it well, and at Å¿uch times of the Year as are proper for Å¿uch or Å¿uch <hi>Graffs;</hi> and upon Å¿uch Trees as Suit with the <hi>Graffs</hi> you Å¿et upon them, that the Stock be good, and rightly Qualified, that it neither Å¿end up too much, nor too little <hi>Sap;</hi> and that the <hi>Graff</hi>

                        </gap>e neither too Å¿trong, nor too weak, your Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will, if not always, yet for the moÅ¿t part, have the Å¿ame SucceÅ¿s: Or if the <hi>Graff</hi> happen to fail, you will have no occaÅ¿ion to blame your Å¿elf for it.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, Sow or Set any Å¿ort of <hi>Seeds</hi> or <hi>Plants,</hi> in all the Å¿everal Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and I will promiÅ¿e you the Å¿ame SucceÅ¿s in all, provided your Earth be good and well prepared; that there be no Fault in your Seeds or Plants, and that the SeaÅ¿on be favourable: And that the firÅ¿t day of the <hi>Moon</hi> will be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as good for that purpoÅ¿e as the laÅ¿t.â</p>
                     <p>Having thus conÅ¿ider'd the thing it Å¿elf, we may, in the laÅ¿t place, look into the AbÅ¿urdity of it: For indeed, how it is poÅ¿Å¿ible that one and the Å¿ame Influence of the <hi>Moon</hi> in one particular PoÅ¿ition, Å¿hould at the Å¿ame time affect Plants after Å¿uch a different manner, and produce in them quite contrary Effects.â'Twould be a rare Secret indeed, if the <hi>Moon</hi> Å¿hould hold an Intelligence with the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> cauÅ¿ing Å¿ome of his Plants to Spring up apace, and hindering the Growth of others, juÅ¿t as he would have them.âNothing certainly would be of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the way of <hi>Gardening</hi> than this, if it were True; but Å¿ince nothing is more repugnant either to ReaÅ¿on or Experience; and that I hope Men will grow WiÅ¿er than to Trouble themÅ¿elves any longer about it, I Å¿hall Å¿pare my Å¿elf the Pains of expoÅ¿ing it any further.</p>
