            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEfore I enter upon the matter of the <hi>Subject</hi> I have undertaken, I think my Self obliged to advertiſe you, That <hi>Gardening</hi> is not among us <hi>Moderns,</hi> what it was in the firſt <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> In thoſe early times 'tis probable, they knew no other <hi>Gardens</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes,</hi> which we now call <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Gardens;</hi> whereas in our Days, there are ſeveral other ſorts beſides them, ſome being for <hi>Parterres</hi> and <hi>Flowers,</hi> ſome for <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> ſome only for plain <hi>Gardens</hi> for <hi>Common Uſe,</hi> and others for <hi>Rare</hi> and <hi>Medicinal Plants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So great a multiplicity of different ſorts of <hi>Gardens,</hi> affording no leſs diverſity of employments for <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> in proceſs of time, introduced ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Claſſes</hi> of them; ſome being ſimply called <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> others taking the quality of <hi>Floriſts,</hi> and others well deſerving the Title of <hi>Botaniſts,</hi> and others being named, <note n="*" place="margin">Verbatim. Marſh Gard'ners.</note> Market Gard'ners, beſides thoſe that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only to the raiſing and maintaining of <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> for which there wants yet a particular Term, unleſs we ſhould call them <hi>Nurſery Gard'ners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the explication of the <hi>Original,</hi> and eſtabliſhment of which ſeveral <hi>Ranks</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> I think it will not be impertinent to beſtow a few Lines, before we paſs further.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Opinion</hi> in this Matter, is, That the <hi>Firſt Man</hi> having been Created in a <hi>Garden,</hi> and received Orders after his Tranſgreſſion, to till the <hi>Earth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Original of the Diverſity of <hi>Gardens. Ex ea vives in laboribus omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus diebus vitae tuae.</hi> Geneſ. cap. v.</note> and to get his Maintenance out of it by the <hi>Sweat</hi> of his <hi>Brows.</hi> It follows from thence, that one of the chiefeſt Employments, both of <hi>Himſelf</hi> and his firſt <hi>Deſcendants,</hi> was to apply themſelves to the culture of <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes;</hi> that being then the <hi>Function</hi> which alone ſupplyed <hi>Humane Kind,</hi> with all the neceſſaries of <hi>Life.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Ground</hi> ſo tilled, did it not conſiſt of true <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Gardens?</hi> And conſequently, becauſe in thoſe firſt <hi>Ages,</hi> no other <hi>Gardens</hi> were known but ſuch, there could be no other <hi>Gard'ners</hi> neither, but thoſe which govern'd them, who may on that account, be juſtly eſteemed the firſt of the whole <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners.</hi> For the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> properly ſpeaking, were thoſe firſt <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Gard'ners,</hi> and continued to perform that <hi>Function,</hi> till being diverted by their Application to the <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make uſe of the Service of ſome principal <hi>Domeſtick</hi> to help them in their <hi>Gardens,</hi> who diſdained not to take the Name of that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtand by the Term of <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Ages</hi> following, as ſoon as Men thought they had made a ſufficient proviſion for their Neceſſities, and there begun to be eſtabliſh'd among them, ſome diſtinction of Degrees and Fortunes; it hapned that the Pleaſures of the <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi> inſpired ſome Perſons with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to gratifie them with <hi>Flowers</hi> agreeable to one or both of thoſe <hi>Senſes,</hi> and accordingly, they begun to gather together ſome of all thoſe <hi>Beautiful Plants</hi> which they obſerv'd ſo curiouſly to enamel, and ſo admirably to perfume the Fields, where they were before confuſedly diſperſed.</p>
            <p>Thus was the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Flowers</hi> begun indeed by ſuch <hi>Gard'ners</hi> as thoſe we juſt now mentioned, becauſe there were no others that could do it; but when Men had a mind to have ſo great a number of them, as is now practiſed by way of Ornament, to the palaces of <hi>Great Perſons,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to make particular <hi>Gardens</hi> of them which they called by a name
<pb facs="tcp:48210:4"/>
proper to a <hi>Flower Garden;</hi> and becauſe it was not poſſible for one <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ner</hi> at the ſame time, to manage the <hi>Culture</hi> of ſo great a number of <hi>Fruits, Legumes, Flowers, Shrubs,</hi> &amp;c. as were then required, there was a neceſſity of eſtabliſhing a ſecond <hi>Claſs</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> to eaſe thoſe of the firſt, which new <hi>Gard'ners</hi> were commonly named <hi>Floriſts,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the others, which were called only plain <hi>Gard'ners.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Flower Gard'ners <hi>or</hi> Floriſh.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I might tell you here by the way, that in thoſe times, <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-trees,</hi> were perhaps look'd upon as Trees only for <hi>Flowers,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Myrtles, Jeſſimins,</hi> and <hi>Lauruſtinus-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. are now, the delicacy of Mens palates being not arrived to that degree of Luxury, to ſeek after ſo many ſorts of Reliſhes, Sawces, and ſeaſonings as now; ſo that 'tis very poſſible, that <hi>Limon</hi> and <hi>Orange-trees</hi> might then belong only to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> of the <hi>Floriſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet methinks it may be more probably affirmed, that in thoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly times, thoſe Trees were not diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Fruit-trees,</hi> ſince they are truly ſo; and therefore I am apt to believe, they were cultivated by the firſt <hi>Gard'ners</hi> only for their <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that the rather, becauſe the firſt <hi>Culture</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> being begun in hot and temperate Countries; the ſlavery and trouble of <hi>Boxes,</hi> and <hi>Conſervatories,</hi> which in our <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> they cannot be without, were there of no uſe at all. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rigour of the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon in cooler Regions that gave occaſion to thoſe Inventions for the preſerving of thoſe plants that were of too tender a Conſtitution to endure any great Cold, and then the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> of the ſecond Claſs, who otherwiſe were not over-much taken up with the <hi>Culture</hi> of their <hi>Flowers,</hi> begun to be charged with the care of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Limon-trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, the affectation of Men to gratiſie the Pleaſure of their Eyes, inciting them to puſh on things to more and more Perfection; there came firſt into the minds of Noble Perſons, ſome conceits of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thoſe <hi>Flowers</hi> with a little more agreeableneſs and <hi>Symmetry</hi> than was practiſed by the firſt <hi>Curioſi's,</hi> which gave the firſt beginning to <hi>Parterres,</hi> or <hi>Flower-plots</hi> among <hi>Floriſts,</hi> the firſt of which, in all probability, were but <note n="*" place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But afterwards there were ſome made of another faſhion, called <hi>Embroidery Faſhion,</hi> which were better contrived, and more delightful than the other, with which two ſorts, the <hi>World</hi> contented themſelves for ſeveral <hi>Ages,</hi> ſo that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> were not accompanied with any other Beauties than thoſe, till in theſe laſt times, <hi>Curioſity, Good Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> and <hi>Magnificence</hi> it ſelf being grown by little and little, to an extraordinary heighth, our <hi>Age</hi> which excells in all that Humane induſtry is able to invent, has given in particular, by the ingenious skill of the famous Mr. <hi>Le Noſtre,</hi> the laſt perfection to this part of <hi>Gardening,</hi> which appears by ſo many <hi>Canals, Water-Works, Caſcades, Spouting Fountains, Labyrinths, Bowling Greens, Terraſes,</hi> &amp;c. Ornaments indeed that are new, but ſuch as in earneſt, do wonderfully ſet off the natural Beauty of a <hi>Garden.</hi>

            <p>Having ſpoken largely enough of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Claſs</hi> of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Market <hi>or</hi> Marſh <hi>or</hi> Kitchin-Gard'ners.</note> I proceed to the third, which is of thoſe which meddle neither with <hi>Fruits</hi> nor <hi>Flowers,</hi> but only with <hi>Kitchin-plants,</hi> whoſe Original might come from ſome of our firſt <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who being ſeated near ſome very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Cities,</hi> thought good to plant ſome particular <hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>Herbs,</hi> in hopes they might make a conſiderable gain of them in the publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and becauſe Grounds that were a little fat and moiſt ſeemed to them moſt proper, as well for the managing the <hi>Culture,</hi> as promoting the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and bigneſs, and height of every Plant, they choſe low places to make thoſe kinds of <hi>Gardens</hi> in; nay, and perhaps ſuch places had been
<pb facs="tcp:48210:4"/>
formerly perfect Fenns or Marſhes, which were afterwards drained and laid dry, ſo that in Vulgar Speech, thoſe ſorts of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> were termed <hi>Marſh Gard'ners,</hi> which was as much as to ſay, <hi>Gard'ners</hi> of dryed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes or Fenns. And the vent of thoſe <hi>Herbs,</hi> proving by the ſucceſs ſo profitable to thoſe that made it, ſtirred up Mens Induſtry to multiply that ſort of <hi>Gardens,</hi> even in very dry and ſandy places, and to ſupply with their frequent Waterings, and improvements with plenty of Dung, the defects of goodneſs in the Ground.</p>
            <p>This Account which I here give, eſtabliſhes clearly three <hi>Claſſes</hi> of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ners</hi> very different one from the other, without mentioning the other two <hi>Claſſes,</hi> viz. that of thoſe <hi>Gard'ners</hi> that mind only <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Nurſery Gard'ners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Botaniſts.</note> other of thoſe that conſine themſelves to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Rare</hi> and <hi>Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Plants;</hi> and yet 'tis certain, there are ſome very able and knowing Perſons, that make it their Pleaſure and Buſineſs too, to cultivate both of them, and to perform it with Succeſs and Reputation.</p>
            <p>But as for my own inclination, it was always fixed to that ſort of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ning</hi> that was known in the infancy of the <hi>World,</hi> and practiſed by our firſt <hi>Parents,</hi> ſo that for a long time, I have particularly applyed my ſelf to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Kitchin Gardens.</hi> And by this Application, having not only diſcovered a great number of Beauties, but likewiſe a great many Faults that are committed in that ſort of <hi>Gardening,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think my ſelf obliged before all things, to deſcribe them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they may be avoided.</p>
            <p>I find then firſt, that commonly theſe ſorts of <hi>Gardens</hi> are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh'd with what they ſhould, and might eaſily have for each ſeaſon of the Year, whether <hi>Fruits</hi> or <hi>Legumes,</hi> but that beſides, they are ill contrived in the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>Ranking</hi> of the things contained in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That there appears but little skill and capacity in moſt of the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> that cultivate them, and as little underſtanding in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that employ them, to know how to direct them better; ſo that uſually 'tis the fault both of the Owners, and their <hi>Gard'ners</hi> too, that thoſe ſorts of <hi>Gardens</hi> come ſhort of yielding either that Pleaſure or Profit they might otherwiſe do, and which was expected from them.</p>
            <p>I will do what I can, to remedy thoſe great Failings, as well out of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Orders I have received to that effect, as out of an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to pleaſure others, an inclination which I dare affirm natural to me, and eſpecially in affairs of <hi>Gardening,</hi> which of it <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Agriculture</hi> is an Art truly noble, and capable to ennoble its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy profeſſours; moſt of which are ſo generous and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that they take an extreme Pleaſure in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole World ſee their Works; and when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen tomake any proſperous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, they have no greater, joy than to declareto ſuch as have a mind to know them; the means they uſed to ſucceed in it, whereas commonly the humour of other <hi>Artiſts</hi> is to make a <hi>Myſtery</hi> of all things, and diſingenuouſly to keep to themſelves alone, the new <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> they have made in their Art. <hi>Xenoph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> ſelf inſpires a Man with the obliging humour of doing good Offices. For which purpoſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to compoſe and publiſh this Treatiſe, as thinking it might effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be a uſeful work, if, as I believe, I may, and as I propoſe to my ſelf to do, I ſhall be ſo ſucceſsful to give any aſſiſtance to ingenious Gentlemen to order their <hi>Gardens</hi> with a more advantageous Conduct, and at the ſame time direct their <hi>Gard'ners</hi> to execute their <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Intentions better than hitherto, and conſequently by the means of a well managed <hi>Culture,</hi> how to reap thoſe advantages which the <hi>Earth</hi> beſtows only upon the Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Induſtrious. Beſides which, three other principal reaſons have obliged me to write.</p>
            <p>The firſt was the little inſtruction, I obſerved was to be gathered from ſo many Books, which have been made upon this Subject in all <hi>Ages,</hi> and in all Languages. 'Tis true, we have a great deal of Obligation, not only to ſome <note n="*" place="margin">Colum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:48210:5"/>
to the publick, their particular improvements in this Art. But we are moſt of all obliged to ſome <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Under the Title of</hi> Memoires of the Curate of Enon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</note> 
               <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Eminent Quality,</hi> who under, the title of the <hi>Memoires</hi> or <hi>Obſervations</hi> of the <hi>Famous Curate</hi> of <hi>Enonville,</hi> have ſo politely written of the <hi>Culture of Fruit-trees.</hi> And truly I muſt confeſs, it was from them I had the firſt views of the principal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our <hi>Gardens,</hi> as well as thoſe of the Pleaſure and Advantage we reap from ſuch of them as are well managed. But then to balance theſe few good Authors, what a multitude of other Books have we to exclaim againſt, with which we are overwhelmed? The moſt part of which, I may without injuſtice affirm, are not to be lookt upon otherwiſe than as troubleſom <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and nauſeous <hi>Repetitions</hi> of ſeveral old <hi>Maxims,</hi> which I hope, I ſhall carefully mark out to you, and demonſtrate at the ſame time to be for the moſt part <hi>faulty,</hi> or at leaſt very <hi>inſigniſicant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon that obliges me to write, is the aſſurance I have, that I am the Cauſe of peoples acting erroneouſly in many <hi>Gardens,</hi> though it be the moſt innocently in the World on my ſide, which proceeds from the inconſiderate conduct of certain Perſons that being prejudiced with too favourable a conceit of my Abilities in this kind, when they ſee what I do in our <hi>Kitchin Gardens,</hi> and to our <hi>Fruit-trees,</hi> are ſometimes tempted blindly to imitate my <hi>Practice;</hi> but becauſe they are ignorant of my <hi>Principles,</hi> and think it would reflect too much upon their Reputation, to ſtoop ſo low as to ask me them, they venture to gueſs at them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thinking without doubt that nothing is ſo eaſie as to hit them right.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear telling them, and I deſire them not totake it ill, that 'tis a very rare thing to gueſs right inalmoſt any ſort of matter whatſoever; and though it be true, that this of our <hi>Art</hi> is not at all difficult to underſtand when 'tis illuſtrated and made out with good Reaſons, yet moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people are not very lucky in hitting upon them at a venture, without ſome inſtruction; for alas, by following their firſt imaginations, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten run the hazard of acting juſt the contrary to what I practiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to what they deſign, when they think of nothing but gueſſing.</p>
            <p>For Example, in matter of Pruning, one Gentleman, becauſe he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome ſhort Branches upon my Trees, ſays preſently, he ſees well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that my way of <hi>pruning</hi> is to cut ſhort, and keeps to that. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he has ſeen ſome long ones upon them, concludes as peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily on his Side, that my method is to cut long, and that he fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it. Laſtly, a third, becauſe he has once obſerved me at the ſame time, to cut ſome Branches ſhort, and others long; if another time he returns and ſees any Trees with a different Face from what he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preſently accuſes me of uncertainty in my <hi>Principles;</hi> nay, and takes the liberty to ſay, he ſees much inconſtancy in my <hi>pruning,</hi> and therefore, that I have no certain Rule to go by in that <hi>Operation,</hi> and thereupon as he fanſies, makes the fineſt reflections in the World, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take for the future a quite diſſerent way from mine.</p>
            <p>The firſt being one of that ſort of haſty Spirits, that think they can comprehend any thing at firſt ſight, makes, as I may ſay, great Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres upon the Trees, whilſt thinking to imitate my manner of pruning, he takes a Reſolution to cut cloſe in all occaſions.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, with the like Intention, ruines in little time the Beauty of his Trees, by leaving thoſe Branches long, which ſhould be cut ſhort.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the third ſalls into ſuch a perplexity, that he knows not which way to take.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Gulſs into which the falſe Reaſonings from bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectures and probabilities lead and decoy Men. And therefore though I
<pb facs="tcp:48210:5"/>
ſhould do nothing elſe in this Book, but give an account of my Conduct, by explaining for Example, what ſort of Branches I cut ſhort, and what I leave long; what Trees I leave loaden with more Branches, and which with fewer, &amp;c. with the motives why I do ſo, I think it would be no ſmall benefit to the Publick, that they who ſhall be thus informed of them, may not torment their Heads ſo much any more with gueſſing, nor conſequently be ſo eaſily induced to venture upon erroneous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>This done, if my Conduct be approved it will be imitated, at which I ſhall be extreamly ſatisfied, becauſe of the intereſt I have, that every one ſhould be pleaſed; and if it be not liked, it will be condemned, and perhaps may incite ſome charitable cenſurer to publiſh a better, at which I ſhall be no leſs pleaſed, becauſe of the paſſionate deſire I have to improve my ſelf to more and more perfection in this matter.</p>
            <p>In fine, the third and laſt reaſon that obliges me to write, is the hopes I have, that the reading of this Book will be advantageous in two other Reſpects, of which I think I ought to make ſome account.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That every one of my <hi>Maxims</hi> being fully underſtood in their whole extent, as I intend they ſhould, and as they may be, by what I have written to explain them, will, if I miſtake not, give ſome light to direct people to take better methods in <hi>Gardening.</hi> But if through Malice or Ignorance, any Perſon ſhall follow one part of any of my <hi>Rules,</hi> without obſerving the other, I am confident he will find himſelf very much deceived, and therefore do here ſincerely advertiſe all concerned, to obſerve that Caution, that I may not be reſponſible for all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences they will infallibly fall into, as often as they ſhall ſcruple en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to believe me.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, becauſe moſt of thoſe unskilſul <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> as have ſeen only with a Curſory view what I do, or perhaps have only heard of it by the Relation of others, if they ſucceed ill, as it but too often happens, they preſently have an excuſe ready, and without ſcruple diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Faults, by throwing them on <hi>me;</hi> they make <hi>me</hi> the Author of all their miſ-managements, thinking to Authorize by my Name what they cannot otherwiſe defend; they will needs have me to have brought in ſuch and ſuch a uſe, which never entred intomy thoughts, and ſay they have done ſuch and ſuch things, purpoſely to imitate <hi>me,</hi> and to let the World ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſo much reaſon to imitate <hi>me,</hi> as is pretended. Againſt theſe Pleas, I ſhall now at leaſt have an irrefragable juſtification in Writing, ſo that it being in no Man's power to pretend I have ſaid any thing but what I have really ſaid, I ſhall by this means prevent ſuch imputations for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and perhaps <note n="*" place="margin">As it is a thing of great uſe, to work skilfully in <hi>Agriculture,</hi> ſo it is much more pernicious to do any thing in it ill, than to do nothing at all. <hi>Xencplion.

            <p>I hazard then to publiſh this Inſtruction for <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> principally with a deſign to pleaſure ingenious Gentlemen, and alſo becauſe I can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with Patience endure, that to the ſhame of our Times, and if I may be permitted that Expreſſion, to the ſhame of all that cloſe Application I have beſtowed upon this <hi>Art</hi> for theſe many Years; it ſhould be poſſible ſtill with juſtice to ſay of <hi>ours,</hi> what <hi>Columella</hi> reproached to his <hi>Age,</hi> That though the knowledge of <hi>Agriculture</hi> be one of the moſt excellent Sciences, and the moſt akin to ſolid Wiſdom of any, yet is it ſo unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected as to ſind but few Maſters able to teach it, or Scholars deſirous to learn it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:6"/>
I know well enough, that all Books of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> have uſually begun with a Preface full of the praiſes given to it, and that conſcquently it may be thought, this ought to begin ſo too. But ſince I am far from preſuming my ſelf able to ſay any thing new, that may at all enhance the eſteem which is due to <hi>Gardens,</hi> or to the <hi>Art</hi> that teaches their Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore cannot but think it very impertinent to go about to perſuade any one to ſtudy it; when I obſerve the moſt part of Men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with a natural paſſion for ſo ſweet and profitable an Occupation, I ſhall wave thoſe Complements, and fall down-right upon the purſuit of my Deſign, which is to inſtruct, in caſe I can ſhow my ſelf really maſter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the <hi>Art,</hi> worthily to perform it.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe therefore, as I have ſaid, is chiefly intended for two ſorts of Perſons. Firſt, for thoſe illuſtrious Gard'ners (for ſo it is, for want of more particular and ſignificant Terms, I will hence forward ſtile the <note place="margin">

            <p>I will aſſiſt the firſt, that is, the illuſtrious <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> how to find and attain caſily the true divertiſements of <hi>Gardens.</hi> And the others I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inſtruct, and render fit and capable, artfully to perform all the Duties of their Calling and Quality. My deſign appears very great, and very ſpecious, and therefore muſt be managed with ſome Order. That which I purpoſe to follow, is this.</p>
            <p>I will divide the Work into ſix parts, every one of which I ſhall make <note place="margin">The Diviſion of the following Work. The ſubſtance of the firſt part.</note> a particular Book.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin the firſt by proving as well as I can, that a man had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never have any <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Kitchin Gardens</hi> at all, than not to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably well inſtructed in the management of them; and at the ſame time I will ſhew, that 'tis very eaſie to acquire a general and ſufficient Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in it, there being nothing elſe needful to be done for that, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to read, and order to be exactly obſerved, a little abridgment of the Rules of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> which I have drawn up by way of <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> in the third Chapter of the firſt Book.</p>
            <p>And afterwards in the ſame firſt Part, I will, if my Judgment deceive me not, give directions how to make a diſcreet choice of able <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> which I reckon to be one of the moſt important points to be lookt after in this matter. And laſtly to prevent any doubts or perplexities, our Gentlemen <hi>Candidates,</hi> or young beginners in theſe <hi>Curioſities</hi> may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for want of a right underſtanding of certain Terms of <hi>Gardening,</hi> which I ſhall uſe in this Treatiſe, I have added a little <hi>Dictionary</hi> of them at the end, which gives as full an explanation of them, as is neceſſary to make them intelligible to the meaneſt Readers.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond part, I ſhall firſt ſhew what Qualities are neceſſary to make any piece of Ground fit to be converted into a <hi>Garden,</hi> that may <note place="margin">The ſubſtance of the ſecond part.</note> be both profitable and delightful. Next I ſhall direct what is to be done in order to the right preparation of thoſe Grounds, that are naturally pretty good, and the melioration and improvement of thoſe which are not ſo; and how to model any Fruit or <hi>Kitchin Garden</hi> whatſoever, great or little, regular or irregular, well or ill ſituated, as well for the moſt advantageous diſpoſing of its <hi>encloſure,</hi> and well garniſhing its <hi>Walls,</hi> as of the <hi>Ground</hi> in the middle, that the whole may be ſo well imployed, that it may not only court our <hi>Senſes</hi> with the Charms of <hi>Neatneſs</hi> and <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but be rendred more eaſie and convenient to <hi>Cultivate,</hi> and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant and good natur'd, as above all, to reward our Labours with a
<pb facs="tcp:48210:6"/>
competent ſtore not only of all ſorts of <hi>Legumes,</hi> but particularly of choice, good and lovely <hi>Fruits.</hi> And laſtly, I will lay down inſtructions how to cultivate <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> throughout the whole Year, and how to recruit them with freſh <hi>Amendments,</hi> as often as they ſhall need it.</p>
            <p>In the Third Part, I will endeavour to deſcribe which are in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <note place="margin">The Subſtance of the third part.</note> the choiceſt ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> that Gentlemen may not only be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by induced to chuſe none but them, but may be directed how to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the number of each of them in every <hi>Garden,</hi> and becauſe 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know only in general, which are the principal ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I ſhall alſo ſpecifie in particular which are the beſt in every Month, how long each ſort of them uſually laſt, and as near as can well be calculated, what quantity of <hi>Fruit</hi> each <hi>Tree</hi> may be expected to yield at its firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to bear, after three, four, five, or ſix years planting, when it is well ordered, that Gentlemen may take their meaſures accordingly, ſo as to be furniſht with ſuch a ſtore of them, that may be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the paſſion they may have for <hi>Fruit.</hi> I will likewiſe give Directions at the ſame time, how to aſſign each <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> the place that is moſt proper and effectual to make it thrive and proſper. And, Secondly, how to chuſe ſuch well qualified <hi>Stocks</hi> of every ſort of Tree, as may truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a place in a <hi>Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, how to prepare them by trimming both their <hi>Tops</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> in order to plant them; and, Laſtly, how to plant them well; all which are Obſervations ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that without them, 'tis impoſſible not to commit very great errours.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Part, I will treat of the <hi>pruning,</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> according to the <note place="margin">The Subſtànce of the fourth part.</note> method practiſed by my Self; and afterwards I will deſcribe my way of <hi>pinching ſome of them,</hi> and of <hi>disbudding</hi> or <hi>thinning their Leaves, nailing them up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Part, I will direct how to thin them of their <hi>Fruit,</hi> by plucking off as many as occaſion ſhall require, where they grow too thick, for we are not to leave ſo many <hi>Fruit</hi> upon a <hi>Tree,</hi> as it had Bloſſoms, but have reaſon rather to be ſuſpicious of thoſe that bloſſom too much, the exceſs of their good Will, if I may ſo ſay, being to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a great Fault, becauſe it moſt certainly diſables them from bringing their products to perfection.</p>
            <p>I ſhall alſo give inſtructions when 'twill be proper to uncover ſuch <hi>Fruit</hi> as we ſhall have left growing, in order to their attaining that beauty of colour, and accompliſht goodneſs which are agreeable to their kind; as alſo, exactly when to gather both thoſe which ripen on the <hi>Tree,</hi> and thoſe which attain not their full ripeneſs there, but muſt be laid up to mellow in the Houſe. Alſo,</p>
            <p>How to keep them as long as 'tis poſſible, for which purpoſe, I ſhall give all neceſſary Directions for the Building, Expoſition, and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Store-houſes</hi> for <hi>Fruit.</hi> And, Laſtly, I ſhall direct how to know when any ſort of <hi>Fruit</hi> is ripe, and when it may ſeaſonably be ſerved up to be eaten, whether it be ſuch as will not keep, ſuch as are all <hi>Summer-Fruits,</hi> or ſuch as is laid up in the <hi>Store-houſe</hi> to be kept, of which <hi>Claſs,</hi> are <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter Fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame fifth part, I intend likewiſe to treat of ſome Diſeaſes of <hi>Trees</hi> that may be cured, where I ſhall ingenuouſly declare at the ſame time, which are thoſe againſt which I have been able yet to find no Remedy: Alſo to reſtore thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> to their former vigour which are fallen into a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition, for want of good <hi>Culture.</hi> And, Laſtly, to lay down In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, how to diſtinguiſh thoſe which are paſt recovery, that ſo no Perſon may be at any further expence of time, or Pains or Money upon

them, to no purpoſe. I likewiſe pretend in the ſame fifth part, to give all the inſight that is needful for the management of <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> as well in reſpect to the choice of <hi>Stocks</hi> moſt proper to receive <hi>Grafts</hi> of what kind ſoever, as to the <hi>Grafting</hi> them in ſuch a manner, as may be moſt agreeable both to each ſort of <hi>Fruit</hi> to be Grafted, and to each <hi>Stock</hi> to be Grafted on. I ſhall therefore alſo give my advice about the different ways of <hi>Trelliſſing</hi> and <hi>Nailing</hi> up <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, in the ſixth part, I intend to treat of <hi>Kitchin-Gardens;</hi> which is a ſubject of no leſs vaſt extent than profit, when it falls into the hands of Perſons that underſtand, and manage it aright. I ſhall therefore Treat of it ſomewhat Largely; with deſign to ſhew,</p>
            <p>Firſt, what may profitably enter into all ſorts of <hi>Kitchin-Gardens,</hi> ſo compleatly to ſtock them that it may be ſaid, there's nothing wanting in them, to which I ſhall add a Deſcription of all ſeeds and other things, by which each particular ſort of plant is produced and multiplyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſpecifie what products and proviſions, a <hi>Kitchin-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſhould furniſh us with every Month of the <hi>Tear,</hi> and what ſhould be the work of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> in every one of thoſe Months, and ſhew how to do them well; and laſtly, what ſhould be found in every <hi>Kitchin-Garden,</hi> at all ſeaſons, to convince us it is in a good Condition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what ſort of <hi>Ground</hi> is moſt proper for every particular ſort of Plant, to bring it to its due perfection, and more eſpecially which is the beſt way to make all ſorts of <hi>Legumes</hi> turn to account, and anſwer expectation, whether they be ſuch as are ſown not to be removed, or ſuch as muſt neceſſarily be tranſplanted, or laſtly, ſuch as are propagated without ſowing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, how long each of them occupies its place, as well before it arrives to its due perfection, as whilſt it continues bearing. I will alſo ſpecifie at the ſame time, what plants muſt be houſed up in the <hi>Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> for our <hi>Winter Proviſions,</hi> and what by the help of Art and Induſtry, may be produced inſpite of the ſroſt.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, I ſhall Teach how to raiſe all ſort of ſeeds, for the more eaſie maintainance of our <hi>Kitchin-Garden</hi> in full ſtock, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how long time each ſort will keep good, they having not all the ſame deſtiny in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>And a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> that could but underſtand, what I have juſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the aboveſaid, would in all likewiſe be as fit as could be deſired, for an ordinary <hi>Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, in my opinion, it would be further needful for him to have ſome little underſtanding, in the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which, as we have above remarked, are indeed properly <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> though very often they are not ſo much conſidered for their <hi>Fruit,</hi> as for the <hi>Flowers</hi> expected from them; neither is that <hi>Culture</hi> any thing nigh ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as has been hitherto imagined. And likewiſe without any deſign, to encroach too much upon ſo many skilful <hi>Artiſts,</hi> whoſe peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it is, to deal in all thoſe Beauteous plants, that Compoſe the rich enamellings of <hi>Parterres,</hi> and <hi>Flower Plots,</hi> I may venture to put in a word or two, concerning the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Jeſſimins,</hi> and moſt of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Flowers,</hi> which may be had every Month in the <hi>Tear,</hi> which I ſhall do whilſt I am treating of the products and proviſions of each Month, in the ſame Sixth part. And it is certain, we may have ſome few <hi>Flowers</hi> in moſt <hi>Gardens</hi> of any reaſonable bigneſs, and have them betimes too, witneſs that famous <hi>Gard'ner</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">Primui vere Roſem, at<expan>

As for example, methinks 'tis very material, to know in ſome competent meaſure, the beginning and order of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:8"/>
to know what the <hi>Sap</hi> does both in the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it abounds more or leſs in each of them, whether ſtrong or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; to know what <hi>Branches</hi> are beſt diſpoſed for bearing of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and which for producing of <hi>Wood;</hi> to know the reaſons of <hi>Tillage,</hi> and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, and ſeveral other things no leſs uſeful than thoſe. Becauſe without knowing ſuch points as theſe, we could eſtabliſh no certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>pruning</hi> either <hi>Roots</hi> or <hi>Branches;</hi> of making <hi>Trees</hi> flouriſh, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing them into a Condition to be able to bear fine <hi>Fruit;</hi> of making all ſorts of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> vigorous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the things I think moſt particularly neceſſary to be known.</p>
            <p>And accordingly 'tis in the deciſion of theſe ſorts of difficulties that I have endeavoured to reaſon with the greateſt evidence I could, the better to confirm the Inſtructions I give, and which I found only upon very frequent, very long and very exact obſervations made by my own ſelf in all the parts of <hi>Gardening,</hi> without taking any thing upon truſt, upon the report of any other Perſon. So that here I communicate to the World all the light I have acquired in this ſort of <hi>Agriculture:</hi> and in ſo doing, I give an account of all I have obſerved <hi>Nature</hi> to do in the production of <hi>Vegetables.</hi> And I give this account not only without any reſerve, but ſincerely and faithfully, and according to the beſt of my ſlender Skill and Capacity. I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd my ſelf in the plaineſt manner I poſſibly could, as being well enough convinced, that this kind of matter, requires no lofty or ſwelling ſtyle, <note place="margin">Ornari res ipſa negat, contenta doceri. <hi>Horace.</hi>
               </note> and needs no greater ornament than to be ſet in a clear light, and to be well explained, and well underſtood.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here add, That the third Part of this Work, where I treat of the choice and proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> was that which coſt me the greateſt pains of any, and that which, if I miſtake not, will prove one of the moſt uſeful. My undertaking therein is as <hi>Great</hi> as <hi>New;</hi> that which makes me call it <hi>New,</hi> is becauſe that hitherto I never knew any Body that ever projected the like: And that which induces me to call it <hi>Great,</hi> is the great variety of matter, which I am to treat of in it; which though it be common and ordinary, yet is little underſtood, and conſequently gives a great deal of trouble to moſt <hi>adventurers</hi> in theſe <hi>Curioſities.</hi> Thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the choice of the beſt <hi>Fruits,</hi> that proportion of number to be obſerved of <hi>Trees</hi> of every kind, according to the bigneſs of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> and the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Ground. Thoſe Rules for the <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Diſtances,</hi> &amp;c. which I there lay down, are all matters of very great importance in Gard'ning; of which therefore 'tis ſo highly neceſſary to be well informed, that 'twill be otherwiſe impracticable, to plant with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But what I find moſt troubleſome in this attempt, is, that 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform it in few Words: ſo that to manage it with the conduct it requires, I find my ſelf obliged to make a large diſcuſſion, and under an indiſpenſible neceſſity to promiſe a Preface too, both ſomewhat long, and perhaps altogether tedious, both to my ſelf, and to thoſe for whoſe Service I make it. So that though I ſhould not otherwiſe have misfortune enough by giving occaſion to ſome curious Gentlemen to quarrel with me, for the judgment I ſhall give of every particular ſort of Fruit, whether I ſhould care or not for their exceptions; yet the frightful number of difficulties I muſt expect to meet with in the Execution of a Deſign of ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, might be alone ſufficient to make me loſe Courage, and indeed had almoſt actually prevail'd with me to deſiſt, not only while I was but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, but after I had made a conſiderable Progreſs in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:8"/>
However being perſwaded on one ſide, that my Work would have been much leſs uſeful than I intended it ſhould, if this part had been wanting to it, and on the other hand, being extremely zealous to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and no leſs averſe from the leaſt inclination to offend any body, I took courage to purſue my project, in good hopes, that at leaſt a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of thoſe <hi>Admirers of Fruit and Fruit-Trees,</hi> and which are the only Perſons, which I value in this matter, and for whom I deſigned it, will kindly accept a work which ſo much ſhortens their way; And if there happen to be any among them that may think they have reaſon to find fault with my palate, becauſe they will not always find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their own, I have reaſon to believe they will do it without any diſpleaſure at me, or railing at my innocent deſign, ſince I pretend not to confine, or blame any man in point of <hi>Taſte.</hi> No, I know well enough, that by the order of <hi>Nature,</hi> every Man is <hi>Soveraign Judge</hi> of his own cauſe in that Queſtion, as well as I, ſo that as we ſay commonly, Peoples <hi>Taſtes</hi> are not to be diſputed.</p>
            <p>This being ſuppoſed, I ſhall need only to follow the reſolution I have taken, to uſe all imaginable precautions, to keep as near to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance in all the parts of this Treatiſe of <hi>Gardening,</hi> as I ſhall be able, acting however all along according to this principle, That <hi>Doctrinal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> are not to be managed like Works of <hi>Eloquence;</hi> for in theſe latter indeed, <note n="*" place="margin">Nonnulla Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquenda Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori, quae ſuo Marte colligat. <hi>Deme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Conſideration neceſſarily engages me to give very long, and very particular accounts of things, for which exactneſs, I demand before hand ſome Indulgence, not doubting but to moſt Readers, it may ſeem too great; but I have likewiſe no leſs reaſon to believe, that if it were leſs, it would be attended by many much more offenſive faults of another kind.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the length of this Treatiſe diſguſts any Perſons from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, in all likely-hood 'twill be ſuch as are wholly taken up with greater buſineſſes than this, at which I am very well ſatisfied, it being only intended for People not otherwiſe employed, and for hours of Recreation: At leaſt they who will pleaſe to take the pains to examine my conduct, will ſee for my Iuſtification, that, as I have already ſaid, I have not pretended any thing elſe, but only to declare my opinion, upon the ſubject I treat of in that Third part.</p>
            <p>And if any Gentlemen be content to follow my Judgment, without entring into any diſcuſſion of the Reaſons which I make uſe of to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, they may let alone, not only my <hi>Preliminary Diſcourſe,</hi> and my particular <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> but likewiſe the <hi>deſcriptions</hi> I have made of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Fruits;</hi> and ſo may go ſtrait to the places where I conclude, what I really think is to be done, in order to plant wiſely and happily, (which is noted all along in the margent, and more eſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:48210:9"/>
in the Abridgment I have added at the end of the Treatiſe) for there 'tis, they will immediately find all the aſſiſtance they ſuppoſe they need, and for which they are willing to be obliged to me.</p>
            <p>That which moves me to undertake a thing in my opinion, ſo uſeful and Commodious, is, becauſe when I ſee many <hi>Gardens</hi> of all ſorts of Sizes, as it has often hapned, and daily happens to me, I ſee indeed ſome <hi>Fruit</hi> there, but withal at the ſame time, I ſee there the three greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to be feared in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that hardly any ſorts of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are well known, (which is no very hopeful ſign of their Goodneſs) are to be ſeen there, and which is moſt of all to be found fault with, the <hi>Good</hi> ones are more ſcarce there than the <hi>Bad</hi> ones: As for Example, to inſtance in <hi>Pears,</hi> which of all <hi>Fruits</hi> is that of which men plant moſt, we ſhall commonly find in <hi>Gardens,</hi> more trees of <hi>Catillacs, Orange Pears, Beſideri's, White But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pears, Jargonells, Summer Boncretiens,</hi> &amp;c. Than of <hi>Bergamots, Virgoulees, Leſchaſſeries, Ambrets, Thorn Pears, Ruſſelets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Incommodity is, that, if two or three kinds happen to be there that are truly <hi>Good,</hi> they will be there almoſt all alone, and that pretty often under different Names. For inſtance, we ſhall find a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> planted almoſt all with <hi>Winter Boncretiens, Butter Pears, Meſſire Johns,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe almoſt all only with <hi>Virgoulees, Ruſſelets, Verte Longues,</hi> or <hi>Long Green Pears,</hi> &amp;c. without a happy mixture of the one with the other.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the third and moſt conſiderable Inconvenience is, that we ſeldom ſee in any <hi>Gardens,</hi> a ſucceſſion of <hi>Fruits</hi> ſo judiciouſly contrived, that without any diſcontinuation, we may expect a perpetual ſupply of them in <hi>Summer, Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> which yet with due regard had to the Quality of their Ground, might eaſily be effected; they may perhaps boaſt, they have a ſufficiency or perhaps too much, either in one of the three <hi>Seaſons,</hi> or during ſome part of each of them, as for Inſtance, that they have ſome <hi>Blanquets</hi> or <hi>Ruſſelets</hi> for <hi>Summer,</hi> ſome <hi>Butter Pears</hi> and <hi>Bergamots,</hi> for <hi>Autumn,</hi> and ſome <hi>Boncretiens</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulees,</hi> for <hi>Winter,</hi> &amp;c. But perhaps, they have ſew other <hi>Fruits,</hi> or perhaps none at all, to furniſh ſucceſſively every <hi>Seaſon</hi> ſo long as it laſts, and much leſs to furniſh all the whole three <hi>Seaſons,</hi> one after another, without intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe are doubtleſs all very unpleaſing <hi>Irregularities,</hi> and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the want of due skill in contrivance, whilſt a <hi>Garden</hi> is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for at that time, Gentlemen commonly begin firſt with telling <note place="margin">Dimidium fact i qui benè coepit, habet. <hi>Ovid.</hi> A works half done that's well begun.</note> their deſign to ſome friends, either to demand their advice, (which is good, if they be perſons Skill'd in <hi>Gardening)</hi> or elſe chiefly to excite their Liberality, if they have any trees to give away, which uſually produces, as one may ſay, rather an <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> or confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> than a <hi>Regular Garden;</hi> And if they have not skilful acquaintance to conſult, they ſend, or perhaps go themſelves to the <hi>Nurſery Gardens,</hi> which are ordinarily very ill contrived; they name ſome few ſorts of <hi>Fruits</hi> they intend to plant, and for all the reſt only ſignifie in general, what number of trees they would have, without being able to name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the particular ſorts they have occaſion for, and much leſs to ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what numbers they want of each. And indeed 'tis becauſe they are perſwaded, there is no better way to be taken, conſidering that (if I may have leave to uſe thoſe new Terms) there are almoſt no able <hi>Frugis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults,</hi> or <hi>Fruit Sages,</hi> nor any good Books of this <hi>Frugis prudence,</hi> or <hi>Science of Fruit Culture,</hi> from which they may furniſh themſelves with the neceſſary inſtructions for the contriving of a well modelled <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:9"/>
and therefore they leave all to the Diſcretion of ſome Plant-Merchant, who perhaps on one ſide, is not very knowing, nor over well ſtockt, though at firſt he endeavours to perſwade his Cuſtomers, that he has all ſorts of good <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> as he would prove by the Teſtimony of ſome old confuſed <hi>Catalogue</hi> he fails not to ſhew them, and on the other ſide, is above all things deſirous, to take advantage of the occaſion preſented him, to put off his ware, becauſe he is aſſured, it will not keep long good.</p>
            <p>So that our new <hi>Curious adventurer</hi> is forced to plant ſuch Trees as either his <hi>Friends</hi> have given him, or as the <hi>Plant-Merchant</hi> has ſold him, whether they be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad,</hi> and ſo provided the number he deſired, be compleated, he reſts ſatisfied and contented, and quietly lets paſs the firſt four, or five, or ſix years in expectation, till every Tree may ſhew what it is able to perform: And he finds here and there one perhaps, that bears <hi>Fruit,</hi> to amuſe the Maſter's. hopes for ſome while, but at laſt, time ſhews him a true, but too late a ſight of the errours into which he was unhappily fallen.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Trees are now grown tall how ill ſatisfied ſoever a man may be at the <hi>Fruit</hi> they produce, he can hardly find in his heart to reſolve upon new grafting them, and much leſs upon beginning a new <hi>Plantation,</hi> ſo much afraid are people of engaging in any attempt to correct their firſt miſtakes, that is attended with the hazard of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new ones equally pernicious; and by that means they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves plunged in the mire, and are ſo diſpirited as to remain in it, vexing in the mean while, to ſee themſelves deceived of the hopes they had conceived of their beloved project; which produces that Diſguſt which we obſerve ſo commonly, to ſieze ſome men, and make them, though at firſt they appeared paſſionately inamoured with their <hi>Gardens,</hi> ſeek in a few years after, to get rid of them at any rate.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe two other faults that are very common: The firſt is that for want of knowing the reaſonable diſtances that are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between Trees, with reſpect to the goodneſs of the <hi>Ground,</hi> the height of the <hi>Walls,</hi> and the quality of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Fruits;</hi> They are oſten planted either too nigh to, or too far off one from the other; The ſecond is, that likewiſe for want of duly underſtanding what <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> agree beſt with each ſort of Tree, a conſiderable number of them are often unluckily planted in <hi>unkindly Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it poſſible for a man animated with ſo warm a Zeal for <hi>Gard'ning</hi> as I am, not to be ſenſibly touch'd at all theſe misfortunes, and not to <note place="margin">Ignaroſ<expan>

No, certainly, and therefore, as far as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I can, I will endeavour to prevent all thoſe faults, and to lay down directions, how to plant with ſo much circumſpection for the future, that if a Gentleman has a <hi>Garden</hi> big enough to receive any reaſonable number of Trees, he may have in it all the principal ſorts of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are to be had, for every <hi>Seaſon</hi> of the year.</p>
            <p>This reaſon that concerns the contriving of a continual ſucceſſive ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of <hi>Fruits</hi> throughout all the <hi>Seaſons;</hi> may prevail with me ſometimes in <hi>Plantations,</hi> to preferr a meaner <hi>Fruit</hi> before a better, and that becauſe the better comes in, in a time when I may have a ſufficient proviſion of other admirable ſorts beſides, and the meaner one comes in a ſeaſon, when the ſcarcity of the moſt excellent <hi>Fruits</hi> being very great, we think our ſelves very happy, if we can be ſupplied at leaſt with ſome of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling goodneſs: And accordingly for inſtance, if I had but little room for
<pb facs="tcp:48210:10"/>
               <hi>Dwarf Pear-Trees,</hi> I would plant ſometimes a <hi>Dry Martin,</hi> or a <hi>Bugi</hi> which are pretty good <hi>Winter Pears,</hi> before a <hi>Robine,</hi> or a <hi>Musked Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Boncretien,</hi> &amp;c. which are <hi>Summer Fruits</hi> much better in themſelves than the two precedent ones. I ſhall afterwards ſhew what Reaſons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to follow this Method.</p>
            <p>They which, as I may without vanity, ſay, know not ſo much in this matter as I do, may perhaps be ſurpriſed at ſuch a choice, which without the knowledge of the particular circumſtances that influenced me to make it, would appear ſomewhat odd, but I dare aſſure them, they will not find it not very eaſie to cenſure my <hi>Conduct,</hi> if they will but allow themſelves time to examine my <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe if a Gentleman, were never ſo well Experienced in the Knowledge of the good ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> he would be never the further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, if it were very difficult, or perhaps Impoſſible, to find them in the <hi>Nurſery Gardens,</hi> this is the Anſwer I make to ſo Important a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>I Hope my exactneſs in the <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> of <hi>Fruits</hi> I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, will produce a <hi>Regulation</hi> and kind of <hi>Reformation</hi> in all <hi>Nurſery Gardens;</hi> I mean, that it will not only baniſh all confuſion, and effects of unskilfullneſs out of them that have been ill contrived, but will cauſe new ones to be modelled with all poſſible <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>underſtanding;</hi> And then it will happen, that inſtead of grafting any more either of thoſe kinds I reject by name, or of thoſe I name not, that both of them will grow ſo much out of requeſt, that they will be but loſt to the <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> and conſequently they will be obliged for their own intereſt, to graft on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe which I expreſs ſome eſteem for; whether they be new or Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kinds, and none at all of the others, and fewer of thoſe of which few are to be planted, and more of thoſe of which I adviſe to plant the greateſt number; by which means, the able <hi>Plant-Merchants</hi> may be aſſured of a good and never-failing vent for their <hi>Goods</hi> on one ſide, which may encourage them to do better and better, and on the other, all <hi>Gardens</hi> will inſenſibly come to be eſtabliſhed upon a perfect <hi>Model,</hi> which is the main thing aimed at for the pleaſure and ſatisfaction of all our <hi>Curious</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, till <hi>Nurſeries</hi> can be brought into that ſtate of <hi>Perfection</hi> I have propoſed, ſo that we may one day enjoy the convenience, to find in them a ſufficient ſtore of all ſorts of good Trees, we may have occaſion for, now Gentlemen are informed by the choice I have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Treatiſe, which are the <hi>Prime Fruits</hi> of every <hi>Seaſon,</hi> if they happen, among a great number of other <hi>Fruits</hi> which are <hi>rejected,</hi> to find but a part of thoſe that are <hi>Prized,</hi> they will do well to take rather more of them than they firſt intended, than to venture to meddle with any of the worſer kinds. And in doing this, their beſt way will be, to obſerve theſe two reſolutions, Firſt, either to plant no Trees but of thoſe few <hi>Good ſorts</hi> which they have found, and to fill up all the places they have to fill, wholly with them, or elſe to ſtay till another year, to gain time to look for thoſe ſorts they could not find the laſt, rather than to hazard the planting of any <hi>unknown</hi> or <hi>doubtful</hi> kinds.</p>
            <p>And perhaps, as it is very expedient they ſhould, they will have ſo much wiſe forecaſt of themſelves, to prepare at leaſt, in the mean while ſome Stocks to graft thoſe kinds upon the next, which they could not find the laſt year, and which I have adviſed them to plant; which they may do either upon ſome of thoſe ſupernumerary Trees they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken, or upon good <hi>Wildings,</hi> which they may plant ready in their aſſigned places, for that effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48210:10"/>
For, to conclude, in the matter of <hi>Plantations,</hi> aſſoon as ever we have reſolved to have a <hi>Fruit Garden,</hi> we muſt not forget any thing that may aſſiſt us to follow exactly <hi>Cato</hi>'s precept, which adviſes us to gain time, and to advance our <hi>Projects</hi> of <hi>Curioſities</hi> in this Nature, with all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition imaginable.

            <p>I Cannot conceive but it muſt needs be a very acceptable <hi>Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of Univerſal Concern to all Noble-men, and Perſons of Quality, lovers of Gardens, and Improvers of Plantations (of all Diverſions and Employments the moſt Natural, Uſefull, Innocent and Agreeable) at what Diſtance ſoever (from a Place of ſo eaſy and ſpeedy Correſpondence and which is ſo nere this great City) to give this Notice.</p>
            <p>That of all I have hitherto ſeen, either at Home or Abroad; or found by Reading many Books publiſh'd on this Subject, pretending to ſpeak of <hi>Nurſeries</hi> and <hi>Plantations</hi> for ſtore and variety; Directions for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning (or as they term it) the Skillful Making, Plotting, Laying-out, and diſpoſing of a Ground to the beſt Advantage: In a word, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever were deſireable for the Furniture of ſuch a Ground, with the moſt excellent, and <hi>Warantable</hi> Fruit (I ſay <hi>Warantable;</hi> becauſe it is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly due to their honneſt Induſtry, and ſo rarely to be met with elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) and other Acceſſories to Gardens of all Denominations, as in that Vaſt, and ample <hi>Collection</hi> which I have lately ſeen, and well conſider'd at <hi>Brompton Park</hi> near <hi>Kenſington:</hi> The very ſight of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, gives an <hi>Idea</hi> of ſomething that is greater than I can well expreſs, without an endumeration of Particulars; and of the exceeding Induſtry, Method and Addreſs of thoſe who have undertaken, and Cultivated it for publick Uſe: I mean Mr. <hi>George London</hi> (chief <hi>Gardner</hi> to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties) and his Aſſociate Mr. <hi>Henry Wiſe:</hi> For I have long obſerv'd (from the daily practice, and effects of the laudable Induſtry of theſe two Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) that they have not made Gain the only mark of their Pains; But with Extraordinary, and rare Induſtry, endeavour'd to improve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Myſteries of their Profeſſion, from the great Advantages, and now long Experience they have had, in being Employ'd in moſt of the celebrated Gardens and Plantations which this Nation abounds in; beſides what they have learn'd Abroad, and where <hi>Horticulture</hi> is in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reputation.</p>
            <p>I find they not only underſtand the Nature and Genius of the ſeveral Soils; but their uſual Infirmities, proper Remedies, Compoſts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to Reinvigorate exhauſted Mould; ſweeten the foul and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reduce the Sower, Harſh, Stuborn and Dry, or over moiſt and diluted Earth to its genuine Temper and Conſtitution; and what Aſpects, and Situations are proper for the ſeveral ſorts of Mural, Standard, Dwarf and other Fruite-trees.</p>
            <p>They have made Obſervations, and given me a Specimen of that long (but hitherto) wanting particular, of Diſcriminating the ſeveral kinds of Fruits, by their <hi>Characteriſtical</hi> Notes, from a long, and Critical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Leafe, Taſt, Colour,</hi> and other diſtinguiſhing Qualities: So as one ſhall not be impos'd upon with <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Several Names;</hi> when as in truth, there is but one due to them. For inſtance, in <hi>Peares</hi> alone, a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in the Country ſends to the <hi>Nuſeries</hi> for the <hi>Liver Blanch, Piguigny, de chouille, Rattau blane,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> St. <hi>Gilbert, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn Pears</hi> (and ſeveral other names) when all this while, they are no other than the well known <hi>Cadillac.</hi> The ſame alſo hap'ning in <hi>Peaches, Apples, Plums, Cherris</hi> and other <hi>Fruit;</hi> for want of an accurate exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

(by comparing of their Taſte, and thoſe other Indications I have mentioned) For which Gentlemen complain (and not without cauſe) that the <hi>Nurſery-Men</hi> abuſe them; when 'tis their Ignorance, or the <hi>Exotic</hi> Name of which they are ſo fond.</p>
            <p>I find they have likewiſe apply'd themſelves to attain a ſufficient Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> for general deſign, and expeditious Methods for caſting and leveling of Grounds; and to bring them into the moſt apt Form they are capable off; which requires a particular Addreſs, and to determine the beſt Proportions of Walks and Avenues, Starrs, Centers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuitable to the lengths; and how, and with what materials whether <hi>Gravel, Carpet,</hi> &amp;c. to be layed.</p>
            <p>They have a numerous Collection of the beſt <hi>Deſigns,</hi> and I perceive are able of themſelves to Draw, and contrive other, applicable to the places when buſie Works, and Parterrs of Imbroidery for the <hi>Coronary</hi> and <hi>Flower Gardens</hi> are proper or deſired. And where <hi>Fountaines, Statues, Vaſas, Dials,</hi> and other decorations of Magnificence are to be plac'd with moſt advantage.</p>
            <p>To this add, a plentiful, and choice Collection of <hi>Orange-trees, Lemon, Mertil, Baies, Jaſſmines,</hi> and all other Rarities, and Exotics, requiring the <hi>Conſervatory;</hi> after they have embelliſh't their proper ſtations abroad du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Summer,</hi> and for continuing a no leſs ornament in the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> during <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have a very brave and noble Aſſembly of the <hi>Flowery</hi> and other <hi>Trees; Perennial</hi> and variegated <hi>Ever-Greens</hi> and ſhrubs, hardy, and fitteſt for our <hi>Climate;</hi> and underſtand what beſt to plant the humble <hi>Boſcage, Wilderneſs,</hi> or taller <hi>Groves</hi> with: where, and how to diſpoſe, and govern them, according as Ground, and ſituation of the place requires both for ſhelter and ornament. For which purpoſe (and for Walks and Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues) they have ſtore of <hi>Elms, Limes, Platans, Conſtantinople-Cheſnuts, Black-Cherry-trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor are they, I perceive, leſs knowing in that moſt uſeful (though leſs pompous part of <hi>Horticulture)</hi> the <hi>Potagere, Meloniere, Culinarie Gardent</hi> Where they ſhould moſt properly be plac'd for the use of the Family; how to be planted, furniſh'd and Cultivated ſo as to afford great pleaſure to the Eye, as well as profit to the Maſter. And they have alſo <hi>Seeds, Bulbs, Roots, Slips,</hi> for the <hi>Flowery Garden,</hi> and ſhew how they ought to be order'd and maintain'd.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I might ſuper-add, the great number of <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> of Noble-men and Perſons of Quality, which they have made and planted <hi>ab Origine,</hi> and are ſtill under their Care and inſpection (though at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Diſtances) and how exceedingly they proſper, to juſtifie what I have freely ſaid in their behalf.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Nurſery</hi> part in Voucher, and to make good what I have ſaid on that particular, one needs no more than take a Walk to <hi>Brompton Park</hi> (upon a fair Morning) to behold, and admire what a <hi>Magazine</hi> theſe Induſtrious Men have provided, fit for age, and Choice in their ſeveral Claſſes; and all within one Incloſure: Such an Aſſembly I believe, as is no where elſe to be met with in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> nor in any other that I know of.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>How Neceſſary it is for a Gentleman, who deſigns to have <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> to be at leaſt reaſonably Inſtructed in what relates to thoſe Kind of <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THAT Part of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> I begin to treat of here, certainly affords a Gentleman who underſtands and applies himſelf to it, a great deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but that very <hi>Gard'ning</hi> being manag'd by an unskilful lazy <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> is liable to many Inconveniencies, and Vexations. Theſe are Two Noted and undeniable Truths, ſince nothing in the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more Foreſight and Activity than thoſe kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens.</hi> They are, as it were, in a perpetual Motion, which inclines them always to Act either for Good or Ill, according to the good or ill Conduct of their Maſter; and ſo largely recompence the Ingenious, as they ſeverely puniſh the Unskilful.</p>
                        <p>The Proof of my firſt Propoſition conſiſts in that certainly nothing affords more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, firſt, than to have a <hi>Garden</hi> well ſeated, of a reaſonable largeneſs, and fine Figure, and that perhaps of our own Contriving or Modelling.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Place, to have that <hi>Garden</hi> at all times not only Neat, for Walking, and to divert the Sight, but likewiſe abounding in good Things to pleaſe the Pallate, as well as for the preſervation of Health.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:48210:26"/>

                           <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48210:27"/>
Thirdly, daily to meet with ſome new Thing or other to do in it, as to <hi>Sow,</hi> to <hi>Plant,</hi> to <hi>Prune,</hi> to <hi>Palliſade,</hi> to ſee <hi>Plants</hi> grow, <hi>Legumes</hi> thrive, <hi>Trees Bloſſom; Fruit</hi> Knitting, then Thickning, Colouring, Ripening, at laſt come to Gather them, Taſte them, Treat ones Friends with them, hear their Beauty, Goodneſs and Abundance commended; all which Things together certainly form a very agreeable Idea, which affords a World of Variety.</p>
                        <p>To prove my ſecond Propoſition, I ſhould only need in few Words to Enumerate all the Diſorders, wherewith our <hi>Gard'ning</hi> is Threatned, or rather Diſhonour'd when it wants <hi>Culture;</hi> but they are too well known, nothing being ſo common as to hear Complaints of that Kind.</p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that there are both Pleaſures and Vexations in <hi>Gard'ning;</hi> and it is as certain, that the Pleaſures are reſerved for Skilful, Active Gard'ners, and the Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions infallibly for thoſe that are either Lazy or Unskilful.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, it muſt likewiſe be allowed, that thoſe are neither to be excuſed or pitied, who inſtead of improving the Advantages they expected from their <hi>Gardens,</hi> are reduced to the Miſery of laying out a great deal of Money, with Loſs, Diſguſt and cauſe of Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> While others with a little Skill have avoided all thoſe Diſorders, and enjoy all the Delights; from whence it follows, that if an Ingenious Man deſigns to have a <hi>Garden,</hi> which is a thing ſo ſuitable to that Qualification, he muſt abſolutely think of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome Skill in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> or elſe not meddle with it at all.</p>
                        <p>The grand Queſtion is to know, whether that Skill, which I think ſo neceſſary, may be acquir'd with eaſe or difficulty, now to take a juſt Medium in this Caſe.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, which is to know whether it be eaſie to acquire that Skil, I am perſuaded that many Gentlemen would be deſirous to attain it; for naturally every Body deſires it. I am likewiſe perſuaded, that the number of ſuch would have been conſiderable already, had there been ſufficient Inſtructions for it.</p>
                        <p>As to the Second Caſe, whether it be difficult to attain a ſufficient Skill, it is to be fear'd, that few of the Curious will be willing to undertake it; being diſguſted by the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſucceeding in it, after having Employ'd a great deal of Time and Labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
                        <p>The Honour of having had for ſo many Years the Direction of the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen Gardens</hi> of the Royal-Family, ſeems to give me ſome Authority to anſwer that grand Queſtion: So that, without deſigning to deceive any Body, and having a great deſire to contribute to the Satisfaction of the Ingenious, I affirm that it is very eaſie to attain as much Knowledge as is reaſonably neceſſary for the Curious, in order to avoid what might vex them, and to put them at the ſame time in a Condition to enjoy their Wiſhes.</p>
                        <p>It will be eaſie for me to prove this Aſſertion, after having Explain'd my ſelf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon what I think of all the Pleaſures that are inſeparable Companions of that part of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> now in debate.</p>
                        <p>The moſt Conſiderable of thoſe Pleaſures, is not only to be able to obtain what may <note place="margin">Ipſa ratio aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ſpe magis &amp; jucunditate, quam fructu, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que emolumento tenetur, <hi>&amp;c. Cicero.</hi>
                           </note> be produced by <hi>Earth,</hi> that ſhall have been well ordered, and a Ground well improv'd with <hi>Trees</hi> that perhaps ſhall have been <hi>Graffed, Planted, Prun'd, Cultivated, &amp;c.</hi> by our ſelves, though really the Ideas of ſuch Injoyments are powerful Charms to Engage us to the Study of them; It conſiſts in a great many other Things, as well for thoſe that will act themſelves, as for thoſe that will only act by their Advice and Orders.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Place, to know with certainty what is moſt proper to be done, in order to make each Part of the <hi>Garden</hi> produce happily and in abundance, what is deſired for every Month in the Year. The Judicious <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> as I have already obſerv'd, never fails in this, of being recompenced of his Labour, Cares and Skill. The Ground he Cultivates <note place="margin">Honeſtis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus omnia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius proveniunt, quoniam &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſius fiunt. <hi>Plinius.</hi>
                           </note> himſelf, without doubt affords him more Profuſion, being in reality better Cultivated, as if it dreaded, as I may ſay, the Misfortune of belonging to a Maſter, who only knows by his <hi>Gard'ner</hi> how it muſt be uſed. It ſeems, that to Engage that skilful Maſter it belongs to, to continue the Cultivating of it himſelf, it endeavours to produce more than it uſed to do.</p>
                        <p>This Pleaſure of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> in the ſecond Place conſiſts in knowing how to avoid many <note place="margin">In foelix ager, cujus Dominus Villicum audit, non docet. <hi>Columella.</hi>
                           </note> great uſeleſs Expences, to which we are often engaged by ill Councils. Is it not uſual in moſt Places to ſee People continually Imploy'd in doing, undoing, and doing again? And moreover is it not common to ſee a great deal of Time, and many Workmen Imploy'd about a thing that might have been done quicker, and by leſs Hands? So that a great deal of Money is laid out, which often creates great Vexations, and ſometimes great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48210:27"/>
It conſiſts in the Third Place, in knowing the Inconveniencies, that I ſhall explain in due place, of which ſome are Invincible, and others not: This knowledge ſerves to prepare us betimes to receive the firſt patiently when they happen, and ſecurely to avoid the ſecond, without entering into a thouſand impertinent reaſons of an unskilful, careleſs <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who endeavours to conceal his negligence, or incapacity, by imputing all the Diſorders, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of his <hi>Garden</hi> to a wrong cauſe.</p>
                        <p>This Pleaſure conſiſts in the Fourth Place in being able to condemn juſtly on the one ſide what is amiſs or ill done in a <hi>Garden,</hi> and on the other to commend what is well, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Rules. There is hardly any thing more natural in all Maſters who ſpeak of their <hi>Gardens,</hi> than to blame or commend ſomething in them, as if they really intended thereby to diſcover what they are; and yet nothing is more dangerous for the ſervice of a <hi>Garden,</hi> nor more diſagreeable for ſuch a Maſter than to expoſe himſelf to be laugh'd at, or corrected by his <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> which certainly happens when the Maſter is not capacitated to ſpeak like an Artiſt upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>It conſiſts in the Fifth Place in being reputed capable of giving good advice, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to thoſe who ſtand in need of it: What greater ſatisfaction can a man receive, than to aſſiſt or undeceive a friend who was in an error, or at a loſs, and ready to give over his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, putting him afterwards in a way of daily commending the good Fortune his Friend has procured him in his Work?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this Pleaſure chiefly conſiſts in being capable of judging by our ſelves, and for our ſelves, of the capacity of a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> either to avoid the Inconveniency of ſometimes diſcharging a good one upon very trivial pitiful reaſons, and then taking an ill one in his room, or to reſolve wiſely to diſcard him who has not done his duty, and be able to chuſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better qualify'd.</p>
                        <p>Now if it be true, that there is ſo much facility in attaining ſo many real Pleaſures, which I am going to demonſtrate viſibly; am I not in the right to conclude that when any body undertakes a <hi>Garden,</hi> without endeavouring to get at leaſt a ſufficient inſight in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> he deſerves all the diſguſts, which are numerous, inſtead of deſerving all the delights, it may produce, the number of which is infinite, and that conſequently it is neceſſary to ſtudy the attaining of ſuch a degree of knowledge, as is abſolutely requiſite in thoſe Affairs?</p>
                        <p>It may perhaps be objected at firſt, that hereby I propoſe an Infallible expedient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the moſt pernicious thing in nature in all manner of affairs, that is, to introduce Scioliſts, or Smatterers: The Objections ſeems pretty ſtrong, but the two Anſwers I am going to make to it, in my opinion, are yet of much more force.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, that when a Gentleman ſhall once have attain'd a certain knowledge of ſome Principles capable of affording him a good Tincture of Gard'ning, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he will not reſt with that bare knowledge of the firſt Elements, but will infallibly have a paſſionate deſire of knowing ſomething more of an Art, that he is ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with. He will ſoon improve the knowledge he ſhall have acquir'd, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not remain long in that dangerous and ſo much fear'd ſtation, which is call'd Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.</p>
                        <p>The Second Anſwer, which is no leſs material, is, that without doubt, that Smattering of an Ingenious Perſon, if we may call it ſo, is much better, being grounded upon good Principles, than the falſe Notion of knowledge of common <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> it being moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that you ſeldom find any thing among ſuch beyond a preſumptuous Pratling Ignorance, upheld by ſome wretched Rote. Is it not a great happineſs to be able to attain a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inſight into thoſe matters, and to put our ſelves above ſo many falſe reaſonings, we ſhould otherwiſe be lyable to, and ſo avoid a great deal of vexation, to purchaſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Pleaſure?</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I propoſe this, That if he cannot afford ſo much time as to arrive to a full Perfection (which is not abſolutely neceſſary) he may reſt aſſured that he may learn enough for his

purpoſe, that is, to be capable of ordering the moſt material Things that are to be done in his <hi>Garden,</hi> and to hinder the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> from Impoſing daily upon him, provided he be in ſome meaſure inſtructed in the Five or Six following Articles.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt relates to the Quality of the <hi>Ground,</hi> its neceſſary Depth, to the <hi>Tillage, Amendments</hi> and ordinary modelling of uſeful <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second relates to the <hi>Trees,</hi> to chuſe them well qualified, either when they are ſtill in the <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> or taken from thence, to know at leaſt the Names of the Principal Kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> of every Seaſon; to be able to diſtinguiſh them, and what number of each the Compaſs of his <hi>Garden</hi> may require; to underſtand how to prepare <hi>Trees</hi> both as to the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> before they are put into the Ground again; and afterwards to place them at a convenient diſtance, and expoſe them well; to know, if not all, the Rules of <hi>Pruning,</hi> yet at leaſt all the Principal ones, either as to <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> how to <hi>Pinch</hi> off ſome <hi>Branches,</hi> being over Vigorous; to Palliſade ſuch as require it, as alſo the <hi>Triming</hi> of ſuch uſeleſs <hi>Buds</hi> and <hi>Sprigs</hi> as cauſe a Confuſion; and laſtly to give every one of them the Beauty which they are capable of.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>The Dung of Leaves throughly rotten, is hardly fit for any thing, but to be thrown over new ſown Beds, to hinder the Rains or Waterings from beating too much upon the Surface, and ſo hinder the Seeds from riſing.</p>
                           <p>All the <hi>Legumes</hi> of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> require a great deal of Dung; the <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Layers</hi> of Trees require none.</p>
                           <p>The only good place to put the Amendments in, is towards the Surface.</p>
                           <p>The worſt place for Dung in Trenches (or places that are Dug in order to plant <hi>Trees)</hi> is in the Bottom.</p>

                           <p>That a <hi>Tree</hi> to be worth the Chuſing, whilſt yet in the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> muſt have a clean and ſhining Bark, and the <hi>Shoots</hi> of the Year, Long and Vigorous.</p>

As to <hi>Peach</hi> and <hi>Apricock Trees,</hi> thoſe that have not been <hi>Graffed</hi> above a Year, provided the <hi>Shoot</hi> be fair, are better than thoſe that have been <hi>Graffed</hi> Two or more; and yet the <hi>Peach Trees</hi> require more exactneſs in this than the <hi>Apricocks;</hi> and you muſt never take a <hi>Peach Tree,</hi> unleſs it has fine, ſound and whole <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> at the lower part of the <hi>Stem.</hi> The thickneſs of an Inch, or ſomewhat more in ſuch <hi>Stems,</hi> is what is particularly to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd in <hi>Peach Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Peaches Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Almond Trees</hi> thrive better in a dry light Ground, than in that which is Loamy and Moiſt.</p>
                           <p>But the clean contrary is to be obſerv'd for thoſe that are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Plum-Trees.</hi> In all other Dwarf <hi>Trees,</hi> the thickneſs muſt be between Two and Three Inches Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Lower Part.</p>
                           <p>Only excepting <hi>Apple Trees Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Paradice</hi> Stocks, for which the thickneſs of an Inch is ſufficient.</p>
                           <p>The Thickneſs of high <hi>Standards</hi> is to conſiſt of Five or Six Inches on the Lower Part, and the height of about Six or Seven Foot.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Graff</hi> of little <hi>Trees</hi> muſt be applied within two or three Fingers from the Ground.</p>
                           <p>And when it cloſes again, it argues much Vigour in the <hi>Foot,</hi> as well as a great deal of Skill in the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who has had the Ordering of it.</p>
                           <p>All manner of <hi>Pears</hi> ſucceed in <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and upon free Stocks, as well as upon <hi>Quince;</hi> but it muſt be Noted, they muſt only be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon free Stocks in Light Grounds, as well as in thoſe that are but of an ordinary Goodneſs.</p>
                           <p>Winter <hi>Bon Chreſtien Pears</hi> can hardly attain that Yellow, and <hi>Carnation</hi> Colour, which is to be deſired in them, either upon Dwarfs or Wall Trees being <hi>Graffed</hi> upon free Stocks, and therefore muſt be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince.</hi>

                           <p>After having <hi>Prun'd</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> you muſt cut the <hi>Steem</hi> of the Length it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, before you Plant it, and never ſtay to cut it till after 'tis Planted.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> I regulate that height to be about Five or Six Inches in a dry <hi>Soil,</hi> and about Eight or Nine when Moiſt.</p>
                           <p>And in <hi>high Standards</hi> the proper height is between Six and Seven Foot in all manner of <hi>Soils.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In Planting, care muſt be taken to turn the beſt <hi>Roots</hi> on that ſide which has moſt <hi>Earth,</hi> and that none, as much as is poſſible, may incline ſtreight downwards, but rather look towards the Horiſon.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe who after planting, ſhake or trample on little <hi>Trees,</hi> do them a great deal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; whereas on the contrary, it is abſolutely neceſſary to trample and raiſe the Ground about the great ones, to ſecure them againſt the Impetuoſity of the Winds.</p>
                           <p>The Head or Top of <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> or <hi>Wall Trees</hi> muſt lean towards the Wall, yet ſo, that the Extremity of the Head muſt be at Three or Four Inches diſtance from it, and the Wound muſt not appear.</p>
                           <p>The diſtance between them is to be regulated according to the Goodneſs of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and particularly according to the height of the Wall; they muſt be nearer to one another againſt high Walls, and at more diſtance againſt low ones.</p>
                           <p>In this particular Caſe of the common diſtance of <hi>Wall Trees,</hi> it is to be regulated from Five or Six Foot, to Ten, Eleven or Twelve. The Walls being Twelve Foot high or more, you muſt always let one <hi>Tree</hi> ſhoot up to garniſh the Top, between two that ſhall garniſh the Bottom; in which caſe the <hi>Trees</hi> muſt be planted within Five or Six Foot of one another: But againſt Walls that are not above Six or Seven Foot high, the diſtance muſt be about Nine Foot.</p>
                           <p>The diſtance of <hi>Dwarfs</hi> muſt be from between Eight and Nine Foot to Twelve, or even a little more, being <hi>Plum-Trees,</hi> or <hi>Kernel-Fruit</hi> upon Free Stocks.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>high Standards</hi> from Four Fathom to Seven or Eight, for great <hi>Plantations.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In good <hi>Soils</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> muſt be at a greater diſtance than in bad ones, becauſe there their Heads or Tops ſpread more.</p>

When Trenches are newly made, the <hi>Earth</hi> will ſink at leaſt Three or Four large Inches.</p>
                           <p>This is a very neceſſary Obſervation, to make in order to the keeping the <hi>Earth</hi> about them, higher than the Neighbouring Surface, and to avoid falling into the Inconveniency of having <hi>Trees</hi> ſunk too deep into the Ground.</p>
                           <p>For the Succeſs of Kernel <hi>Fruit,</hi> it matters but little whether the <hi>Graff</hi> be above or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground.</p>

                           <p>To have a reaſonable Inſight into the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> it is neceſſary at leaſt to know the Time and Cauſe, and eſpecially, if poſſible, the Manner.</p>
                           <p>As to the Time, it is always good to <hi>Prune</hi> from the Beginning of the Fall until the New Leaves grow again, and no <hi>Tree</hi> muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> above once a Year.</p>
                           <p>Keeping within theſe Bounds, it will not be improper to Prune Weak <hi>Trees</hi> ſooner, and thoſe that are Vigorous later.</p>
                           <p>As for the Cauſe, there are two Reaſons for <hi>Pruning;</hi> the firſt to diſpoſe <hi>Trees</hi> to bear finer <hi>Fruit;</hi> and the ſecond to render them at all Times more pleaſing to ſight than they ſhould be, if they were not <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To attain the Effect of this ſecond Condition, muſt be by the means of the Figure, that is given to every <hi>Tree.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That Figure muſt differ according to the difference of the Ground <hi>Plats,</hi> and does not Extend beyond <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Wall Trees;</hi> for as for the generality <hi>high Standards</hi> are not Prun'd often.</p>
                           <p>The thick <hi>Branches</hi> only are capable of affording that Figure, which is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be well underſtood, and muſt be had conſtantly in the Mind.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Dwarf,</hi> in order to be of a beautiful Figure, muſt have a low <hi>Stem,</hi> be open in the middle, and of a round Circumference, equally garniſh'd on the Sides: Of theſe four Conditions the moſt material is that which preſcribes the opening of the middle, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Defect conſiſting in a Confuſion of too much Wood in that very middle, which of all things muſt be avoided.</p>
                           <p>The Perfection of a <hi>Wall Tree</hi> conſiſts in having its ſtrength and <hi>Branches</hi> equally divided on the two Oppoſite Sides, in order to be equally furniſh'd throughout the whole Extent of it, whatever part the Head begins at, whether it has a low <hi>Stem,</hi> in which caſe it muſt begin within half a Foot from the Ground, or high, and then it begins from the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Stem,</hi> which is commonly about Six or Seven Foot.</p>
                           <p>The main thing in this depends on the Diſtinction which is to be made among the <hi>Branches,</hi> and the good uſe that is to be made of them; the <hi>Branches</hi> are either thick and ſtrong, or ſlender and weak; every one of them furniſhing us with a Reaſon to take it away or preſerve it, to leave it long, or to <hi>prune</hi> it ſhort.</p>
                           <p>Among both, ſome are good, and others ill, whether Thick or Slender.</p>
                           <p>The good are thoſe that grow according to the Order of Nature, and thoſe have thick or large <hi>Eyes,</hi> pretty cloſe to one another.</p>
                           <p>The ill ones on the contrary, are ſuch as grow againſt the Order of Nature, have flat Eyes, and at a great diſtance, for which Reaſon they are call'd <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Falſe Wood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To underſtand that Order of Nature, you muſt know in the firſt Place, that the <hi>Branches</hi> ſhould only ſhoot from thoſe that were cut ſhorter at the laſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> and that all ſuch as ſhoot from other Parts are <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Falſe Wood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, that according to the Order of New <hi>Branches,</hi> if there be more than one, that which ſhoots from the Extremity muſt be thicker and longer than that which grows immediately beneath it; and this thicker and longer than the third, and ſo of all the reſt; and conſequently when any of them prove thick where they ſhould be ſlender, it is a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Falſe Wood.</hi> There are ſome few Exceptions ſet down in the Treatiſe of <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48210:30"/>
The good ſmall <hi>Branches,</hi> both as to Stone and Kernel-<hi>Fruit,</hi> are the bearing <hi>Branches;</hi> and the good Thick ones are for <hi>Wood;</hi> but quite contrary as to <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> and <hi>Vines.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As for the manner of <hi>Pruning</hi> it is generally look'd upon as much more difficult than really it is; the Principles, which are pretty eaſie, being once underſtood, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the Operation, and yet it is the Maſter-Piece of <hi>Gard'ning.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Chief Maxims are, Firſt, That Young <hi>Trees</hi> are much more eaſie to <hi>Purne</hi> than old Ones, eſpecially thoſe having been often Ill <hi>Prun'd,</hi> and not having the Figure they ſhould have: The beſt <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are very much put to it, to correct thoſe old Defects. I have given particular Rules for ſuch Inconveniencies.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That the ſtrong <hi>Branohes</hi> muſt be cut ſhort, and commonly reduc'd to the length of Five, Six or Seven Inches; yet there are certain Caſes in which they muſt be kept longer; but thoſe are not common: I ſpecifie them in my great Treatiſe.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, That among the others, there are ſome that may be kept ſhorter, and others longer; that is, even to Eight, Nine and Ten Inches; nay, and to a Foot, a Foot and a half, and perhaps more, eſpecially in <hi>Peach, Plum,</hi> and <hi>Cherry Wall Trees,</hi> which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated accorded to their Strength and Thickneſs, to be capable of Nouriſhing and Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without breaking ſuch <hi>Fruits</hi> as they ſhall be Burthen'd with.</p>
                           <p>Upon Vigorous well Proportion'd <hi>Trees,</hi> there can hardly be too many of thoſe we call <hi>Branches for Fruit,</hi> provided they cauſe no Confuſion: But as for the Thick ones, which we call <hi>Branches for Wood,</hi> for the Generality in all ſorts of <hi>Trees</hi> only one muſt be preſerv'd, of all thoſe that have been produc'd by every <hi>Branch,</hi> having been <hi>Prun'd</hi> the preceding Year.</p>
                           <p>Unleſs the <hi>Trees,</hi> being very Vigorous, the Extremities of the new <hi>Branches</hi> chance to be very diſtant the one from the other, and looking towards different oppoſite Parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare on the ſides; which of neceſſity will require, being fill'd up for the perfecting of the Figure; in which Caſe we may leave Two, nay Three, provided they be all of different Lengths, and never form a forked Figure.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Fruit</hi> bearing <hi>Branches,</hi> periſh after having perform'd their Duty with this Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in Stone-<hi>Fruit</hi> they die at the End of one Year, or Two, or Three at moſt.</p>
                           <p>And in Kernel-<hi>Fruit,</hi> not till after having ſerved Four or Five Years.</p>
                           <p>Therefore foreſight is of great Uſe, to think betimes of providing new <hi>Branches</hi> to fill up the Room of ſuch as we know are to die, in order to avoid growing too bare and barren.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe kind of <hi>Fruit Branches</hi> are good, whatever part of the <hi>Tree</hi> they ſhoot from, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inwards or Outwards.</p>
                           <p>But a Thick one is always Ill, when it ſhoots Inwards in a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> unleſs it be to cloſe ſuch as open too much, as it commonly happens in <hi>Butter Pear Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So that the Beauty of the <hi>Trees,</hi> and the Beauty and Abundance of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> depend chiefly upon good <hi>Pruning,</hi> the good Management of certain <hi>Branches</hi> that are at once Thick and Good, and the taking quite away of ſuch as are both Thick and Bad.</p>
                           <p>And whereas it happens ſometimes, that a <hi>Branch</hi> having been left long the foregoing Year in order to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> receiving more Nouriſhment than naturally it ought to have, grows thick, and ſhoots other thick ones. One of the material Points of <hi>Pruning</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not only in uſing this <hi>Branch</hi> like other <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> but eſpecially in not leaving upon it any thick one grown on the Extremity of it, unleſs it be with a deſign to let the <hi>Tree</hi> ſhoot upwards, in order to make it a <hi>Standard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This good Conduct teaches for the Generality to lower <hi>Trees,</hi> I mean, that it is better in <hi>Pruning,</hi> wholly to take away the higheſt <hi>Branches</hi> that are thick, preſerving only the loweſt, than to do the contrary. Provided always, that the higheſt prove not better plac'd than the lower, to contribute towards the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which is not uſual; for in ſuch a Caſe, the loweſt muſt be taken away, and the higheſt preſerv'd: The firſt deſign in this is, to have fine <hi>Trees,</hi> it being moſt certain that the Abundance of fine <hi>Fruit</hi> never fails attending ſuch a Diſpoſition of a fine Figure, ſince none of the ſmall <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> are removed, but on the contrary are thereby multiplied, and afterwards freed from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might obſtruct them.</p>
                           <p>The lowring of them, contracts into the <hi>Branch</hi> ſeated on the Extremity of that which has been cut down, all the <hi>Sap</hi> that would have gone into the Superior, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, that have been taken away; whereby the preſerv'd <hi>Branch</hi> grows much ſtronger, and conſequently capable of greater Production than it ſhould have been.</p>
                           <p>And whereas ſometimes, contrary to the Order of Nature, weak <hi>Branches</hi> ſhoot from the Extremity of the thick one, that had been ſhortned at the preceding <hi>Pruning;</hi> this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct teaches us to preſerve thoſe weak <hi>Branches,</hi> and to perform the <hi>Pruning</hi> upon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thick ones, which being underneath that, or thoſe weak ones, appears moſt proper for the perfecting of the Beauty of the Figure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48210:31"/>
Beſides the <hi>Pruning</hi> we have now mention'd, we ſometimes perform another Operation which we call <hi>Pinching</hi> or <hi>Breaking;</hi> which is commonly of more uſe for <hi>Peach Trees</hi> than any others, unleſs it be upon all ſorts of <hi>Graffs</hi> perform'd upon thick Vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> already placed in the <hi>Garden:</hi> The Effect of this <hi>Pinching</hi> is to hinder the <hi>Branches</hi> from growing too thick, and conſequently uſeleſs for <hi>Fruit,</hi> as alſo from growing too long, to hinder a <hi>Tree</hi> from ſhooting upwards too ſoon, or from being broken by high Winds.</p>
                           <p>The Effect of it, is likewiſe to produce many <hi>Branches</hi> inſtead of one, among which ſome ſmall ones will be of uſe for <hi>Fruit,</hi> and ſome thick ones for <hi>Wood:</hi> The uſe of it, or rather the time of uſing it, is about <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and muſt be perform'd by breaking with the Nail that <hi>Branch,</hi> which being about half a Foot, or ſomewhat more in length, begins to appear too thick.</p>
                           <p>In Order to <hi>Pinch</hi> or break to the purpoſe, the thick <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be reduc'd to Three or Four <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds;</hi> and when the <hi>Branch</hi> ſo <hi>Pinch'd</hi> proves obſtinate in ſhooting thick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the ſame Operation of <hi>Pinching</hi> muſt be perform'd again, but a Weak <hi>Branch</hi> muſt never be <hi>Pinch'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I will neither mention here the <hi>Pruning</hi> of Old <hi>Trees,</hi> nor of <hi>Vines,</hi> or <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> which I refer to the particular Treatiſes I have written upon each of them.</p>

                           <p>AS to the Profit it is ſufficient to know, that the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> muſt afford its owner ſome Thing in every Month of the Year: Inſomuch, that he may never be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſend for out of his <hi>Garden,</hi> what skilful <hi>Gard'ners</hi> expoſe to Sale in Publick Places.</p>
                           <p>For Example, in <hi>November, December, January, February, March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> beſides what has been preſerv'd in the Store-houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Kernel-<hi>Fruit, Roots</hi> of all kinds, <hi>Cardoons, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, Colliflowers,</hi> and <hi>Pumpions.</hi> The <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> muſt afford <hi>Potherbs,</hi> that is, <hi>Sorrel, Beets, Winter Cabbage, Leeks, Chibols, Parſly, Muſhrums, Sallads,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Winter-Succory, Selery, Macedonian Parſly</hi> or <hi>Smallage,</hi> with the Furnitures of <hi>Charvel, Burnet, Alleluya</hi> or <hi>Wood Sorrel, Balm, Tarragon, Paſſepierre,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>In caſe there be hot Beds, during the great Colds you may expect Novelties, <hi>viz.</hi> Green <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> Small <hi>Lettuce, Charvil, Baſil, Creſſes, Hartshorn,</hi> and even <hi>Sorrel, &amp;c.</hi> at all times; to which may be added, <hi>Raddiſhes</hi> in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Purcelain</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> you may eaſily have abundance of <hi>Pot-herbs,</hi> and new <hi>Sallads</hi> of all Kinds, <hi>viz.

Currans</hi> commonly begin in <hi>June,</hi> with <hi>Strawberries</hi> and <hi>Rasberries</hi> for the remainder of the Month, and <hi>Muſhrums</hi> always.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> an equal abundance with the preceding Months. And beſides that, <hi>French Beans,</hi> new <hi>Apple-Cabbage,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Melons, Pears, Plums, Peaches</hi> and <hi>Figs.</hi>

                           <p>As for the Method of making all theſe Things grow, together with the Works of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Month, is what a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> muſt of Neceſſity Underſtand and Practice; and when the Maſter ſhall be ſo curious as either to deſire to Underſtand it himſelf, to correct the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> when he fails, or to enjoy the Pleaſure of ſeeing the Order and Succeſſion of the Productions.

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is not ſufficient, as we have already ſaid, for our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> to have acquired the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what we have mention'd, he muſt moreover be Capacitated to judge by <note place="margin">Vitio noſtro agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultura male ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, qui rem ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticam peſſimo cuique ſervorum velut carnifici noxae dedimus, quam majorum noſtrorum opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quiſque op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time tractavit. <hi>Columella.</hi>
                           </note> himſelf, without any other help of the Skill, or Ignorance of all ſorts of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> in order, if poſſible, never to be deceiv'd in his Choice; but yet the Truth is, that the number of the good Qualifications, eſſential to that Employment, is ſo conſiderable, that whenever I reflect on them all, I almoſt Deſpair of ever meeting with an Accompliſh'd one.</p>
                        <p>And yet without rendring the thing almoſt Impoſſible, and without minding a ſcruple that comes into my mind, that I can ſay nothing here but what every Body knows as well as my ſelf, I am reſolv'd to treat of this Buſineſs at large, being perſwaded that it is one of the moſt Eſſential of all thoſe that belong to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and indeed the very Soul of <hi>Gardens;</hi> for ſince a perpetual <hi>Culture</hi> is the only way to render a <hi>Garden</hi> Delightful, it is impoſſible ever to expect it ſo, unleſs it be in the hands of a Skilful Laborious <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore barely relating my Method on ſuch Occaſions, I ſhall only ſay, that to act Prudently in the Choice of a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> it is fit to mind fitſt the exterior Part of his Perſon, <note place="margin">Pater ipſe colen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, haud facilem eſſe viam voluit. <hi>Virg. Georg.</hi> 1. Labor omnia vincit improbus, &amp; duris urgens in rebus egeſtas. <hi>Georg.</hi> 1.</note> and ſecondly, the good interior Qualifications that are abſolutely requir'd in him.</p>
                        <p>By the firſt, I mean his Age, Health, Shape and Motion; and by the ſecond, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity in his Manners, Honeſty in his common Dealings, and chiefly Capacity in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall begin with the good Qualifications of the Outſide, of which the Eyes are the only and firſt Judges; for often at firſt ſight we find our ſelves all of a ſudden inclined either to a good Liking and Eſteem, or Scorn and Averſion for the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> that offers himſelf.</p>
                        <p>As for the firſt Conſideration, which is about Age, Health, Shape and Motion, I am <note place="margin">In rebus agreſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus maxime of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficia Juvenum, &amp; imperia ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num congruunt. <hi>Palladius.</hi>
                           </note> for a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> that is neither too Old nor too Young; both Extreams being equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Too much Youth is to be ſuſpected of Ignorance and Wildneſs, and too much Age, unleſs ſupported by ſome Children of a reaſonable Age and ſome Capacity, is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Lazineſs or Infirmity. Therefore, in my Opinion, the beſt Age is from Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five to Fifty and Fifty-five, carefully obſerving, whether the Face denotes any viſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Health, without any evaporated Brain, or fooliſh Preſumption; likewiſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully chuſing a Shape and Motion denoting a Sturdy, Vigorous, Nimble Man, not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be dreſs'd or adorn'd above the common Station of a <hi>Gard'ner;</hi> all which Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be believ'd, and I affirm to be very material.</p>
                        <p>Being ſatisfy'd with the Exterior part, the Eſſential Proofs of his Merit muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, to which End a little Converſation will be requir'd with the ſaid <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Gardner</hi>'s Anſwer to the Firſt, may give us great Light to Judge of his Deſert or Imperfections, becauſe that if he names ſeveral Credible Houſes where he has liv'd in a few Years Compaſs, without being able to give good Reaſons for his leaving them, it will give cauſe to ſuſpect either his Ignorance or Debauchneſs.</p>
                        <p>If on the contrary, he give warrantable Reaſons for his ſo doing, it may be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to reſolve upon the taking of him, after having firſt made the uſual Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in ſuch Caſes, and receiv'd a good Account of his Conduct, from ſuch as are capable of giving it, and of whom it is to be expected, provided Malice and Revenge have no part in it.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe little Cares challenge as much eſteem and kindneſs towards a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> as any other Teſtimony he can render; it ſhews his being well Intention'd, that he has ſome Qualifications, that are but ſeldom acquir'd, unleſs they be Natural, <hi>viz.</hi> Affection, Curioſity, Neatneſs and a docible Spirit; and indeed a <hi>Garden</hi> is generally in a very good Caſe, under the management of ſuch a Man. It generally is the firſt in producing Novelties, it is clean and free from Weeds, the Walks are neat and well level'd, and the whole commonly furniſh'd with all that can be expected in every Seaſon of the year; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thoſe who can meet with ſuch, and have no cauſe to complain, as ſo many other Gentlemen daily do, of their ill Fortune upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>The ſcarcity of good Workmen of that kind is not to be wonder'd at, while the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ingenious Men of moſt kinds is pretty conſiderable; the ſource of the Ignorance of moſt <hi>Gard'ners</hi> proceeding from their knowing nothing for the moſt part, but what they have ſeen practis'd, by thoſe under whom they firſt began to work.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe kind of Maſters had never learn'd elſewhere, nor imagin'd of themſelves the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of every part of their Work; ſo that not knowing it, and continuing to work for the moſt part by chance, or rather by rote, they have been no more capable of teaching it, than their Prentices of enquiring it; ſo that perhaps excepting ſome Skill in <hi>graſſing</hi> and <hi>couching</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> in <hi>Tilling,</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> ordering of a <hi>Bed,</hi> ſowing and watering ſome <hi>Seeds,</hi> clipping of <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Palliſados,</hi> which are all very eaſie to do and learn, and may be learn'd by Boys ſeeing others do it; I ſay, excepting ſuch kind of Works which are none of the moſt material, it may be affirm'd that they hardly know any thing, eſpecially as to the main part of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> which is the Conduct of all ſorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> the beauty and ſingular goodneſs of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> their Maturity well underſtood, and an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of the Novelties of every Month in the Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed they have attain'd the boldneſs and dexterity of uſing the <hi>Saw</hi> and <hi>Pruning-knife,</hi>

                           </note> but never had any Rules or Principles to do it Judiciouſly; they venture to cut at random, what they think good; and ſo a <hi>Tree,</hi> if I may uſe the Expreſſion, not being able to oppoſe its Enemies, is mangled and maim'd, diſcovering its Grievances, by falling into decay, by its ill favour'd Figure, and eſpecially by the ſmall quantity of ill <hi>Fruit</hi> it produces.</p>
                        <p>This is in reality the common Prenticeſhip of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> or rather the Epidemical Diſeaſe of all <hi>Gardens;</hi> I am not ignorant that there are ſome well meaning <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt would grow skilful, were they well Inſtructed; thoſe deſerve Pity and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and therefore I never fail to aſſiſt them in all I can.</p>
                        <p>I am alſo ſenſible that there are ſome, who either of themſelves, or having been brought up under a good Maſter, have both Worth and Capacity, and afterwards are careful of making good Prentices; therefore it is good to have ſome brought up by ſuch hands, and approv'd by their Maſters.</p>
                        <p>However, though theſe Precautions might ſeem ſufficient, I am ſtill of Opinion, that before we ingage any farther, eſpecially, only wanting a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> for an ordinary <hi>Garden,</hi> it will not be amiſs to find out ſome occaſion to make the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> you have ſome Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to chooſe, ſet his hands to ſome laborious piece of Work, to ſee how he goes about it; as to <hi>Till</hi> ſome ſpot of <hi>Ground,</hi> to carry ſome Watering-Pots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which Tryals it will be eaſie to judge whether he has thoſe neceſſary Qualifications of Body; whether he acts naturally, or forces himſelf; if he be handy and laborious, or clumſey and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: A man that is ſoon out of breath, does more than his ſtrength can permit, and conſequently cannot make a good Workman, I mean, a laſting one; ſuch a man is not fit for our turn, unleſs we barely want one to order and manage, which is not uſual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> where ſuch a one is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing we are hitherto ſatisfy'd with the Anſwers and Work of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who offers himſelf, there are ſtill other very material Qualifications to be wiſh'd for, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he may be able to write a Letter, for though writing be not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> yet it muſt be granted that it is a very conſiderable advantage, to the end that being abſent from his Maſter, he may be able to receive his Orders himſelf, give him an account of his <hi>Garden,</hi> keep a Regiſter of all he does in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> If marry'd, it is ſit that his Wife, beſides the Care of her Family, may love and be capable of working about her Husband's <hi>Trade;</hi> it is an ineſtimable Treaſure for the Perfection of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> as well as for the good Fortune of the <hi>Gard'ner:</hi> Such a Wife cleanſes, ſcrapes and weeds, while the Maſter and his Men labour about harder, more in haſte, and more material Works; and when her Husband is abſent or ſick, ſhe calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every body to do their duty; ſhe gathers the <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which often a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part periſhes for want of being gather'd in due time: In ſine, ſhe is to prevent a great many diſorders, which we obſerve, where a <hi>Gard'ner's</hi> Wife does not love to work in the <hi>Garden.</hi> I am of Opinion that it will be proper to ſee her, to judge whether ſuch important helps may be expected from her, and ſee whether ſhe be cleanly, and has nothing diſguſting in her. To this I might add, that in many Countrey Houſes the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is made Houſe-keeper, when his Wife is ingenious and cleanly, which is always of great Uſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is neceſſary to enquire the Names of the Maſters under whom this <hi>Gard'ner</hi> has learn'd his <hi>Trade;</hi> when he cites for a good Maſter, a Man of known Ignorance, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himſelf upon it, it is a ſign of Incapacity, though in other things the Prentice may chance to know more than his Maſter.</p>
                        <p>There are yet ſome other Marks by which it may be eaſie to judge of the Merit of <hi>Gard'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> for inſtance, I do not like a great Babler, who talks of nothing but his Skill, or affects hard Words, which he thinks are fine, though they really are not ſo.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I like him, who without being able to give a good reaſon for it, values himſelf upon equally deſpiſing what he has not ſeen, as well as what he has ſeen, who has ſo great <note place="margin">Diſtruſt thoſe <hi>Gard'ners</hi> who boaſt of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are Ignorant of. <hi>Xenophon.</hi>
                           </note> an Opinion of his Ability, as to think that he can learn nothing new; who thinks he ſhould wrong himſelf in inquiring after, or hearkening to Men of Reputation; as if this Wretch thereby fear'd to bring his Knowledge in queſtion. There are but too many, who upon the Queſtions that are made to them, anſwer with a diſdainful Smile. It would be a fine thing if at my Age I did not know my <hi>Trade,</hi> and thereupon would not for any thing acknowledge their Faults, or be better inform'd.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome who always affect to ruin whatever is Ancient in their <hi>Garden,</hi> and to make perpetual Novelties, and thoſe ſtudy to amuſe their Maſters with ſome hopes of the future, both to hinder him, in the mean time, from perceiving their Ignorance, for the time paſt or preſent, as well as to make their Profit by the Expence incident to new Works.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, there are ſome others, whoſe Stupidity is ſo great, that they never imagine any thing, and had rather leave the <hi>Gardens</hi> they undertake in the ſame Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they find them, though never ſo much out of Order, than alter the leaſt thing about them; who having a great number of ugly <hi>Trees,</hi> quite decay'd, or ſquares of <hi>Strawberrys, Artichokes</hi> and <hi>Sparagus, &amp;c.</hi> no longer producing any thing fine or good, inſtead of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to remedy it, which is very eaſie, will cry that it is enough for them to preſerve things as they find them.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two ſorts of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are equally to be avoided; thoſe who are continually brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Skill in <hi>Graffing,</hi> thereby likewiſe give an infallible proof of their Incapacity as to what relates to the main part of <hi>Gard'ning;</hi> I am not ignorant that 'tis neceſſary to <hi>graff</hi> well, but at the ſame time I know that a Woman, or a Child of eight or ten years of Age, may do it as well as the beſt <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> nothing has produc'd ſo many Block-heads in point of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> as that Skill in <hi>Graffing.</hi> It is the <hi>Nuſſeries</hi> that produce ſo many pittiful <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who have, as it were, corrupted and infected all that belongs to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> looking upon themſelves as being the greateſt Maſters in that Art, as ſoon as they can <hi>Graff</hi> well, and in that belief undertake the Management of any <hi>Garden</hi> what ever.</p>
                        <p>There are yet another kind of Blockheads, who cannot ſpeak Three Words of their own Trade, without intermixing the Full and Wainal-Moon. Pretending, and yet knowing no Reaſon for it, that it is an Obſervation altogether neceſſary for the Succeſs of all that belongs to <hi>Gard'ning:</hi> They really Fancy they can perſwade us by ſuch Words, that they are acquainted with all the Myſteries of that Art; ſo that having ſaid with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Haughtineſs, in their Jargon, that every <hi>Friday</hi> bears a Decreaſe, and that <hi>Good-Friday</hi> is Infallible for <hi>Sowing</hi> and <hi>Graffing,</hi> for <hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>Pruning, &amp;c.</hi> They really think 'tis the greateſt Happineſs in the World, for any Body to have them for their <hi>Gard'ners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48210:33"/>
I fully examine in my Treatiſe of Reflection what relates to thoſe Viſions, which in point of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> I really look upon to be as Ridiculous as Old; therefore I always ſuſpect thoſe talkers of Decreaſe, who are Dumb upon the leaſt difficulty propos'd to them upon ſuch Maxims, their ſole Anſwer being, that in this they follow an Opinion in Vogue all the World over.</p>
                        <p>I think I have been pretty Exact in the Obſervation of the Good and Ill Qualifications, that are commonly met with among <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> now in my Opinion it will not be amiſs, eſpecially in Relation to thoſe who know but little, to enjoin them to ſtudy Carefully in order to improve themſelves.</p>
                        <p>As to thoſe who have Skill and Capacity, I conjure them with all my Heart to continue to perfect themſelves, thereby more and more to deſerve the Favour of their Maſters, if good ones, if not, to deſerve better.</p>
                        <p>I find my ſelf very much inclin'd to oblige all thoſe who are deſirous to learn, either in aſſiſting them with ſome Inſtructions in thoſe parts of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> they are not ſufficiently acquainted with, or in Procuring them good Places, in conſiderable Houſes.</p>
                        <p>As on the other Hand to Deſpiſe, and render no manner of good Offices to ſuch as have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                           </gap>one of thoſe good, and altogether neceſſary, Qualifications.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, in order to eaſe the Mind of a Maſter who wants a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> if he himſelf be <note place="margin">No <hi>Gard'ner</hi> can be good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Skilful and Ignorance is the greateſt Defect he can poſſibly have. <hi>Zenophon.</hi>
                           </note> not Ignorant of the good Maxims of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> in my Opinion he cannot do better than to Examin the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who comes to offer his Service, upon all the principal Points of <hi>Culture,</hi> being perſwaded that commonly thoſe who are work-Men, can ſpeak Indifferently well as to their Trade; and conſequently that it is a very ill Sign, when they cannot ſpeak three Words to the purpoſe about it.</p>
                        <p>Not but that there are ſome People who can work better than Talk, and ſome who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have more Facility to expreſs themſelves than others; but in this Caſe, we look firſt for <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> not Orators; and in the ſecond Place expect no Eloquence, only ſome marks of a Neceſſary Capacity, both to be ſatisfied that a <hi>Garden</hi> will always be in a good Caſe, it being in the Hands of a good <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and to hope for the Satisfaction of having ſometimes the Pleaſure of diſcourſing about <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and to propoſe Queſtions upon the Matter occurring. A Judicious Man can never want Capacity to Judge and Diſtinguiſh in ſuch a Caſe, what may be good, or indifferent for his Uſe, and of being ſatisfied with what Reaſon and his Occaſions may require of a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> without looking farther.</p>

                     <head>OF FRUIT-GARDENS AND Kitchen-Gardens. VOL. I. PART II.</head>
                     <p>I Am particularly to treat here of Four Things: The firſt relating to the Advantages to be wiſh'd for, in order to make <hi>Gardens:</hi> The ſecond relating to <hi>Earth,</hi> in reſpect to thoſe <hi>Gardens:</hi> The third, to what is proper to Correct the Defects we meet with in <hi>Gardens</hi> already made: The fourth, to the manner of <hi>Cultivating Gardens,</hi> together with ſuch Qualifications of <hi>Soil,</hi> as are proper for every particular Kind of <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will ſpeak of what relates to the firſt Article, after having firſt declar'd that I am only to treat here of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> whether they be City <hi>Gardens,</hi> which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are but of a Moderate Compaſs: The Ground of conſiderable Cities being too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to employ much of it in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> or Country <hi>Gardens,</hi> which for the generality are pretty large, at leaſt much larger than thoſe of Cities, and that in proportion to the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Maſter, and Statelineſs of every Houſe.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible, that for the generality, both City and Country <hi>Gardens</hi> are made for the Conveniency of the Houſes, and therefore ſhould be pretty cloſe to them; yet conſidering that thoſe of the Country require a pretty large Extent, in order to yield conſiderably, being neceſſary for Suſtenance, as well as Pleaſure: In my Opinion, it were to be wiſh'd that the Houſes were built for the <hi>Gardens,</hi> and not the <hi>Gardens</hi> made for the Houſes. I mean, that one of the Chief Conſiderations in the Choice of the Situation of Houſes, ſhould be particularly to pitch upon a proper Place to make fine and good <hi>Gardens</hi> with Eaſe, which however is but ſeldom minded. There are other more prevailing Conſiderations moſt People fix upon: For Inſtance, a fine Proſpect, the Neighbourhood of a Wood or River, the Conveniency and Pleaſure of Hunting, the Facility of making Fountains or Canals, the Advantage of the Income, or ſome other Conſideration of the Adjacency of Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the <hi>Gardens</hi> in Queſtion are commonly the laſt Thing thought upon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48210:34"/>
and conſequently much more the Works of Nicety and After-thought, than of Choice or Forecaſt.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it is much more common to become Maſter of a Houſe ready Built, either by Purchaſe or Succeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to chuſe the Situation, and begin to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it; ſo that generally People are neceſſitated to make ſuch <hi>Gardens</hi> as the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of their Houſes will allow, which is the Reaſon they are not commonly ſo good as they ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing a Man were in a Condition to chuſe, I will take the Liberty to explain here what I think moſt proper to be done, to ſuceeed in the choice of a <hi>Garden</hi> for a Houſe, as I would willingly do as to the Choice of the Situation of that Houſe, were this a proper Place for it.</p>

                     <div n="2" type="chapter">
                        <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Of <hi>Earth</hi> in General.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN Order to prove what <hi>Earth</hi> is, not taking in a Philoſophical or Chriſtian Sence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is underſtood the whole Maſs, this not being a queſtion proper to be decided in this Place: It is ſufficient to know, <hi>Earth</hi> being conſidered in that Sence, that it is a great round Maſs, which forming one part of the created World, is Situated in the middle of the Celeſtial Sphere; where, by the Orders of the Creator, it ſuſtains it ſelf, as it were by its own Weight.</p>
                        <p>But to take <hi>Earth</hi> in the Sence of a good <hi>Husbandman,</hi> or a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> to be able to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what it is in relation to all the ſmall Particles that compoſe it, and the <hi>Culture</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the Hand of Man.</p>
                        <p>In that Sence, I think, I may ſay, that <hi>Earth</hi> is a quantity of a certain kind of ſmall Sand, which by the Operation of a certain Salt, wherewith Nature has endued every Grain of that Sand, is proper for the Production of <hi>Vegetables;</hi> in order to which there muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Grains together, which receiving a temperate Moiſture, form a compacted Body, which afterwards receiving ſome degrees of moderate Heat, ſeems to compoſe an animated Body: So that without theſe two helps of Moiſture and Heat, this <hi>Earth</hi> remains uſeleſs, and as it were dead. 'Tis almoſt in the ſame manner that <hi>Flower,</hi> which is an entire Body, compoſed of an Infinite Number of ſmall Particles, all well ſeperated the one from the other; this <hi>Flower,</hi> I ſay, being moiſtned to a certain degree, forms Paſte or Pap, either of which being ſeaſon'd with a little Salt, and afterwards heated to a certain degree, become proper for the Nouriſhment of Man; whereas this <hi>Flower</hi> would remain uſeleſs or dead, if Water, Salt and Fire were not introduc'd to Animate it. However, we find this difference between <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Flower,</hi> that the laſt being once wetted, alters its nature to that degree, that it cannot return to its firſt Condition, although the Moiſture be altogether drein'd out of it,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48210:35"/>
whereas on the contrary, <hi>Earth</hi> having once loſt the Moiſture it had receiv'd, remains in the ſame Condition it was before, when it receives a ſecond Moiſture; but yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ought not to deſtroy our Compariſon.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon that induces me to ſay that <hi>Earth</hi> is a kind of Sand, is, that in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, it really appears a ſandy Thing; I will not take upon me to explain what Sand is, ſince I can ſay nothing that is particular about it, nor new, I ſhall only ſay in General, That there are ſeveral kind of Sands, of which ſome are very dry and barren, like thoſe of the Sea, Rivers, Sand Pits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others Fat and Fruitful, ſome more, ſome leſs: Thoſe that are Fatteſt and moſt Fertile, make the beſt <hi>Earth;</hi> the others that are not ſo Fat, or have no Fatneſs at all, make but ordinary or bad <hi>Earth,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as are Light, Dry and Sandy: Moreover ſome are ſofter, which make ſoft eaſie <hi>Soil</hi> or <hi>Mould;</hi> others courſer, which make a rough Loam, hard to be manag'd. In fine, ſome are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous and Sticking together, of which thoſe that are but moderately ſo, make ſtrong <hi>Earth;</hi> others that are more inclining to it, make clean Loamy <hi>Earth,</hi> and thoſe that are extreamly Unctuous, make clayiſh and heavy <hi>Earth,</hi> altogether unfit for <hi>Culture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides the difference of Sands, in Relation to Fruitfulneſs and Barrenneſs, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which only differ as to Colour; for among <hi>Sands</hi> ſome are Blackiſh, others Reddiſh; ſome are White, ſome Grey and others Yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence <hi>Earth</hi> derive the Names of Black, Red, White, Grey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But thoſe kind of Colours are not very Eſſential to the goodneſs of <hi>Soil,</hi> as we ſhall demonſtrate hereafter.</p>
                        <p>It is moſt certain, that thoſe Fertile Sands have really ſome Qualities in themſelves, or rather a certain fruitful Salt, which is communicated to the Water that Moiſtens them, which being ſeaſon'd by theſe Qualities, muſt ſerve for the Production of <hi>Plants.</hi> Juſt in the ſame Manner as <hi>Senné, Rubarb</hi> and moſt <hi>Plants</hi> have in themſelves Medicinal Virtues and Properties, which communicate themſelves to the Water into which they are Infus'd, for the Uſe of the Health of Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Truth is undeniable.</p>
                        <p>I might aſſert here in the firſt Place, that <hi>Earth</hi> (conſidering it in it ſelf as one of the Four Elements) has really no Original or Natural Diſpoſition for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> being in its principal Qualities Cold and Dry, whereas <hi>Vegetation</hi> requires Heat and Moiſture; but as by <note place="margin">Ét vocavit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us aridam ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram. <hi>Gen. cap. 1. v.</hi> 11.</note> the Expreſs Order and Command of Divine Providence, it finds it ſelf endu'd with a Salt neceſſary for Fertility, and is afterwards aſſiſted both by the Rays of the Sun, and Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Fires which give it heat, as well as by ſome Waters that moiſten it, it ſeems to change its Nature; ſo that, in ſubmiſſion to ſo abſolute a Command of the Sovereign Maſter, it appears as if it were a living animated Being, a Being, having its particular <note place="margin">Germinet terra herbam viren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp;c. <hi>Gen. cap. 1. v.</hi> 11.</note> Activity, that is, of Producing, as if in Effect <hi>Plants</hi> were no more in relation to it than the Teeth of an Animal are in relation to that Animal: I mean, that as it is the Animal that Lives, and not the Teeth; ſo it would be proper to ſay, that the <hi>Earth</hi> lives, and not the <hi>Vegetables.</hi> This <hi>Earth,</hi> I ſay, in Obedience to that Command, makes that vaſt number of different Productions we have ſo much Reaſon to admire.</p>
                        <p>I might ſay, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there was a ſecond Command, after the Curſe occaſion'd by <note place="margin">Spinas, &amp; tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los germinabit tibi, &amp;c. <hi>Gen. cap. 3. v.</hi> 18. In laboribus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes ex ea cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis diebus vitae tuae. <hi>Gen. cap. 3. v.</hi> 17.</note> the Diſobedience of Man, and that by Vertue of that ſecond Command, that <hi>Earth</hi> ſeems moſt Inclin'd to produce Ill <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Weeds;</hi> ſo that this very Man having for his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment receiv'd a particular Order to <hi>Cultivate</hi> that <hi>Earth</hi> for his Subſiſtance, he finds himſelf in ſome manner neceſſitated to wage a perpetual War againſt it: He Labours and makes uſe of all his Induſtry to Vanquiſh and Overcome the malicious Inclination of that <hi>Earth,</hi> which on its part defends it ſelf with all its Might, to avoid, deceive and croſs the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Authority of that ſecond Maſter.</p>
                        <p>And ſo we ſee, that being no wiſe inclin'd to favour Children that are in ſome manner <note place="margin">Sponte ſua quae ſe tollunt in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis aur as, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faecunda qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, ſed laeta, &amp; fortia ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt. <hi>Virg.

She relapſes as ſoon as ſhe can, ſhooting vigorouſly <hi>Thiſtles, Nettles,</hi> and a Thouſand other <hi>Plants</hi> of no Uſe to us, which are properly her natural welbelov'd Children.</p>
                        <p>In this the <hi>Earth</hi> reſembles thoſe Children who are ſeldom tired with Voluntary Games and Sports, though never ſo Rough or Violent in themſelves, and yet appear ſoon weary in the performance of what a Superior Authority enjoins them for their good, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo eaſie in the Execution.</p>
                        <p>Thus then, this <hi>Earth</hi> is oblig'd to obey in a great many Things, which Man requires of it, in which perhaps it might be compar'd to a young Colt, Vigorous and Obſtinate, <note place="margin">Loquere terrae, &amp; reſpondebit tibi, &amp;c. <hi>Iob.</hi>
                           </note> which being once ſubjected to the Hand and Spur of an able Rider, becomes ſubſervient for Pleaſures, Combats and Triumphs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I might ſay, that all ſort of <hi>Soils</hi> are not proper for all Sorts of Productions, ſo that every <hi>Clime</hi> ſeems in ſome Sence to be reduc'd to ſome particular Thing, which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <note place="margin">Nec vero terrae ferre omnes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia poſſunt. <hi>Virg. Georg.</hi> 1.</note> happily and with Eaſe; whereas other <hi>Plants</hi> cannot ſucceed in it, without much
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48210:35"/>
Toil and Care: It is in this point that Man ſtands in need of Induſtry, nay even of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, finally to overcome the Reſiſtance he meets with ſometimes, in the <hi>Culture</hi> of his Ground.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe happy or unfortunate Succeſſes of <hi>Plants,</hi> in certain Places ought to inform us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively, what kind of <hi>Earth</hi> is abſolutely fit for every ſort of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for Inſtance, the large <hi>Cherry Trees</hi> of the Vale of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and the fine <hi>Plum Trees</hi> of the Hills of <hi>Meudon, &amp;c.</hi> Inſtruct me what <hi>Soil</hi> is proper for <hi>Cherries,</hi> and what for <hi>Plums, &amp;c.</hi> leaſt I ſhould engage to the rearing of them in <hi>Soils</hi> of a different Temper, with Confidence and Preſumption of ſucceeding without difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I might finally ſay what is known by every Body, that ſome <hi>Earths</hi> are much better than others in every <hi>Climate,</hi> nay even ſometimes in a ſmall Compaſs of <hi>Ground,</hi> vulgarly term'd <hi>Veins of Earth:</hi> For Inſtance, <hi>Wheat</hi> grows well in one Place, and yet cannot grow in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloſe by it, where the <hi>Ground</hi> is only fit for <hi>Rye,</hi> or other ſmall Corn. <hi>Wine</hi> proves good in one Place, and is not ſo in another, tho' cloſe by it. <hi>Muſcadine</hi> ripens perfectly well in ſome, and in others neither acquires Taſte, Firmneſs, Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence it follows, that it is very difficult to give general and poſitive Rules for every <hi>Climate</hi> in general, conſidering the great Proximity or Nearneſs of good <hi>Soil</hi> to bad.</p>
                        <p>So that we ſay in reſpect to the Production of <hi>Earth</hi> in every <hi>Clime,</hi> that ſome are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good, that is, very Fertile, as we have often cauſe to ſay, in reſpect to the ſaid Production, that ſome are very Bad, that is, very Barren: This difference proceeding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently from the Internal Qualifications of every <hi>Ground,</hi> ſince it cannot be imputed to the <hi>Sun,</hi> which looks upon them all with the ſame Eye; it may likewiſe proceed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, which we will demonſtrate hereafter: But, in fine, our <hi>Gardens</hi> abſolutely require <hi>Earth,</hi> therefore let us now examine what Conditions are neceſſary to that <hi>Earth,</hi> in order to make our <hi>Garden</hi> thrive.</p>

                              </p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>Beſides this, the Nature of this <hi>Soil</hi> muſt be ſuch, that it may eaſily repair what has been Impair'd by ſome Extraordinary Accident, <hi>viz.</hi> by a great Heat, or a great Cold; by a great Drought, or great Moiſture; by a long Nouriſhment of ſome Foreign <hi>Plant, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as eaſily and certainly to recover its former Goodneſs, if left in quiet, and, as it were, abandon'd to it ſelf; which ſuppoſes that the Accidents that had troubled it in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Productions ceaſing, the goodneſs of its Nature, and particularly its happy Situation, are apparently the principal Cauſes thereof; which is ſo true, as to that Situation, that ſuch a <hi>Soil</hi> being admirably good in ſuch a Place, will ſoon ceaſe to be ſo, if carried into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where it may not meet with the good Fortune of ſuch an advantageous Situation: Whereas, on the contrary, if Barren in ſome Place, being Tranſported into another, where the Situation happens to be better, it will undoubtedly prove much better in its Production there.</p>
                           <p>This is the Reaſon that Tranſported <hi>Earth,</hi> though never ſo good in the place whence it was brought, only has a Tranſitory Goodneſs, and will ſoon ceaſe to be ſo, not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a proper Situation, in which caſe it will require extraordinary Helps to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in a Fruitful Condition.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we may lay down as a certain Maxim, that no <hi>Earth</hi> can be call'd good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhows a great Fertility by its natural Productions, and be capable to recover it ſelf without help. Thoſe are the <hi>Earths</hi> that are abſolutely neceſſary for <hi>Gardens,</hi> without amuſing our ſelves in hopes of correcting a natural Barrenneſs abſolutely, by laying out a great deal of Money, in <hi>Dunging, &amp;c.</hi> eſpecially in Relation to <hi>Fruits;</hi> as for <hi>Pot-herbs,</hi> I grant, that having abundance of <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> together with ſeveral Indefatigable <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> they may be made to grow in a common <hi>Soil;</hi> but that Remedy is too Expenſive, and the real Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a <hi>Garden,</hi> is inconſiſtent with ſo much Toil and Charge.</p>

                              </p>

                           <p>Moreover, in my Opinion, the real Goodneſs of <hi>Earth</hi> conſiſts in having neither Smell nor Taſte; ſince it would be Vain for our <hi>Fruits</hi> to be the Children of a very Fruitful <hi>Soil,</hi> and to be large and beautiful; if, at the ſame time, that <hi>Soil</hi> had any ill Smell, or ill Taſte, by Reaſon that the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes,</hi> or <hi>Edible Plants,</hi> will infallibly be tainted with it, and conſequently cannot be good or pallatable, which is their main Excellence.</p>
                           <p>The Example of thoſe Wines that taſte of the <hi>Soil,</hi> is a convincing Proof of this Truth, it being moſt certain that the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is prepar'd by the <hi>Roots,</hi> is only made by the Water, which ſoaking in the <hi>Ground</hi> where thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> are to Work, of neceſſity par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates to the Taſte and Qualities of that <hi>Soil,</hi> and ſtill retains them, notwithſtanding its being turn'd into <hi>Sap.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Earth</hi> to be good, muſt be altogether like good Water, that is, that without being Tart, or Inſipid, and Sweetiſh, it muſt have no manner of Smell whatever, neither Good nor Bad.</p>
                           <p>This is the firſt and moſt material Obſervation to be made, in order to Reſolve and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon the <hi>Ground</hi> of a <hi>Garden,</hi> when it appears Fertile; which Obſervation is very eaſie, ſince every Body is capable of making it, either in Smelling barely to a handful of that <hi>Earth,</hi> to judge of the Smell, or in taſting the Water, in which it ſhall have ſoak'd, to judge of its Taſte. For Example, leaving ſome ſmall Quantity to ſoak for Five or Six Hours in a Glaſs, which being afterwards drein'd through a clean Cloath to remove all Suſpition of Dirt or Uncleanneſs, may be taſted, to judge by its good or ill Taſte, of Stink and Tarneſs, or Pleaſantneſs and Sweetneſs, whether that Ground may be proper to produce good <hi>Fruits,</hi> in order to reſolve upon the making or not making a <hi>Garden</hi> there. It is impoſſible to be too Nice in point of Taſte; <hi>Legumes</hi> do not require quite ſo much nicety, by Reaſon that moſt of them, in the boiling, loſe whatever might be diſagreeable in their Taſte.</p>

                           <p>Though it might ſeem ſufficient in order to judge of the Goodneſs of <hi>Earth,</hi> to find its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction Vigorous, and that it does not grow weary of Producing, as alſo that it has no manner of ill Taſte; yet notwithſtanding the Knowledge of our Curious, who will make a <hi>Garden,</hi> muſt extend farther: It is neceſſary to ſound the Depth of the <hi>Ground,</hi> and to dig into its Entrails, to ſee whether it contains, at leaſt, Three Foot of as good <hi>Mould</hi> as the <hi>Surface.</hi> The <hi>Tress</hi> he ſhall plant there will not grow ſo eaſily as thoſe which Nature has produc'd of it ſelf; they will not thrive, unleſs they be, as it were, certain of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Food for the Time to come, which Proviſion conſiſts in having Three Foot of good <hi>Mould,</hi> very ſoft or labourable on the Top; and whereas by daily requiring ſome new thing from that <hi>Earth,</hi> it is tired at laſt, and grows Lazy and Lean in its Productions, it is neceſſary to make ſome Alterations; the moſt material of all which, as well as the moſt eaſie, is to lay the <hi>Mould</hi> that lay in the Bottom on the Top, where not having had any Thing to employ it, it preſerv'd its natural Fruitfulneſs, in Expectation of being put to Tryal, that is, of being Expos'd to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Cultivated;</hi> in which Motion of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Surface</hi> is turn'd in the Room of the other, which was taken up there to lay at reſt in its Turn, in order to come to it ſelf again in ſome Years Time, and to be put into a Condition of acting again as well as ever: Not unlike thoſe Animals, which, though never ſo tired at the end of the firſt Day's Journey, go on the next Day with the ſame Vigour as before, provided they have Reſt in the Night.</p>
                           <p>It is not enough to have laid down as a Maxim, that <hi>Trees</hi> abſolutely require Three Foot in Depth of good <hi>Mould,</hi> it is neceſſary beſides to decide how much will be proper for long Rooted <hi>Legumes:</hi> For Example, <hi>Artichokes, Beet Roots, Scorzonere, Parſneps, Carots, &amp;c.</hi> all which, in my Opinion likewiſe, require the ſame Depth of Three Foot. Other <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Sallads, Greens</hi> and <hi>Cabbage, &amp;c.</hi> may do with a Foot leſs. But thoſe among the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> who, in both caſes, of <hi>Trees</hi> and large <hi>Legumes,</hi> are ſatisfied with leſs Depth than I have Inſtanc'd, are certainly in a very great Error, and are to be pitied, or rather blam'd. They will be liable to have abundance of <hi>Trees</hi> grow Yellow and Sick, and to ſee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of them Periſh, and conſequently will be obliged to a new Expence, to plant others at a Time when, after Five or Six Years Patience, they ought to Enjoy the Benefit of their <hi>Plants.</hi> And laſtly, they will be Expos'd to have ſmall <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Legumes,</hi> and thoſe neither good nor come to perfection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Inconveniencies ought to be avoided, by following of my Precepts in chuſing of a ſufficient Depth.</p>

                           <p>The beſt way to know eaſie <hi>Mould,</hi> is to compare it with other <hi>Earth</hi> that is not ſo; for Example:</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Earth</hi> that is too ſtrong cuts with the Spade like loamy or ſtif Ground, which are apt to cloſe and grow hard, to that degree, that it is almoſt impoſſible for Rain, or Waterings to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate or ſoak into them, wich is a very vexatious and moſt pernicious Inconvenience for <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> beſides, they are naturally inclin'd to rottenneſs, and are cold and backward, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a continual moiſture in their bottom, three of the worſt Qualifications <hi>Earth</hi> can have; the ſurface of them eaſily ſplits and parches in great heats, inſomuch that they are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving the leaſt <hi>Culture,</hi> and conſequently are neither fit for new <hi>Plantations,</hi> or to receive new <hi>Seeds,</hi> which occaſions a great ſcarcity in moſt Seaſons; beſides, thoſe cranys are very prejudicial both to <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> having already taken new <hi>Root,</hi> by uncovering the <hi>Roots,</hi> breaking the new ones, and hindering them from continuing their Functions.</p>
                           <p>It is impoſſible to be better inform'd than I am, with all the diſorders that attend ſuch Soils, and with all the Inconveniencies they cauſe in <hi>Culture;</hi> and therefore I think it will not be improper for me to make a ſhort Relation, by the by, of what I have been oblig'd to do in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>Verſailles;</hi> of which the <hi>Earth</hi> is partly of the Nature of thoſe, which it were to be wiſh'd, might not be met with any where, and which we would not have there, had it been eaſie to bring better in the room of it. The Neceſſity of making a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> in a Situation proper for Walks, and the King's Satisfaction, oblig'd us to pitch upon that Place where it is; and the difficulty of meeting with extraordinary good <hi>Earth</hi> in the adjacent Parts, neceſſitated us to be ſatisfied with ſuch as was paſſably good.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> is in a Place, where there was formerly a large and very deep Pond; we were oblig'd to fill up the Place of that Pond, and raiſe the Surface of it even above that of the Grounds about it, otherwiſe it being a Marſh, and the ſink of the neighbouring Hills, it would never have ſucceeded for the uſe it was deſign'd to: we met with no great difficulty in the filling of it, by means of the Sands we were oblig'd to dig out to make the adjacent Canal, of which we us'd ten and twelve Foot in depth every where, but yet the difficulty of meeting with proper <hi>Mould</hi> to lay over thoſe Sands, and to have it ſpeedily, together with the Expence and Time for the diſtant Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the great quantity that was neceſſary for the ſurface of near twenty five Acres, or Furlongs, were capable to diſcourage any body from the Enterpriſe; therefore we were oblig'd to take that which lay neareſt to us, that is from the Mountain of <hi>Satory:</hi> I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it upon the ſpot, and found that it was a kind of loamy Ground which turn'd to Pap or Mortar, when after great Rains the Water remain'd long upon it, and look'd as if it had been petrify'd when it was dry; I likewiſe perceiv'd that common Showrs did not eaſily ſoak into it, which troubled me much, but I imputed the cauſe of it to a kind of white Sand, or ſoft and chalkey Stone, which was found upon that Mountain at the ſecond ſpit deep of the Spade, and comforted my ſelf in hopes of meeting with a Remedy againſt it, by means of the Sands, upon which that <hi>Earth</hi> was to be plac'd; upon that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation I diſpos'd the ground of this <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> in ſuch a manner that the <hi>Earth</hi> of the ſurface might lay upon a level, without any declivity, as commonly moſt <hi>Gardens</hi> are; but I was extreamly ſurpriz'd when I found the contrary of what I expected; this <hi>Earth</hi> in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Place, did not change its Nature, it remain'd impenetrable to Water; that which happen'd moſt favourable to me in this, was, that I was expos'd the firſt year to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchief that could poſſibly befall me, there falling ſuch great and frequent Showers of Rain, that the whole <hi>Garden</hi> ſeem'd to be turn'd into a Pond, or at leaſt into a puddled Marſh, which was inacceſſible, and above all, Mortal, both for the <hi>Trees</hi> that were root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and all the <hi>Kitchen Plants</hi> that were overflow'd by it: A Remedy was to be found ſuitable to ſo great an Inconvenience, otherwiſe the great work of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> the Expence of which had made ſo great a Noiſe, and the Figure whereof afforded ſo much Pleaſure, ſhould have been of no uſe: Happily in cauſing this ſame <hi>Garden</hi> to be made, I had at the ſame time alſo made an <hi>Aqueduct</hi> that went a croſs it, in order to receive all the Waters of the Hills, which were wont to fall into that very Place to ſupply the former Pond, and were neceſſary to fill the great neighbouring Canal; therefore I bethought my ſelf to order Matters ſo, that thoſe Waters which were ſo pernicious to me, might loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that great <hi>Aqueduct,</hi> to which end I thought my ſelf oblig'd to raiſe every Plat or

Square into Ridges, which Remedy was good, but would have been violent, had I been forc'd to get new <hi>Earth</hi> for that Elevation; in order to perform this with more eaſe, I made uſe of long <hi>Dung,</hi> of which I was very well provided, as well to place it underneath, as to mix it with the <hi>Mould</hi> deſign'd for <hi>Legumes,</hi> which anſwer'd my Expectation. The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs prov'd good, and the Charge inconſiderable; in forming of this Work, I allow'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Square an imperceptible Declivity to lead or carry all the Waters ſliding down from all the parts ſo rais'd into one of the Corners; and caus'd a ſmall Stone Gutter to be made at every Corner, to carry thoſe Waters into the <hi>Aqueducts;</hi> and was not long before I found the benefit of that Invention; my Squares with their <hi>Plants,</hi> and my Borders with their <hi>Trees,</hi> being thereby preſerv'd according to my Wiſh; beſides, it contributed conſiderably towards the Preſervation and good Taſte of all the things that I could rear there.</p>
                           <p>This manner of Ridges appear'd at firſt ſurprizing by its Novelty, but yet it had the good Fortune to pleaſe the King, whoſe Penetration and Judgment are infinite in all things; What Honour, and what Joy for me to have the Approbation of ſo great a Prince! He judg'd that the Invention was no leſs agreeable than new, ſo much the rather, becauſe it was of the greateſt uſe imaginable; beſides, it added three Acres to the firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Garden.</hi> I do not queſtion but this Method of Ridges will be imitated in all Places where the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall be either like ours, or liable to the Inundation of great Rains, or naturally too Marſhy.</p>
                           <p>But when People have no Inclination to make ſuch Elevations, they muſt at leaſt reſolve to have recourſe to frequent <hi>Tillages,</hi> to avoid the Inconveniencies that attend Soils that eaſily Chop in the time of great long heats, it being a very good and infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>

                           <p>We have now ſeen the Inconveniencies attending a <hi>Soil</hi> that is too ponderous, or too fat, and too ſtrong, and have found a Remedy for it; on the other hand, thoſe that are too light, and conſequently dry, are accompany'd with ſo many difficulties, that they are capable wholly to diſguſt the Curious.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the difficulty of a neceſſary Remedy: <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the neceſſity of great and frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> which are very chargeable, and without which the <hi>Earth</hi> grows, or remains <hi>Barren: Thirdly,</hi> By the ſmall Progreſs of <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes,</hi> there during the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> without extraordinary helps: Laſtly, by the ſmall number of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with it in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> in which not withſtanding it is neceſſary to have them of all kinds to be fully ſatisfied.</p>
                           <p>Let us now conſider what relates to thoſe <hi>Soils</hi> that are too dry and light, and let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin whether it be poſſible to correct thoſe defects.</p>
                           <p>It happens often that <hi>Earth</hi> is dry and light, becauſe Nature at firſt formed it in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, ſuch is that of <hi>dry Turf</hi> in certain <hi>Fens,</hi> ſuch is the <hi>Sandy Soil</hi> of the Plain of <hi>Grenelle;</hi> it is pretty difficult, tho not impoſſible to render them more Ponderous and Fat, which is only to be done by mixing abundance of other ſtrong <hi>Earth</hi> among it, or by making of a way for a conſiderable diſcharge of <hi>Water</hi> towards the <hi>Bottom,</hi> which might ſpread all over it, which is not very practicable; ſometimes this drought and lightneſs proceed from its lying upon a <hi>clear Sand,</hi> eſpecially when it lyes too ſhallow, and conſequently has not a Bed ſufficiently ſolid, and cloſe, to ſtop the <hi>Waters</hi> that fall upon it, either by <hi>Rain, Snow,</hi> or other ways; thoſe <hi>Waters</hi> eaſily penetrating the Body of thoſe <hi>Soils</hi> deſcend to that Sand, which being as it were, a kind of Sive lets them paſs, and go down lower, as to the place of their Center, whither their weight inclines them, and ſo no <hi>Moiſture</hi> or <hi>Coolneſs</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the Bottom of that <hi>Earth,</hi> from thence to be Communicated to the ſuperior parts; and conſequently that <hi>Soil</hi> ſtill relapſes into its Natural <hi>Drineſs</hi> and <hi>Barrenneſs,</hi> ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce any thing, unleſs it be at once accompanied with ſome <hi>Moiſture</hi> and <hi>Temperate</hi>

                           <p>Thoſe that are at liberty to chooſe their <hi>Ground,</hi> will hardly be ſo ill adviſed as to pitch upon one that is ſo defective; but when they are indiſpenſably obliged to it, three things muſt of neceſſity be done.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is to remove as much of that <hi>Clear Sand</hi> as will be neceſſary to form that depth of <hi>three Foot,</hi> filling it up afterwards with as good <hi>Mould</hi> as can be conveniently got.</p>

The <hi>Second</hi> is to keep all thoſe Places that are to be <hi>Cultivated</hi> a little lower than the Walks, to the End that the Waters which falls into thoſe Walks, may altogether incline and run into that <hi>Ground.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and Laſt is to throw into thoſe <hi>Cultivated Plats,</hi> in the Winter, all the Snow that lies in the <hi>Walks,</hi> and other Parts, from which they may be eaſily brought, which will make a Proviſion of Moiſture in the Bottom of that <hi>Ground,</hi> to help it to perform its Functions during the great Heats of Summer.</p>
                           <p>I have always us'd thoſe three Expedients, and have prevail'd with my Friends to put them in practice; and I atteſt with Truth, that we have all found a great Benefit by it, and that it is very ſafe to put them in practice.</p>
                           <p>No Body can be Ignorant, that when there lies Water at a moderate Depth within the <hi>Ground;</hi> for Inſtance, about Three Foot deep (which is common at the Bottom of <hi>Vales,</hi> where there lies what we call a good <hi>Black Sand.)</hi> No Body, I ſay, can be Ignorant, that in ſuch a Caſe a Natural <hi>Philtration</hi> or <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> forms it ſelf in the Depth of that <hi>Earth,</hi> which raiſes part of that Water up to the <hi>Surface,</hi> which preſerving or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Earth</hi> in a good Temperature for <hi>Production,</hi> makes it extraordinary good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the Contrary, that Water lying in a great quantity too near the Surface; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, within a Foot or ſomewhat more, being ſtop'd there by ſome Bank of ſoft <hi>Chalk, Stone,</hi> or ſtiff <hi>Clay</hi> remains there, being hindred from deſcending lower, and thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions too great a Moiſture in the <hi>Earth;</hi> ſo that unleſs a Diſcharge be made of thoſe Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Waters, or that the <hi>Ground</hi> be rais'd <hi>Ridgewiſe,</hi> as I have heretofore Explain'd, in order to make thoſe Waters riſe, ſuch <hi>Soil</hi> will of Neceſſity grow Cold, Rotten; and, in a Word, ſtark Nought.</p>
                           <p>And, indeed, we may aſſure our ſelves, that the Moiſture of <hi>Soils</hi> often proceeds from that Cauſe, as well thoſe that are very Exceſſive as thoſe that are not: That Moiſture proceeds ſometimes from other Cauſes, as we ſhall declare in the Sequel.</p>
                           <p>I think my ſelf oblig'd to ſay in this Place, that in Relation to the difference of <hi>Earth,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Strong and Fat, or Dry and Light, this Diſtinction is to be made, that in Cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries light <hi>Earth</hi> is moſt to be deſir'd, to the End that a ſmall Heat may be able to warm it; whereas pretty Stony and Fat <hi>Soil</hi> is beſt in Hot Countries, Heat not penetrating ſo eaſily into the Bottom of it, or drying up the <hi>Plants.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Poets,</hi> who was Originally <note place="margin">At quae pinguis humus, dulcique uligine laeta, quique frequens herbis &amp; fertilis ubere campus. <hi>Georg. 2. &amp; paulo poſt.</hi> Hic tibi praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas olim, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toque fluentes ſufficiet Baccho vites hic fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis uvae, &amp;c. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.

                           <p>There are ſome <hi>Soils</hi> of ſo equal a Temperature, and ſo advantageous a Conſtitution, that all manner of <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> of any kind whatever ſucceed incomparably well in them; nay, which is more, thoſe kind of <hi>Soils</hi> receiving but a common <hi>Culture</hi> of ordinary Labour, or ſtirring of the <hi>Ground</hi> for <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> preſerve themſelves good for many Years, without the Aſſiſtance of any Amendments, unleſs it be for <hi>Legumes.</hi>

In the ſame manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Fruitfulneſs <hi>Earth</hi> is endu'd with, it will waſte at length by the Abundance of its Productions, I mean ſuch as have been forc'd upon it, but not thoſe that are natural and voluntary, wherewith it ſeems only to ſport; for Inſtance, the <hi>Ground</hi> of a good <hi>Meadow</hi> is ſo far from waſting, by the Nouriſhment it affords the Graſs it yearly produces, that it improves in its Diſpoſition of producing it, as if it delighted in following its natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; but when we go about to alter its Function, and force it to produce <hi>Saint Foin, Wheat,</hi> or any other Corn that is a Stranger to it, it will be ſoon perceiv'd, firſt, that it begins to ſlacken in its Production, and finally Exhauſts or Spends it ſelf, inſomuch, that it will want ſome help to be put again in Vigour, otherwiſe it will remain for a time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt uſeleſs. It may be alſo, that the <hi>Grounds</hi> where <hi>Wheat</hi> and other Corn grow of themſelves (for it is very probable, that thoſe firſt Grains grew naturally and without any Induſtry in ſome <hi>Soils.)</hi> It may be, I ſay, that thoſe Corn <hi>Grounds</hi> might be worn out ſooner in producing of Hey, than in the Continuance of their Natural Productions: So that it is Evident by the Experience of all <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> that <hi>Earth</hi> frequently wears out or exhauſts.</p>
                           <p>I add, that according to the greater or leſſer quantity of Salt, every particular <hi>Plant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, all <hi>Plants</hi> not conſuming an equal quantity of it, that <hi>Earth</hi> which is abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided therewith, ſhoots, without wearing out ſo ſoon, ſeveral different kind of <hi>Plants,</hi> and ſometimes all of them together and at the ſame time, witneſs the good <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Meadows,</hi> every part of which abounds with an Infinity of different <hi>Plants,</hi> all equally Vigorous: Sometimes, and that only when the <hi>Ground</hi> is indifferently good, that <hi>Earth</hi> only produces many ſucceſſively the one after the other; as we ſee by ſmall <hi>Corn,</hi> as <hi>Barly, Oates, &amp;c.</hi> which are ſown in thoſe very <hi>Grounds</hi> that have juſt before produced <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Rye;</hi> which, though not capable of producing ſome of the like ſo ſoon after it, have yet the Force of producing ſmaller.</p>

Thus Philoſophers impute to the Air an Elaſtic Force, and to uſe a more ſenſible Example. Thus Water has in it ſelf a kind of Natural Coolneſs with a Principle of re-eſtabliſhing, and reproducing that Coolneſs, when after its having been heated by Fire, or by the Sun, it is remov'd out of their Reach: Heat is certainly a ſtranger to it, and, as it were, an Enemy; ſo that it keeps this Water in a violent Motion; But when 'tis remov'd from that which caus'd and maintain'd that Heat, and thereby left at Reſt, it deſtroys that which render'd it defective, and by degrees becomes cool again as before; that is, it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the perfection, which is natural to its Being and Temper.</p>

This Expedient of Tranſporting <hi>Earth</hi> is ſeldom practis'd, but when a <hi>Garden</hi> is to be made in a Place that has none, which does not happen often, at leaſt where great <hi>Gardens</hi> are to be made, or when we deſign to fill up ſome Trenches, which we have cauſe to believe worn out; in which caſes <hi>Earth</hi> muſt be ſent for from Places where it is very good.

                           <p>Good <hi>Earth</hi> ſeems to meet with a kind of Improvement in that Tranſportation, which is the Reaſon that People ſay, Such and ſuch a <hi>Garden</hi> cannot be Ill, ſince it is altogether compos'd of <hi>Tranſported Earth.</hi> The Reaſon of this Improvement by Tranſporting, is as difficult to be ſolv'd, as that of the <hi>Amendment</hi> which proceeds from the Burning of Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

We have a particular value for it, and indeed cannot have too much, ſince it is certain that this <hi>New Soil</hi> poſſeſſes not only all the firſt Salt, which was given it at the Moment of the Creation; but alſo the Major Part of the Salt of the Surface, which was preſs'd down to the Bottom by Rains and Waterings, the Weight of which made it deſcend where-ever it could penetrate. This <hi>Salt</hi> preſerves it ſelf in thoſe hidden <hi>Earths,</hi> until they become a <hi>Surface</hi> themſelves, and then the Air gives them a proper diſpoſition to employ with Glory that Fertility wherewith they are Endu'd; and indeed they are no ſooner at Liberty to Act, but they produce <hi>Vegetables</hi> of a ſurpriſing Beauty.</p>
                           <p>It is not difficult to apprehend what <hi>New Mould</hi> is, all <hi>Earths</hi> were ſo Originally, that is, at the Moment of their Creation, God by his Command having beſtow'd upon them the Gift of the Faculty of <hi>Production,</hi> which till then had not been put in Uſe. From that time none of the <hi>Earth</hi> of the Surface of that Terreſtrial Body or Maſs, can be called <hi>New,</hi> ſince all thoſe that were capable of Producing, have not ceas'd to Act hitherto: But whereas there are many Places, where the Bottom of that <hi>Earth,</hi> within Two or Three Foot of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, has always remain'd without Action, and others where that very Surface has not been allowed to Act, both the one and the other afford us <hi>New Earth,</hi> to make uſe of in our Neceſſities: So that by <hi>New Earth</hi> we mean ſuch as never ſerv'd towards the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any <hi>Plant.</hi> For Inſtance, ſuch as lies Three Foot beneath the Surface, and from thence as low as it can go, provided it be really <hi>Earth,</hi> or elſe we mean ſuch as having already nouriſh'd ſeveral <hi>Plants,</hi> has afterwards been long without nouriſhing any others; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuch as has been built upon. We ſay, and that by Experience, that in the firſt Year, both the one and the other of theſe <hi>Earths</hi> are wonderfully good, eſpecially for our <hi>Gardens,</hi> all manner of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Legumes</hi> Improving, Growing and Thickning viſibly in them: And when we plant <hi>Trees</hi> in them, provided they be good in themſelves, and be well planted, few of them Miſcarry; whereas in thoſe that are naught, or really worn out, the greateſt part of them Die, though never ſo well condition'd, or ſo carefully planted.</p>
                           <p>The Eyes are not capable to diſtinguiſh whether <hi>Earth</hi> be new or worn out, that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt proceed from other Things, the one and the other being extreamly alike; and it might be ſaid with Reaſon, that thoſe <hi>Earths</hi> that are bad, whether they have always been ſo, or are grown ſo, are not unlike Gun-Powder, which being bad, or having taken Vent, cannot take Fire, and yet looks altogether like that which is good. Thus <hi>Earth,</hi> that is naturally naught and barren, or having been good is worn out, not having any thing within it to animate it, when it receives heat and moiſture, remains as if it were dead, notwithſtanding a Succours which would animate any other <hi>Earth;</hi> ſo that not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing in the leaſt to the Action of the old <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> they at laſt rot, and together with them the whole Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> as I have fully Explain'd in my Reflections upon the Beginning of <hi>Vegetation.</hi>

                           <p>I have declar'd ſeveral Times already, That the moſt eſſential and ſureſt Mark of the goodneſs of the <hi>Ground,</hi> is that which is taken from the Natural Beauty of its Productions; ſome would willingly beſides this, ſettle another certain mark upon the Colour of it, and ſay, that a blackiſh Grey is a convincing Proof in that matter, beſides its being moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Eye.</p>
                           <p>This Queſtion has not only been debated in our Days; the great Authors of Antiquity <note place="margin">Nigra fere &amp; preſſo pinguis ſub vomere ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> have made ſome Reflections upon it before us; for my part I am not in the leaſt prejudic'd in this Point, having ſeen good and bad <hi>Earth</hi> of all Colours: But yet it is certain that this blackiſh Grey, which pleaſes moſt, and has deſerv'd the Approbation of former Ages, is commonly in that reſpect one of the beſt Signs of goodneſs, though not Infallible. We often meet with Rediſh and Whitiſh <hi>Earth</hi> that are Incomparable, but ſeldom any that is quite White deſerving that Character. We likewiſe meet with ſome that is Black, either at the Top of ſome Hills, or in certain Vales, which are very barren; it being a kind of dead Sand, which can at moſt only produce Broom and Furrs.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we muſt conclude, that the true mark to judge of the Goodneſs of <hi>Mould,</hi> is neither the Colour nor Depth of it; ſince nothing but the fine Production it naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords can do it, they only can decide in that Point. For Inſtance, in the open Fields we may judge by the goodneſs of the Graſs, which Cattle willingly feeds on; by the <hi>Brambles, Briers, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> by the Size of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> large <hi>Lettuces</hi> and <hi>Sorrel, &amp;c.</hi> But more eſpecially, as has been ſaid already by the Vigour of the <hi>Trees,</hi> their long <hi>Shoots,</hi> the large Size and flouriſhing Verdure of the <hi>Leaves, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe marks we may look upon as undeniable Proofs and Witneſſes, upon whoſe Depoſition we may abſolutely rely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truſting to any other. The Size of <hi>Fruits</hi> may be look'd upon as ſomething in that Caſe, but is no Infallible Argument, ſince we commonly ſee large <hi>Fruit</hi> upon weak <hi>Trees</hi> and ſome very ſmall upon others that are more Vigorous.

                        <p>There is a diſtinction to be made, <hi>viz.</hi> whether in relation to a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of <hi>Fruit,</hi> excepting ſuch as are Red, as <hi>Strawberries, Raſpberries, Cherries, Currans,</hi> which compoſe part of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> or only to <hi>Fruit-Gardens</hi> without any <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumes;</hi> it happens ſometimes that the <hi>Fruit-Garden</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> are made aſunder; or, in fine, this <hi>Garden</hi> being compos'd both of the one and the other.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Caſe, which relates to a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> without doubt little Valleys or Dales are to be preferr'd to all other Situations, and commonly have all that is to be deſir'd in a good Ground; they are fit for Excellent <hi>Meadows,</hi> the <hi>Moulds</hi> is eaſie and apparently of a ſufficient depth, it is fatten'd with all that is good upon the Neighbouring Hills.

Red <hi>Fruit</hi> acquire in it that Sweetneſs and Size which renders them recommendable: Waterings are eaſie at hand, Springs and Brooks being ſeldom wanting there; but then they are liable to a great Inconvenience, by Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                           <p>Of the Expoſures of <hi>Gardens,</hi> as well in general as in particular; with the Explication of what may be good and ill in every one of them.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is not enough for a <hi>Garden</hi> to have a good <hi>Ground,</hi> and to be well ſituated, it muſt alſo be well expos'd; and a ſmall riſing not being well expos'd, cannot be call'd an advantagious <hi>Situation.</hi> There are four ſorts of Expoſitions, the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the <hi>South,</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> all eaſily known by the Names that have been given them, with this difference, that among <hi>Gard'ners</hi> theſe Terms ſignifie the clean contrary of what they do among <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Geographers;</hi> theſe only regarding thoſe Parts, where the <hi>Sun</hi> actually appears, and not thoſe which are lighten'd by his <hi>Beams;</hi> for Inſtance, by <hi>Eaſt</hi> they mean that part where the <hi>Sun</hi> Riſes, by <hi>Weſt</hi> the part where it Sets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> only conſider thoſe parts of their <hi>Garden</hi> upon which the <hi>Sun</hi> directly ſhines, and in what manner it ſhines upon it throughout the courſe of the day, either in relation to the whole <hi>Garden,</hi> or only in relation to ſome of the ſides of it; for Example, as to the ſides, when the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> ſee the <hi>Sun</hi> at his Riſing, and during all the firſt half of the day continue to ſhine upon one ſide, they call that ſide the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and indeed it is really the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Gardens;</hi> ſo that when the <hi>Sun</hi> begins to appear later upon it, or to remove ſooner from it, it can no longer be call'd <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and by the ſame reaſon they call that ſide the <hi>Weſt,</hi> upon which the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines all the ſecond half part of the day, that is from Noon till Night, and according to the ſame way of ſpeaking, they call that part <hi>South,</hi> where the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines from above nine in the Morning till Evening, or elſe that part where it ſhines longeſt in the whole day, whatever hour it begins at, or removes from it; in fine, they call that <hi>North</hi> which is oppoſite to the <hi>South,</hi> and conſequently that part which is leaſt favour'd by the Rays of the <hi>Sun;</hi> for perhaps it does not receive the benefit of it above one hour or two
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48210:41"/>
in the Morning, and the ſame at Night. This is the true meaning of Expoſures in point of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and particularly in relation to the Walls of <hi>Gardens,</hi> whereby may be underſtood the meaning of that manner of ſpeaking ſo common among <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> my <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> are better than thoſe of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> my <hi>Wall Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> are not ſo often water'd <note place="margin">Triſte Lupus ſtabulis, matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris frugibus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, arboribus venti, &amp;c. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. buc.

                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, thoſe Names of Expoſitions likewiſe expreſs thoſe Winds <hi>Gardens</hi> are more, or leſs expos'd to, and conſequently can be more or leſs prejudicial to them; for the Winds in reſpect to <hi>Gardens,</hi> eſpecially for <hi>Trees,</hi> are almoſt all to be fear'd; but yet ſome more, and others leſs, and that according to the different Seaſons of the Year.</p>
                        <p>Although it may be urg'd, that whatever Situation a <hi>Garden</hi> be in, it has of neceſſity all the Aſpects of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and conſequently is in a Condition to enjoy the Favors of all the Expoſitions, as well as to fear the Inſults of all the Winds, yet every body agrees, that ſome are better expos'd than others; which is particularly underſtood of ſuch as are upon Hills, or the ſides of Mountains, of which ſome have the Riſing <hi>Sun,</hi> others the Setting; ſome lye <hi>South,</hi> and others <hi>North;</hi> for as to the <hi>Gardens</hi> that are ſituated in Plains, and are neither cover'd by Mountains, or high Woods, or lofty Buildings, the difference of thoſe Expoſures is not ſo ſenſible.</p>
                        <p>The uſual manner of ſpeaking to expreſs the Expoſitions in reſpect of every <hi>Garden,</hi> in the whole, and without any particular diſtinction of ſides, muſt be underſtood in relation to the Expoſitions of the whole coaſt where thoſe <hi>Gardens</hi> are ſituated; as the manner of ſpeaking of the Expoſures of Walls in particular, relates to the manner of the <hi>Suns</hi> ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon every one of them in the courſe of the whole day; and ſo for Example, when in ſpeaking of a <hi>Garden</hi> ſituated upon a ſmall Hill, we ſay that it lyes to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> we mean that the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines upon it as ſoon as it Riſes, and ſhines but little upon it in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: and when we ſay that a <hi>Garden</hi> lyes full <hi>South,</hi> it is when the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines upon it all the day, or at leaſt from Nine or Ten in the Morning till the Evening; and by the ſame reaſon when we ſay that ſuch a <hi>Garden</hi> lyes to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> we mean that the <hi>Sun</hi> does not begin to ſhine upon it till about Noon, and remains there till it ſets.</p>
                        <p>Now the meaning of Expoſitions is fully underſtood, in order to decide which is the beſt of the four, either in general for the whole <hi>Garden,</hi> or in particular for every one of the ſides; it will be fit to know in the firſt place, that thoſe of the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Eaſt,</hi> are by the Opinion of all <hi>Gard'ners</hi> the two chief, and therefore to be preferr'd before the two others; it is likewiſe fit to know that the Expoſition of the <hi>Weſt</hi> is not amiſs, or at leaſt much better than the <hi>North,</hi> which conſequently is the worſt of all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> In order to decide between the two firſt, which is the beſt, the temper of the <hi>Earth</hi> muſt firſt be diſtinguiſh'd; for if it be ſtrong, and conſequently cold, the <hi>South</hi> is beſt; but if light, and conſequently hot, that of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> will be moſt favourable.</p>
                        <p>The Expoſures of the <hi>South</hi> in all <hi>Earths</hi> is commonly proper to ſecure all <hi>Plants</hi> againſt the rigors of the Winter, to give a taſte to the <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and to forward all that is to be early in all <hi>Seaſons;</hi> and therefore ſince it is favourable to all ſorts of <hi>Earth,</hi> it muſt be ſo particularly to a ſtrong cold <hi>Earth,</hi> which can hardly act unleſs animated by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heat from the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is the moſt proper Expoſition for it: but not for light <hi>Earths,</hi> eſpecially in hot <hi>Climats,</hi> it being apt to ſcorch the <hi>Plants</hi> in <hi>Summer</hi> to that degree, that the <hi>Kitchen Gardens</hi> become of no uſe, it engenders a thouſand <hi>Emots</hi> or kind of <hi>Fleas</hi> which gnaw and wrinkle the <hi>Leaves,</hi> it hinders the <hi>Fruits</hi> from growing to that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they ſhould do, and thereby leſſens the goodneſs of the <hi>Taſte,</hi> and even often makes them drop before their time, which happens ſometimes by reaſon that it ſpoils or drys up the <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> nay even the ſtalks of thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> as we often ſee it in <hi>Muſctts</hi> and <hi>Peaches;</hi> and ſometimes alſo in over-hard'ning the <hi>Rine</hi> of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> even to that degree that it often ſcorches and chaps them; by which means abundance of <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Figs</hi> growing againſt Walls periſh through exceſſive heats: therefore it is eaſie to decide the choice of thoſe two Expoſitions, in reſpect to the difference of <hi>Earth;</hi> the <hi>South</hi> is moſt deſirable in cold moiſt parts, but not ſo much in dry ſandy <hi>Grounds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Generally ſpeaking, this Expoſition of the <hi>South</hi> is free from the <hi>Northern</hi> Winds, which by their uſual coldneſs are always cruel and fatal to all manner of <hi>Gardens,</hi> which is the reaſon it is generally choſen before that of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> but yet it is moſt certain that in light <hi>Grounds,</hi> the laſt being favour'd by Night Dews, and the firſt gentle and mild Rays of the <hi>Riſing Sun,</hi> is incomparable for Maturity, Size and Taſte, as well as for the Preſervation of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Legumes, &amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially becauſe over and above all this, it defends us from the <hi>North Weſt</hi> Winds; that Wind riſes between the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> and as it regularly blows in the Spring, it is commonly attended by white <hi>Froſts,</hi> which are very deſtructive to the <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> whereon it lights, which is the reaſon that People ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48210:41"/>
bear with that <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Expoſition even in ſtrong <hi>Earths,</hi> but ſtill I do certainly believe it beſt for light <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although I have preferr'd the Expoſition of the <hi>Weſt</hi> before that of the <hi>North</hi> without any heſitation, the laſt being certainly the worſt of the two; yet in thoſe <hi>Climats</hi> where the heat being exceſſive, burns, and abſolutely ruins all that is too long expos'd to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>North</hi> ought to be choſen before the other; ſince our <hi>Gardens</hi> only want a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat to nouriſh gentle what they produce, eſpecially to conduct <hi>Fruits</hi> to a perfect <hi>Maturity,</hi> and therefore in thoſe <hi>Climats</hi> where the <hi>Sun</hi> ſeems too violent, I ſhould rather affect a <hi>Northern</hi> Expoſition, having but four or five hours of <hi>Riſing Sun,</hi> and as much of the <hi>Setting</hi> as any other, whether that which ſcorches it all the Day, or that which ſhines upon it but half the Day: And certainly thoſe kind of hot <hi>Climats</hi> are not in the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on the <hi>South</hi> Walls for any of our kernel, or ſtone <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are too tender for it, they are only proper for <hi>Orange Trees, Citron Trees, Pomegranets, Figs,</hi> and <hi>Muſcats Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> of which the greateſt part of the <hi>Leaves</hi> muſt be kept upon the <hi>Trees;</hi> the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions will be good enough, for thoſe tender <hi>Fruits</hi> which cannot bear that of the <hi>South.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After having examin'd the Advantages that may be expected from good Expoſitions, let us now conſider the Inconveniences that may be fear'd from them; but whereas they are not infallibly attended with them, we muſt indeed be prepar'd to bear them, but not diſcomforted when they happen, ſeeing the impoſſibility of a Remedy.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Southern</hi> Expoſition generally ſpeaking is ſubject to great Winds from the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the middle of <hi>October,</hi> which often blow down the <hi>Fruit,</hi> ſome before their being ripe and full grown, and others after their being ripe, which are quite bruis'd by the fall; and thus the beſt part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> periſhes, inſtead of performing its duty, which is to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and recompence the Maſter of the <hi>Garden;</hi> for which reaſon, in ſuch <hi>Gardens</hi> directly expos'd to the <hi>Southern</hi> Winds, which otherwiſe enjoy the Advantages that are ſo much valu'd in <hi>Gard'ning, Wall Trees</hi> are moſt proper; <hi>Dwarfs</hi> alſo defend themſelves pretty well, but <hi>Standards</hi> are to be pitty'd, eſpecially ſuch whoſe <hi>Fruit</hi> does not ſtick faſt to the Stalk, for inſtance, <hi>Virgoules, Vertelongues,</hi> the St. <hi>Germains, &amp;c.</hi> which are not ſo proper for thoſe Expoſures, as thoſe that have the power to reſiſt better the violence of the Winds; for Example, the <hi>Thorn Pears,</hi> the <hi>Ambrets</hi> and <hi>Liſchalſerie,</hi> the <hi>dry Martins, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe ſtick to the Summer <hi>Fruits</hi> which are good at the time of their fall, as the <hi>Lady Thighs,</hi> the ſmall <hi>Muſcat Pears,</hi> the <hi>Blanquets,</hi> or whole <hi>Pears,</hi> the <hi>Robins,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſelets</hi> or <hi>Ruſſetings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Expoſure, though otherwiſe incomparable, has its Imperfections too ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; In the <hi>Spring</hi> it is ſubject to <hi>North Eaſt</hi> Winds, which are dry, cold Winds that wither the <hi>Leaves</hi> and new <hi>Shoots,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> they likewiſe often blow down abundance of <hi>Kernel</hi> and <hi>ſtone Fruit,</hi> and particularly young <hi>Figs,</hi> at the time that by a reaſonable ſize they began to give great hopes of plenty; thoſe Winds are not the only Enemies to that Expoſition, that which likewiſe is fatal to it, eſpecially for the <hi>Eaſtern Wall Trees,</hi> is the not enjoying the benefit of <hi>Rains,</hi> which ſeldom coming but from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> cannot reach the foot of the Walls, whereby the <hi>Trees</hi> are lyable to a mortal drought, unleſs it be remedy'd by the Expedients explain'd in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Wall Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Weſtern</hi> Expoſure not only dreads <hi>North Weſt</hi> Winds in the Spring, which are ſo pernicious for <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> and in <hi>Autumn</hi> the Winds of that Seaſon, thoſe great throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers down of <hi>Fruit,</hi> but alſo, and that particularly in moiſt cold <hi>Grounds,</hi> the great <hi>Rains,</hi> which being commonly very frequent from the parts where the <hi>Sun</hi> Sets, often cauſes great Deſolations there; whereas on the oher hand, in dry light <hi>Earths,</hi> thoſe kind of ſhowers repair the defects of ſterility, and amend the Diſorders caus'd by too much drought.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Northern</hi> Expoſition in relation to <hi>Wall Fruit Trees,</hi> if on the one ſide it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for all Summer <hi>Fruits,</hi> and for ſome in <hi>Autumn,</hi> on the other ſide, it is very dangerous for the beauty and good taſte of thoſe of the <hi>Winter;</hi> but then again, it is the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious that can be during the great heats for <hi>Legumes</hi> and <hi>Red Fruits,</hi> which we would make to hold out, as <hi>Straw-berries, Rasberries, Currans,</hi> &amp;c. I have likewiſe explain'd this matter at large in the Treatiſe of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> as well as in the uſe that is to be made of every particular Wall in a <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Finally,</hi> The reſult of this ſmall Treatiſe about the Expoſition, is that all of them have their Perfections and Imperfections; we muſt endeavour to take our advantage of the firſt, and uſe all our Induſtry to defend our ſelves from the laſt.</p>

                        <p>Beſides, whatever <hi>Rain</hi> may fall, which indeed may be favourable to ſmall <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Strawberries, Greens, Peaſe, Beans, Sallad, Onions, &amp;c.</hi> There are ſtill other <hi>Plants</hi> in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> which require ſomething more, for Example, <hi>Artichoks</hi> of a year or two's growth, which muſt be water'd regularly two or three times a week, a Pitcher at a time to every <hi>Foot;</hi> for if we think that a little <hi>Rain</hi> is ſufficient to ſatisfie our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> we ſhall ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we are groſly deceiv'd, <hi>Gnats</hi> will annoy them, the head will remain ſmall, hard and dry; and finally, the <hi>Suckers</hi> will only produce <hi>Leaves;</hi> the Experience of what is ſeen among ſubſtantial ſale <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> ſufficiently juſtifies the Neceſſity and Importance of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings; they ſeldom fail watering of their <hi>Gardens</hi> whatever <hi>Rains</hi> may fall during the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> and indeed their Ware is much finer than that of others who water leſs.</p>
                        <p>During ſeven or eight Months of the Year, there is generally a neceſſity of Watering all that grows in <hi>Kitchen Gardens, Aſparagus</hi> only excepted, which only performing their Duty at the Entrance of the Spring are ſatisfied with the moiſtures of the Winter, and want none after the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May:</hi> But whereas thoſe two Months are the times of Blaſting and Drought, there is often a Neceſſity of Watering even the new Planted <hi>Trees;</hi> nay, ſometimes it is good to Water thoſe, which having brought forth a great Quantity of Green <hi>Fruit</hi> appear moderately Vigorous, and require ſome help in order to a good Reaping, which they are preparing for us; eſpecially if the <hi>Earth</hi> be naturally dry and light, thoſe Waterings muſt not be neglected at the Time of the Summer Solſtice, and they muſt be renew'd in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to form their <hi>Pulp,</hi> the Seaſon being very dry; otherwiſe they remain ſmall, ſtony and not pallatable.</p>
                        <p>From whence it naturally follows, that Water is abſolutely Neceſſary in <hi>Gardens,</hi> and that plentifully too, in order to perform the Neceſſary Waterings they require in due time; for indeed what can be made of any <hi>Ground</hi> without Water, it will remain altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for Productions, and diſagreeable to ſight; therefore the beſt way is to pitch upon Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations that have the Convenience of Water; and whoever does not make that one of <note place="margin">Anima mea, ſicut terra ſine aqua. <hi>Pſal.

                        <p>IT is very difficult, nay very rare to meet with Situations that are ſo equal in all their Extent, as not to have any Riſe or Fall on any ſide; but yet it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: I do not think it very neceſſary to look for any to be as ſmooth as Water, but yet it is a happineſs when ſuch are met with; great Inequalities are certainly troubleſom for <hi>Gardens.</hi> The Inundations or Overflowings which happen after long Rains, cauſe cruel Diſorders in them, and cut out a World of Work to repair them; moderate Inequalities do no great harm, but rather good, eſpecially in a dry <hi>Earth,</hi> when inclining to a Wall expos'd to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> that part, as we have already ſaid, being ſeldom ſoak'd by the Waters that fall from the Skies; they light moſt upon the Expoſure of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and thus a fall guiding the Waters towards that <hi>Eaſt</hi> part, is very favourable.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in my Opinion, as much as is poſſible, a ſituation that has but a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality is to be preferr'd before another that has much; and if any be tolerable, 'tis only that I have been ſpeaking of; inſomuch, that in <hi>Gardens</hi> that are too much inclinable to Drought, or lie ſomewhat high, and are of a perfect Level, it will be proper to allow them a little inequality: For Example, ſuch a one as may be Imperceptible, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual in all the Walks that lie <hi>Southerly,</hi> to the end that the Water which is of no Uſe in thoſe Walks may fall into the Feet of the <hi>Trees</hi> of thoſe two Expoſitions.</p>
                        <p>Such an Artificial Deſcent produces two good Effects, the firſt in that it is to be wiſh'd that thoſe parts may never want a little moiſture, in order to Correct their Drought, whether proceeding from the Nature of the <hi>Earth</hi> and Situation, or from the Heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> by thoſe Waters. The ſecond is to hinder thoſe Waters, by that means, from running into ſome other parts of the <hi>Garden,</hi> where they might prove prejudicial.</p>
                        <p>But when there is an indiſpenſable Neceſſity of making Uſe of a Situation that is very unequal for a <hi>Garden.</hi> I explain hereafter in the Thirteenth Chapter what I think proper to be done, in order to Correct the Defects of it, as far as Induſtry can reach.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Fifth Condition, which requires a pleaſant Figure for a <hi>Garden,</hi> together with a well plac'd Entrance.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT will not be difficult for me to prove, That the Figure of our <hi>Gardens</hi> ought to be agreeable; it is neceſſary the Eyes ſhould meet at firſt wherewith to be ſatisfy'd, without any thing Fantaſtical to offend them: The fineſt Figure that can be deſir'd for a <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> and even the moſt convenient for <hi>Culture,</hi> is without doubt that which forms a Beautiful Square, eſpecially when it is ſo perfect, and ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd in all its Extent, that not only the Corners may form ſtreight Angles; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, that the Length may be above once and a half or twice as long again as it is broad: For Inſtance, Twenty Fathom to Ten or Twelve, Fourty to Eighteen or Twenty, or Fourſcore to Forty, Fifty or Threeſcore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is moſt certain, that thoſe ſquare Figures afford the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> wherewith to form fine Squares with Eaſe, and to raiſe fine Beds; there is a great deal of Delight in ſeeing true Squares of <hi>Stawberries, Artichokes, Aſparagus, &amp;c.</hi> great Beds of <hi>Charvel, Parſly</hi> and <hi>Sorrel,</hi> all very even, ſtreight, exactly proportion'd out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be done when the Figure is Irregular, or at leaſt, not without loſing a great deal of Time, when in ſome Meaſure, to hide the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it, he endeavours to find or make ſomething approaching to a Square.</p>
                        <p>Whence it is eaſie to conclude, how much I diſlike in the Caſe of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> all other Indented Figures, Diagonals, Rounds, Ovals, Triangles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are only proper for <hi>Thickets</hi> and <hi>Parterres,</hi> or <hi>Flower Gardens,</hi> in which Places they are at once both very uſeful, and of a great Beauty.</p>
                        <p>I do not queſtion but all People will be Curious to afford their <hi>Gardens</hi> the Beautiful Figure now in Queſtion, when at Liberty to pick and chuſe. It is a great Vexation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48210:43"/>
when an ill Neighbourhood reduces us to the Neceſſity of ſuff'ring imperfect Figures, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and unequal ſides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Happy are thoſe who meet with kind obliging Neighbours; Wo to them who meet with ſuch as are croſs and ill natur'd.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Although the Figure of an Oblong Right Angled Square, be the moſt proper, yet I have made a fine <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> of one hundred and ten <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms in length, and ſixty broad, ſomewhat reſembling the Figure A of a <hi>Lozenge;</hi> and whereas I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the chief Entrance in the middle of the narroweſt ſide, it is not eaſie to diſtinguiſh the ſmall Irregularity a <hi>Geometritian</hi> would ſind in it, and it is a very neceſſary Precaution to conceal as much as is poſſible, certain inconſiderable defects, which are met with in the ſpace of a <hi>Garden,</hi> and to diſpoſe the Ally's, and the diviſion of the Squares or Plats, as if the <hi>Ground</hi> was exactly of a Square Figure; for though neither the Angles or the four ſides are perfectly equal, it does not hinder the Plats from appearing perfect in their Proportion.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, for the better Ornament of our <hi>Kitchen Garden,</hi> eſpecially if it be large, it is proper that the Entrance ſhould be plac'd juſt in the middle of that part which has moſt Extent, as it appears by the Figure at the Point A in order to face an Alley, which conſiſting of the whole length of the <hi>Garden,</hi> may appear ſtately, and divide the <hi>Ground</hi> into two equal parts; each of thoſe parts, compoſing Squares or Plats too long in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their breadth, muſt afterwards be ſubdivided into other ſmall parts, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; the Entrance would not look ſo well in the middle of one of the broadeſt ſides, as it appears by the Figure B. a long Proſpect, moderately broad on both ſides is much more pleaſing; than to have a long one on the ſides, and a ſhort one before; however, it is ſometimes impoſſible to diſpoſe the Entrance otherwiſe, and in ſuch a Caſe we muſt have Patience, and the ſame when we are neceſſitated to make it in one of the Corners, or thereabouts, though it be not ſo well; yet I have made very fine <hi>Gardens,</hi> which have their Entrance in one of the Corners, which I would not have done, had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Ground</hi> permitted me to place it better; and yet no body finds fault with it, by reaſon that it faces a fine Alley, which is border'd all along by one of the great <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> or Walls full of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is very agreeable to the ſight, when it is kept in good Order, ſuch is the Entrance of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>Rambouillet.</hi>

                           <p>Of the ſixth Condition which requires a <hi>Garden</hi> to be well enclos'd with Walls and Doors that ſhut well.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS Incloſure, I deſire, ſufficiently teſtifies, that for <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen Gardens</hi> I am not very deſirous of thoſe open Proſpects which are ſo neceſſary for other <hi>Gardens;</hi> not but when the Situation will permit, I am very glad to enjoy the benefit of it.

                        <p>A Wall well garniſh'd, <hi>Dwarfs</hi> well order'd, and very vigorous; all manner of fine good <hi>Fruits</hi> of every Seaſon, fine <hi>Beds,</hi> and fine <hi>Plats,</hi> well furniſh'd with all manner of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>Legumes,</hi> clean Walks, of a proportionable largeneſs, fine Bordures, fill'd with uſeful things for the Houſe: In fine, a well contriv'd diverſity of all that is neceſſary in a <hi>Kitchen Garden;</hi> ſo that nothing may be wanting, either early or late, or for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the middle Seaſons; theſe indeed are the things we ought to covet in our <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> and not a Steeple, or Wood in Perſpective, a great Road, or the Neighbourhood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>So that preferably to all manner of Proſpects, I would have my <hi>Garden</hi> inclos'd with Walls, though I were to loſe ſome fine point of Proſpect by it, beſides that the ſhelter they may afford againſt troubleſome Winds, and Spring Froſts, are very conſiderable: It is almoſt impoſſible to be truly delighted with a <hi>Garden,</hi> as for inſtance, to have early <hi>Legumes</hi> and fine <hi>Fruits</hi> without the help of thoſe Walls; beſides, there are ſtill many things, which dreading great heats, would hardly be able to grow in the hotteſt part of the Summer, unleſs a Wall expos'd to the <hi>North</hi> favour'd them with ſome ſhadow.</p>
                        <p>In effect, Walls are ſo neceſſary for <hi>Gardens,</hi> that even to multiply them, I make as many little <hi>Gardens</hi> as I can in the Neighbourhood of the great one, whereby I have not only more <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> or <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> and ſhelter, which is very conſiderable; but am alſo thereby enabled to correct ſome defects and Irregularities, which would render the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> deſagreeable; for in fine, I will at any rate have a principal <hi>Garden,</hi> that may pleaſe in its Figure and ſize, deſign'd for large <hi>Legumes,</hi> and ſome high <hi>Standards;</hi> a large <hi>Garden</hi> would without doubt be leſs pleaſing, if for Inſtance, it were too long for its breadth, or too wide for its length, if it had a corner, or ſome viſible wrineſs to disfigure it, which being retrench'd, would make all the reſt ſquare; and thus ſuch <hi>Gardens</hi> being leſſen'd either on one, or on both ends, will afford ground to make little agreeable uſeful <hi>Gardens,</hi> as I have done in many great Houſes, in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides the Incloſure of the Walls, I am likewiſe for having good Locks to my Doors, that my <hi>Gard'ner</hi> may be able to anſwer for all that is in the <hi>Garden;</hi> I am ſenſible that there are ſome, who are very diſcreet and careful, but then I likewiſe know that there are others who deſire nothing more than to have ſome Pretences.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Am not ignorant that the Countrey affords large and moderate Houſes, of which the firſt may be accompany'd with ſeveral <hi>Gardens,</hi> and the other ſatisfy'd with one only.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48210:44"/>
As to thoſe which may have ſeveral <hi>Gardens,</hi> it is proper that thoſe that are deſign'd for <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> I mean the <hi>Parterres,</hi> ſhould face the principal Aſpect of the Houſe, ſince nothing can be more agreeable than to ſee at all times on that ſide the charming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of a Succeſſion of <hi>Flowers</hi> whatever they be; they are ſo many different Scenes, or Decorations upon a Stage, of which the Figure never alters, they afford perpetual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to delight the Eye, and charm us with their Sweets; but whereas generally thoſe <hi>Parterres</hi> are as publick, and as open to every body as the very Court of the Houſe, it is not fit to put any thing into them, the loſs whereof might diſcompoſe us.</p>
                        <p>For theſe Reaſons I allow that in ſuch Houſes, the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> ſhould not be Situated in the beſt Place, beſides the laſt being ſubject to have many things, which though neceſſary, are not always pleaſing to the Eye or Smell; as alſo producing many things, deſign'd for the Pleaſure and Satisfaction of the Maſter, which might tempt ſome licouriſh indiſcreet Perſons, and ſo occaſion cauſe of Diſpleaſure and Complaint, I think it very neceſſary to place thoſe <hi>Gardens</hi> out of the reach of the Publick.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as much as can be, we content our ſelves with placing them in the beſt <hi>Ground</hi> we can meet with, without prejudicing the place of the <hi>Parterre,</hi> pretty near to <note place="margin">Optima ſterco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio veſtigia domini. <hi>Ex Pln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi>
                           </note> the Houſe, being of a convenient eaſie Acceſs; the Ancients were of this Sentiment, when they ſaid, that the Steps of the Maſter, that is, his frequent Viſits, were of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful uſe for the Neatneſs, Abundance, Goodneſs and Beauty of <hi>Gardens;</hi> ſo that <hi>Gardens</hi> that are at a diſtance, or of difficult Acceſs, are liable to Diſorders, Filth and Sterility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope that whereas in the beginning of this Work, I have preſum'd to ſay, that none ought to pretend to have one of our <hi>Gardens,</hi> unleſs he were paſſably well skill'd in the <hi>Culture</hi> of it; none will undertake to make one, unleſs he may be able to afford himſelf the Pleaſure of ſeeing it well <hi>Cultivated,</hi> and conſequently he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee it often, which cannot be done, the <hi>Garden</hi> being at a diſtance, or of a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Acceſs.</p>
                        <p>As to the Houſes, that can no wiſe afford above one <hi>Garden,</hi> I ſuppoſe it will hardly enter into any ones Thoughts to employ it wholly in <hi>Box</hi> or <hi>Bowling-Greens,</hi> inſtead of Imploying it in <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Legumes:</hi> In ſuch a Caſe, whether in the Town or Country, the ſpace of the <hi>Garden</hi> being reaſonably large, it will be proper to take part of that which is neareſt to make a ſmall <hi>Parterre,</hi> leaving the reſt for things that are of uſe and neceſſary; but if the Place be not large, my Advice is to make no <hi>Parterre;</hi> at leaſt I would make none, being perſuaded, that <hi>Flowers</hi> may be eaſily diſpens'd with; reſolving then to employ ones <hi>Ground</hi> in <hi>Plants</hi> that are for uſe; that part of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> which is moſt pleaſing, ought to be put moſt within ſight of the Houſe, keeping ſuch as might offend the Sight or Smell, moſt at diſtance: <hi>Fine Eſpaliers, Dwarfs, Greens, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, Sallads</hi> and the perpetual Action of the <hi>Gard'ners, &amp;c.</hi> being ſufficient to employ the Neighbourhood of ſome Windows, even for pretty conſiderable Houſes, as well as for ordinary ones.</p>
                        <p>I am ſo ſenſible of the innocent Pleaſure, the ſight of a fine <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> can afford, that I am for making ſome fine Arbor in all large <hi>Gardens,</hi> not only to ſerve for ſhelter in caſe of a ſudden Storm, which happens pretty often, but alſo for the Satisfaction of conveniently ſeeing the <hi>Culture</hi> of a <hi>Ground</hi> that is well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, I do not condemn thoſe, who having but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall <hi>Garden,</hi> affect <hi>Flowers,</hi> their Inclination leading them to it preferably to any other <hi>Plants.</hi>

                        <p>I ſay, if this <hi>Earth</hi> happen to have any of theſe Defects, I know no better Expedient than to have it altogether taken away, in order to ſucceed, and that within the Depth of three Foot in ſuch Places as are to be the chief Ornaments of the <hi>Gardens; viz.</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> and long Rooted <hi>Plants,</hi> and two large Foot where the leſſer <hi>Plants</hi> are to be, filling it up again with the ſame quantity of the beſt <hi>Mould</hi> that can conveniently be brought to it; which being done, one may reſt ſatisfy'd for a long while, all will go well, without the trouble of any other Amendments; but in caſe ſo much good <hi>Mould</hi> as would be neceſſary to put every where, could not conveniently be had; at leaſt it will be neceſſary to endeavour to get as much as may ſerve for the <hi>Trees,</hi> making a ſhift with indifferent good <hi>Mould</hi> for the reſt of the <hi>Garden,</hi> that is, for <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> it will not be difficult to amend it, as ſhall be declar'd hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I am ſenſible, that the Charge of great Tranſportations, frightens, eſpecially in the caſe of large <hi>Gardens,</hi> but then 'tis but ſeldom that People engage themſelves to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it; thoſe are works for Kings, the <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> of <hi>Verſailles</hi> is a terrible Inſtance of it: But as for ſmall City <hi>Gardens,</hi> the occaſions of doing it are often met with, and whereas the Expence of it is not too great, the Undertaking of it is very tollerable. This then is all that is to be done, when the Surface of the <hi>Garden</hi> is no higher than it ought to be, and has no other Defect than the ill Quality of the <hi>Ground.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to Explain my ſelf as to this height, I ſuppoſe that the Matter in Hand only relates to the <hi>Garden</hi> that is immediately next the Houſe, for which it is, and no wiſe for others, which Lying at a greater diſtance do not want ſo much precaution; now, in my Opinion, this firſt <hi>Garden</hi> ought to lie ſomewhat lower than the Houſe, and thus the Houſe being upon a higher <hi>Ground,</hi> it ought to have a Balluſtre with ſome Steps to come down into that <hi>Garden,</hi> which is an Ornament to be wiſh'd for in ſuch Occaſions, and without doubt ſuch an aſſent of Two or Three Foot above the <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Garden,</hi> renders it much more pleaſant to Sight, than it would be, if it lay level with the ſtep of the Door, and conſequently much finer than thoſe that lay higher than the level or floor; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an aſſent, and are thereby liable to great Inconveniences.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48210:45"/>
I return to the other Caſes heretofore propos'd to ſay, That in caſe ſuch a Place full of ill <hi>Earth,</hi> were too low, of about Five or Six Foot in Surface, it is viſible that half the Expence would be ſav'd, ſince there would only be a neceſſity of raiſing it higher, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any of it away; but however we muſt ſtill reckon firſt on the ſmall deſcent the <hi>Garden</hi> ought to be ſituated upon, in relation to the Houſe; and, ſecondly upon the Three Foot of <hi>Earth</hi> that muſt be brought thither, particularly for the <hi>Trees</hi> and large <hi>Plants,</hi> and in order not to be miſtaken, it will be proper to meaſure that <hi>Earth</hi> upon the place where it is to be taken with a rul'd Gage, by reaſon that this height of Three Foot, as it lies, being newly ſtir'd, will at firſt appear to make a greater Dimenſion, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being ſettled will reduce it ſelf to the height propos'd, which I hold to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neccſſary, and unleſs care has been taken to meaſure the <hi>Earth</hi> before the moving of it, People muſt not flatter themſelves that there will be enough, unleſs there be Four Foot or thereabouts in the firſt Months, which the Rains and Time will ſoon reduce to Three; otherwiſe, having had but Three Foot at firſt, they will ſoon find it dwindled to Two at moſt; that is too little by a Foot: And thus People will be expos'd to the Vexationof ſeeing all their <hi>Trees</hi> periſh at the end of a few Years, and to be reduc'd to begin a new, if they continu'd in the mind of mkaing their <hi>Trees</hi> ſucceed.</p>
                        <p>In the Neighbourhood of great Cities, great Conveniences may ſometimes be met with to raiſe and fill up places in <hi>Gardens</hi> without much coſt, 'tis only allowing the Liberty of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rubbiſh of the Foundations of Houſes there; but often ſuch Conveniences coſt a great deal of Time, which in the Caſe of Planting is much to be fear'd, and even coſts a great deal of Money to have it ſifted, otherwiſe the <hi>Garden</hi> will be in danger of having more Stones and ill Sand than real <hi>Earth,</hi> and conſequently the Owner of having an ill <hi>Garden;</hi> upon which every one may conſult his Purſe and Pleaſure, and regulate himſelf accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The Anſwer I have made to the firſt Article, relating to a very ill <hi>Earth,</hi> where a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> is deſign'd, may likewiſe ſerve for the Fourth, in which we ſuppoſe a place for a <hi>Garden</hi> without any <hi>Earth</hi> at all; Three Foot of good <hi>Earth</hi> muſt be brought to it, getting it as near hand as can be to ſave Money.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> Caſe, in which the <hi>Ground</hi> having a ſufficient depth, the <hi>Earth</hi> is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding but Indifferent; that is, either a little too dry and light, or a little too tough and moiſt, which are the two common Defects; or elſe, that there may be cauſe to judge it too much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the <hi>Earth</hi> is really good; but yet there is not enough of it to accompliſh Three Foot depth, two Conſiderations are to be had; the firſt to examine whether the Surface be of a proper height or not: When it is of a proper height, all that is nought in the Ground muſt of neceſſity be removed, whether Sand, Gravel or Stones, putting as much good <hi>Mould</hi> in the Room of it, as will be neceſſary to have the depth requir'd, ſtill preſerving our Height.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the ſame Operation muſt be perform'd, in removing all that is bad under good <hi>Earth,</hi> when the Surface being, too high compar'd to the level of the Houſe, there is a neceſſity of ſinking it, in order to be one ſtep higher than the level of the <hi>Garden;</hi> upon which all People may eaſily regulate themſelves, to do it more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigencies of their <hi>Ground</hi> and its wants; but ſtill, keeping to the quantity of good <hi>Earth</hi> propos'd, as well as to the diſtance that muſt be from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Garden</hi> to the Door which ſerves for an Entrance into it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> being according to our Wiſhes, both as to quantity and goodneſs, and yet too low in the Surface; we muſt likewiſe examin how much too low it lyes, in order to raiſe it conformably to our Wants and Wiſhes; it might chance to lay ſo low, that there would be a neceſſity to raiſe it conſiderably above three Foot, in which caſe all the good <hi>Earth</hi> muſt be dug up, and laid aſide, and the bottom rais'd ſufficiently with what ever could be got good or bad; after which the good <hi>Earth</hi> muſt be laid over it again with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and mixture heretofore explain'd. I could wiſh I had better Expedients to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to avoid the Charges of Tranſportation; but truly I know none.</p>

There now remains to Examine what is to be done in the fifth Caſe, to correct the over great Moiſtures ſome <hi>Gardens</hi> are ſubject to, which rot every thing, and make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction not only backward, but alſo inſipid and bad; none but hot and dry <hi>Earths</hi> are forward; thoſe that are moiſt are always cold, and conſequently have no diſpoſition for <note place="margin">At ſceleratum exquirere frigus difficile eſt. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2. Labor omnia vincit improbus, &amp;c. <hi>Virg. Georg.</hi> 1.</note> Novelties. This cold which is inſeparable from Moiſture, is of all defects the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be cur'd: The Ancients knew it as well as we do, and have given it the Name of Deceiver. But ſtill ſince <hi>Earth</hi> has been ſubmitted to the Induſtry of Man, and that there are but few things labour cannot overcome; let us declare what a long Experience has taught us in this Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Moiſtures are either natural and perpetual in <hi>Earth,</hi> or only accidental and paſſing; in the firſt caſe we have two Expedients:</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, to turn aſide at a diſtance, if poſſible, by Conduits or Gutters, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that annoy us, and give them a diſcharge to remove them from us, which being done, the <hi>Ground</hi> will not fail becoming dry; and when the firſt is impracticable,</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, To raiſe the whole <hi>Plats,</hi> or only the great <hi>Beds</hi> upon Ridges, and to that end make deep Furrows to ſerve for kind of <hi>Paths:</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> that is taken from thence will ſerve to raiſe the <hi>Plats</hi> or <hi>Beds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if thoſe Moiſtures are only Tranſitory, and, for Inſtance, only occaſion'd by great <hi>Rains,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Ground</hi> not proper to ſoak them in, recourſe muſt be had to the ſame Expedient of raiſing of the <hi>Earth</hi> to drain them, and to the making of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits or Gutters to carry thoſe Waters out of the <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Finally,</hi> The Moiſture not being extraordinary, the contrary of what we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for very dry <hi>Grounds</hi> muſt be done, that is, the <hi>Earth</hi> muſt be rais'd a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Walks, to the end that thoſe Walks may ſerve as a drain to thoſe elevated <hi>Beds,</hi> juſt as in the other Caſe the haughing of the Borders ſerves as a drain to receive and improve by the Waters of the adjacent Walks.</p>
                        <p>In order to raiſe <hi>Grounds,</hi> nothing can be better than what we have ſaid to raiſe the Surface; and in caſe Conveniences be wanting for the Tranſportation of <hi>Earth,</hi> having abundance of great Dung at hand, it may be us'd inſtead of it, as I have ſaid about the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> mixing it abundantly at the bottom of the <hi>Ground,</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the <hi>Earth,</hi> in order to raiſe it as much as is neceſſary; but ſtill great Conduits are of great uſe.</p>
                        <p>I conclude what relates to the Preparation of ſuch <hi>Grounds</hi> as are defective, either in their quality, or too ſmall quantity, carefully exhorting thoſe who dig the Ground along ſome Walls, to take care firſt not to approach too near the Foundations, and to leave always ſome ſolid Banck undug, leſt the Wall might tumble down by its own weight, or by ſome unexpected ſhowers. I exhort in the ſecond place to fill up ſuch Trenches immediately after their being empty'd, or rather at the very ſame time, one part after another; for want of which, and for the ſame Reaſons, the danger of tumbling is yet greater.</p>
                        <p>After having examin'd what relates to the Conditions that are neceſſary for the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> that are to be made, <hi>viz.</hi> The quality and quantity of good <hi>Earth,</hi> the happy Situation, and favourable Expoſure, the convenience of Waterings, the level of the Ground, the Figure, Entrance and Cloſure of the <hi>Garden,</hi> together with the Proximity of the Place; having alſo propos'd the means to correct the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Drought and Moiſture, there ſtill remains to ſpeak upon the Subject of the Acclivities and Declivities, when they are too ſleep for the <hi>Gardens</hi> we are abſolutely compell'd to chooſe.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE have already ſaid what is to be wiſh'd for certain Inequalities, that may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable in <hi>Gardens,</hi> and Inſinuated what is to be fear'd from the Inconveniences of the great ones; let us now ſpeak of what may be proper to remedy ſuch as may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; In order to which, as ſoon as the Place of the <hi>Garden</hi> is reſolv'd on, upon the Conſiderations heretofore eſtabliſh'd, the Figure being either very ſquare, ſo that the Sides and Angles may be altogether, or at leaſt partly Equal and Parallel, which is moſt to be wiſh'd for; or elſe Irregular, the Angles or Sides being unequal, or having perhaps more or leſs than four Sides or Angles, both the one and the other differing in themſelves, either in length or overture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Defects fit to be avoided, if poſſible, or at leaſt endeavours muſt be us'd to rectifie them.</p>
                        <p>The Place of the <hi>Garden</hi> being, I ſay, reſolv'd upon, either Voluntarily or out of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, the Encloſure muſt not be begun, until after having taken the Level of all the <hi>Ground,</hi> to know all the Acclivities and Declivities, in order to take Meaſures accordingly; otherwiſe one might fall into many great Inconveniences, either as to the Walls that are to be made, or in reſpect to the Allies and Squares.</p>
                        <p>It is moſt certain; that every piece of <hi>Ground</hi> may chance to have different Riſings and Falls, <hi>viz.</hi> One, Two or Three for as many ſides; and One for every Diagonal: And 'tis almoſt impoſſible to know the true Level of a <hi>Garden,</hi> without having firſt taken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards regulated all the Inequalities.</p>
                        <p>The Diagonals, to ſpeak more Intelligibly in Favour of ſome <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> are, as it were, the two Arms of a St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Croſs, which may and ought to be figur'd by Trenches carried from Corner to Corner a croſs ſome Place.</p>
                        <p>There is no neceſſity of ſaying, that the Level of thoſe Inequalities are always taken from the higheſt part of the piece that is to be Level'd, to go to the loweſt which is oppoſite to it, no Body being ignorant of it. Thus the Level of the Diagonals is taken, beginning from Corner, or Angle, to go to a lower oppoſite Corner: For Inſtance, the Diagonal A. B. begins at a Corner or Angles, which is form'd by the meeting of two ſides, whereof the one is expos'd to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the other to the <hi>South,</hi> to go to a lower oppoſite ſide, which is form'd by the meeting of the ſide expos'd to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and the ſide expos'd to the <hi>North;</hi> the other Diagonal ſhall be drawn from the one to the other of the two Corners, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, C. D. which remain in the Figure we are examining, and is mark'd here. The
<figure/>
Level of the Expoſure is taken all along every ſide, beginning, as we have ſaid, from the higheſt part to come to the loweſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48210:46"/>
In order to take every Level very true, it muſt be done upon a very ſtreight Line, which ſhall be drawn either along the ſide that is to be level'd, which is the beſt; or upon another Line very Parallel to that ſide.</p>
                        <p>Every Level to be pretty true, though not ſo true as that of the Water of Fountains, in which even half a Line is very material; but, in fine, to be ſufficient for the uſe now in queſtion, every Level, I ſay, muſt be taken with the Rule and Leveller, which every body knows is a Triangular Inſtrument with a Lead, or other little Bowl hung to a ſmall
<figure/>
Cord, and that fix'd to the obtuſe Angle; this Leveller being fix'd upon the Rule, this ſmall Cord muſt meet the notch that is made on purpoſe, both on the Top of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and upon the middle point of the ſide that ſerves for a Baſis to that Inſtrument, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that that Level is never true until that Cord with its Lead naturally falls into thoſe Notches.</p>
                        <p>This is the manner of performing this Operation, which I might, perhaps, ſave my ſelf the trouble of Explaining, it being already Explain'd in ſo many Books of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Mechanicks; but our <hi>Gard'ner</hi> perhaps having none of them, will be ſatisfy'd with what I ſhall tell him.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the Leveller and the Rule, which muſt be very ſtreight, and about Two or Three Fathom long, there muſt be three wooden Spikes to be driven into the <hi>Ground</hi> with a Mallet; and thoſe three Spikes muſt be of a very even equal length, about Three or Four Foot, all ſplit on the Top, in order to put white Paper in that ſlit.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould not need to ſay (it being evident of it ſelf) That there muſt be at leaſt Three or Four Perſons, that is, Three while the Rule and Leveller are us'd, and Four when it comes to the Spikes; one of theſe Perſons muſt in all Caſes ſtand on the loweſt part of the ſide that is to be Levell'd, holding a Perch to ſerve for a Mark, in order to raiſe or louer the ſaid Perch, according to the Direction of him who is to regulate the Line and Leveller.</p>
                        <p>To find the Level: Having choſen a calm Day without Wind and Rain, and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, a little lou'ring; or, at leaſt, being ſo plac'd, that the great brightneſs of the <hi>Sun</hi> may not prejudice the Sight, one of theſe Spikes muſt be driven into the <hi>Ground</hi> even to the Surface, which muſt remain, and another in a ſtreight Line a little below it; in order to place the Rule immediately and conveniently upon it, which being done, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller muſt be put upon the Rule, raiſing or ſinking the ſecond Spike, until the Lead falls directly, and of it ſelf, without any Motion of the Wind, or any thing elſe into the Notches.</p>
                        <p>This being perform'd, the ſecond Spike muſt be abſolutely fix'd, and the Leveller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, after which, lying flat upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> one may aim or level with the Eye upon the Rule ſo fix'd and order'd towards the Perſon who holds the Perch below with a white or black Cloth on the Top of it, who perhaps may have had occaſion to climb upon a Ladder, Wall or Tree, to raiſe or louer the ſaid Perch according to the direction of the Leveller, and that until the Extremity of it, having been obſerv'd by the ſaid Leveller, a Calculation may be made exactly how many Foot or Fathoms there are in a direct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Line from that Extremity, which is the Top of the Perch or Spike, unto the natural Surface of the <hi>Ground,</hi> which lies immediately beneath the ſaid Perch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas the poſture of lying down is too Inconvenient; the <hi>Ground</hi> may and ought to be dug near the firſt Spike that is driven into the <hi>Ground,</hi> low enough for any one to level with the Eye, ſtanding, ſitting or kneeling in it; or elſe uſe may be made of two of the Spikes heretofore mention'd, to which end they muſt be plac'd aſunder upon two others that are fix'd into the <hi>Ground,</hi> or upon ſome other piece of Wood, or riſing <hi>Ground</hi> made on purpoſe, where they muſt be kept very upright, after which the Rule muſt be plac'd upon the ſaid ſticks, examining with the Leveller, whether the Rule lies
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48210:47"/>
upon a true level, in order to level or aim with the Eye, and when there is occaſion for a third perſon, and conſequently for a third ſtick, they muſt be plac'd with the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs as the two firſt; the third being plac'd at any diſtance whatever, having a piece of Linen, or Paper, or a Hat upon the top of that ſpike, ſerves to aim more conveniently; ſo that having met at the End of the proſpect, the extremity of the perch or ſtick that is held below, the borrow'd height of the ſticks, as well as the height of the Rule, muſt be deduc'd upon the whole, and thus the Level will prove true. For Inſtance, in aiming, Twelve Foot may be found from the top of the Perch to the Surface of the <hi>Earth,</hi> out of which may be deduc'd firſt the four borrow'd Foot of the ſticks, upon the Top of which the Leveller had laid his Rule, for which muſt alſo be deduc'd Three or Four Inches, which altogether amounts to Four Foot, and Four Inches; by which Supputation will be found ſeven Foot and Eight Inches declivity from that part of the Surface which is regulated, and to remain, from whence the Leveller aim'd, to the Surface of that part, where the laſt ſpike ſtuck, the level of which is look'd for.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Inequalities are either Conſiderable, or not.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are Inconſiderable are tolerable; for Inſtance, only half an Inch or an Inch and a half in a Fathom, which hardly wants, being corrected, if the Expence will amount to any thing conſiderable; ſo that a declivity of about a Foot or Two, or Two and a half to a length of Twenty Fathom, will do no great harm, and would hardly be percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, being only of half an Inch, or an Inch and half in a Fathom: Which ought to comfort one, eſpecially if there be a great length, ſince a declivity of Twelve or Fifteen Foot upon Fourſcore Fathom in length, though pernicious, is not ſo ſenſible nor inconvenient as one of Two Foot and a half upon Twenty Fathom, although the proportion be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together equal.</p>
                        <p>If a deſcent of two, or two Inches and a half <hi>per</hi> Fathom is conſiderable, what would it be if there were three, four, five, or more, then it muſt of neceſſity be corrected, which may be done four ways.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> in ſinking that part of the Ground which lyes too high, as much as will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to take away the roughneſs of the Aſcent; and, in the ſecond place, in carrying to the lower part what ſhall be taken from the higher, whereby a deſcent of five Foot will be reduc'd to three, taking a foot from the upper part, and placing it upon the lower; ſo that the upper will be a Foot lower than it was, and the lower a Foot higher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But whereas, above all things, care muſt be taken to preſerve always three large Foot in depth of good <hi>Earth,</hi> before any thing be taken away from the upper part, holes muſt be made in different places of it, to examin how much good <hi>Earth</hi> we have there, in order to decide, whether we may really take any of it away, and how much; or whether we cannot take any part of it without prejudice to the Ground of the <hi>Garden;</hi> upon which it is eaſie to reſolve; for the depth of good <hi>Earth</hi> being ſufficient to bear a diminution, part of it muſt be taken away to moderate the declivity in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>But if, on the contrary, none of it can be taken away without prejudice to the depth or quantity that is neceſſary there, recourſe muſt be had to a third Expedient, which is, either not to meddle with the height at all, and to raiſe the lower part as well as we can for the beſt, in putting more good <hi>Earth</hi> over that which is good already, if it can be done conveniently, or elſe to take up that which is good, to put worſe at the bottom, nay even Stones or Gravel, if nothing better can be had; afterwards covering it all again with the good <hi>Earth</hi> that was taken up before; or if the Ground of the upper part may be ſunk, all the good <hi>Earth</hi> muſt be taken up and laid aſide, until ſo much of the bad, which lay under it, as ſhall be thought proper, ſhall have been remov'd; which being done, that which is good ſhall be laid again in the room of the bad.</p>
                        <p>But in caſe none of theſe three Expedients be practicable, we muſt make uſe of the fourth, which is pretty chargeable, but yet abſolutely neceſſary; and he who meets with ſo untoward a Situation, muſt comfort himſelf as well as he can, if he deſigns to have a profitable pleaſant <hi>Garden,</hi> ſince it is impoſſible to compaſs it by any other means.</p>
                        <p>This fourth Expedient is to divide this great deſcent into different degrees, or different Portions, to make ſeveral particular Terraſſes of it, ſome higher, and ſome lower, and all of them more or leſs broad, according as the declivity is more or leſs conſiderable; after which every one of thoſe Terraſſes ſhall be diſpos'd in themſelves, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod aforementioned, in order to correct moderate Inequalities; but that is not all, for every one of thoſe Terraſſes muſt be ſupported and ſtay'd to hinder them from tumbling down, which muſt be done by little Walls, or ſmall Banks well beaten and trampled, with ſome ſteps proper to deſcend from the one to the other, or elſe by ſome Banks that ſhall be ſodded on purpoſe, to make them the more ſolid and laſting; and finally, as if they were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48210:47"/>
ſo many ſeparate <hi>Gardens,</hi> they muſt be accompany'd with Walks of a breadth proportion'd to their length, as we ſhall declare in the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>To end this matter, I am only to add, that the little Walls may ſerve for very good <hi>Wall-Fruit,</hi> the Expoſure being good, or elſe for <hi>Rasberry-buſhes, Goosberry Shrubs,</hi> or <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> the Expoſure ſtanding <hi>Northward;</hi> the ſmall Banks will not be uſeleſs neither, on the contrary, lying to the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they may be uſeful for Spring <hi>Plants,</hi> as Winter <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, Peaſe, Beans, Strawberries, Artichokes,</hi> &amp;c. and after the Spring they may be us'd for <hi>Purcelane, Baſil,</hi> &amp;c. and if there be abundance of thoſe Banks well expos'd, a conſiderable part of them may always be employ'd in good <hi>Grapes,</hi> and other <hi>Fruits,</hi> as I have done in the King's <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> on certain Banks made on purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>When our Banks look to the <hi>North,</hi> they will be good all the Summer for <hi>Charvel,</hi> or elſe to ſow things that muſt be Tranſplanted, as <hi>Lettuce, Succory, Cabbaget, Celery, &amp;c.</hi> ſince there is no part of a <hi>Garden</hi> but may be uſeful for ſome things or other.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Banks require a neceſſary Precaution, which is not only to beat and trample them extream cloſe at the bottom at the time they are made; but eſpecially to keep the upper part of every Bank a little higher than the Neighbouring Alley to it, otherwiſe the Water running down from the Banks of the whole Terras, would ſoon ruin and demoliſh them; and, if notwithſtanding this Precaution, any accident ſhould befal it, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be repair'd in the Winter, by adding ſome <hi>Earth</hi> to it, which muſt be well tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and beaten anew, leaving only three or four Inches of good <hi>Earth</hi> looſe on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, which muſt be afterwards cultivated, in order to make that Place fit for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                        <p>And whereas I do not expect that the great Inequalities of <hi>Gardens</hi> ſhould be abſolutely levell'd, I would have little Fences made from ſpace to ſpace in the Alleys or Walks, to turn the Water of great Showers into the adjacent Squares or Plats; which Fences muſt be made with boards ſtuck into the Ground a-croſs the Walks, about two or three Inches above the Surface of the Walks; and in caſe thoſe Fences or Stays ſhould not prove ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I would have a drein made at the lower end of every <hi>Garden</hi> for the disburthening of thoſe Waters; or at leaſt, the Neighbourhood not allowing this diſcharge, I would have a great hole made (that is a kind of Well) in ones own Ground, fill'd with dry Bricks; for thoſe Waters to loſe themſelves in, otherwiſe few Walls would be able to reſiſt long againſt great Inundations without demoliſhing, and conſequently, without cauſing great diſorders.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Diſpoſition or Diſtribution of the whole Ground of every <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TWO particular Conſiderations are to be had in relation to every <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Garden:</hi> The firſt is to order that <hi>Garden</hi> ſo, that it may be uſeful and abounding in its Production proportionably to its Extent, and the goodneſs of the Ground.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Conſideration is to order it ſo, that it may be agreeable to the Eye, and convenient either for Walks, or Culture, and for Gathering, thoſe being the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ends propos'd in the making of it, to which end it is not only ſufficient to know what the <hi>Earth</hi> is capable of doing of it ſelf without much help, but alſo what it is capable of performing without ſuch and ſuch helps it may receive.</p>
                        <p>To attain the firſt Point, which is the advantage of its Productions, the beſt parts of the <hi>Garden</hi> muſt be employ'd with all the Occonomy and Prudence that can be, with <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Seeds,</hi> inſomuch that no part thereof may remain uſeleſs, putting into each ſuch things as are moſt proper to ſucceed in them; and to attain the ſecond, which is Beauty and Convenience, the Ground muſt not only be agreeably diſtributed into Squares or Plats, but the Walks muſt of neceſſity be made very neat, well plac'd, and of a ſuitable ſize, to the extent of the Ground, or Place, it being moſt certain, that no Intelligent Man will make a <hi>Garden</hi> without convenient Walks, which muſt be ſuited both as to ſize and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the largeneſs or ſcantineſs thereof.</p>
                        <p>What we call the beſt parts of a <hi>Garden</hi> are really thoſe which have the beſt Ground, in caſe, as it commonly happens, it be not equally good all over, as it were to be wiſh'd; but the goodneſs of the <hi>Earth</hi> being equal, the beſt parts or places of a <hi>Garden</hi> are thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that are moſt ſhelter'd from the Wind, and conſequently receive moſt benefit by the Reflexion caus'd by the Walls.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48210:48"/>
By neceſſary well-plac'd Walks or Allys, we mean ſuch as are commonly neceſſary either near the Walls, in order to ſee the <hi>Trees,</hi> the better, to cultivate them with more eaſe, and have the convenience of gathering the <hi>Fruit;</hi> or in the whole body of the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> to divide the Ground in equal Squares, and to multiply the pleaſure of Variety in Walking, to ſee and viſit what thoſe Plats or Squares contain, as alſo that the Culture of them may be perform'd with more eaſe and convenience by the <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, as I have already ſaid, in our diſtribution we ought to look at once for the advantage of Production, and the Convenience of <hi>Culture</hi> of Walking.</p>
                        <p>As for the advantage of Production we will certainly find it, if, in the firſt place, we plant good <hi>Trees</hi> againſt all the Walls, even ſometimes, without excepting the Face of the Houſe, eſpecially, in a ſmall <hi>Garden,</hi> planting <hi>Dwarfs</hi> alſo round about the Squares, inſtead of the Counter <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> or <hi>Polehedges</hi> that were formerly in uſe, but are now aboliſh'd, by reaſon that the keeping of them in good order was very troubleſom, and their Productions very Inconſiderable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will find thoſe Advantages, if our Squares are garniſh'd with uſeful Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, at a convenient diſtance from thoſe <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and finally, if the Body of every Square be continually fill'd with good <hi>Legumes,</hi> inſomuch, that thoſe of one Seaſon be no ſooner gather'd or pick'd, than the <hi>Earth</hi> be again prepar'd to receive others for, or of, another Seaſon.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Part of this Treatiſe will ſhew what <hi>Trees</hi> will be proper to plant in all kind of <hi>Gardens,</hi> either for <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-Standards;</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> will ſhew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Cultivating</hi> and <hi>Pruning</hi> of them; and the <hi>Sixth,</hi> which contains the Treatiſe of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> will ſhew which are the Bordures I call uſeful, and which the <hi>Legumes</hi> of every Seaſon, together with the <hi>Culture</hi> that is proper for them, in order to be fine, good and ſeaſonable.</p>
                        <p>It is not ſufficient to have ſet down in general, what relates to the Advantages of the Production, we muſt likewiſe declare what relates to the Conveniences of <hi>Culture,</hi> and the Pleaſure of Walking; therefore we are now to regulate the ſpace that is to be allow'd before the <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> or flat Bordures, when any are made; to regulate the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Squares, and finally the place and breadth of the Walks of every <hi>Garden,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſize it be of.</p>
                        <p>When I ſhall ſpeak here of the Allies or Walks, I only mean the place deſtin'd for Walking, and nothing elſe, as ſome do, who in their Diſpoſition give the name of Walks to all the Space that lies from the Wall to the Dwarfs of the <hi>Counter Eſpalier</hi> or <hi>Polehedge,</hi> or the Diſtance that lies from one <hi>Dwarf</hi> to another in the Diviſion of the Squares or Ground Plats: This Space of Walks muſt never be narrower than five or ſix Foot, though the <hi>Garden</hi> be never ſo ſmall, and ought ſeldom to exceed Eighteen or Twenty, though the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> be never ſo large. This is what I had to ſay, as to the breadth, with this Proviſo, That in the firſt place every Walk muſt be more or leſs broad in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its length; and, in the ſecond place, that it muſt always be kept very ſmooth and gravell'd, and as firm as can be under Foot, otherwiſe it would not be convenient for Walking.</p>
                        <p>It will not be improper to declare here wherein the Difference between a Walk and a Path conſiſts: A Walk muſt be broad enough for two Perſons to walk a-breaſt at leaſt, and therefore cannot be allow'd leſs than five or ſix Foot; without which it would no longer be a real Walk, but a large Path; and, as to Paths, provided one perſon can go through them they are large enough, and therefore do not require above a Foot, or a Foot and a half at moſt in breadth.</p>

                           <p>Of the Diſpoſition or Diſtribution of a very ſmall <hi>Garden.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Proceed now to the particulars of every <hi>Garden,</hi> and ſay, That commonly there are but few <hi>Gardens</hi> that have not at leaſt five or ſix Fathom in breadth, with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable length, ſince the name of <hi>Garden</hi> could hardly be beſtow'd upon a narrower place; but however, whatever it be, it is certain, that ſuch a place being well ſituated, that is, in the Face of the Houſe, is a great Ornament to it, whether immediately joining to it, or divided by ſome ſmall Yard. In caſe then of ſuch a ſmall <hi>Garden,</hi> in my Opinion, in order to manage the <hi>Ground</hi> to the beſt Advantage, the Entrance muſt be made in the midſt of that breadth, with a Walk of about ſix Foot, which muſt be the only Walk, leaving only ſmall Paths along the Walls and Bordures, about a Foot broad; and in caſe the Entrance ſhould chance to be at one of the Corners, as ſometimes one is neceſſitated to make it, we muſt likewiſe be ſatisfied with one Walk along the firſt Wall which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf at that Corner; this Walk may chance to have the Sun one part of the Day, and be ſhaded the reſt, whereby it will be ſometimes pleaſant for walking.</p>
                        <p>If ſuch a <hi>Garden</hi> being five or ſix Fathom broad, ſhould happen to be as long again, it may very well be order'd, ſo as to contrive at every End, or, at leaſt, at one of them a Walk of an equal breadth with the former, eſpecially at that end which is neareſt to the Houſe, in which Caſe this walk may be allow'd a little more breadth than the other, which is an Obſervation the Practice whereof is very neceſſary in all kind of <hi>Gardens,</hi> eſpecially great ones, to the end, that as it is cuſtomary to ſtop at the Entrance of a <hi>Garden;</hi> to conſider it, a place may be found at firſt paſſably large, and conſequently agreeable and airy: Thoſe Walks at the ends will afford room for two or three diſterent or ſeparate Companies, which is a thing to be wiſh'd for.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this, I would have the Walks that are along the <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> or Walls, at leaſt at three or four Foot diſtance from the Walls, that the <hi>Trees</hi> may have at leaſt three or four Foot of <hi>Cultivated Earth,</hi> whereas their former allowance was not near ſo conſiderable, by which means this Bank being pretty large, as I would have it for all <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> even ſo as to make it yet much larger, in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> will not only be better nouriſh'd, but yet, beſides the Bordures which ſupport the <hi>Earth,</hi> and form an agreeable Figure in <hi>Gardens,</hi> ſome of thoſe uſeful <hi>Plants</hi> that delight in the Neighbourhood of Walls, may be planted in them; I mean ſuch as love to be ſhelter'd from cold dangerous Winds, which is a thing altogether neceſſary in order to have ſomething in the <hi>Spring.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Deſire every Body to reflect upon this Article, in which I adviſe them to place the Walks at a pretty diſtance from the <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> or Walls, by reaſon of the Advantages that may accrue from the ſhelter of the Walls, which ſhelter is of no uſe when it only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours Walks, which receive no benefit by it; for, in fine, what Inconvenience can attend the <hi>Cultivating</hi> of three or four Foot more to the right or left of the Walk, in reſpect to the good uſe that is to be made of the <hi>Mould</hi> of every <hi>Garden,</hi> whereas the three or four Foot I cauſe to be added to the ſmall Bank, to which <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> were commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, will be much more profitable in that place, than if being imploy'd to ſome part of the Walk, an equal quantity to it were <hi>Cultivated</hi> on the other ſide of that Walk, by reaſon that it could not enjoy the benefit of the ſhelter of the Wall.</p>
                        <p>I will not abſolutely decide, whether <hi>Dwarf Fruit-Trees</hi> ought to be planted in very ſmall <hi>Gardens,</hi> every Man is free in that to follow his own Inclination, though, in my Opinion, it were beſt to have none, unleſs they were ſmall <hi>Paradice Apple-Trees</hi> or <hi>Gooſeberry</hi> Shrubs; I ſhould fear thoſe <hi>Dwarfs</hi> might grow ſo large as to offuſcate or ſhadow the <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> or <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> which I have a particular reſpect for in this Place; beſides, they would certainly be inconvenient for walking, and take away the Beauty and Pleaſure of the Walk, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording it room to breathe in.</p>

                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48210:49"/>
Therefore I would employ the ſmallneſs of my <hi>Ground</hi> in other Things than <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> for Inſtance, in <hi>Strawberries, Sallads</hi> and <hi>Pot-herbs, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe one part one way, and the reſt of another, to have ſome little thing or other to pick at all times; and thus the whole ſpace of our little <hi>Garden,</hi> of which we have divided the breadth by one only Walk in the middle, or made it narrower by a walk along one of the Walls or <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> ſhould be cut croſs-wiſe by Beds about five or ſix Foot broad, with ſeveral ſmall Paths.</p>
                        <p>After having maturely examin'd the diſtribution I have now made, I find it ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I would make no other, though it were for a <hi>Garden</hi> of ſeven or eight Fathom broad, nay, not even of thoſe that conſiſt of eight or nine.</p>

                        <p>BUT if it were for a <hi>Garden</hi> of ten to eleven, or eleven to twelve Fathom, which compoſes a <hi>Garden</hi> of a moderate ſize, whether it has been thought fit in regard to its Situation, to place the Entrance of it at the middle, or elſe at one of the ſides; in both Caſes I would allow the Walks ſeven Foot in breadth, nay, I would even allow eight or nine to that which is parallel to the Front of the Houſe, leaving, as I have already ſaid, a Bank of about five or ſix foot for every Wall; ſo that in ſuch a Diſpoſition I ſhould only make Walks along all the Walls: and thus there would remain in the midſt of the <hi>Garden</hi> a ſquare about ſix or ſeven Fathom broad, or from ſeven to eight upon the whole length, and if that length ſhould chance to be about fifteen or twenty, or more, it would be fit to divide it into two equal parts by a Walk partly like that of the <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> or Walls; but I would not allow it above three Foot, that Square not being above ten or twelve Fathom long.</p>

                        <p>The Houſe not joyning to the <hi>Garden, Trees</hi> muſt be planted againſt all the Walls, the <hi>Garden</hi> being altogether inclos'd; nay, even though it were adjoyning, the Front being only plaiſter'd, or new pargetted; the ſame may be done, eſpecially to have the benefit of the breadth and of the height of the ſpace that lyes between the Windows, as well as of the lower part of the Windows; but if the Architecture be fine and rich, I would leave it naked and expos'd to the Eye of every body, ſince it would be a pitty to hide ſo fine an Ornament, through the hope of a little more <hi>Fruit.</hi>

length the <hi>Garden</hi> conſiſted of, I would allow five or ſix foot more than the reſt, nay, it might be allow'd twelve or more, it being a Terras, as it happens ſometimes, ſince the Terraſſes adjoyning to a I louſe can hardly ever be too broad.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the Walks we have mention'd round about our <hi>Garden,</hi> there ſhould be another in the middle to divide the breadth in two equal parts, and the breadth containing twenty Fathom, or a little more, it might be allow'd four or five foot more than thoſe that are Parallel to the Walls to the right and left, eſpecially this Walk fronting the entrance of the Houſe.</p>
                        <p>As to the length of our <hi>Garden,</hi> which we ſuppoſe to be from thirty to forty Fathom, it muſt be divided in two by a croſs Walk, almoſt about the ſame breadth with thoſe of the ſides, or only ſome feet leſs, conſidering the Extent is not ſo great, beſides that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is cloſer by the <hi>Trees</hi> that edge it to the right and left, than thoſe of its ſides, which being favour'd by the Banks, have more Air than that of the middle.</p>
                        <p>Such a Walk croſs-wiſe will form two Squares, which may have each about ſix or ſeven Fathom one way to nine, ten, or twelve on the other.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon I think it proper to ſay that a Square in any <hi>Garden</hi> whatever, always looks ſine, when it conſiſts of twelve or thirteen Fathom in length, and ſix, ſeven, or eight in breadth; and conſequently much more when it is in ſome meaſure equal on all ſides, and eſpecially when it is a little longer than broad.</p>
                        <p>If it ſhould happen at any time that going about to make a Walk on one of the ſides of the <hi>Garden,</hi> one ſhould meet with a Wall, which inſtead of being ſtrait, ſhould chance to be on a crooked Line in part of its extent, in ſuch a caſe, in which we muſt not pretead to correct that defect abſolutely, I am of Opinion ſtill to make the Walk regular with ſtrait Angels, that is, ſquare, beginning it at four foot diſtance from that part of the Wall which advances moſt into the Walk, and making it Square on the Extremity where it is to end, it ſhall be garniſh'd to the right and left with fine Bordures that ſhall mark it; and as for thoſe parts which ſhall chance to be much broader with <hi>Earth</hi> than they ſhould be according to our uſual Diſpoſition, it may be imploy'd uſefully either in <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> or other <hi>Plants,</hi> that are not capable to offuſcate the <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are ſometimes lengths of three or fourſcore Fathom, and even more to eighteen or twenty in breadth, which we are ſpeaking of, in which caſe that length muſt needs be divided into three or four equal Portions by croſs Walks; and whereas ſuch a length bears no Proportion to the breadth, I would ſtop the Proſpect of our <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> within forty or fifty Fathom from the Houſe by ſome Wall, or, at leaſt, by ſome Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſade; ſuch a Wall might be proper to multiply the <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> or <hi>Wall-Fruit,</hi> or that Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade for <hi>Grapes,</hi> or other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and thus we ſhould gain on all ſides, either as to the Advantage of Production, or the Pleaſure of the Eye.</p>
                        <p>Although the ſpace of a <hi>Garden</hi> ſhould contain five and twenty, thirty, or thirty five Fathom in breadth, I would make no other diſtribution of it, than what we have already made to a breadth of fifteen or twenty, unleſs it were to make the Walks ſomewhat broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in proportion to their length.</p>

                           <p>Of the Diſpoſition or Diſtribution of <hi>Gardens</hi> of an extraordinary ſize.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IF the breadth of ſuch a <hi>Garden</hi> ſhould amount to threeſcore, threeſcore and ten, or fourſcore Fathom, or more; I would divide it into four equal Portions, as I have done at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and in ſeveral other <hi>Kitchen-Gardens;</hi> or elſe I would make Counter-Walks garniſh'd with <hi>Dwarfs</hi> upon the flat Bordures, as I have done at <hi>Rambouillet</hi> for his Grace the Duke of <hi>Montauſier,</hi> upon condition that in thoſe two Caſes the two Walks pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Chief, which we ſuppoſe in the middle, about three Fathom broad, ſhould not be allow'd above eight or nine foot: In my Opinion, it were a pitty to make them broader, ſince that would employ too much Ground in Walks.</p>
                        <p>We have already mention'd the bigneſs the Squares of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of, and thus without repeating it, we will find that thoſe two Walks will afford us fine ones, either as to their breadth or length; for the ſame Rule we preſcribe for the dividing of the breadth, muſt ſerve for the diviſion of the length, and we muſt needs be perſuaded at all times that when a ſpace of <hi>Garden</hi> approaches fourſcore Fathom
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48210:50"/>
in breadth, and paſſes them in length, as the great Square of the King's <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> does; it really compoſes a large <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> ſince it contains at leaſt ſeven or eight Acres of Ground, in which caſe the Squares may have fourteen or fifteen Fathom one way, to eighteen or twenty on the other.</p>
                        <p>I do not think there is any neceſſity of inlarging farther in what relates to the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or Diſtribution of the <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens;</hi> what we have already ſaid ſuffices, which is that when one may have or afford variety of ſuch <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> as Princes or great Lords do, who have occaſion for them, it is proper to make little particular <hi>Gardens</hi> in Places adjacent to the great one, as I have done at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> at <hi>Seaux,</hi> at St. <hi>Oüen, &amp;c.</hi> or round about the great one, as I have done at <hi>Verſailles;</hi> or elſe the Overplus of the Place we would have <hi>Cultivated,</hi> muſt be employ'd in <hi>High Standard Trees;</hi> for to ſpeak the Truth, over large <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> are attended with great Inconveniences, and liable to great Charges, which very often do not anſwer our Expectations for want of due Cares.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>ALthough this <hi>Culture</hi> taken in the whole, contains all what we have Explain'd in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular Treatiſes, my Intention, notwithſtanding, is to reduce it here to Three Things only: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the <hi>Tillage</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> ſtands in need of; <hi>Secondly,</hi> to the Neatneſs <hi>Gardens</hi> require at all times. The remainder of the <hi>Culture</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall be examin'd in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Kitchen-Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore we muſt conclude, that as the <hi>Earth,</hi> as often as it is hot and moiſt, always finds it ſelf in an approaching diſpoſition to Act, that is, of producing ſome <hi>Plants</hi> good or bad, and ſometimes of no uſe for Man, becauſe it can, as it were, never remain Idle, the <hi>Production</hi> it makes of one thing, muſt of neceſſity be prejudicial to another.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Interior Salt of it; that is, its Fertility, or Capacity of Acting is no wiſe Infinite, and is exhauſted by often producing, as every Body knows: So that ſeveral <hi>Plants</hi> lying near one another, it always happens that all, or a great part of them grow the ſmaller, becauſe that which was to ſerve for the Nouriſhment of all, being divided into many, the ſhare of each muſt of neceſſity be the ſmaller, and the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all of them the ſlenderer, or elſe it happens that ſome of them being more lively, either by being grown Naturally, or being of a Temper more ſuitable to that part of the <hi>Earth</hi> which nouriſhes them; this <hi>Plant</hi> has ſuck'd a greater quantity of the Nouriſhment that was in that Place ready prepar'd for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> than any of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>It is not only the Inſide of that <hi>Earth</hi> which appears exhauſted to us in its <hi>Productions,</hi> when too great a quantity of different <hi>Plants</hi> have exhauſted it by their <hi>Roots;</hi> we ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that this <hi>Earth</hi> is dry and wants Moiſture, when it is hindred from receiving the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Night-Dews, and of thoſe ſmall Show'rs which have the Gift of repairing and amending that <hi>Earth,</hi> provided they may be able to penetrate to the Internal Parts; thus when the <hi>Leaves</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Plants,</hi> which cover the <hi>Ground,</hi> come to receive thoſe kind of Moiſtures, they hinder them from deſcending lower, and ſo they remain expos'd to the <note place="margin">Exigua tantum gelidus ros no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte reponet. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Sun,</hi> which rarifying them as ſoon as it lightens and heats them, converts them into Vapours, and ſo conſequently for that time prevents their being of any uſe to that <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that when we would have our <hi>Trees,</hi> and particularly our <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Tall Standards</hi> well fed, and conſequently very Vigorous, and thereby agreeable to ſight, we muſt take care.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they be not too near one another, to the end that the Nouriſhment may be the leſs divided.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there may be no ſort of <hi>Plants</hi> near them, which may inwardly ſteal their Nouriſhment, or outwardly hinder the Refreſhings and Helps they are certainly to receive by Rain and Dew.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Care muſt be taken to keep the <hi>Earth</hi> always light, and conſequently often <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated,</hi> as well that the Moiſtures of Rains and Dews may eaſily, and the ſooner, penetrate to the <hi>Roots,</hi> as that the <hi>Earth</hi> may be duly heated by the Rays of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which it ſtands indiſpenſibly in need of.</p>

Now to put that <hi>Earth</hi> in a Condition of producing advantageouſly what we require of it, without allowing it time to imploy it ſelf in other Things, as alſo to preſerve clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the whole extent, we muſt be careful to <hi>Till</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> to amend and cleanſe it when it requires it.

                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>TIllage,</hi> properly ſpeaking, is nothing but a Movement or Stirring, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd on the Surface of the <hi>Ground</hi> penetrates unto a certain Depth, and makes the lower and upper parts reciprocally change place: Now it not being my Intention, to ſpeak in this Place of the <hi>Tillage</hi> that is perform'd with a <hi>Plough</hi> in the open Fields, but only of the <hi>Tillage</hi> of our <hi>Gardens,</hi> it is proper to know that it is perform'd ſeveral different ways.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> With the Spade and Haugh in eaſie <hi>Grounds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> Place, with a Pitch-Fork, and <hi>French</hi> Mattock in ſtony and yet pretty ſtrong <hi>Ground;</hi> ſome are perform'd deeper; for Inſtance, in the open <hi>Ground,</hi> and in the middle of the Squares or Plats; and others lighter, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Foot of <hi>Trees,</hi> upon <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> among ſmall <hi>Legumes, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It muſt be noted next, that in all likelihood the Cauſe or Motive of <hi>Tillage,</hi> is not only to make the <hi>Earths</hi> appear more agreeable to ſight, though they really thereby become ſo; but that it is, in the firſt place, to render ſuch eaſie as are not ſo, or to preſerve thoſe in a good Caſe that are ſo naturally; and, in the ſecond place, that it is chiefly thereby to augment Fertility in ſuch <hi>Earths</hi> as have but little, or to preſerve it in ſuch as have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Store: <hi>Earths</hi> that are abſolutely barren, muſt not be <hi>Till'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I talk of rendring <hi>Earth</hi> eaſie, I mean to make it become ſandy and looſe, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, <note place="margin">Et cui putre ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum (namque hoc imi tamur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando.) <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> that the Moiſture and Heat which comes from without, may eaſily penetrate through it, and that it may be no wiſe compact or ſticking together, like clayiſh, gravelly <hi>Earth,</hi> which by the Conſtitution of their Nature, are no wiſe proper for <hi>Vegetation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when I ſpeak of endeavouring to give Fruitfulneſs, I mean, that the <hi>Tillage</hi> muſt <note place="margin">Optima putri arva ſolo; id venti curant, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidaeque pruinae, &amp; labefacta mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, robuſtus jugera foſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> contribute to give a temper of Heat and Moiſture to a <hi>Soil,</hi> that is already provided with that Salt, it ſtands in need of for the chief part of Fertility; this temper of Heat and Moiſture being ſo neceſſary to the <hi>Earth,</hi> that without it its Salt is altogether uſeleſs, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it can produce no manner of <hi>Plants,</hi> in the ſame manner as <hi>Animals</hi> can enjoy no perfect Health, without the temper of Elemental Qualifications.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough to have given Reaſons for the Cauſe of <hi>Tillage,</hi> we muſt beſides give <note place="margin">Prima Ceres ferro mortales vertere terram inſtituit, cum jam glandes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que arbuta ſacrae deficerent ſilvae, &amp; victum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona negaret. <hi>Georg.</hi> 1.</note> Rules, that may ſerve to procure this Temper in queſtion to <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon which, I ſay, that it is obſervable, that ſome <hi>Earths</hi> are eaſily heated; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuch as are light, to which we have but little to do in Relation to heat; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are commonly dry and parch'd, we muſt work carefully to procure them Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: Others are not eaſily heated; for Inſtance, thoſe that are Strong and Cold; and thoſe require but little <hi>Culture</hi> for an augmentation of Moiſture; on the contrary, they have generally too much of it; but they require a great deal of help for an additional Heat.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, ſome kind of <hi>Plants</hi> require more Moiſture; for Example, <hi>Artichokes, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads,</hi>

The Sun, Rains and Subterranean Waters provide for one part, and we ought to provide, by other means, for what may be wanting beſides; which is, what we do by a well underſtood <hi>Culture,</hi> of which <hi>Tillage</hi> is one of the chief Parts.</p>

                        <p>The Nature of the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhews us in this, as well as in many other Things, that it will be order'd regularly, ſo that it anſwers our Intentions with ſucceſs, when it is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manag'd; whereas, on the contrary, it oppoſes them when it is govern'd Ill: The Seaſon of putting moſt <hi>Coin</hi> into the <hi>Ground,</hi> which commonly are only ſown each in one Seaſon, the time of <hi>Graffing,</hi> of <hi>Pruning</hi> and of <hi>Planting Vines</hi> as well as <hi>Trees, &amp;c.</hi> which likewiſe is only done in certain Months; all theſe, I ſay, are ſo many Inſtructions which Nature gives us, in order to teach us how to ſtudy well what the <hi>Ground</hi> requires, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely at what time.

                        </p>
                        <p>From what I have ſaid heretofore to favour the Nouriſhment of our <hi>Trees,</hi> it follows, that I condemn thoſe who <hi>Sow</hi> or <hi>Plant,</hi> either many <hi>Pot-herhs,</hi> or <hi>Strawberries,</hi> or <hi>Flowers,</hi> near the Foot of their <hi>Trees,</hi> ſuch <hi>Plants</hi> being certainly very prejudicial to them.</p>
                        <p>The Rule I Practiſe for the <hi>Culture</hi> or <hi>Tillage,</hi> that is to be perform'd about our <hi>Trees,</hi> as well in the Winter as in the Spring, in dry light <hi>Earths,</hi> is to allow them a large one at the Entrance of the Winter, and the like as ſoon as it is paſt, to the end that the Rains and Snows of the Winter, and the Rains of the Spring, may eaſily penetrate into our <hi>Earth;</hi> and as for the ſtrong and moiſt <hi>Earths,</hi> I give them a ſmall <hi>Tillage</hi> in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> only to remove the Weeds, and tarry to give them a large one at the end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> when the <hi>Fruit</hi> is abſolutely knit, and the great Moiſtures over; thus the Surface of that <hi>Earth</hi> being kept hard, firm and cloſe, has left but little paſſage for the Waters of the Winter and Spring, which we have no occaſion here, for the Snow being melted, without having been capable of penetrating, remains part upon the Surface, where it is converted into Vapors, and the reſt following the Declivities of the Place, deſcends into the Neighbouring Rivers.</p>
                        <p>I muſt needs ſay, in this Place, that nothing moiſtens ſo much, and penetrates ſo far as the Water of melted Snow. I have ſeldom known Water to penetrate above a foot deep, whereas the Water of Snow will penetrate two or three Foot, as well becauſe it is heavier than common Rain Water, as by reaſon, that as it melts ſlowly and by degrees, and from the undermoſt part of the Maſs of Snow, it ſoaks in with more eaſe, without being hindred by the Wind, or by the heat of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as much as I dread abundance of Snow upon ſtrong, moiſt Grounds, and cauſe it to be remov'd from about our <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> I like it, and cauſe it to be gather'd in dry <hi>Earths,</hi> there to make a kind of Magazine of Moiſture; and eſpecially in thoſe

                           <p>Of Amendments or Improvements.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFTER having explain'd the Motive, Uſe and Manner of <hi>Tillage,</hi> we muſt do the ſame thing about Amendments, which are nothing but a bettering, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of <hi>Earth;</hi> we have already ſaid, that this Improvement might be done with all manner of <hi>Dung,</hi> of which we muſt now explain the Motive, Uſe and Manner.</p>
                        <p>As to the Motive, it is likewiſe certain, that when we amend, or Dung the Ground, it is with an Intention of affording Fruitfulneſs to that which wants it, that is, that which has many defects, and conſequently little Diſpoſition towards Production; or elſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it when it has it, and might loſe it, unleſs it received from time to time ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Reparations, according to the Productions we require of it, either beyond its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or conformably to its Power; and likewiſe to amend it more or leſs, according to its Temper, whether good or bad: For <hi>Example,</hi> There muſt be a great deal of Dung to produce <hi>Pot-herbs,</hi> which grow in a ſhort time abundantly, and ſucceed each other quickly in a ſmall compaſs of Ground, which without that might grow barren; on the other hand, <hi>Trees</hi> require but little or none for their Nouriſhment, by reaſon that being long a-growing, they make but inconſiderable Productions, compar'd to the Ground they take up: and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Though they remain long in one and the ſame Place, yet by means of their <hi>Roots</hi> which ſtretch out to the right and left, they make a ſhift to pick up the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment that is proper for them, far and near: I add, that the <hi>Earth</hi> which has a great deal of Fruitfulneſs in it ſelf, requires leſs than that which has but little; and <hi>Finally,</hi> Cold moiſt <hi>Earth</hi> requires more than thoſe that are hot and dry.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, and no body can be ignorant of it, the great defects of <hi>Earth</hi> conſiſts, as I have already ſaid, either in too much moiſture, which is commonly accompany'd with cold, and great ponderouſneſs, or elſe in too much drought, which is likewiſe regularly accompany'd with an exceſſive lightneſs, and a great Diſpoſition to parching; We like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe find that among the Dungs we may imploy, ſome are too fat and cooling, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Dung of Oxen and Cows; and the other too hot and light, for <hi>Example,</hi> the Dung of Sheep, Horſes and Pidgeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whereas the Remedy muſt have Vertues oppoſite or contrary to the Diſtempers it is to cure; we muſt imploy hot and dry Dungs in moiſt, cold, heavy <hi>Earth,</hi> in order to heat them, and make them lighter and eaſier; and Oxen and Cow Dung in lean, dry, light <hi>Earths,</hi> to make them fatter, and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, thereby hindring the great parchings or droughts of the Spring, and the great heats of the Summer from drying them up with too much eaſe.</p>

There are at this time great Controverſies in Philoſophy and Chimiſtry, to endeavour to decide which are the beſt <hi>Dungs,</hi> and that with the ſame exactneſs or accuracy Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians uſe in deciding what is neceſſary to form a ſtraight Line, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The World is certainly highly oblig'd to thoſe Gentlemen, who drive their Curioſity and their Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations ſo far into the Secrets of Nature; I hope, we may reap great benefits by it, but in the mean time, I am of Opinion for my ſelf, and for thoſe for whom I write, that we can do no better than to proceed in this as I do, orderly, plainly and groſly, being perſuaded that the fertility of <hi>Earth</hi> does not conſiſt, as, I may ſay, in an indiviſible Point; and indeed I am ſo far from being willing to occaſion the leaſt ſcruple in any body, and <note place="margin">Fundit humo facilem victum juſtiſſima tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>To which end, I think I may ſay once more, that we may form to our ſelves a certain Idea of richneſs in <hi>Earth,</hi> which certainly contains in its Bowels a Salt which occaſions Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, and that this Salt is the only and real Treaſure of this <hi>Earth.</hi> Thus we ſay, <hi>That the Money of a Miſer</hi> (which makes his Riches and Plenty) <hi>is the Treaſure he poſſeſſes;</hi> yet this Miſer will ſtill remain equally Rich and Pecuniary: If, in the firſt place, he ſpends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or, if in the ſecond place, whatever Liberality he may affect, it happens ſo that he conſtantly receives as much Gold and Silver in one hand, as he ſpends with the other; he ſpent yeſterday fifty Shillings, to day he has increas'd his Store, either in Gold, Silver, or Goods, to the value of the ſame Summ; he is then equally Rich, ſo that to morrow he ſhall be able to ſpend the ſame Summ, and to take up the next day, either the ſame Money in Bond, which is not common, or the value, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus, <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is real and effective.</p>
                        <p>We muſt know for certain, that <hi>Earth</hi> has been created with a Diſpoſition to produce <note place="margin">Germinet terra herbam viten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp;c. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Plants,</hi> and that (excepting ſome Stones and Mettals which are extraordinary Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature) there is nothing on the Earth which is not come out of its own Boſom, and that by the way of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and conſequently all the <hi>Vegetative Plants</hi> we ſee are part of that <hi>Earth,</hi> and thus we may affirm that there is nothing (whatever it may be, provided it be material) but what may ſerve to amend that <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Soil</hi> returning to it by way of Corruption, under whatever Figure it returns to it; becauſe that whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enters into that <hi>Earth,</hi> gives it back in ſome manner what it had loſt, either in the ſame <hi>Specie,</hi> or in Value, and in effect it becomes <hi>Earth</hi> again, as it was before; thus all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Stuffs, Linnen, the Fleſh, Skin, Bones and Nails of Animals, Dirt, Urines, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, the Wood of <hi>Trees,</hi> their <hi>Fruit,</hi> their <hi>Leaves,</hi> Aſhes, Straw, all manner of Corn or Grains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſhort, all in general that is palpable and ſenſible on <hi>Earth</hi> (excepting perhaps as I have already ſaid, moſt Stones, and all Minerals) all this entring into the <hi>Ground,</hi> ſerves to amend and better it, ſo that having the Convenience and Facility of ſpreading often upon <hi>Earths,</hi> as we have it in good Farms, and particularly in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Cities, as it is practis'd for the ſowing of <hi>Corn,</hi> and for <hi>Legumes,</hi> we put our Land in a Condition of being able to continue to produce always without Intermiſſion.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, our <hi>Ground,</hi> though good, not being permitted to produce, for Inſtance, ſuch as are built upon; thoſe <hi>Grounds</hi> thus cover'd with Buildings, are, though againſt their Will, like a Rich Man who ſpends nothing, though able to ſpend much; they always remain, as the Philoſophers ſay, equally Fertile in Power, that is, equally capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and would actually produce, if they were not hindred from ſo doing; as to the others which produce at all times, if in <hi>Tilling</hi> of them, the <hi>Plants</hi> they had produc'd be again put underneath them, as it happens often, eſpecially in thoſe parts that are the Seat of War; thoſe <hi>Plants</hi> thus put under the Surface of that <hi>Earth</hi> rot there, and ſerve to fatten it again to the ſame degree it poſſeſs'd before the producing of them, or elſe we may ſay, that it is the ſame Salt in <hi>Specie,</hi> which returns to it, and makes it as Rich, that is, as Fertile as it was before.</p>
                        <p>And when all the Productions of ſuch a ſpot of <hi>Ground</hi> are taken away, as it is very uſual, and that in lieu thereof it be allow'd as many of the Productions of another place, and that by means of rotten Straw, ſeaſon'd, as it were, with the Excrements of ſome Animals, which Excrements are likewiſe originally ſprung from the <hi>Earth,</hi> and make a part of it, that <hi>Earth</hi> having thereby repaired its loſs, becomes as Rich, that is, as Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile as before.</p>
                        <p>We may then in ſome manner look upon Dungs in relation to <hi>Earth,</hi> as a kind of Coin which repairs the Treaſures of that <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as there are ſeveral kind of Coins, ſome more precious, others leſs, but ſtill, both the one and the other being Coin'd, paſs in Trade and Inrich; ſo there are ſeveral kind of Dungs, ſome a little better than others, but ſtill all proper to amend, that is, to repair
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48210:52"/>
the loſs that <hi>Earth</hi> had ſuſtained in Producing; and thus the Subſtance of the <hi>Earth</hi> does not wear out to be at laſt reduc'd to nothing, or waſte ſo as to give cauſe to ſay, that it diminiſhes, for if it did, where ſhould it be now, after having produc'd ſo much from the beginning of the World? 'Tis only the Salt of it that diminiſhes; or to ſpeak more properly, changes place, which, as it may return, as it does, is capable of reſtoring that <hi>Earth</hi> to the ſame Condition it was in formerly.</p>
                        <p>The Alambicks in Chimiſtry ſufficiently manifeſt what that Salt is, and ſhow in little what a ſmall quantity of it is required to animate a pretty conſiderable quantity of <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon which, I think I may ſay, that Dung ſeems to be in relation to <hi>Earths</hi> that are of a different Temper, what Salt is in relation to different kinds of Meat, either ſuch as are fine and curious, as <hi>Partridges</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> and ſuch as are material and groſs, as <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Pork, &amp;c.</hi> theſe without doubt can bear a much larger quantity of Salt in the ſeaſoning of them, without ſpoiling, than the others, ſince a good piece of <hi>Beef,</hi> without doubt, requires a much greater quantity of Salt to reliſh it, than a piece of <hi>Mutton,</hi> though equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly large; and indeed groſs Meats are made more pallatable by being well poudred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Mutton</hi> being ſalted at the ſame rate, would be ſpoil'd.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, as there are ſome Salts that ſalt more, for Inſtance, <hi>Bay-Salt,</hi> and others leſs, as white Salt; ſo as to the heating, or animating of <hi>Earth,</hi> there are ſome Dungs which heat and amend more; for Inſtance, thoſe of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Horſes,</hi> and others that amend and heat leſs; for <hi>Example,</hi> The Dung of Hogs and Cows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt prudently make uſe both of the one and the other; Experience ſufficiently juſtifies this faculty of heating in point of Dungs, in that a certain quantity of Horſe Dung heap'd up together will cauſe a conſiderable heat, even to that degree, as to convert it ſelf ſometimes into real Fire, whereas a heap of Cow Dung never heats it ſelf to that degree.</p>
                        <p>And, therefore, ſhould a great deal of Horſe and Sheeps Dung be laid in light, ſandy <note place="margin">Arida tantum ne ſaturare fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo pingui pude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ſola, &amp;c. <hi>Georg.</hi> 1.

                           <hi>Earths,</hi> which ſtand in no need of ſo much heat, it would prejudice them inſtead of doing them good; thoſe Dungs are too burning; but according to the Advice of the Poet, we might allow them a great deal of Cows-Dung, which is fatter, and not ſo hot: And on the contrary, what is not ſit for dry, hot <hi>Earths,</hi> is very proper for ſuch as are cold and moiſt; thoſe, which naturally produce but too many Weeds, want heat to be animated, as it were, to diſpoſe them, to produce others that are better for us.</p>

                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48210:53"/>
Neither can any body be ignorant that thoſe who keep thoſe Animals both for Pleaſure and Uſe, have particular Places for them to feed and reſt in; which Places have peculiar and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Names; they are call'd Stables for Horſes and Mules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Pens, Stalls and Sties for Oxen, Cows, Sheep and Hogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Great Hunters have, beſides, Kennels for Hounds, but thoſe afford but little of what we treat of in this Chapter. It is uſual to place daily under thoſe Animals, and particularly under Horſes, a ſufficient quantity of freſh New Straw, well ſpread, which is call'd making of Litter, which is, as it were, a kind of Bed, which ſerves for them to lye upon, and take their reſt, when they are weary, to put themſelves again in a Condition to go about their uſual Service a-new; this Litter ſerves then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Health, to help to recover their Vigor, as well as to keep them neater, and more agreeable to ſight.</p>
                        <p>But that is not all, for after that it muſt be good for ſome other thing; this Straw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus imploy'd by the Name of Litter, becomes not only bruis'd and broken by the Trampling and Agitation of thoſe Animals, but their Excrements having imbib'd or ſoak'd it, changes the colour of it, and half rots it, ſo that it becomes, as it were, of a different Nature from what it was; and being altogether corrupted, and no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſerve for Litter, there is a neceſſity of removing it, to put new into the room of it, which in its turn muſt undergo the ſame Fate.</p>
                        <p>This firſt Litter being taken from under thoſe Animals, and laid aſide, is not look'd upon as a heap of common Dirt, to be rejected, we give it the name of <hi>Dung,</hi> now in queſtion; and under that Name, it is found to be, not only a uſeful, but a very neceſſary thing for the good of Human kind.</p>
                        <p>Now that which is the Cauſe of this new Service it yields, being grown <hi>Dung,</hi> is, that the Excrements of thoſe Animals have communicated unto it a certain quality, or rather a certain Salt, which being contain'd in it, cauſes it (being heapt up) to heat it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, and at the ſame time to heat all that is round about it, as we ſhall explain more at large hereafter.</p>
                        <p>After having thus explain'd what <hi>Dung</hi> is, if it may be truly ſaid that that Explication was not very neceſſary, at leaſt it muſt be allow'd, that the other four Articles are very material to be explain'd, beginning by that which is to give us an Account how many ſorts of <hi>Dung</hi> we may uſe.</p>
                        <p>It naturally follows from what I have ſaid above, that as there are many Horſes every where, there likewiſe is a great deal of Horſe <hi>Dung,</hi> and a little of Mules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there <note place="margin">The variety of <hi>Dungs.</hi>
                           </note> is a great deal of Cows, and that Sheep and Hogs afford a ſmall quantity, we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſay that the Poultry that is kept in ſome Houſes, as Pigions, Hens, Geeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo produce ſome ſmall manner of <hi>Dung,</hi> but it is ſo very inconſiderable, that it is hardly worth mentioning.</p>
                        <p>The great Animals in queſtion do not alone contribute by their Excrements, to the Compoſition of <hi>Dungs,</hi> and the Amendments of the <hi>Earth,</hi> all the parts of their Bodies being once rotten, nay, their very Nails and Bones ſerve to fatten it. The Leaves of <hi>Trees</hi> which are gather'd in <hi>Autumn,</hi> being put in a moiſt Place, and eſpecially under the drein of a Stable or Pen, being alſo rotten, may likewiſe be of ſome uſe in Places where Straw and Animals are not common.</p>
                        <p>The very Aſhes of all combuſtible Matters are of a very good uſe in this Caſe, for the ſmall quantity that can be had of them, and not only Aſhes, but alſo rotten Wood, and generally all things which being come out of the Earth, are corruptible, becomes <hi>Dung</hi> for the Ground, when put into it again, and there corrupts.</p>
                        <p>Nay, there are ſome People, who, in order to multiply the number of <hi>Dungs</hi> or Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, maintain, that Turf, and the Earth of high Ways is proper for it; I will ſpeak my Opinion of it in the Sequel, and will only ſay in this Place, that that kind of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh <hi>Earth</hi> which is met with in the Bowels of ſome piece of Grounds, which we call Marle, and ſeems to be inclin'd to become Stones, muſt be conſider'd as an amendment to help towards the Production of ſome things, as I will explain in the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>Now we have explain'd the diverſity of <hi>Dungs,</hi> it will be proper to ſee what are their particular Qualifications, to the end that this knowledge may teach us to make a good <note place="margin">The choice of <hi>Dung.</hi>
                           </note> Choice according to the occaſions we have for it.</p>
                        <p>There are two peculiar Properties in the Caſe of <hi>Dungs;</hi> the one is to fatten, that is, to fatten the <hi>Earth,</hi> and better it, or render it more fruitful, and that is common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Dung,</hi> being well rotten, only ſome more, and others leſs: The ſecond Property is to produce a certain ſenſible heat, capable of producing ſome conſiderable Effect: The Ancients knew the firſt, and have not known the ſecond; this laſt is ſeldom met with in any but Horſe and Mule <hi>Dung,</hi> when newly made, and ſtill a little moiſt, and indeed thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48210:53"/>
ſort of <hi>Dungs</hi> are of a wonderful uſe in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> and particularly in the Winter; at which time they ſeem to perform the Office of the great Planet, which animates and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s all things, really performing there the ſame Function which the heat of the Sun is us'd to diſpenſe there in the Summer; as for Inſtance, being laid in the form of Couches, it ſerves to afford us all the Novelties of the Spring, <hi>viz. Cowcumbers, Radiſhes,</hi> ſmall <hi>Sallads,</hi> and <hi>Melons,</hi> and all that, long before Nature can give it; it ſerves in great Froſts to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with <hi>Greens</hi> and <hi>Flowers,</hi> and that which is yet more ſingular, very green <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> and thoſe better than the Common ones; it likewiſe ſerves to advance conſiderably the Maturity of <hi>Strawberries,</hi> of <hi>Figs</hi> in Caſes, <hi>Peaſe, &amp;c.</hi> and finally, it ſerves to make Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms grow at all times.</p>
                        <p>And if new Dung has a peculiar Goodneſs and Faculty, when it ſtands poſſeſs'd of its firſt heat, it has another when, without being Rotten, it is old and dry, the heat being altogether paſt, which is to preſerve againſt, or from, Cold, that which Froſts might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage and deſtroy; and therefore it is us'd in the Winter time to cover <hi>Fig-Trees, Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, Succories, Selery, &amp;c.</hi> Which are all <hi>Manna's</hi> of great Value in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> which would periſh without the help of Dung to cover them: Which is not all that Dung is uſeful for; for, after having ſerv'd in ſo many Places, as according to the Condition of all Sublunary Beings, it rots at laſt; it then ſerves again to the laſt Uſe which I treat of here, and that is, to amend the Ground.</p>
                        <p>This Amendment or Improvement ſuppoſes two conſiderable Conditions, the one rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the time which is proper for the doing of it, and the other to the manner of doing it well.</p>
                        <p>As to the time, we muſt not imagin that all the Seaſons of the Year are proper to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <note place="margin">Proper times to turn <hi>Earth.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Dung,</hi> none but the five moiſteſt Months of the Year are good for it, <hi>viz.</hi> from the beginning of <hi>November</hi> till towards the end of <hi>March;</hi> thoſe <hi>Dungs</hi> would be of no uſe in the boſom of the <hi>Earth,</hi> unleſs they perfectly made an end of rotting there, and nothing but Rain can cauſe that Conſummation; thoſe that are employ'd at other times, only grow dry and muſty, and ſo far from being favourable to Vegetabels, they are pernicious and fatal to them, eſpecially when there is a conſiderable quantity of it; abundance of large white Worms engendring in it, which remain in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and gnaw all the tender things they meet with; whereas the great Moiſtures of Autumn and Winter making an end of rotting by the degrees, the groſs material ſubſtance of that <hi>Dung,</hi> the Salt which lyes in it, paſſes into the interior parts of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and thus this Salt ſpreads it ſelf in thoſe Places, whence the <hi>Plants</hi> draw their Nouriſhment, that is, in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Roots,</hi> which alone have the Tallent of improving the benefit of <hi>Dung,</hi> and thereby <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables</hi> make an end of acquiring all the Perfection, which is proper for them, as thickneſs, largneſs, and the reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It follows then, that the <hi>Winter</hi> is the only Seaſon fit for great Amendments; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves able <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> not to loſe a time which is ſo precious for their Occupation: In order to which, they need neither to mind the Quarters of the Moon, nor the Winds, whatever they be, notwithſtanding the Traditions of ſome of the Ancients, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſaid in ſome Books of <hi>Gard'ning;</hi> they are only troubleſom Obſervations, and altogether Uſeleſs, and are only proper to afford Matter towards the Imbelliſhment of Poetry, or, perhaps, to ſet off ſome Viſionary talkative <hi>Gard'ners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us now proceed to the manner of Employing this Dung to the purpoſe: This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought to afford us two Inſtructions; the one is to point out thoſe Parts where the Dung is to be laid, and the ſecond to mark out partly the true quantity.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, it is to be noted, that ſometimes there is a neceſſity of Dunging largely, and pretty deep into the Ground, and ſometimes it ſuffices to turn the Surface lightly. As to the firſt, I am not of the Opinion of thoſe who make Beds of their Dung at the Bottom of Trenches, whatever care they take of Tilling every Bed largely, in order to mix the Earth and Dung together, and my Reaſon, confirm'd by a long Experience, is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good in that Dung, ſo employ'd, ſoon becomes Uſeleſs, ſince it paſſes too low with the Moiſtures which force it along, and drive it to ſuch Parts where the <hi>Roots</hi> cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate, beſides that the Motion which is made in Tilling thoſe Three or Four Beds in the Trenches, inſtead of contributing to make the Earth lighter; which is one of the <note place="margin">Et cui putre ſolum. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> moſt material Conditions, only preſſes and hardens it by the Trampling, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided in Tilling.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as I have already ſaid elſewhere, I would have the Dung uſed for <hi>Earth,</hi> in the ſame Manner as Aſhes are us'd in Waſhing, that is, that whereas the Aſhes are only laid upon the Surface of the Linen, that is heaped up in the Tub, in order to cleanſe it; ſo the Dung ſhould only be laid on the Surface of the <hi>Earth</hi> that is to be Amended. I ſay
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48210:54"/>
it again, it is not the groſs Subſtance of the Dung which Fertiliſes, as it is not the groſs Subſtance of the Aſhes which cleanſes, it is that inviſible Salt which is contain'd in thoſe Matters, Incorporating, wetted with the Waters that wet it, deſcends with them, whereever their Weight inclines them, and there produces what it is capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming.</p>
                        <p>But it is not ſufficient to know the beſt Place where the Dung is to be laid, we muſt likewiſe examine what quantity may be proper for it: In order to explain this Article, it is proper to know that as ſome Dungs have a far greater quantity of Salt to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate than others; ſo there are <hi>Earths</hi> which require and want more Amendments than others: I ſtill mean the <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> and not that <hi>Earth</hi> in which <hi>Trees</hi> are to be Planted; for I will have none for theſe, ſuppoſing always that if they have the leaſt <note place="margin">No <hi>Dung</hi> for <hi>Trees.</hi>
                           </note> Goodneſs they have enough to Nouriſh <hi>Trees,</hi> from which we expect Pallatable Fruit. He who ſtudies to make Excellent Wine, ſoon perceives that the uſe of Dung is directly contrary to his Intention, and that if thoſe Amendments augment the quantity, at the ſame time it diminiſhes the Value, though perhaps that defect might have been corrected by Fermentation and Boiling; Therefore have we not yet much more cauſe to fear for the Taſte of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which, without the Advantages of Boiling, are to be tranſmitted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the <hi>Tree,</hi> to the Mouth?</p>
                        <p>And when the <hi>Earth</hi> is naught, I can not, as I have already ſaid, forbear blaming thoſe who loſe their Time in Planting there, inſtead of getting better <hi>Earth</hi> brought there, the quantity cannot be Conſiderable, nor conſequently the Charge, conſidering that none will go about to Plant many <hi>Trees</hi> in ill Grounds.</p>
                        <p>But if, contrary to my Sentiment in this particular Caſe of Planting of <hi>Trees,</hi> People will be obſtinate in dunging of Trenches, where they intend to Plant, I am willing to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Manner I think moſt proper for it, to ſave Charges, and to have the Work better done and ſooner.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe, for Inſtance, that a Trench ſix Foot deep is to be prepar'd, either along a Wall to plant againſt it, or about a Square to plant <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> Firſt, I would have the quantity of Dung one has Examin'd, either Horſe or Cow Dung, which are the two ſorts that are moſt Commonly us'd, and which are moſt plentiful; this Knowledge will teach us whether we may uſe a great deal or not: After this I would have it laid in equal diſtances, all along the Trench that is to be made, and the overture of the Trench dug three Foot deep, and about a Fathom upon the breadth propos'd, ſo that before we go about to employ the Dung, we may have an empty free Space before us; I would likewiſe have three Men, two with Spades to ſtir the Ground, and one with a Pitch-fork for the Dung; and laſtly, I would have two of them take that <hi>Earth</hi> that is to be dug, and throw it at the farther End of the Empty Place; ſo that the height of the Trench may be fill'd, and that half a Foot higher than the adjacent Surface, taking care to place the <hi>Earth</hi> that lay on the Surface at the Bottom, to the end that the <hi>Earth</hi> which lay at the bottom, may in its turn become the Surface of the new Trench; this <hi>Earth</hi> ſo thrown, in the manner I mean, makes a natural Declivity, at the bottom of which all the Stones will fall by the ſame means, which muſt be remov'd immediately; and while the two Men thus throw the <hi>Earth</hi> which forms this Declivity, I would have the third, who ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining upon the edge of the Trench, to take the <hi>Dung</hi> with the Pitch-fork, and throw it without Intermiſſion, not into the bottom, but only upon the top of the Declivity in queſtion, and there ſpread it, that it may be ſo well diſpers'd, that no great quantity of it may lye together; by this means, ſuppoſing always the Work-men act briskly, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand each other, two very material things are done at once, and in a ſmall time, with little Charge; the firſt is, that the <hi>Dung</hi> is plac'd and mix'd in the <hi>Earth</hi> as it ſhould be, and the ſecond, that this <hi>Earth</hi> being ſtirr'd from top to bottom, grows eaſie and light, as it ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>I muſt not forget minding thoſe who dig along a Wall, to take care not to come too near the Foundations, for fear of indamaging it, the Wall might be in danger of falling; a ſmall ſlope of hard Ground muſt always be left untouched againſt it.</p>
                        <p>When beſides the Trench for <hi>Trees,</hi> there are to be others round about all the Squares or Ground Plots deſtin'd for <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> in a <hi>Garden</hi> not having the good Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are to be wiſh'd for, the ſame Method muſt of neceſſity be us'd, multiplying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the number of thoſe that are to <hi>Till,</hi> proportioning the number of thoſe that are to ſpread the <hi>Dung</hi> accordingly; there muſt always be the ſame depth of <hi>Earth,</hi> ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the firſt overture of the Trenches about a Fathom broad, it being for Example of the length of the whole Square, to which end the <hi>Earth</hi> that ſhall be taken out of the Trench, muſt be laid along the Square that is to be fill'd, which ſhall ſerve to fill up
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48210:54"/>
the Gage that ſhall lay empty at the end of the ſaid Square; in the mean time the Dung muſt be brought either in Baskets, hand-Barrows, or otherwiſe, into the Neighbourhood, or near that empty Place; and a ſufficient number of People ſhall be imployed to ſpread it upon the top of the ſlopes, by degrees, as the others continually throw new <hi>Earth</hi> towards the empty Places.</p>
                        <p>I warrant that with ſuch a concert of Workmen, well skill'd in their Work, the Ground may be diſpos'd to produce very fine, and very good <hi>Legumes,</hi> care being taken finally to make an univerſal <hi>Tillage</hi> to render all the Surface even.</p>
                        <p>I would only have People obſerve, that in caſe the <hi>Earth</hi> which wants to be amended or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, is naturally dry and ſandy, fat Dung muſt be imploy'd, for Example, Cow-dung, or elſe Horſe-dung, which ſhall have been rotten in a Moriſh Place; I ſeldom mention the Dung of Hogs, becauſe, that beſides its being ſcarce, it has an ill ſavour, which hinders People from deſiring it, it is capable of infecting the Ground, and giving it an ill taſte, which would infect the <hi>Fruit</hi> ſooner than better it: When they are courſe, ſtrong, moiſt <hi>Earths,</hi> the largeſt and dryeſt Dung will be moſt proper; for Example, Horſe and Mules Dung, never putting too much, nor too little, but a moderate quantity, exceſs being dangerous in theſe Caſes; on the other hand, putting none at all in the <hi>Earth</hi> in queſtion, is a defect that would ſoon be perceiv'd; as likewiſe putting but too ſmall a quantity, is a help, which not being ſufficient, muſt be look'd upon as uſeleſs, eſpecially in lean <hi>Earths,</hi> from which more is requir'd than it is able to produce; that is, abundance of thick well fed <hi>Legumes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The moſt reaſonable meaſure for imploying of that Dung, is to lay a Basket full, and that of a moderate ſize, upon the length of every Fathom of ſlope, when it is about the thickneſs of a foot of <hi>Earth;</hi> and thus the length of twenty Fathom to the breadth of ſix foot, and the depth of three, will conſume ſixſcore Baskets full, of that moderate ſize, that is, about ſuch a ſize as a Woman may partly be able to carry.</p>
                        <p>And when there is not Dung enough to make the mixture I have explain'd here, the ſmall quantity there may be of it muſt only be ſpread upon the Surface, ſpreading it with an even hand; after which <hi>Tilling</hi> it ſufficiently about nine or ten Inches in depth, it muſt be buried ſo that it may no longer appear on the out-ſide, and yet not ſo deep as to be out of the reach of the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Excrements of Sheep and Goats are very fit for that kind of Dung, and it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſpread about two Inches thick of it, that ſmall quantity will contribute to amend the <hi>Earth</hi> as much as a greater of Horſe or Cow-dung.</p>
                        <p>And in truth, I look upon Sheeps-dung, as the beſt of Dungs, and that which has moſt diſpoſition to fertilize all manner of <hi>Earths;</hi> the Treatiſe of the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> will ſhow more particularly how much I value it above all others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>La Poudrette,</hi> and the Dung of Pidgeons, and of Poultrey, may alſo make ſome amendments, but yet I ſeldom uſe them, the one is too ſtinking, and pretty ſcarce, the others are full of little Fleas, which ſticking to the <hi>Plants,</hi> are very prejudicial to them.</p>
                        <p>As for the Excrements of Aquatick Animals, or ſuch as commonly live in Water, it is ſtark nought, as well as that which comes from Cunny Warrens, witneſs the Sterility that appears about the Clappers; the rotten Leaves of Plants occaſion blackneſs and cold, which, far from amending, rots the new Plants, and therefore it muſt not be us'd at all.</p>
                        <p>The Leaves of <hi>Trees</hi> gather'd up, and rotten in ſome moiſt Ground, become rather a kind of <hi>Soil</hi> than Dung, and are fitter to be ſpread to ſecure the Earth from parching, than to fume the inſide of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Terreau</hi> or <hi>Soil</hi> is the laſt Service we receive from Dung, the Dung having ſerv'd to make Couches, conſumes it ſelf to that degree, that it becomes a kind of <hi>Mould,</hi> which then is no longer employ'd like Dung to fatten, but like <hi>Earth</hi> which produces ſmall <hi>Plants,</hi> and ſo ſeven or eight Inches of it is laid upon new Beds for <hi>Sallads, Raddiſhes</hi> and <hi>Legumes</hi> that are to be tranſplanted, or to remain, as <hi>Melons, Comcumbers,</hi> hard <hi>Lettuce, &amp;c.</hi> and about two Inches thick of it is likewiſe laid over <hi>Earths</hi> new ſown at the Spring, and in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when they are too dry of themſelves, or inclin'd to harden and ſplit eaſily by heat, the Seeds would dry up in the firſt, and could not penetrate the Surface of the other.</p>
                        <p>Therefore this <hi>Soil</hi> is us'd, which preſerving its Moiſture occaſion'd by <hi>Tillage,</hi> or Waterings, makes the Seeds riſe eaſily, and ſhoot with Succeſs; beſides, it has another property, which is, to hinder the Birds from picking off the new Seeds.</p>
                        <p>

Aſhes of all kinds would be of great uſe to amend the <hi>Earth,</hi> if there was enough of it; but whereas we have but little of it, it is only us'd about the Feet of ſome <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Trees,</hi> where they are not uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>Some People have a particular Value for <hi>Turf</hi> to make Amendments, but I look upon it in a different Manner, that is, as being fit to produce of it ſelf, and not to Fertilize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Earth;</hi> and I have a great Value yet for the <hi>Earth</hi> that lies under that <hi>Turf</hi> which we call new <hi>Earth,</hi> the which having never been wrought, is conſequently full of all the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility that can be expected from New <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore happy are thoſe who can make whole <hi>Gardens</hi> of ſuch:</p>
                        <p>But when People have not a ſufficient quantity to compaſs this, and yet have a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Stock of it, I would have them employ it either wholly for <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> or, at leaſt, in the ſame manner as I have caus'd Dungs to be Employ'd for deep <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                        <p>I Cannot approve the Sentiments of thoſe, who being Infected with the Vulgar Error in relation to Dungs, uſe it indifferently every where, even ſo far that to make a grand Maxim of it, they ſay in a pretty popular manner, that, eſpecially in relation to <hi>Trees,</hi> it is impoſſible to afford them too much Kindneſs, which is the ſoft and ſparkiſh Expreſſion they uſe in ſpeaking of what we vulgarly call Dung.</p>
                        <p>But, in order to examin whether their Opinion is any wiſe reaſonable, I deſire them to anſwer five Queries I propoſe upon that Subject.</p>

                           <item>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether, if thoſe <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> they mean all of them in General, to preſerve ſuch as are Vigorous and re-eſtabliſh thoſe that are Infirm?</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether they have a certain Rule for the quantity of Dung that is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to each, and for the place where it is to be laid?</item>
                           <item>And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether they ſhould be Dung'd in all manner of <hi>Earths,</hi> whether good or bad?</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I dare not believe that their Opinion in relation to Dungs, extends to all <hi>Trees</hi> in General, ſince every body knows that the <hi>Trees,</hi> of Foreſts, thoſe in the open Fields, and thoſe that ſerve for Avenues to Houſes, thrive commonly very well without ever having been Dung'd: In caſe thoſe Gentlemen allow this to be true, as to <hi>Trees</hi> that bear no <hi>Fruit,</hi> they condemn themſelves unawares as to <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> ſince both the one and the other receive their Nouriſhment in one and the ſame manner, that is, by their <hi>Roots;</hi> and indeed thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> working in a natural <hi>Ground,</hi> when it is paſſably good, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of finding enough of what is neceſſary for them to live.</p>
                        <p>But however, in all probability, thoſe Gentlemen only apply the Maxim in queſtion to <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> and yet really I cannot believe, that they dare own that they mean all thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> in General, ſince it would be ridiculous to ſay, that one and the ſame thing can be equally good; for ſo many <hi>Trees</hi> of ſuch different Conſtitutions, ſome more or leſs Vigorous, and others more or leſs Infirm; ſome Kernel, and ſome Stone <hi>Fruit, &amp;c.</hi> and yet they have never Explain'd themſelves upon that difficulty, and have never ſpoken upon this Matter but in general Terms; in which, as we have already ſaid, they make uſe of the Sparkiſh Term of Kindneſs, to perſwade the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I believe, that if they were preſſed to declare their Opinion, they would ſay, that they mean the moſt Vigorous, ſince great Vigour appearing inconſiſtent with the abundance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> it would be an ill Expedient, in order to get <hi>Fruit,</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a thing they ſhould believe proper to maintain that Vigour, and perhaps to augment it; moreover Dung being only look'd upon as a Remedy, and Remedies being only us'd for the Diſeas'd, it follows from thence, that that Dung is not to be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48210:55"/>
us'd for thoſe <hi>Trees,</hi> which, far from being any wiſe Infirm, have all the Signs imaginable of perfect Health, throughout their whole Extent, ſuppoſing then that Dung were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Improving <hi>Trees,</hi> ſtill I do verily believe, that it would ſooner harm theſe, than procure them the leaſt Advantage.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we may conclude, that their Opinion is, that Infirm <hi>Trees</hi> ſtand in need of the Aſſiſtance of Dungs: Now in order, if poſſible, to diſabuſe the World of ſuch an Error, I affirm ſincerely, that by a ſtudy'd Experience of a long Series of Years, I do know with certainty, that all the Dung in the World can operate nothing in Favour of any <hi>Tree</hi> whatever; I had liv'd long in that Common Error, my Curioſity having begun by that, as well as by the Rote of the Declinings of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but am now happily undeceiv'd, and all thoſe who will take the Pains to inform themſelves of the Truth thereof, without prejudice, will certainly conclude with me, that at beſt it is but a uſeleſs Labour and Expence; beſides, I declare that it is a great Happineſs when it does not prove prejudicial; thoſe Dungs, as I have hinted elſewhere, being apt to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender Worms which kill the <hi>Trees,</hi> and at moſt all the Vertue that is in them, extends no farther than to produce ſmall <hi>Roots,</hi> which <hi>Roots,</hi> though really good for ſmall <hi>Plants,</hi> can no wiſe contribute towards the forming of thoſe fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> by which we judge of the Vigour we deſire in <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But in order to enter a little farther into the convincing Proof of this Truth, which I eſtabliſh, I ſhould be glad to be inform'd exactly, what an Infirm <hi>Tree</hi> is, it is a matter I have enlarg'd upon ſufficiently in the Treatiſe of the Diſtempers of <hi>Trees, &amp;c.</hi> therefore I ſhall now only ſay, that, for Example, an infirm <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> is not always to be concluded ſo, by reaſon of its producing Yellow <hi>Shoots,</hi> ſince there are ſome that are very vigorous and yet produce Leaves of that Colour; they are only ſuch upon which ſome thick old <hi>Branches</hi> die, or ſuch of which the Extremity of the new <hi>Shoots</hi> wither, or ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce none at all, and remain ſcabby, full of Cankers and Moſs, and yet <hi>bloſſom</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; yet little of the <hi>Fruit</hi> knits, and that which does knit, remains ſmall, ſtony and bad: And when the <hi>Tree</hi> happens to produce large Yellow <hi>Shoots,</hi> which happens frequently, to ſome <hi>Pear-Trees Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince-Stocks,</hi> which being planted in a dry lean <hi>Ground</hi> are naturally in a good Caſe, this defect of Yellow Leaves proceeds from that, ſome of the principal <hi>Roots</hi> lying level with the Ground, are parch'd by the great Heats of the <hi>Summer.</hi> Now the Dung which is imploy'd for Amendments, and is conſequently put pretty deep into the <hi>Ground,</hi> can no wiſe prevent this.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if any of the <hi>Branches</hi> of that Infirm <hi>Tree</hi> chance to die, that Defect may proceed from that, either the <hi>Tree</hi> may be overburthen'd with <hi>Branches,</hi> compar'd to the ſmall Vigour of it, ſo as not to be able to Nouriſh them all, or elſe from its being planted too high or too low; or laſtly, from that the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is to Nouriſh it, is either bad or worn out, and eſpecially, when the Foot of the <hi>Tree</hi> has many dead <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the firſt Caſe, Dung cannot diſcharge that <hi>Tree</hi> from its Burthen: In the Second, it cannot make it to be better Planted: And in the Third, it cannot revive the dead <hi>Roots:</hi> And Laſtly, can produce no thick new ones; for Dungs have never been able to Effect that, neither great Dungs, though never ſo Rotten, nor the ſmall ones we call <hi>Soil.</hi> Thus as long as it produces no thick new <hi>Roots,</hi> we muſt expect no fine new <hi>Shoots;</hi> and while none of thoſe kind of new <hi>Shoots</hi> are produc'd, the <hi>Trees</hi> will always remain ill-favour'd, and the <hi>Fruit</hi> will never be well-condition'd in its kind, nor give us Satisfaction by the Abundance of it.</p>
                        <p>To this I add, that if Dung had the Faculty of rend'ring a weak Tree Vigorous; in the firſt place I ſhould have Experienc'd it at one time or another, after having try'd it ſo often; which being, I ſhould be much to blame to diſſent from an Opinion ſo well Eſtabliſh'd, and to endeavour at the ſame time to introduce a new Doctrine in the Room of it, which, inſtead of doing me any Kindneſs, would only ſerve to turn me into Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. In the Second place, if Dungs could afford Vigour, eſpecially to old Infirm <hi>Trees,</hi> that Advantage would certainly be attended by a very great Inconvenience, which is, that it would occaſion the Shooting of abundance of Falſe Wood or Suckers, and deſtroy the Diſpoſition of that <hi>Tree</hi> towards the producing of <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſince, contrary to the Maſters In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it would cauſe thoſe <hi>Buds</hi> which were grown round for <hi>Fruit</hi> to ſhoot out for Wood, which Wood muſt of neceſſity be remov'd as being Ill-condition'd and ill plac'd.</p>
                        <p>I explain more particularly in another Place, what is moſt proper to be done in ſuch a Caſe, and that is at the End of the Fifth Book, where I propoſe Remedies for the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of old <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48210:56"/>
But ſuppoſing it were good to Dung <hi>Trees,</hi> which I do not allow, what true Rule can be had for the more or leſs quantity of Dung each <hi>Tree</hi> may require: Will a moderate quantity produce the ſame Effect as a great one, or will not a great quantity perform more than a ſmall or moderate one? Moreover, in what place ſhall that Dung be plac'd, ſhall it be near the <hi>Stem</hi> or Foot, or at a diſtance from it? It will be uſeleſs near the <hi>Stem,</hi> ſince the Extremities of the <hi>Roots,</hi> where all the Action is perform'd, being diſtant from it, can receive no Benefit by it, and yet it is commonly laid particularly in that place, therefore thoſe Amendments ſhould be plac'd near thoſe Extremities, but how ſhall one be certain in what part they lay, eſpecially ſince thoſe Extremities ſtretching out Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conſequently Yearly change their place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I conclude by this Vulgar Obſervation, That Infirm <hi>Trees</hi> are met with in good <hi>Grounds,</hi> as well as in ill ones; will the ſame Remedy be proper for both? There appears to me a great deal of difficulty to anſwer thoſe three laſt Queſtions juſtly; ſo that thoſe certainly engage themſelves in a great Confuſion, who will have the only Remedy for <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> to conſiſt in Dunging, either to preſerve their Vigour, or to reſtore that which they have loſt. I find much more Advantage, and leſs Charge, in uſing new <hi>Earth,</hi> than any Dungs, whatever they be: I explain in another place the manner of Employing thoſe new <hi>Moulds,</hi> which has occaſion'd me to ſay in another place, that one of the chief Conditions, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the planting of young <hi>Trees,</hi> provided they be good, and the <hi>Roots</hi> well <hi>Prun'd,</hi> is to plant them in paſſable good <hi>Earth,</hi> and ſuch as has never been Dung'd.</p>

                           <hi>Quince-Trees</hi> do not thrive well in dry light Grounds, they grow yellow too eaſily; Almond and Stone <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> thrive better in this than in ſtrong <hi>Earth,</hi> in which they are too ſubject to Gumm; thoſe ſtrong <hi>Earths</hi> are fitter for <hi>Plums, Meriſiers,</hi> or ſmall bitter <hi>Cherrys, Gooſe-berries, Raſpberry Buſhes, &amp;c.

                        <p>But yet, as we ſhall declare in the Sequel, <hi>Earth</hi> has not the ſame Effect as to the good Taſte of <hi>Fruits,</hi> as it has as to the Vigor of <hi>Trees.

                     <p>AMONG the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are at preſent in uſe in the World, It may without prejudice be ſaid, There are ſome ſo Exquiſite and Perfect, that nothing is known more Delicious to the Taſt, and perhaps, hardly any Thing more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Health: And accordingly we are accuſtomed to make ſuch frequent uſe of them at all times, That we are almoſt perſwaded to Rank them among Things abſolutely neceſſary to Life; we hardly meet with any body that can be without them, ſo that there is nothing almoſt but People will do to have ſome; which is the Cauſe, That how Magnificent and Abundant ſoever any Great <hi>Feaſts</hi> may be, they are ſtill found Fault with, if Fair and Good <hi>Fruits</hi> be wanting to ſet out their Luſtre, and to help to leave behind them a certain Idea of Greatneſs in the Minds of the invited Gueſts; and thence it alſo comes to paſs, That the moſt ſumptuous and ſtately Country Manſion in the World, is thought to want one of its principal Ornaments, if it be not accompanied with Fair and well Planted and Contrived <hi>Fruit-Gardens.</hi> And therefore Nature, which does nothing in vain, has been careful to provide us almoſt an infinite Number of different ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and at the ſame time has inſpired us with a ſtrong Inclination, not only to Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thoſe of our own Climates, but alſo to multiply them, by adding to them, thoſe of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48210:57"/>
Foreign Countries, ſo that to ſpeak Truth; we ought to look upon the abundance ſhe has bleſt us with in this kind, as one of the greateſt Obligations we have to her; and it ſeems, as if all ſhe had done beſides, to make us Live and Subſiſt, would be thought very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, if we were deprived of the Treaſure the <hi>Gardens</hi> afford, a Treaſure that is to us a very great Aſſiſtance: For in effect, What is there more Precious or Commodious to Life, than to find good <hi>Fruit</hi> Planted in all inhabited Countries; and what is more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to us, than to have abundance of them at all ſeaſons of the Year?</p>
                     <p>And here a goodly Field offers it ſelf, were I minded to perſue it, in praiſe of thoſe Rich Preſents which the Earth furniſhes us of her own accord, even in the obſcureſt <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,</hi> and moſt horrid <hi>Deſarts:</hi> But that is a Task that belongs not at all to my Profeſſion, and much leſs is it any part of my preſent Deſign, and therefore as I am ſenſible how uncapable I am to undertake it with ſucceſs, I ſhall not venture upon it, but ſhall rather confine my ſelf within the modeſt pleaſure of Communicating to the World, what by long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I have found uſeful to Inſtruct Men to make the beſt Improvement of thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-pieces of Nature, and to aſſiſt them to add ſtill more and more Perfection to them by their Induſtry.</p>
                     <p>Now, though under the Name of <hi>Fruits,</hi> we ordinarily comprehend all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>Gardens</hi> that go under that Appellation, yet I pretend not here to Treat of any of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Leſſer Claſſis, ſuch as <hi>Strawberries, Raſpberries</hi> or <hi>Gooſeberries,</hi> nor of <hi>Muk-Melons</hi> neither, though they be certainly <hi>Fruits</hi> moſt Excellent in their kind; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Articles I reſerve to ſpeak of in our <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> of which they are to conſtitute a Part, but I ſhall only Treat here, of ſuch as grow on Trees, and which, when they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in their kind, and are planted in a proper Seat, and well qualified, make the True Ornaments of <hi>Gardens;</hi> for unleſs they be indeed of ſuch ſorts, there are many kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> that inſtead of doing Honour, do rather a Diſgrace, to the Maſter that Cultivates them.</p>
                     <p>And after I have diſcourſed of the good <hi>Fruits</hi> of all kinds of Trees, I ſhall alſo ſpeak of thoſe ſorts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which are ſo much Eſteemed by all Perſons of Quality.</p>
                     <p>I cannot proceed any further without taking Notice to you, how much I am ſurpriſed at the Contemplation of all the <hi>Fruit</hi> I ſee, as well in general, as particular: For as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinds, I am very much, having made very exact Deſcriptions of them, as well of their Inſide as Outſide, and that both of <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> and thoſe with <hi>Stones</hi> or <hi>Shells,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Figs</hi> and <hi>Grapes,</hi> as will be afterward ſeen; inſomuch, that of <hi>Pears</hi> only, I can affirm with Truth, that I have Seen, Taſted and Deſcribed above three hundred ſeveral ſorts, all different one from another, without finding all this while above thirty Kinds that were Excellent enough to my Taſte, to merit the Character of having regularly more good Qualities than bad ones.</p>
                     <p>I expect to find ſome curious Perſons, whom my Opinion in matter of Choice, will not pleaſe in all things: But let them permit me, if they pleaſe, to make a moſt humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which is, that before they cenſure the Eſteem, or Diſlike I expreſs for certain <hi>Fruits,</hi> they would firſt Examin very particularly my Intention, which chiefly tends to the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a continual Succeſſion of choice good <hi>Fruits;</hi> and after that, they would Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Peoples particular Palates are not to be diſputed; that being an inconteſtable Point, and in the next place, that great allowances are to be made to the fickleneſs of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of which we are not the Maſters, as alſo of the diverſity of Soils and Climates, which is almoſt infinite, and to the Nature of the Stock of the Tree, which is ſometimes Good, and ſometimes Bad; and laſtly to the Manner or Figure in which the ſeveral Trees grow and produce.</p>
                     <p>They are all points that require a great deal of Conſideration, and very much ſerve to Ballance the Opinions of thoſe that would judge of them. There are ſometimes ill Pears to be found among the <hi>Virgoulees,</hi> the <hi>Lechaſſerees,</hi> the <hi>Ambrets,</hi> and the <hi>Thorn Pears,</hi> &amp;c. And but Scurvy <hi>Peaches</hi> among the <hi>Minions,</hi> the <hi>Maudlins,</hi> the <hi>Violets,</hi> the <hi>Admirables,</hi> &amp;c. And in Fine, there are ſome bad <hi>Plumbs</hi> among the <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> ſome bad <hi>Grapes</hi> among the <hi>Muſcats,</hi> and ſome bad <hi>Figgs</hi> among thoſe that are moſt Eſteemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not that enough to aſtoniſh any Curious Perſon that has applied himſelf ſo much as I have done, to ſearch into their Nature, and ſhould I be excuſable if I were ſo diſingenuous as to ſuppreſs the great Obſervations and uſeful Reflections I have made thereupon, from which I have at laſt drawn this Concluſion; That although in a certain ſort of good <hi>Fruits,</hi> there may be ſome defective, yet it follows not from thence, that the whole kind ſhould therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, nor that on the other ſide, we ſhould put any great value upon another kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though known, by competent Judges in matter of <hi>Fruits,</hi> to be of a bad ſort, it may by ſome lucky hit; have yielded ſome tolerable good ones, which ſome leſs delicate Palates
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48210:58"/>
may be Enamoured with? For, in the firſt place, all the World is agreed, That of <hi>Fruits</hi> conſidered according to their Nature, there are three Claſſes, that is to ſay, there are ſome very good, and ſome very bad ones, and laſtly, That there are ſome again, that cannot well be comprehended under neither of thoſe, but can only be lookt upon as <hi>Fruits</hi> ſimply tolerable, and but indifferently qualified; And it is only thoſe of this laſt Rank, that finding here and there ſome Friends and Patrons, give occaſion to all Diſputes ariſing about the Choice of <hi>Fruits,</hi> for ſeldom it happens, but that all are unanimous in Praiſing the Firſt, and Rejecting the Second Sort, for we ſee that a good <hi>Ruſſet,</hi> or <hi>Virgoulee Pear</hi> is generally Eſteemed, and a <hi>Parmain Pear</hi> or <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> as much decried every where; But 'tis not ſo with a <hi>Doyenuee,</hi> or <hi>Dean Pear,</hi> or a St. <hi>Lezin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe granted, that, for Example, ſuch a <hi>Fruit</hi> may prove ill one year, or in ſuch certain Expoſitions or Placings, which may have appeared good ſeveral years before, or in other Expoſitions, and again on the other ſide, that ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Fruit</hi> may prove good this year, which was not to be endured ſome preceding years.</p>
                     <p>And, in Fine, it is alſo agreed on all hands, That in one ſort of Soli, Climate and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Tree, ſuch <hi>Fruit</hi> proves good, that always regularly proves bad in a different Climate, in another ſort of Ground, and another kind of Figured Tree. For Example, That which perhaps produces good <hi>Fruit</hi> in a full and open Air, will not produce nothing nigh ſo good in the Form of a Dwarf Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor every Plant that proſpers againſt a Wall, have the ſame Deſtiny in a full Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor every <hi>Fruit</hi> that proves good in a Sandy Soil, arrive to the ſame perfection in a moiſter Ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore I ſhall make as exact a Diſcuſſion of this matter as 'tis poſſible, that I may be the better able to come to a deciſion in the point of Choice, and of the order of Preference, which is the ſcope of my preſent diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, as it is probable, I have not yet attained the knowledge of all the ſeveral Sorts of good <hi>Fruit</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> and much leſs in the reſt of the Univerſe; there may perhaps be ſome which might thrive in our Country, and whoſe Excellence, were it once known to me, might induce me to make ſome alteration in the diſpoſition I am going to Eſtabliſh; I grant that ſuch a thing may be; but yet, I am perſwaded, there are no new ſorts produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſo I do not ſay; but that from time to time, ſome ſorts may be diſcovered, that after having remained a long time hid in the Obſcurity of certain remote Regions, may come at laſt to be known and admired by the great ones of the World; nay, we have ſeveral ſorts amongſt thoſe that are now reckoned moſt exquiſite among us, of which I dare affirm, that no mention was made in the firſt years of my Application to Curioſities of this nature.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I ſhall not fail to make the beſt Advantage of all ſuch Novelties as faſt as they ſhall come to our hands, and I heartily exhort all thoſe that ſhall ſee this Treatiſe, that they would teſtifie to the Publick the ſame Zeal which in this reſpect, I make profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of: For this at laſt is certain, that I would not venture to ſpeak my particular Thoughts concerning this matter of the choice and proportion of Fruits, but after a long Labour and Experience in their Cultivation; my deſign in ſo doing was at length to give ſuch advices as might be ſecurely followed, and with aſſured ſucceſs practiſed in a good part of this Kingdom, and in all Climats any thing like it, and 'tis in proſpect of this end, that I have entertained above theſe Thirty Years, a particular correſpondence with the moſt part of the Curious of our Age, as well at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in our Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> as in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, and the neighbouring Kingdoms; I have made it my ſtudy to procure every where as many Illuſtrious Friends in the Curioſities of <hi>Gardning</hi> as I could, that I might profit as much as was poſſible by their Light, and their rich Acquiſitions, while I endeavoured at the ſame time not to be unuſeful to them on my ſide; And as I can affirm without Vanity, that hitherto I have not ſucceeded amiſs, ſo the World may be aſſured, that I will never diſcontinue to Labour with all the Care imaginable, to draw into our own Soil, what Fruits are moſt conſiderable in other parts; which is as much as to ſay, in a Word, That I pretend not only to Satisfie and Regulate my own Curioſity in this matter, which is not ſmall, but alſo that of other honeſt and ingenious Lovers of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> which is no leſs eager than mine.</p>
                     <p>Now though it be not diſcommendable, to be always upon the Queſt of the Diſcovery of ſome new <hi>Fruits</hi> ſtill, that may deſerve our Care and Cultivation, which is what I am always doing without intermiſſion, yet it ſeems to me, that at preſent we are already in a Condition to be able to boaſt of a ſtore ſufficient to Form <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Orchards</hi> reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well furniſhed with Fruits for all Seaſons of the Year, ſo that I believe I may ſay there is no great neceſſity we ſhould be over ſolicitous in ſeeking out any more: About five and twenty, or thirty years ago, we could not have ſaid the ſame, it being an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth, that our Fathers were much leſs rich in theſe delicious Treaſures than we.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48210:58"/>
However, we cannot but ingeniouſly acknowledge, that the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> are not ſo happily provided for as the reſt, they wanting good Fruits that are tender and buttery; for thoſe ſorts of Pears that remain for the ſpending of thoſe Months, have not the Gift to pleaſe like thoſe that went before them, nor as moſt of them themſelves had formerly, they ſeeming every day to loſe more and more of their ancient Reputation; but till we have better to fill up their Places, we muſt be content to make the beſt of them we have; though, upon the whole matter, I think we ſhall not be over unhappy, if our <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretien-Pears</hi> which are laſt ripe, be provided with all the good Qualities they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; for without doubt there are ſome very good ones even in that Seaſon, and then thoſe Apples that are left, and which uſually laſt till the Month of <hi>June,</hi> ſatisfie well enough ſome curious Palats towards the end of Winter, and at the beginning of the Spring; but to ſay the Truth, they are not in any great number, nor thoſe of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Sorts.</p>
                     <p>For the better Eſtabliſhing therefore and authorizing my Judgment in ſuch Fruits as are known to us, I can aſſure you, and you may believe me, that I have not been only content with ſeeing, taſting and examining them my ſelf for ſeveral Years together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt partiality, but becauſe I would neglect nothing that might aſſiſt me to make a well-grounded determination in the matter, I have held frequent Aſſemblies of curious Perſons, and ſuch who were perfectly well skill'd in things of that nature, and that were perhaps Men of as delicate and exquiſite Palats as any in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>After ſo many Precautions and Experiences, I at laſt reſolv'd to undertake this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; <note place="margin">The Deſign of the Order of this Part.</note> and the better to ſucceed in it, and take occaſion to declare what is good or bad in each particular ſort of Fruit, with the different names under which they are diſguiſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Countries where they are found; for the number of thoſe Fruits that have but one Name, and particularly among Pears; as, for Example, the <hi>Boncretien,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſeleit,</hi> the <hi>Buttred Pear,</hi> the <hi>Meſſire John,</hi> the <hi>Portal, &amp;c.</hi> is but very ſlender; but as for other <hi>Pears, Plums, Peaches, Apples, &amp;c.</hi> it is quite another caſe with them, there being few of them without two or three, and ſometimes more Names.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I thought my ſelf obliged firſt, to endeavour to draw out the Picture and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of each Fruit, and to make it big enough, that it might be able to give the more lively Inſtruction for a thing which I judge neceſſary, which is to learn a Man to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh more eaſily, as well by the Eye as the Taſte, the only true Name which each reſpective Fruit ought to have: And that, without doubt, will be the ſame which will be found in uſe among the Able and Curious in theſe Matters at Court; the reſt of the World, as well in theſe as other things, being apt to follow exactly the Modes and Manners practiſed there.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch Determination of the Name of each Fruit, well Authorized by the Deſcription which I ſhall make of them, it will, I hope, come to paſs, that Gentlemen will no more fall into the Inconvenience of being peſterd with bad Fruits, under the names of good Ones, nor of having one ſort under different Names, and, conſeqnently of being ſo impoſed on as to be made to believe they have a great many ſorts, when they have but a few, conſidering the number of Trees in their Gardens. I ſhall place thoſe Deſcriptions in ſuch paſſages where I ſhall decide the choice of each Fruit in particular; and as I have elſewhere ſaid, they are intended only for thoſe that will take the pains to read them: As for others, that deſire only to be reſolved in ſhort, which are the good ſorts, and what proportion of each, they are to obſerve in their ſeveral Gardens; they will find at the end of this part, a little Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where they may preſently ſatisfie themſelves.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Place, I thought it would not be a little conducing to my purpoſe, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I am going to give my advice to a great many new curious Gentlemen, one after the other, who are all deſirous to be planting Fruit-Trees, but very much perplexed how to determine either what ſorts of Trees, or what numbers of each ſort they ſhall fix upon.</p>
                     <p>Whereof the firſt, perhaps, has not room for above one Plant, whether it be in form of a Dwarf-Tree or a Wall-Tree; a Second has place but for two, but another has room for a hundred Trees, and another for as many more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all of them are ſtudying what Choice to fix upon, and that with a great deal of eagerneſs too; for nothing is ſo hot upon the Deſign as are the Young <hi>Curioſo</hi>'s in Gard'ning, who always are big with longing to ſee their <hi>Gardens</hi> made up, and that quickly too, and yet none of them know where to begin, having yet received no directions from any body Skill'd in thoſe Affairs.</p>
                     <p>To eaſe them therefore of their Pain and Perplexity, I ſhall fancy my ſelf in the place of every one of them one after the other, that I may be the better able to Counſel each of them to do what I would actually do my ſelf, if I had that to do which any one of them would undertake; ſo that ſometimes you muſt ſuppoſe me ſome curious Gentleman that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48210:59"/>
would plant but a very ſmall Garden, ſometimes one that would cultivate but a middling one, and ſometimes another that would form a very great one: And I ſhall act all theſe ſeveral Perſonages, not only to be able to give my more effectual Aſſiſtance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming new Plantations, but in reforming old ones too, when ill contriv'd; ſo that, by this means, I pretend, that, after a few Years time, every one of thoſe Gentlemen that will take my Advice, ſhall infallibly find that pleaſure in his Gardens, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf to enjoy in them.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected, That it is not very ordinary to have Gardens ſo little to admit of the planting but of one Tree, or two of each ſort; but though that were true, as it is not, witneſs the little Gardens of ſo many Religious People in Convents, and of ſo many petty Burgeſſes in Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet would I demand the Liberty to ſuppoſe ſuch a Caſe, as a thing not only ſerviceable to my Deſign; but which appears to me more neceſſary than any thing, to make me be the better, and more advantageouſly underſtood by all the World.</p>
                     <p>And this being then ſuppoſed, I ſhall firſt advertiſe you, That among all ſorts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kernel or Stone-<hi>Fruits,</hi> there are ſome that I would willingly plant in a Garden of <note place="margin">Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> a certain bigneſs, which yet I have not eſteem enough for, to Plant in one of a ſmaller Extent, it being eaſie enough for a great one to receive any thing that is to be found in a little one, though the ſame Conſequence from great to leſs, does not appear to me ſo feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be drawn.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, there being different Manners and Forms of having <hi>Fruit Trees,</hi> I am to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you in the next place, That, for Example, as to <hi>Pears,</hi> there are ſome that I would ſeldom plant in any other Form than that of <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> as the <hi>Buttred Pears,</hi> or <hi>Beurrees</hi> and <hi>Virgoulees, &amp;c.</hi> and others again, which I more willingly raiſe in the Figure of high <hi>Trees,</hi> as are all the <hi>Fruits</hi> of an indifferent bigneſs, and more eſpecially ſuch as are apt to doughy and inſipid, ſuch as the <hi>Petit-oins,</hi> the <hi>Sucré-verts</hi> or <hi>Sugred-greens,</hi> the <hi>Thorn-pears,</hi> the <hi>Louiſe-bonnes</hi> or good <hi>Louiſas,</hi> the <hi>Lanſacs,</hi> &amp;c. And that there are ſome that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bear not well any where elſe but againſt Walls; as <hi>Boncretiens, Bergamots, Little Muſcats</hi> or <hi>Musk pears, &amp;c.</hi> and others again that will proſper well enough in what Figure or Place ſoever you plant them; as <hi>Ruſſelets, Robines, Leſchaſſeries, St. Germains, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, There being alſo <hi>Soils</hi> of ſeveral Natures, and <hi>Gardens</hi> of different Situations, I muſt likewiſe advertiſe you, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there are ſome <hi>Fruits</hi> which delight only in dry Grounds; as, <hi>Peaches, Muſcats</hi> or <hi>Musk pears, &amp;c.</hi> and others that proſper well enough in <hi>Soils</hi> that are a little moiſt, as <hi>Cherries, Plumbs, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there are Grounds that will not agree indifferently with all ſorts of Plants; as for Example, <hi>Peaches</hi> upon <hi>Plum-tree Stocks,</hi> and <hi>Pear-tree Graffs</hi> upon <hi>Quince Stocks,</hi> love rather fat than dry <hi>Soils;</hi> and on the contrary, <hi>Peach-graffes</hi> upon <hi>Almond-trees,</hi> and <hi>Pear-tree-graffs</hi> upon <hi>Frank</hi> or <hi>Good-Kernel-Stocks,</hi> proſpering both well in Sandy Grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there are ſome Fruits that do not ripen well, but when very well ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the Cold: as <hi>Muſcat</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> and particularly about <hi>Paris,</hi> and others that endure well enough the open Air, as all Red <hi>Fruits</hi> and moſt Kernel <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That moiſt Grounds are proper to produce large <hi>Fruit,</hi> but not to make them ſo delicate, without an extraordinary Care and Cultivation, whereas dry <hi>Soils</hi> are qualified to give them a delicious Taſte, yet they are apt to yield but ſmall <hi>Fruit,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be extraordinarily aſſiſted.</p>
                     <p>Now having deſigned to give my Advice upon all theſe Differences, that is to ſay, the Differences of Extent of <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Grounds,</hi> and the Differences of Expoſitions in them, the Differences of <hi>Soils</hi> and their Situations, the Differences of the ſeveral Forms of <hi>Trees,</hi> and of the Stocks on which they are Graffed; as alſo to give my particular Counſel and Directions about all ſorts of <hi>Fruits, viz. 1ſt.</hi> how to chuſe the beſt: <hi>2dly,</hi> How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe beſt, to cull out thoſe only that are moſt likely to proſper in that particular Form of a <hi>Tree,</hi> in which they muſt be planted: <hi>3dly,</hi> How to diſpoſe of each <hi>Tree</hi> in that part of the <hi>Garden,</hi> that is moſt neceſſary for it: And <hi>4thly</hi> and laſtly, How to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a juſt proportion between the Number of <hi>Trees</hi> of each ſort of <hi>Fruit;</hi> I ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this Method.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of Kernel <hi>Fruits,</hi> beginning firſt with <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> to ſhew firſt, which are thoſe that may ſucceed beſt upon <hi>Dwarf-trees; 2dly,</hi> Which may be moſt happily planted in Form of <hi>Standard Trees: 3dly,</hi> Which require to be placed againſt Walls: And <hi>4thly</hi> and laſtly, which are thoſe that give Satisfaction all manner of ways: After which, I will ſuccinctly deliver my Judgment as to <hi>Apples,</hi> remarking to you, which I eſteem moſt, and which leaſt, whether to be rear'd in the form of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> or of <hi>Standards,</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48210:59"/>
not thinking it worth any ones while, to give themſelves the Pains of Planting them in any other Faſhion, that is to ſay, of making <hi>Wall-Fruit</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>And when I have given Order how to fill up with <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Space of each Garden, I ſhall proceed afterward to the moſt curious part reckon'd in all Gardens, which is that of <hi>Wall-Fruit,</hi> and ſhall endeavour to ſhew in what manner I judge any Gentleman may moſt uſefully employ what walling he has, let its Extent in length or heighth be what it will, and what <hi>Fruits</hi> will beſt merit place there, and what are unworthy of that choice Station; under which Head, I ſhall treat not only of <hi>Plumbs</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> and ſhall tell what <hi>Fruits</hi> of all thoſe Sorts, delight in ſuch and ſuch certain Expoſitions, and can hardly endure any other; and which of them, in fine, are of a Temper good enough to agree indifferently with any of them.</p>
                     <p>When I ſhall go about to give Counſel about the choice and proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> there is one Article, in ſpeaking to which, I ſhall make great Difference between thoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gentlemen that aim at the pleaſing of their own Palats, only in Planting them, and ſuch as do it only with deſign to ſell their <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt whom I aim chiefly to gratifie in this Treatiſe, ought above all things, to ſeek for, as one may term it, the true intrinſick Merit of each ſort of <hi>Fruit,</hi> as diſcernible by their own Taſte, or by that of their Friends, for whoſe Entertainment they deſign them.</p>
                     <p>As for the other, they need to regard little elſe in them but the Beauty, the Largeneſs, and the ordinary Fruitfulneſs and Abundance of them, and to ſee they be of thoſe ancient Kinds that are moſt commonly Sold, and go off beſt; ſuch as the <hi>Orange-pear,</hi> the Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Pear,</hi> the dry <hi>Martin, &amp;c.</hi> which in thoſe Qualities carry it by many Degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>Leſchaſſerie,</hi> the <hi>Petit-oin,</hi> the <hi>Craſane, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as to their Cultivation, I make no great Diſtinction between one and the other <note place="margin">

                     <p>And ſince 'tis not enough to have rendred you an Account of the Method I think my ſelf obliged to obſerve in this Treatiſe, I think it further expedient clearly to explain to you what my Taſte and Judgment is, in all ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and firſt in <hi>Pears;</hi> that after I have declared what pleaſes or diſpleaſes me, as well in thoſe that are eaten Raw, as in thoſe which are not good without Baking or Preſerving: No Body may be ſurprized at the Praiſes I ſhall beſtow on the one, and the ſmall Account I make of ſome others; <note place="margin">Non aliter qui adverſo vix flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine lembum, remigiis ſubigit. <hi>Virg.

                     <p>Therefore I ſay, That as for raw <hi>Pears,</hi> I love them in the firſt place that have a kind of Butter-like and ſmooth Pulp, or at leaſt tender and delicate, with a ſweet ſugred and well reliſh'd Juice; and eſpecially when theſe Perfections are ſet off with ſomething of a Perfume; ſuch as are the <hi>Bergamot-pears,</hi> the <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Green-longs,</hi> the <hi>Beurrees</hi> or <hi>Butter-pears, Leſchaſſeries, Ambrets, Ruſſelets, Virgoulees, Marquiſes</hi> or <hi>Marchioneſſes,

Petit-oins, Winter Thorn pears</hi> or <hi>Eſpines de Hyver, St. Germains, Salviatis, Lanſacs, Craſanes,</hi> little <hi>Muſcats</hi> or <hi>Musk-pears, Cuiſſe-Madames,</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thighs, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, for want of the foregoing ſorts, I love thoſe that have a Pulp that breaks ſhort in the mouth, with a ſweet and ſurged Juice, and that ſometimes with a little ſmack of Perfume, ſuch as the <hi>Winter-Boncretien,</hi> gathered out of a good place, the <hi>Robine,</hi> the <hi>Caſſolet,</hi> the <hi>Summer Musk Boncretien,</hi> the dry <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſometimes even the <hi>Portal,</hi> the <hi>Meſſire-John,</hi> the <hi>Orange-green-pear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, I truly eſteem thoſe that are pretty much perfum'd and well ſcented; though I do not care this Perfection ſhould be incloſed in a Pulp that is extream hard, ſtony and full of dreggy Matter, as the <hi>Amadote,</hi> the <hi>Thick-tail</hi> or <hi>Groſſe-queuë,</hi> the <hi>Citron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> and the great <hi>Winter Musk pear, &amp;c.</hi> For that hardneſs and ſtonineſs do ſo much diſguſt me in all ſorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> that though I paſſionately love a little Smack of Perfume in any <hi>Fruit,</hi> yet thoſe two great Faults do in a great Meaſure ruine the eſteem I ſhould have otherwiſe, for thoſe kind of <hi>Musked-pears</hi> that I have laſt mentioned.</p>
                     <p>After having thus expreſſed what pleaſes me in raw <hi>Pears;</hi> it is no very hard matter to gueſs what may particularly diſpleaſe me in them; for that doubtleſs is, firſt, a Pulp, which, inſtead of being of a Butter-like, ſmooth and tender ſubſtance, or pleaſingly ſhort in the mouth, is doughy, as that of the <hi>Belliſſime,</hi> the <hi>Musked Beurree,</hi> the <hi>White Beurree</hi> or <hi>Gravel-pear,</hi> or that of the <hi>Musked Valley-pear,</hi> the moſt part of the <hi>Doynnees</hi> or <hi>Dean-pears,</hi> &amp;c. Or which is ſharp or ſour, as that of the ordinary <hi>Valley-pear, &amp;c.</hi> Or that is hard and tough, as that of the <hi>Bernardiere,</hi> of the <hi>Mountain Foundling, &amp;c.</hi> Or full of ſtony and dreggy Earthy Matter, as that of the <hi>Musked Pernan,</hi> of the <hi>Milet, &amp;c.</hi> Or that is of a wildiſh Taſte, as the <hi>Gilogile,</hi> the <hi>Dutch-pears</hi> or <hi>Foſſe-pears,</hi> and a numerous Train of others, of which I will make a particular Catalogue.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Pears</hi> to Stew or Bake, I prefer thoſe that are large, that Colour well in the doing, whoſe Pulp is ſweet and ſomewhat firm, and eſpecially ſuch as keep the longeſt in Winter, ſuch as are the <hi>Frank-reals,</hi> the <hi>Double-flowers,</hi> and the <hi>Donvilles:</hi> The <hi>Bonere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien</hi> particularly is admirably good prepared any of thoſe ways, only its preparation yields not ſo pleaſing a Colour; and in truth, when there is any <hi>Pear</hi> among them that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, either in Shape or Colour, it ought to be ſerved up only Baked, Stewed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Prepared; the <hi>Boncretien-pear,</hi> that has none of thoſe Defects, requiring and well deſerving to appear in its natural Beauty, that is, to be ſerved up raw.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the <hi>Amadote,</hi> the <hi>Beſidery,</hi> and above all, the <hi>Lanſac-pear</hi> for <hi>Autumn;</hi> and generally all the <hi>Winter-pears</hi> that are good raw, as the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> the <hi>Louiſſe-bonne</hi> or good <hi>Louiſa,</hi> the dry <hi>Martin,</hi> the <hi>St. Lezin, &amp;c.</hi> are admirable baked, or otherwiſe prepared by Fire, provided they be done before they be quite ripe, becauſe otherwiſe their conſiſtence will be too ſoft and doughy. The <hi>Winter Certeau,</hi> ſeems to me too ſmall to be kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and therefore it would be better to have ſome <hi>Standard Tree</hi> of it in the <hi>Apple-Orchards:</hi> The <hi>Gatelier</hi> reſolves it ſelf too ſoon into <hi>Marmalade;</hi> the <hi>Catillac,</hi> the <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabie,</hi> the <hi>Parmain-pear, &amp;c.</hi> are endued with ſuch a Tartneſs, that no Sugar can qualifie, and the <hi>Pound-pears</hi> and <hi>Love-pears</hi> are ſo near a-kin to them, that they may almoſt be reckoned in the ſame Rank.</p>
                     <p>To theſe firſt Obſervations I add, That, if in a very good <hi>Soil</hi> you are conſin'd within a Garden of very ſmall Extent, ſo that having room but for a very inconſiderable Number of <hi>Trees,</hi> you cannot have ſo much as one Stock of each, though Choice were made only of the prime Sorts, than in ſuch a Caſe, it were not amiſs, when the <hi>Trees</hi> would ſuffer the Experiment, to endeavour to have two excellent ſorts of <hi>Fruit,</hi> of two different Seaſons, upon every Stock; as for Example, a <hi>Boncretien</hi> with a <hi>Beurree</hi> or <hi>Buttred pear;</hi> a <hi>Leſchaſſerie</hi> with an <hi>Ambret;</hi> a <hi>Violet-peach</hi> with a <hi>Minion;</hi> a <hi>White Maudlin</hi> with an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, &amp;c.</hi> And there may be ſeveral Reaſons to juſtifie the graffing of ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Fruits upon the ſame <hi>Tree,</hi> provided the Stock be vigorous, and ſhoots forth promiſing Branches on both ſides; for otherwiſe the Enterprize would prove ſucceſleſs, becauſe 'tis to no purpoſe to graff upon that ſide of a <hi>Tree</hi> that is weak, with any hopes to have any <hi>Fruit</hi> there, either ſo good or for ſo long time, as may be expected from that ſide which is ſound and vigorous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I declare my ſelf a ſworn Enemy to all affected Multiplicity, and that I am not at all taken with the Pleaſure of ſome that paſs for curious Perſons, that believe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert publickly, That thoſe that pretend to have any thing like a <hi>Garden,</hi> ſhould have in it of every thing ſomething; there being ſome whoſe Palate is ſo far from being delicate, that they brag, for Example, they have two or three hundred Sorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> which they warrant all to be good, or, at leaſt, not bad. And they affirm, in a manner, as much of the goodneſs of <hi>Peaches, Plumbs, Apples, Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> of which they alſo boaſt to be ſtored with an incredible Variety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48210:60"/>
Such a great number of <hi>Fruits</hi> does but fright me, as certainly knowing, that what they ſay, cannot be true of all of them, in reſpect of Goodneſs; And, for my part, I cannot find in my Heart with the Curious of that ſort, to trouble my ſelf to get for one and the ſame Seaſon one good <hi>Pear</hi> and ſeveral others but indifferent; how fair ſoever the later may appear to the Eye: But I much rather chuſe to multiply thoſe Sorts which are infallibly good, that I may have, during any one Seaſon, a ſufficient ſtore of one ſort that is excellent, than to let my Fancy be led away after a compound diverſity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which may be perhaps agreeable to the Sight; but are aſſuredly diſguſtful to the Taſte; or, at beſt, qualified with a very indifferent degree of Goodneſs; or, to ſpeak plainer, with a little Goodneſs accompanied with ſeveral great Defects.</p>
                     <p>I know that nothing is more pleaſing in a Company that are Curious, and Paſſionate Admirers of good <hi>Fruits,</hi> than to be able to furniſh them with ſeveral Sorts at the ſame Time, when they are good enough to puſle the moſt Delicate Perſons among them, to judge which is moſt Excellent; as it may happen in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for <hi>Summer-Fruit;</hi> and of <hi>October, November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter:</hi> But in my Judgment, nothing is more unbecoming or beneath any Perſon of Quality that is Curious in ſuch Rarities, than to deſire to have an Abundance of all ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> without regard to any other Excellence, but what will meerly qualifie them to make a fine ſhow in the Variety from which reſults the ſo much praiſed Beauty of certain <hi>Pyramids;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What is to be thought of <hi>Fruit Pyramids,</hi> and how they are to be order'd. In this and the two next Paragraphs.</note> for alas! they are <hi>Fruits</hi> that will not endure the Teſt of any other Senſe but the Eye, which commonly are only uſed for <hi>Decorations</hi> to Tables, and are indeed now a-days in Faſhion, and which, 'tis true, have ſome appearance of Greatneſs and Magnificence, but yet after all, are good for nothing elſe but to do Honour to the skill of the Officer that piled them up with ſo much ſymmetry.</p>
                     <p>Upon which occaſion, I ſhall by the by tell you, That in the Houſes of Great Perſons, where ſuch ſorts of <hi>Pyramids</hi> are in uſe, and are by Cuſtom become in a manner neceſſary, particular care ſhould be taken to have ſpacious <hi>Gardens,</hi> that will afford room to plant <hi>Trees</hi> enough to furniſh wherewithal to compoſe ſo many as occaſion ſhall require, that may conſiſt all of ſuch ſorts of <hi>Fruits,</hi> as are both beautiful to the Eye, and excelling in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Which perhaps will not be over difficult to effect.</p>
                     <p>But for midling Gardens, we ought only to be Ambitious to have Magazines of <hi>Fruits</hi> that are really good and delicious, and not of ſuch as ſerve only for Ornament and Shew: And perhaps, if a ſufficient abundance of ſuch fair and good <hi>Fruits</hi> could be attained, I would be bold to maintain, that <hi>Pyramids</hi> compos'd only of them, as they would be really much more valuable than thoſe others, though beautified with leſs Variety of Colours, Shapes and Kinds of <hi>Fruits,</hi> ſo would they be better accepted, and more highly eſteem'd. At leaſt, without pretending to go about utterly to decry the Mode of uſing that other ſort of <hi>Pyramids,</hi> which plead a kind of Preſcription for appearing at great Tables, if they muſt be uſed, I would have them always accompanied with a pretty Basket well fill'd with the choice eating <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Seaſon, all fair and goodly, and all perfectly ripe; which in the Courts of Kings and Princes, is called the <hi>Hors-d'oeuvre,</hi> or the <hi>Out-work;</hi> and, as the Honour of a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> is to come off always whole and entire, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the leaſt breach or rufle, neither in its Conſtruction, nor in its Symmetry; ſo I pretend, that on the contrary, the Honour of the Basket conſiſts in returning always empty, without bringing back any thing its Errand was to preſent.</p>
                     <p>I will not here diſpute whether it be Expedient to Plant any <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in little Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, <note place="margin">Whether it be fit to Plant any <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in little Gardens.</note> becauſe no Body queſtions it, and eſpecially in thoſe of a large Extent, and that are ſpacious enough to contain all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> neither will I move any doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhould be any placed in very ſmall Gardens, becauſe that is a thing that depends of the Inclination of the Maſters of them, which are at their own Liberty to order them as they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing them to have already taken up a Reſolution to Plant ſome ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> in them, but are at ſome loſs, what ſort of <hi>Fruits</hi> they had beſt to fix upon for that purpoſe; I can very well diſcuſs this latter Queſtion, and give them my Opinion of what kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> it would be moſt for their purpoſe to make choice of for a <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> to Plant in ſuch a little Garden; as namely, whether a <hi>Pear-tree</hi> or an <hi>Apple tree,</hi> a <hi>Plum-tree</hi> or a <hi>Peach-tree,</hi> a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> or a <hi>Cherry-tree, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>In which Point my Deciſion ſhould preſently be, That all thoſe ſorts of <hi>Trees</hi> that bear not eaſily, or that produce not <hi>Fruit</hi> of ſufficient Goodneſs, ſhould be excluded out of all very little Gardens; and conſequently, that no <hi>Cherry-trees</hi> or <hi>Apple-trees</hi> upon Free-ſtocks ſhould enter into them; but as to the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> on the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> or <hi>Sweet-Apple-tree</hi> Stocks, the Caſe alters, becauſe they produce ſuch ſmall Tops, that one may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

admit a ſmall number of them into a little Garden, without incumbring it in the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peach-tree</hi> might well pretend a place there, for the Excellency of its good <hi>Fruit;</hi> but the Objections againſt it are, That in a few Years it grows too high, and ſpreads into a very ill-favour'd Top, and is too apt to ſhed its Flowers, to give any hopes of contenting its Owner. Beſides that, it is but too true, That excepting in ſome few City-Gardens, that are ſheltred from the <hi>North</hi> Wind by Lofty Buildings, or very high Walls. <hi>Peach-trees</hi> can hardly thrive any where in the form of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be let alone, only for the hot Countries, where they proſper wonderfully in the Vine-yards.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plum-trees</hi> of thoſe Sorts that we eſteem moſt, are alſo liable to the Inconvenience of growing too high, or of bearing very late, and very uncertainly; and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are to be excluded thoſe little Gardens of which we are treating.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> which beſides thoſe other Incommodities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires too much Attendance for the well covering it, for want of which it will be in great danger of periſhing.</p>
                     <p>In fine, among them all, our only Choice muſt fall upon the <hi>Pear-tree,</hi> for which I <note place="margin">The <hi>Pear-tree</hi> of all the moſt proper to be Planted in little Gardens, and why.</note> moſt incline; becauſe, if it be well ordered, its top or ſpreading cannot well grow monſtrous enough to be any Nuiſance; but, on the contrary, may be agreeable, and give pleaſure all the Year long, either by its Earlineſs, Plenty and conſiderable Goodneſs of its <hi>Fruit,</hi> or by its round, open and well ordered Figure, which laſts in all Seaſons. Next then, we are to ſee of what ſort that one <hi>Pear</hi> muſt be, that is to be planted in a Garden where the Maſter would have but one, or where there is no Room for any more; then of what Kind the ſecond muſt be, where there is Room for it; and thence we ſhall go on in order, to examin of what reſpective ſorts muſt be all the reſt, that are fitteſt to be Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every one of the other Gardens, of the ſeveral Bigneſſes to be propoſed, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the ſame time, which are to be Graffed on Free-ſtocks, and which on <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtocks.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall do nothing of all this, without firſt ſuppoſing every one of the Gardens I ſhall treat of to be encloſed with ſome ſort of Wall, and conſequently in a condition to receive ſome <hi>Wall-Fruit-trees,</hi> from which they may promiſe themſelves at leaſt with ſo much the greater certainty, the pleaſure of having ſome good <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumn Fruits;</hi> for I hardly reckon them for Gardens that have not the Advantage to be encloſed with Walls, although it were for nothing elſe but to ſecure them from the injurious Blaſts of the Cold Winds.</p>
                     <p>And ſuppoſing further, That here we are to treat of a little Garden, qualified with all the Conditions neceſſary, in regard of its <hi>Soil,</hi> and which we have above explained.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, ſuppoſing, That for little Gardens, the aim of a true and well guided Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, is rather to raiſe <hi>Fruit</hi> that may be fair and good, than purely to endeavour to have it early and haſtily, without any Conſideration of its Quality. For to Gentlemen, that are of this laſt Humour, I would not give Counſel to Plant any <hi>Tree</hi> of our beſt Kinds, but to them I would offer other Advices, which, being ſuch as I diſlike my ſelf, would by Conſequence not be over good to follow; and that would be, for Example, to Plant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Orange-green, White Butter, Doyennee</hi> or <hi>Beſidery Pear-trees,</hi> becauſe thoſe kind of Trees will aſſuredly yield Fruit much ſooner than the choicer Sorts; or, if they would have really good Fruit, but care not much whether they be of thoſe beautiful Sorts of Trees that content the Eye at all Seaſons, as well by the Regularity of their Diſpoſition, as the Beauty of their Shapes, then I would Counſel them, after they have choſen ſome <note place="margin">What the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor adviſes to Gentlemen over haſty for Fruit, with the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it.</note> of thoſe better Sorts, to Plant them indifferently, juſt as they come out of the Nurſeries, that is, with the moſt part of their Branches on, and yet with but few Roots, that being ordinarily a means ſure enough both to have Fruit quickly, and to have it good. But withal, it is as certain a way to have it but ſmall, to have but a little of it upon each <hi>Tree,</hi> and to have the <hi>Trees</hi> bear but a very little while, and to have them always grow in a ruſtick and miſerable Shape; to which, I add, That by ſuch an indiſcreet greedineſs, and over-haſty Method, they very often fall into the ſame Inconvenience with <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Dog, who loſt all by ſnatching after too much.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs Ingenuouſly, That I have a very particular Averſion for ill favoured <hi>Trees,</hi> and conſequently for all thoſe haſty Proceedings, that infallibly cauſe them to be ſuch. And eſpecially in a Garden that we would have agreeable for the goodneſs of its <hi>Trees,</hi> as well in <hi>Winter,</hi> when they are quite bare and ſtript, as in <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they are ſet out with their beſt Ornaments of Leaves and Fruits. For in ſuch a Garden, I ſhould not willingly conſent to plant none but ſuch <hi>Trees,</hi> as either yield Fruit ſoon

indeed, but good for nothing, or of thoſe others, that being firſt Planted in a wild ugly Figure, can never come to be fair or pleaſing to the Sight.</p>
                     <p>I very well know, That generally ſpeaking, the Intention of all Planters is not only to have Fruits, but to have ſome ſpeedily; and they have reaſon; for I am ſo far of their Mind, that I could wiſh, that in this reſpect the Order of Nature would accomodate it ſelf to our Deſires, ſo as to give us Fruit upon Trees that are Cut and Trimm'd, much ſooner than ſhe does, and particularly ſuch as are both fair and good: But alas! the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret never yet could be found, to make her in any conſiderable degree to advance her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pace, without ſpoiling all; and therefore, though the Skill of the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> may in that caſe be of extraordinary Aſſiſtance, yet, after all, our beſt way is to be content to allow that wiſe Mother the time ſhe takes of Four, Five or Six Years, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Kernel-fruits,</hi> which ſhe performs on ſome Trees ſooner, and on ſome latter; and to comfort our ſelves with the Conſideration of the Aſſurance we have, That, <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the Sequel ſhe will amply recompenſe us for the Scarcity of thoſe preceding Years; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That to give us <hi>Stone-fruit,</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Grapes,</hi> ſhe commonly requires leſs Time: For that, in effect, a Plantation of handſom and well ordered Trees of this latter Sort, ſeldom makes us ſtay above Three or Four Years without pleaſuring us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Quantity of Fruit, to while us with in Expectation of a full crop in the Fifth or Sixth Years, and many Years after.</p>
                     <p>But in Caſe the ordinary Time of ſtaying for <hi>Kernel-fruit</hi> ſeem too long, and the Party <note place="margin">What Method may be taken in ſpacious Gardens to have Fruit both ſoon and fair, while their principal Garden is growing to Perfection.</note> be a Perſon of Quality accommodated with great Gardens (for what I am going to Adviſe is not practicable in little ones) then I would willingly conſent, That in ſome by-place remote from the Principal Garden, he ſhould venture the Sacrificing of a good Number of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of the beſt Sorts of every Seaſon, Planting them whole and rough, as we have before hinted, and at ſmall diſtances one from the other, as in Nurſery-Gardens, that is to ſay, about Two or Three Feet one from the other: For, being ſo ordered and well look'd after, they will pretty ſoon yield ſome good Fruit, and tolerably fair too, which will be at the leaſt ſome beginning of Conſolation, till ſuch time as the fine Garden ſhall be arrived to Perfection enough to play its part. I followed this Expedient in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>Verſailes,</hi> as well for certain Fruits which in cold and moiſt <hi>Soils</hi> thrive not over well in the Form of <hi>Dwarf trees,</hi> as particularly for ſome new Kinds, whoſe new Names rendring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, fired my Curioſity with the greater Impatience to ſee the Fruits of them, in which I ſucceeded very well, as I did alſo in the joint Intention I had to arrive ſpeedily to ſome competent Abundance, and to raiſe by this means ſome Tall <hi>Standard-trees,</hi> both laſting and fair, of which I foreſaw I ſhould have need. However it is to be expected, that if ſuch Trees be kept too long in that manner, they will run great danger either of Dying, or at leaſt of infallibly becoming unfit to be removed to other Plantations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is for ſuch Curious Perſons as are very Rich and Able, and that Plant ſpacious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to conſult their own Inclinations upon the Point, and accordingly to reſolve whether they will pleaſe to be at a little the greater Expence, to attain by that means the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to taſte Fruit ſo much the ſooner, or otherwiſe to have the Patience to ſtay ſomewhat longer for a Crop, with aſſurance to have it with leſs Charge and much fairer, and in greater Abundance.</p>
                     <p>And though I have great reaſon to fear, the Preface of this Third Part, as Neceſſary as it is, may already have ſeem'd too long and tedious to new Beginners in theſe Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, who without doubt demand nothing more here but to know in all haſte which are thoſe choice Kinds of Trees they are to furniſh their Gardens with: Yet, by their leave, I muſt needs add Three Things more, before I can proceed to what will ſatisfie them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to eſtabliſh it for a certain Rule, That in all thoſe Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> where <note place="margin">The Effects of the Difference of <hi>Climates.</hi>
                        </note> the Cold and Heat are neither too long nor too violent, Nature having engaged her ſelf, as I may ſay, in ſome manner, to give us certain Kinds of Fruits in ſome particular Months of the Year, it therefore conſtantly happens of Courſe, that thoſe Kinds of Fruits do once in the Year without fail come to Maturity there: But withal, I muſt tell you, That it is no leſs certain that this happens ſooner in ſome Places, and latter in others, that difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening from the different meaſure of Heat that predominates in each place. Thus in the hotter Climates, the Fruits of each Seaſon ripen ſooner than in the colder; and what is more, ſome Fruits, and particularly ſome Sorts of <hi>Figs, Peaches</hi> and <hi>Grapes</hi> ripen ſooner in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than in the latter, which can never ripen at all in cold Regions. Which is the Reaſon why <hi>Italy, Provence, Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Guyenne,</hi> not only ſee thoſe Fruits ripen in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> which we on the hither ſide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> ſee not arrive to Maturity before the Months of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> but beſides have the peculiar Advantage to ſee ſome Sorts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48210:63"/>
of Fruits ripen with them, which for want of ſufficient heat, never turn to Account in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>North.</hi> But then again, as it is true, That in thoſe <hi>Southern</hi> Provinces, all their <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> Fruits are almoſt paſt, when ours hardly yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ripen; ſo to be even with them, we are often in the Prime and Height of our Crops, in the time when they have nothing at all left:</p>
                     <p>We ſee almoſt the ſame Difference happen in one and the ſame <hi>Climate,</hi> by reaſon of the Different Tempers of <hi>Soils</hi> and of Years, which, according as they are favoured with <note place="margin">As alſo of the Difference of <hi>Soils,</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Years in the ſame <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
                        </note> a greater or leſſer proportion of Heat, make the Fruits growing in them to be the more or leſs early. To give you an Example of this Effect in hot <hi>Soils,</hi> it is obſerved, That the <hi>Soil</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> has ordinarily the Start of above Fifteen Days before that of <hi>Verſailles;</hi> and for hot Years, that of 1688 was known to ripen us in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> thoſe Sorts of <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Muſcats,</hi> that in the Years 1686 and 1687 came not to Maturity till after the middle of <hi>September.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which ſuppoſes the ſame Difference as to the early or backward Maturity of all the other Fruits of each Fruit Month in the Year: Generally <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> are the Months that decide the Deſtiny of each ſort of Fruit for the time of their Maturity: And Curious Gentlemen that are Skilful, are to take their Meaſures well upon that Foot, ſo as not to let their <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter-</hi>Fruits hang too long on the Trees in hot Years, nor to let themſelves be ſurprized by the ripeneſs of them, which ought not fully to come to thoſe <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter-</hi>fruits not to hang too long on the <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </note> Fruits till ſome time after they are gathered and laid up. For 'tis certain there rots a great many of them after they are laid up, for want of being timely gathered; to prevent at leaſt ſome part of which Miſchief, I ſhall elſewhere preſcribe ſome Remedies.</p>

                           </gap> Year and <hi>Soil,</hi> and the Ripeneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits by.</note> ought, in my Opinion, ſerve for a great Rule in two principal Articles concerning Fruits; the <hi>Firſt</hi> is, To know what Fruits may ripen, or not ripen in every Garden in the Months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> for it is moſt certain that where-ever the <hi>Muſcat</hi> ripens, there all the Fruits of the latter Seaſon will ripen too, and reciprocally again on the other ſide, where-ever that ripens not, there the moſt part of thoſe other Fruits will not ripen nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Article or Point, for which the <hi>Muſcat</hi> may ſerve for a Rule, is, for the knowing whether thoſe Fruits of the latter Seaſon ſhall comparatively ripen ſoon or late; for it is a moſt certain Mark, That in what Gardens ſoever, where the <hi>Muſcats</hi> ripen ſoon, that is to ſay, about the End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the Beginning of <hi>September,</hi> there the Year is forward; and, on the other ſide, if they Ripen late, that is, towards the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> it is as ſure a ſign, that the Year is backward: So that, in Truth, I have found I might as ſecurely govern my ſelf by this Rule, as any Mariner by his Compaſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Thing I have to add, is, That we are to reckon Four diſtinct Seaſons of <note place="margin">Four ſeveral Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Fruits, and how reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Fruits; namely, <hi>1ſt,</hi> The <hi>Summer</hi> Seaſon, which begins in <hi>June,</hi> and finiſhes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September. 2dly,</hi> The <hi>Vacation</hi> Seaſon, or firſt <hi>Autumn,</hi> all which comprehends the firſt part of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and ends at <hi>Martelmas,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November.</hi> The <hi>3d,</hi> which begins where the laſt ends, and holds till about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> comprehending the latter part of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and may be called the ſecond <hi>Autumnal</hi> Seaſon. And the <hi>4th.</hi> and and laſt is that of <hi>Winter,</hi> which beginning in <hi>January,</hi> holds on till the appearance of the Red Fruits of the Month of <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, after having done with firſt and ſecond Things I had to propoſe, as I promiſed in the Project of this Part, I am in the third place to ſpecifie to you, which are the principal Kinds of Fruit, not only of every of thoſe Seaſons, but of each particular Month of which they are compoſed: So that our Deſcription will be like a little Landskip in which may be ſeen, with one caſt of an Eye, the whole Abridgment of all that can give Pleaſure in Matter of Gardening; and by that means, without any further Diſcuſſion, we may be able perhaps of our own Heads, to determine what Choice to make of thoſe Kinds which we fancy beſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I ſhall run through all the Months in Particular, the more preciſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to you what Fruits each of them claims to its ſhare, without omitting to mention ſo much as thoſe, that becauſe they grow not on Trees, ſuch as are <hi>Strawberries, Raſpberries, Gooſeberries, Currans, Musk Melons, Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. are not within the compaſs of our preſent Project. But I ſhall ſpeak of them not in the Order commonly uſed in the World, but according to that of the ſucceſſive Maturity of their Fruits.</p>
                     <p>And accordingly, <hi>Summer</hi> ſhall be the firſt part of the Year with which I ſhall begin; <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Summer-</hi>Seaſon.</note> it being moſt true, That the <hi>Summer</hi> Seaſon is the firſt that can be ſaid any thing richly to entertain us with the new Productions of the <hi>Earth:</hi> And I dare affirm, That, in matter of Fruits, we may look upon that Seaſon as a kind of annual and fleeting Republick,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48210:63"/>
which from very ſmall beginnings at firſt, riſes in a very little time to a very conſiderable power, which yet is not of long continuance, becauſe no ſooner is it eſtabliſh'd in its full Glory, but it begins to flag, and tend towards that Decay which ſoon after it ſinks into; though indeed it be not ſuch a Decay that brings with it an entire Deſtruction, but only like a kind of <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> or Vacancy of Government, which is a Revolution it muſt ſuffer for ſome Months, which being paſt over, its Deſtiny will make it reaſſume its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flouriſhing Eſtate, and the ſame Viciſſitudes in which we have before ſeen it, and through which, as I have ſaid above, it paſſes conſtantly once every Year.</p>
                     <p>In diſcourſing of which, you are above all Things to take notice, That it will be <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>June.</hi>
                        </note> chiefly with reſpect to our own Climate, that I ſhall enter upon the particularities and upon the Diſcuſſion of the ſeveral Sorts of Fruits each Seaſon. Accordingly to begin with the Fruits of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> I ſay, and few People there are but know, that <hi>Straw-berries</hi> that begin to Ripen at the End of <hi>May,</hi> begin to be in great Plenty at the Entrance of <hi>June;</hi> and I add, that they are followed hard at the heels by the forward <hi>Cherries</hi> raiſed upon <hi>Wall trees</hi> well plac'd, and that before the End of the ſame Month, <hi>Currans Gooſeberries, Raſpberries, Guignes</hi> and <hi>Haſting-Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Griots</hi> too begin to fill the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; and, in fine, that the bedded <hi>Muskmelons,</hi> the forward <hi>Apricocks,</hi> and ſome little <hi>Muſcat-pears</hi> upon <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> endeavour to ſhew us by ſome little Samplers, the Riches which they altogether promiſe us in greater Abundance in the Month next immediately enſuring.</p>
                     <p>That is to ſay, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> commonly, and not without Reaſon, called the <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>July.</hi>
                        </note> month of Red Fruits; For accordingly, till the Fifteenth or Twentieth Day of it, there continues to be a great Plenty of all the Kinds of that Fruit which were beginning to come in during the preceding Month; and when they draw to an end, the backward <hi>Cherries</hi> or <hi>Bigarros</hi> fail not to ſucceed them, and to perform their Duty; during which Opportunity, the Induſtry of Diſcreet and Skilfull Perſons that have the Care of them, by the help of Sugar which is at their Command, makes a moſt admirable uſe of all ſorts of Red Fruit under different Figures.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall not forget to tell you, That <hi>Muskmelons</hi> are, without Contradiction, <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                        </note> the Principal of all the Fruits of the Seaſon; and that beſides, provided that in well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified <hi>Soils,</hi> ſome <hi>Wall Fig-trees</hi> be intermixed between the Boxes of the former, we may ſee thoſe <hi>Muskmelons</hi> accompanied with a great Abundance of <hi>Figs;</hi> at the ſame time may be expected Plenty of forward <hi>Peaches,</hi> of Yellow <hi>Plums,</hi> of little <hi>Muſcat</hi> and ordinary <hi>Apricocks,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Tall-trees</hi> or <hi>Standards</hi> ſhall ſtrive with a ſeeming Emulation which ſhall preſent us with the greateſt Numbers of <hi>Pears,</hi> called <hi>Cuiſſe-Madams</hi> or <hi>Lady-thighs,</hi> of <hi>Maudlin-Pears,</hi> of the three Sorts of <hi>Blanquets,</hi> of <hi>haſty Ruſſelets,</hi> of <hi>Bourdons, Muskat-Roberts, Skinleſs pears,</hi> and of many others of leſſer Quality; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that we have a great deal of Reaſon to be very well ſatisfied with this Month of <hi>July.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we are once in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we are arrived, as I may ſay, to the great Magazin of an infinite number of good Fruits. For in the beginning of this Month there continues ſtill as great a Plenty as can be deſired, both of <hi>Figs</hi> and backward <hi>Cherries,</hi> of <hi>Bigarros</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> as well on <hi>Wall-trees</hi> as on <hi>Standards;</hi> and by way of Surpluſage ſtill to ſo many Bleſſings, the unbedded <hi>Muskmelons</hi> begin to furniſh our Tables, and to bear Company with the bedded ones which laſt to the End of the Month. Beſides all which, towards the End of the ſame Month, we begin to have <hi>Pears</hi> of the following Sorts, <hi>viz. Robines,</hi> Summer musked <hi>Boncretiens, Caſſoletts, Eſpragnes</hi> or <hi>Reſerve-pears, Fondants de Breſt,</hi> or melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>Breſt, Ruſſeletts,</hi> &amp;c. And above all, this is the illuſtrious and happy Month for the Fruits that charm me moſt, that is to ſay, for certain <hi>Plums,</hi> which when in our Climates they have the good Fortune to be raiſed upon <hi>Wall trees,</hi> may diſpute the Prize of Excellence with moſt Fruits of the Seaſon, or at leaſt may claim an equal place in our Eſteem with the moſt Famed and Accompliſhed of them all. Thoſe <hi>Plums</hi> are the two Sorts of <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> white and violet; the <hi>Prune Royal,</hi> the Cloath of Gold <hi>Plum,</hi> the <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock Plum,</hi> the St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> the <hi>Diapred Violate,</hi> the <hi>Rouche Courbon,</hi> the <hi>Queen Claude,</hi> &amp;c. together with thoſe that thrive well enough upon <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> that is to ſay, not only the moſt part of thoſe already named, but likewiſe all thoſe that bear the Title of Damask, and are of Five or Six Faſhions very different one from another, either in Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Colour, Figure, or more or leſs early Maturity; there being of them the White, Black, Red, Violet, Grey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall tell you by the by, That the grey Damask appears to me to be one of the principal Sorts; beſides which the <hi>Mangerous,</hi> the <hi>Mirabelles</hi> and the <hi>Imperials, &amp;c.</hi> ſtrive at this time which ſhall do beſt, and imitate the <hi>Wall-trees</hi> which now yield the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48210:64"/>
reſt of their Crop of <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches</hi> of <hi>Troy, Roſſanne, Alberge</hi> and <hi>Cherry Peaches, &amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>Wall-trees</hi> begin alſo to give us ſome <hi>Maudlin, Mignon</hi> and <hi>Bourdin Peaches,</hi> which are ſometimes accompanied with the <hi>Muſcat,</hi> and forward or haſty <hi>Grapes,</hi> as well black as white; and therefore none can diſpute but that this Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> is furniſhed with wherewithal to ſatisfie the moſt inſatiable, nice and difficult Curioſity 'tis poſſible to have.</p>
                     <p>But yet how Rich ſoever the foregoing Month has appear'd, I may for all that without ſcruple ſay, That this of <hi>September</hi> is nothing inferior to it; for what almoſt does it not <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                        </note> produce in our Climates? It is the true Month for good <hi>Peaches,</hi> there being every where ſuch an extream Abundance of them, that they are ſerved up in no leſſer Quantities than by great Pyramids at every Meal. The white and red <hi>Maudlins,</hi> and the <hi>Minions</hi> which began only to come in Seaſon in the precedent Month, are ſo far from being exhauſted now, that 'tis particularly at this time they are in greateſt plenty, and are followed by a great number of other Sorts of <hi>Peaches,</hi> all very Excellent, and every one Ripening regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, according to the Order of Maturity that Nature has eſtabliſh'd among them, and that, without doubt, with a particular intent they ſhould be able to furniſh with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ſucceſſive ſtore, all the parts of the whole Month; and this is their Order, the <hi>Bourdins</hi> begin, the <hi>Cherreuſes</hi> or <hi>Goat-peaches</hi> follow next after them, and immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the haſty <hi>Violets;</hi> then come the <hi>Perſicks,</hi> and then the <hi>Bellegardes</hi> and white <hi>Andilli's,</hi> and laſtly the <hi>Admirables,</hi> the <hi>Brugnons</hi> or <hi>Nectarines,</hi> and the purple <hi>Peaches;</hi> a Number great enough one would think to content us ſo, as not to leave us any Stomack to deſire any more in this Seaſon; and yet that is not all, for this Month of <hi>September</hi> yields us beſides abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Grapes,</hi> of <hi>Chaſſelas,</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> of three Colours, of <hi>Ciotats,</hi> of <hi>Morocco Grapes,</hi> and ſeveral other Sorts of good <hi>Grapes,</hi> and particularly a great Plenty of <hi>Muscats,</hi> which of what Colour ſoever they be, whether white, or red, or black, (provided they have all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies that belong to them, that is to ſay, the firmneſs, perfumed Scent and ſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In a a word, it ſeems, as if the Deluge or full Tide of good Fruits happened in this Month, which in effect, if it produced much leſs than it does, would ſtill be extream Rich, and luxuriantly Plentiful.</p>
                     <p>The Month of <hi>October</hi> indeed poſſeſſes not ſo great a number of Stone-fruits as its <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                        </note> Predeceſſor, but yet for all that, it is not ill furniſhed with them; for all the admirable and purple <hi>Peaches,</hi> nor the <hi>Figs</hi> neither were not conſumed in <hi>September,</hi> there often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a ſufficient Quantity of them in this Month: Beſides which, its Fertility extends much further, as being in a Condition to make us great Largeſſes of <hi>Nivette-peaches,</hi> yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low late, and violet late <hi>Peaches,</hi> and yellow <hi>Lices,</hi> or ſmooth <hi>Peaches,</hi> all Excellent <hi>Peaches</hi> for the latter Seaſon; and even in our Climate, the great red <hi>Pavie</hi> or baſtard <hi>Peaches</hi> of <hi>Catillac</hi> and of <hi>Rambouille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Reign of thoſe Fruits which acquire not their Excellence till after they are Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, fails not to begin at the ſame time when that of Fruits that attain their full <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi>
                        </note> Ripeneſs on the <hi>Trees,</hi> expire; that is to ſay, particularly the Reign of Stone-fruits, whoſe Deſtiny ordinarily terminates about the end of <hi>October.</hi> But this is our Comfort,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48210:64"/>
That we ſhall not yet this pretty while perceive any ſenſible diminution of Fruits, there remaining for a part of <hi>November</hi> many of thoſe that we ſaw ſignalize themſelves towards the end of the foregoing Month; beſides which, good <hi>Grapes</hi> will alſo laſt a good while, if care has been taken to gather them before the Froſts, and to keep them carefully in the Fruit-lofts: For, being ſo ordered, they have as great a Privilege as any to appear at Noble Tables, though they be a little ſhriveled; it being not to be denied, but that they are always very good ſo long as they continue untainted with any ſpeck of Rottenneſs. The long <hi>Muſcat Grape</hi> is that whereof I moſt particularly ſpeak here, it having the Gift to pleaſe the greateſt King in the World: And I that have the Honour to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and chief Manager of his <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> what ought I not to do, and indeed what do I leave unattempted for the finding out all means imaginable to furniſh him with that darling Fruit for ſeveral Months together?</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the <hi>Chaſſelas-Grapes</hi> both white and black, want not Patrons that highly praiſe them; for they have the advantage both to ripen and to keep much more eaſily than the <hi>Muſcats.</hi> And becauſe, in Truth, they can hardly have the confidence to appear at the ſame Table with the <hi>Muſcats,</hi> they wait till they are paſſed to triumph in their turn; and ſo theſe two Sorts of <hi>Grapes</hi> both do honour to the Month of <hi>November,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Muſcats</hi> in the beginning, and the <hi>Chaſſelats</hi> at the end; theſe latter laſting the moſt part of the <hi>Advent-</hi>Seaſon. I add, That this Month is ſtill Opulent and well ſtored with Miraculous <hi>Pears.</hi> For the Fruit-loft, if well ſtock'd, ſupplies it with a good part of thoſe that were ſo much in Fame at the end of <hi>October,</hi> it being accommodated with conſiderable remains of <hi>Bergamots, Craſannes, Marquiſes</hi> or <hi>Marchioneſſes, Lanſacs, Petit-oins, &amp;c.</hi> And beſides, this Month is the Maſter and Diſpenſer of very many other good <hi>Pears;</hi> for there are ſome that begin to mellow in its time, and that is in Favour of thoſe whoſe Gardens are in a hot and dry <hi>Soil,</hi> or that, have <hi>Wall-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> the ſame <hi>Pears</hi> otherwiſe ſtaying longer to contribute to the good Fortune of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> for their Commodity whoſe Gardens are in a little more fattiſh and coldiſh <hi>Soil:</hi> And theſe kinds of <hi>Pears</hi> are, the <hi>Eſpine</hi> or <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>Leſchaſſerees, Ambrets, St. Germains, Paſtourells, St. Auguſtins, Virgoulees, &amp;c.</hi> And for thoſe Perſons too that love <hi>Pears</hi> that break ſhort in the Mouth, and ſuch as are musk'd, this Month of <hi>November</hi> preſents them with <hi>Spaniſh Boncretiens, Amadots,</hi> dry <hi>Martins,</hi> Winter <hi>Ruſſelets,</hi> which are all tolerably good <hi>Pears,</hi> though not ſo Excellent as thoſe which are tender, or, as 'twere, Buttered.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall tell you in another place what ſorts of <hi>Pears</hi> grow ſtark naught when they are too long a Ripening, and of what Kinds, the biggeſt <hi>Pears</hi> are commonly the worſt: And on the contrary again, of what other Sorts, the little ones are regularly and ordinarily good for nothing.</p>
                     <p>Nay, and the very <hi>Apples</hi> come to do Homage to this Month of <hi>November,</hi> and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly to diſplay the Proofs of their Merit: The <hi>Red Calvils</hi> ſignalize themſelves above all the reſt; and as they pretend to reign alone in this Month, they leave to their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the <hi>Apis,</hi> the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Grey Pepins,</hi> the <hi>Courpendus,</hi> the <hi>Fenouillets</hi> or <hi>Fennel-apples,</hi> the <hi>White Calvils, &amp;c.</hi> They leave to theſe, I ſay, the Field free for the Months of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, January, February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſeems not neceſſary to ſpecific any thing more particularly of the Fruits of <hi>December,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe being a Month confining upon <hi>November</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> and coming between both, it is in poſſeſſion of an ample ſhare of the greateſt part of the Riches of both Months; and conſequently it may truly be ſaid, That its condition is none of the worſt, eſpecially in Years that are a little backward; nay, and as I have already told you elſewhere, we have very often reaſon to complain, that the principal Fruits of the Seaſon mellow too faſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this Month; it making a very great many of them grow ſoft and rotten, as if in effect their Deſtiny would not permit them to paſs any further.</p>
                     <p>The Order of Nature will not permit that which in few Months time, mounted to <note place="margin">Fruits in <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi>

                        </hi> and <hi>St. Auguſtin-pears,</hi> which probably may not have begun to appear before; and together with them, there are to be had ſome <hi>Musked-pears,</hi> and ſuch as break ſhort in the mouth, as namely, the great <hi>Winter Musk pears,</hi> the <hi>Lemon-pears, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, there are no <hi>Pears</hi> ſo mean, though to the degree of a <hi>Portal,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Pear</hi> much renowned in <hi>Poiton,</hi> but think themſelves good enough to contribute ſomething to the Riches of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary:</hi> And indeed one cannot but allow, That all theſe ſorts of <hi>Pears</hi> have ſomething wherewithal to render the Month of <hi>January</hi> none of the leaſt eſteemable; becauſe we are now fain to accommodate our ſelves the beſt we can with what we have, without ſtanding too much upon Niceties, ſince we know the happy time of Choice and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to be really paſt with the laſt Months of the late expired Year.</p>
                     <p>One may in ſome ſort ſay, That in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> and ſtill more in the Month <note place="margin">Fruits of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, March</hi> and <hi>April.</hi>
                        </note> of <hi>March,</hi> the low Ebb of the Empire of Fruits begins in Earneſt, it being now fallen into a terrible abject State; for beſides dry and liquid Sweet-meats, and <hi>Lemons,</hi> and <hi>Apples,</hi> and what we call baking or ſtewing <hi>Pears,</hi> namely, the <hi>Double flowers, Donvills</hi> and <hi>Angoberts, &amp;c.</hi> which both in this Month and all along after, till the coming of <hi>May-Strawberries,</hi> make up almoſt all the Furniture of the Deſarts, what have we elſe left but ſome St. <hi>Lezins,</hi> which are but little worth, and ſome <hi>Bugy-pears,</hi> which yet are not ſo much to be ſlighted, ſince the <hi>Lent-</hi>Seaſon makes up with them a part of its beſt days? But particularly there ſtill is left us a certain kind of thoſe Famous <hi>Pears</hi> that bear the venerable Name of <hi>Boncretiens,</hi> which, as it cannot but be unanimouſly confeſſed, are capable alone gloriouſly and happily to terminate the Campaign</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not fail in another place to lay before you what muſt needs produce in you a great Conſideration for them, but at preſent I ſhall only content my ſelf with telling you, That, if I may be permitted ſo to ſpeak, we are to look upon them to be, as 'twere, the Rear-guard and Body of Reſerve of the Army of Fruits newly disbanded; for, in effect, that great number of other Fruits having for the ſpace of Eight or Nine Months, fought againſt and exterminated that Sterility that would have oppreſſed us without their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and being at laſt diſmiſſed, the <hi>Boncretien</hi> remains alone, being, as it ſeems, the General, who with a ſmall number of Subaltern Officers, gently retires to take up his Winter Quarters in Expectation of new Recruits for another Expedition.</p>
                     <p>But I am afraid 'tis not enough to have told you what ſorts of Fruits are to be had in every Month, there remaining, methinks, one thing ſtill very neceſſary to be treated of, and that is to ſhew you with ſome tolerable Exactneſs, how long the Fruit of any Tree whatſoever will ordinarily hold out in ſpending, ſuppoſing the Trees reaſonably well loaded; becauſe, unleſs that be known, it will be hardly poſſible to regulate what number of Trees one may, within a ſmall matter over or under, need, to furniſh one with a handſom proviſion of them, without troubling ones ſelf to Plant a ſuperfluity of Trees,</p>
                     <p>Upon which, I tell you, that we may ſay ſuch a Tree is well loaded, if, for Example, one <hi>Wall Peach-tree</hi> yield Fifty great <hi>Peaches,</hi> and one <hi>Dwarf Pear-tree</hi> bear Fifty large <hi>Pears;</hi> and if of <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> of a midling bigneſs, each <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> or <hi>Standard</hi> bear about the quantity of Two hundred a piece; and of <hi>Figs</hi> in Boxes, one Box yields two or three Dozen, and if of the ſame, one <hi>Wall</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-</hi>Stock yeilds about a Hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It being certain that as in the firſt Years of their bearing, all theſe Sorts of Trees yield much leſs, ſo when they grow to their juſt bigneſs, and the Years prove good, they bear ordinarily much more Fruit than the proportion I have ſpecified.</p>
                     <p>This then being Eſtabliſh'd for a Rule, I ſhall next obſerve to you, That Experience further teaches us theſe Three Things; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Regularly the Fruits of the good <hi>Wall-trees</hi> of every Garden ripen a little before thoſe of <hi>Standards;</hi> and theſe again ſomething before thoſe that grow on <note place="margin">Precedence of Maturity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</note> 
                        <hi>Dwarf-trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>Second</hi> is, That among <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> thoſe facing the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South-</hi>quarters are the firſt that bring their Fruit to Maturity, which theſe two firſt do commonly much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time, they both being earlier than thoſe of the <hi>Weſt</hi> by Eight or Ten Days, and than thoſe of the <hi>North,</hi> by at leaſt Fifteen or Twenty; though, in ſerious Truth, thoſe Fruits of the <hi>North</hi> are little to be counted upon, unleſs it be ſuch as ſome <hi>Butter-pears, Craſannes,</hi> and ſome kinds of baking or ſtewing <hi>Pears, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48210:65"/>
III. In fine, The third Thing that Experience teaches us in matter of Fruits, is, That <note place="margin">The ordinary laſting of the Fruits of every ſort of Tree. And <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-</hi>Fruits. Secondly, of thoſe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn;</hi> and,</note> as to thoſe <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits that are to be gathered as faſt as they ripen; a <hi>Peach-tree,</hi> a <hi>Plum-tree,</hi> a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> a <hi>Pear-tree, &amp;c.</hi> yield Fruit for Ten or Twelve Days, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never paſs that time: and as for thoſe <hi>Pears</hi> which uſe to be laid up in the Fruit-lofts, of which the firſt are thoſe that are eaten in the Beginning of <hi>Autumn;</hi> as namely, the <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> the <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long green-pears,</hi> the <hi>Bergamots, &amp;c.</hi> each of thoſe Kinds laſt about Fifteen or Twenty Days at moſt, the different Figures of thoſe Trees, and the different <hi>Soils,</hi> and different Expoſitions in which they are Planted, lengthening or ſhortning a little Duration of their Fruit.</p>
                     <p>As for the Fruits that are for the ſpending both during the End of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and all the <note place="margin">Thirdly, of the Fruits of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seaſon, and of Winter.</note> whole <hi>Winter,</hi> which though, what Kinds of Trees ſoever they be gathered from, are commonly laid up promiſcuouſly together, People only contenting themſelves with laying each Kind of Fruit in ſeparate Heaps by themſelves; yet Perſons that are very Curious, ſuch as I am, are ſo accurate as to ſeparate even the Fruits of one and the ſame Kind into different heaps, laying the Fruit of one Tree of them in one place, and that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another, according to the differences of the Figures of their Trees, and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Expoſitions, that they may the more preciſely know when each of them mellows. Now, I ſay, of theſe Kinds that are for the ſpending, as well of the End of <hi>Autumn,</hi> as of the whole <hi>Winter;</hi> there are ſome that furniſh you for a Months ſpending, ſuch for the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> are the <hi>Pears</hi> called the <hi>Craſanne,</hi> the <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> the <hi>Meſſire-John,</hi> the <hi>Green ſugar,</hi> the <hi>Vine pear,</hi> the <hi>Lanſac,</hi> the <hi>Flowered Muſcat, &amp;c.</hi> And others that afford a ſupply for five or ſix Weeks, ſuch as are for the End of <hi>October</hi> and part of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>Louiſe-bonnes</hi> or good <hi>Louiſes,</hi> the <hi>Petit-oins,</hi> the <hi>Thorn pears,</hi> the dry <hi>Martins, &amp;c.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again there are that ſupply us for near Two Months, as the <hi>Virgoulees,</hi> the <hi>Ambrets,</hi> the <hi>Leſchaſſeries,</hi> the <hi>Paſtourelles,</hi> the <hi>St. Auguſtins, St. Germains,</hi> and above all the <hi>Thorn-Pears</hi> may laſt part of <hi>November</hi> and all <hi>December.</hi> Laſtly, Some endure till <hi>January,</hi> as the <hi>Colmars</hi> and the <hi>Boncretiens,</hi> that may laſt all <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> and likewiſe the <hi>St. Lezins</hi> and <hi>Bugis</hi> that are able to ſupply us both in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From hence we may conclude, That, for Example, if a curious Gentleman have in <hi>Summer</hi> time a competent Number of fine Trees of each Kind, and for <hi>Peaches, Plums, Figs, &amp;c.</hi> have ſome <hi>Wall-trees</hi> in all the ſeveral Expoſitions; and for <hi>Pears, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. have ſome others, in both the ſeveral Forms of <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> and <hi>Standards,</hi> provided the Trees be of a full Age to bear, ſuch a Perſon may reckon that about Twenty Days he ſhall be reaſonably well ſupplied with Fruits of each Kind. For, for Example, if he have three fine <hi>Wall-Minion-Peach-trees,</hi> ſuch as they ought to be after three, four or five Years Planting at furtheſt, one towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> another toward the <hi>South,</hi> and a third towards the <hi>Weſt;</hi> theſe three fine <hi>Peach-trees</hi> may ſupply him with that kind of Fruit for three Weeks together, and yield him in that time about a hundred and Fifty fair <hi>Peaches,</hi> that is to ſay, ſeven or eight a day; and conſequently he may have Three hundred, which is at the rate of Fifteen or Sixteen a Day, from ſix <hi>Peach-trees;</hi> which is no over great Number of Trees of the ſame Kind; and he may have no leſs than Six hundred from Twelve Trees, which is at the rate of about Thirty a Day; and that is a very Noble Proviſion; the ſame may be ſaid as to the <hi>Mandlin, Chevreuſe, Admirable, Violet</hi> and <hi>Nivete-peaches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And if from ſo moderate a ſupputation, we may expect ſuch a conſiderable Treaſure of <hi>Peaches,</hi> with much greater Reaſon, what may we not look for from double, treble or quadruple the Number of Trees of thoſe ſame Kinds of good Fruits? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, two <hi>Ruſſelet</hi> or two <hi>Robine pear-trees,</hi> whether they be <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Standards,</hi> when they are come to the Age of four, five or ſix Years, and have been always carefully trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cultivated, may be able both together, to furniſh us for at leaſt Fifteen Days, and in that time to give us Two or Three hundred <hi>Pears;</hi> that is to ſay, about Twenty a Day, and conſequently four <hi>Ruſſelets</hi> or four <hi>Robine-trees,</hi> will yield us Five or Six hundred of each ſort, being about Forty a Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe two and four <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of what Seaſon ſoever they be, will yield us of each Kind in particular, a like Proviſion, which is always to be underſtood of thoſe ſorts of Fruits that are not very big.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Thing alſo holds in the great Fruits of the beginning of <hi>Autumn.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as to <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> two great <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of that Figure will in Fifteen Days time, furniſh us near One hundred fine <hi>Pears,</hi> and Four will give us near Two hundred, that is to ſay, about Fourteen or Fifteen a Day: And for <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> two and four <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots</hi> of that Figure will produce no leſs: In like manner for the Fruits of the latter Seaſon, Two and Four <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of <hi>Craſſannes, Marchioneſſes, Thorn-pears, Virgoules, St. Germains, St. Auguſtins, Ambrets, Leſchaſſeries,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo Two and Four <hi>Wall-Boncretien-pears</hi> will
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48210:66"/>
yeild the ſame quantity in proportion. And as for <hi>Standards</hi> and high Trees, Two or Four <hi>Pear-trees</hi> of thoſe choice Kinds which have the good Fortune to thrive in that Place, will yield at leaſt double that quantity; that is to ſay, Two or Four hundred goodly <hi>Pears:</hi> According to the ſame Rule of proportion, Six and Eight will produce Six hundred, Eight hundred, and ſo forward <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which I have ſaid in the eaſe of <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> may ſtill with greater Reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to that of <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> which excepting the <hi>Red Calvil-trees,</hi> are ordinarily more Fruitful than the <hi>Pear-trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay nothing of the Red Fruits whoſe Product is meaſured either by the pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight, or by Baskets heap-full, becauſe there is no Body but knows how to gueſs well enough at them: All the World likewiſe knows what is the uſual Increaſe of a Bed of <hi>Strawberries,</hi> a Tuft of <hi>Raſpberry-buſhes,</hi> and of <hi>Curran</hi> or <hi>Gooſeberry-ſhrubs,</hi> or of a forward <hi>Wall Cherry-tree,</hi> or of a Standard <hi>Cherry-Agriot</hi> or <hi>Bigaro-tree.</hi> It is alſo well enough known, That one <hi>Musk-melon</hi> plant furniſhes ordinarily but Two or Three <hi>Melons,</hi> but that a one <hi>Cowcumber-</hi>plant produces of that Fruit ſucceſſively Two dozen or more.</p>
                     <p>Our Curious new Planters then having made upon this Foot, a pretty ſupputation of the Product of each ſort of Fruit, may eaſily Judge how many Stocks or Plants they ſhall need to Plant of every of them, without blindly engaging themſelves in the Trouble and Charge of two great a multitude.</p>
                     <p>I know, the greateſt part of thoſe that out of an exceſſive eagerneſs to have Fruit, undertake to Plant Gardens, are, as it ſeems, like moſt new Travellers who ordinarily Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling for no other Deſign but barely to content their own Curioſity, will not omit ſeeing even the leaſt ſingularities of each Country, though perhaps there are a great many not worth their pains; and though have they been advertiſed of it before-hand by Men able and experienced that know the Country, and give them that caution to ſpare them ſuch Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Labour; yet they will not hear them, it being enough to animate their paſſionate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing them, that they have been told the contrary by ſome other Perſon, though much leſs knowing in the Matters in Queſtion than the others.</p>
                     <p>And ſo in our Buſineſs of Gardening, how many <hi>Apprentices</hi> or, if you pleaſe, <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> (would I might be permitted to make uſe of that term) I ſay, how many <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> or <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is eaſie to find a colourable Excuſe for the Exceſſive curioſity of Travellers, for that when they are once upon the Way to ſee Things, they may at little Charge, and in little time, inform themſelves generally of all Things, ſo that no perſon whatſoever ſhall be able afterwards to impoſe upon them, or thwart them concerning Things not ſeen: But in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fruits, the itching Deſire to have all ſorts of them, is a Diſeaſe ſo much the harder to cure, becauſe inſtead of being look'd upon as ſuch, it ſeems on the contrary to have all the inciting Charms of a ſingular Perfection: And in earneſt, thoſe poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen greatly move my pity, becauſe they will never be at quiet, till they have ſpent a great deal of Time and Money, only to know at laſt by a long Experience attended with a great deal of Vexation, That there are ten times more kinds of Fruits fit only to be flighted, than there are good and deſerving enough to be cultivated, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have been forewarned of it by ſome underſtanding Friend, but have not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Counſel.</p>
                     <p>How happy had I been, if during thoſe many years that I was ſerving my Apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in this Art, under the Conduct only of my own Head, I had met with an able Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to Guide me? For, above all Things, I ſhould moſt have needed one to cure me of a kind of mad Fancy one has commonly for that which they call <hi>New Fruits,</hi> though very often they prove nothing elſe but ſome common ſorts diſguiſed under new Names; which is an unhappineſs cauſed partly by the ignorance of ſome People, and partly by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of ſome fantaſtical preſumptuous Pretenders; who, out of a vain deſire to be thought richer in ſuch Curioſities than they are, endeavour by this Artifice, to ſtir up people to Court them for ſome ſhare of them.</p>
                     <p>And now, for my part, it ſhall be none of my fault, if all perſons that are curious in Gardening, avoid not all the ſhelves by which I have paſſed, and take not at the very firſt ſetting out, the ſhorteſt and beſt way that can be taken in this Matter; which is aſſuredly of a vaſt Extent, and the number of Perſons that have loſt their way there, is infinite.</p>
                     <p>But, in fine, after having ſet down all the Precautions and Obſervations above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, I ſhall now enter upon the large and particular Account of the Choice and Proportion of Fruits, which I engaged my ſelf to give you, not without telling you
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48210:66"/>
by the way, That I found it a Work at leaſt as Difficult and Perplexing in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as I firſt thought it would be, and perhaps more than I could imagine.</p>

                           <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> if, as I may ſo call it, the Antiquity of its known Extraction may be <note place="margin">Reaſons for the Preference of the <hi>Winter Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretien.</hi>
                              </note> counted for any advantage to it in this Cauſe, as it is in ſo many other more important Matters, then without doubt our <hi>Boncretien</hi> or good <hi>Chriſtian pear</hi> may in that particular pretend it ſelf much more Noble than all the other <hi>Pears.</hi> For though probably all <note place="margin">Its Antiquity.</note> Fruits were created in one and the ſame Day, yet 'tis certain they were not all known at the ſame Time, but ſome ſooner and others later: And this <hi>Pear</hi> was one of the firſt that by its ſingular Excellencies, gain'd the Admiration and Courtſhip of the World: The great Monarchies, and principally that of Old <hi>Rome</hi> having known and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated it under the Name of <hi>Cruſtumium</hi> or <hi>Volemum;</hi> ſo that in all appearance it often <note place="margin">Its old Roman Name, <hi>Volemum</hi> or <hi>Cruſtumium.</hi>
                              </note> made a noble Figure among thoſe Conquering People, in the magnificent Entertainments they uſually made, as well to ſet out the Splendor of their Triumphs, as to do Honour to the Tributary Kings which often came to pay their Homage to thoſe Maſters of the World.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond place, the Great and Illuſtrious Name which it has ever born ever ſince <note place="margin">Its Modern Name.</note> ſo many Ages, and with which it ſeems to have been baptized at the very Birth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf; how can it but imprint in all a Veneration for it, and eſpecially in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Gardeners?</p>
                           <p>In the third Place, To conſider it in its ſelf, that is to ſay, with reſpect only to its own proper Merit, which is that which is particularly in Queſtion, and can only intitle it to a preference in this place; it muſt be confeſſed, That among Kernel-Fruits, Nature preſents us nothing ſo Beautiful, nor ſo Noble to behold as this <hi>Pear,</hi> whether we conſider <note place="margin">The Deſcription and Praiſes of this <hi>Pear.</hi>
                              </note> its ſhape which is long and pyramidical, or its bigneſs, which is prodigious, as being for Example three or four Inches thick, and five or ſix long, and very commonly of a pound weight or more, nay, and ſometimes exceeding two pounds, which is certainly a truth of rare and ſingular Remark: Or particularly, if we caſt our Eyes upon its lively Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Colour, with which the ground of its natural Yellow is ſo charmingly ſet off, when it grows in a favourable Sun and advantageous Expoſition, that it attracts the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the whole World: Add to this, That it is the <hi>Pear</hi> which of all others gives the longeſt pleaſure, as well upon the Tree, upon which it continues ſtill increaſing to the view of the Eye from <hi>May</hi> till the End of <hi>October,</hi> as in the Fruit-Magazine; where eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerving its ſelf for four or five Months together, it daily pleaſures the ſight of the Curious that have a mind to look upon it, as much as the view of a Jewel or a Treaſure rejoyces the Maſter that poſſeſſes it. It is the <hi>Pear</hi> that does the greateſt Honour at all Tables, and which in all Countries, and principally in <hi>France,</hi> where the Gardens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a wonderful quantity of them has acquired the greateſt Reputation: It is that which is moſt commonly made uſe of when any conſiderable Preſents of Fruits are made, and eſpecially ſuch as are ſent to remote places, either within or without the Kingdom; and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48210:67"/>
laſtly, it is the <hi>Pear</hi> for the Beauty of which, the ableſt Gard'ners have always Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greateſt Paſſion, and that which yields the greateſt profit to thoſe which Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate it only to expoſe to Sale. It is always very good ſtewed or baked, when People have a mind to eat of it a little before 'tis full ripe, and it cannot be denied but it is moſt Excellent when we give it time to mellow, if it come out of a Garden where the <hi>Soil</hi> is naturally good, or, at leaſt, well Cultivated; and it has this Advantage over and above, That its mellowneſs is not like that of the moſt part of the <hi>Butter-fruits,</hi> which paſſes, as one may ſay, like Lightning; ſo that thoſe Sorts of Fruits are no ſooner mellow, but they grow ſoft and pappy, and degenerate into Rottenneſs; whereas the mellowneſs of each <hi>Boncretien-pear</hi> continues to maintain it ſelf in Vigour for ſome whole Months together, as if ſeemed with Patience to wait the time when we ſhall be pleaſed to do it the Honour to Employ it to thoſe Uſes for which Nature deſign'd it.</p>
                           <p>'Tis true indeed, That in the Order I have eſtabliſhed for the Excellence of <hi>Pears,</hi> the firſt degree of Goodneſs is altogether wanting to this, becauſe it is not Buttery; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it may ſeem, that becauſe here our Buſineſs is to give the firſt Rank to that ſort of <hi>Pears</hi> only, that can vaunt it ſelf to have the moſt Excellent Taſte, I ſhould not grant it to this which, by my own Confeſſion, is but in the ſecond Claſs of good Ones.</p>
                           <p>But though it has not the firſt degree of Goodneſs, it is certain, it wants not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; that is to ſay, a Pulp that eats ſhort, and is often tender enough, with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Taſte, and a ſweet ſugred Juice, indifferently abundant, and a little perfum'd; from the Conſideration of which, without doubt, it was that our Fathers, to make a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between that and other <hi>Pears,</hi> added to its Name the Epithet of <hi>Good,</hi> without doing the ſame Thing in Favour of any other <hi>Pear;</hi> which additional Name has remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it every where in all Countries, but only in <hi>Poitou,</hi> where the People content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with calling it only the <hi>Chriſtian-pear.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And, beſides all the Advantages above-mentioned, it has likewiſe this, which appears to me a very great one, that is, when all other <hi>Pears</hi> are paſt, this ſtill remains to Honour our Tables till the new Fruits of the Spring; and, by conſequence, protracts even ſo far as that time, the pleaſure of thoſe that love raw Fruit. All which ſumm'd up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, excites in me ſo much Conſideration for the <hi>Good Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Boncretien-pear,</hi> that I think I ſhould do a kind of Injuſtice if I ſhould refuſe it the Place of a Firſt <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I know very well it pleaſes not all the World, and that it is ſlighted by certain People, that accuſe it to have commonly a Pulp or Fleſh, that is tough and ſtrong, or, at leaſt, not very fine.</p>
                           <p>To which I anſwer, That thoſe are general Accuſations, and ſuch as may in a manner be made againſt all ſorts of Fruits; it being but too true, that we are not to expect to find any that are abſolutely perfect, and therefore accordingly we call only thoſe good Fruits which have the feweſt Defects. I will not deny but that among <hi>Boncretien pears,</hi> there may be ſome that may deſerve the Reproach caſt on them by thoſe Perſons; but, in my Opinion, they deſerve it not always by their own Fault, ſince it is true there very often are found moſt excellent Ones among them; and therefore thoſe Defects, when found in theſe <hi>Pears,</hi> are rather to be attributed to the badneſs of the <hi>Soil</hi> in which they grew, as not being proper for the producing of good Fruits, or of their Expoſition, as being Planted in a Quarter not bleſſed with a favourable Aſpect from the Sun; or to the Negligence or Unskilfulneſs of the Gard'ner, who took not ſufficient care of them, or to the over haſtineſs of thoſe that needs will be ſerving them up before they are come to a fit Maturity.</p>
                           <p>I know very well too, There are a great many Perſons that think a <hi>Boncretien</hi> can never prove good upon a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> and that 'tis abſolutely impoſſible to have any fine ones unleſs it be upon <hi>Wall-trees;</hi> and therefore, that they will highly condemn me for chuſing it for the firſt to be Planted in a Scituation which they pretend directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. But though I do ingenuouſly grant it true, That the <hi>Boncretien</hi> ſucceeds beſt upon a <hi>Wall-tree,</hi> eſpecially in acquiring that Vermilion that ſo well becomes it, and which the full Air on a <hi>Standard-tree</hi> cannot give it in ſuch Perfection, yet I believe I have hitherto pretty well ſucceeded in diſabuſing a great number of Curious Perſons of the falſe Impreſſion they had againſt a <hi>Boncretien</hi> upon a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> by ſhewing them by the certain Experience of ſeveral Years, eſpecially in Gardens of a midling Extent, well cloſed and ſheltred from the great Colds, either by good Walls of their own, or by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Buildings, and which conſequently are in a good Expoſition, and advantaged beſides with a <hi>Soil</hi> indifferently good, either by Nature or by the help of Art; that upon Trees
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48210:67"/>
of that Figure may be raiſed very goodly <hi>Boncretien pears;</hi> that is to ſay, very great ones well ſhaped with a good fine Skin, a little bluſhed on that ſide next the Sun, and in the reſt of their Bodies, of a green proper to take a yellow as they grow ripe; and, in a Word, very Excellent <hi>Pears,</hi> and ſuch as few <hi>Wall trees</hi> were ſeen able to compare with.</p>
                           <p>And, to put an End to this Conteſtation, I think it not neceſſary to make here any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwers, than, in the firſt place, to invite our Adverſaries to go in <hi>Autumn</hi> and ſee the <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in ſeveral Gardens at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at <hi>Vernon,</hi> where they rear ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ine ones; and, in the ſecond place, to ask them whether before the uſe of <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> which is not Ancient, there were no where in the open Air any fair <hi>Boncretiens?</hi> if they ſay not, all the Back-Courts of the Provinces of <hi>Tourain, Angoumois, Poitou, Auche,</hi> &amp;c. where they grow even upon <hi>Standard-trees,</hi> will evidence the contrary againſt any that ſhall deny it: To which add, That the invincible Perſecution of the <hi>Tyger-babbs,</hi> keeps the <hi>Pears</hi> too far <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Tyger-babbs,</hi> a pernicious Inſect infeſting <hi>Wall-pears.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>In fine, when the whole Matter is well examined, I am perſwaded, That whoſoever ſhall count on one ſide the Enemies of the <hi>Boncretien</hi> upon a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> and the Reaſons they think they have to condemn it for, and the other ſhall reckon up its Approvers, with the Experiences they have on their ſide, will find the Number of theſe lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The Differences of <hi>Soils</hi> and Expoſitions, of dry and wet <hi>Summers,</hi> and of Vigour and Weakneſs in a Tree, whether it be in the whole Tree, or only in a part of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe Differences, I ſay, cauſe theſe other little External Differences of Colour, Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Wall-tree</hi> will produce Fruit more golden than green, and the <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> more green than golden; and the Dwarf graffed upon a Free-ſtock will produce greener Fruit than that which is graffed upon a <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtock.</p>
                           <p>If the Tree be ſick, whether it be young or old, it will bring Fruit without a Core, and upon that very ſame Tree, if there be any vigorous Branch, as it often enough happens, there will be a Core in the Fruit that grows upon that vigorous ſide, though there be none in the <hi>Pears</hi> that grow upon the infirm Branches; and if from that yellowiſh and languiſhing ſide, a Branch be taken and graffed happily upon a ſound and lively Stock, it will produce a Tree both green and brisk, which will ſhew not only the Conformity of its kind with that of other <hi>Boncretiens;</hi> but likewiſe its good Health, as well by the Core as the the green Colour of its <hi>Pear:</hi> Upon which occaſion I ſhall tell you, That ſuch <hi>Boncretien-pears</hi> as grow yellow upon the Tree, and have a Skin that feels extraordinarily ſoft, are apt to have but a very indifferent goodneſs.</p>
                           <p>A good Fruit-Branch will produce a <hi>Pear</hi> long and large, and a Fruit-Branch of a little more inferiour Goodneſs, will form its Fruit ſhort, flat and roundiſh: A good <hi>Soil</hi> gives it a fine Skin, and a delicate Pulp, whereas a fat and moiſt Earth renders its Skin rough, and the Pulp groſs and courſe.</p>
                           <p>They might as well make different kinds of great and little, of horned and crumpled, of well ſhaped and well look'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would be a very ridiculous fancy, which is carefully to be avoided.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Winter-Boncretien</hi> then, ſuch a one, in a word, as is every where known by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality for ſuch, without ever changing its Name, as moſt other Fruits have done. This <hi>Boncretien,</hi> I ſay, ſhould be then the <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> that I would Plant in a little Garden well qualified, where it ſhould be deſign'd to Plant but only one <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree;</hi> and this ſame <hi>Pear-tree</hi> ſhould be likewiſe the firſt I would chuſe, not only for a Garden in which I ſhould have room for a ſecond <hi>Dwarf,</hi> but alſo for all the other Gardens alike well qualified for it, in which I ſhould have room for many more ſuch Trees, and particularly if there were but little Walling for thoſe Trees that ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that Station. And this <hi>Boncretien-tree</hi> ſhould firſt be graffed upon a <hi>Quince:</hi> ſtock, chiefly becauſe the <hi>Boncretien-Dwarfs</hi> graffed on <hi>Free-</hi>ſtocks, commonly bring Fruit
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48210:68"/>
ſpotted, ſmall, crumpled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And conſequently diſagreeable to the ſight: In the ſecond place, it ſhould be Planted in that part of the Garden facing the <hi>Wall trees,</hi> neareſt the Wall expoſed to the moſt favourable Sun; and laſtly, immediately after the End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I would have the leaves taken off that hindred the Sun from ſhining upon the Fruit, which are all Precautions extreamly important.</p>
                           <p>I am not yet ſpeaking of thoſe Country Gardens that want all the good Qualities, and other good Conditions which we have newly deſcribed in reſpect to the ordering of ſmall Gardens, and which yet I could wiſh to all good Fruit <hi>Trees;</hi> for then I ſhould be of a very different Sentiment from that I declare my ſelf of here in regard to our <hi>Boncretien;</hi> for I would Plant but little of it there, unleſs it were in the Figure of <hi>Wall-trees;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolv'd, in fine, whatever it coſt, to Plant ſome <hi>Boncretiens</hi> in all ſorts of Gardens, ſince, in Truth, we have nothing better for the End of <hi>Winter,</hi> than this Noble Fruit.</p>

                        <p>We have above all the reſt, Six different ſorts of <hi>Pears</hi> that put in briskly for this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, nay, and which can hardly brook without murmuring, that the <hi>Boncretien</hi> ſhould peaceably enjoy the Honour it has newly received, which are the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> the <hi>Autumn Bergamot,</hi> the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> the <hi>Leſchaſſerie,</hi> the <hi>Winter Ambret</hi> and <hi>Winter Thorn-pear:</hi> Nay, and beſides there are, the ancient <hi>Petit-oin,</hi> the <hi>Louiſe-bonne</hi> or <hi>Good Louiſe,</hi> with four new Commers, namely, the <hi>St. Germain,</hi> the <hi>Colmar,</hi> the <hi>Craſanne,</hi> and the <hi>Marquiſs</hi> or <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> which finding themſelves provided with ſufficient Merit, want not the Ambition to enter into this Diſpute, every one of theſe Twelve pretending ſeverally to have more Perfections, and fewer Defects than any one of its Rivals, or, at leaſt, to be nothing inferior to them; and accordingly pretending too, to win from them the Place that is here in Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>And I grant, they all have ſuch powerful Motives for their ſeveral Pretentions, that we cannot be cenſured to have made an ill Choice to which of them ſoever we ſhall give the Preference: However, my Judgment is, That theſe Six laſt ought to retire for a time, and leave the Six firſt to fight out this Quarrel; and I ſhall give, if I be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, ſuch good Reaſons for it, that I hope their Patrons will be ſatisfied with them.

                        <p>I begin with thoſe of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> concerning which I muſt firſt lay it down for a Concluſion, That as well the red <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Ambroiſe</hi> or <hi>Iſambert</hi> of the <hi>Normans,</hi> as the grey <hi>Butter</hi> and green <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> are but one and the ſame thing; for that oftentimes all theſe pretended Sorts are found upon one and the ſame Tree, thoſe differences of Colour having no other Foundation in a manner than thoſe which we have remarked in the <hi>Boncretien;</hi> the fair Expoſition of them, or perhaps an indifferent weak Temper either in the whole Tree, or in any particular Branch, producing red <hi>Pears;</hi> and a ſhady Situation, and the vigour either of the whole Tree, or of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Branch of it, making grey or green ones: And the <hi>Quince</hi> and <hi>Free-ſtocks</hi> upon which theſe <hi>Pear-trees</hi> are graffed, ſhew themſelves by the different Colours with which they tinge their Fruit, the Colour of the Fruit of the <hi>Pear-trees</hi> on Free-ſtocks being quite another thing from that of the <hi>Boncretien</hi> graffed on a <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtock: Beſides which, the dryneſs or moiſtneſs of the Soil in which they grow, fail not to imprint ſome Marlts and Features of their own Faſhion.</p>
                        <p>This being firſt laid down as a neceſſary Remark, the Reaſons of this <hi>Butter-pear</hi> are, <note place="margin">The Deſcription and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Butter-pear.</hi>
                           </note> firſt, That it is poſſeſs'd in ſuch Perfection of the firſt Degree of Goodneſs, that is to be deſired in Fruits, which is a ſmooth delicious melting Softneſs, that the Name of <hi>Butter-pear</hi>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48210:68"/>
was for that Quality given it by way of Excellence; and, in effect, its name is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to give to others whoſe Merit we would Extol, and therefore this <hi>Pear</hi> believes to <note place="margin">The Conditions neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Pear.</hi>
                           </note> have Right to pretend, that not one of the other <hi>Pears</hi> ſhould diſpute with it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream abundance of Juice, nor for a fine and delicate Pulp, and rich Taſte, which are all the Conditions neceſſary to conſtitute an excellent <hi>Pear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Place, it pretends to have the advantage to charm the ſight, as well by the bigneſs of its Body, as the goodlineſs of its Figure, and Beauty of its Colour.</p>
                        <p>In the third place it is perſwaded, It may hope all Things from the Happineſs it has to be extreamly fertile; ſo that commonly every Year, and in all ſorts of Ground it is loaden almoſt ready to break, and ſucceeds as well upon a Free-ſtock, as upon a Quince one, and almoſt as well under the Hands of Ignorant as of Able Gard'ners; beſides, that it is ſeldom or never apt to be Doughy, Inſipid and Mealy, as are moſt other tender <hi>Pears,</hi> and that not only, it is not ſo incommoded by the full Air as the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> but alſo bears ſooner than the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> and produces fairer Fruit than any of its Competitors. Here are without doubt a great many Reaſons, and all of great Weight and Authority, ſtrongly to prove and confirm the right of the <hi>Butter-pears</hi> claim in this Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Nay, its Friends would fain believe further, That if the <hi>Butter pear</hi> could be had at all Seaſons of the Years, and we could cure our ſelves of the natural Curioſity we have for Change, and for the Variety of Fruits, that in that caſe, we ought not to think of any other than this Famous <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> it being certain, That it is really ſo Excellent, that by the Confeſſion of all, at the End of <hi>September</hi> when it begins to ripen, we are well enough content to ſee the <hi>Peaches</hi> paſs away, which is to ſay, a great deal in its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Autumn Bergamot</hi> making no great Account of all that has juſt now been ſaid in <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Autumn Bergamot,</note> Favour of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> preſents it ſelf to ſtop this Queſtion of Precedence from being ſo ſoon decided: Its Party is very numerous and formidable, which is as much as to ſay, its Excellence is very much known: And indeed I ſee a Thouſand People that aſſert, <note place="margin">Its Deſcription and Character.</note> That if it be conſidered with reſpect to all the Ingredient Parts of its Goodneſs; that is to ſay, its tender and melting Pulp, its ſweet and ſugred Juice, and the little ſmack of Perfume that accompanies it, it is more valuable than all the other <hi>Pears</hi> in general; they alſo affirm, That Fruitfulneſs is not much leſs on the <hi>Bergamots</hi> ſide, than on that of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> ſince it is ordinarily loaded with a ſufficient abundance, and ſo quickly repays the pains of thoſe that Cultivate it. Add to this, that contrary to what we find by the Experience we have of almoſt all other Fruits, it may be ſaid in its Favour, and with Truth, That a midling <hi>Bergamot-pear</hi> is as good as the biggeſt, nay, and that very often it is the midling one that is the moſt Excellent, though it may have appeared to be the moſt deſpiſable, which Advantage ought to be eſteemed as a ſingular and conſiderable Argument in its Favour. This <hi>Pear</hi> commonly uſes to furniſh the End of <hi>October</hi> and part of <hi>November,</hi> and ſometimes paſſes on as far as <hi>December,</hi> which gives a wonderful Pleaſure to our Curious Gentlemen; ſo that, in truth, we had need to provide our ſelves with Trees of them in different Expoſitions, in divers ſorts of Ground, and upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stocks; that is to ſay, Graffed upon Free-ſtocks, and upon <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtocks, and in the various Figures of <hi>Dwarf-trees, Wall-trees,</hi> and even of <hi>Standards</hi> too, the better to aſſiſt the Inclination this <hi>Pear</hi> ſeems to have, to entertain us ſeveral Months together.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall note by the by, That you are not to believe there is any other difference in <hi>Bergamot-pears</hi> (I man thoſe of <hi>Autumn</hi> and not of <hi>Summer)</hi> but what conſiſts in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour only, but then that difference is real; for indeed there is one of a greeniſh grey, which is ſimply named the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> or the <hi>Common Bergamot,</hi> or the <hi>Pear de la Hiliere,</hi> or <hi>de Recous, &amp;c.</hi> they all ſignifying but one thing; and there is another that is ſtrip'd with yellow and green ſtreaks, which makes it be called the <hi>Suiſſe-Bergamot,</hi> this motley Colour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at the ſame time both in the Wood and in the Fruit; but as to their internal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, it ſeems to me to be equal both in the one and the other, when they are both as good as they ſhould be; they alſo agree together in the ſame proportion of bigneſs, which is ſometimes of three Inches Diameter in thickneſs, but moſt commonly but of one and a half or two Inches; they likewiſe agree both in having a flattiſh ſhape, and an Eye or Crown ſinking hollow in, and a ſhort and ſmall Stalk, and poliſh'd and yellowiſh Skin, and a little moiſtiſh when it is ripe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Would to God it were true, there were a ſort of <hi>Latter Bergamots,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>Lent Bergamots,</hi> and that every Year we could be ſure to have ſome of them till the End of <hi>March,</hi> as ſometimes it happens; for in that caſe we might have juſt Grounds to brag, that we had for, at leaſt, four or five Months in the Year, the real Treaſure of Fruits.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48210:69"/>
Some certain curious Perſons would fain have perſwaded themſelves and me too, that they infallibly had this ſort of latter <hi>Bergamots;</hi> but to my great regret, I cannot forbear confeſſing, that to this preſent time I have not been able to convince my ſelf that I have attained any ſuch good Fortune, although in truth I have been wanting neither in Care, nor Diligence, nor in any other Precaution that might contribute to the making a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that Importance; for what have I attempted for that End, what in Pains and what in Expences, is inſinite as well as to no purpoſe, and the particular Account and Relation of it would be but troubleſom and diſagreeable.</p>
                        <p>That which has given occaſion to ſpeak of ſuch Things as late <hi>Bergamots,</hi> is, That in ſome very rainy Years, or from ſome <hi>Soils</hi> more fat and moiſt, or in ſome Expoſition leſs Sunny, or from ſome Tree more Vigorous than ordinary, we commonly keep ſome as long as till <hi>Lent,</hi> and thereupon we take pleaſure to deceive our ſelves with the hopes of having the like every Year: But, the truth is, that commonly chance has more part in all this than any thing elſe; for the ſame Tree which produces ſome for the Month of <hi>October,</hi> yields ſome others likewiſe ſometimes for the Month of <hi>March,</hi> which happens chiefly when any particular Branch of it has bloſſom'd much later than the reſt, the <hi>Pears</hi> which were the laſt in knitting, being commonly the laſt that ripen on that Tree; but that happens but very rarely: Or elſe we may ſay very probably, That the <hi>Bergamots</hi> we have ſo in the latter Seaſons, are of the growth of ſuch <hi>Standard-trees</hi> as are Grafted upon <hi>Free-ſtocks,</hi> and perhaps but little ſhone upon by the Sun; the ſucceſs of ſuch Trees being ordinarily very dubious and uncertain, and particularly for the producing of <hi>Pears</hi> that are fair, agreeable to the ſight, and good and backward. But howſoever ſome ſuch are ſometimes gathered, which keep a little longer than thoſe that grow on <hi>Wall-trees</hi> and <hi>Dwarfs:</hi> And therefore it were to purpoſe enough not for the Curious, of whom we treat here, that have but a very little Ground, but for thoſe that have a great deal, to venture to Plant ſome of them in all manner of Faſhions; for, in fine, they ought not to fail to make what Proviſion they can of <hi>Bergamot-pears.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe aboveſaid Advantages of the good kind of <hi>Bergamot,</hi> it has yet another that methinks exalts it much above the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> in what concerns the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, which is, that the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> meets often at the ſame time with the <hi>Peaches, Figs</hi> and <hi>Muſcat-Grapes</hi> of mid-<hi>September,</hi> three ſorts of good Fruits that all the World paſſionately affect, and in favour of which it may be ſaid, That among all Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Nice and Knowing Perſons, they are ſo well received, that ſcarcely any <hi>Pears</hi> dare venture into their Company; whereas the <hi>Bergamot</hi> ripens not till thoſe <hi>Peaches, Figs</hi> and <hi>Muſcats,</hi> nay, and the very <hi>Butter-pears</hi> and <hi>Verte-longues,</hi> or <hi>green-long-pears</hi> are ended, and ſo comes in all alone towards the end of <hi>October,</hi> that is to ſay, in a time when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its aſſiſtance, we ſhould be reduced to a great ſcarcity of good Fruits, the <hi>Pears</hi> call'd the <hi>Lanſac,</hi> the <hi>ſugar-green,</hi> the <hi>Flowery-Muſcat, Rouſſeline, Bezi de la mote, Vine pear, Meſſire-John,</hi> &amp;c. not worthily enough ſupplying the place of thoſe laſt paſſed; and therefore by conſequence, from hence they would pretend, That as to what concerns a little Garden, and that for the Reaſons declared in the beginning of this Third Book, it is more convenient to Plant in it, for a ſecond <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> a <hi>Bergamot,</hi> than any other <hi>Pear-tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Partiſans of the two preceding <hi>Pears,</hi> the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Bergamot,</hi> are methinks ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to hear ſay there are any that dare to enter the Liſts againſt them; and whatſoever the others can alledge they look upon as a piece of Raſhneſs, and therefore will hardly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to hear them; and if they conſent to it, 'tis only to anſwer them in Terms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Raillery, or rather with deſign to gain their cauſe againſt them with ſo much the more Glory and Security.</p>
                        <p>But for all that, the <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Virgoulé,</hi> which they call <hi>Bujaleuf</hi> in <hi>Angoumois, Chambretie</hi> in <hi>Limouſin</hi> or the Province of <hi>Limoges,</hi> the <hi>Ice-pear</hi> in <hi>Gaſcony, Virgoleſe</hi> and <hi>Virgouleuſe</hi> in ſo many other Places, and which after the Example of the <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>Beſidery, L'Eſchaſſerie,</hi> &amp;c. ought, in my Opinion, to bear the plain Name of <hi>Virgoule</hi> before any other; that which makes me judge ſo, is, becauſe we had it from a Village called <hi>Virgoulé,</hi> near the Town of St. <hi>Leonard</hi> in the <hi>Limouſin</hi> Countty, where, in all appearance, it had paſſed a long time without any Luſtre, neither more nor leſs than juſt as a Pearl ſhut up in its Shell; but at laſt, as well for the Happineſs of our curious Gentlemen, as for the Ornament of our Gardens, it was advanced out of that Village by the Liberality of the Marqueſs of <hi>Chambret,</hi> who was Lord of it, and who was pleaſed to give it us under the Name of his <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Virgoulé;</hi> ſince which time it has begun to make it ſelf be talked on as Famous, ſo that at this Day, notwitſtanding the Brags, I ſay, of the two preceding <hi>Pears,</hi> it, not without Reaſon enough, pretends to the Honour which is here propoſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48210:69"/>
It is a <hi>Pear</hi> of a Figure pretty long and thick, being three or four Inches long, and two or three in thickneſs; its Stalk is ſhort, fleſhy and bending; its Eye or Crown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently great and a little hollow; its Skin ſmooth and poliſh'd, and ſometimes coloured, and which from green, which it was upon the Tree, grows yellow as it ripens, and in ripening grows tender and melting; ſo that when it is well nick'd in the gathering, it proves one of the beſt Fruits of the World: And accordingly its Reputation has made ſuch a Progreſs, ſince, that in a few Years time, it has ſpread it ſelf into as many Gardens all over <hi>Europe,</hi> as any Pear that we know.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Virgoulee-pear,</hi> priding it ſelf, as it may ſeem, as well in the Extraordinary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour that accompanies its Tree in all Places, and draws to it the Admiration of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, as alſo in the Merit it pretends to be ennobled with, and beſides being offended at the injurious Contempt with which it was but now treated by the others, aſſerts for the Eſtabliſhing of its Right, That Nature has not only endowed it with all the good Qualities, namely, of a tender and melting Pulp, an Abundance of ſweet and ſugred Juice, and a fine rich Taſte, and of a plentiful Increaſe, which render the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Bergamot-pears</hi> ſo conſiderable; but that beſides, that it has the aſſured Advantage to begin to ripen almoſt as ſoon as the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> and yet to laſt much longer than that; and in earneſt it alledges, That often from the very beginning of <hi>November,</hi> it is in a condition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Curious, which happens to thoſe of them that are raiſed upon <hi>Wall-trees</hi> expoſed to a good Sun, or that grow otherwiſe in a dry and light Soil, and that particularly it ſignalizes it ſelf by furniſhing a great quantity of Fruit all the reſt of <hi>November,</hi> all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> and ſometimes for part of <hi>January,</hi> which cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> and but little, or, at leaſt, very rarely, and by pure hazard, of the <hi>Bergamot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which induces the <hi>Virgoule-pear-tree</hi> to demand pretty boldly, whether it be not true, that its Fruit is not only Excellent for Taſte, but of an agreeable Figure to the Eye, ſo that thoſe <hi>Pears</hi> of it that grow in a fair Expoſition, acquire an admirable vermilion bluſh; this <hi>Pear-tree</hi> further demands, if it has not the gift to form the faireſt Trees of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruit-plants, and to ſucceed admirably well in the Figure of a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> that is to ſay, in that very manner of Trees, the Planting of which is at preſent in Queſtion; it alſo further maintains, That the Diſtinctions of dry or moiſt Grounds, of <hi>Free</hi> or <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtocks, and of <hi>Standards</hi> or <hi>Wall-</hi>trees, are ordinarily of no ſuch great Importance to its Wood, as they are to that of the <hi>Bergamots;</hi> though in reſpect of the inward good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fruit, thoſe ſorts of Differences work almoſt the ſame Effects as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: It is then true, that the <hi>Virgoulees</hi> are not only not ſubjected to that ſort of Scabbineſs which disfigures the <hi>Bergamot-trees,</hi> and renders them hideous to look on, and too often kills them, or at leaſt hinders their Fruitfulneſs; but on the contrary, ſhoot out regularly on all ſides, ſtore of fair Branches, and are ſeen always with a ſmooth and ſhining Complexion; as if really one had taken the care to rub them, to make them bright.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Virgoulee</hi> therefore pretends, That the time of its continuance in maturity, which is about Three Months, and the Beauty of its Tree, which never fails, ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail here to carry the Cauſe for it, againſt both the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Bergamot-pear,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all other <hi>Pears</hi> which would oppoſe it, ſince, beſides thoſe Advantges, it is Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none of the reſt, either for Abundance of Increaſe, or in the Point of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Leſchaſſerie-pear,</hi> which ſome call the <hi>Winter Green-long</hi> or <hi>Verte-longue,</hi> and others <hi>Beſidery-ſandry,</hi> and which has not appeared in our Gardens above Twenty Years; this <hi>Pear,</hi> I ſay, might put in alone for a Title here, ſo ſtrong is its Party; but it chuſes however rather to join with the <hi>Ambret-pear,</hi> which is of ancient ſtanding among us, and in great eſteem, and is called in ſome Countries by the Name of <hi>Cheat-Servant</hi> or <hi>Trompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48210:70"/>
is greeniſh and ſpeckled, though the <hi>Ambret</hi> be commonly of a deeper and ruddier Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the <hi>Leſchaſſerie</hi> lighter and yellower, but eſpecially when it grows ripe. Theſe two <hi>Pears</hi> further in ſome degree reſemble one another in their Stalks, which in both of them are ſtrait and pretty long, though that of the <hi>Leſchaſſerie</hi> be a little thicker of the two; and in fine, they reſemble one another as well in the time of their ripening or mellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>January,</hi> as in the fine and butter-like ſubſtance of their Pulp, and in their ſugred and ſomewhat perfumed Juice, but that is perfumed with a ſcent ſo agreeable, that nothing can be wiſhed for more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: The <hi>Leſchaſſerie</hi> has a little more of it than its aſſociate, and the Pulp of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret</hi> is ſometimes a little more greeniſh; its Kernels are blacker, and, as one may ſay, lodged more at large in their Apartments, than the Kernels of the other, and even the Skin of it feels ordinarily a little rougher; and beſides the <hi>Leſchaſſerie pears</hi> are pretty often, as one may term them, bunch'd and warty; but as to the Wood of their Trees, they are very different one from the other, in that the Wood of the <hi>Ambret</hi> is extreamly thorny and prickly, and is exactly like one of thoſe wild Trees commonly ſeen in Hedges and Thickets, which Quality is not to be found in that of the <hi>Leſchaſſerie-tree,</hi> which is commonly pretty ſlender, and ſhoots forth ſome Points but not ſharp enough to prick the Fingers of them that meddle with it, as do the <hi>Ambret-trees.</hi> Theſe two <hi>Pears</hi> found the Pretentions of their Claim of Preference upon the Fault that is found with the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> about the time of its ripening, and upon that objected againſt the <hi>Bergamot</hi> for its Scabby Wood; and laſtly upon that Accuſation brought againſt the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> not only for being ſo long before it bears, but for having ſome kind of diſagreeableneſs in its Taſte; ſo that having at leaſt all the good Qualities of thoſe <hi>Pears,</hi> both in their Fruit, and in the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Plants to be wrought into beautiful Figures of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> without participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any of their Defects, they pretend it their Right to be preferred before thoſe which are ſo notably incommoded with them, that they can neither avoid nor diſguiſe them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Winter Thorn pear,</hi> which well knows its own worth, will not let it ſelf be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned neither without ſpeaking for it ſelf: It is a very fine <hi>Pear</hi> that approaches nearera Pyramidical than a round Figure, though it has almoſt no part that is ſmall in its ſhape, ſo that it ends in very little or nothing of a bluntiſh Point towards the Stalk, which Stalk is pretty ſhort and ſmall, except where it comes out of the <hi>Pear,</hi> where it is a little fleſhy; every where elſe the <hi>Pear</hi> is all over in a manner of the ſame bigneſs, being about Two or Three Inches thick towards the Head; it is particularly much bigger than the ordinary <hi>Bergamot,</hi> or than the <hi>Ambret</hi> and <hi>Leſchaſſerie;</hi> it has a ſatiny Skin, and a Colour between Green and White; it ſometimes Ripens before the two laſt preceding ones, but moſt commonly at the ſame time with them, and ſometimes too after them; it is likewiſe of a tender and butter-like Conſiſtence, having ordinarily a very fine and delicate Pulp, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Taſte, and a ſweet Juice reliſhed with an admirable ſmack of Perfume; it alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces fine <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and proſpers as well on <hi>Free</hi> as on <hi>Quince-tree-ſtocks,</hi> when the Stocks are good, and the Ground is well qualified, that is, of a dry rather than moiſt Temper. It has little to ſay againſt the two laſt, and eſpecially againſt the <hi>Leſchaſſeries,</hi> and ingenuouſly confeſſes the good Qualities of both of them, but yet without conſenting to give them the Precedence, till there ſhall be a Regulation for it; but as for the other <hi>Pears,</hi> it objects to them the ſame Defects which theſe laſt juſt now Reproached them with.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore now the Queſtion how to terminate this Conteſtation which has appeared but too long, upon which, having maturely examined all the Reaſons alledged by each of them, I confeſs I have a very particular eſteem for every one of them; but yet, in regard to the Trees which give them us, we muſt not judge the Queſtion here under Diſcuſſion, altogether upon the ſame Foundation as if we were only examining the Merit of each Fruit in particular, and by comparing them only one with the other; for upon the bare Foot of Merit, in what Garden ſoever it were, where there were to be but two <hi>Dwarf pear-trees,</hi> I ſhould ever incline to give the ſecond place to the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> which I honour infinitely, and that, methinks, cannot be too much honoured, as being as it were the Queen of <hi>Pears:</hi> For indeed it is like the Excellent <hi>Muskmelons,</hi> its Pulp appearing at firſt firm, without being hard or ſtony, and fine and melting without being Doughy or Mealy, and its Juice ſugred and a little Perfumed without having any mixture of ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or wildneſs; and laſtly, its Taſte rich, and wonderfully delicious, and accompanied with ſomething of Noble: For ſuch a <hi>Pear</hi> as that, may it not vaunt to have approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very near the Perfection of Fruits, and ought it not to ſerve for a Rule and Model to all thoſe that ſhall pretend to be entred into the Catalogue of good Fruits?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48210:70"/>
This Deciſion, in favour of the <hi>Bergamot</hi> to the Excluſion of the other <hi>Pears,</hi> would not at all ſurprize thoſe curious Perſons that have taſted thoſe that are really good; for aſſuredly it excels the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> which cannot deny but it has a little mixture of ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in its Juice; it ſurpaſſes the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> in that it is a nimbler-bearing Tree than that, and is not at all ſubject to that little odd ſtrawy Taſte, which, as I may ſo ſay, perſecutes the moſt part of the <hi>Virgoulee pears,</hi> and does them a Thouſand ill Offices in good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; it no leſs ſurmounts the other three Competitors, the <hi>Leſchaſſerie,</hi> the <hi>Ambret</hi> and the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> becauſe that certainly they have nothing in them more Excellent nor more Advantageous than our <hi>Bergamot</hi> in the point of perfect goodneſs, but, as one may ſay, without any deſign to offend them, that both the one and the other have ſometimes the ill hap to have a faint and inſipid Juice, and a hard or meally Pulp: But theſe Faults are not to be objected againſt thoſe kinds of Fruits in general, but are rather Defects that proceed from the Coldneſs or Moiſtneſs of the Year, the badneſs of the Soil, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Expoſition in which they were produced.</p>
                        <p>Yet that which may ſometimes hinder the <hi>Bergamot</hi> from receiving the benefit of this my Declaration, is, the unhappineſs the Wood of its Tree has to be of ſo delicate a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that inſtead of making an agreeable Spectacle in Gardens, it does often but vex its Owner with its Scabbineſs, which is an evil that every where almoſt perſecutes both its Fruit and Tree. And that is the Reaſon I do not willingly venture to Counſel the Planting any of them any where in the Figure of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and much leſs in little Gardens: But yet, if notwithſtanding this Deformity, which ſo much diſobliges the Eyes, any Perſons be minded, becauſe of the Excellence of its Fruit, to Plant any of them in all ſorts of Gardens, whether great or ſmall, ſuppoſing always the Ground to be fitly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I would have thoſe choſen that are graffed upon <hi>Free-ſtocks;</hi> but if the Ground be fatty and a little moiſt, then I would adviſe them to take thoſe that are Graffed on <hi>Quince-ſtocks,</hi> and further, I would wiſh them to take the <hi>Striped Bergamot,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Suiſſe Bergamot,</hi> rather than the common one, becauſe being both of an equal goodneſs, and as difficult to Rear the one as the other, it ſeems in my Judgment more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to fix firſt upon the <hi>Striped</hi> one before we Plant any of the other ſort, becauſe it has the advantage to ſurpaſs this latter in Beauty of Colours; but, in fine, if none be Planted of either of them in the form of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> we ſhould not fail however to Plant a great many <hi>Wall-trees</hi> of them in great Gardens; and I would have one <hi>Standard tree</hi> of them Planted, to make a Figure in a great ſpace which without that, would appear too much Ungarniſh'd. But above all, it is moſt advantageous to Plant one of them in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of a great Wall expoſed to a good Sun; for I have had very great Satisfaction in doing in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>Verſailles</hi> what I now Counſel to others: I alſo Plant ſome of them of the ſize of half <hi>Standards,</hi> as well in the middle of Squares, as on the ſides, and particularly I plant ſome of them at two or three foot diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in Nurſery-Gardens; and I take the ſame way with all the other delicate ſorts, as the <hi>Petit-oins,</hi> the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>Louiſe-bonne</hi> or <hi>good Louiſe,</hi> the <hi>Sugar-green,</hi> &amp;c. to which a cold and moiſt Earth is abſolutely contrary, and I gather from them for Eight or Ten Years, a conſiderable quantity of very good Fruits, and when thoſe Trees grow too big and ſeem to encumber the place where they are, I take them away, and plant young Ones elſewhere, to have the ſame Aſſiſtance from them as long as 'tis poſſible.</p>
                        <p>The Article concerning this <hi>Bergamot-pear,</hi> has given a great deal of trouble to decide it; I return now at laſt to declare my Judgment of thoſe ſorts of Trees which, together with the Beauty of their Fruit, have the Advantage to be graced with a beautiful Wood: <note place="margin">The ſecond place adjudged to a <hi>Dwarf-pear-tree,</hi> wherein the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> is to be prefered to the <hi>Virgoulee.</hi>
                           </note> And therefore I incline here to give the ſecond Place to the <hi>Butter-pear-tree.</hi>

                           <p>The laſt Reproach which was made to the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> concerning ſome Oddneſs often found in its Taſte, will be favourable to the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> to maintain it in a Rank before that; beſides a particular Right of Antiquity of this <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> that has procured it a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Veneration among all the World, to which the latter cannot ſo ſoon pretend, as alſo its ready Facility in bearing, which is an advantage belonging to the <hi>Butter-pear-tree</hi> preferably to the <hi>Virgoulee;</hi> and laſtly, beſides that 'tis certain, though they be both admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet may we truly ſay, that generally ſpeaking, the <hi>Butter-pear</hi> makes it ſelf more deſired by all the World than the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> and therefore that this latter ought to give place to a firſt <hi>Butter-pear-tree</hi> in little Gardens, which have but two <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> in all.</p>

                              <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48210:71"/>
And for its Conſolation, it may expect its turn will come very quickly to be treated elſewhere much better than the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> that is, much more multiplied in Trees of its Kind; for in this reſpect, it will in a very high degree ſurpaſs the other in moſt great Gardens, which we ſhall afterwards Plant.</p>
                           <p>But yet it is of a great Importance to this <hi>Virgoulee-pear,</hi> that we ſhould not leave it <note place="margin">How to prevent the ill Taſte in <hi>Virgoulee-Pears,</hi> and from what Cauſe that Taſte proceeds.</note> under the Defamation of the publick Reproach which the other <hi>Pears</hi> caſt upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its odd Taſte. We cannot deny but there have been many of theſe <hi>Pears</hi> found with that Defect; but then 'tis not impoſſible to exempt them from it; for it proceeds from their having been too long kept upon Hay or Straw, or perhaps too long ſmothered up in ſome Cupboard, where they had no Air, or in a kind of Cellar, which is never without ſome Taſte of Muſt; or elſe in ſome Fruit-ſtore-houſe too cloſe kept ſhut, when full of other ſorts of Fruits, and perhaps in ſome part of it Infected with ſome ſtrong Smell whatever it be: For all thoſe Scents together make but a very diſagreeable Smell, of which this kind of <hi>Pear</hi> is unhappily very ſuſceptible. The only Remedy in Queſtion is then, to put them up in ſome place where none of theſe Inconveniences are to be met with, and conſequently having a Fruit-loft for that purpoſe, well Qualified againſt the great Cold and Moiſture, the Boards of it muſt be covered with ſome Moſs extreamly well dried; and then the <hi>Pears</hi> muſt be placed on it at a diſtance one from the other, and Air muſt be given them as often as the Weather is fair: With theſe kinds of Precautions, which are not very difficult, we may be aſſured to have all Winter long theſe <hi>Virgoulee-pears</hi> preſerved from any ill Taſte. They are, as we have ſaid, fair and large, and moſt excellent, provided firſt, that, without being too much wrinkled, they appear only a little <note place="margin">The Marks of goodneſs or bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Virgoulee-pears.</hi>
                              </note> withered; and ſecondly, that they be yellow almoſt all over the whole Extent of their Skin; and thirdly, if in ſqueezing them a little with the Thumb near the Stalk, they give way without ſhewing any ſoftneſs at the Heart; that is to ſay, in fine, if they come ſo well to ripen and mellow, that their Pulp is become tender and melting: For if, though in appearance ripe, they remain firm and hard, as it happens ſometimes to them that have been laid up in moiſt Places, or which are of the Product of a very Rainy Summer, or of ſome <hi>Northern</hi> Expoſition, or ſome cold and watriſh Soil, then it cannot be denied but that theſe ſort of <hi>Pears</hi> prove both mealy and inſipid, and by conſequence diſagreeable. So it is, that among the Things of this World, that are the moſt perfect, there may be ſome of them that may fall into Corruption, and at the ſame time into Contempt; but the Fault of one particular thing ought not to be made a matter of Reproach to the whole general Kind.</p>
                           <p>One thing that is extraordinary enough, I have to remark concerning theſe <hi>Pears,</hi> is, <note place="margin">A ſingular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark about <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulee-pears.</hi>
                              </note> That ſuch of them as perhaps fell off the Tree, or were gathered about Fifteen Days before they ſhould have been, and which becauſe of that grow a little withered (for if they were much ſo, they would be deſpiſable in all manner of Reſpects) theſe ſort of <hi>Pears,</hi> I ſay, though a little unhandſom to look upon, yet at length being throughly mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, are almoſt always of an admirable Taſte, which can be hardly ſaid of any other Fruit: But yet I do not Counſel any to gather them very long before their time; as for Example, before the End of <hi>September,</hi> becauſe the ordinary Winds that Reign at that time, ſpare them, and ſometimes more than they deſire, the taking of that Pains; and therefore we may comfort our ſelves then, when any of them happen to fall, with the Expectation that they will mellow later than the reſt, and will be leſs ſubject to grow doughy, and we ſhall be apt to wiſh it may happen oftner, that we may without fail have ſome <hi>Pears</hi> that may be good, and at the ſame time fair, ſound and indifferently wrinkled. I ſhall in another place explain to you more particularly what time they are to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what are the infallible marks of their true Maturity, as well as of that of all other Fruits; which are Articles of very great Importance, and in which conſiſt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Points of our Curioſity.</p>

For indeed, this <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> when it grows in a Country hot enough, in a dry Ground, and a good Expoſition, in Years moderately rainy, and upon a <hi>Standard</hi> or half <hi>Standard-tree</hi> well placed, is ſo perfect in all its Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that it equals the delicateneſs of the Pulp of good <hi>Peaches,</hi> and is of ſuch Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that the name of <hi>Marvellous</hi> has been given it in the Provinces of <hi>Angoumois, Xantoigne</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi> Provinces ſituated in a marvellous Climate, and which are known to be famous for the great number of Sorts of good Fruits they produce, and of Perſons of Quality that divertiſe themſelves there in Gardenage: And I confeſs in good Truth, That among all <hi>Pears,</hi> I find none better than this, when it attains the full goodneſs of its kind; but, at the ſame time.

                           <p>There truly ſtill remains a ſmall Reproach to be made to this <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> becauſe it ripens ſometimes at the ſame time with the other <hi>Pears</hi> which I have newly placed before it, and conſequently according to thoſe Regards I always have in making this Choice, and from which it will be convenient I ſhould never depart, it would be much better to Plant ſome good Fruit of another Seaſon in this little Garden, rather than this <hi>Pear;</hi> but to this I anſwer, That ſince this objected Inconvenience of over-haſty ripening, happens but very ſeldom, inſtead of baniſhing the <hi>Thorn-pear</hi> from hence for ſuch a Reproach as that, we ought rather to be careful to plant it there, and eſpecially if there be already no <hi>Bergamot</hi> Dwarf-tree, becauſe it makes a very agreeable Dwarf-tree, and eaſily takes to bear.</p>

                           <p>I prefer it alſo before the two moſt valuable <hi>Summer-pears,</hi> which are the Famous <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> and the Illuſtrious <hi>Robine,</hi> but it is but one degree only to make it march imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before them; and theſe latter in their turn ſhall be preferred before thoſe other five, which are of ſo great Reputation.

For my part, I make ſo great account of both of them, that I do not think a Garden that may contain Seven or Eight <hi>Dwarf-pear-trees,</hi> ought to be without one <hi>Ruſſelet</hi> and one <hi>Robine-tree;</hi> which when we have placed, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine what good and conſiderable Qualities the other <hi>Pears</hi> can plead, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the doing them that ſpeedy Juſtice thereupon, which we think to be their Due.</p>
                           <p>Would to God, that in the matter of good Pears, the Months of <hi>January, February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> were able to furniſh me as many ſubjects of Diſputes and Conteſtation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as I am plied with by the four preceding Months; for theſe latter being ſo poor and barren as they are, have great need of aſſiſtance; but when there will come any to them, I cannot tell. Certain it is, 'twould be a great good Fortune to them, if they poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any of thoſe good Pears, which pour in in Shoals upon us, as I may ſay, about the End of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Winter;</hi> I loſe not a moment of Time in ſtudying and uſing all imaginable means, as I have before ſaid, to bring about ſo great a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>But to return to my purpoſe, I proceed then to place theſe two laſt Pears, of which we were but now ſpeaking, aſſuredly expecting, that my Choice of them will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. For, methinks, we ought not to delay any longer to introduce here ſome <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-pears,</hi> having already placed ſix Sorts of other Seaſons: But what muſt I do to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Diſpute that's like to riſe between theſe two Pears, which ſhall be the firſt? Why, I will not undertake to decide it of my own Head, it being a Cauſe too dangerous to judge of in the preſence of the Patrons of both the Parties, and therefore not to embroil my ſelf on either ſide. The way I ſhall take with them, ſhall be either to give theſe Pears an alternative Precedence to be enjoyed by each of them, in their turns, or rather even to let them fairly draw Lots for it: 'Tis not the firſt Conteſt of Precedence that has
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48210:72"/>
been determined this way and that, to the Contentment of both Parties too. So be it then, and accordingly they caſt Lots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Lot falls upon the <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> for the Garden of ſeven <hi>Dwarf trees.</hi>

'Tis true however, that thoſe that are but of a midling bigneſs, are commonly better than the faireſt (which Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation holds too in ſome other Fruits, though not in all.)

                           </p>
                           <p>I ſhall begin my Diſcourſe of this <hi>Ruſſelet-pear</hi> by telling you, There is hardly a <hi>Pear</hi> in the World more known, nor more eſteemed than it.

It commonly ripens about the End of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and at that time, in reſpect of the good Qualities with which it is endowed, I believe all the World, without heſitation, is agreed, That it may be ſaid of the <hi>Ruſſelets,</hi> as of the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamots</hi> and <hi>Leſchaſſeries,</hi> that no <hi>Pears</hi> can pretend any place in the Rank of thoſe that are Excellent; but as they proportionably approach more or leſs to the goodneſs of the <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> as well as of thoſe two other <hi>Pears.</hi> And certainly the Merit of this <hi>Ruſſelet</hi> is ſo great, that it is in nothing ſurpaſſed by its great Reputation: All Ages have Experienced it to prove good in what manner ſoever one order it. In effect, let it be raw or baked, ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or preſerv'd, or let it be prepared in form of a liquid <hi>Compote,</hi> or of a dry ſweet-meat, <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Compote,</hi> Fruit ſtew'd in Sugar, after a manner peculiar to the <hi>French.</hi>
                              </note> it equally maintains its good Character in every manner: And let it be planted in any ſort of Ground whatſoever, it will proſper. Have we a mind to have it upon a <hi>Wall-tree?</hi> It will give Content: Or, is our Fancy to Plant it in form of a <hi>Dwarf-tree?</hi> It will be admirable that way, and ſtill better upon a great <hi>Standard;</hi> nay, one may ſay in its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (which, among all Fruits, belongs, if I miſtake not, only to this) that though among its <hi>Pears</hi> there are often found ſome that are better than others, yet there is never ſeen any of them that can be ſaid to be abſolutely bad, provided it be come to its full Maturity; for thoſe that have not that, and much leſs thoſe that have too much of it, are not at all agreeable.</p>
                           <p>It is good you ſhould know here, That nothing is more contrary to this <hi>Pear,</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being Excellent, than the planting it againſt a Wall, becauſe it certainly loſes in that Situation, a part of its Perfume; but it grows fair there indeed and large, and in great abundance, and by that, in ſome meaſure, Repairs the Defect of extream Goodneſs: So that we may lay it down for a Rule, That we ought to Plant few Trees of this Fruit againſt Walls, unleſs we make more account of the bigneſs and quantity of its Fruit, than of the goodneſs and Delicacy of its Taſte; or, unleſs we think it better rather to have ſome of them, though but indifferently good, than to have none at all, that being the ordinary Effect of a <hi>Wall-tree</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Pears</hi> and <hi>Peaches;</hi> for that is of the two, what I would counſel all Perſons to chuſe, who have a great deal of Walling to garniſh, as I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more particularly ſhew, this not being the place to ſpeak of it here. I was not able to reſiſt the Temptation which over-ſway'd me, nor to forget any thing that might ſet out the Excellence of this <hi>Ruſſelet;</hi> and therefore cannot but obſerve to you, that there is ſtill one ſingular Advantage belonging to it, which is, that whereas moſt other Fruits prove unſucceſsful upon the <hi>Northern Wall-trees,</hi> yet thoſe of this <hi>Pear</hi> in that Expoſition, produce Fruit reaſonably good, ſo that it would not be amiſs to plant ſome Trees of it in thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which commonly are uſeleſs, or very bad for other Fruit.</p>
                           <p>O how happy ſhould we be, if firſt the <hi>Ruſſelet pear</hi> could keep a little longer than it does (it having the miſhap to be very ſubject to grow ſoft and pappy, 'tis its only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and one may often be deceived by it, without taking very good heed) or, if chiefly it would change place with ſo many other pitiful ſorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> ſome of which unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48210:73"/>
come in the firſt <hi>Summer-</hi>Months, and ſome again yet leſs to the purpoſe, in the midſt of <hi>Winter;</hi> ſo that this <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> inſtead of ripening as it does, at the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and beginning of <hi>September,</hi> that is to ſay, in the time of the abundance of good <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Plums,</hi> had but the Gift to come and feaſt us, either ſome time before the Maturity of the principal Stone-fruits, or ſometimes after they are paſt. I could not help making this wiſh, though it be ſo very inſignificant, and beg your Pardon for it. I know well enough, That <hi>Peaches,</hi> when they attain their natural Goodneſs are, as one may ſay, the precious <hi>Manna</hi> of our Gardens, and by the general Confeſſion of all, are more valuable than any Kernel-fruit whatſoever; ſo that few People make their Court to theſe laſt, ſo long as the <hi>Peaches</hi> with their largeneſs, fine ſhape, beautiful Colour, and the abundance of their ſweet and rich taſted Juice, together with all the reſt of their admirable Qualities, continue in a condition to charm the Eye, and move the Appetite.</p>
                           <p>But yet for all that, the <hi>Ruſſelets</hi> and the <hi>Robines</hi> are eſteemed even in the Seaſon of <hi>Peaches,</hi> how plentiful ſoever theſe latter be: And likewiſe, becauſe <hi>Peaches</hi> are commonly more faulty, and more apt to fall ſhort of their due Perfection than <hi>Pears,</hi> and that <hi>Peaches</hi> of the growth of a moiſt Soil, are good for little, therefore 'tis neceſſary for them, whoſe Ground is not very good, to precaution and provide themſelves another way, at leaſt by a ſupply of <hi>Ruſſelet-pears</hi> in their ſtead, which ſeldom fails and is never to be rejected; that at the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> which is the Seaſon of Mens eager Appetite, and moſt paſſionate deſire after Fruits, they may be furniſh'd at leaſt with ſome pretty good <hi>Pears,</hi> in caſe they be ſo unhappy as to ſee the moſt part of their <hi>Peaches</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, or prove not over good.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Pear</hi> is indeed ſmall, but it affords this convenience, that it may be gathered while 'tis yet greeniſh, to mellow afterwards off of the Tree; ſo that by that means it may be kept ſome Days, whilſt the perfection of its mellowneſs is coming on, and may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diminution of its goodneſs, be hazarded to make ſome ſmall Journies; ſo that, for Example, one may carry ſome about one, or ſend them from Province to Province, when the diſtance is not too great.</p>
                           <p>And now, after all theſe Praiſes I have given to the <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> may it not ſeem to have ſome Reaſon to complain of me, for giving it but a Seventh place? I certainly have for it as much Conſideration as any curious Perſon can have; but, in fine, that which ought to juſtifie my Conduct in this Caſe, is, That when one can compaſs ſo much as to have a Garden big enough to contain Five or Six <hi>Dwarf-pear-trees,</hi> one may and ought, in all probability, to have a proportionable quantity of <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> for <hi>Figs, Peaches, Plums</hi> and <hi>Grapes.</hi> And that ſo it would be a piece of Imprudence, for ſuch very little Places as are the Gardens we are here planting, to Counſel any one to plant any conſiderable number of Trees, both of Stone-fruit and Kernel-fruit, to ripen in one and the ſame Seaſon of the Months of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> which could not well be without running the hazard of having almoſt no Fruit at all for the moſt difficult Seaſons: And therefore I have ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Expectations upon the <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> to be ſurely furniſhed with <hi>Summer-Fruits,</hi> and have deſign'd the moſt part of the ſix firſt <hi>Pear-trees</hi> for the making a Proviſion for <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> two Seaſons which we paſs but diſagreeably without a Deſert to brisk them up; And therefore, I think, I have great Reaſon to ſay, we ought to labour to provide for them before the reſt.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Ruſſelet</hi> being thus plac'd, the <hi>Robine</hi> advances, and takes the Eighth place.</p>

                           <p>To look upon a <hi>St. Germain-pear,</hi> being very long and pretty big, and ſome of them green and a little ſpotted, ſome pretty red, and all of them growing very yellow as they ripen, with ſhort, indifferent thick and bending Stalks; one would take it for a very fine <hi>Virgoulee-pear;</hi> and thoſe of them that are but ſmall of growth, are ſomething like the <hi>St. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin-pears:</hi> This Sort of <hi>Pear</hi> comes almoſt always in at the ſame time with the <hi>Virgoulee, Thorn pear, Ambret</hi> and <hi>Leſchaſſerie,</hi> though ſometimes it comes before them, and ſometimes not till after them, which commonly depends upon the Temper and Behaviour of the <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumn;</hi> and that, as I have elſewhere ſaid, holds true, not only as to theſe <hi>Pears,</hi> but, in general, in all the fine <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter-pears;</hi> and beſides, the difference of Stocks on which thoſe ſorts are graffed, whether <hi>Free</hi> or <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtocks; and of Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more or leſs Sunny, and of Soils dry or wet, are of great Influence in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

of that Taſte, and ſome others again which happily had none at all, and were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, better to my Taſte; without doubt, the being Graffed on a <hi>Quince-</hi>ſtock, and the exceſſive drineſs of a Soil, augment this Defect; and therefore we ought to affect ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Graff them upon <hi>Free-</hi>ſtocks, and in a Ground where drineſs does not ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate; yet, I will ſay to its Honour, that this ſowriſh Taſte is found only in ſuch <hi>Pears</hi> of this ſort, that becauſe they are worm-eaten, mellow in <hi>November,</hi> and is ſeldom met with in thoſe that come not to mellow till the end of <hi>December.</hi>

                           <p>The <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Colmar</hi> came to me under that Name, from an illuſtrious curious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <note place="margin">The <hi>Colmar-pear;</hi> its Names.</note> of <hi>Guien,</hi> and from another Place under the Name of a <hi>Manna-pear,</hi> and under that of the latter <hi>Bergamot:</hi> And indeed this laſt Name would better agree to it, than that of <hi>Colmar;</hi> it has very much of the Air of a <hi>Boncretien,</hi> and ſometimes of a fair <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamot:</hi>

Its Colour is a ſpotted green like the <hi>Bergamet,</hi> and ſometimes a little tinged with red on the ſide next the Sun: It grows a little yellow when it comes to be mellow, which happens in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> and ſometimes reaches as far as <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March:</hi> Its Skin is gentle and ſmooth, its Pulp tender, and its Juice very ſweet and very ſugred; in which you have the Picture of an Excellent <hi>Pear,</hi> but yet it has the ſame ill Offices to fear from the Quality of the Soil, and of the Seaſons with the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> the <hi>Louiſe-bonne</hi> or <hi>Good Louiſe,</hi> the <hi>Petit oin, &amp;c.</hi> being a little ſubject to have its Pulp gritty and inſipid; beſides which, it fears the leaſt blaſts of the <hi>Autumn</hi> Winds, which eſpecially upon <hi>Tall-trees</hi> eaſily blow down its Fruit, and hinder it from acquiring that degree of Perfection which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it ſhould have.

                           <p>I confeſs indeed, That thoſe are very powerful Reproaches, if they were altogether true, and inſeparably affixed to this <hi>Pear;</hi> but we can anſwer, Firſt, That we ſuppoſe in this place the ground to be favourable enough to produce good ones; in the ſecond place we ſay, that the time of its Ripening is commonly about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> and that then the <hi>Butter-Pears</hi> are ordinarily gone and paſt, ſo that in that time, it often makes an agreeable interlude in conſort with the laſt ripe <hi>Peaches,</hi> and particularly with the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcat-Grapes,</hi> in expectation of the Ripening of the <hi>Bergamot</hi> and <hi>Petit-Oin-Pears,</hi> which ought not to be long behind; for otherwiſe, we are reduced to make a ſhift with nothing elſe perhaps, but <hi>Meſſire Johns, Vine-Pear, Lanſacs</hi> and <hi>Rouſſelins,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>On the other ſide, if we pleaſe to do it the Juſtice to conſider the great quantity, the Sweetneſs and Perfume of its Juice, with the delicacy and fineneſs of its Pulp, we cannot but confeſs we have no <hi>Pear</hi> that can diſpute with it in thoſe Qualities; nay, further I dare affirm, that it exceeds moſt other <hi>Pears</hi> in that wonderful abundance of Fruit, which as it were to confound its Enemies, it ordinarily preſents us every year upon our <hi>Garden-Theater.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is very certain, if it be never ſo little helped out with Sugar, as it is a <hi>Pear</hi> without any appearance of any Stony or Earthly Matter, and that has hardly any more skin nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than good <hi>Peaches,</hi> we ſhall find ſo many Reaſons for it, and ſo few againſt it, that in Fine, in ſpite of all Objections, it will make it ſelf be conſidered, as a very important Fruit in the time of its perfect Maturity.</p>

                           <p>And that which is here to be Remarked by all the world (for ordinarily men are not Maſters of ſuch happy Soils) is, That of theſe ſeven ſorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> there are two that are much afraid of a very dry ground, and require one that is moderately Moiſt, and they are the <hi>Craſane,</hi> and the St. <hi>Germain;</hi> but that, as for the other five ſorts, they are of a quite oppoſite Temper, and ſucceed wonderfully well, where the two others miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; and again in their turn, become Objects of our pity, or rather of our Horrour and Averſion, in moiſt Soils, unleſs our induſtry and cultivation be very skillfully applied to correct that defect.</p>
                           <p>You may be pleaſed to take Notice, what for that purpoſe I have practiſed with good <note place="margin">Directions how to accommodate our ground to all ſorts of Trees.</note> ſucceſs enough in the Kings <hi>Kitchin-Garden;</hi> The Scituation of the place which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Marſhy, and the Temper of the Earth which is cold and groſs, put me on upon making many Experiments, as I have ſaid elſewhere; for I was abſolutely minded to have of all thoſe ſorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> that really had any thing of worth to make them deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for that effect, ſtriving particularly to content the palate of the <hi>Maſter</hi> I have the honour to ſerve, I endeavoured to lay in there a proportion of Molds of all ſorts of Conſtitutions, to give thoſe <hi>Pears</hi> the means to attain their due perfection: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I raiſed a part of my ground into double Slopes and Ridges with convenient Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Gutters between, to drain them, and conſequently to dry them from all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Moiſture; and planted upon the moſt Elevated parts of theſe Ridges or Slopes, as well in form of <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Standard-trees,</hi> ſuch ſorts of Fruits that could the leaſt endure humidity, and placed thoſe others that find their Account better in a Scituation not ſo dry, in other parts which I had not raiſed ſo high.</p>
                           <p>The Counſel then that I take the Liberty to give to all curious perſons, is, that, if their little Gardens offend in humidity, and they be minded to correct that Fault in them, they would imitate as far as they can in due proportion, what I have practiſed in a very great one; and on the other ſide, that they who have only a very dry Soil, if they pleaſe to believe me, would plant but few <hi>Craſane,</hi> or St. <hi>Germain-Pear-trees,</hi> unleſs it be upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48210:75"/>
free-ſtocks, for fear otherwiſe, of a little biting ſharpneſs in the firſt, and a little ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſecond (tho both thoſe Taſts are eaſily allayed with a little Sugar, or elſe vaniſh when thoſe Fruits come to their full Ripeneſs) and would rather fix upon the five other ſorts, which will amply recompenſe them for all their pains and care.</p>
                           <p>But thoſe again who have ground that is moderately Moiſt, will do well to give ſome good places to ſome <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of the <hi>Craſane</hi> and St. <hi>Germain-Pears</hi> grafted, either upon free or <hi>Quince-ſtocks,</hi> and at the ſame time, to reject the <hi>Louiſe-Bonns,</hi> or <hi>Good-Louiſe,</hi> the <hi>Petit-Oins,</hi> and the <hi>Marchioneſs-pears,</hi> unleſs they plant Standard Trees of them, or take great care that nothing cover them from the heat of the Sun.</p>
                           <p>The ſhort Eating <hi>Pears,</hi> which were formerly in ſuch great Vogue in all Gardens, are ſo far from ſeeing themſelves in favour at this day, that now no eſteem at all is made neither of the <hi>Meſſire Johns,</hi> nor <hi>Dry-Martins,</hi> nor <hi>Portals,</hi> nor <hi>Beſideries,</hi> and if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon Noble Tables, it is not never to return any more, or to give any pleaſure to the Taſte; but only with deſign at moſt, to help towards a ſolid conſtruction of <hi>Fruit-Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> there uſed for <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Shew.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding all this, theſe kinds of <hi>Pears</hi> are not without ſome Patrons; and therefore as they are ſenſible they have ſtill as much worth as ever they had formerly, they demand to be admitted to have the fair play to ſhew it with the beſt advantage to the world; to endeavour what they can to retrive their credit, and to be ſuffered at leaſt to follow next thoſe fifteen choice preceding <hi>Pears</hi> which have had all the honour of the Firſt Gardens.</p>

It has not in Truth the Gift to pleaſe all the world: For thoſe that like it not find Fault with its ſtonineſs to which it is very Subject, and Objject againſt its rough and groſs Pulp, which by this means it contracts, and that, with but too much Reaſon; yet methinks they laſh out a little too far in their contempt of it; when they ſay, 'tis but a <hi>Pear</hi> for a <hi>Curate,</hi> a <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> or a <hi>Serving-man,</hi> or at moſt, a <hi>Pear</hi> for the <hi>Vulgar people;</hi> but whatſoever they are pleaſed to ſay, they cannot but confeſs however, in its juſtification, that as much as it dreads and abhors Grounds that are too dry, and Summers too burning hot, which make it ſmall and deſpicable; ſo much it deſires and delights in a Soil that is moderately moiſt, either by Nature, or by Art, that is to ſay Moiſt, by the the help of Watering; and ſo accommodated, in a Summer that is pretty mild, it infallibly proſpers ſo as to grow a fair large <hi>Pear,</hi> and of great increaſe, thriving almoſt as well upon a <hi>Free,</hi> as upon a <hi>Quince-ſtock,</hi> and in the Form of a <hi>Standard-tree,</hi> as of a <hi>Dwarf:</hi> The ſhape of this <hi>Pear</hi> is flat, and its Skin is a little rough <note place="margin">The <hi>Meſſire-John</hi> deſcribed.</note> in thoſe that are <hi>Grey,</hi> but in thoſe that are <hi>White,</hi> it is a little gentler, and in a ſhort Eating Pulp, it yields a very ſugred Juice, with a midling quantity of ſtony ſubſtance; and it may even be praiſed for ſo well nicking the time of its Ripening; for that, in fine, to avoid the confuſion it might ſuffer if it ſhould be ſo bold as to intrude into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the tender and <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> to which it will not preſume to compare it ſelf, it ſtays juſt till the <hi>Ruſſelets,</hi> the <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> and the <hi>Verte-longues,</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears</hi> are paſt, and comes in a little before the middle of <hi>October,</hi> as 'twere only to amuſe the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, whilſt the <hi>Marchioneſſos, Louiſe-bonnes,</hi> or <hi>Good Louiſe</hi>'s and <hi>Petit-Oins</hi> are advancing towards their Maturity, and eſpecially whilſt the <hi>Bergamot</hi> is preparing to ſhew her ſelf

with all the ſplendour and agreeableneſs that becomes the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Pears:</hi> If this <hi>Meſſire-John</hi> had any better Reaſons to produce, it would not fail to alledge them with the utmoſt advantage it could; and it deſires we ſhould count it for one Plea in its favour, that it is diſpoſed well enough to form a goodly <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> and that its Fruit makes an Indifferent fine Figure in the <hi>Deſerts</hi> of the <hi>Vacation</hi> Seaſon.</p>
                           <p>It would not be juſt, if after we have ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſire-John,</hi> we ſhould not ſay ſomething too of the <hi>Portal,</hi> which is a <hi>Pear</hi> ſo famous in one of the greateſt Provinces <note place="margin">

It comes alone, and almoſt the firſt of all; it is that which, as I may ſay, opens the Theater of good Fruits; all which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations would be ſtrong enough to gain me in its Favour, but that 'tis too ſmall a <hi>Pear</hi> to take up ſo ſoon ſo great and precious a Place, and eſpecially in the Figure of a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> in which, no more than the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> it ſeldom meets with any ſucceſs: It requires, without doubt, to be planted rather againſt Walls, and accordingly I ſhall take care to place it well in that Situation, when I ſhall come to treat of thoſe Fruits that are to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our Walls.</p>
                           <p>The Great <hi>Blanquet-pear,</hi> which is the true <hi>Musked Blanquet,</hi> and the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam</hi> or <hi>Lady thigh pear,</hi> would have reaſon to be offended, if the <hi>Muſcat</hi> ſhould precede them, at leaſt in the Form of a <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> though doubtleſs, and without Contradiction, they both

                           <p>The <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam</hi> or <hi>Lady thigh,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> its ſhape and colour being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that ſort of <hi>Pear;</hi> its Pulp is between ſhort and tender, accompanied with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different great abundance of Juice, having a ſmall reliſh of Musk, and being very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant when it is full ripe; to which may be added another very favourable reaſon both for this <hi>Pear</hi> and the <hi>Great Blanquet;</hi> which is, that they both come to chear us, whilſt the <hi>Peaches</hi> are a coming; and that they are the firſt <hi>Pears</hi> that are reaſonably large and good, that we have in the Beginning of <hi>July.</hi> Their Plants form very fine <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and the only fault I find in them is, that they are very hard to be brought to bear; but yet from the very firſt Moment they have once begun, they produce to a wonder.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Great Blanquet,</hi> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> is very different from that which is ſimply called the <hi>Blanquet,</hi> or <hi>little Blanquet-pear,</hi> and is more forward in ripening by Fifteen Days; it is bigger and not ſo handſomly ſhaped for a <hi>Pear</hi> as the leſſer one; it colours a little upon a <hi>Dwarf tree,</hi> and has a very ſhort thick ſtack and a little hollow ſet: Its Wood, which is ſmall, and its Leaf, are pretty like thoſe of the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-thigh,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Wood of the <hi>Little Blanquet</hi> is ordinarily very thick and pretty ſhort; the <hi>Great Blanquet</hi> is likewiſe very different from the <hi>Long-tail'd Blanquet,</hi> which is a handſom <hi>Pear,</hi> whoſe Crown is pretty big and ſtanding out; its belly round and pretty long towards the ſtalk, which is a little fleſhy and pretty long, and bending downwards; its Skin very ſmooth, white, and ſometimes a little coloured on the Sunny ſide; its Pulp is between ſhort and tender, very fine, and very full of Juice, which is ſurged and very pleaſant. It has the faults of moſt part of the <hi>Summer-pears,</hi> which are to have ſomething of ſtony or earthy Relicks, and to become doughy when they are let to grow too ripe; this <hi>Pear,</hi> no more than the <hi>Great Blanquet</hi> are not yet very common, though they well deſerve to be ſo: They ſucceed well, whether it be on <hi>Dwarf</hi> or <hi>Standard trees.</hi> I ſhall not be long before I place this <hi>Long-tail'd Blanquet.</hi> The white Colour which appears in the Skin of the three ſorts of <hi>Pears,</hi> has occaſioned their being called <hi>Blanquets</hi> or <hi>Blanched pears,</hi> which is the Name they bear.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Caſſolet</hi> having juſt now ſeen the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam,</hi> and the <hi>Great Blanquet,</hi> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> paſs before it, murmurs in earneſt, becauſe it is not preferr'd before them. It is a longiſh and greyiſh <hi>Pear,</hi> which is hardly inferior to any thing to the <hi>Robine-pear;</hi> neither in its Pulp, nor in its Juice, nor in its whole Excellence taken altogether, ſave only that is apt to grow ſoft, which happens not to the <hi>Robine-pear,</hi> and therefore it might well diſpute theſe two laſt places, if it were as happy as the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-thighs,</hi> and <hi>Blanquets</hi> or <hi>White Musked-pears,</hi> in well timing its Maturity; but it comes not in till about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that is to ſay, with the <hi>Robine,</hi> and near about the beginning of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Peaches,</hi> and in the prime of the Seaſon of <hi>Figs,</hi> and of the beſt <hi>Plums,</hi> which we have by the means of Walls of Incloſure, which is, to come in too good company to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate ſo ſoon in the firſt honours of ſmall Gardens, and therefore I defer the placing of it yet for ſome further time.</p>
                           <p>It is viſible enough, that in this diſtribution of Places, I act as 'twere the part of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> who for the common good, aims particularly to order things ſo, that if in every ſeaſon of the year we cannot have an abundance of good fruits, we may have at leaſt a competent and reaſonable quantity of them in proportion to the extent and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Ground in the Garden every one has, and particularly in proportion to the aſſiſtance which the Wall-trees ſhould contribute for their part, upon which I count, and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that had it not been for ſuch proſpects as theſe, I had already placed the <hi>Caſſolet,</hi> and the <hi>Musked Summer Boncretien, &amp;c.</hi> That which I intend then at preſent, is ſo exactly well to regulate and proportion all good fruits that every one of them in its rank, may have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſatisfie the obligation that ſeems to have been impoſed upon them all, not only to give pleaſure to man, but above all, to contribute to the preſervation of his health.</p>
                           <p>And methinks we have appearance enough to perſwade us, there is ſuch an obligation laid on them: For in effect, is it not viſible, in that Nature furniſhes us more or leſs of fruits according as we are more or leſs attacked by external heat, which would otherwiſe be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to offend us? This is a Sovereign Remedy, and a Refreſhment ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which ſhe preſents us every year in the Critical time of our need: 'Tis for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that is to ſay, in the time of the moſt formidable heats of the <hi>Dog-days,</hi> we have ſuch ſtore of <hi>Musk-melons, Figs, Peaches, Plums,</hi> and even of <hi>Pears</hi> too:</p>

                              <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48210:77"/>
We ſee likewiſe that at the arrival of the rigorous cold, which ordinarily domineers from <hi>Mid-November,</hi> till <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> we all finding our ſelves more ſenſible of the firſt on-ſet of the Froſts, are thereby conſtrained to approach ſo much the nearer the Fire, to defend our ſelves from them.</p>
                           <p>That external foreign heat ſo ſuddenly taken in, might without doubt ſo immoderately augment that which we have from Nature, that great Infirmities might from thence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us. But that this good Mother out of her ordinary Wiſdom ſeems to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt them, by giving us preciſely for that time, an admirable Quantity of tender Fruits, that is to ſay, of <hi>Bergamot-pears, Petit-oins, Craſannes, Louiſe-bonnes</hi> or <hi>Good-Louiſes, Leſchaſſeries, Ambrets, Virgoulees, Thorn-pears, St. Germains, Colmars, St. Auguſtins,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing with them even ſome of thoſe ſhort-eating and musked <hi>Pears,</hi> which are no bad Fruit, of which I have above ſpoken, as <hi>Amadots, Great Musk-pears, Dry Martins</hi> and <hi>Portals,</hi> beſides all the <hi>Apples,</hi> as <hi>Calvilles, Pepins, Fenouillets</hi> or <hi>Fennel-apples, Cour-pendu's</hi> or <hi>Short-ſtalk'd Apples, &amp;c.</hi> And we ſee the number of theſe divine Antidotes diminiſhes gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as we ceaſe to have ſo great a neceſſity for them; that is, I mean as the great Cold approaches, which, if I may be ſo bold to ſay it, appears to me, to be the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankind, and which particularly at the time that I am labouring moſt for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I treat of, moſt Torments and Afflicts me.</p>
                           <p>'Tis not my part, nor yet is this a proper place to declaim here againſt this Cold; but if any advantage might redound to us by ſo doing, without doubt conſidering that it equally incommodes me every where, where-ever I meet with it, whether in my Body or my ſlender wit, or whether more particularly in our Gardens, and, above all, in regard of our Novelties. There ſhould be nothing that I would not ſay or do, to baniſh a good part of it out of our Climates: For, humanly ſpeaking, I have no kindneſs at all for the Cold, unleſs it be for ſome Icicles and a little Snow, which are the Relicks we have of it in its abſence, and which we take great care to ſhut up in the cloſe Priſons of our Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; they being as it ſeems a ſort of Criminals which have need of the Correction of a long Impriſonment, before they can be brought to a temper to be made ſerviceable for any good; And, in effect, there is a time when the Remains of thoſe Perſecutors of Men and Gardens, approve themſelves to be very uſeful; for, in fine, during the troubleſom heats of <hi>Summer,</hi> they bear the moſt delicious part in the Drink of Noble Perſons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, would to God, that without experimenting the Rigor of the <hi>Winters</hi> our ſelves, we could have Ice brought to us from the <hi>North,</hi> as we have <hi>Olives, Oranges,</hi> and ſo many other good Things from hot Countries.</p>
                           <p>I proceed all along according to the Deſign I propoſed to my ſelf, which is to contrive, as near as 'tis poſſible, that we may have in every Garden at leaſt ſome one kind of good Fruit of every Seaſon, and that from the Moment we begin to have any, there may be no diſcontinuation or interval till the return of Fruits again the next Year. We have the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-thigh,</hi> about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> we may join to it for the One and Twentieth place, the <hi>Musked Bourdon,</hi> or rather the <hi>Muſcat Robert,</hi> which makes the more agreeable <hi>Dwarf-tree</hi> of the two.</p>

This <hi>Muſcat-Robert</hi> furniſhes us almoſt till the time of the coming in of the <hi>Musked Boncretien,</hi> which is about the End of the Month; it is a very handſom Pear, having a pretty tender Pulp, and very much ſugred: It is about the bigneſs of a <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi>

                           <p>The Two and Twentieth place would not be very ill filled up by the <hi>Vine-pear,</hi> or <note place="margin">The <hi>Vine-pear,</hi> its Names. Its Deſcription.</note>

but rather makes a particular <hi>Claſs</hi> by it ſelf, which conſiſts in a kind of fattiſh and glewy Pulp, and often doughy; over and above which, its merit is infinitely obſcured by meeting with the <hi>Butter-pears, Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears, Bergamots, Sugar-greens, Petit-oins, Lanſacs, Marchioneſſes, Craſannes,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>I ſhould never have done, and, contrary to my Intention, I ſhould tire all the World if I ſhould ſtand ſo long a deciding the Conteſtations of the other Pears that are in uſe in <hi>Fruit-Gardens,</hi> as I have done upon the occaſion of the Four and twenty preceding ones: They which ſtill remain behind are of no ſuch great Merit, to induce me to make a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Panegyrick of them, nor particularly to expreſs the Reaſons they may have to diſpute with their Companions. And I do not think it neceſſary, as I think I have told you elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for a well-contrived Garden, to have at leaſt one Tree of every one of thoſe ſorts that are but reaſonably good; but my Judgment is, there ſhould be rather ſo many the more Trees of thoſe that are aſſuredly Excellent. I know well enough, That we have more ſorts of pretty good <hi>Pears,</hi> than I have here placed; and accordingly as the Gardens I treat of, ſhall grow more ſpacious, I will not fail to place them ſome in other kinds.</p>
                           <p>However, at leaſt, thus far I may ſay, that without having in our little Gardens, one only bad ſort of <hi>Pears,</hi> we can boaſt that there are to be found One and twenty of the beſt ſorts that are known, though there be in all but Four and Twenty <hi>Dwarf pear-trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I ſpeak not yet of thoſe which are to be planted againſt Walls. And I have ſet down the Order of the Ripening and Mellowing of theſe Fruits, not only by ſpecifying the Seaſons, but alſo by particulariſing every Month of thoſe Seaſons. There are Six Trees for the <hi>Summer,</hi> which are, one <hi>Cuiſſe-Madam</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thigh,</hi> one Great <hi>Musked Blanquet</hi> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> one <hi>Muſcat Robert,</hi> one <hi>Skinleſs-pear,</hi> one <hi>Robine,</hi> and one <hi>Ruſſelet</hi> or <hi>Ruſſetin;</hi> Nine for the <hi>Autumn,</hi> in ſeven kinds, which are, two <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears,</hi> two <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> one <hi>Craſanne,</hi> one <hi>Meſſire-John,</hi> one <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> one <hi>Louiſe-bonne</hi> or <hi>Good Louiſe,</hi> and one <hi>Petit-oin:</hi> And Nine for <hi>Winter,</hi> in Eight Kinds. This <hi>Winter Seaſon,</hi> beſides a part of the <hi>Autumnal-pears,</hi> of which it has often the Advantage to make its Profit, glories very much in having one <hi>Winter Thorn-pear,</hi> one St. <hi>Germain,</hi> one <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> one <hi>Leſchaſſerie,</hi> one <hi>Ambret,</hi> one <hi>Colmar,</hi> one St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and two <hi>Boncretien-trees,</hi> being all <hi>Pears</hi> of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity much further extended than that of the other Seaſons; which if they be not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per excellent, yet we ought to comfort our ſelves and be content, ſince, among all the great number the Earth brings forth to us, and that are come to our Knowledge, we have no better than thoſe which we have choſen.</p>
                           <p>I pretend to redouble the <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of our principal <hi>Pears,</hi> at leaſt Four or Five times over, before I multiply the others, and before I proceed to place a ſcore of thoſe which we have mentioned in paſſing. I ſee well enough they are extreamly eager to produce themſelves; but yet, methinke, whatever Merit they may have, and which I diſpute
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48210:78"/>
them not, at leaſt upon the Foot it is on, I ſay, I think I may affirm in regard to them, that all of them together durſt not preſume to enter into Conteſtation againſt any of thoſe principal ſorts, though they ſhould take them one by one.</p>
                           <p>And therefore I muſt counſel them, to have patience yet for ſome time, ſince, in my Opinion, their Condition will not be over-unhappy if they be admitted to appear each of them once in great Gardens, after they have firſt ſeen Four or Five of the moſt Honourable Places given to every one of them which are already actually eſtabliſh'd, and which, if I may be permitted ſo to ſpeak, are among our Fruits that which thoſe called the <hi>Keys</hi> in a Pack of Hounds are in Hunting.</p>
                           <p>This being ſetled, and we now beginning to enter into Gardens that are indifferent large, my Judgment is, That, to plant them Skilfully, we ought, firſt, to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of a particular Canton or Plat of Ground for the Fruits of each Seaſon, that ſo they may not be confuſedly mix'd poll-moll one among the other, but that the <hi>Summer-</hi>Fruits may be in a place apart by themſelves, and thoſe of <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> in like manner by themſelves; for want of which Regulation, there happens ſeveral Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which I elſewhere ſhall lay open; and ſecondly, to aſſign every Tree its Place in the following Order, and conſequently to give,</p>

                              <hi>Pear</hi> is Excellent, and makes a very fine Tree; it is of a very agreeable Shape to look upon, being well made in its <hi>Pear,</hi> which is of a reaſonable bigneſs, near about that of the fair <hi>Bergamots:</hi> Its Colour is white on the one ſide, and red on the other; its Pulp is between ſhort and tender, having a great deal of Juice accompanied with an agreeable Perfume; its unhappineſs is, That it comes in at the ſame time with the <hi>Robins-pear,</hi> by which it is always eclipſed, and with the good <hi>Peaches</hi> of the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which hardly ſuffer any <hi>Pears</hi> in their Company; but however, I thing it worthy to enter at leaſt once into a Garden of Threeſcore and fifteen Trees.</p>
                           <p>As for the <hi>Orange-green-pear,</hi> it has a conſiderable great number of ſmall Friends: All the World knows it by its Name, and, in effect, it is a common and popular Pear, and which, in the time of our Fathers, made a pretty great Figure in Gardens; ſo that among all old Trees, we fail not to find a great many of this ſort. I do not believe any Body will go about to chaſe it out of the Place which I have given it. The time of its ripening, which <note place="margin">

                           <p>I had one Year ſome of them that proved ſo good, that I was almoſt ready to believe them of a particular Kind, but I never could ſee the like ſince: It has in all ſorts of Soils the advantage of being very Fruitful, which procures it among many of the midling

ſort of Gardeners, a very particular Eſteem; and it has beſides another advantage of being Beautiful, which, during the Month of <hi>October,</hi> gives it a place in all the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> ſerved up at great Tables. It meets with a good many curious Perſons that much more value it than I do; but I cannot tell how to help it, and they muſt pardon me if I tell them, that I am almoſt aſhamed I have ſo well placed it. We have ſince this little while a new <hi>Pear</hi> under the name of <hi>Beſi de la Motte,</hi> which pretty near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <note place="margin">Beſi de la Motte, <hi>a new</hi> Pear <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</hi>

                           <p>Though thus far, in ſome of theſe firſt Gardens, and, for Example, in that of Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and fifteen <hi>Pear-trees.</hi> The number of ſome Kinds for <hi>Autumn,</hi> be very great in proportion to thoſe for <hi>Winter;</hi> for there are Twenty ſeven Trees of the firſt Sorts, and but Thirty ſeven of the other, yet I ſhould not be againſt any ones changing a little that Regulation, by retrenching a part even of the <hi>Summer-pears,</hi> which are to the number of Twelve, to multiply in their place, ſuch kinds of other Seaſons as ſhould moſt pleaſe him.</p>
                           <p>And, for that reaſon, I ſhould think my ſelf much to blame, if when we ſhall all be Planting of great Gardens, I ſhould counſel all the World to place there for Example, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears,</hi> or even of <hi>Butter-pears</hi> too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretiens, Ambrets, Virgoulees, Leſchaſſeries, Thorn-pears, De la Fares, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, and I am aſſured, the great Lovers of thoſe good <hi>Pears</hi> of <hi>Autumn,</hi> would not diſapprove this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; I will ſometimes multiply them, and ſometimes alſo thoſe of the Second and Third <hi>Claſs,</hi> but it ſhall be always with this Conſideration, which ought to ſerve for a Rule to every Gard'ner, and which I propoſe to my ſelf as a Direction for every other Perſon in particular, that is to ſay, that regularly we ſhould not ſtrive to have more of each ſort of Fruits, than juſt about what we may probably ſpend either our ſelves, or in our own Families, or in Entertainment of Freinds, without giving thoſe Fruits the time miſerably to rot and ſpoil: Nay, I believe that thoſe <hi>Pears</hi> which have not the good Fortune to laſt long, and which, as well as we, have reaſon to envy that advantage to ſo many bad ſorts, which without any care, and as 'twere in ſpite of us, keep eaſily till the coming in of the next <hi>Summer-fruits;</hi> I believe, I ſay, that thoſe good <hi>Pears</hi> would think themſelves offended, if we ſhould multiply them in ſuch a manner, that inſtead of being all of them employed whilſt in their perfect Maturity, in performing their Duty to Mankind, a great part of them ſhould ſee themſelves inſenſibly become unſerviceable, by being over-run with Rottenneſs.</p>
                           <p>For when we have but a little quantity of each ſort of Fruit, it ſeldom happens we let them be ſpoiled; no, we viſit them too often to give them time for that: Whereas, when we have a great abundance of them, nothing is ſo ordinary as to ſee a good part of them ſpoiled. And therefore in this point we ought judiciouſly to determine what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity we ſhall, as near as can be computed, need to have of them according to our Deſigns; and according to that Foot, to proportion, as I have ſaid before, the number of Trees of each kind, which we are to Plant in our Garden.</p>
                           <p>There are ſome of theſe Trees that are long before they come to bear, as the <hi>Ambret,</hi> the <hi>Robine,</hi> the <hi>Bourdon,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſelet,</hi> the <hi>Thorn-pear,</hi> and above all the reſt, the <hi>Virgoulee,</hi> the <hi>Colmar, &amp;c.</hi> And there are ſome that are quick enough in producing, provided they be graffed on <hi>Quince-ſtocks,</hi> as the <hi>Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears,</hi> the <hi>Butter-pear,</hi> the <hi>Doyennee</hi> or <hi>Dean-pear, &amp;c.</hi> But theſe laſt bear ſuch Fruits, that it is convenient to have a pretty good number of them, becauſe we eat a great many of them in their Seaſon, they coming in while the Weather is yet hot, and in a time in which we are not uſed to be contented with half a <hi>Pear;</hi> for, in earneſt, a Man muſt eat a great many <hi>Ruſſelets, Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears, Butter-pears, Doyennee</hi> or <hi>Dean-pears, &amp;c.</hi> before he can ſatisfie his Appetite; and Nature, that is as well acquainted with our Paſſions as our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and which intended equally to accommodate the one as well as the other, has, as we may ſay, given to theſe latter ſorts of <hi>Pears</hi> the Gift of Fruitfulneſs, as well as that of Quickneſs in Bearing, with deſign, that in their Seaſon we might have a ſufficient Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, ſince we are in a Condition to ſpend them both with Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                           <p>It ought not then to be wondred at, if ſo far as in thoſe Sizes of Gardens that can hold but about Seventy five Trees, I deſire there ſhould be almoſt as many Trees of thoſe Fruits that ripen, as 'twere, altogether, as of ſome of thoſe that ripen ſucceſſively one after
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48210:80"/>
another, and which by conſequence, give us the time to make a commodious and regular Conſumption of them; for, as I have ſaid, when I come to treat of larger Plantations, I ſhall doubtleſs uſe much more moderation in regard to thoſe Fruits which keep but a little while, than to thoſe others that having the advantage of being good, as well as laſting, will keep for ſeveral Months together.</p>
                           <p>However I leave it to every curious Perſon, to multiply the Fruits of one Seaſon more than thoſe of another, according to his own Inclination or Occaſions. For ſuch a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for Example, upon the conſideration that he is to paſs ſuch and ſuch certain times in the Country, where he is frequently to entertain Company, muſt neceſſarily have more Fruits of the Months of <hi>September, October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> than of the other Seaſons, and in ſuch a Caſe, the number of the <hi>Ruſſelets, Verte-longues</hi> or <hi>Long-green-pears, Butter-pears, Doyennces</hi> or <hi>Dean-pears, Bergamots, Marchioneſſes, Lanſacs, Craſannes, Vine-pears, Petit-oins, Louiſe-bonnes</hi> or <hi>Good-Louiſes, Beſi de la Mottes,</hi> and even of <hi>Meſſire-Johns, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be augmented, and the kinds proportionably diminiſhed. And for another Gentleman, on the contrary, for other good Reaſons, as for Example, becauſe he cannot go into the Country to ſpend the <hi>Summer-</hi>Fruits, nor can have them brought him from thence, it is abſolutely expedient to have only good ſtore of <hi>Winter-</hi>Fruits: It will be moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment largely to multiply the <hi>Virgoulees, Winter-Boncretiens, Thorn-pears, Ambrets, Leſchaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Colmars, La Fares, St. Auguſtins, Dry Martins, Paſtourelles, &amp;c.</hi> and to reduce the Fruits of the other Seaſons to a ſmaller Number.</p>
                           <p>It is very certain, that my true Deſign in this Treatiſe of the Choice and Proportion of Fruits, was without any regard to ſuch particular Circumſtances as theſe, which may be infinite, whether in reſpect of every Head of a particular <hi>Family,</hi> or in regard of ſuch as are Heads of <hi>Communities,</hi> and indeed it was impoſſible it ſhould provide for them: No, it was chiefly intended only for the Curious in general, who deſire to have regularly and equally all the year long, as great ſtore as can be of the choiceſt Fruits out of their Gardens, of what bigneſs ſoever they be: And as for the reſt of the Curious, they may from the Knowledge I here have communicated of the good Fruits of every Seaſon, and of the laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each kind of them, gather ſufficient Directions to aſſiſt them in making ſuch deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations thereupon, which ſhall be moſt conformable to their Intentions.</p>
                           <p>To continue then at preſent, what I have begun for the firſt ſort of curious Perſons, I think, we ought to give.</p>

The <hi>Bourdon,</hi> or <hi>Humble-Bee-pear,</hi> is a <hi>Pear</hi> of the end of <hi>July,</hi> which for its Bigneſs, <note place="margin">The <hi>Bourdon,</hi> or <hi>Humble-Bee-Pear</hi> Deſcribed.</note> quality of its Pulp, its Taſte, its Perfume, and its Juice, as well as for the time of its Ripening, very much reſembles the <hi>Muſcat-Robert,</hi> and is little different from it in its Stalk, which is longer in this than in that.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Eſpargne,</hi> or <hi>Reſerve-pear,</hi> otherwiſe, the St. <hi>Sanſon,</hi> is a <hi>Red Pear,</hi> indifferent big, <note place="margin">The <hi>Eſpargne,</hi> or <hi>Reſerve-Pear</hi> Deſcribed.</note> and very large, and as one may ſay, a little vaulted in its ſhape: It has a tender Pulp, a little ſowriſh, and ripens about the end of <hi>July:</hi> Of this <hi>Pear,</hi> one may ſay without any deſign to offend it, that it has more beauty than goodneſs, and accordingly, it triumphs more in the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> than in the <hi>Mouth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Maudlin-pear</hi> is a <hi>Pear</hi> that is greeniſh and pretty tender, and approaching very <note place="margin">The <hi>Maudlin-Pear</hi> Deſcribed.</note> near in ſhape to the <hi>Bergamot:</hi> It ripens at the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and ſo is one of the firſt <hi>Pears</hi> of the <hi>Summer;</hi> but it is very apt to deceive us, if we ſtay till it begins to grow Yellow before we gather it, becauſe then it is paſt its goodneſs, and is grown Doughy.</p>
                           <p>The Compounded Name the <hi>Sugar-green-pear</hi> bears, deſcribes to us at the ſame time both its Juice and its Colour: If it were a little bigger, it might be taken for a <hi>Winter-Thorn-pear,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">The <hi>Sugar-green-Pear</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> it ſo much reſembles it in ſhape; it ripens towards the end of <hi>October,</hi> its Pulp is very Buttery, its Juice Sugared, and its Taſte agreeable, having hardly any other fault, than that of being a little ſtrong towards the Core.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Bugi,</hi> to which is regularly given the Sir-name of <hi>Bergamot,</hi> and of <hi>Eaſter-Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> becauſe in its green Colour, and in its Bigneſs, it has ſome Air of the good <hi>Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>

                              <hi>Bergamot,</hi> yet being a little leſs flat towards the Eye or Crown, and a little longer towards the Stalk; the <hi>Bugi,</hi> I ſay, is a <hi>Pear</hi> ſpeckled with little grey ſpecks, which grows a little yellowiſh in ripening, whoſe Pulp participates at the ſame time of tenderneſs and firmneſs, and as one may ſay, eats almoſt ſhort; it has the misfortune ſometimes to grow Doughy and Mealy, which happens when 'tis ſuffered to grow too ripe before it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: Its Juice which is in abundance enough, has I know not what ſmack of ſowreneſs, which often makes it be comtemned and rejected, but a little Sugar ſerves it for a great remedy; and in truth, having the advantage to ſtay to Mellow in <hi>Lent,</hi> when it makes a good figure, appearing then almoſt alone in the great ſterility of Fruits, it merits at leaſt the place I have given it, nay, and the curious Perſon, in whoſe Grounds it uſually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds well, may very well place it better than I have done.</p>

                           <p>In this laſt Number of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> I have newly placed, there are five, of which I have yet made no Deſcription, namely the <hi>Double Flower,</hi> the <hi>Franc Real,</hi> or <hi>Frank Royal,</hi> the <hi>Angober,</hi> the <hi>Beſidery,</hi> and the <hi>Great Onionet,</hi> or <hi>Onion Pear:</hi> Therefore to ſatisfie the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of them that have a mind to know what I think of them,</p>

                              <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48210:81"/>
I ſhall tell them, that I make a very particular account of the <hi>Double Flower,</hi> or <hi>Double</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">The <hi>Double-Flower,</hi> or <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Flower'd-Pear</hi> Deſcribed.</note> 
                              <hi>Flowr'd Pear,</hi> not to Eat Raw, though ſome certain Perſons like it well enough ſo too, finding that in it, which I do not, that is, ſomething pleaſant in its Pulp, and in its Taſte; But I eſteem it firſt, becauſe it is altogether beautiful to look upon, it being really a large ſlat <hi>Pear</hi> with a long ſtrait ſtalk, a ſmooth skin, Bluſh-coloured on one ſide, and Yellow on the other; in the ſecond place, there being no ſrcuple made in letting it appear in great Diſhes of Fruit; I priſe it for the ſervice it renders on ſuch occaſions: And laſtly, becauſe after it has made an agreeable figure for ſeveral days together, and that by often handling, it begins to looſe the Flower of its lovely Colour, and to grow quite dull and blackiſh, it then remains in a condition to ſignalize its true Excellency; for it is moſt uſeful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably employed in making one of the lovelieſt and beſt <hi>Compot's,</hi> or Wet Sweet-meats in the World, having a Marrowy Pulp, without being incommoded with the leaſt ſtonineſs, and having above all, abundance of Juice, that eaſily takes a beautiful Colour over the Fire; ſo that, in my judgment, and according to my Palate, all that together affords me great Reaſons to eſteem this <hi>Pear,</hi> though I ſhould only conſider it as particularly good to Preſerve, or otherwiſe prepare by Fire.</p>
                           <p>It is likewiſe well known, that the <hi>Franc-Real,</hi> or <hi>Frank-Royal,</hi> which ſome name, the <note place="margin">The <hi>Frank-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pear</hi> Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note>

                           <p>The <hi>Angober</hi> is alſo known to be a pretty big long <hi>Pear,</hi> Bluſh-coloured on one ſide, <note place="margin">The <hi>Angober-Pear</hi> Deſcribed.</note> and of a Greyiſh Ruſſet on the other; the Wood of its Tree is very much like that of the <hi>Butter-Pear</hi> and the <hi>Pear</hi> is not much unlike that.</p>
                           <p>It is likewiſe no leſs known, that the <hi>Beſidery</hi> is a pretty round <hi>Pear,</hi> about the bigneſs <note place="margin">The <hi>Beſidery-Pear</hi> Deſcribed.</note> of a large <hi>Tennis-Ball,</hi> of a Yellowiſh and Whitiſh Green-colour, with an indifferent ſtrait and long ſtalk, and Ripening in <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November.</hi>

                           <p>I cannot here forbear expreſſing ſome Regret, that among ſo many <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> I find ſo few <hi>Boncretiens,</hi> and no <hi>Autumnal Bergamots;</hi> I have already declared the Reaſons I had for that, which were the hopes we had to have a pretty good number of <hi>Wall-trees</hi> of both of them; and becauſe thoſe Grounds that are ſubject to be Cold and Moiſt, are altogether fatal to them. But if our Ground be reaſonably dry, becauſe we have a very great Inconvenience to fear from the <hi>Tyger-Babs,</hi> a curſed little volatile Inſect that horridly deſtroys the <hi>Wall-pears,</hi> and hinders us from planting many of them, eſpecially in the good Expoſitions of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> I ſay therefore, if our Ground has not that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of being too Cold and Moiſt, it will be convenient enough to Plant in it a good number of <hi>Boncretion Dwarf-trees.</hi>

It is a great thick long <hi>Pear,</hi> and handſomly made into a Pyramidal Form, reſembling altogether in that, a very Beautiful <hi>Winter Boncretien,</hi> from whence proceeded the fineſt Name it bears; it is on one ſide paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a lovely bright red, all ſpeckled with little black ſpecks, on the other ſide it is of a whitiſh Yellow. Its Pulp eats the ſhorteſt of all the <hi>Pears</hi> I know: It has ordinarily a ſweet ſugred and indifferent good Juice, when it grows in good Ground, and comes to its perfect mellowneſs, which happens commonly from mid-<hi>November</hi> to the <hi>middle</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and ſometimes laſts till <hi>January.</hi> It was for all thoſe qualities, that for two or three Years together, I had conceived a great Eſteem for it; but, beſides, that in that very ſame Seaſon, we have all our principal tender and melting <hi>Pears,</hi> I have for more than Twenty Years, always found its Pulp ſo harſh and groſs, and ſo ſtony, and particularly in Years or Grounds that are a little moiſt, that at laſt, in ſpite of my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, I was forced to reſolve to deny it Entrance into many Gardens; and ſo I am of Opinion, that we ought to be content to ſuffer at leaſt ſome Trees of it in thoſe Gardens where the number of <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> exceeds two Hundred and Fifty, and where the Soil is indifferent good: It having always this Advantage, That it contributes much with its good Meen and lovely Appearance, to the adorning of <hi>Fruit-Pyramids.</hi>

                           <p>The <hi>Salviati</hi> altogether reſembles a <hi>Beſidery</hi> in its Shape, but not in Colour: It is a pretty <note place="margin">The <hi>Salviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> deſcribed.</note> big round <hi>Pear,</hi> with a pretty long and ſmall Stalk ſet in a little hollow, with an Eye or Crown alſo a little hollow and ſmall; it is of a yellow ruſſet-whitiſh Colour; thoſe that have great red ſtreaks, have a pretty rough Skin, but thoſe who are without that red are ſoft-skin'd enough: Its Pulp is tender, but not very fine; its Juice is ſugred and perfumed, coming nearer in Taſte to that of the <hi>Robine,</hi> than of the <hi>Orange-pear:</hi> But this Juice is but in little quantity; the <hi>Pear</hi> is pretty good, and would be ſtill better received, if it came not in with the <hi>Peaches</hi> of the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and of the Beginning of <hi>September.</hi>

And here methinks, I ſee a great many diſcontented Perſons murmuring at my choice: And they are the Lovers of certain kinds of <hi>Pears,</hi> of which I have not yet ſpoken, which are, the <hi>Cat-burnt-pear,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh-pear,</hi> the <hi>Winter Lemon-pear,</hi> the <hi>Winter Ruſſelet,</hi> the <hi>Brutte bonne,</hi> or <hi>Chew-good,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, and there are ſome among them that love the <hi>Roſe-pear,</hi> the <hi>Caillot Roſat,</hi> or <hi>Roſie-pebble,</hi> the <hi>Tulipt Orange-pear,</hi> the <hi>Villain-pear</hi> of <hi>Anjou, &amp;c.</hi> and who yet durſt hardly ſpeak their Minds. Both the one and the other ſort of Gentlemen have fought for theſe <hi>Pears</hi> in the Gardens I have been juſt now modelling, and not finding them there, every one of them in particular has, as 'twere taken offence at it, and at the ſame time would fain make me paſs for a Man that does not know all the good Fruits yet, or at leaſt for one that is led away by prejudice.</p>
                           <p>To which I anſwer, That I am willing theſe Gentlemen ſhould every one of them be free to think <hi>thoſe Pears</hi> they ſpeak of good enough to plant in their Gardens, and in that caſe I willingly conſent they ſhould continue to praiſe them, to multiply them, and employ as much Rhetorick in their Praiſes as they pleaſe: Let them only do me that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remember what I ſaid at the beginning of this Treatiſe concerning the Diverſity of Palats, of Soils and of Years, and to be pleaſed to permit me to tell them in my Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That what made me Reject thoſe Fruits about which they are ſcandalized, was certainly nothing elſe but becauſe for Twenty Years together, I had found them conſtantly rather bad than good, in ſpite of all the Induſtry I had uſe in their Cultivation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becauſe they may happen to meet with certain Circumſtances very favourable to that Merit they ſometimes have, I ſhall now, at laſt, in our great Gardens, do them that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice I think due to them.</p>

might well be taken for one indeed, eſpecially when it is round enough: Its Pulp is very hard and ſtony, and full of earthy matter, and we cannot ſay its excellency conſiſts in that; but it has a good deal of Juice, which is extreamly Musked, and it is that, that has procured it ſome friends for the Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February.</hi>

                           <p>Add to this, That I ſeldom fail in Plantations that are any thing conſiderable, to plant ſome <hi>Standard-trees</hi> of the principal of thoſe Sorts in Symetry, as being an aſſured means to have from them much better Fruit, and in greater plenty too.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond place, in reſpect of the <hi>Autumnal</hi> Fruits, I have at leaſt the ſame regard for them, as for thoſe which I have juſt now ſpoke of; and I look upon the <hi>Bergamot</hi> with the ſame conſideration I have always expreſſed for it, yet I have planted but one or two <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of it in the number of Five hundred, though it be one of the Fruits for the abundance of which, I leaſt pretend to forget to provide: But as all the World knows, 'tis hardly poſſible to have any competent quantity of theſe <hi>Pears,</hi> unleſs it be againſt Walls.</p>

begun as ſoon as ever we found our ſelves in a condition to do that Honour to this <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Pears,</hi> I therefore return now from that Digreſſion, to tell you, that in every Hundreds increaſe of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> the number of thoſe that furniſh the Fruits for the <hi>Autumnal</hi> Seaſon, muſt not be augmented above a ſeventh or eighth part, becauſe of the ſmall duration of moſt of them, and their too great aptneſs to corrupt and rot. But that yet on the other ſide, the pleaſure we take then in devouring a great many of them, and the Seaſon which draws great Companies together, and engages People to make ſome Abode in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are always as a kind of Mariners Compaſs, which ought to guide us in the model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and perfecting our Plantations, and direct us accordingly to Plant a greater or leſſer number of Trees.</p>
                           <p>There remains now then the <hi>Winter</hi> Fruits, which every where are to make up the main Body of Reſerve; ſo that in every Hundred of <hi>Dwarf trees,</hi> they ordinarily ſhould aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about three Quarters of the four. And if my advices have the gift to pleaſe you, pray let care be taken to multiply thoſe Sorts leaſt, which I multiply here as 'twere blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and at a venture.</p>
                           <p>And now, without engaging my ſelf to draw out a plot at length of Six hundred <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> ſuch a one as I have done above for the preceding Five Centuries, that is, to ſet down exactly, and one after another, every kind of Fruit, and every ſingle Tree-ſtock, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order in which every one of them in particular ought to be admitted into the Garden. I ſhall content my ſelf only to tell you at once, That beſides the Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred already regulated, I will add to make up the ſixth hundred, about Ten <hi>Summer Pear-trees,</hi> Eighteen <hi>Autumnal,</hi> and Threeſcore and twelve <hi>Winter</hi> ones.</p>
                           <p>I do not at all wonder, if they who have great Plantations to make, find themſelves puſled about the choice of the number of their Trees; for, I believe, they would be much more perplexed, if they were put to cultivate every particular themſelves, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off that trouble to their Gardeners, as moſt of them unluckily enough do. And I confeſs in good truth, that 'tis a matter that appears to me like an Abyſs of an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable Depth; and that I find an unſpeakable difficulty in it, when I go about to mark out the Quantities as 'twere with a Compaſs, in order to regulate the ſeveral kinds of Fruits by exact proportions.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe great <hi>Plantations</hi> ſtrike me with Terrour, how much accuſtomed ſoever I may be to them; nay, and I believe 'tis becauſe I am accuſtomed to them, that I have ſo clear a Proſpect of the Hazards and Inconveniences with which they circumvent Men, and from thence too it is, that I have ſo often before my Eyes, and in my Mouth, and at the point of my Pen. <hi>Laudato ingentia rura, exiguum Colito.</hi>

If it happens, as doubtleſs it does, that we come at laſt to compaſs within a little, what we propoſed to our ſelves, I am ſure, that after all, we are ſtill at leaſt at as much loſs as ever, what to do with our Fruits.</p>
                           <p>It would be now quickly time for me to begin to plant a few Trees of thoſe Fruits, that are at leaſt fit to conttibute to the Ornament of the Pyramids; and I think nothing can be ſaid againſt it, when once we are come to planting of Six or Seven hundred <hi>Dwarf-trees</hi> of other ſorts: And therefore now we may conveniently enough place among them ſome <hi>Summer Boncretiens,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Graccioli,</hi> ſome <hi>Pears</hi> called <hi>Supremes,</hi> ſome <hi>Admiral Pears,</hi> ſome <hi>Summer Mouille-Bouches,</hi> or <hi>Moiſten-mouths,</hi> ſome <hi>Belliſſimes,</hi> or Super-fair <hi>Pears,</hi> ſome <hi>De bouge Pears,</hi> ſome <hi>Grillands,</hi> ſome <hi>Gilogiles, &amp;c.</hi> I do but only name them here in paſſing, that our curious Gentlemen that know them by their Names, mny plant ſome Trees of them, if they pleaſe, for as for my ſelf, ſo long as I ſhall follow my own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I ſhall hardly plant any of them.</p>
                           <p>Therefore to proceed, as I have begun, I adviſe that the Ten <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to be added to make up Six hundred Trees, be</p>

                           <p>The <hi>Roſe Pear</hi> is indifferent large, flat and round; its ſtalk is very long and ſmall, and its pulp eats ſhort.</p>

                           <p>Of Standard <hi>Pear-trees</hi> to Plant.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THere is nothing near ſo much Reaſon to oblige me to make ſo nice a Diſcuſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout placing <hi>Standard Pear-trees,</hi> as I was about diſpoſing of the <hi>Dwarf Pear-trees:</hi> for they do not all accommodate little Gardens, as theſe latter do; the Shade of great Trees being deſtructive to every thing elſe we might plant there. Add to that, that all the World are particularly deſirous to have air round about their Houſes, and none care to ſuffer any thing near them that may hinder its free acceſſion; and that's one of the principal Reaſons which makes every one deſire at leaſt little Gardens, when they cannot have great ones.</p>
                        <p>We will therefore plant no <hi>Standard</hi> Trees any where but in great Gardens, and there too we will plant but a ſmall number, which ordinarily amounts not to above one Tree for every Square in a Kitching Garden. I have uſed my ſelf to two ſeveral Methods in this Matter, which ſucceed not amiſs, one is to plant them all along the ſides of thoſe great Alleys or Walks that croſs the Garden, and always at a good diſtance from any Walls, excepting thoſe of the <hi>North;</hi> and the other is, to place them in the midſt of the Squares, that is to ſay, one in every Square.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:48210:88"/>
In the firſt manner particularly, becauſe the greateſt part of their ſhadow falls common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Walks, none of the Trees can do any harm to the little Plants growing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, nor to the good Wall Trees which are far enough off of them: And in the ſecond manner, there is nothing to intercept or cloud the ſight, becauſe the Squares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ordinarily at leaſt Threeſcore, or Threeſcore and twelve Foot every way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from one another by ſome Alleys or Walks, the Standard Trees in them will be at a very conſiderable diſtance one from another, and the number of thoſe Squares being not very great, the number of the Standard Trees in them can be but moderate neither, there being very few Kitchen-Gardens ſo proportioned, and ſo deſigned out, as we have expreſſed, that can have above Thirty ſuch Trees.</p>
                        <p>Now for this purpoſe, I either chuſe Trees of thoſe ſorts of Fruits which are not very big, and yet are of great increaſe, and are good when they fall, that is to ſay, of ſome <hi>Summer</hi> Fruits, becauſe their ſmallneſs preſerves them from bruiſing, and their ripeneſs which looſens them from the Tree, makes them fit to be eaten preſently with pleaſure, when any of them happen to be battered in falling.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe I chuſe thoſe kinds which hold faſt by their Stalks, and ſuch whoſe Fruits are very hard in themſelves, as are the ſmall <hi>Winter</hi> Fruits and <hi>Baking-pears;</hi> ſo that they are not eaſily ſhaken down by Winds, nor when they fall ſo apt to be much endamaged thereby.</p>
                        <p>Among the <hi>Summer-Fruits</hi> proper to be planted in the form of Standard-trees, I do not comprehend the <hi>little Muſcat-pear,</hi> though for its bigneſs and ſeaſon it might ſeem fitter than any other; no, the Canker which is apt to Seize on its Wood, and quite ſpoil it, hinders me to my great regret from planting any Trees of it in this faſhion; But that which I moſt willingly plant in this manner, is firſt, of <hi>Summer-Fruits</hi> (mark here the order of my choice) The <hi>Ruſſelet, the Cuiſſe-Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thigh,</hi> the <hi>Great Blanquet,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">What <hi>Summer-Pear Standards</hi> are fit to be Planted.</note> or <hi>White-pear,</hi> the <hi>Musked-Blanquet,</hi> the <hi>Musked-Summer-Boncretien,</hi> the <hi>Bourdon,</hi> or <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Bee pear,</hi> the <hi>Musked-Robert,</hi> the <hi>Pendar,</hi> or <hi>Hanging-pear,</hi> the <hi>Melting-pear of</hi> Breſt, and in a very large Plantation, I would add too, ſome <hi>Summer-Boncretiens,</hi> ſome <hi>Admiral Pears,</hi> &amp;c. For the Fruits of <hi>Autumn,</hi> thoſe which I chooſe, are the <hi>Lanſacs, Vine-pears, Ruſſelins,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">What <hi>Autumnal</hi> ones, and what <hi>Winter</hi> ones.</note> &amp;c. And for <hi>Winter-Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Dry Martin,</hi> the <hi>Ambret,</hi> the <hi>Winter-Ruſſelet,</hi> the <hi>Ronville,</hi> and perhaps, ſome <hi>Beſi de Caiſſoy-trees,</hi> and in fine, for Fruits to Bake, Preſerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will chooſe the little <hi>Certeau,</hi> the <hi>Frank-Royal,</hi> the <hi>Angober,</hi> the <hi>Donville.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There we have about twenty four ſorts of Standard <hi>Pear-trees</hi> to plant proſperouſly enough in our Gardens; But becauſe in Important places, as for example, in fine Kitching-Gardens, Baking and Preſerving Fruits are not conſiderable enough to be allowed any <note place="margin">Bakeing and Preſerving <hi>Pears,</hi> with <hi>Cherries,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Apples,</hi> &amp;c. beſt Planted apart in ſeparate Orchards.</note> room, and becauſe (as it is expedient for all them that conveniently can) we may have ſome of them in the ſeparate Orchards, deſigned only for Fruit, together with all ſorts of <hi>Cherry-trees, Agriots, Bigarros, Guignes,</hi> with all ſorts of good <hi>Apples, Pippins, Calvils, Apis, Fenouillets,</hi> or <hi>Fennel-Apple, Courpendus,</hi> or <hi>Short Hung,</hi> or <hi>Short Stalked Apples,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome good ſorts of <hi>Plums,</hi> that is to ſay, of <hi>Damask Plums of all ſorts,</hi> of <hi>Mirabelles,</hi> St. <hi>Catherines, Diapred Damasks,</hi> &amp;c. and laſtly with <hi>Mulberry-trees, Almond-trees, Azerol,</hi> or Garden <hi>Haw-trees,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore I ſay, ſince for theſe Reaſons, Fruits for Baking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may without any diſhonour to them, be planted elſewhere, far off from our Kitching-Gardens, we ſhould in their ſtead, particularly Multiply ſome Trees of the principal ſorts of our <hi>Summer-Fruits.</hi> I know the voice of all the World, as well as mine own will preſently give the firſt choice to the <hi>Ruſſelet-pears;</hi> ſo that we ſhall not think much to have at leaſt four great Trees of them to one of each of the other ſorts: The <hi>Ruſſelin,</hi> the <hi>Lanſac,</hi> the <hi>Ambret,</hi> and the <hi>Dry Martin,</hi> are likewiſe Trees that require each of them to be doubled before we double the other Kinds. A <hi>Summer Pear-tree</hi> that has been planted ten or twelve Years, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of yielding ſo great a quantity of Fruit of its kind, that 'twill be all we can do to ſpend them before the Rottenneſs that follows cloſe after their Ripeneſs, makes them good for nothing: And therefore, when we are contriving Plantations of Fruit-trees, we ſhould ſtill remember when we intermix in them any Standard-trees, that we muſt proportionably diminiſh the number of <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> which we ſhould otherwiſe be obliged to have of thoſe ſame kinds.</p>
                        <p>Methinks 'tis not amiſs to add here this Caution, that in reſpect of theſe Standard-trees, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Standards</hi> to be much leſs Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their Heads than <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> to make them bear ſo much the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> it is good in planting them, to leave them ſome of the branches of their tops which they had when in the Nurſery Garden, becauſe they will bear Fruit ſo much the ſooner, and becauſe the heighth of their Trunks is not ſo exactly regulated as that of the <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> whether that heighth begin a foot higher or lower, their ſhape will be never the leſs comly for that, and it is always a conſiderable advantage, this ſort of Trees may be made to afford us of advancing their Fruitfulneſs, which we can hardly ever draw from the <hi>Dwarf-trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:48210:88"/>
I have hitherto examined only the Conduct we are to obſerve in diſpoſing the good <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> to have as many of them in our Gardens, as 'tis poſſible, as well in the form of <hi>Dwarf,</hi> as Standard-trees: But I have not yet ſpoken of thoſe great <hi>Boncretien Pear-trees</hi> they have in the Courts of ſome Houſes in many Provinces in the hotter Climates, nor of ſome other more common <hi>Pear-trees</hi> which they have in other parts, in other Courts.</p>
                        <p>Nor have I yet ſpoken any thing of the great <hi>Pear</hi> plantations, planted for the making of <hi>Perry</hi> in thoſe places where Vines cannot proſper. As to the two firſt points, becauſe I have nothing to ſay to them, as being of no manner of conſequence, but only barely for the pleaſure of ſome particular Perſons, I leave it wholly to each perſon to do in them what he ſhall find beſt for his own ſatisfaction; for the ſucceſs he ſhall meet with may ſerve him for a Rule.</p>
                        <p>However, 'tis convenient to advertiſe you, that in places, which we ſay, are much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <note n="*" place="margin">That is, places near High-ways, where many People paſs.</note> 
                           <hi>Secular Arm,</hi> we ought to have this fore-caſt, not to plant any Fruit there that is eatable whilſt on the Tree, otherwiſe 'tis certain, all the Fruit that will come to the Owner from thence will be only a great deal of Vexation, and little elſe.</p>
                        <p>As for what concerns the plantations of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> or <hi>Apple-trees</hi> deſigned for the making of <hi>Cyder</hi> or <hi>Perry;</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf with only telling you, that in them, the Trees are planted at threeſcore, or threeſcore and twelve foot, one from another, becauſe that proportion obſerved, hinders not the Grounds in which they grow, at leaſt for ſeveral Years together, from being ſown Yearly with good Corn, the Plowing up, and other Culture uſed for the latter, extreamly contributing to the well cultivating of the other: I leave what is more to be ſaid to this Article, to the Diſcuſſion of thoſe to whom thoſe Liquors are neceſſary, or at leaſt very convenient, or which as paſſionately love them as I do good Fruits which are the chief delights of the Nobility and Gentry.</p>
                        <p>It is now time to examine what ſorts of <hi>Pear-trees</hi> we ſhall plant againſt Walls, I know very well there is not any ſort of them which that Situation would not very well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date by contributing much to the largeneſs of their Fruit, and the certainty of their bearing and bringing their productions to perfection, when the ſpiteful <hi>Tyger-Babbs</hi> will give them leave to do it; But I likewiſe no leſs certainly know, that that there are ſome of <note place="margin">To what <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> the Wall is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> them which ſtand ſo much in need of the aſſiſtance of the Wall, that they cannot live and thrive without it. And we have hinted in ſeveral places in the foregoing part of this Treatiſe, that the <hi>Bergamots</hi> particularly lay under this neceſſity, and the little <hi>Muſcat-pears</hi> ſtill more than they: The Wall is further indiſpenſably requiſite for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of well Coloured <hi>Boncretiens.</hi> But becauſe if we have never ſo few Walls expoſed to a kindly Sun, we ought to have ſo much regard to them as to employ them as uſefully as they deſerve, and according to the importance of the Fruits that challange place there, I think I ought to treat of the <hi>Pears</hi> that may be planted in that Scituation, before I come to treat particularly of the order which is to be obſerved for the filling up every Wall with all ſorts of good Fruits, as well as 'tis poſſible to fill them; and that is the order I propoſed to my ſelf at the very beginning of this Treatiſe: After I have drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a particular Liſt of the firſt Five Hundred <hi>Dwarf-pear-trees</hi> which I have placed here a little above, and after I have told you in particular, which, in my opinion, are the <hi>Good-pears,</hi> which the <hi>Indifferent ones,</hi> and laſtly which are they that are ſo bad, that I would adviſe no body to plant them at all, I will conclude this Chapter, with informing you what other Fruits, beſides <hi>Pears,</hi> proſper well upon <hi>Dwarf-trees,</hi> and then proceed to ſpeak of all ſorts of <hi>Wall-Fruits,</hi> and of the method of diſpoſing them, in a ſeparate Diſcourſe.</p>

                        <p>SInce <hi>Apples</hi> make a part of our <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> and a very conſiderable part too, as well in reſpect of their Goodneſs, and Laſting Quality, as of the Convenience they afford us, of having them either growing upon little <hi>Dwarf Trees,</hi> grafted upon <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe-Apple-Stocks,</hi> or upon larger <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> grafted upon <hi>Wild</hi> or <hi>Crab-ſtocks,</hi> I will take the opportunity in this place to ſet down what I would Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel Gentlemen to plant of them, before I proceed to ſpeak of <hi>Wall Trees,</hi> among which, I ſeldom or never admit them Entrance.</p>
                        <p>Among the <hi>Apples</hi> that are good to Eat Raw, or Baked, or otherwiſe prepared, (for <note place="margin">Seven principal ſorts of Fating and Preſerving Apples.</note> I meddle not here with <hi>Cyder-Apples,)</hi> I count Seven principal ſorts, that is to ſay, the <hi>Gray-Pippin,</hi> the <hi>White,</hi> or <hi>Frank-Pippin,</hi> the <hi>Autumn Calvill,</hi> the <hi>Fennellet,</hi> or <hi>Fennell-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Cour-pendu,</hi> or <hi>ſhort-hung,</hi> or <hi>ſhort-ſtalk'd-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Api,</hi> and the <hi>Violet-Apple.</hi> There are ſome others which I prize not ſo much, tho' they are no bad Fruit, as the <hi>Rambour,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Other ſorts leſs valuable, but yet good.</note> the <hi>Summer-Calvill,</hi> the <hi>Couſinotte,</hi> the <hi>Orgeran,</hi> the <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Thick Pairmain,</hi> the <hi>Ice-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Francatu,</hi> the <hi>Hiute-Bontée,</hi> or <hi>High-goodneſs,</hi> the <hi>Royalty,</hi> the <hi>Rouvezeau,</hi> the <hi>Cheſnut-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Pigconnet,</hi> or <hi>Pigcon-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Paſs-pomme,</hi> or <hi>Paſſing-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Petit-bon,</hi> or <hi>Small-good,</hi> the <hi>Fig-Apple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>All <hi>Apples</hi> pretty near reſemble one another in their flat figure, and ſhort ſtalk, and <note place="margin">Apples deſcribed in general.</note> the moſt part of them in bigneſs too, and in their ſhort Eating Pulp, but they are very different in Colour.</p>
                        <p>I know not above two or three ſorts that are bigger than the others, namely, the <hi>Rambours,</hi> the <hi>Calvills,</hi> and the <hi>Ice-Applos,</hi> and but three or four that are more long

than flat, namely, the <hi>Calvills,</hi> the <hi>Violets,</hi> the <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> and the <hi>Ice-Apples,</hi> and they are thicker towards the ſtalk than towards the head, ſo that we muſt conceive the moſt part of them flat, without any further Deſcription.</p>
                        <p>The Two ſorts of <hi>Pippins</hi> are diſtinguiſhed by the Two Names of <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>White</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The Two ſorts of <hi>Pippins, Gray</hi> and <hi>VVhite.</hi>
                           </note> which they bear, being in other reſpects of an equal goodneſs; good <hi>Compôtes,</hi> or Wet Sweet-Meats may be made of them at all times, and they begin to be eaten Raw towards the Month of <hi>January;</hi> before that time, they have a little point of ſharpneſs <note place="margin">Their Seaſon and Character.</note> which pleaſes not ſome people, but unhappily aſſoon as ever they begin to be entirely free of that, they contract a ſmell that is much more diſpleaſing, and which is rendred ſtill more diſagreeable, when the ſmell of the Straw upon which they are laid to Mellow, intermixes therewith. In ſine, it may be ſaid, to the advantage of theſe Pippins, that they are very profitably made uſe of almoſt all the Year long; and to their diſadvantage, it may be no leſs truly affirmed, that their Neighbourhood is infinitely diſagreeable and incommodious.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Autumnal-Calvills</hi> reſemble one another pretty near in their lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh ſhape, and in their Colour, which is of a Blood-Red, but yet the <hi>Summer-Calvill</hi> is <note place="margin">

                        <p>And theſe are all the <hi>Apples</hi> as near as I can reckon, that I know, after a very exact Scrutiny, and becauſe there is no great difference among them in goodneſs, I willingly content my ſelf with the ſeven firſt ſorts, for which I have expreſt ſome eſteem, and ſhall make no ſcruple to plant a conſiderable quantity of them, provided they be graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Paradiſe Apple-ſtocks,</hi> that being a <hi>Tree</hi> that ſhoots forth little Wood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <note place="margin">

the <hi>Surface,</hi> and outward <hi>Crust</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> By the means of theſe little <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> I have the convenience to allow my ſelf almoſt as many <hi>Trees</hi> of one ſort of <hi>Apples,</hi> as of the other, and ſince theſe little <hi>Trees</hi> are agreeable enough to the ſight in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> it follows naturally enough from thence, that they produce no ill effect in little ones.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore we have nothing elſe to do but to determine what kinds of them to <note place="margin">What proportion of Trees of each choice ſort of Apples, it is beſt to plant, from the total Number of Fifty, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundreds.</note> plant, and what number of each kind, and this is my Method with them; if I have room enough to plant a conſiderable number of them, as for Example, from fifty, to one or two hundred; I plant two thirds of the total number, of theſe four ſorts, <hi>Gray-pippins, White-pippins, Autumn-Calvills,</hi> and <hi>Apis-apples,</hi> of each an equal number; and for the remaining third part, I divide it into three portions, which I employ in <hi>Trees</hi> of theſe three other kinds, <hi>viz. Fennellets, Cour-pendu's,</hi> and <hi>Violet-apples.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And proceeding in this manner, in fifty <hi>Apple-Trees,</hi> I ſhall have eight <hi>Gray Pippin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,</hi> eight of <hi>White Pippins,</hi> eight <hi>Autumn-Calvills,</hi> eight <hi>Apis,</hi> ſix <hi>Fennelets,</hi> ſix <hi>Cour-pendu's,</hi> and ſix <hi>Violet-apples.</hi> In a hundred <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> I ſhall have ſixteen of each of the four firſt principal ſorts, and twelve of each of the other three, and ſo proportionably in the number of two hundred. But when we ſhall have occaſion to plant three, four, or five hundred, I ſhall mix with them a twelfth part compoſed of <hi>Summer-Calvills</hi> and <hi>Rambours;</hi> and ſo at that rate, there would be in three hundred <hi>Apples,</hi> twelve <hi>Summer-Calvills,</hi> and twelve <hi>Rambours,</hi> with fourty three <hi>Gray-pippins,</hi> fourty three <hi>White pippins,</hi> fourty three <hi>Autumn-Calvills,</hi> fourty three <hi>Apis,</hi> thirty two <hi>Fennellets,</hi> thirty two <hi>Cour-pendu's,</hi> and thirty two <hi>Violet-apples,</hi> and ſo forwards in greater numbers of each ſort, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame Proportion.</p>
                        <p>And if any curious Perſon be minded to add beſides, ſome other <hi>Apples,</hi> as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſome <hi>Jeruſalem Petit-bons,</hi> or <hi>Little-goods, Cheſtnut-apples,</hi> &amp;c. he may do his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but in my Opinion, that is, according to my taſte, theſe others are not ſo good as thoſe ſeven kinds which I here preferr before the reſt.</p>
                        <p>There remains but one difficulty more to clear, which is to direct what is to be done <note place="margin">What ſorts of <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> and in what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is beſt to plant in little Gardens.</note> in very little <hi>Gardens,</hi> in which I freely counſel that ſome little <hi>Apple-trees</hi> be planted; there needs but a very little room to place half a dozen, or a whole dozen of them, without ſo much as the Company of any <hi>Pear-trees</hi> among them, and without harming any of the little <hi>Plants</hi> we have a mind ſhould grow under them. In ſuch a Caſe, I would plant but ſix or twelve <hi>Apis,</hi> which when loaden with Fruit, would be a very pretty ornament to ſuch a little <hi>Garden,</hi> and if there were room to place two dozen, there ſhould be eight <hi>Apis,</hi> eight <hi>Autumn-Calvills,</hi> and eight <hi>Cour-pendu's;</hi> if there were occaſion for fourty, they ſhould be parted among thoſe three above-ſaid kinds, together with the <hi>Fennellet,</hi> and <hi>Violet-Apples,</hi> and ſo there ſhould be ſtill eight of each ſort; that is to ſay, I would hardly plant any <hi>Pippins</hi> at all among them, they being ſo eaſy to be had every where for Money, and Peoples curioſity leading them to covet the other ſorts rather than them.</p>

                              <hi>The four</hi> Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Eaſterly, VVeſterly. Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>and</hi> Southerly, <hi>defined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</hi>
                           </note> from its Riſing till Noon, at what hour ſoever it begins to riſe; and that a <hi>Weſterly Expoſition,</hi> which is ſhone upon the ſecond half of the Day; that is to ſay, which begins to be ſhone upon immediately after Noon, and continues to be ſo till Sun-ſetting. And we ſtyle that a <hi>Southerly Expoſition,</hi> which beginning in Summer time, to enjoy the comfortable ſmiles of the Sun, ſoon after his riſing is not totally deprived of them till he be almoſt ready to diſappear from among us, or perhaps not till he be actually out of ſight, or to ſpeak more generally, we call that a <hi>Southern Expoſition,</hi> that is it ſelf alone conſtantly ſhone upon longer than either of the two former taken ſeparately, and there are ſome Gardens ſo advantageouſly turned, that one of their Walls is almoſt the whole day cheriſhed by the Sun-Beams.</p>
                        <p>I expreſs in the Treatiſe of Plantations, what ſorts of Expoſitions I affect moſt, and counſel others to affect too, that have as we ſay, a whole piece of Cloath to cut out as they liſt, in order to the contriving themſelves both a fair and good Garden, which is a Happineſs, not very ordinarily to be met with, eſpecially in great Cities, where Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are under a thouſand Subjections to their Houſes, for which their Gardens are made, and to which they muſt be accommodated, and conſequently are ſuch Subjections from which they can hardly ever exempt themſelves.</p>
                        <p>After all we have ſaid about the three good <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> it is no hard matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the unhappy <hi>Northerly Expoſition</hi> is that which enjoys the Sun, only during that little time in which the <hi>Southerly</hi> one has him not; for the Sun cannot ſhine upon two Walls directly oppoſite one to the other, at the ſame time. The Portion of thoſe of the <hi>North,</hi> then, is to enjoy from the <hi>Equinox</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to that of <hi>September,</hi> the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Rays of the Sun that appear above our <hi>Horizon;</hi> that is to ſay, to be ſhone upon betimes in the Morning, and that ſometimes for an hour or two, and ſometimes for three or four, but ſometimes they run the danger of having but a very ſhort view of him towards Evening; nay and very often, of having none at all.</p>
                        <p>It follows from this Explication of <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> that there is no Wall that has not as leaſt ſome little glance of the Sun once a day, and that is a favour always to be counted for ſomething.</p>
                        <p>And this, if I miſtake not, is the proper place in which I ought to tell you, that the Sun never begins to ſhine upon one Wall, but he ſhines upon two at the ſame time, and <note place="margin">The Sun always ſhines upon two Walls at once and how.</note> they are thoſe that concurr to make the common Angle in which the two joyn that are ſo ſhone upon; thus when he riſes, he ordinarily ſhines at once upon the <hi>Northern</hi> Wall, and part of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> one, and as ſoon as ever the progreſs of his Courſe, carries him out of the ſight of that of the <hi>North,</hi> He inſenſibly extends his Beams to that of the <hi>South,</hi> yet ſo as not for a good while after to quit that of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but ſhining upon both at once; in the ſame manner alſo he leaves not off ſhining on the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wall, but in order to advance himſelf by little and little to the <hi>Weſtern Expoſition,</hi> and to continue in the mean while his favourable Aſpect to the <hi>Southerly</hi> Wall, ſo that thoſe two Walls are likewiſe at the ſame time gratified with his cheering Rays.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48210:95"/>
And thus every day begins and ends that glorious progreſs and courſe of the Sun, which cauſes the fertility of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the goodneſs of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the Joy and Pleaſure of Mankind: But he finiſhes it not however, without ſcattering ſome ſmall Remains of his laſt Melancholy and Expiring Splendour upon the poor <hi>Northern</hi> Wall, he gives it a ſlight viſit in paſſing, that is to ſay properly, he only glances lightly by it when he is got beyond the reach of its <hi>Southern</hi> Oppoſite. Any two Walls that are diametrically oppoſite one to the other, are never ſhone upon at the ſame time, unleſs it be juſt in the moment the Sun is paſſing from one to the other; for then that great Torch <note place="margin">When the Sun ſeems to ſtand, and ſhines a ſmall moment upon the three Walls at once.</note> which is always advancing with an unconceivable Rapidity, appears as if he were for ſome time ſtopt, and ſixt, though he really be not, and then he may be truly ſaid to view three different <hi>Expoſitions</hi> at the ſame time; but that being only juſt as he is going to quit the ſight of that of the three, which he had thitherto continued the longeſt looks towards, and beginning to turn his Countenance towards the other, which is directly oppoſite to it, cannot be of any long duration. Upon which, I ſuppoſe, there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any tall <hi>Trees</hi> nor high Walls, nor neighbouring Houſes that may obſtruct the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the Sun's light upon any of the <hi>Expoſitions</hi> we are examining, otherwiſe we ſhall never be able to lay down any thing poſitive for the inſtructions we intend to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>After having thus explained what we mean in terms of <hi>Gardening,</hi> by <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſon may eaſily judge of thoſe he has in his own <hi>Garden,</hi> whether it be walled quite about, or only in part; as we ſee in thoſe for Example, that are cloſed on ſome ſides only with Rivers, Ditches, or quick Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But though I were informed of the extent of the ſurface of every <hi>Garden,</hi> that would not enable me to calculate any thing near what extent of walling it will take up. For Example, though an <hi>Arpent</hi> or <hi>Acre</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> Meaſure, contains nine hundred Toiſes or Fathoms of <hi>Superficies,</hi> yet it may be, that this <hi>Superficies</hi> may be reduced to a perfect <note place="margin">What is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and content of an <hi>Arpent,</hi> or <hi>Paris Acre.</hi>
                           </note> Square of thirty Toiſes or Fathoms every way, and ſo ſuch an <hi>Arpent</hi> or <hi>Acre</hi> will contain but one hundred and twenty Fathoms in Compaſs, that is to ſay, ſixty Yards for each of the four <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> which is as little Walling as a <hi>Paris Acre</hi> of <hi>Ground</hi> can have.</p>
                        <p>Some ſuch <hi>Acres</hi> may alſo have one hundred and thirty, one hundred and fifty, two hundred, two hundred and eighteen, and ſometimes as many as three hundred and <note place="margin">What quantity of compaſs ſuch an <hi>Acre</hi> or <hi>Arpent</hi> may have, and what Walling it may require in ſeveral ſorts of Figures, as a perfect Squaes. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> twelve Fathoms Circumference, and more; which will happen, if in the firſt occaſion there be ſuppoſed two large ſides of forty five Fathoms each, and two leſſer ones each of twenty; if in the ſecond there be two long ſides of ſixty, and two ſhorter ones of fifteen Fathoms each; if in the third there be two long ſides of fourſcore and ten, and two ſhorter ones of ten Fathoms each; if in the Fourth, ſuppoſed to be a Triangular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, there be two ſides of one hundred Fathoms each, and a ſhort one of eighteen. And laſtly, if in the fifth, this <hi>Acre</hi> have two long ſides of a hundred and fifty Fathoms each, and two ſhort ones of Six Fathoms each, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which indeed would make a very odd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited <hi>Garden,</hi> and one ridiculous enough. But however ſuch a Caſe may poſſibly happen.</p>
                        <p>After all, I can truly ſay, that I cannot exactly calculate what quantity of Walling every piece of <hi>Ground</hi> will require for its entire encloſure, ſince as I have juſt now ſhewed you, one and the ſame quantity of Superficies may have a great deal more, or a great deal leſs, according to the greater or leſſer length of the ſides of the ſaid Land.</p>
                        <p>In fine, it is pleaſant enough to ſee, that if a Square have two hundred Fathoms of <note place="margin">A pretty Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubincloſures made out of greater ones.</note> Walling in its Circumference, and we be minded to make a ſeparate incloſure of the quarter, or of the half of the ſaid ſquare, that quarter will take up one hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, which is the half of the whole, and that half will take up one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, three quarters of the whole; <hi>Geometry</hi> ſatisfies us with good Reaſons for all thoſe differences, which belonging not to my ſubject, I omit.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I ſhall not define what Circumference a Garden may have, nor what <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> becauſe I cannot, but ſhall only tell you how many <hi>Trees</hi> each <hi>Expoſition</hi> may <note place="margin">The number and diſtances of <hi>Trees</hi> to be ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different height of the Walls, or quality of the <hi>Ground.</hi>
                           </note> admit, in reſpect to two things, <hi>viz.</hi> the heighth of the Walls, and the goodneſs of the <hi>Ground,</hi> for the better the <hi>Ground</hi> is, the more <hi>Trees</hi> it is able to nouriſh, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be ſaid of that which is lean and barren; likewiſe the higher the Walls are the greater number of <hi>Trees</hi> may be applyed to them; that is to ſay, we may place them ſo much the nearer one another, and by this means order them ſo, that between two, which we may reſerve to garniſh the lower part of the Wall, there may be always one to ſhoot up and garniſh the upper part, that ſo the upper and lower parts of our Fruit-Walls may be both garniſhed at once, and conſequently yield us Fruit ſo much the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in the greater quantity. The contrary is likewiſe true in reſpect of Walls that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48210:96"/>
are low, always conſidering withal, the quality of the Soil; that is to ſay, the lower the Walls, ſo much the further the <hi>Trees</hi> are to be placed one from another, and thoſe very diſtances muſt ſtill be more enlarged when the ground is very rich, than when it is but indifferently qualified.</p>
                        <p>And here it is needful to explain and make you underſtand the following Truth which <note place="margin">A Difficulty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of <hi>wall-trees.</hi> In what caſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in good Soils, they are to be placed nearer one another, than otherwiſe.</note> ſeems a little Paradoxical: Our deſign in Planting <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> is indeed to have ſo much the fairer Fruit, but ſtill more chiefly, to ſecure the greater ſtore of it; but <hi>Trees</hi> do not infallibly yield Fruit, unleſs it be upon feeble Branches, and therefore we ſhall have no Fruit upon our <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> unleſs we contrive it ſo, that we may have ſome feeble Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on them: And if the <hi>Trees</hi> he very vigorous, as they are commonly in good Soils, they cannot produce any feeble Branches, unleſs they be allowed a great deal of room to ſpread out to the beſt advantage all thoſe that are fit to bear; becauſe, that ſuppoſing they be Planted too near one another, and the <hi>Walls</hi> be not high enough, they muſt neceſſarily be Pruned very ſhort, or elſe they will ſhoot above the <hi>Wall,</hi> and conſequently ceaſe to be <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> or elſe they will ſo intangle their Branches one with another, that they will make a very diſagreeable confuſion, and ſuch a one as will prove as prejudicial to the Fruit, as if they had been cut too ſhort.</p>
                        <p>If then they be Curbed in that manner; that is to ſay, if we leave them not Branches of ſome reaſonable thickneſs and length, all the young ſhoots they will produce will be always thick, and thick ones bear no Fruit, and conſequently good <hi>Trees</hi> Planted near one another in a good ground will bear no Fruit, and all through the Gard'ner's fault: And therefore it follows by an undoubted conſequence, that in good Soils, whoſe <hi>Walls</hi> are but low, we ought to allow very conſiderable diſtances between <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Tree,</hi> if we would pretend any ſtore of fair Fruit from them; and that when the <hi>Walls</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we may and ought to place the <hi>Trees</hi> nearer one another, as I have already ſhewed; now I ſhall proceed to tell you what is my Advice concerning the Meaſure and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe Diſtances.</p>
                        <p>My Judgment is, that no <hi>Walls</hi> of incloſure ought to be made leſs than Seven or <note place="margin">Of what height Walls ought to be, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral allowable proportions of that height, <hi>viz.</hi> never to be leſs than 7 or 8, and never more than 15 or 16 Foot.</note> Eight Foot high, as well for the better ſecurity againſt Robbing and Spoiling to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from abroad, as for the advancing and improving the goodneſs of the <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> I likewiſe am of Opinion, that in the good <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> it is not convenient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>Walls</hi> of above Fifteen or Sixteen Foot; for as for thoſe of the <hi>North,</hi> which we call bad ones, the higheſt <hi>Walls</hi> are ordinarily the worſt, for they caſt long ſhadows of pernicious influence to Gardens, but yet we ſhall endeavour to make a good uſe of them, and eſpecially in Soils a little dry, and in pretty hot Climates.</p>
                        <p>By all I have newly ſaid about the heighth of <hi>Walls,</hi> it appears, that I have little <note place="margin">Leaning Walls not proper.</note> value for thoſe <hi>Leaning-Walls</hi> to pretend to make them <hi>Fruit-Walls</hi> for <hi>Pears, Peaches, Apricocks,</hi> &amp;c. but they may ſerve for ſomething elſe, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards: It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appears, I do not much approve the extraordinary heighths of ſome topping <hi>Walls</hi> of Houſes, or of Churches, though I make uſe of them very advantageouſly when I meet with any of them expoſed to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>South;</hi> and that is, particularly to raiſe <hi>Figs</hi> againſt them, which as they love nothing ſo much as heat and ſhelter, ſo they apprehend nothing ſo much as the Cold Winds and <hi>Scabbineſs;</hi> and <hi>High Walls</hi> are very proper, as well to do them all the good they need, as to defend them from the Miſchiefs which attack them.</p>
                        <p>When I here ſo much extoll the Conveniences of the <hi>High Walls</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Quarters, I ſuppoſe it to be in Climates where the Heat is but ſmall, or at leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate; for in thoſe which are hot and burning, as thoſe of our <hi>Provence,</hi> and of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> or that exceed them ſtill in heat, as thoſe Countries that lie nearer the <hi>Line,</hi> in thoſe Climates, ſuch <hi>Walls</hi> are as formidable and pernicious to Fruits which do but broil and cleave or chap againſt them, and to <hi>Trees</hi> which they dry up, and kill, as the <hi>Northern Walls</hi> are uneaſie, and contrary to the ripening of Fruits in other places that offend in want of Heat, and exceſs of Moiſture.</p>

                        <p>BEfore I proceed to Regulate the Meaſures of the Diſtances to be obſerved in the placing of all ſorts of <hi>Trees</hi> that are to be Planted againſt <hi>Walls,</hi> becauſe there are ſome kinds of Fruits that require very different Diſtances from others, I think, that for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48210:96"/>
the better underſtanding of what I am to deliver upon that ſubject, it will be neceſſary I ſhould firſt examine what Fruits really deſerve admittance to this choice ſituation; and ſecondly, which, as unworthy, are to be excluded.</p>
                        <p>Of the firſt ſort are all the good kinds of <hi>Figs, Peaches, Plums, Pears,</hi> and <hi>Grapes,</hi> with the <hi>Haſting,</hi> or <hi>Forward-Cherries;</hi> all ſorts of <hi>Apricocks</hi> are alſo of that number, with ſome <hi>Azerolls,</hi> or <hi>Garden-Haws.</hi> I ſpeak expreſsly of the good kinds of every ſort of Fruit, to ſhew, that I admit not indifferently to the Privilege of the <hi>Wall,</hi> all ſorts of <hi>Figs, Peaches, Plums, Pears,</hi> &amp;c. And then ſecondly, thoſe which ordinarily are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it, are <hi>Apples, Mulberries, Almonds,</hi> ordinary <hi>Cherries, Agriots, Bigarros, Quinces,</hi> &amp;c. unleſs it be when we have ſo great a quantity of <hi>Walling,</hi> that we know not, as I may ſay, how to diſpoſe of it, and therefore reſolve out of Curioſity, to fill up the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous places of it with ſome <hi>Trees</hi> of thoſe ſorts of Fruits.</p>
                        <p>Of all the Fruits that have rank and place among <hi>Wall-Fruits,</hi> thoſe that require the leaſt diſtance one from another, are all ſorts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> they contenting themſelves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Grapes</hi> require the leaſt diſtance of any <hi>wall-fruit.</hi>
                           </note> where with Two Feet, or Two Feet and a half diſtance at moſt, and therefore there will be no difficulty in regulating their diſtances, as there will be in ordering that of other Fruits. Thoſe which muſt be allowed good large diſtances, are <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Plums: Pears</hi> need not quite ſo great, nor <hi>Haſting,</hi> or <hi>Forward-Cherries,</hi> but the <hi>Apricock</hi> and <hi>Fig-trees</hi> commonly require greater than all the reſt; the firſt, becauſe they ſhoot <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fig-trees</hi> need moſt of any, and why.</note> forth very thick Branches which it is dangerous to cut too ſhort; and the latter, becauſe they are little ſubject to Pruning, and ſhoot up mightily in their ſtock, and therefore have need of a conſiderable extent of room, or elſe they will hardly bring any Fruit.</p>
                        <p>To treat of all theſe with the more Order and Brevity, I will divide them into Two <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Trees</hi> in relation to diſtances, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Two <hi>Claſſes,</hi> viz. 1. requiring large diſtances, and 2. requiring ſmaller; and what Fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to each. The chief Rules for diſtances ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the height of the <hi>walls,</hi> and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soil. Rules for the firſt ſize of <hi>walls</hi> of Seven or Eight Foot high. The diſtance.</note> 
                           <hi>Claſſes,</hi> One, for thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> that commonly take up more room, which ſhall be the Firſt <hi>Claſs;</hi> and another, for thoſe that take up leſs, and that ſhall be the Second. The Firſt <hi>Claſs</hi> comprehends <hi>Figs, Peaches, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Apricocks;</hi> the Second compriſes <hi>Pears, Haſty,</hi> or <hi>Forward-Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Azerolls,</hi> or <hi>Garden-Haws:</hi> Which Two <hi>Claſſes</hi> muſt be well obſerved, for the full underſtanding of my Diſtinctions.</p>
                        <p>Now, as we have already ſaid, the principal things that muſt Regulate all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, muſt be the greater or leſſer heighth of the <hi>Walls,</hi> or greater or leſſer good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soil. And accordingly, my Cuſtom is to order them in this following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conformably to my aboveſaid ſuppoſition of Two <hi>Claſſes</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againſt <hi>Walls</hi> that are about Seven or Eight Foot high, or a little more, if the Ground be good, and the Soil freſh and hearty, as it is in many places, I place the <hi>Trees</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Claſs</hi> at Twelve Foot diſtance one from the other, and thoſe of the Second, at Nine; but if the Soil be but indifferently qualified, I place the Firſt at Eight or Nine; and the Second, at Seven or Eight Foot diſtance.</p>
                        <p>The diſtance of Twelve Foot ſurpriſes a Gentleman raw and unexperienced in theſe <note place="margin">Reaſons for the diſtance of 12 Foot ſometimes in Plantations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt ſuch <hi>walls.</hi>
                           </note> Curioſities, who has not many <hi>Walls</hi> to fill up; for example, a Gentleman that has but Threeſcore or Fourſcore Yards of Walling, when he ſees himſelf confined to Plant but Fifteen or Twenty <hi>Trees</hi> againſt it, he is apt to fear two things, the firſt is, that he ſhall hardly ever ſee his <hi>Walls</hi> well garniſh'd; and the ſecond, that he ſhall as hardly ever <note place="margin">Objected Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Fears Anſwered and Remedied.</note> have much Fruit: But beſides the inconveniences, which, as I have ſhewn, ariſe from Planting <hi>Trees</hi> too near one another, as well in regard of the Barrenneſs it cauſes in them, as of the greater trouble it gives for their Cultivation; I ſay, beſides this, firſt, we may confidently expect, that <hi>Trees</hi> Planted in a good Soil, will be brisk, and eaſily ſhoot forth every Year ſeveral young Branches of Four or Five Foot long apiece; and that ſo, according to that rate, being Planted in ſuch a Soil, and againſt <hi>Walls</hi> but of a ſmall heighth, and at Twelve Foot diſtance one from another, which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence makes round about them, about Six Foot for each <hi>Tree</hi> to Garniſh as well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as on each ſide of them, ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> I ſay will certainly in few Years come near one another, and therefore will not leave the ſpaces between them long void: And ſo this will be a ſpeedy Remedy againſt the Gentleman's firſt fear.</p>
                        <p>To Remedy the Second, He may venture to plant double the number of <hi>Trees</hi> I have before limitted, if he like to be at that Charge, notwithſtanding my aboveſaid advice which is againſt it, and ſo place them at the diſtances of Six Foot, to pleaſe his Eye with ſeeing his Wall ſo much the ſooner garniſhed, but then it muſt be upon condition, that at the end of Three or Four Years, when thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> ſhall be in a condition to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to act their parts well in bearing Fruit, to recompenſe by that means the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have conſumed, and the pains they have coſt; I ſay, it muſt be upon this condition, that the Gentleman be of a temper at the expiration of that time, to be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſecuring the flouriſhing condition of the reſt, to ſacrifice the ſuperfluous half, by

And methinks people are but too apt to make uſe of the firſt expedient when they begin their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and in earneſt, it is that which moſt of any thing tickles the Fancy of thoſe that are apt to reckon upon their ſtore of Fruit from the number of their <hi>Trees,</hi> but we find few that can find in their hearts to proceed to the Execution of the Second, when the time that requires it is come, and ſo by that imprudent and unſeaſonable pity, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly fall into thoſe Inconveniences which I have mentioned; ſo that the ſureſt way is, not to be at any ſuch unprofitable Expences, nor to give our ſelves ſuch occaſions to have thoſe Combats afterwards within our ſelves; and therefore I Counſel Gentlemen rather to follow the Advice I propoſe in obſerving the diſtances I preſcribe between <hi>Trees</hi> to be planted in ſpecial good Soils.</p>
                        <p>Let us now proceed to planting our <hi>Trees</hi> by <hi>Walls</hi> of Nine Foot high, or more, and <note place="margin">Rules for <hi>walls</hi> of between Nine and Eleven Foot.</note> let us tell you, That if the ground be good, as I have before ſuppoſed, then the diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Trees</hi> of the firſt <hi>Claſs</hi> ſhall be proportioned at Nine or Ten Foot, and thoſe of the ſecond, at Seven or Eight; but if the ground be not very good, Eight Foot will ſuffice for the firſt, and Seven for the ſecond: Where Note by the by, that tho' the difference of a Foot more or leſs, as well in the heighth of the <hi>Walls,</hi> as the diſtance of the <hi>Trees,</hi> ſeems no great matter, yet is it of very conſiderable influence for the good or bad ſucceſs of a <hi>Wall Plantation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Wall</hi> reach the heighth of Eleven or Twelve Foot, or a little more, and the <note place="margin">Rules for <hi>walls</hi> of Eleven or Twelve Foot.</note> ground be full as good as we deſire, then I plant the <hi>Trees</hi> half as near again as by the <hi>Walls</hi> above mentioned, taking care all along, that between every Two <hi>Trees</hi> of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stature, which are managed ſo as to garniſh the lower part of the <hi>Wall,</hi> there be one which may ſhoot up and garniſh it above; for which purpoſe, we may have ſome <hi>Trees</hi> of the true Standard-kind, which prove very uſeful, eſpecially for <hi>Pear-Trees, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Trees, Apricock-Trees,</hi> and even for <hi>Peach</hi> and <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> too, tho' for theſe two laſt, we may do well enough without them, becauſe they are <hi>Trees</hi> that commonly in little time put forth ſhoots big enough to form very fine Stemms or Bodies, and conſequently fit to mount up and garniſh the upper part of our <hi>Walls.</hi> In ſuch a Caſe then, where the <hi>Walls</hi> are very high, I add as many <hi>Trees</hi> more; and for that reaſon, if the Soil be good, place them at about Six Foot diſtance one from another; and if it be but indifferently qualified, I reduce their diſtances to Four or Five Foot, making my account, that by this means, the head of each of thoſe taller <hi>Trees</hi> will garniſh about Five or Six Foot of the <hi>Wall</hi> on each ſide of them, which it will eaſily do, provided that at the end of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Eight Years, if we perceive their vigour flag, care be taken to put a little freſh Mold between every Couple of <hi>Trees,</hi> to reſtore it, and to repair that heart in the ground which ſo many Roots may have exhauſted, or brought low; but ſo long as we perceive no change in the <hi>Trees</hi> to the Worſe, we need not trouble our ſelves to do any thing to the Earth.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall Advertiſe you by the way, that one of the things that moſt diſpleaſes me in <hi>Wall-Plantations,</hi> is, to ſee <hi>Vines, Figs, Stone Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Kernel Fruit,</hi> interlaced Pell-mell one among another againſt one <hi>Wall;</hi> I thinking it much more convenient to place eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kind in a ſeparate quarter by themſelves; ſo as for Example, one good <hi>Wall</hi> might be only for <hi>Figs,</hi> and another for <hi>Peaches, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> the mixture of which, I do not much condemn, becauſe that the <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> being more ſubject to periſh and die, in whole, or in part, either by Accident, or by Age, than thoſe other Fruits, there may always remain in our <hi>Wall-Plantation</hi> ſome other <hi>Trees</hi> to keep up its Beauty in caſe of any Mortality hapning to the <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> another end of a <hi>Wall</hi> ſhould be for <hi>Pear-Trees;</hi> which as near as 'twere poſſible, I would by no means mix with the <hi>Peach-Trees:</hi> In fine, another part of this <hi>Plantation</hi> ſhould be for the <hi>Early,</hi> or <hi>Haſting-Cherries,</hi> and another for the <hi>Grapes,</hi> which laſt I would have alſo ſeparated into ſeveral quarters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different ſorts, without confounding together the <hi>Muſcats,</hi> or <hi>Musk,</hi> or <hi>Muſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine-Grapes,</hi> with the <hi>Chaſſelas, Corinthians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes indeed I chance to place ſome Plants of <hi>Chaſſelas-Grapes</hi> among other Fruits, but that never happens, but when 'tis to garniſh ſome part of a <hi>Wall</hi> that is extreamly high, with deſign to have ſome ſtock of it ſhoot ſtrait up to a certain heighth, to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruit can ſeldom ever reach, which is not ordinary; nay, I care not to uſe my dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Muſcat-Grapes</hi> in that Service, becauſe they ripen not ſo well when raiſed upon high Trails, as <hi>Chaſſelas</hi> do.</p>

                        <p>Nature which ſeems to have taken pleaſure by the production of ſo many delicious <note place="margin">The praiſes of that Fruit.</note> Fruits, to demonſtrate how far the extent of its Ingenious Fecundity could go towards Abſolute Perfection, has ſufficiently ſhewn by the admirable temper wherewith ſhe has Enobled <hi>Grapes,</hi> that ſhe had not yet Exhauſted the Treaſures of her Rich Invention in the making of other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> but that whilſt ſhe was deſigning to enrich Mankind with ſuch important and valuable Preſents as thoſe, ſhe was pleaſed to reſerve ſomething more ſingular for the honour of the <hi>Vine,</hi> and to ſhew in it as 'twere a Maſter-piece of her ſurpriſing Art.

She does much more than that, for ſometimes ſhe has the Complaiſance not to Envy the Boldneſs of ſome Curious Perſons that undertake to imitate her, or even to ſurpaſs her in ſome very extraordinary things; ſhe takes it not ill, that ſome People not content to ſee their Care and Labour ſucceed in the Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Grapes</hi> of their own Country, that is to ſay, <hi>Chaſſelas, Cioutat, Morillons, Gennetins,</hi> and even <hi>Muſcats,</hi> &amp;c. venture to tranſplant into Climates that are pretty Cold, thoſe <hi>Vine-Plants</hi> ſhe deſigned only for the hotter Countrys: Nay, ſhe diſdains not to favour their Induſtry, by aſſiſting them to bring ſome of them to Maturity in ſome parts where ſhe her ſelf would never have thought of producing any. But yet as Liberal and Beneficent as ſhe is, it ſeems ſhe thought it would be too much againſt her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if ſhe ſhould be ſo eaſie as to ſuffer all the <hi>Grapes</hi> of <hi>Egypt, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp;c. to Ripen in the Countries Neighbouring on the <hi>North;</hi> it's true indeed, we endeavour all we can, by the help of our <hi>Walls</hi> that are moſt advantageouſly expoſed, to procure as much Heat as is required for the <hi>Paſſe-Muſquee,</hi> or <hi>Paſſing-Musk-Grape,</hi> the <hi>Pergoleſe,</hi> the <hi>Damask,</hi> and the <hi>Marroquins,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>Let us now return to lay down directions, what Methods are to be uſed, to give our <hi>Grapes</hi> all the means poſſible to attain in our Country that Perfection which they natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould have; upon which head, we tell you, we have nothing more Sovereign for that, than the moſt advantageous <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of our <hi>Walls,</hi> and for that reaſon, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation here to be terminated, we ought to make it our care to treat them well, and demonſtrate by that, how much eſteem we have for their excelling Merit.</p>

                        <p>And indeed a <hi>White Muſcat,</hi> or <hi>Muſcatell,</hi> whether its <hi>Grape</hi> be ſmall or great, 'tis no matter, ſo it be Clear, Firm, Yellow, Hard, and Crackling, and its Juice Sweet, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, <note place="margin">Here are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed all the good qualities of an excellent <hi>Grape.</hi>

                        <p>It is very true, there is nothing comparable to a good <hi>Peach</hi> in the Months of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, September,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> and even in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> till the Froſts come; but we can have but few of them here, unleſs it be againſt <hi>Walls,</hi> which is a ſenſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to us all, becauſe in the open Air they become incomparably better than againſt <hi>Walls.</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48210:98"/>
of ſituation, a degree of Goodneſs, which the violent ardour of the Sun reflected againſt a Wall, could never be able to give them equally on all parts of their Circference. The experience we have of theſe ſingular good effects of the full Air, has made me to think of raiſing a kind of cavelling objection againſt Wall-Plantations; for though I know indeed for certain, that 'tis they that contribute to the inſuring us a crop of Fruit, yet I know as certainly at the ſame time, that 'tis they that by cramping up our Fruits againſt a Wall, and thereby depriving them of the free enjoyment of the Air, hinder them from acquiring the full Goodneſs they naturally would have, as if thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> out of a Senſe of impatience and indignation at the violence and torture they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by being ſo tyed and crampt up, had a mind to puniſh us by a ſuppreſſion of ſome part of their Goodneſs, for the injury we do them in robbing them of that liberty which Nature had bleſt them withal.</p>
                        <p>In the Spring time then, I take advantage of the aſſiſtance of the Wall, to make <note place="margin">How to draw out the bearing Branches to give the Fruit the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the open Air till they are ripe.</note> the Peaches knit, and take the more ſurely, and at Midſummer I draw the Branches with Fruit on them forwards from the Wall, which after my manner of Pruning, I leave long, and with Props which I ſix deep in the <hi>Earth,</hi> I ſupport and keep tight and firm thoſe Branches ſo laden with their Fruit, which by that Artifice, acquires that goodneſs which the open Air only can give it, and which we have newly deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, there is ſome Subjection and Pains required to do this well, and the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and beauty of our Wall-Plantation is thereby a little disfigured whilſt the Fruit is on the <hi>Trees,</hi> ſo that the Eyes of all Perſons that look upon it, are not ſo well pleaſed as <note place="margin">The effect of that Method.</note> otherwiſe, but that fault is amply recompenſed, as well by the beauty of the colour, and the ſmoothneſs of the Skin, as by that rich taſte in the Fruit, which cannot be had otherwiſe. And as ſoon as the Fruit is gathered, the Branches are put back again to the Wall, and faſtned in the ſame places they were in before, ſo that no Body can ſee they have been ever medled with. I could not forbear mentioning here this Fancy I have had for Branches ſo drawn forward.</p>
                        <p>It is certain then, that almoſt all ſorts of <hi>Peaches</hi> placed in the full Air, in ſuch kind of high fenced City <hi>Gardens,</hi> as we have mentioned, ſo luckily hit to produce ſuch rare and delicious Fruit, that one would think it grew in ſome enchanted place, rather than in a <hi>Garden</hi> cultivated by human Art. There are only ſome <hi>Avant-Peaches</hi> or <hi>Forward-Peaches,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">What <hi>Peaches</hi> will not ſuffer that method, and why.</note> 
                           <hi>Troy-Peaches, White-Maudlins,</hi> and backward <hi>Violet-Peaches,</hi> which are not ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as the reſt.

                        <p>But to return to the purſuit of the Conteſtation of Fruits, concerning the point of Precedence in Wall-Plantations.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe any Body would offer to put up <hi>Pears</hi> here to pretend to Precedence in the good places in diſpute, to the prejudice of the <hi>Muſcat-grapes, Peaches, Figgs,</hi> &amp;c. (whatever merits <hi>Pears</hi> may otherwiſe have, and which we readily acknowledge in them, and particularly in the Boncretiens that are fair, large, long, and coloured with a lovely red) for we have other Fruits that undoubtedly far excell them, much leſs ſtill will any pretend to propoſe in this Diſpute, either <hi>Apricocks,</hi> or <hi>Early Cherries,</hi> or <hi>Azerolls</hi> or <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Haws.</hi> They would have the diſgrace of a repulſe, if they ſhould engage them in it, but we ſhall do all of them that honour which is their due, when their turn comes, ſo that their Protectors, if there ſhould appear any to put in any ſuch claim for them, ſhall have no reaſon to be diſcontent.</p>
                        <p>There are few perſons that have yet thought of declaring in favour of good <hi>Plums</hi> in this Conteſtation, I do not ſay all ſorts of <hi>Plums,</hi> but only four or five of the beſt ſorts, <note place="margin">The Authours Plea for, and Commendation of Choice <hi>Plums.</hi>
                           </note> and that may perhaps be, becauſe they have not yet proved with what incomparable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, what exquiſite taſte, and what ſugred ſweetneſs <hi>Wall-Plums</hi> are enriched, not only in compariſon of thoſe of their own Kind, that grow in the open Air, but even of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits; a difference very ſurprizing in it ſelf, but ſtill more when we conſider how difficult it is to render a good reaſon, why a Wall ſhould produce ſo contrary an effect <note place="margin">The <hi>wall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a better effect in <hi>Plums</hi> than in other Fruit.</note> in <hi>Plums,</hi> to what it do's in other Fruits, it being very certain, that <hi>Plums</hi> very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably improve in goodneſs by the Wall, whereas other Fruits no leſs conſiderably impair theirs in the ſame ſituation.</p>

Perhaps, I would put my ſelf willingly at the head of thoſe Gentlemen that in the preſent Competition, would be for giving to the good <hi>Wall-Plums,</hi> the Precedence before all other Fruits.</p>
                        <p>And to make good my Cauſe, I would readily produce a Basket full of good <hi>Violet-Perdigon-Plums</hi> full ripe, and curiouſly dewed or flower'd, mixed with ſome white <hi>Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> ſome St. <hi>Catharine Plums,</hi> and ſome <hi>Apricock-Plums,</hi> being well aſſured that the eyes of all the Spectators would be much moved to favour my Plea, by ſo lovely a ſight, that their taſte would almoſt convince them of its Juſtice; and in fine, that all that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me a great many Backers, and make my party conſiderably ſtrong.</p>

                           </note> Proverb from it, to expreſs the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all that may be good). But the <hi>Musk-Melon</hi> has nothing to do here, it's Buſineſs is to creep on the <hi>Earth,</hi> whereas our diſpute here is only among thoſe Fruits which may be brought to any perfection by us in Wall-Plantations.</p>
                        <p>A good <hi>Fig</hi> then is that which above all Fruit deſerves among us the beſt place in a Wall-Plantation, (though in hot Countries, a Wall might incommode it.) But to Judge by outward appearances both of its excellency, and by conſequence, of the high eſteem it deſerves, we need but only obſerve the ſhrugging up of the Shoulders, and the motion of the Eye-brows of thoſe that eat them, and what great quantities of them may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without at all indangering the Health. <note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, it has the advantage to bear twice a year, that is to ſay firſt, in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which firſt <hi>Figs</hi> are called <hi>Fig-Flowers;</hi> and the ſecond time in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>

                              <hi>Fig-trees</hi> bear twice a year. The firſt <hi>Figs</hi> called <hi>Fig-flowers,</hi> and the others <hi>ſecond Figs.</hi>
                           </note> and <hi>October,</hi> which are called <hi>Second Figs.</hi> This Advantage, I ſay, is of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful importance to the maintaining them in the firſt Rank, which they ſo rightfully ought to Poſſeſs.</p>
                        <p>I might here tell you by the way this truth, that among the ſecond ones, thoſe which ripen in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> before there come any Froſt, have in my Opinion, <note place="margin">The latter <hi>Figs</hi> beſt, and why.</note> both a more ſugred pulp, and a richer taſte, and conſequently are better, though a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſſer than the firſt, the reaſon of which is palpable enough, it being becauſe the <hi>September Figs</hi> were formed in the faireſt Seaſon of the Year, and nouriſhed with a juice well concocted, and wrought up to a great Perfection; whereas the <hi>Fig-Flowers</hi> have had all the cold, and all the Rain of the Spring-time to weather, and go through; which are two no very favourable Circumſtances to any Fruits, for their acquiring a ſugred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and exquiſite taſte.</p>
                        <p>I know ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Figs</hi> that probably are all good in hot Countries, becauſe they all ripen there, but we in this Country have but two ſorts, which may properly be ſaid to <note place="margin">But two ſorts of <hi>Figs</hi> excellent in <hi>France,</hi> viz. the <hi>great round,</hi> and <hi>great long white Figs.</hi> The <hi>long</hi> beſt, and why.</note> be admirable, and they are the <hi>Great White ones,</hi> of which ſome are <hi>Round,</hi> and ſome <hi>Long.</hi> The <hi>Round</hi> ones come in more abundance, and the <hi>Long</hi> ones are eſpecially moſt admirable about the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they can attain to their due Ripeneſs, becauſe they are not ſo ſubject to ſplit and chap towards their Crown, as the <hi>Round</hi> ones are: Which fault ordinarily proceeds from ſome hot Rains that fall in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> that make thoſe poor <hi>Round Figs</hi> ſo ſwell, that they gape towards the head, with Clefts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fright one, and thereby vent and let out all their ſweetneſs and perfume; ſo that the <hi>Long</hi> ones which are of better proof againſt thoſe Rains than the <hi>Round</hi> ones, have in truth at that time a moſt Exquiſite and Miraculous Taſt, which the others have quite loſt.</p>
                        <p>I have had againſt one <hi>Southern-Fruit-Wall,</hi> Twelve or Fifteen ſorts of <hi>Figs,</hi> all of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, to convince me that in this Country we ought aſſuredly to keep only to the <note place="margin">Compared with other <hi>Figs.</hi>

                        <p>In this liſt of <hi>Peaches, Brugnons,</hi> or <hi>Nectarins,</hi> and <hi>Pavies,</hi> there are reckoned thirty two very different ſorts of <hi>Peaches;</hi> three very different ſorts of <hi>Brugnons</hi> or <hi>Nectarins,</hi> and ſeven ſorts of <hi>Pavies,</hi> likewiſe extremely differently. I need not tell the People of this Country, that we call <hi>Peaches</hi> thoſe which ſeparate from their <hi>Stone,</hi> our Country Men here abouts knowing it well enough, though the <hi>Gaſcons, Languedocians,</hi> and People of <hi>Provence,</hi> and in general, all the curious Gentlemen of <hi>Guienne</hi> know it not ſo well; but it is neceſſary to tell all the World, that we call <note n="*" place="margin">

But as for the great number of the pretended Males they talk of, it is altogether unknown to me; not but that I have ſufficiently employed all my Endeavours to diſcover more of them than the eight ſorts
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48210:100"/>
above mentioned; perhaps the race of them may be kept ſtill in <hi>Perſia,</hi> from whence they pretend all <hi>Peaches</hi> firſt came, yet without bringing along with them that mortal quality ſome would make us believe they have there, or if they will needs have the <hi>Pavies</hi> to have all come out of that Country, thoſe which we have not here, muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt have been drowned in the long Seas by the way. I am particularly ſorry for thoſe that would have been extream forward to ripen in our Climates, we ſhould be very happy if we could repair the loſs of them, ſuppoſing that ever any ſuch loſs we had.</p>
                        <p>I know well enough too, there are ſome curious Perſons, that reckon up more ſorts <note place="margin">The vanity of ſome People of multiplying ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies without Grounds.</note> of Stone Fruits than we have counted above; I am willing to grant, they may know ſome that I know not; but at leaſt, let them be pleaſed to let me tell them, that after a very great and very long continued exactneſs in ſearching, I never could find any more, and I will add, that as great a Liberty has been taken in multiplying the names of <hi>Peaches,</hi> as well as thoſe of other Fruits, and that the leaſt difference, either in Flower and Colour, or in bigneſs and ſhape, or in the time of their ripeneſs, or in the taſte and delicacy of their Juyce, has always given, and ſtill gives many People an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fancy, to pretend they have ſome new particular ſort of <hi>Peach,</hi> upon which they fail not to Baptize it with a new Name.</p>
                        <p>O unlucky itching humour, which mayſt properly enough be named, the daughter of Vanity or Ignorance, how great a Confuſion doſt thou occaſion to us among our Fruits! Is it poſſible People ſhould not know that a difference in <hi>Soils,</hi> in <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> or in <hi>Climates,</hi> or in the tempers of <hi>Seaſons,</hi> is able to produce thoſe little Varieties in Fruits, which yet are not eſſential? Notwithſtanding which, they have given me an infinite deal of Pains to diſcover the truth. I ſhall now with my ordinary Ingenuity, tell you what I think of them, though with the hazard of incurring the diſpleaſure of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Nurſery Mongers.</p>
                        <p>I am very far from deſiring to ſuppreſs any ſort of good Fruit, ſince in all places as far as my Curioſity and Acquaintance extends, I always indefatigably labour to diſcover ſome new kinds that are good, with deſign to multiply and propagate them as ſoon as they come to my Knowledge. But likewiſe on the other ſide, inſtead of deſiring to form Chimera's and imaginary and notional beings, though never ſo pleaſing to the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by multiplying of Names for the leaſt inconſiderable differences, I oppoſe that ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſe with all the vigour and ſincerity I poſſibly can; and though I have reckoned up thirty two ſorts of <hi>Peaches,</hi> yet I do not therefore ſay, there are thirty two ſorts of good ones, ſo good as I would deſire them, in my <hi>Garden,</hi> or counſel my Friends to plant them in theirs; no, in that number there are ſome which we may truly pronounce not to be good, and accordingly I ſhall baniſh them, as much as poſſible from our Plantations: But likewiſe, though of any one kind, ſome ſhould ſometimes prove bad, we ought not preſently to conclude, that the whole kind is therefore bad. Let us now conſider ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in what conſiſts the excellency of ſome, and the meanneſs or badneſs of ſome others of them, that we may be ſo much the better able to judge upon ſolid <hi>Grounds,</hi> which are to be received and multiplyed, and which, proſcribed and entirely debarr'd of all claims to the choice places in our Wall Plantations.</p>

                           <p>Of the excellency of <hi>Peaches,</hi> and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THe excellency of <hi>Peaches</hi> conſiſts in the good qualities they ought naturally to have.</p>
                        <p>Of which the firſt is, to have their pulp a little firm, ſo as it may be juſt perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">The good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Peaches.</hi> The firſt good quality.</note> and no more, and very fine withall, which ought to appear when their skin is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, which ſhould be fine, ſhining and yellow, without any thing of green, and eaſy to ſtrip off, which if it do's not, the <hi>Peach</hi> is not ripe. This Excellence further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears when we cut a <hi>Peach</hi> with the Knife, which is, in my Opinion the firſt thing to be <note place="margin">A remark in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Peach.</hi>
                           </note> done to them at Table, by any one that would eat them delightfully, and with a true reliſh, and then we may ſee all along where the Knife has paſt, as 'twere an infinite number of little Springs, which are methinks, the prettieſt things in the World to look upon. They that open a <hi>Peach</hi> otherwiſe, oftentimes loſing half that delicious Juice that makes them to be ſo highly eſteemed by all the World.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48210:101"/>
The ſecond good quality of a <hi>Peach</hi> is, that its Pulp melts as ſoon as 'tis in the Mouth; <note place="margin">The ſecond good quality.</note> for indeed, the pulp of <hi>Peaches</hi> is properly nothing but a congealed water, which diſſolves into a liquid form, when 'tis never ſo little preſs'd by the Teeth or any thing elſe. In the third place, that water or juice in melting, ought to be ſweet and ſugred, and of a <note place="margin">The third good quality.</note> rich, high, and vinous taſte, and in ſome kinds of them, a little musked; I would have alſo their Stone little, and that thoſe <hi>Peaches</hi> which are not ſmooth, be only covered with a reaſonable proportion of ſoft Down, much hairineſs being a certain mark of the want <note place="margin">The fourth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification.</note> of competent goodneſs in a <hi>Peach,</hi> that hair uſually falling almoſt quite off, in good <hi>Peaches,</hi> and particularly in thoſe which grow in the open Air.</p>
                        <p>In fine, I ſhould count it one of the principal qualities of a good <hi>Peach</hi> to be large, if we had not ſome little ones that are marvellouſly excellent; as for Example, the <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The fifth qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> the <hi>Red Alberges,</hi> and the <hi>Violet-Peaches.</hi> However, it is at leaſt ſo far true, that if the <hi>Peaches</hi> which ſhould be large, come ſhort of the bigneſs they ſhould have, or much exceed it, they prove always bad; and perhaps it has been pertinently enough ſaid by ſome, that theſe laſt were <hi>Dropſical,</hi> and the others <hi>Hectical,</hi> or <hi>Conſumptive.</hi> The <hi>Hecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ones have much more Stone and leſs Pulp than they ſhould have, and the <hi>Dropſical</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Two faults in the bigneſs. Diſtinguiſht into <hi>Hectical</hi> and <hi>Dropſical,</hi> and their Deſcription.</note> ones have their Stone open and gaping, and a hollow between their Stone and Pulp, which Pulp is alſo courſe, and groſs, and tough, and its juice ſharp or bitter.</p>
                        <p>And in reality, as I have ſaid, there is none but the <hi>Peaches</hi> that grow in the open Air, which have all theſe good qualities in a Sovereign Degree, with ſomething of I know not what exalted taſte, which 'tis impoſſible to deſcribe. The <hi>Peaches</hi> indeed that grow on <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> have ſome Proportion of them, but not to that degree, in which we juſt now obſerved thoſe growing in the open Air ſo much excell, unleſs it be thoſe that grow upon Branches, which I order to be drawn from the Wall, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have above explained.</p>

In the fifth place, 'tis a fault to have a hard skin, as the <hi>Nipple-Peaches;</hi> and ſixthly, <note place="margin">The fifth, and ſixth.</note> 'tis another fault to be ſometimes ſo <hi>Vinous,</hi> as to contract from thence a <hi>Vinegariſh</hi> ſharp taſte.</p>
                        <p>And now it can be no hard matter to judge of good <hi>Peaches,</hi> and amongſt the good ones, to judge which are the beſt, no more than to judge which are bad, and among thoſe bad ones, to judge which are the worſt.</p>
                        <p>It is certain that all the <hi>Peaches</hi> of one certain kind, do not always prove ſo perfect as they naturally ought; no, nor all the <hi>Peaches</hi> of the ſame Tree neither, are not of an equal goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>We have already told you that 'tis a great fault in them to be too big or too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; <note place="margin">Seventhly, Another fault to come ſhort or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ripeneſs.

                        </p>
                        <p>There are two things that ſeem to me to be wiſhed for in <hi>Plums;</hi> Firſt, that they would come in before the ſeaſon of <hi>Peaches;</hi> that is to ſay, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> becauſe then they would be much more advantageous and helpful to us, than by coming as they do almoſt all in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that is to ſay, together with the <hi>Peaches,</hi> but our wiſhes in that point are but in vain; however they maintain their <hi>Ground</hi> with them, with ſuch marvellous good Grace and Gallantry, that they come off with Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>In were to be wiſhed in the ſecond place, that all the good <hi>Plums</hi> would eleverly quit <note place="margin">Moſt <hi>Plums</hi> quit not their Stones whether good or bad.</note> their Stones, and yet we muſt e'en have patience in this Caſe too, when the <hi>Wall-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigons</hi> though ripe, and at their higheſt Perfection, yet cleave extream faſt to their Stones, and the <hi>Roche-Courbons,</hi> which are the ſweeteſt and moſt ſugred <hi>Plums</hi> we have, will not at all part from them.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo a great many bad ones that quit not their Stones, as for Example, the <hi>Black-Bull's-Eye,</hi> the <hi>Amber-Plum,</hi> the <hi>Moyeu's,</hi> the <hi>Ilvert,</hi> the St. <hi>Julian,</hi> the <hi>Norbett,</hi> the <hi>Caſtellan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that quit them eaſilieſt, are almoſt all the <hi>Damask-Plums,</hi> of which the number <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Damask Plums</hi> quit their Stoues caſilieſt.</note> is great, or at leaſt the number of the Names People give them upon the leaſt little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the World.</p>
                        <p>From all the good qualities of <hi>Plums</hi> that I have above noted, I conclude conformably to my Experience. That there are but four or five ſorts of <hi>Plums,</hi> which deſerve to be <note place="margin">But four or five ſorts, fit to be planted by <hi>Walls,</hi> and which they are. Empreſſes and <hi>Mirabelles,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſometimes, and why.</note> admitted to the honour of the <hi>Wall,</hi> namely the two <hi>Perdrigons, White</hi> and <hi>Violet,</hi> the St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> the <hi>Apricock-Plum,</hi> and the <hi>Roche-Courbon.</hi> However we add to them ſome <hi>Empreſſes,</hi> and ſome <hi>Mirabelles</hi> too, if we pleaſe, but it muſt not be ſo much in Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have them better upon <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> than otherwiſe, becauſe they are ſeldom or never eaten raw, as to have them the more certainly come to good, becauſe they, as well as moſt other <hi>Plums</hi> are ſubject to miſcarry in the Bloſſom, and that yet it is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that we ſhould have ſome of theſe laſt to make uſe of in the <hi>Compotes</hi> and wet ſweet-meats of the Seaſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48210:103"/>
As faſt as I ſhall diſpoſe of each ſort of <hi>Plum,</hi> I will give a little deſcription of it, as well of thoſe we ſhall plant by <hi>Walls,</hi> as of thoſe which we ſhall rear upon <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Standards.</hi> For in fine, I intend to have of them in all manner of Situations where the <hi>Ground</hi> will permit me, but yet always taking care to place every one of them in that Situation which is moſt agreeable to them.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing to ſay againſt the <hi>Haſting</hi> or <hi>Early Cherries,</hi> there is but one ſort of them that I know of; It is in the novelty of the Fruit, coming in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> more than in any thing elſe that their Excellence conſiſts, whether it be to ſerve them up raw, or in <hi>Compotes</hi> or wet Sweet-meats; for otherwiſe to be ſowre, to have but little Pulp, a large Stone, and a thick Skin, could certainly be no Qualities to render them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry recommendable: And 'tis this Novelty that will oblige us to plant ſome <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> of them, when we have Walling enough to ſpare them.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall likewiſe plant there ſome <hi>Corinthian-Grapes,</hi> which is a ſmall berried <hi>Grape,</hi> of a ſweet and moſt delicious juice, of which there are two or three Colours; as alſo ſome <hi>Chaſſelas,</hi> which I prize much in this Country, as well for the Beauty of the <hi>Grape,</hi> and its Berry or Grain, as for the ſweetneſs of its very much ſugred juice, but above all, for its great eaſineſs in being brought to bear, and to ripen, in which they almoſt never fail us, whereas the <hi>Muſcat</hi> can hardly ever arrive here to that Point of ripeneſs, unleſs it be in ſuch another hot and long <hi>Summer,</hi> as was that of the Year 1676.</p>
                        <p>I have little to ſay about <hi>Apricocks;</hi> all the World is well enough acquainted with their Taſt, Colour, Shape and Bigneſs; and do indeed make ſome account of them, but it <note place="margin">The Authors ſenſe about <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricocks.</hi>
                           </note> is only to make uſe of in Sweet-meats as well dry as wet, it being not a very delicious Fruit to eat raw in any great quantity; yet in the <hi>Gardens,</hi> in the time of their being ripe, we find Pleaſure enough in gathering here and there one, to eat upon the Spot.</p>
                        <p>There grow pretty good ones upon great <hi>Standard Trees,</hi> upon which they grow all tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Standard <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks</hi> beſt.</note> and ſpeckled with little red ſpots that recreate the Sight, and ſtir up the Appetite with a much richer and more exquiſite taſt than they have upon <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi> But then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe, <note place="margin">The Wall-ones larger and fairer.</note> the <hi>VVall</hi> augments their bigneſs, and gives them an admirable Vermilion, and principally, it ſecures us of a more certain crop of them. But both ſorts of them are equally good for preſerving; the beſt of them are a little ſugred, but yet moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a ſubſtance too like Dough. There are few <hi>Gardens</hi> where there muſt not be ſome one <hi>Tree</hi> of them. This Fruit is early; that is, it begins to appear at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>July,</hi> and eſpecially a ſmall ſort called the <hi>Haſting Apricock,</hi> and which muſt <note place="margin">The little July <hi>Haſting</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Apricock.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Ordinary Apricocks</hi> which are much larger, and have a Yellow Pulp, ripen not <note place="margin">The <hi>Common</hi> and larger one, about Mid <hi>July.</hi>
                           </note> till about the Middle of <hi>July;</hi> we muſt have ſome of them in every one of the four <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> if we have Walling enough to ſpare, or otherwiſe we may chance to want wherewithall to make the beſt of all our <hi>Compotes,</hi> or wet Sweet-meats, a thing that is very ſurpriſing to conſider, that Fire and Sugar ſhould be able to raiſe up and awaken in an <hi>Apricock</hi> when preſerved, a certain perfume which was not perceivable, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie Dormant while it was raw.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon why I would have ſome of them planted in all ſorts of <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> is, becauſe, putting forth their Bloſſoms very early, that is, in the middle of <hi>March,</hi> a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon much traverſed with white hoar Froſts, which are of mortal influence to their Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, from what ſide ſoever the cold wind comes to blow full upon them; it certainly freezes and nips thoſe Bloſſoms dead, and lets but few of them eſcape, and becauſe the Winds that reign in the <hi>Spring,</hi> do not every year blow full upon all the four Walls of a Garden, that which ſhall happen not to be afflicted with their pernicious Blaſts, may at leaſt recompenſe us for the loſs our Trees may have ſuffered on other ſides; and by this means, ſometimes we have had of theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> on the <hi>North-ſide</hi> Wall of our Gardens, when we could have none neither on the <hi>Eaſtern, Southern,</hi> nor <hi>Weſtern</hi> Quarters, and ſometimes the happy ſide is only on the <hi>South,</hi> ſometimes on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, only on the <hi>Weſt.</hi> And therefore as far as our convenience will permit us, we ſhould venture ſome Trees in all the ſeveral <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> that we may not fail in one or other of them, to have ſome <hi>Apricocks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if there knit too great a number of them, as it often happens, we muſt not fail to pluck a great many of them, being aſſured of this Satisfaction, that they will not be <note place="margin">No green <hi>Fruit</hi> ſo good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks.</hi>
                           </note> loſt as thoſe commonly are which we are forced to take away ſmall and green, of other <hi>Fruits;</hi> but that they may be employed in making green <hi>Compotes,</hi> or wet <hi>Sweet-meats,</hi>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48210:103"/>
and dry ones too, and all of them ſo very good, as we ſhould hardly dare, without the encouragement of experience, to hope they could be.</p>
                        <p>In the Country of <hi>Anjou</hi> we have commonly a little ſort of <hi>Apricock,</hi> with a Kernel ſo ſweet, that one would almoſt take them for <hi>Filberts,</hi> and accordingly we often crack <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Anjou Sweet Kernel'd Apricock.</note> the Stones for to eat them. This ſort of <hi>Apricock</hi> has a white Pulp, and is very good in that Country, but they moſt of them grow on <hi>Standard Trees,</hi> and that is it which has ſo well eſtabliſhed the Reputation of their Goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>In very hot Years, ſuch as was the Year 1676. if there chance to remain any <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,</hi> for any long time upon our <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> they acquire there almoſt the ſame Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they do when they are preſerved, after they have quite loſt a certain ſharpneſs which is natural to them, as we have proved to our great Surprize.</p>
                        <p>Having then ran through and examined all the ſeveral ſorts of Fruits that are fit to be employed in ſtocking our <hi>Wall-Plantations,</hi> let us now diſpoſe of them againſt our Walls, in that Order of Rank and Precedence, as their greater or leſſer Excellencies ſhall deſerve; in order to which, let me tell you,</p>
                        <p>That I will call a good <hi>Expoſition,</hi> Firſt, that which is poſited towards the <hi>South,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is commonly the beſt, or at leaſt that which makes Fruits moſt forward. <note place="margin">The ſeveral <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> repeated.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Secondly, that which is towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which I eſteem almoſt as much as the preceeding one.</p>
                        <p>And I ſhall call a midling or indifferent <hi>Expoſition,</hi> that which is towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and a <hi>bad</hi> one, that which is towards the <hi>North.</hi> This being laid down as a <hi>Ground,</hi> my <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fig-trees,</hi> where to be placed.</note> Advice is, that if a Gentleman has but never ſo ſmall a Proportion of the good <hi>Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that he ſhould plant a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> there of the <hi>White Round</hi> ſort, which of all <hi>Figs,</hi> is, without Contradiction, the beſt, and ſince whatever it coſt, it is neceſſary to have a few <hi>Figs,</hi> he can never chooſe a better ſort than that. This Wall-<hi>Fig-tree</hi> alone will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the extent of ten or twelve foot of Wall.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe the leaſt <hi>Gardens,</hi> to have at leaſt five Toiſes or Fathoms extent of Wall on <note place="margin">The regulation of <hi>Wall-trees</hi> in a little <hi>Garden</hi> of the extent of ten Toiſes or Fathoms at one ſide, and a little more on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> one ſide, and a little more on another, ſo that in a <hi>Garden</hi> ſuppoſed to have about twenty four yards of <hi>Good Expoſition,</hi> as well towards the <hi>Eaſt</hi> as <hi>South,</hi> ten or twelve of <hi>midling</hi> or <hi>indifferent,</hi> and eight or ten of <hi>bad,</hi> I would have firſt placed in the <hi>good</hi> one a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> and that ſhould be juſt at the corner joyning the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wall; that is the place I deſign in all <hi>Gardens</hi> for the <hi>Fig-trees,</hi> as being the beſt to defend them from the <hi>North</hi> Winds, and from the <hi>Galern,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>North North-Weſt</hi> Wind, which reigns commonly in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> which is the time of the putting forth of the firſt <hi>Figs</hi> called <hi>Fig-Flowers,</hi> and becauſe at that Seaſon, this Wind is ſeldom without Froſts, it moſt unmercifully deſtroys thoſe poor little Infant-<hi>Figs,</hi> which being very tender, as being but newly born, are not able to reſiſt the rigour of a Froſt, for the united ſhelter of thoſe two Walls of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> meeting in one corner, is able to guard them from the Violence of that their Enemy; however I do not mean, that the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> ſhould be always placed juſt in the very corner, but near it, whether it be by the <hi>South</hi> Wall if there be one, or by the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> one, if the other be wanting.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> is placed, there may perhaps remain ſtill to us in that little <hi>Garden,</hi> about twenty yards of good Walling, ſuppoſing one of the good ſides be not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the facing of a Building, or in Rails, which is ordinary enough, in which caſe, the number of our good <hi>Expoſitions</hi> will be ſo much leſſened, and our number of <hi>Trees</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But at leaſt, if by good chance, that Building or piece of Rails, happen to be on the <hi>Weſtern</hi> or <hi>Northern</hi> ſide, there will ſtill remain to us, as I have juſt now ſaid, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty yards of good Walling, and that ſhall ſerve for ſix <hi>Trees,</hi> allowing eight Foot extent to each <hi>Tree,</hi> according to our aboveſaid Regulation, upon this Suppoſition, that the Walls of all ſorts of incloſures ſhould be about nine foot high; and of theſe ſix <hi>Trees,</hi> I adviſe there may be five <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and one <hi>Violet Perdrigron Plum-Tree.</hi> I name firſt the ſive <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> becauſe commonly there is hardly any Body that has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little a <hi>Garden,</hi> but abſolutely reſolves to have ſome <hi>Peaches</hi> whatſoever elſe he wants, and if there be room for ſeven or eight <hi>Trees,</hi> I think any Gentleman would be much in <note place="margin">A deſcription of the <hi>Violet Perdri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon Plum.</hi>
                           </note> the wrong not to place among them one <hi>Violet Perdrigon Plum-tree,</hi> that he may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſome of thoſe beautiful <hi>Plums</hi> that are reaſonably large and long, and ſo well flouriſhed over their reddiſh Violet colour, with a charming Dew, and are ſo marvellouſly delicious for their fine Pulp, ſugred Juice, and rich and high Taſte; and this <hi>Plum-tree</hi> muſt be ſure to have too one of the firſt places about the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> or otherwiſe, no pleaſure can be expected from it. We ſhall alſo place here ſome certain ſorts of <hi>Peaches</hi> with it, which may agree better thant hat does, with an <hi>Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> but indifferently good.</p>

                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48210:104"/>
Let us examine then ſeriouſly which ought to be thoſe five Favourite ſorts of <hi>Peach-trees</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The choice <hi>Peach-trees</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> we are to plant here, to fill up with the beſt advantage the little room we have.</p>
                        <p>I am not for any of thoſe that bring ſmall <hi>Peaches,</hi> though the <hi>Troy-Peach</hi> be to my liking, one of the beſt that can grow, it being better to ſtay a little longer before we begin to have <hi>Peaches</hi> in our little <hi>Garden,</hi> that we may begin with the large Stones at the very firſt; and beſides, we muſt have here ſuch as are moſt certain and conſtant in bearing, and are leaſt ſubject to be poſter'd with <hi>Ants,</hi> and by that Rule, the <hi>White, Maudlins</hi> will likewiſe be excluded for their ſmallneſs, as well as thoſe of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Violet Haſting Peach,</hi> is in truth, the beſt of all <hi>Peaches,</hi> it is that which has the moſt delicious and perfumed Pulp, and the moſt vinous, rich, and noble taſte of all them, and that which with good right, might claim the firſt place, both here and every where elſe, but that it is not large enough. The <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> has almoſt all the good qualities that can be deſired, and has no bad ones; It produces a goodly <hi>Tree,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Admirable Peach deſcribed.</note> is one of our roundeſt and largeſt <hi>Peaches;</hi> it is of a lovely Colour, and has a firm, fine, and melting Pulp, a ſweet and ſugred Juice, and a vinous, rich, and exquiſite taſte; it has but a ſmall Stone, and is not ſubject to degenerate into a Doughy Subſtance; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a long time upon the <hi>Tree</hi> to delight the Eye, ripens about <hi>Mid-September,</hi> and is of great increaſe, that is to ſay in a Word, it is one of the moſt accompliſhed <hi>Peaches</hi> we know, and therefore I would by no means plant any <hi>Garden</hi> without ſome <hi>Tree</hi> of this, and of the <hi>Violet Peach</hi> too. But if I had room but for one of the two, I ſhould without doubt preferr the <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> before the other, though the <hi>Violet Peach</hi> do really excell it in Goodneſs, but I ſhould take the contrary reſolution if they were both of an equal bigneſs. This <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> grows kindly enough in <hi>Midling Expoſitions,</hi> but yet ſtill better in <hi>good</hi> ones, and therefore to manage well the little room we have, it is better to place this <hi>Peach</hi> near the <hi>Northern Expoſition,</hi> than any of all the other kinds, and where ever we have convenience to plant two or three <hi>Trees</hi> of it, it will be beſt to ſeparate them by placing one in each <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and always to contrive to have one of them at leaſt in a good Situation, that ſo we may take advantage of experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what this kind is able to do in all of them.</p>
                        <p>I have here two things more to ſay concerning this <hi>Peach,</hi> which I have no mind nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forget, nor to put off to another place. The firſt is, that contrary to the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im I have above laid down, the <hi>Admirable Peaches</hi> that ripen laſt upon the <hi>Tree</hi> are the beſt, they having had the time that <hi>Peaches</hi> need for the acquiring of a perfect maturity, for they are not Fruits to ripen or mellow off of their <hi>Trees,</hi> though one may keep them three or four days without ſpoiling; where note, that unleſs its <hi>Tree</hi> be very vigorous, this <hi>Peach</hi> is very ſubject to fall off half ripe, greeniſh, and all downy, and then all the vinous and lively taſte it ſhould have, degenerates into bitterneſs and ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and its Pulp which ſhould be ſo fine and melting is courſe, and almoſt dry. In fine, its Stone is bigger than it ſhould be; nay, and ſometimes gapes, all very ill ſigns and Symptoms, which we ſee not in the Fruit of found <hi>Trees,</hi> and which never fail to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all <hi>Peaches</hi> that fall of themſelves before they be full ripe.</p>
                        <p>From whence I draw my ſecond Obſervation, which is, that when <hi>Trees</hi> have any of <note place="margin">How to cure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed <hi>Peach-trees.</hi>
                           </note> thoſe defects, we are to reckon no more upon them almoſt than if they were dead; in that caſe, we muſt prune and cut them very cloſe, to try if being reduced to a leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they will not ſhoot forth fairer and ſounder Branches, and conſequently bear better Fruit, and at the ſame time, we muſt put our Selves in a Condition to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſs we are like to have in thoſe diſeaſed Trees, by timely planting ſome good <hi>Tree</hi> of the ſame kind in the beſt place we can chooſe for it, without which ſeaſonable proviſion and precaution, we Shall run the hazard of languiſhing under the diſpleaſure of having for a long time nothing but Scurvy <hi>Peaches</hi> of that kind, which ſhould be the beſt in the World.</p>
                        <p>And ſince we have room here for five <hi>Peach-trees</hi> we muſt needs have the <hi>Minion,</hi> the <hi>Belle Chevreuſe,</hi> or <hi>Fair Chevreuſe,</hi> or <hi>Goat peach,</hi> and the <hi>Nivette,</hi> to be of the number, and accordingly we ſhall diſpoſe of our twelve <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms of Wall, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> has ſome very conſiderable advantages; for firſt, it is hardly inferiour <note place="margin">The <hi>Chevreuſe Peach</hi> further commended.</note> to any in largeneſs, in beauty of colour, in godly ſhape, which is a little longiſh, and in abundance of Sugred and well reliſh'd juice, and over and above all that, it further excells in the great increaſe it yields, ſo that with a great deal of Juſtice, I place it here for the <note place="margin">Its faults, and their cauſes.</note> fourth. It has no other fault, than that ſometimes its pulp grows Doughy, but it never contracts that fault but when it is let to ripen too much upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or when it grows in a cold and moiſt Soil, or when it meets with a <hi>Summer</hi> that is neither hot enough nor dry enough.

                        <p>The <hi>Nivette,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Velvet-peach,</hi> is likewiſe in my opinion, a very fair and large <hi>Peach;</hi> it has ſo fine a colour both within and without, that it is moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The <hi>Nivette</hi> or <hi>Velvet-peach</hi> deſcribed.

I do not place any <hi>Maudlin-peaches</hi> in this <hi>Expoſition</hi> neither, nor any <hi>Minions, Dandilli's Bellegardes,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thrive not there, and are all apt there to have a Pulp too much like Dough. This <hi>Purple-peach</hi> denotes its colour by one of its names, and the quality of its taſt by the other, and in effect, it is of a brown dark red colour, that penetrates pretty much into its Pulp. It is very round and indifferent large, its Pulp is pretty fine, and its taſte rich and exquiſite: In a word, it will very well maintain its place in this little <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The four <hi>Trees</hi> of the <hi>Northern Expoſition</hi> ſhall be <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> which ſhall be content <note place="margin">The Trees advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Expoſition. 4 Pear-trees,</hi> &amp;c.</note> with the diſtance of ſeven foot and a half from each other; and they ſhall be, one <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range green Pear,</hi> two <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> and one <hi>Verte longue,</hi> or <hi>Long green pear,</hi> all <hi>Pears</hi> that bear ſpeedily, eaſily, and in great abundance.</p>
                        <p>Thus in a very little <hi>Garden</hi> whoſe Walls contain but about twenty two or twenty four <note place="margin">The total ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the choice Wall-<hi>trees</hi> adviſed for the ſtocking of a <hi>Garden</hi> of 22 or 24 Fathoms in Compaſs.</note> Toiſes or Fathoms in compaſs, we ſhall yet have ſixteen of the choiceſt Fruit-trees; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one white <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> one <hi>Violet-Perdrigon-plum-tree,</hi> one <hi>Common Apricock-tree,</hi> nine <hi>Peach-trees,</hi> and four <hi>Pear-trees.</hi> The <hi>Peach trees</hi> ſhall be three <hi>Admirables,</hi> one <hi>Violet-Haſting,</hi> one <hi>Minion,</hi> two <hi>Chevreuſes,</hi> or <hi>Goat-peaches,</hi> one <hi>Nivette,</hi> and one <hi>Purple-peach;</hi> and the four <hi>Pear-trees</hi> ſhall be two <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> one <hi>Verte longue,</hi> or <hi>Long green pear,</hi> and one <hi>Orange-green pear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After having thus furniſhed eleven or twelve <hi>Toiſes</hi> of <hi>good Expoſition,</hi> ſix or ſeven <hi>Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or Fathoms of <hi>midling,</hi> and five or ſix <hi>Toiſes,</hi> or ten or twelve yards of <hi>bad,</hi> which make in all four and twenty <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms, in a <hi>Garden</hi> that contains no more in <note place="margin">Continued for a <hi>Garden</hi> of 60 <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms Compaſs.</note> its four Walls; I think for the better proſecuting the execution of my deſign, it will be very pertinent for me to continue my directions for the proportion of thirty <hi>Toiſes</hi> or
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48210:105"/>
Fathoms of <hi>Good Expoſition,</hi> which make about fifteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms for the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> and <note place="margin">From which it will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtill augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 600 <hi>Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or Fathoms of good Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and 1200 in all.</note> as many for the <hi>Southern Expoſition,</hi> and afterwards to employ the remaining thirty <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms in the two other <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> allotting the one half to the <hi>Midling</hi> one, and the other half to the <hi>bad one;</hi> after which, I will fill up more and more of them, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſtill thirty <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms each time, till I come to ſix hundred <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of <hi>Good Expoſition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Methinks that in this Scheme or Project, all the World may without trouble or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion find what they ſhall need for the ſtocking of their <hi>Wall-Plantations,</hi> and in ſine, that the Directions which I ſhall give there, may afford ſufficient light to thoſe who have a greater extent of Walling to ſtock, how to fill it up.</p>
                        <p>For I dare affirm, that unleſs it be for the <hi>Garden</hi> of ſome Great King, that any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subject will find he has a terrible quantity of Wall trees, if he has 1200 <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <note place="margin">1200 Toiſes or Fathoms of Wall-Trees, enough for any ſubject of the greateſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> Fathoms of them in all, <hi>viz.</hi> 600 of very good ones, 300 midling ones, and 300 bad ones. That is to them that know the Conſequence, a number great enough to fright any Man, becauſe of the difficulty he will find in ordering and managing them to the beſt advantage.</p>
                        <p>Add to this, that if we ſuppute the quantity of <hi>Peaches</hi> which every <hi>Peach-tree</hi> may reaſonably yield at the end of five or ſix years, we may expect from every hundred Stocks <note place="margin">What quantity of Fruit every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot of <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> may yield, at 5 or 6 Years old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> of them, at leaſt five or ſix thouſand <hi>Peaches,</hi> though every Stock ſhould yield but fifty or threeſcore each, and what will that be in compariſon of the crop they will yield, when they ſhall bear twice as many, as they may eaſily do at the age of eight or nine Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To proceed then, having already furniſhed twelve <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> of <hi>Good Expoſition,</hi> and being minded to continue on to thirty, we muſt reckon that the ſpace from the <hi>twelfth to the thirteenth Toiſe or Fathom, will afford us over and above the former Number, one ſecond Minion Peach-tree.</hi> And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That from the thirteenth to the fourteenth, a ſecond Violet Haſting Peach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſhall place nothing <hi>in the ſpace between the fourteenth and fifteenth, the better to make room for the diſtances of others.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That from the fifteenth to the ſixteenth, ſhall be for a ſecond Chevreuſe.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>From the eighteenth to the nineteenth, for a firſt Common Apricock Tree.</hi> And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the nineteenth to the twentieth, ſhall be left void, to give the greater ſcope for the other diſtances, as I have already ſaid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We cannot ſpeak well enough of the white <hi>Maudlin Peach,</hi> when it is planted in a good Soil, and is well expoſed, only the <hi>Ants</hi> make War a little too much againſt it; and <note place="margin">A remark about <hi>Ants.</hi>
                           </note> what is worſe, we know not how to ſecure it from them, which reproachful misfortune does it a great deal of prejudice among the Curious.</p>
                        <p>To ſee ſome <hi>Trees</hi> of it bear abundance, and others but little Fruit, ſeems to give us good <hi>Grounds</hi> to ſay with ſome <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> that there are two ſorts of them, one which they call the <hi>great</hi> one, and the other the <hi>little</hi> one; but yet for all that, neither by their Flower, which in both is large, and has but a little bluſh of Red, nor by the Leaf of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which in both is large, and very much dented, nor by their ripening, which happens to both at the ſame time, being towards the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> nor by their colour, bigneſs, ſhape, juice, taſte, nor Stone, which are alike in both of them; no, not by all theſe marks, I ſay, which ought to conſtitute an eſſential difference, can I find ſufficient reaſon to perſwade me to embrace the Opinion of thoſe that think there are two diſtinct ſorts of them, both of them being large, round, and half flat, very much painted with red on the Sunny ſide, and not at all on the other, and have a fine Pulp, a ſweet and ſugred juice, a rich taſte, no red about their Stone, which Stone in them both, is ſhort, and almoſt round, all which conſidered, ſuſpends my Judgment as to the Point of their being two different kinds.</p>
                        <p>Beſides which, I have obſerved, that they both produce very goodly <hi>Trees,</hi> and that when I have brought up ſtocks both of that pretended ſort that yielded but little Fruit, and of that that bore a great deal, and taken ſome grafts from that which bore a great deal, and grafted them upon thoſe that bore but little, yet the <hi>Trees</hi> they produced, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me very little Fruit.</p>
                        <p>So that in Concluſion, I believe this difference in their bearing, proceeds only from the greater or leſſer vigour of the ſtock of the <hi>Tree;</hi> that which has a great deal, produces greater main Branches, and fewer ſmall ſhoots, whereas the other on the contrary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces leſſer main Branches, and more ſmall ſhoots; now the main Branches, as we have already, ſo many times inculcated, yield no Fruit, but 'tis the ſmall ſhoots only that are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48210:105"/>
the bearing Branches, and if we give but a larger extent of Wall to theſe ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous <hi>Trees,</hi> and leave them thick Branches enough, and leave them a little longer than ordinary, we ſhall ſee that when they have more room to ſpend their fury in, they will put forth no more ſuch thick Branches, but will ſhoot out more ſmall ones, and conſequently will give us more Satisfaction and Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Perſick Peach</hi> is a Fruit of a marvellous increaſe, and of; no leſs admirable taſte; it <note place="margin">The <hi>Perſick Peach</hi> deſcribed with its Character.</note> is longiſh, and has all the good qualities we can wiſh it, when the <hi>Tree</hi> is in health, and grows in a good <hi>Ground,</hi> and well expoſed, and as the Stones come pretty near the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of their Fruit; that of the <hi>Perſick Peach</hi> is a little longiſh, the Pulp which is next to it, is but very little tinged with Red. It ripens juſt when the <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> or <hi>Goat-peach</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and a little before the <hi>Admirable</hi> comes in, that is to ſay, it very commodiouſly chooſes the time which is moſt advantageous to us. To go on,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the Twentieth to the One and Twentieth Toiſe, or Fathom, ſhall be the place of a Third Admirable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in the ſpace between the One and Two and Twentieth, I have a great mind to <note place="margin">The Violet <hi>Brug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> or <hi>Nectarin,</hi> its Deſcription and Character.</note> place a Violet <hi>Brugnon,</hi> or <hi>Nectarin,</hi> that in this Number we may have at leaſt one ſort of Fruit, that we may carry a good way without ſpoiling. I have a particular value for this ſort of <hi>Brugnon,</hi> or <hi>Nectarin,</hi> when it has time enough to come to ſo full a Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to grow a little ſhriveled and wrinkled with it, for then in truth it is a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Fruit: The Pulp of it is reaſonably tender, or at leaſt is not hard; it is pretty much painted with Red round about the Stone; and its Juice and Taſt are enchantingly delicious. So many good Qualities therefore cannot but juſtifie my Choice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſpace from the Twenty Second Toiſe, or Fathom, to the Twenty Third, ſhould be for a Firſt</hi> Troy-Peach.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the Twenty Third to the Twenty Fourth, ſhould remain void.</hi> And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the Twenty Fourth to the Twenty Fifth, ſhould be for a Firſt St.</hi> Catharine-Peach.</p>
                        <p>Beſides what I have before ſaid of the <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> concerning their ſmallneſs, the time of their Ripening, and their good Taſt, I have nothing elſe to add, but that they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much tinged with Red, and are round, with a little kind of Teat at the end; their Flower is of the greateſt Size, and we are very unhappy that we cannot defend them from the <hi>Ants:</hi> The <hi>Trees,</hi> neither of this ſort, nor of the <hi>Avant,</hi> or <hi>Forward Peaches,</hi> are ſo large as other <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and for that reaſon, may be allow'd ſomething leſs place than the others, which may amount to the retrenching of a Foot, or a Foot and a half for both of them: They laſt not ſo long as the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The St. <hi>Catharine-Plum</hi> Planted againſt a Wall, in a good <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and in a good <note place="margin">The St. <hi>Catharine Plum</hi> deſcribed. The effect of a good Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> Soil, will certainly ſurprize both thoſe that know it but little, and thoſe that thinking they know it, diſeſteem it: For in this ſituation, there can hardly grow a better Fruit in the World, if it may be allowed time to Ripen, ſo that it grows wrinkled about the Stalk: It is, as I have ſaid, a White or Pale Yellowiſh <hi>Plum,</hi> of a longiſh Figure, and pretty large, and that parts very clean from its Stone.</p>
                        <p>I cannot tell whether I may not ſay, that, notwithſtanding the ill report it always had to be abſolutely good for nothing elſe but to make <hi>Prunes,</hi> I am the firſt that have done it the honour to advance it to the choice ſtation of the Wall; but truly I have found it ſo well to anſwer my expectation there, that I cannot ſufficiently extoll it in that reſpect. And as I have been always a great ſearcher out of Experiments, I have likewiſe made trial, whether there might not be ſome other <hi>Plums</hi> which might find ſome aſſiſtance from the Wall towards the improvement of their Excellence, as well as the <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> and St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> as we found, had done; but as I ſhall afterwards more amply tell you, inſtead of meeting with any good ſucceſs with them, I only found that they very much diſhonoured themſelves in that Noble Situation.</p>
                        <p>The Wall has almoſt the ſame effects upon theſe good <hi>Plums,</hi> as boiling Sugar has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome certain Fruits, ſome of which it very notably improves in goodneſs, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Apricocks;</hi> and others, it as ſenſibly ſpoils, ſuch as are commonly <hi>Butter-pears,</hi> when they are Ripe enough to be Eaten Raw.</p>
                        <p>However, I am well enough ſatisfied, that I have found but few <hi>Plums</hi> receive any addition of perfection by the influence of the Wall, ſince at leaſt by making trial, I am now convinced of the vanity of the hopes I once had, that they might, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, am now able to ſave any other Gentleman that may have the ſame Curioſity, the expence of time and pains that I have been at, to content it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In the ſpace from the Twenty Fifth to the Twenty Sixth Toiſe, or Fathom, we will place a firſt Yellow</hi> Admirable-Peach.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>And in that from the Twenty Sixth to the Twenty Seventh, a firſt latter</hi> Violet-Peach.</p>
                        <p>Now before I tell you what are the Excellencies of theſe Two <hi>Peaches,</hi> I muſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you, that they muſt have the choiceſt places in the <hi>Southern Expoſition,</hi> if we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they ſhould attain to their due Maturity; but for our encouragement, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have in them, when the <hi>Nivette Peaches</hi> are gone, Two ſorts of Peaches which cannot be enough commended, and eſpecially in forward Years, that is ſuch as are hot and dry.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Yellow Latter Admirable-Peach,</hi> is alſo called the <hi>Apricock-Peach,</hi> and the <hi>Sandalie:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The</hi> Apricock-peach. <hi>The</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalie, <hi>or</hi> Yellow Admirable-peach.</note> It is a <hi>Malacotoon,</hi> as the <hi>Yellow Pavie</hi> is a <hi>Malacotoon:</hi> It entirely reſembles the <hi>Admirable-Peach,</hi> both in ſhape and bigneſs, ſo that it may well be named the <hi>Yellow Admirable,</hi> and the other barely, the <hi>Admirable,</hi> from which it differs in the <hi>Yellow</hi> Colour both of its Skin and Pulp.</p>
                        <p>Both the one and the other are Coloured pretty much with <hi>Red</hi> on the ſunny-ſide, and that <hi>Red</hi> pierces a little more about the Stone of the <hi>Yellow</hi> one, than about that of the <note place="margin">Its Character.</note> 
                           <hi>White</hi> one: It is of a very good Taſt, and well deſerves to be here, tho' it be a little ſubject to grow Doughy as well as other <hi>Yellow Peaches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Latter Violet,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Marble-Peach,</hi> I muſt needs ſay in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The latter Violet,</hi> or <hi>Marble peach.</hi> Its Deſcription and Character.</note> that it has certainly a vinous and delicious Taſt, and when it Ripens well, ſurpaſſes all the reſt: We could only wiſh it ſo much heat as it needs, for aſſuredly it needs a great deal. It grows a little bigger than the ordinary <hi>Violet-Peach,</hi> and is not ſo much Coloured all over with <hi>Red,</hi> as that; from which difference, it had the Name of <hi>Marbled,</hi> becauſe that very often it is indeed but whipped or ſtriped with a <hi>Violet Red:</hi> Its fault is, not to Ripen well, and to chap and burſt out all over, when the end of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Autumn prove too moiſt, or too cold: It produces a Sightly <hi>Tree,</hi> and tho' there be not Two different kinds of it, no more than there is of the other <hi>Haſting,</hi> or <hi>forward Violet Peaches,</hi> yet ſome <hi>Trees</hi> of it have large Flowers, and ſome others but little ones, juſt as the other <hi>Violet Peach-Trees</hi> do.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>We muſt place between the Twenty Seventh and Twenty Eighth Toiſe, or Fathom, a firſt</hi> Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din-Peach.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Between the Twenty Ninth and the Thirtieth, we will put a firſt</hi> White Avant-Peach, <hi>or</hi> Forward-Peach.</p>

                        <p>We may ſay in favour of the <hi>Bourdin-Peach,</hi> almoſt all that has been ſaid in praiſe of all the reſt, ſaving only that commonly it is not quite ſo large as the <hi>Maudlins, Minions, Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſes,</hi>

What remains further to be ſaid of them is, that they are ſome of the roundeſt, beſt coloured, and in fine, of the moſt agreeable <hi>Peaches</hi> to look upon, that we have; to which add, that their inſide does not any way in the World give the lye to their fair external Phyſiognomy, and therefore when all is ſummed up, it muſt needs be a <hi>Peach</hi> that can ſpoil nothing in this <hi>Garden.</hi>

                        <p>I have already ſaid, when I was diſpoſing of the firſt <hi>Weſterly Expoſition,</hi> where we placed four Trees, what I have to ſay about the <hi>Purple-Peach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It remains next, that we ſhould examine wherein the <hi>Forward-Peach,</hi> or <hi>Avant-Peach</hi> excells. Its principal Excellency is then, that it is among the <hi>Peaches</hi> what the <hi>Little</hi>

                           <hi>Haſtings</hi> are among the <hi>Pears,</hi> and the <hi>Ceriſets,</hi> or little <hi>Cherry-plums</hi> are among the <hi>Plums.</hi> It commonly beginning to be ripe a month before any of the other <hi>Peaches,</hi> and for that effect, it aſſumes a Pulp, grows to its bigneſs, and ripens at the very beginning of <hi>July.</hi> It is ſmall and roundiſh, with a little teat at the end; it is ſo very pale, that no Sun can colour it red, how hot ſoever it ſhine upon it, no more than it does the <hi>Narbon-Peach,</hi> as we ſhall afterwards ſhew. It has a Pulp that is fine enough, but very ſubject to grow Doughy; it has a little ſmatch of a <hi>Peach,</hi> which we are raviſhed to taſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48210:106"/>
after we have been ſo long without taſting any thing like it; but moſt eſpecially becauſe it is like the <hi>Aurora</hi> or <hi>Morning Star</hi> before the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Fore-runner</hi> to tell us the good news of the approach of the good <hi>Peaches,</hi> for which reaſon, it was thought to deſerve the name of the <hi>Avant Peach,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Fore,</hi> or <hi>Fore-running Peach.</hi> It is eſteemed, and not only its fault of growing doughy excuſed, but that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of its not having ſo rich and brisk a taſte as moſt of the others; and therefore we reſolve to have one <hi>Avant Peach-tree,</hi> when we have room but for a dozen and a half of <hi>Peach-trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, becauſe we would not give it time enough to diſcover all its faults to us, it's true, we make leſs uſe of it raw, than in making <hi>Compoſes</hi> or wet Sweet-meats of the Seaſon, for which it is admirably good; its Flower is of the largeſt Size, and of ſo pale a yellow, that it appears almoſt quite white; naturally it ſhoots out not many Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and conſequently produces no Sightly Tree, and therefore needs not ſo much room as the very <hi>Troy-Peach;</hi> and naturally alſo 'tis of all <hi>Peaches,</hi> one of the moſt ſubject to be annoyed with <hi>Ants,</hi> which inconvenience made me not very haſty to introduce it ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er among the two and twenty <hi>Trees</hi> we have planted in the thirty firſt <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> of <hi>Good Expoſition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Before we enter into larger <hi>Gardens,</hi> to look out there for a greater proportion of the <hi>Good Expoſitions,</hi> let us firſt fill up conformably to what I have above propoſed, that which, as near as we can gueſs, we may have of <hi>Midling</hi> and <hi>Bad Expoſition,</hi> in theſe <hi>Gardens</hi> in which I have already newly diſpoſed of ſo much as there was in them of the <hi>Good</hi> ones. And as both thoſe two together, ought not regularly to take up more Walling than the two <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Quarters together, to which probably they are parallel, I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the proportion of Wall for each of them, may amount to fifteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms apiece, to make thirty for them both, as there are thirty for the two good ones, which would fall out ſo indeed, if the <hi>Garden</hi> were perfectly Square, though it would be really ſo much the leſs agreeable, if it were ſo, becauſe it is moſt deſirable for <note place="margin">What Figure is beſt for a fine Garden to be of.</note> the forming a <hi>Garden</hi> in the moſt beautiful Figure; that firſt, it ſhould be twice as long, as wide. Secondly, that all its ſides that are oppoſite one to the other, ſhould be of an equal length; and laſtly, that the whole ſhould terminate all in right Angles, that is to ſay, with an equal fall of right Lines upon right Lines, as I have already ſhewed, when I was treating of the manner how to diſpoſe every piece of <hi>Ground.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe Gentlemen that ſhall happen to have a little leſs proportion of Wall, in one of their <hi>Expoſitions</hi> than I ſuppoſe, may plant ſo many fewer <hi>Trees</hi> there than I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as that ſhall direct, and may take their meaſures from that place, where in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I have mentioned exactly the Quantity of Wall they have; But if on another ſide, their <hi>Weſtern</hi> Quarter be of a little more extent than I may have gueſſed, they may multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo many more <hi>Trees</hi> of that ſort of <hi>Peaches</hi> they like beſt of thoſe I have planted in the ſame <hi>Expoſition,</hi> as will fill it up; and the <hi>Admirable Peach</hi> is that which of all <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> I would always moſt heartily adviſe them to Multiply.</p>
                        <p>As alſo in Caſe their <hi>Northern-Wall</hi> has more Extent, which may very well be, they may augment the number of thoſe <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> which they find I have expreſſed the moſt eſteem for, which will be either the <hi>Butter-Pears,</hi> the <hi>Bergamots,</hi> the <hi>Virgoulees,</hi> or the <hi>Verte Longues,</hi> or <hi>Long Green Pears,</hi> as they ſhall find moſt agreeable to their palates, and moſt anſwerable to their occaſions; and likewiſe if their <hi>North quarter</hi> has leſs room than I have ſuppoſed, they may plant ſo many the fewer <hi>Trees,</hi> and content themſelves with that number which I have aſſigned for an extent of <hi>Walling</hi> equal to theirs.</p>
                        <p>We have already filled up a <hi>Weſtern-Wall</hi> of about five or ſix <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with four Trees, which are one <hi>Apricock-</hi>Tree, and three <hi>Peach-trees;</hi> namely, an <hi>Admirable,</hi> a <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> and a <hi>Purple peach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to another <hi>Weſterly Wall</hi> of about ſix or ſeven <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms, I would adviſe nothing to be added more than the aboveſaid four Trees, to make the more room for ſetting out the diſtances between them, which ſhould always be about eight Foot, but to that of between ſeven and eight <hi>Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms, there ſhall be added,</p>

                           </note> perceive it, we may ſoon remedy it with a little Sugar.

                        <p>Finding my ſelf ſtocked with a ſufficient number of <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> for the proportion of four hundred and twenty <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> extent of Fruit-Walls, and but with too few <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> for ſo great a proportion of Walling, I thought it convenient to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Stone-Fruits leſs, and the Kernel-Fruits more.

                        </p>
                        <p>I think likewiſe, that the fifteen Additional ones towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> require two <hi>Fig-trees</hi> more, a fifth and a ſixth <hi>Violet Perdrigon plum,</hi> a third <hi>White Perdrigon,</hi> with ſix <hi>Peach-trees,</hi> which ſhall be a ſixth and ſeventh <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> a ſixth <hi>Forward</hi> or <hi>Avant peach,</hi> an eleventh and twelfth <hi>Troy peach,</hi> and an eighth <hi>White Maudlin.</hi>

                        <p>The fifteen added to the <hi>Weſtern Side,</hi> to make up a hundred and twenty, require a fifth and ſixth <hi>Bourdin peach,</hi> a third <hi>Violet Brugnon</hi> or <hi>Nectarin,</hi> one <hi>Italian peach,</hi> one <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> one <hi>Purple peach,</hi> one <hi>Lutter Royal peach,</hi> two <hi>Winter Boncretien pears,</hi> and two <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal Bergamots.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And here I think is the proper place to tell you, that when I have ſeen what number of <hi>Trees</hi> of any one certain kind, as of <hi>Peach-Trees, Pear-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. I am to plant in any certain <hi>Wall-Plantation;</hi> as for example, how many <hi>Violet,</hi> or <hi>Admirable Peach-Trees,</hi> how many <hi>Boncretien,</hi> or <hi>Berganot Pear Trees,</hi> &amp;c. I deſign for my <hi>Eaſt, South, Weſt,</hi> or <hi>North Expoſitions,</hi> I place together, and all one after another, firſt, all the <hi>Trees</hi> of one ſort, as all the <hi>Violet Peaches,</hi> and in theſecnod place, all the <hi>Trees</hi> of another kind, likewiſe one after another, as all the <hi>Admirables</hi> &amp;c, without mixing any of the kinds one with another: As finding that to make better both for the commodity of Gather'ing the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and for preventing any loſs of it.</p>
                        <p>And I never made any other intermixture, as I have already told you, but of <hi>Apricock-Trees</hi> among <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> as I likewiſe uſe to do of <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> among <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> unleſs I have a <note place="margin">When <hi>Apricock</hi> or <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> may be mixed with <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and when not.</note> ſeparate <hi>Garden</hi> big enough to hold all the <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> the extent of my Ground requires, for then I reduce them all into that one place; The ſame thing I do with <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For five hundred and forty <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> length of <hi>Fruit Walling,</hi> allowing about a hundred and thirty five to each <hi>Expoſition,</hi> methinks, to fill up our additional fifteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> of <hi>Wall</hi> towards the <hi>South,</hi> it would not be amiſs for certain curious Perſons to introduce here eight foot of <hi>Early</hi> or <hi>Forward Grapes,</hi> which will take up the room of two <hi>Trees, 2 Azeroll</hi> or <hi>Garden Hawthorn,</hi> or <hi>White Thorn-Trees,</hi> twenty foot of <hi>White Muſcat Grapes,</hi> and ten foot of <hi>Chaſſela's;</hi> or if they pleaſe, rather ten foot of <hi>Cioutat Grapes.</hi> As for the early <hi>Cherry-Trees,</hi> ſeven foot will afford room enough for them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Azeroll,</hi> or <hi>Garden Haw,</hi> is a kind of White <hi>Thorn,</hi> which produces a <hi>Fruit</hi> like both in colour and ſhape, to that of the <hi>Common White Thorn,</hi> but it is twice as big, and its Eye or Crown is great, and very open; its ſtalk is ſhort, ſmall, and ſet hollow into the <note place="margin">The <hi>Azeroll</hi> or <hi>Garden Haw</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> 
                           <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is yellow, and Doughy, having two great ſtones within it, which is the reaſon the <hi>Fruit</hi> has but little Pulp: Its taſte is ſharp and ſowriſh, which pleaſes certain perſons, and therefore when we have five or ſix hundred <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> length of Wall, it is not amiſs to plant a couple of ſtocks of them. It ſhoots forth a great many boughs, and conſequently, its <hi>Tree</hi> is fair enough; Its leaf is a little Larger than that of the <hi>Common White Thorn,</hi> but it is nothing high ſo fruitful as that.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Early</hi> or <hi>Forward Grape,</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Black Morillion,</hi> which takes colour very early, which makes it appear ripe long before it is; Its skin is very tough, and when it is ripe, <note place="margin">The <hi>Early Grape,</hi> or <hi>Black Morillon</hi> Deſcribed. It ripens in the beginning of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                           </note> the <hi>Grape</hi> is very ſweet.

                        <p>As for the <hi>Cioutat Grapes,</hi> I leave the Curious at their own Liberty to preferr it here before the <hi>Chaſſela's,</hi> if they pleaſe. The <hi>Fruit</hi> of both of them is very like in all things, as colour, bigneſs, and taſte; only the leaf of the <hi>Cioutat Vine,</hi> is dented all about the edges like <hi>Parſley,</hi> and beſides, it ſeems to bear more <hi>Fruit</hi> than the <hi>Chaſſela's,</hi> but yet I like the <hi>Chaſſela's</hi> better, and nothing but pure curioſity can induce me to plant ſome feet of it in great <hi>Gardens,</hi> the fifteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> added towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to make up its proportion of a hundred thirty five, ſhall receive two <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> an eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth <hi>Minion Peach,</hi> a ninth and tenth <hi>White Maudlin,</hi> a thirteenth and fourteenth <hi>Haſting</hi> or <hi>Forward Violet Peach,</hi> and a ninth and tenth <hi>Admirable.</hi>

                        <p>And now ſince I have with my beſt skill and Judgment, performed my promiſed undertaking, in directing you how to plant to the beſt advantage, as far as the quantity of 1200 <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> of Wall of 9 foot high, with the choiceſt <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> I think it not amiſs for your better underſtanding of my deſign, to ſet down likewiſe here by themſelves, all the ſeveral <hi>Trees</hi> there are aſſigned to every one of the four <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> that ſo among the great number of Fruits named in the whole, you may ſee at one view how I have diſpoſed of every of them in particular; And this is alſo plainly ſhown from Article to Article containing a gradual Augmentation of 15 <hi>Fathoms</hi> or <hi>Toiſes</hi> to each <hi>Expoſition,</hi> by which method, you may eaſily know for Example, how many of the 40 <hi>Admirable Peach-Trees,</hi> how many of the 30 <hi>Hasting Violets,</hi> how many of the 35 <hi>Bergamot Pear-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. which we have made uſe of, I ſay how many <hi>Trees</hi> of each ſort are placed to a <hi>Southern Expoſition</hi> of 300 <hi>Fathoms,</hi> how many to an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> one of the ſame Extent, how many to a <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and how many to a <hi>Northern Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> and the like of all other <hi>Fruits,</hi> whether Kernal <hi>Fruit,</hi> ſtone <hi>Fruit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I have already declared my Judgment, that there is but a ſmall difference to be made between the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern Expoſition,</hi> except it be for raiſing of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Peaſe, Beans,</hi> or <hi>Artichoaks,</hi> which we would plant in a Sloped Bank, and for <hi>Early Cherries, Early Grapes, Haſting Apricocks,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly for <hi>Muſcat Grapes,</hi> and <hi>Little Muſcat Pears,</hi> which I would likewiſe adviſe you to place in a <hi>Southern Aſpect;</hi> and the reaſon that obliged me to mix theſe two <hi>Expoſitions</hi> together, was becauſe very often <hi>Gardens</hi> are ſo contrived, that one of theſe two <hi>Expoſitions</hi> is quite wanting in them, and therefore either of them that is found there, ought in that <hi>Garden</hi> to be made to ſupply the place of both the two. And indeed how many <hi>Gardens</hi> do we ſee that have but one great Wall towards the <hi>South,</hi> or one great Wall towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> with little or none at all towards the other quarters; But 'tis not the ſame thing as to the <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or <hi>North,</hi> very few perſons ever being guilty of ſuch ill contrivance, to have a <hi>Garden</hi> only furniſh't with Wall, towards thoſe <hi>Aſpects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore they which are accommodated only with a <hi>Southern</hi> Wall, may very well furniſh it with all thoſe <hi>Trees,</hi> I have aſſigned for that and an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> one too, and in like manner thoſe Gentlemen that have only the convenience of an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wall, ſince they cannot have all the advantage they might expect from a <hi>Southern Aſpect,</hi> ought to content themſelves, and make the beſt of their <hi>Eaſtern</hi> ones, by planting in it all the ſame things that are aſſigned for both that, and a <hi>Southern</hi> one; for theſe two <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> as is well
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48210:116"/>
knwon, are capable of receiving every thing that is ſit to be planted in the other two; whereas the other two <hi>Expoſitions</hi> are not ſit to be made uſe of for the moſt part of thoſe things that require the <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> and conſequently, we ought not eaſily to hazard to plant towards the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> any <hi>Muſcat Grapes, Haſting Cherries, Haſting Peaſe, Plums</hi> to eat Raw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſay <hi>Plums</hi> to eat Raw; for good <hi>Plums</hi> as well as <hi>Good Grapes,</hi> ſhould bring their Natural <hi>Sugar</hi> with them; which is a perfection that nothing but a thorow ripeneſs can give them, and ſuch an accompliſh'd Ripeneſs is not to be attained in a <hi>Northern Aſpect,</hi> and whereas other Fruits as <hi>Peaches, Pears,</hi> &amp;c. are capable of being better'd with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Sugar, <hi>Prunes</hi> will admit of no ſeaſoning.</p>
                        <p>I have one obſervation more to offer to thoſe who have much Walling towards the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and none towards the <hi>North,</hi> which is that they may very well forbear plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards their <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Eaſt,</hi> many things which I have aſſigned for a <hi>Northern</hi> Wall; as for Example, ſome Baking <hi>Pears, Bourdelai's,</hi> or <hi>Verjuice Grapes, Gooſe-berries, Currans, Raſp-berries,</hi> &amp;c. the places of the <hi>Southern Expoſition,</hi> ſeeming to me too precious to be beſtowed upon Fruits of ſo little value, and that thrive well enough without the aſſiſtance of any Walls, unleſs they know not how to chooſe any thing better wherewithal to ſill up their <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Walls.</p>
                        <p>But ſuch Gentlemen as are accommodated with both an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern Expoſition,</hi> may divide into two parts thoſe things which I have placed under the ſingle head of a Good <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and may proportion them equally or unequally according to the extent of their ſeveral Walls, only taking care to reſerve for the <hi>Southern Aſpect,</hi> thoſe things which are chiefly valuable for their precocity, and early advance in Maturity.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Plums</hi> are a ſort of Fruit that is pleaſing enough to every Body, and <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper well enough in all ſorts of Ground, let it be dry and ſandy, or moiſt and hearty. <note place="margin">How to order a <hi>Plum</hi> or <hi>Cherry Garden.</hi>

                        <p>We have ſome certain kinds of them, whoſe Bloſſoms are much more tender and ſuſceptible of the injuries of an unkind ſeaſon, than others, as for Example, the <hi>Perdri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Violet</hi> one; and therefore I would have none of them planted in the open air, eſpecially in Countries that are inclining to cold, or on thoſe ſides that are a little more ſubject than the reſt, to the inſults of the <hi>Froſts;</hi> My ſelf for that reaſon, as well as for the improving them to a greater perfection of goodneſs, taking care to plant them by Walls, as I have already told you.</p>

                        <p>Thus Inſenſibly we might form a <hi>Plum Garden,</hi> of fourſcore or a hundred Stocks of Trees; and that is a great deal, conſidering how little a while that Fruit laſts when it comes, and how troubleſome it is when it takes up a great deal of Room to no purpoſe, as it often happens; for when they take, that number is enough to furniſh us a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent abundance of <hi>Plums,</hi> to convert into both <hi>Prunes</hi> and <hi>Sweet-meats.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The number of the other ſorts of <hi>Plums</hi> is very great, and they that have a mind to it, may ſtuff their Gardens with them, if they pleaſe, but at leaſt they ſhall have no reaſon to blame me for counſelling them to it.</p>
                        <p>About mid-<hi>June</hi> the <hi>Red Fruits</hi> begin to come in, and hold at leaſt till the end of <hi>July.</hi> Among which I reckon <hi>Cherries, Griots,</hi> and <hi>Bigarro's</hi> or <hi>Heart Cherries,</hi> to be the moſt principal; we may have <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> of them, but <hi>Standards</hi> are better. They are <hi>Fruits</hi> ſo well known every where, that they need no Deſcription, I prize none of them ſo particularly as the Large <hi>Latter Cherries,</hi> which they call <hi>Monmorancies,</hi> and next them the <hi>Bigarro's,</hi> or <hi>Heart Cherries,</hi> and in the third place the <hi>Griots</hi> or <hi>Agriots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Guignes</hi> or <hi>Guings,</hi> of which there are <hi>White, Red</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> are indeed Early <note place="margin">

                        <p>The <hi>Bigarro</hi> or <hi>Heart Cherry</hi> is a Fruit both firm and crackling, Longiſh and almoſt Square, but always very ſweet and very agreeable. Its Tree ſhoots out thick Branches, and that are Luxuriant enough, and its Leaf is Longiſh.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Griot</hi> or <hi>Agriot</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Blackiſh Cherry,</hi> of a pretty firm conſiſtence, and very ſweet and excellent. It Bloſſoms mightily, but withall is very ſubject to miſcarry in the Bloſſom. Its Tree produces a thick <hi>Dwarf-tree,</hi> with a top compoſed of Branches, keeping cloſe and tight together, and its Leaf is broad and blackiſh, none of the kinds of <hi>Meriſes</hi> or common Black-cherries, deſerve to be admitted into an <hi>Artificial Garden,</hi>

                        <p>OUR Garden being formed, dunged, accommodated, divided, and in ſine, quite ready for planting, and every Gentleman knowing what number of Trees he needs according to the bigneſs of his Garden, and having alſo reſolved upon the choice of the kinds, and what proportion of each kind he is to plant, with reſpect to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his <hi>Ground,</hi> and to the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year.

                           <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> that have been Grafted above a year, or above two, without being ſtript <note place="margin">Marks of Bad <hi>Peach Plants.</hi> Of what thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Age they ſhould, or ſhould not be.</note> below, are worth nothing, they being hardly vigorous enough to ſprout above the old Branches; the ſame judgment is to be made of thoſe which are above three Inches, or not ſo much as between one and two Inches thick below, and of thoſe that are Grafted upon old <hi>Almond Stocks,</hi> and are about four or five Inches thick.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Thoſe ſorts of Trees that attain to a due bigneſs the firſt, or at leaſt the ſecond year, prove ordinarily admirable ones, becauſe that ſhows they are Grafted upon a very good Stock.</p>

                           <hi>Standard-Trees</hi> muſt be ſtraight, and be at leaſt full ſix good foot high, and five or ſix Inches thick below, and four or five above, having always their Bark as little rugged as may be, and rather on the contrary, ſmooth and ſhining as a mark or their Youth, and of the goodneſs of the Soil from which they are taken.</p>
                        <p>As to the manner how Trees ſhould be faſhioned, I Judge that for all ſorts of <hi>Dwarf</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> it is better they ſhould be ſtraight, and conſiſting only of one entire <hi>Stick,</hi> and of one only Graft, than to be compoſed of two or three Grafts, or ſeveral branches, the new ſprouts that will ſhoot out round about the ſingle body of the Tree when top't, and new Planted, being more fit and pliable to be turned as we would have them, to make a fair Tree, than if they conſiſted of two Sticks, or of old branches, becauſe we cannot be aſſured from what part of thoſe old branches of the new planted Tree, the new Sprouts will ſhoot, and becauſe commonly they grow ill favouredly, and ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly interlaced one with another, that we are forced to cut them quite away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to make ſo many wounds in the Tree, which is time loſt both for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the beauty of it, and of its producing Fruit, both which are by this means retarded. I would have my Tree then without any branches at all below, but yet I would have it have good Eyes or buds, which may by conſequence, promiſe good Branches, and eſpecially in <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> ſo that we muſt never take thoſe whoſe Eyes are as 'twere put out, that is to ſay, their iſſues ſtopt up, becauſe 'tis very rarely that any new branches ſpring out from ſuch; and 'tis ſo true that I deſire but one ſingle ſtick, that commonly when I find two grafts, I take away the weakeſt, and preſerve only that which is the more vigorous and better placed of the two.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Standard-Trees</hi> that are to be planted in the full and open air, I am content they ſhould have ſome branches about their tops, that may be ſhortned when they are new planted, becauſe we require not ſo regular an exactneſs for the Beauty of theſe tall Trees, as we do for that of leſſer ones; it being ſufficient if thoſe of the former ſort be adorned with tops, that Spread into but any thing nigh a round figure, to be reaſonably enough, handſome in their kind.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IF the Trees be already pull'd up, we muſt not only have regard to all the particulars above expreſſed, without neglecting one of them, but we muſt beſides have a care <note place="margin">Now to chooſe Trees when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken up. Marks of Trees ſpoiled.</note> they have not been too long taken up; ſo that their bark is grown ſhriveled, and their wood dry, and perhaps quite dead; or that their bark be not too much peeled off, or the grafting place ſtrangled with too hard binding with Pack-thred, or that they be not grafted too low, and eſpecially in Peach-Trees, ſo that to place the roots as they ſhould be, we muſt neceſſarily be forced to bury the Grafts under Ground in planting them; or elſe grafted too high, ſo that they cannot begin a well proportioned <hi>Wall,</hi> or <hi>Dwarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tree,</hi> both which ought to begin about ſix or ſeven inches from the Ground.</p>
                        <p>But this is not all, for we muſt take ſpecial heed too to the roots, becauſe though they had all the other neceſſary good qualifications in perfection, yet if their roots be much defective, we muſt e'en reckon ſuch Trees good for nothing.</p>
                        <p>To be able to pronunce a Tree then to be well qualified as to its roots, in the firſt place they muſt be of a proportionable thickneſs to the bigneſs of the Tree, that is, it <note place="margin">Good qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required in the roots of young Trees.</note> muſt have at leaſt one root very near as big as the body of the Tree; for when they are all ſmall and <hi>Fibrous,</hi> and like a head of Hair, it is almoſt an infallible ſign of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tree, and of its approaching death, or at leaſt of its never being likely to produce any good effect; neither is the over great quantity of ſuch <hi>Fibres</hi> any very good <note place="margin">Marks of a Dying Tree.</note> ſign.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place we muſt ſee that the principal roots be neither rotten nor ſplit, nor very much peeled or unbarked, nor grown very red, or dry or hard; for if they be rotten, they ſhow a great infirmity in the principle of life of the whole Tree, the roots never rotting when the Tree is in good health; If they be ſplit in the place out of which they Spring, it is a wound that may be termed incurable, and the <hi>Gangreen</hi> and <hi>Rottenneſs</hi> will ſieze upon it, and ſo it will be left like a Work-man without either hands or tools.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, they who pull up Trees ſhould be very careful to do it dextrouſly and gently, and for that effect to make good holes, that they may not be obliged to ſtrain <note place="margin">What caution is to be uſed in taking up Trees.</note> any part of them too violently when they draw them up, or elſe they will not fail to ſplit or break ſome good Root or other.</p>
                        <p>If likewiſe they be too much grated or unbark't in thoſe parts, which ſhould be moſt particularly preſerved, thoſe are alſo dangerous wounds, and eſpecially in <hi>Stone Fruit-Trees,</hi>

                        <p>And in fine, if the roots be dried up either by froſt, or by having been too long drawn out of the Ground, and expoſed to the air, we are to Reject that Tree, it being certain it will never take to grow again.</p>
                        <p>And over and above all theſe cautions, it is to be wiſhed that the Tree to be choſen have its roots ſo well diſpoſed, that we may find one rank or ſtory of good ones, that <note place="margin">Roots to be well placed, and what it is to be ſo.</note> may be in ſome meaſure perfect, and eſpecially of young ones, ſo that when all the bad ones are taken off, whether above or below it, there may remain two, or three, or four, which may in ſome manner encompaſs the body, or at leaſt be ſo well ſituated,

                           <p>How to prepare a Tree for Planting.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THis preparation is of ſo great a conſequence for the making of Trees take new foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and grow again, that very often they take, and produce a good effect only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were well prepared before they were replanted, and no leſs often fail taking, or producing a good head or top, becauſe they were ill prepared.</p>
                        <p>There are two things to be prepared in them, <hi>viz.</hi> a leſs principal one which is the head or top, and another which is moſt highly principal, and important, and that is the foot or roots.</p>
                        <p>As to the head, there is but little myſtery in ordering that, either in <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> it being needful only for that effect, to remember theſe two points.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, that as it appears, we do a great prejudice to a Tree when we pluck it up, becauſe we always weaken it thereby, and abate its vigour, and its activity at leaſt for ſome time, we muſt therefore take off ſo much of its charge and burthen about its head, as may be proportionable to what we take from it of that ſtrength and activity, as we certainly do by removing to a new place, and retrenching it of ſome of its Roots: That is a maxim that needs no proof.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond point, we are to be mindful of, is, that we muſt leave its body no higher than is convenient for the uſe the Tree is deſigned for: Some being to produce their effect very low, as the <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> which therefore muſt be cut pretty ſhort, and others to produce theirs very high, as the <hi>Standard-Trees</hi> which therefore muſt be left of a conſiderable height: But I ſeldom cut either ſort of them to the length they are to be of, till I have firſt finiſh'd the whole operation, that is to be performed about their roots. And this is the Method I obſerve in doing it. <note place="margin">The Author's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in Triming the Roots of Trees.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, I order all the <hi>Fibres</hi> to be cut off as near as can be to the place out of which it ſprings, unleſs it be a Tree that I plant again aſſoon as ever 'tis pluck'd up, without leaving it a moment out of the Ground, otherwiſe if it continue never ſo little while in the air, all that would be good to preſerve of its root, which is a kind of tuft of White ſmall hair like roots or <hi>Fibres,</hi> turns, preſently black, and conſequently ſpoils, being, as it ſeems no more able to endure the air, than ſome ſorts of fiſh that die as ſoon as ever they are out of the Water. But we can never have opportunity to ſave this White <hi>Fibrous</hi> part of the roots, but when we pull up a Tree in one part of our Garden, to plant it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in another place of the ſame Garden, for then indeed we may ſave ſome part of thoſe <hi>Fibres</hi> which is not broken, and whoſe extremities or points appear ſtill acting as 'twere, and that comes out of a good place, otherwiſe if all thoſe conditions be not found in it, we are not to make any account of it; and for the better preſervation of it, we may too at the ſame time, take along with it ſome of its former mold, that hangs next about it, like a kind of Turf, taking care in planting it to place and ſpread out well that hairy or <hi>Fibrous</hi> part. <note place="margin">How to order the Roots of a Tree that has been longer pulled up.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>To return now to order a Tree that has been longer pulled up, I firſt of all then take away all that <hi>Fibrous</hi> or <hi>hairy</hi> part which many Gard'ners ſave with ſo much care, and ſo little reaſon, in ſuch Trees as thoſe: And when I am about ſtocking any large <hi>Plantation,</hi> Iorder my people immediately to fall to work to retrenching from the Trees, what is to be cut from them, before I plant them, and that both in the day time in ſome bye place of the Garden, and particularly in the night, in ſome place within-doors by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light, to hinder the delaying of ſome other work no leſs in haſt, that cannot be done but without-doors; and ſo by that means, I take advantage of the night, which comes upon us ſo ſoon, and ſo unconveniently at the uſual ſeaſon of making our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48210:122"/>
The <hi>Fibres</hi> being thus taken away, and by that means, the greater roots laid open to my full view, I am the better able to ſee the bad ones to take them quite off, and to diſcern the good ones to ſave them, and afterwards to regulate the cutting them to the exact length I would leave them of; and very often, when I find the roots of any Trees a little too much dried, I order them to be ſteeped ſeven or eight hours in water before I replant them.</p>
                        <p>When I ſpeak of good and bad roots, it may be thought I mean by theſe latter, only ſuch roots as are broken, or unbarked, or rotten, or dry; But yet I mean ſomething of <note place="margin">What the Author means by Good and bad Roots.</note> greater conſequence; and that is, that every Tree that is planted, and eſpecially every Nurſery-Tree, ſhoots out ſometimes, either all good roots, or all bad ones, or both good ones and bad ones at the ſame time, which comes to paſs as follows.</p>
                        <p>A Tree planted with the preparations recommended by me, if it takes, muſt ſhoot forth new roots, or elſe it dies, all its old roots being of no ſervice to it; And of thoſe <note place="margin">Notes how to diſtinguiſh them, and inſtructions how to deal with them.</note> new ones, ſome are fair and thick, and ſome are feeble and ſmall; the fair ones will ſpring either out of the Extremities of thoſe which we left it, which is moſt to be deſired, or elſe from ſome other part, that is, either from the body of the Tree, and conſequently above the old roots, which compoſed the extream parts of the Tree, or from that part of the old ones that is neareſt the Body of the Tree, whilſt the old ones either have ſhot out nothing at all throughout their whole extent, or but very ſmall roots out of their Extremities, and ſome thicker ones a little further off thoſe Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>In which two Caſes, the thick ones growing either out of the Body of the Tree, or out of any part of the old roots but their ends, make all the reſt both old and new inſenſibly to periſh, and dwindle away, and therefore the periſhing ones are to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bad, becauſe if not taken away, they make the Tree grow Yellow and Languiſh in ſome part of its top, or head.</p>
                        <p>It is no hard matter to know the good ones from the bad ones, becauſe that ſuppoſing according to the order of nature, the lower part of the Body of the Tree planted, ſhould, as in truth it ought, be always bigger than the reſt of it, and maintain it ſelf always in that condition, yet if we perceive that part inſtead of enlarging it ſelf proportionably to the reſt of the body, according to the ſame order of nature, to remain on the contrary ſmaller than ſome part a little higher, from whence in effect we find ſome fair roots to ſpring, then the unthrifty part is to be looked upon as 'twere <hi>accurſed,</hi> and abandoned by <hi>Mother Nature,</hi> which ſeems to take pleaſure in beſtowing its favours upon another, and conſequently we muſt entirely cut away all that leſſer part with all that it had ſhot forth before, (which many Gardiners call <hi>Pivot,</hi> but are miſtaken, as I ſhall afterwards <note place="margin">Pivot, a Hinge or Axel-Tree.</note> ſhew.)</p>
                        <p>The firſt thing to be done then in this caſe, is entirely to take away all that part of it that appears to be ſo abandoned and diſgraced, as cloſe as we can, to the part well nouriſhed and which is as 'twere in favour, that we may only preſerve thoſe roots that ſpring from the fortunate part, what kind of ones, or in how ſmall a number ſoever they be, for indeed the number of them ſhould never be very great; and above all, we muſt take care as I have ſaid, to take away the greateſt part of the old ones, which, far from having any appearance of vigour and of youth, or a lively and freſh colour, look all Black, ſhriveled, and rugged, and worn out, and therefore we are only to eſteem thoſe which are freſh and new, and that we find at the ſame time well pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                        <p>And theſe young ones are to be kept ſhort proportionably to their length, the longeſt <note place="margin">Of what length the good Roots are to be left in <hi>Dwarfs, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,</hi> &amp;c.</note> in <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> of what bigneſs ſoever it be, which is commonly not very great, never being to exceed eight or nine Inches, nor much above a foot in <hi>Standards:</hi> We may leave a greater length the roots of <hi>Mulberry</hi> and <hi>Almond-Trees,</hi> becauſe thoſe of the firſt are very ſoft, and thoſe of the ſecond, very dry and hard, and therefore will be in danger of periſhing, if they be cut too ſhort.</p>
                        <p>After we have fixed the length of the biggeſt roots of our Fruit-Trees, I am to tell you, that the length of two or three, or four Inches will ſerve for the leſſer and feebler ones, and that proportionably to the bigneſs of each, the leaſt being always to be the ſhorteſt; and here as I have elſewhere told you, we muſt uſe a quite contrary method to that we practiſe in the pruning of the <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One ſingle rank or ſtory of roots is enough, and I make more account of two or three roots well placed, than of twenty midling ones. I term roots to be well placed, when being round about the Tree foot, they are like ſo many lines drawn from the center to the Circumference.</p>
                        <p>

All difficult diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures of roots may be Learnt, and ordered by thoſe Figures.</note> Trees, I made coice of fifteen Trees, among the great number that I have taken up and replanted theſe five and twenty or 30 years, which were ſuch in which I obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remarkable difference in the ſituation of their roots, by which I found, that generally all Trees in the ſpreading of their roots imitated ſome one of thoſe fifteen, ſo that having firſt cauſed them to be drawn out in figures, exactly as they were when newly pulled up, and afterwards when they were cut and trimmed, ordering them to be drawn over again in other plates, in the condition they were in then, to ſhow how they muſt be order'd before they be planted, any Gentleman may after that model, regulate the operations that are to be made upon the roots of all ſorts of Trees whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>I likewiſe thought it very convenient to have them drawn too, in the ſtate they were in, while they were ſhooting out the new roots they produce after replanting, that every one might ſee what a Tree well prepared and well planted ſhould do, to thrive and ſucceed well, and wherein it may have been faulty if it proſpers not.</p>
                        <p>And when I have done all that I think fitting to the roots, then I endeavour diſcreetly to judge what depth the loweſt roots require in the Ground, and what quantity of earth the higheſt roots muſt have laid over them; for they muſt be ſecured, and put out of the reach, as well of the Injuries of the Air, as of the delving tools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then I determine of what length or height the Tree muſt be above Ground, that I may have no occaſion to touch it any more after 'tis planted; for we muſt needs ſhake and looſen it when we let alone cutting it till after 'tis planted, and that ſhaking ſeems to me to be very dangerous to the Tree.</p>
                        <p>We need not fear the <hi>Froſt</hi> will do any harm to the place where the Tree is cut off, and ſhortned, there aſſuredly never hap'ning any inconvenience that way, as I can maintain to you by certain experience which you may venture to believe upon my word. The length of the Bodies of the Trees to be left above Ground to all ſorts of Trees, <note place="margin">The Author's Regulation of the height or Length fit to be left to the Bodies of Trees above <hi>Ground.</hi>
                           </note> is to be regulated as follows. If they be little, and to be planted in a dry Soil, they muſt be allowed ſix or ſeven Inches, becauſe that in <hi>Summer,</hi> their head or top may be able to skreen their foot or rooting, from the burning heat of the <hi>Sun;</hi> In moiſt Grounds, they may have ten, or eleven, or twelve at moſt, that their head or top may not too much hinder the heat from imparting its influence to the foot or root which there has need of it: As for the height of the Bodies of <hi>Standards,</hi> that is always to be about ſix or ſeven Inches in all ſorts of Grounds; for taller ones would be too apt to be ſhaken or torn up by the roots by the Winds, and ſhorter would be unpleaſing to the ſight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were a whole entire <hi>Plantation</hi> of <hi>Half Standards,</hi> as is often practiſed for <hi>Plum-Trees, Cherry-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>We muſt have a great care in <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> to leave them two or three good Eyes or Buds in that proportion of length, that is to remain to them, otherwiſe they will be in <note place="margin">A neceſſary caution about <hi>Peach Trees.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>When and how to plant Trees when ready fitted and prepared for it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE firſt thing to be obſerved here, is, that in the ſeaſon of planting, which as all the world knows, laſts from the end of <hi>October,</hi> to the middle of <hi>March,</hi> that is, from the time that the Trees quit their Leaves, till they are almoſt ready to begin to put forth new ones, we muſt chooſe dry, and mild weather, without troubling our heads to take any notice of the Age of the <hi>Moon,</hi> as formerly was practiſed, rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not only incommodious to the Gard'ner in his Work, but alſo hurtful to the Trees that are then planted, becauſe the mold is then too apt to be reduced to a mortar-like conſiſtance, which makes it not ſo proper to ſettle all cleverly down round about, and cloſe to the roots without leaving ſome hollow between, which it is very expedient to prevent. Now, though all thoſe months be equally fit to plant in, ſo that it may ſeem, the ſooner it be done, the better, yet as I willingly affect to plant preſently after <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemas,</hi> in dry and light Grounds, ſo I care not to plant neither till the end of <hi>February,</hi> in cold and moiſt ones; becauſe the Trees in theſe laſt can do nothing all <hi>Winter,</hi> and may more likely be ſpoiled there, than be able to preſerve themſelves, whereas in ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grounds, they may begin even that very ſame <hi>Autumn,</hi> to ſhoot out ſome ſmall roots, which is a great advance to them to put them in the way of doing wonders in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Spring.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond obſervation is, that we are to regulate exactly all the diſtances which are to be between one Tree and another, whether they be <hi>Wall-Trees, Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Standards,</hi> that we may know perfectly both the number of Trees to be planted in general, and how many there are to be of every particular kind.</p>
                        <p>The third is, to regulate exactly the places to be aſſigned both to each ſort of Tree, and to each particular Tree, I liking beſt that all the Fruits of the ſame ſeaſon, ſhould be placed in the ſame <hi>Canton,</hi> or <hi>Parcel</hi> of Ground.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is, to make even by a line, holes about the wideneſs and form of a hat; for I ſuppoſe trenches to be well made, and if ſo, the Hole, though little, will be big <note place="margin">The fourth to make convenient <hi>Holes,</hi> or <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> to plant them in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> enough to plant the Tree in, and it would be but time, expence, and Labour loſt, to make it bigger.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is to order every Tree to be carried and laid near its hole, before we begin to plant any of them; and if there be occaſion to plant any <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> about any Squares, or to form a <hi>Quincunce,</hi> I would have the faireſt, and beſt qualified placed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at the corners of the ſeveral Squares, or Ranks, and likewiſe in Wall-plantations. It's moſt convenient always to plant the ſineſt Trees, and thoſe that bear the fineſt Fruits, in the moſt eminent places, and the moſt viſited, as, near the <hi>Gates,</hi> and along thoſe <hi>Fruit Walls</hi> near the faireſt <hi>Walks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet though I here make choice of the faireſt, it do's not follow that we are never to plant any but ſuch as are fair, and accompanied with all the hopeful appearances of thriving; Though it be true enough that after we have taken all the care we can to chooſe none but ſine ones, yet ſome of them will be always ſiner than the others.</p>
                        <p>The Trees then being all carried and laid every one near its aſſigned place, if we be to plant <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> I begin with the corners of each Square, that they may ſerve to <note place="margin">The Author's Method of <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</note> guide us to place the others direct in the ſame Lines; and if the Soil has been new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dug up and moved, and mixed with a good quantity of long dung, ſo that it ſeems not to be ſo firm and cloſe as it ſhould be, I take care to ſink my Trees but about half <note place="margin">Of What <hi>Depth</hi> Trees are to be planted.</note> a foot, meaning that the extreamity of the loweſt root of the Tree is but half a foot deep in the Earth, becauſe as I reckon, the Ground will ſink at leaſt half a foot; and becauſe it is better to plant too high, than two low, at the end of ſome months, my Trees will be found ſunk about a foot into the Earth, which is the juſteſt meaſure we can aſſign them in that reſpect, Trees planted deeper, almoſt always dying in a few years.</p>
                        <p>When I have planted the corner Trees, then I place a man at that rank I have a mind to plant, to adjuſt the Trees with a line, that they may be ſure to be planted in a right line, and I take another man with a ſpade to cover up the roots of the Trees as faſt as I preſent them in their places, and be informed by my line manager that they are right in the line, and ſo in one morning I will plant four or five hundred <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> with eaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48210:123"/>
It is yet more eaſie to plant in a little time a great many <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> becauſe there is no need of uſing a line; but in forming a <hi>Quincunce,</hi> we cannot go ſo faſt, becauſe that, as every Tree muſt anſwer exactly to two ranks, there muſt be two <hi>Aliners,</hi> viz. one for each rank, and there is always ſome time loſt before the Tree can be placed ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as equally to anſwer two ſeveral ranks.</p>
                        <p>And we muſt not only be careful to plant our Trees a little high, and very ſtraight, but we muſt be particularly mindful to turn their principal roots towards the good Soil; this being the moſt important point of all; ſo that though it be much to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all Trees deſigned for <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> ſhould appear ſtraight upright upon their feet, after they are planted; yet if the diſpoſition of their Roots which perhaps naturally incline to Pirot, or ſpread round, require that the Tree ſhould be a little ſtooped, to give that good ſituation to its Roots which I deſire they ſhould have, that is, to give them ſcope to ſpread rather between two Earths, than to ſhoot right downward, I not only make no difficulty to hold the head or the top of the Tree a little ſtooped, and that always over the line that is ſtretched out by it, but I counſel it as a thing neceſſary; otherwiſe, the roots that ſhoot from ſuch a Tree, being naturally inclined to follow the bent of thoſe out of which they ſprout, it will happen, that thoſe roots being forced to ſhoot downwards as low as the bad mold towards the bottom, or beyond the reach of the rain water, the Tree will thereupon grow ſick, and languiſh, and will make an ill-favoured figure, and bring but ſcurvy Fruit, and will at laſt die.</p>
                        <p>From what I have ſaid of the good ſituation of the roots, it follows that if we be to plant any Trees along by the ſides of any Walk or Alley, we muſt take care to avoid turning the principal roots towards the Alley ſide, and with much greater reaſon, ought we to do the ſame when we are planting <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and to take ſpecial care we leave not any good root of them, in vain to ſpend its force and vigour againſt the Walls.</p>
                        <p>This ſtooping of the head in low Trees, need not raiſe in us any ſcurple, or put us in any apprehenſion of ſpoiling the beauty either of their figure in particular, or of that of the whole plantation in general, becauſe it is not the ſame caſe with Branches that are to ſpring forth, as 'tis with roots; for the Branches do not at all follow the Diſpoſition of the ſtooping head; on the contrary, they grow regularly upright round about their trunk, and ſo becauſe their riſe is very near the Ground, their Trees make as a well ſhaped figure, as if they had been planted upright upon their center.</p>
                        <p>It is the ſtandard Trees that are to grow in the full air, that we are neceſſarily oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to plant as upright upon their center as 'tis poſſible; for otherwiſe their Trunks would always remain ſtanding awry, and conſequently would make an unſeemly figure, and beſides would be more ſubject to the inſults of violent winds, and be apt to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by them; and therefore for that ſame conſideration, they muſt be planted a little deeper than other Trees, that is, they muſt be placed a full foot deep in the Ground, and though I caution people not to trample over the Ground where our ſmall Trees are planted, for fear of making them ſink too deep, and becauſe they are in no danger of the Winds, on the contrary, I adviſe them to preſs the Ground as hard and cloſe as as they can, againſt the feet of theſe Standards, to faſten them, and make them the firmer to reſiſt the violence of the winds.</p>
                        <p>After the planting of every Tree, if I have the convenience of any dung-hills, I put a bed of two or three Inches thick of dung over every Tree foot, and cover it over at <note place="margin">The uſe of Dung about Trees.</note> the ſame time with a little Mold, to hide it from being ſeen, as being no handſome ſight.</p>
                        <p>This bed of dung is not ſo much to improve the Ground, which I ſuppoſe already to be good, and well prepared, as particularly to hinder the burning heat of the Months of <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> from penetrating to their roots, and by conſequence from putting them out of due temper, and hindering them from performing their function, which would cauſe no leſs than the death of the Trees.</p>
                        <p>If I want dung, I content my ſelf during thoſe firſt dangerous Months, to cover the feet of my Trees with a bed of Weeds, or Fern; I hinder any thing from growing there <note place="margin">A bed of Weeds or fern may ſerve in want of Dung. In very dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every 15 days in the hot months.</note> that may ſhade or cloud the young ſhoots, and if there be a great drought, as it often happens, I order a pitcher of water to be poured upon each Tree foot, every fifteen days during the three or four hot Months, making firſt a kind of circular trench round the Tree that the water may pierce quite down to it, and when the water is all imbibed, I fill and make up this circle again, even with the reſt of the Ground, ſo that 'tis not diſcerned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="182" facs="tcp:48210:124"/>
But if the ſeaſon prove rainy, thoſe waterings will not be neceſſary. And after all theſe preparations, and precautions, yet we commonly think our ſelves happy enough if we can Stock our plantations ſo well, as to have but few Trees miſcarry under our conduct.</p>

                           <p>How to order Trees planted for Reſerves in Oſier Caſes, or Baskets.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BUT notwithſtanding all this, becauſe ſome Trees may happen to die, and yet as far as 'tis poſſible, it is to be deſired, our plantation ſhould be compleated the very firſt year, I uſe to prepare a greater number of Trees than I have actually need of to fill up my plantation, that I may always have ſome as 'twere in a Body of <hi>Reſerve,</hi> and for that purpoſe, it is my practiſe at the ſame time I am filling up my plantations, to plant ſome Supernumenary Trees of every kind in <hi>Oſier Caſes,</hi> or <hi>Baskets,</hi> but more of <hi>Stone,</hi> than of <hi>Kernel Fruits,</hi> becauſe thoſe former moſt commonly are in greater hazard of dying than the others.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly I chuſe out ſome good place in the <hi>Garden,</hi> (the moſt ſhady parts of it being the moſt proper for this effect) and there I plant ſome Trees in <hi>Oſier Baskets,</hi> well ticketed, or at leaſt carefully ſet down in my Book according to the order both of their Ranks, and of the reſpective places allotted to them in thoſe Ranks, that I may have recourſe to them, when any Tree ſhall happen to die or languiſh in its place; Being deſirous, if it be poſſible, that my plantation ſhould continue finiſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as well in its figure, as in the kinds of Trees, according to my firſt modelling of it.</p>
                        <p>In order to which, I keep in a leaning poſture in the Reſervatory Baskets thoſe Trees <note place="margin">How to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>This operation of the Tranſporting of Reſerve Trees, may be done till Mid-ſummer; and when we have a mind to go about it, we muſt firſt by way of preparation, water thoſe Reſerve Trees well that we deſign to remove, (which probably will be the faireſt we have) and then move the Earth away neatly round about the Baskets, for fear of breaking the roots of the plants in caſe they have ſhot any beyond the compaſs of their Baskets; and we muſt ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        <p>Now when in removing theſe Reſerve Trees, we perceive any roots of them to have begun to ſhoot out of the Basket, we muſt firſt in placing it, be very careful to preſerve the points of thoſe new Roots, place them well, and ſupport them with good mold, cover them immediately, and ramm the Earth cloſe againſt the Basket, and then water the Ground pretty plentifully round about the Basket, to make the Earth next to it, cleave the cloſer about it, ſo as there may remain no hollow, which may be known by the waters not ſinking ſo haſtily when you pour it on the place as before; And this water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is indiſpenſably neceſſary in what manner ſoever we remove our Reſerve Trees: And laſtly, on thoſe days when the Sun ſhines hot, we muſt cover the head of the Tree with ſtraw Screens, till ſuch time as it begins to ſprout, and then we may begin to take them off a nights; But this laſt precaution is not neceſſary but when we ſee any new roots Sprout out of the Basket, or when the Tree has been ſhaken and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened.</p>

                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48210:124"/>
The ſame care and caution we uſe in placing againſt Walls Trees thus brought up in Reſerve Baskets: We muſt practiſe too in placing the ſame ſort of Trees for <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Standards,</hi> and above all, we muſt have a ſpecial care to leave thoſe new roots as little as poſſible in the Air; otherwiſe they will preſently grow Black, and conſequently die.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing elſe to add about this head, but only directions how to make theſe <note place="margin">How the Baskets muſt be made and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Baskets, which muſt be made purpoſely, and ſo looſe wrought that you may ſee through them, as well becauſe the roots of the plants may the more eaſily grow through them, as that taking up leſs ſtuff, they may coſt ſo much the leſs, and beſides when there is ſo much ſtuff as to make them too thick and impenetrable, it do's but harm. They muſt be made of the greeneſt and freſheſt gathered <hi>Oſter</hi> that is to be had, that being put quite green into the Earth, they may laſt the longer without Rotting, that is, at leaſt a whole Year; for thoſe that have been made any time, rot ſooner. They muſt not be very deep, becauſe then they would be too troubleſome to remove, eight or nine Inches depth is enough, that when they are ſet into the Ground as deep as till their brims be covered, we may have room enough to put into them firſt about four or five Inches depth of Mold, and then the Tree, and after that, cover their roots with a little quantity of Earth more; and we may in removing theſe Reſerve Trees with their Baskets, take off ſome of the uppermoſt Mold, if we find them too cumberſome to carry; But as I told you before, we muſt be very careful to ramm down the Earth cloſe about the Baskets, that there remain no chink or hollow.</p>
                        <p>As to the bigneſs of the Baskets, it muſt be proportionable to the length of the roots of the Trees we deſign to plant in them: They muſt be at leaſt big enough to afford us room to put in three or four Inches depth of Mold between the ends of the roots, and the Brim of the Basket, ſo that for Trees deſigned for Wall <hi>Trees,</hi> the Baskets need not be ſo large as otherwiſe, becauſe thoſe Trees are planted in them in a leaning poſture, and therefore lie ſo near one ſide, that all their roots are turned to the other, and ſo their new roots may find room enough provided the Basket be wide enough; But for Trees deſigned for <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> becauſe they muſt be planted in the middle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhoot out roots round about them, the Baskets for them muſt be a little Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>The Baskets likewiſe for <hi>Standards,</hi> muſt be proportionably greater than for low Trees. I need not tell you, that the Baskets muſt be round, becauſe every Body knows that, though they might be made Oval or Square too, but then they would coſt more and be never a whit the better.</p>
                        <p>The Difference therefore of the Bigneſs of Trees obliges us to make Baskets of three different Sizes, <hi>viz.</hi> Little ones of about a foot Diameter, Midling ones, of about fifteen or ſixteen Inches, and Great ones, of about eighteen or twenty. The principal Quality moſt to be look'd after in them, is, that their bottom be ſtrong and ſolid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear without burſting, the weight of Earth to be charged upon them, and that the Edges both above and below be ſo well wrought as not to unravel; There muſt be alſo a Welt round about the middle for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                        <p>And I am not content to make uſe of this precaution of Reſerve-Trees at the time of my firſt planting any great plantations, but I practiſe it every year, for a certain finall number of Trees, according to the bigneſs of the plantation I have to cultivate, that when there happens any accident to any of the Trees placed in it, as there may happen many, I may remedy it aſſoon as I am threat'ned with it, or aſſoon as ever the accident happens; for in fine we ſhould always be in a condition to keep our plantation full and compleat without ſuffering any Tree in it that will not comply with our deſign.</p>
                        <p>A little coſt will put our minds at eaſe in this reſpect; and for want of that, we may loſe much time and pleaſure too.</p>
                        <p>It is now time for us to proceed to the Maſter Work of Gard'ners, which is Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                        <p>GEnerally ſpeaking, <hi>Pruning of Trees</hi> is Cutting off ſome of their <hi>Branches;</hi> and ſo we commonly ſay, that a <hi>Tree</hi> is <hi>prun'd,</hi> when many marks appear of <hi>Branches</hi> being cut off. We likewiſe ſay, that a <hi>Gard'ner prunes,</hi> when he is cutting ſome <hi>Branches</hi> from his <hi>Trees</hi> with his <hi>Pruning-Knife.</hi> This <hi>Pruning</hi> has been look'd upon in all Times, among the Curious in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> as the Maſter-piece of <hi>Gard'ning:</hi> And, indeed, the Practice of it began not in our Days, for it was held as a Maxim many Ages ſince, as it appears by the Teſtimony of the Ancients; ſo that, to ſpeak the Truth, we only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">Columella, Theophraſtus, Xenophon.</note> now, or perhaps improve what was practis'd by our Fore-fathers.</p>
                        <p>This Cuſtom of <hi>Pruning</hi> does not commonly extend to all ſorts of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> only to ſuch as are known in <hi>Gardens</hi> by the Names of <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Fruit-Trees, Counter-Eſpaliers</hi> or <hi>Pole-Hedges</hi> and <hi>Dwarfs.</hi> As for thoſe that are called <hi>Tall-ſtandards,</hi> they are ſeldom <hi>prun'd,</hi> unleſs it be once or twice in their firſt Years, either to give them the firſt Turn of a Round Figure, and Overture, which is requiſite at the time they firſt begin to form an Head; or to take away ſome irregular <hi>Branches,</hi> which in proceſs of Time might intangle or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure that Head; which <hi>Pruning</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary. A kind of <hi>Pruning</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe practis'd upon very old <hi>Tall-ſtandards,</hi> by cutting off the dead or languiſhing <hi>Branches,</hi> both large and ſmall; but that is rather called <hi>Cleanſing,</hi> or <hi>Diſ-incumbring,</hi> than <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48210:128"/>
Although the firſt <hi>Idea</hi> People have of <hi>Pruning,</hi> is commonly in relation to the Heads of <hi>Trees,</hi> that is, their <hi>Branches,</hi> which frequently want ſome Correction, to be put in a way of doing well, according to the Mind of their Maſter; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there is ſtill another <hi>Trimming</hi> which is very material, and that is the <hi>Trimming</hi> of <hi>Roots;</hi> which is perform'd upon two Occaſions; of which, the one, that is the moſt common, is generally practis'd upon all <hi>Trees,</hi> before they are planted; (which I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently mention'd in the Treatiſe of <hi>Plantations:)</hi> The other, which is extraordinary, is only made uſe of upon ſome on the Place, according as one deſigns to make ſome more, and others leſs vigorous than they are. This I will ſpeak of at the End of this Treatiſe.</p>
                        <p>This Maxim, or Neceſſity of <hi>Pruning</hi> the Heads of all <hi>Trees,</hi> not being <hi>Tall-ſtandards,</hi> being well eſtabliſh'd, tho there are ſome Erroneous Opinions in it, in relation to very vigorous <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> which I ſhall eaſily deſtroy. I think my ſelf indiſpenſibly oblig'd to examine here, as much as in me lies, whatever relates to ſo renown'd a Practice in the Management of <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> therefore I proteſt, at firſt, that I will make no particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to my ſelf; but on the contrary, that I will uſe my utmoſt Endeavour, not to omit any thing whatever of what I have been able to apprehend in it hitherto, and of what I have ſo long practis'd with Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>I am perſuaded that <hi>Pruning</hi> is not only a very uſeful, but alſo a very curious thing, and capable of affording Pleaſure to thoſe that underſtand it: But at the ſame time it muſt be acknowledg'd, that it is likewiſe perpicious, or dangerous, when perform'd by unskilful Hands.</p>
                        <p>For, to ſpeak properly, <hi>Pruning,</hi> in the Senſe we take it, is not barely Cutting; every <note place="margin">Qui cum judicio putat Arborem, efficit, ut quod Arbor ſponte vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit facere, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, when People have not that Abundance of <hi>Fruit</hi> they deſire, and did hope for, the Fault ought not always to be imputed to the <hi>Gard'ner:</hi> He is only blameable when his <hi>Trees</hi> are not-well ſhap'd, when they do not bloſſom abundantly, and when the <hi>Fruit</hi> is not univerſally and equally beautiful, ſo as to ſee, upon one and the ſame <hi>Tree, Fruit</hi> of very different ſizes; for he is partly Maſter of that.</p>

                           <p>Definition of the Pruning of Trees.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>To let you underſtand what this <hi>Pruning</hi> is; I ſay, that it is an Operation of <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> for three Things, which are to be done yearly to <hi>Trees,</hi> betwixt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Month of <hi>November,</hi> and the End of <hi>March:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Firſt is, To take away all thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> that are naught, or might be prejudicial, either to the Abundance, or Goodneſs of the <hi>Fruit;</hi> as alſo to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second, To preſerve all thoſe that may be of good uſe to thoſe <hi>Trees:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the Third, Prudently to clip thoſe that are found too long, and not to cut any thing off thoſe that have not too much length.</p>
                        <p>And all this in order to make a <hi>Tree</hi> laſting, to beautifie it, and at the ſame time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſoon to bear a great deal of fine and good <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By <hi>Branches</hi> that are naught, I mean thoſe that are of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> thoſe that are decay'd by having yielded much <hi>Fruit,</hi> and thoſe that are too ſmall, or have no diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce either <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By <hi>Branches</hi> that may be prejudicial, either to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> Abundance, or Goodneſs of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> I mean ſuch as might cauſe a Confuſion, or ſhadow the <hi>Fruit,</hi> as well as thoſe that take part of the <hi>Sap</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> when it is over-charg'd with <hi>Wood,</hi> compar'd to its Vigour.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Branches</hi> that may be of good Uſe, I mean all thoſe that are ſo well condition'd, as to be fit to contribute to the beautiful Figure of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and Infallibly to produce <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By <hi>Branches</hi> that are too long, I mean ſuch as exceed nine or ten Inches in length, and ſo conſequently want to be ſhorten'd; ſuch are all the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> which we call <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> and ſome of the ſmall ones, which we call <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48210:128"/>
In fine, By <hi>Branches</hi> that have not too much length, I mean certain little <hi>Branches,</hi> which being of a moderate Thickneſs, have <hi>Buds</hi> at the Ends of them, or are in a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having ſome the following Year, and yet are ſtrong enough to bear the Fruit they are to produce, without breaking.</p>
                        <p>This ſo material Diſtinction in point of <hi>Branches,</hi> ſhall be more particularly explain'd in the Chapters that treat of the Manner of <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will ſay nothing here of the Original of <hi>Pruning,</hi> by reaſon that what has been ſaid of it is fabulous, and ridiculous, and conſequently cannot at preſent ſerve for Inſtruction. For Example, What ſignifies it to know, that ſome pretend to derive the Original of <hi>Pruning</hi> from that Province of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was called <hi>Nauptia;</hi> a Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in <hi>Vineyards:</hi> An Aſs having brouz'd or nibbl'd ſome <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> it was obſerv'd that the nibbl'd <hi>Branches</hi> produc'd a great many more <hi>Grapes,</hi> than thoſe that were untouch'd; which made them reſolve thenceforward to ſhorten, or break, or cut, that is, to <hi>prune</hi> all the Branches of <hi>Vines.</hi> It is moreover reported, that ſo much Succeſs attended this Experiment, that to expreſs their Acknowledgment of ſo fine an Invention, they erected in one of the fineſt Places of that Province, a Marble Statue to that Animal, as to the Author of <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines;</hi> that is to ſay, to the Author of the Abundance of Wine. And our Books tell us, that this is the true Reaſon of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s being drawn mounted upon an Aſs.</p>
                        <p>The Uſefulneſs of <hi>Pruning</hi> Vines being viſible; it was judg'd from thence, that it would not be leſs advantageous to <hi>prune Fruit-Trees;</hi> and thus, in the Beginnings, they did in this, as has been done in all other Arts and Sciences, they begun to cut groſly, that is, to <hi>prune</hi> ſome of the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> till by degrees they have ſtudy'd to refine upon it; and, even in theſe Days, People ſtill ſtudy, by Reaſon and Obſervation, to improve, and render themſelves more and more perfect in it. This is the Information we receive from Books, as to the Original of <hi>Pruning:</hi> It will eaſily be granted, that this is not a very material Thing. But, What is very neceſſary to be known,</p>
                        <p>Are three principal Points; without the underſtanding of which, it ſeems impoſſible to me, either to ſpeak well of this <hi>Pruning,</hi> or to perform it.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The Firſt relates to the Reaſons for which it is done.</item>
                           <item>The Second, To the Time in which it muſt be done.</item>
                           <item>And the Third relates to the Manner of doing it with Skill and Succeſs.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Let us examine theſe three Points, one after another.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="chapter">
                        <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Reaſons of Pruning.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Will begin with the Reaſons for which <hi>Pruning</hi> is uſed, which, in my Opinion, are two. The Firſt, and chief, is, That which <hi>Pruning</hi> aims at, The ſpeedy getting of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fine and good <hi>Fruit;</hi> without which, no <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> would be had, or culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
                        <p>The Second, which is pretty conſiderable, informs us, That <hi>Pruning</hi> ſerves to make <hi>Trees,</hi> in all Seaſons, even in thoſe in which they have neither <hi>Fruit</hi> nor <hi>Leaves,</hi> appear more agreeable to Sight, than they would do if they were not <hi>prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, the Satisfaction of the Sight in this laſt Point depends wholly upon the well-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and well-proportion'd Figure, a skilful Hand is capable of giving to each <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, as to what relates to the Abundance of fine and good <hi>Fruit,</hi> as much as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> can contribute to it, it depends firſt upon the Knowledge he muſt have of every <hi>Branch</hi> in particular, to know thoſe that are good, from thoſe that are not: It depends, in the ſecond place, upon the judicious Diſtinction which is to be made among the <hi>Branches,</hi> wholly to take away thoſe that are bad, or uſeleſs, and carefully to preſerve all the good ones, be they <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit;</hi> with this caution, that if among theſe laſt, ſome be found not too long, they ſhall be left as they are: But as to the main, of the others which are too long, they muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> more or leſs, according as Reaſon may require, either as to the Abundance, or even to the Figure of the <hi>Tree.</hi> This abundance depends, in the third Place, upon the proper time of <hi>Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> all times not being fit for it.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the two firſt Heads, which relate to the Knowledge and Diſtinction of <hi>Branches</hi> in general, I ſhall ſhew hereafter in what Order, and to what Uſe Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them upon <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> how ſome are uſeful for one thing, others for another, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48210:129"/>
chiefly how ſome have more Diſpoſition to Fructify, and others leſs; and ſhall conclude from thence, that it is according to that Order, and that Intention of Nature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that more or leſs Diſpoſition, that thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be Order'd and <hi>Prun'd</hi> in a different manner, the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>But before I enter any farther into that matter, which has a great extent, ſince I muſt therein explain, eſpecially the Manner, or Rules that muſt be practis'd in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of a great number of <hi>Trees,</hi> which commonly are very different the one from the other; I think, it will not be improper to ſay firſt, and as briefly as I can, what I think of the Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> ſince that Article is ſooneſt decided.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Time of Pruning.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THere is but little to be ſaid upon the Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> becauſe that by a general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, it is commonly fix'd to the End of Winter, or at the Beginning of the Spring; that is, a little before the <hi>Trees</hi> ſprout, and partly about the time that the <hi>Buds</hi> begin to ſwell, in order to become <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> and the others to ſtretch out to become Branches: Which happens infallibly, after the great Colds (which generally attend the Months of <hi>November, December, January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> are paſt;) the Spring coming in, and conſequently the Air beginning to grow hot, and mild, the <hi>Plants,</hi> that had wholly ceas'd to act during four Months, begin, as it were, to waken, and really to enter into Action: That firſt Motion is conſtantly perform'd at the Head, before it begins at the <hi>Roots;</hi> that is to be underſtood, when the Cold has been ſo great, as to interrupt their Function; for among us, in mild Winters, there is not much more Interruption, than in very hot Countries. We ſhall ſhew this Order in another place. This External Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Action is a certain Sign that it is time to <hi>prune.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>People were formerly ſo ſcrupulous as to the preciſe Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> that they durſt not abſolutely labour about it, but in the Decreaſe of the Moons of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March:</hi> It was almoſt the only Maxim, in that Caſe, that appear'd well eſtabliſh'd, and was in effect inviolably obſerved. It may be ſaid, that it was a kind of Rote, which moſt <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> affected with an incredible Obſtinacy; or rather, that it was a kind of Tyranny, which they exercis'd, when they were employ'd by Gentlemen who were Lovers of their <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> That Cuſtom was grown to that heighth, that both the one and the other would have thought all loſt, had any thing been <hi>prun'd</hi> out of thoſe Declinings: It was an Epidemical Diſtemper; of which, there are ſtill but too many ill Remains. I grant that in other things that are above my Reach, and in which I have no Inſight, it may be neceſſary to obſerve the Motions of the Moon; but as to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has any relation to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> I will take upon me to ſhew hereafter, in a Treatiſe of ſome Reflections I have made upon <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that thoſe Obſervations are not only vain, but even Chimerical. And whereas I was formerly infected with that Opinion my ſelf, and am now fully diſabus'd of it, I do not deſpair of ridding <hi>Gard'ners</hi> of that kind of Notion, or Ignorance, and at the ſame time cure the Diſquiets of ſeveral ingenious Men upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that it is very good to <hi>prune</hi> at the End of <hi>February,</hi> and at the Beginning <note place="margin">Omnis Arborum putatio quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque fieri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt à tempore caſus foliorum. <hi>Creſcentius.</hi>
                           </note> of <hi>March,</hi> which are commonly Times of Decreaſe; but it is likewiſe as true, that without minding the Moon, one may begin to <hi>prune</hi> as ſoon as the Leaves of the <hi>Trees</hi> are faln; that is, at the End of <hi>October,</hi> or, at leaſt, about the Middle of <hi>November;</hi> which may be continu'd afterwards for the whole Winter, until all be done. And, becauſe that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly three ſorts of <hi>Trees</hi> to <hi>prune;</hi> the one too weak, the other too vigorous, and the others that are in as good a Caſe as can be deſir'd, I am of Opinion that it may be both prudent and uſeful, not to <hi>prune</hi> them all at the ſame time; and that it is proper to <hi>prune</hi> ſome ſooner, and others later. For Example, I am ſufficiently perſuaded, that the weaker, and more languiſhing a <hi>Tree</hi> is, the ſooner it ought to be <hi>prun'd,</hi> to take from it betimes thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> which, as noiſom and uſeleſs, muſt be taken from it at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; that is, towards the End of the Winter. And this is the Reaſon why the <hi>Pruning</hi> in <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>January</hi> is very good and wholeſom in relation to theſe; and even better than that of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March.</hi> And, by the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, the ſtronger and more vigorous a <hi>Tree</hi> is, the longer the <hi>Pruning</hi> of it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd; I mean, as to ſuch an one, that the <hi>Pruning</hi> of it may not only ſafely, but alſo very uſefully be deferr'd until the End of <hi>April.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48210:129"/>
I advance in this, two Principles, which appear pretty new: Thoſe that are deſirous to ſee the certain Proof of it, may continue to read what follows: As for thoſe who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to rely upon my Word and Experience, and are only deſirous to ſee the Sequel of my manner of Practiſing, they may skip over the Remainder of this Chapter, to proceed to that wherein I explain the Reaſons why <hi>Pruning</hi> is neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>To eſtabliſh the two Principles I have heretofore advanc'd, I make uſe of two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, whereof the firſt, which relates to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of weak <hi>Trees,</hi> is drawn from the Conduct of certain frugal Millers, who, with a ſmall quantity of Water, find the Means to manage a Mill that requires a great deal. The Second, which relates to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of very vigorous <hi>Trees,</hi> is taken from other Millers, who knowing how dangerous great Streams of Riſing Waters are to their Mills, for a Time ſuffer the Abundance of Water; which might annoy them, to flow gently by; and the Violence of it being over, they ſhut their Sluce, or Water-gate, and afterwards employ the Remainder of their Water; according as may be expedient for the Number of Wheels they are to ply.</p>
                        <p>For the Underſtanding of theſe two Compariſons, I ſay, that the <hi>Sap</hi> in every <hi>Tree</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be partly the ſame as Water is in every River: I will ſay in another place, what Water is in the Pipes of ſpouting Fountains.</p>
                        <p>Whether Rivers be large or ſmall, it is ſtill certain that they are beautiful, provided that the Channel of each, whatever it may be, be commonly furniſh'd with a quantity of Water proportionable to it; without which, they are miſerable, and of no Conſideration: So is a <hi>Tree</hi> likewiſe eſteem'd beautiful, whatever Size it be of, (there being both Great and Small,) provided that <hi>Tree</hi> yearly produces ſufficient fine <hi>ſhoots;</hi> from all its Parts; and in quantity, proportionable to its preſent heighth and thickneſs, or bulk; without which, a <hi>Tree</hi> is certainly both ugly and miſerable.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that while a <hi>Tree</hi> is in a good <hi>Ground,</hi> and well, the Weather not being ſo cold, as to freeze the <hi>Ground</hi> as far as the <hi>Roots;</hi> for ſuch a Cold ſtops all manner of <hi>vegetation;</hi> in ſuch a caſe, the extremities of the old <hi>Roots,</hi> ſtill produce other new ones, and conſequently ſtill produce a new <hi>Sap,</hi> as I prove in my <hi>Reflections,</hi> and ſo there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually riſes a <hi>Sap,</hi> both into the <hi>Stem</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and in all the <hi>Branches</hi> which compoſe the head or top of it; and this, more or leſs in the whole extent of each, according as the <hi>Sap</hi> is in it ſelf more or leſs abounding; juſt as it is in a River, while the Source is good, and no ways obſtructed, the Water flows continually, not only in the Bed or Channel, which Art and Nature have provided for it, but alſo, generally into all the Branches into which it may divide it ſelf; that is to ſay, into all the Brooks, or Rivulets, which may form themſelves along its courſe, and that more or leſs, according as that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in it ſelf more or leſs abounding.</p>
                        <p>When we find that a <hi>Tree</hi> has but little vigour, and produces no fine <hi>Shoots;</hi> or that having been vigorous the preceeding Years, it ceaſes to be ſo, ſo as to produce no more <hi>Shoots,</hi> or at leaſt, none but very ſmall and inconſiderable ones, we may ſay that it is an Infallible mark, either, that the Source of the <hi>Sap</hi> is Naturally weak and ſmall, or that it is become ſo; ſo that being no longer capable of performing any effect in long <hi>Branches,</hi> nor in many, and yet it being neceſſary it ſhould produce ſome for our Profit and Satisfaction; we muſt betimes eaſe that <hi>Tree</hi> of its burthen, which is too great, conſidering its want of Strength and Vigour, and ſo conſequently betimes, wholly cut off a great part of its <hi>Branches,</hi> to the end, that we may, as ſoon as poſſibly can be, ſtop many of thoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures through which part of the <hi>Sap</hi> of that <hi>Tree</hi> did enter; and ſo that, which for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, being divided into forty <hi>boughs</hi> ſeem'd to produce but little effect in each, the ſame being afterwards contracted, and diſtributed into half the quantity, will be found ſufficient to perform much greater Productions upon that <hi>Tree,</hi> tho' indeed leſs numerous: It was like a River, whoſe Source or Spring, was either Naturally weak, or conſiderably diminiſh'd, and which, notwithſtanding that being yet divided into too many <hi>Branches;</hi> could not perform any thing conſiderable in any of them; but the ſame being induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contracted, or reduc'd, and kept within narrow bounds, ſo that for the future no part of it may be loſt, as it us'd to be; is thereby enabl'd, at leaſt to turn ſome Wheel. A Dam, or Sluce made betimes, have perform'd in this, what the good Fortune of a more abounding River would have done, as to ſeveral Wheels.</p>
                        <p>This Reaſon has induc'd me to advice the <hi>Pruning</hi> of weak <hi>Trees</hi> betimes, and the ſame Reaſon informs us, that they muſt be cut very ſhort, as we will demonſtrate hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Now, that which is a convincing Argument, in relation to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of theſe, muſt, in my Opinion, by the Rule of contraries, ſerve to direct us as to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> be it either to do it later, or to leave a greater burthen upon each of them.</p>
                        <p>It is moſt certain, that we only have <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> in order to have <hi>Fruit;</hi> and it is as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48210:130"/>
certain, that <hi>Fruit</hi> commonly grows upon thoſe weak <hi>Branches</hi> only; the large ones bear but little, their Function being to perform ſomething elſe, which is very conſiderable: Thus great Torrents are not fit to grind, on the contrary, they are apt to choak or ſtop up a Mill, or to break all; their Function is to ſerve to other things; for inſtance, for the Tranſportation of Travellers, Burthens, Merchandiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that none but thoſe that are moderate, can be uſeful for Grinding; So likewiſe, a <hi>Tree</hi> being very vigorous, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally produces none but large <hi>Branches,</hi> eſpecially at the beginning of the Spring, at which time the <hi>Sap</hi> riſes moſt, and can begin none of thoſe weak ones, which we ſtand in need of for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> that muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> in order to yield <hi>Fruit,</hi> and yet retain a pleaſing Figure; you muſt not only leave a great burthen, whether it be as to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Branches,</hi> or the length of every one of them, which is certainly abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but there muſt be ſomething more: And as it is particularly on thoſe extremities, that the new <hi>Sap</hi> performs moſt at the entrance of the Spring, it is neceſſary, as one may ſay, to let the heat and fury of its firſt Action diſcharge it ſelf: And therefore it is fit to <hi>Prune</hi> ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> later; that is, it muſt not be done until the firſt impetuoſity of the <hi>Sap</hi> be paſs'd; there will yet remain enough in it, to make thoſe kind of <hi>Branches</hi> ſo <hi>Prun'd,</hi> afterwards ſhoot out, at the ſame time, both large <hi>Shoots</hi> for the Figure, and of thoſe ſmall ones which we deſire for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Not but that, as I will ſhew hereafter, the beſt Expedient in relation to very vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> and even, if I may expreſs my ſelf ſo, obſtinate in point of <hi>Fruit;</hi> I ſay, the beſt Expedient, is to go to the Source of their Vigour, which are the <hi>Roots:</hi> It is that Vigour which muſt be weaken'd, and conſequently the moſt working <hi>Roots:</hi> diminiſh'd, and thereby you will diminiſh the effect which proceeds from ſeveral good Labourers; which acting at one and the ſame time, produce more <hi>Sap</hi> than is requir'd to ſuch a <hi>Fruit-Tree:</hi> For, in fine, that <hi>Tree</hi> muſt according to our intention, quickly bear <hi>Fruit</hi> in a conſtrain'd Figure, the which is in no wiſe Natural to it; which it cannot do, when the <hi>Sap,</hi> being over abundant, produces every where, none but over large <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Experience which every one may acquire in the practice of theſe two Maxims, and particularly that which relates to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of weak <hi>Trees;</hi> that Experience, I ſay, will perfectly eſtabliſh them for ever; and as for other <hi>Trees,</hi> I engage that every body will find a benefit by it; and I affirm, above all things, that it will be a great help to all <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who are to mannage great <hi>Fruit-Gardens;</hi> and who, as it is very much to be wiſh'd, will <hi>Prune</hi> the greateſt part of their <hi>Trees</hi> themſelves.</p>
                        <p>As I am of Opinion, that they can do no better than to follow this Advice, ſo they appear to me very blame-worthy, if they tarry to the end of Winter, and the time of thoſe decreaſes of the Moons, of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> to begin to <hi>Prune;</hi> becauſe, that is the greateſt time of hurry for all manner of work relating to <hi>Gard'ners:</hi> All comes at once at the entrance of the Spring; the Tillage of the whole <hi>Garden,</hi> the Sowing of moſt <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> the Budding of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> the making of the different <hi>Beds,</hi> the cleanſing of the Walks; ſo that it is a ſtrange confuſion, to have at the ſame time, the moſt conſiderable of all Works to do; for it is the only one, in which no ſmall faults can be committed, they are all conſiderable and pernicious; it is the <hi>Pruning</hi> of many <hi>Trees,</hi> and perhaps large <hi>Trees, Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> without omitting the firſt palliſading of theſe; and whereas in that caſe, all things are done in a hurry, ſo they are commonly ill enough done: For to ſpeak the Truth, every thing requiring an equal haſte to be done, there are but few to which a Man can give that time, and application, which they require.</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid by the by, that I did no ways matter the decreaſe of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have not anſwer'd an Objection which ſome <hi>Gard'ners</hi> pretend to be invincible, and in which, in my Opinion, they are infinitely deceiv'd; it is, ſay they, That the Winter Froſt may ſpoil the extremities of the <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Prun'd;</hi> and that if it be not to be fear'd <hi>ſo much</hi> for <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> yet at leaſt it is very dangerous for <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the Wood of thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> is very tender, becauſe it is very pithy; I will only deſire thoſe ſcrupulous Perſons, to lay aſide that apprehenſion, and I aſſure them, that the Experiment they will make of it, without prejudice, will fully cure them of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; we have had within theſe Seven or Eighth Years, the hardeſt Winters in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any Living Man. I had <hi>Prun'd</hi> my <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> before that great Cold, and I never found the leaſt inconveniency by it.</p>
                        <p>I am fully perſwaded, that it is ſafe to <hi>Prune</hi> as often as the Cold is not ſo violent, as perſonally to prejudice the <hi>Pruner;</hi> there are only certain days of white or hoary Froſt, in which the Wood being altogether cover'd with a rimy Froſt, the <hi>Pruning-knife,</hi> tho' never ſo ſharp, cannot cut through it cleverly; and ſo, whereas a Man ought to <hi>Prune</hi>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48210:130"/>
with delight; to do it well, 'tis certainly impoſſible at that time, and therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to defer <hi>Pruning,</hi> until that Froſt be altogether melted and gone.</p>
                        <p>The proper times for <hi>Pruning</hi> being regulated, we muſt proceed to ſomething more Material and Curious.</p>
                        <p>As nothing is more creditable and Natural for a Workman, than to know certainly, why, and for what Reaſon, he does the Work he is employ'd about; ſo I am perſwaded, that nothing can be more ſtupid, and below a Man, than to Act barely by Cuſtom, and Habit: It is a fault which is but too common amongſt moſt <hi>Gard'ners;</hi> they ſeldom <hi>Prune</hi> for any other Reaſon, than that it is cuſtomary. I am convinc'd that there is an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpencible Neceſſity of knowing ſomething more; without which, it is impoſſible ever to attain to any perfection in <hi>Pruning,</hi> which in my Opinion is an undeniable Truth: I cannot endure that a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> ſhould be puzzl'd, and almoſt quite at a loſs, when any body deſires to know the Reaſons of his <hi>Pruning:</hi> And that is the Subject I intend to Treat of in the following Chapter.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Reaſons that oblige to <hi>Prune.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE have two principal Reaſons, which Preſcribe and Authoriſe <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Firſt is, To be ſure to have a greater abundance of fine Fruit, and ſooner.</p>
                        <p>The Second is, To render the <hi>Tree</hi> at all times more agreeable to ſight, than it would be, if it were not <hi>Prun'd:</hi> It is undeniable, that it is not only the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Leaves</hi> that render a <hi>Tree</hi> beautiful: They are indeed its greateſt Ornaments, but there is ſomething more requir'd; ſince the <hi>Fruit</hi> not remaining upon it all the Year round, it were to be wiſh'd, that when it is ſtript of thoſe Adornments, or is not yet old enough to have them all; it may at leaſt be compos'd, and ſhap'd ſo, as to delight the Eye.</p>
                        <p>Now that which, beſides the importance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> renders a <hi>Tree</hi> pleaſing to the Eye, is nothing but the beautiful Figure a skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> can give to it: And whereas we have two ſorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> upon which particularly we Exerciſe <hi>Pruning,</hi> to wit <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> we muſt eſtabliſh good Principles to proceed prudently upon both: Thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples relate particularly to the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> without which we cannot have beautiful <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> and by means of which it is eaſie, and even Infallible, to attain to a perfection in it; the whole Myſtery of that Operation, ſhall be diſcover'd in the Chapters that Treat of the manner of <hi>Pruning Dwarfs;</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> there being no other Rules for the one than for the other.</p>
                        <p>I ſay firſt, That for thoſe two ſorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> it muſt be granted, that their Figures being ſo oppoſite the one to the other, the Beauty conſequently muſt needs be ſo too, therefore I think it will not be amiſs, to ſhew in what, particularly, I faney, that thoſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind of Beauties may conſiſt.</p>
                        <p>And perhaps, after that, it will not be improper to compare, in that reſpect, a good <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> to a skilful <hi>Carver;</hi> For as the latter, conformably to the Idea which fills his Imagination, ought at firſt ſight, to behold in his Marble, the Figure he deſigns to work out of it, and conſequently to behold diſtinctly in it, the place of every particular Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which it is to be compos'd.</p>
                        <p>So an Underſtanding <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> conformably to the Idea he ſhall have fram'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> muſt at a view behold whatever is to be done in any Tree, either to beautifie it, when it is not ſo, or to preſerve it in its Beauty, when it has acquir'd it; whether it be to render it uſeful; or, for Example, to ſee where the <hi>Fruit</hi> ſhall be, and conſequently the <hi>Branches</hi> that ſhall produce it; to obſerve the <hi>Branches</hi> that muſt be taken off, and thoſe that muſt be preſerv'd, to give it an agreeable Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as from time to time, the <hi>Carver</hi> draws back from his Work, to ſee whether he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd or executed his Thought well; ſo a skilful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> in <hi>Pruning</hi> his <hi>Tree,</hi> ought to do the ſame thing; that is, to draw back from it, from time to time, to ſee whether he has really hit upon the beautiful Figure he deſigns to give it.</p>
                        <p>But before we enter into the explication of that Idea, or Notion of Beauty in <hi>Trees,</hi> it will be neceſſary to remember, That, as I have ſaid in my Treatiſe of <hi>Plantations,</hi> we have but few of thoſe that are call'd <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> that Naturally remain <hi>Low, Dwarfiſh,</hi> and, as I may ſay, <hi>Creeping</hi> enough, either to make regular <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or yet leſs, to make <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> All <hi>Trees,</hi> following the Inclination which Nature has given them, endeavour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48210:131"/>
to riſe, and conſequently 'tis only the Induſtry of the <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who oppoſing the Courſe of Nature, hinders them from forming long <hi>Stems,</hi> and from growing Tall.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Gard'ners</hi> knowing that, as we have already ſaid, the <hi>Sap</hi> which is to form thoſe <hi>Stems,</hi> lies partly in the <hi>Trees;</hi> much in the ſame manner, as the water which is to form the Spouts of Water-Works, lies in the Pipes: They have concluded from thence, that if they ſtopp'd the Paſſage which carries this <hi>Sap</hi> upwards, which is eaſie to do, by ſhort'ning the <hi>Stems</hi> of the <hi>Trees,</hi> there wou'd be no further likelyhood of its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a <hi>Standard;</hi> and ſo that <hi>Sap</hi> which is in motion, or ſtrives to get out, without any poſſibility of being prevented, finding no longer a paſſage to riſe up, as it ought, will diſcharge it ſelf at the place where its Courſe has been interrupted, and will produce the ſame effect there, it would have done higher, had it had the liberty of aſcending further; ſo that this <hi>Sap</hi> ſpringing out of the ſides, not only by many Overtures, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready actually form'd there, but likewiſe by or through others, that it will make it ſelf, proportionably as it is abundant, it will produce to the right and left a pretty conſiderable quantity of fine <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I muſt now tell you, that if the <hi>Tree</hi> that is ſhorten'd be Planted in the open Air, it may be diſpos'd to make a fine <hi>Dwarf;</hi> and if near any Wall, to make a fine <hi>Wall-Tree.</hi> I have alſo explain'd in the ſame <hi>Treatiſe of Plantations</hi> what is a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> and what a <hi>Wall-Tree.</hi> I have there ſhewn what was the Intention of thoſe that firſt made them, and of what uſe they may be to us. I have likewiſe declar'd in it, that when the Walls are high, you muſt Plant Long Body'd <hi>Trees</hi> to garniſh the top of the Wall; and that inſtead of leaving them there the liberty of forming a round <hi>Tree,</hi> as they wou'd do were they left at liberty, their <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be conſtrain'd, like thoſe of the <hi>Trees</hi> that are ſhorten'd, as we will demonſtrate; after having firſt explain'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Beauty both of the one and the others does conſiſt; I mean, of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Beauty of <hi>Dwarfs</hi> requires two Conditions, the one in reſpect to the <hi>Stem,</hi> and the other of the Head: According to the firſt Condition, <hi>Dwarfs</hi> muſt be low <hi>Stem;</hi> and according to the ſecond, they muſt have an open Head, that is, free from thick <hi>Branches</hi> in the middle; it muſt be round in its Circumference, and equally furniſh'd with good <hi>Branches</hi> on the ſides.</p>
                        <p>I will explain more particularly hereafter what I mean by that Opening of the <hi>Middle,</hi> and it ſhall be in the place where I ſhall give Directions how to attain to it; but in the mean time a Man muſt have a right apprehenſion of the four Conditions of that Figure, and be fully perſwaded of it, in order to underſtand uſefully my Maxims of <hi>Pruning,</hi> and grow Skilful in them, in caſe he approves them ſo well, as to be willing to Practiſe them.</p>
                        <p>I ſay nothing as yet of the heighth of the Head of thoſe <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> it depends on the Age of the Trees, being low in thoſe that are yet young, and riſing in all according as they grow: But as much as is poſſible, I wou'd not willingly have it exceed Six or Seven Foot: It being better, in my Opinion, that thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> ſhou'd grow in extent of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and Breadth, than to let them riſe high. The Pleaſure of Sight, which dreads whatever Limits it too much, particularly in <hi>Gardens,</hi> beſides the Perſecution of the Winds, which eaſily beats down the <hi>Fruit</hi> of High <hi>Trees,</hi> makes me fix to that meaſure. As the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Dwarfs</hi> is incomparably more difficult, and conſequently contains a great many more Rules than the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi> I will begin with that, before I ſpeak of the other.</p>

                        <p>TO advance our <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> to that perfection of Beauty which beſt becomes them; I am of Opinion, that it muſt be our particular care, that all the <hi>Branches</hi> of each <hi>Tree,</hi> in ſpreading over the ſides of that part of the Wall which they are to garniſh; muſt be ſo well ſtretch'd, and ſo equally plac'd, both on the right and leſt; that in their whole extent, taking them from the place, whence they ſeverally proceed, as far as all the extremities of their heighth and roundneſs, no part of the <hi>Tree</hi> may appear thinner or fuller than another; in ſo much, that at firſt ſight, one may diſtinctly ſee all the Branches that compoſe it, ſo far as to be able, to tell them with eaſe, if ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Thinneſs is the greateſt imperfection of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> as fulneſs is the greateſt fault of <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> when I ſay, that I would have my <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> full, I do not mean, that they ſhould be full of ill <hi>Branches,</hi> old, worn, or uſeleſs, as a great many ignorant Perſons affect to have them; neither on the other hand, in deſiring my <hi>Dwarfs</hi> to be open in the middle, would I have them empty, like the inſide of a Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do particularly deſire all <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> to be very mindful of theſe two Ideas of Beauty.</p>
                        <p>As to the Beauty of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> it is certainly diſagreeable, to ſee their <hi>Branches</hi> croſſing one another, which muſt be avoided as much as is poſſible; but whereas thinneſs, as I have already ſaid, is in my Opinion, the defect the moſt contrary to the Beauty of thoſe kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> I am for endeavouring to avoid it above all things; ſo that for that Reaſon, I will have it allow'd, nay and order'd too, to run them over one another in ſome occaſions, and that particularly it may be allow'd for the great Branches, which are alone the foundation of all the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> to be ſometimes drawn over ſmall ones, or the ſmall ones over them, otherwiſe it would be impoſſible to avoid the danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the diſagreeable inconvenience of that unlucky Barrenneſs.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe little <hi>Branches,</hi> which we may in ſome manner look upon here, as Temporary <hi>Branches;</hi> are commonly, as we have ſaid, the only ones that muſt yield <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that is the Reaſon, why they have been carefully and preciouſly preſerv'd; but whereas, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having given that <hi>Fruit,</hi> they muſt infallibly periſh; they will be ſoon retrench'd from our <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and conſequently they will ſoon ſupercede the reproach of croſſing, they may have drawn upon the <hi>Gard'ner;</hi> and he ſhall thereby be freed from another reproach, which is much more to be fear'd, and that is the want of <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So then, that croſſing muſt not be us'd, unleſs there be an abſolute neceſſity; inſomuch that when it can be avoided, I condemn the <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who, either through Ignorance, or Negligence, have thereby deſtroy'd the agreeable Simetry their <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> might have had.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe, that, in the firſt place, the only way of giving every one of thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> the Beauty, which I have been ſpeaking of, is by means of <hi>Pruning;</hi> and that in the ſecond place, every <hi>Tree</hi> being compos'd of two Parts; of which the one is call'd the <hi>Stock</hi> or <hi>Stem,</hi> and the other the <hi>Branches;</hi> it is certainly upon thoſe two parts, that the <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be perform'd, but yet much more upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> than upon the <hi>Stem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauſe, that chiefly in <hi>Trees,</hi> there are, as we have ſaid, ſeveral kind of <hi>Branches,</hi> very different the one from the other, all having their particular Reaſons, either to be taken away, or preſerv'd; and among thoſe that are to be preſerv'd, ſome are to be ſhorten'd, becauſe they are too long, and others to remain whole; ſo conſequently, there muſt be a great deal of care taken, for the well mannaging of them both.</p>
                        <p>I do think my ſelf indiſpenſably oblig'd, to endeavour to unravel, if poſſible, all the diſtinctions that are to be made among thoſe <hi>Branches;</hi> or otherwiſe it will not be poſſible to underſtand the Maxims I deſign to eſtabliſh for <hi>Pruning</hi> well.</p>
                        <p>I am of Opinion, that I muſt take the ſame Method in this, as People do in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Read: The Firſt thing, is to learn the Letters of the Alphabet: The Second, how to uſe thoſe Letters, to joyn two or three together, to form ſillables; And, in fine, the Third, to Learn the Union of many Sillables, in order to make whole Words; and theſe Words following each other afterwards, compoſe both the Line and Page, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſame manner, will I firſt Teach, how to underſtand well the <hi>Branches</hi> of our <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> giving them Names that may expreſs what they are, and then the Uſe and peculiar Function of each of them; to the end, that ſeveral of them, being well plac'd,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48210:132"/>
may render the <hi>Trees</hi> Beautiful, and diſpoſe them ſoon to yield abundance of good <hi>Fruit.</hi> Perhaps on the occaſion of this Compariſon, it would not be improper to ſay; that as in Reading, Words are only form'd by the Reciprocal Function of the Vowels and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants; ſo our <hi>Trees</hi> only become Beautiful, when they have at one and the ſame time, a reaſonable proportion of <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Fruit-Branches;</hi> ſo that as the Vowels, or Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants aſunder, can form no Words, or Diſcourſe; neither can <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> aſunder, compoſe a Beautiful <hi>Fruit-Tree.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>RIghtly to underſtand the Doctrine of <hi>Branches;</hi> Five material Things muſt be obſerv'd.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That as they compoſe a conſiderable part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> they ſprout out of two parts of it; ſome ſhoot directly out of the main body, and thoſe are the firſt, and may be ſtil'd, the Elder, or Mothers; their number is not conſiderable; the others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are produc'd by theſe, and are as it were the Daughters of theſe Mother-<hi>Branches:</hi> The number of theſe laſt is infinite; for ſucceſſively in their turns, they become every one Mother-<hi>Branches,</hi> to many others.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be noted, in the ſecond place, that from the Body of every <hi>Branch,</hi> when the <hi>Tree</hi> is in a good Caſe, there yearly grow new ones at the extremities of it; and that more or leſs, according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of that <hi>Branch,</hi> which I ſhall call Mother-<hi>Branch,</hi> in relation to the new ones it produceth.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, you muſt obſerve that theſe new <hi>Branches</hi> grow in two different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the one in a Regular Order, which is the beſt, the moſt common, and moſt frequent; the others in an Irregular Order, which is the leaſt common, and leaſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                        <p>That Order, which is moſt common, and the beſt of the Production of the new <hi>Branches,</hi> when they produce more than one, is, that tho' both the one and the other at the ſame time iſſue from the extremities of one that is more Ancient, whether <hi>Prun'd,</hi> or not, they are notwithſtanding regularly all of a different thickneſs, and length; for every one of the higheſt, are always both thicker and longer than any of thoſe that are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under them, drawing nearer to the <hi>Body:</hi> I ſaid, when it produces more than one; for when the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> brings forth but one, the Daughter at the end of the Summer proves as large as the Mother, and is very good; when that Mother yields two, that which is grown from the extremity, which I call the firſt, or higheſt, is thicker and longer than that which is grown immediately beneath it, which I name the ſecond, or loweſt: And in the ſame manner, when the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> produces three, four, five, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the firſt, that is the higheſt, is thicker and longer than the ſecond, ſo the ſecond in the ſame manner exceeds the third, the third the fourth; and ſo by degrees, what ever quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of new <hi>Branches</hi> the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> may produce, as it appears by the Figures.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, it is eaſie to judge, that the Order which is leaſt Common, and worſt in the Production of new <hi>Branches,</hi> is, when the Common Order is inverted, ſo that there are weak ones in the place where there ought to be thick ones; and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there are large ones, where they ought to be weak, and where perhaps there ought to be none; as it appears by the Figure of <hi>Branches</hi> mark'd with a *.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough to know whence the <hi>Branches</hi> proceed, nor the Order in which they come forth; it is requiſite to know, in the fourth place, that as that greater or ſmaller number of <hi>Branches,</hi> depends upon the force or weakneſs of the Mother-<hi>Branch;</hi> I think, that to make my ſelf the better underſtood, it will be ſit to call thoſe ſtrong, which are thick; and to call thoſe weak, which are ſmall; every one of thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> having their Functions Regulated according to their Degrees of Force, or Weakneſs; ſo that they ſeldom incroach upon one another, being wholly apply'd to the diſcharge of the firſt Duty which Nature ſeems to have impos'd upon them, in forming them.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, you muſt note, and this is the moſt Material Point; that among all the <hi>Branches,</hi> whether ſtrong or weak; there are ſome which have the real Character of good, of which a great many muſt be preſerv'd: There are likewiſe ſome which have the real Character of bad ones; for which reaſon, a Name of Reprobation is given them: In regularity, almoſt all theſe laſt ought to be expell'd; let us obſerve how to diſtinguiſh the one certainly from the other.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>To know the difference of Good and Ill <hi>Branches.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE have two Certain and Infallible marks in relation to <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> certainly to diſtinguiſh the good and ill <hi>Branches</hi> from each other, either while they are ſtill upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or when they are cut off: The one depends upon the difference of their Scituation, and Original, and the other from the difference of their <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe that every body knows that there are <hi>Eyes</hi> upon every <hi>Branch,</hi> which are little knotty places, a little elevated above the reſt of the Bark; it is upon thoſe little pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that the Leaves are actually fix'd, as they are ſeen there in the Summer time; or at leaſt ſome have been fix'd there ſome time before, which may either have dropt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or perhaps have been taken off.</p>
                        <p>What we learn by that difference of Scituation, and Original, is firſt, that the <hi>Branches</hi> to be good, muſt abſolutely, and only proceed from the extremities of thoſe which were remaining upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> at the entrance of the Spring, whether they were form'd in the laſt year, or ſome years before; or likewiſe whether the one and the others have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> as is Cuſtomary, or not; as it happens ſometimes, for Example, in <hi>Standard-Trees.</hi> In fine, as we only ſpeak here in relation to Trees that are liable to <hi>Pruning,</hi> it muſt be granted, that it is only from the extremity of <hi>Branches,</hi> tho' never ſo Old, which have been <hi>Prun'd,</hi> at the Seaſon of the laſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> that the New <hi>Branches</hi> muſt proceed: In the ſecond place, what we gather from the difference of Scituation, and Original of new <hi>Branches,</hi> is, That thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> to be good, muſt have been produc'd in the moſt ordinary and moſt common Order of Nature, as we have heretofore explain'd it.</p>
                        <p>From thence two things muſt be concluded: The firſt, that any <hi>Branch</hi> which, inſtead of being grown from the extremity of that which had been form'd the preceeding Summer, or at leaſt from the extremity of that which had been taken ſhorter at the laſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> proceeds from any other part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> be it either from the <hi>Stem,</hi> or ſome other Old <hi>Branch,</hi> that had not been <hi>Prun'd:</hi> I ſay it muſt be concluded, that ſuch a <hi>Branch,</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſize, thick or ſmall, is an ill <hi>Branch,</hi> as I will demonſtrate hereafter.</p>
                        <p>And what muſt be concluded in the ſecond place, is, That any <hi>Branch</hi> which, inſtead of being grown in the good order of Nature, being either thicker or longer than that which is immediately beneath it, drawing towards the Superiour Extremity; it muſt, I ſay, be concluded that ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> is likewiſe nought: It is for thoſe kind of <hi>Branches</hi> that the name of <hi>falſe wood</hi> has been made, to expreſs that thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> are incapable of performing what we deſire; they muſt be us'd altogether in a different manner from the good ones. We will ſet down particular Maxims to that effect.</p>
                        <p>But whereas I do not think it ſufficient to have methinks, pretty intelligibly explain'd the difference of <hi>Branches,</hi> by that which is grounded upon the difference of their Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Original; I will moreover explain the other, which is founded upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their <hi>Eyes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Mark of the good ones by that difference of <hi>Eyes,</hi> requires that in the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> ſhould be thick, and well fed, and very cloſe one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas the mark of the bad ones by thoſe ſame <hi>Eyes,</hi> is that in all the lower part of ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> thoſe <hi>Eyes</hi> are flat, ill fed, and hardly form'd, and very diſtant the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two different Marks, as well by Situations, as by <hi>Eyes,</hi> are eaſily known in the Figures annex'd hereunto <hi>A. B.</hi> in which the ill ones are mark'd with a *.</p>
                        <p>You may ſee both very good, and very bad ones, as well among the thick and ſtrong ones, as among thoſe that are ſmall and feeble. As to theſe, their weakneſs, is ſometimes ſo exceſſive, that like ſapleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> incapable of bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> or at leaſt of nouriſhing and ſuſtaining the weight of their <hi>Fruit,</hi> they muſt be wholly taken off from our <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and eſpecially from the <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> of which the <hi>Branches</hi> are not tack'd; becauſe that to do well, we muſt ſuffer nothing that is not good.</p>
                        <p>The good weak <hi>Branches,</hi> I mean thoſe which being well plac'd, and of a mean thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and length, are as it were proper and certain Inſtruments to produce Speedy, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Good <hi>Fruit,</hi> and are infallibly ſo, provided the Froſt ſpoils nothing, either while they are in <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> or ſoon after the <hi>Fruit</hi> is knit; for ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> ſeldom fail of producing <hi>Bloſſom-</hi>Buds; and beſides, cannot poſſibly ſerve to any end but yielding of <hi>Fruit,</hi> unleſs contrary to the Natural and Common Order of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> they ſhou'd happen to have certain overflowings of <hi>Sap</hi> to thicken them in an extraordinary manner,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48210:135"/>
and ſo alter their Property; that is, convert them into <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſometimes in all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> particulaely in ſuch as have been ill <hi>Prun'd:</hi> I will explain in the Sequel, what Method is fit to be us'd in ſuch Occaſions.</p>
                        <p>The good ſtrong <hi>Branches,</hi> of which the Principal Uſe is firſt to begin, and then continue to give the <hi>Trees</hi> a proper Figure, which they can receive by no other means, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly employ'd in producing yearly on their Extremities other good new <hi>Branches,</hi> ſome ſtrong, and others weak, as it appears by the Figure <hi>A.</hi> And the great Skill of the <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> conſiſts in making a good uſe of both.</p>
                        <p>And to that end, as it is material to preſerve the good weak ones for <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is the peculiar End of <hi>Fruit-Gardens,</hi> it is likewiſe very neceſſary to work prudently to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage our Operations upon the good ſtrong ones: It is true, that it is requiſite to preſerve on the Extremities of every Old <hi>Branch</hi> ſome of thoſe new ſtrong ones that are grown there, but that commonly extends but to a ſmall Number; for Example, to one only; and ſometimes the Mother-<hi>Branch</hi> being extraordinarily Vigorous, it may extend to two, or three; as I will demonſtrate hereafter, in explaining the manner of <hi>Pruning,</hi> for which we muſt have very good Reaſons; for if too many were preſerv'd, we ſhou'd certainly fall into the inconvenience of Confuſion, which inconvenience ſpoils the whole diſpoſition towards <hi>Fruit,</hi> as well as the beauty of the Figure.</p>
                        <p>There is chiefly a great deal of Skill requir'd, to know how to take away entirely all the uſeleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> whether it be becauſe they are worn or ſpent, or becauſe they have no good qualifications; and the ſame concerning thoſe that are to be preſerv'd, to know how to regulate their length proportionably to their Force, and the Vigour of the whole <hi>Tree;</hi> ſo that afterwards every one of them may be able to produce on its Extremity juſt as many good <hi>Branches</hi> as are neceſſary either for the <hi>Fruit,</hi> or for the perfecting the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> or for preſerving it when it is eſtabliſh'd: And this is what we call the Common <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>

                        <p>I likewiſe call <hi>Apple-Trees, graffed</hi> upon <hi>Paradice-Stocks,</hi> weak <hi>Trees;</hi> as alſo early <hi>Cherry-Trees, graffed</hi> upon common <hi>Cherry-Stocks;</hi> as I ſay, that thoſe that are <hi>graffed</hi> upon free Stocks, that is, upon good Wildlings, are ſtrong and vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> theſe

being really capable' of producing and bearing a great deal, and the others but very little.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe in that Senſe, that after having regulated of what thickneſs partly the <hi>Trees</hi> of each kind ought to be, to be proper to be choſen and Planted by a skilful <hi>Gard'ner;</hi> I ſay in that Caſe, obſerving the difference between the one and the other; that for Example, ſuch a <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>Peach-Tree,</hi> in which I find a fitting thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſtrong enough, and ſo will be fit to be Planted: I ſay likewiſe that another <hi>Tree</hi> of that Kind, being of an exceſſive thickneſs, is too ſtrong; and that on the contrary, another of that Kind, in which that neceſſary thickneſs is wanting, is too weak: It is likewiſe in that Senſe, that it may truly be ſaid, that the <hi>Trees</hi> which grow ſlowly, and never grow extream Tall, are the Weakeſt; witneſs the <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> the <hi>Medlar,</hi> the <note place="margin">Aſpices cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatos Pomorum pondere ramos. Ut ſua quod peperit, vix fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Arboronus.</note> 
                           <hi>Hazzle,</hi> or <hi>Nut-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Paradice Apple-Tree, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I maintain two things more in the ſame Senſe.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, That care muſt be taken that the weak <hi>Branch</hi> which is full of <hi>Buds,</hi> be however ſtrong enough to bear the weight of its <hi>Fruit,</hi> becauſe that otherwiſe, if it be too weak, it will break under it; and therefore I maintain that no more muſt be left upon each, than in proportion to the ſtrength it may have to bear it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing I maintain, relates particularly to the <hi>Graffs</hi> that are made Cleft-wiſe, upon which, when a <hi>Branch,</hi> being ſmall at the time of its <hi>Graffing,</hi> becomes afterwards much thicker than before, methinks that it is hard forbearing to ſay that it is grown the ſtronger by it, there being no likelyhood of maintaining, on the contrary, that the thicker it is, the weaker it is.</p>
                        <p>From all I have been ſaying, to explain the ſignification of thoſe words <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Strength, Weak</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> it follows, that they may, according to my ſence, be uſefully employ'd, and diſtinctly underſtood in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, among theſe <hi>Trees,</hi> there are ſome which yearly produce a great quantity of thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and few ſmall ones: There are ſome that produce a reaſonable number of both; and in fine, there are ſome which grow but little either from Foot, or Head; That is, that produce but few new <hi>Roots</hi> under <hi>Ground,</hi> and even thoſe all ſmall ones, and but few new <hi>Branches</hi> above ground, and thoſe likewiſe almoſt all ſhort and ſmall; which are conſequently far from appearing, as they ſay commonly, Fine, Strong, and Vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> but, on the contrary, look, if I may expreſs my ſelf ſo, Sick, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing.</p>
                        <p>This Production of different <hi>Branches,</hi> is only the Work of Nature, which is perform'd innocently, and without the leaſt dependance on the Reaſonings of Philoſophy; and tho' this Production has not been the work of the Meditation of Man, yet it has furniſh'd him a fair Subject to work upon; ſo that we pretend to have drawn great Inſtructions from it, towards the Cultivating and Management of our <hi>Fruit-Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Being then certain, that all the Parts, of which all manner of <hi>Trees</hi> are Compos'd, do not receive an equal quantity of <hi>Sap,</hi> ſince all the <hi>Branches</hi> are not of an equal thickneſs, and length; I mean, ſome being conſiderably thicker, and harder to break, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be ſaid to be ſtronger than others their Neighbours: Being likewiſe certain, that upon the ſame <hi>Trees,</hi> there are certain <hi>Branches,</hi> which are conſiderably ſmaller, and more eaſie to break, and therefore may be ſaid to be weaker than other Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones.</p>
                        <p>It is moreover certain, as I have heretofore offer'd, and 'tis what I have obſerv'd (which perhaps few had done before me) I ſay it is certain, that very ſeldom <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> form themſelves upon thick and ſtrong <hi>Branches;</hi> ſo that, for Inſtance, if a <hi>Pear-Tree</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce none but ſuch, it will commonly bear no <hi>Pears;</hi> whereas, on the contrary, the ſmall and weak <hi>Branches</hi> produce generally a great deal of <hi>Fruit;</hi> inſomuch, that if ſometimes in one and the ſame <hi>Tree</hi> all one ſide appears as it were Pining, in not having produc'd any new <hi>Branches,</hi> or at leaſt but very weak ones: It is obſervable, that that ſide grows ordinarily full of <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> while the other part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which by the abundance of Fine <hi>Branches</hi> appears very Healthy and Vigorous, produces but very few, and often none at all.</p>
                        <p>This Obſervation has put me upon performing two Operations which I have found very ſucceſsful. The firſt is, that when a <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> remains ſeveral years without produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing hardly any thing beſides theſe kind of <hi>Branches</hi> of an extraordinary thickneſs and length; and conſequently bears but little <hi>Fruit:</hi> In that caſe I have found no better and readier way to make it Fruitful, than by the extraordinary <hi>Pruning</hi> I have mention'd heretofore; that is, by applying my ſelf at the beginning of the Spring to the <hi>Source</hi> or <hi>Spring</hi> of that Force and Vigour, which are the <hi>Roots,</hi> in order to diminiſh their Action; and to that end I lay open half the Foot of that <hi>Tree,</hi> and wholly take away one or two,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48210:136"/>
and ſometimes more of the thickeſt and moſt active <hi>Roots</hi> I meet with, and retrench them ſo well from the Place where they grow, that there does not remain the leaſt part capable of performing the leaſt Function of a <hi>Root;</hi> by that means I prevent the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance of the <hi>Sap</hi> for the future, and conſequently render the whole Head leſs Vigorous; whence it follows, that it <hi>Shoots</hi> leſs of theſe thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and more ſmall ones, and thus it is diſpos'd to bear <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond Operation is that, when in the Month of <hi>May</hi> a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhoots out of an extraordinary thickneſs, either in the ordinary Courſe of an old Planted <hi>Tree,</hi> or in the firſt Years of <hi>Graffing,</hi> and that conſequently it will be evident that ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> will be at the ſame time very long, and have no Diſpoſition to bear <hi>Fruit;</hi> this being grounded upon the Reaſon of its <hi>Strength,</hi> or Thickneſs, which proceeds from too great an abundance of <hi>Sap;</hi> in ſuch a caſe, I am of Opinion, that it is eaſie for thoſe that are willing ſo to do; to divide, as I may call it, that Torrent of <hi>Sap;</hi> and whereas inſtead that its whole Tendency was only to the Production of a thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which for the moſt part would he of no Uſe at all, it is eaſie to reduce it, and as it were oblige it to make ſeveral very good ones, whereof one part will be weak for <hi>Fruit,</hi> and others ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently thick for <hi>Wood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that is fit to be done in the Month of <hi>May:</hi> Therefore at that time I cauſe that young thick <hi>Shoot</hi> to be <hi>Pinch'd,</hi> that is broken with the Nail, and leave it no greater length than that of two, three, or four <hi>Eyes</hi> at moſt.</p>
                        <p>Hereafter I will explain the manner, and ſucceſs of ſuch an Operation, after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd what relates to <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before I enter into the particulars of <hi>Pruning;</hi> I ſuppoſe, that we are to <hi>Prune</hi> either young <hi>Trees,</hi> which have never yet felt the <hi>Pruning</hi> Knife; and, for Example, have not been Planted above a Year or two; or Old <hi>Trees,</hi> which have already been <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſeveral Years before.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe beſides, that theſe old <hi>Trees</hi> are in a good condition, as having been govern'd by Perſons of Underſtanding, ſo that they only want being preſerv'd; or elſe that they are in an ill caſe, either for having always been neglected; that is, not <hi>Prun'd;</hi> or elſe, for having been ill <hi>Prun'd;</hi> ſo that it may be neceſſary to endeavour the correcting of their defects.</p>
                        <p>I do not really believe, that I may ſo foreſee all the Caſes of <hi>Pruning,</hi> as without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting one, be able to give Rules for every one that may happen; I am far from being ſo preſumptuous, knowing, that it is almoſt, in this caſe, as it is in Phyſick, and in the matter of Law-Suits: <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Gallen,</hi> with ſo many <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> for the one; <hi>Le Code</hi> and <hi>Le Digeſte,</hi> with ſo many Regulations and Ord'nances for the other, have not been capable of foreſeeing and providing againſt all, nor conſequently to decide all, ſince there daily occur new Caſes: All I pretend, is to give you exact Information of the Method I have practis'd for theſe Thirty Years with an extraordinary application, in which I have been very ſucceſsful; as well as thoſe who underſtand it, and who, in imitation of me, do me the Honour to Practiſe my Maxims.</p>
                        <p>To explain the particulars of this Method, I will divide what I have to ſay into three <hi>Claſſis;</hi> and Firſt, in favour of the Curious, who begin to make New <hi>Plantations,</hi> I will ſpeak of <hi>Trees</hi> newly Planted, upon which I will firſt give General Rules for the well <hi>Pruning</hi> of all the <hi>Shoots,</hi> which every <hi>Tree</hi> ſhall have produc'd; beginning with thoſe of the firſt Year, and ſhall continue in the ſame manner from Year to Year, for five ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Years, in order to ſhew the effect of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of every one of theſe five Years; afterwards I will give other Rules to remedy certain defects, which will happen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, notwithſtanding the firſt cares of a Skilful <hi>Gard'ner:</hi> With all theſe precautions, and this Method, I have ground to believe, that a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who will be tollerably induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may be ſufficiently inſtructed in this matter to underſtand it, to take pleaſure in it, and laſtly, to perfect himſelf in it, by his own practice, as much as he ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for.</p>
                        <p>After having thus labour'd in favour of the Curious, who have made new <hi>Plantations,</hi> and will mannage them themſelves; I will proceed to the other Curious, who all on a ſudden find themſelves Maſters of certain <hi>Gardens,</hi> wherein the <hi>Trees</hi> are old; whether thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> have been for a long time well mannag'd, or ill, either through Ignorance or want of Skill; and I will endeavour to make them apprehend what I would do to them, were I to have the mannagement of them; This will be particularly of uſe to all kind of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who in all Seaſons, caſting their Eyes upon any <hi>Trees</hi> whatever, ſhall not only be deſirous to judge of their good or ill Condition to ſatisfie others; but likewiſe, ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves in <hi>Pruning</hi> of them; or at leaſt, to preſcribe what ſhould be done to them

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Tools that are neceſſary for <hi>Pruning,</hi> and of the manner of uſing them.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Should not need to ſay, that in order to <hi>Prune,</hi> either <hi>Branches</hi> or <hi>Roots,</hi> two good Tools are neceſſarily requir'd, which are a <hi>Pruning</hi> Knife and a Saw, becauſe 'tis no Novelty, ſince every body knows it as well as my ſelf: But whereas, I am not to omit any thing relating to my Subject, I ſhould think my ſelf blame-worthy, if I did not ſpeak of theſe Inſtruments.</p>
                        <p>Beſides that, as I always aim at rend'ring the work eaſie, and that I am a mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to confuſion; I will deſtroy certain Portative Shops, which are a large and great Caſe, ſtuft up with a multitude of pretty large Tools, and conſequently maſſive and heavy, which <hi>Gard'ners</hi> heretofore only us'd at the time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> and call'd it a <hi>Gard'ner</hi>'s Budget: Now inſtead of all this ſtuff, I only deſire theſe two little Tools, which may at all times be carry'd in the Pocket, without receiving the leaſt trouble from their bigneſs or weight; ſo that on all occaſions, People may not be without ſomething about them, to take away in their Walks, whatever may be judg'd fit to be remov'd; otherwiſe it often happens, that certain things remain imperfect, for want of having about one, wherewith to correct it, as ſoon as it is taken notice of.</p>
                        <p>I ſay then, with every body, that the Saw ſerves here, to take off dry and old <hi>Wood,</hi> which is conſequently very hard, and capable of ſpoiling the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> or elſe to take away that which is ill-plac'd, or ſo thick, that it cannot eaſily, and at once be cut off with the <hi>Pruning-Knife.</hi> I ſay next, that this being granted, the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> muſt of neceſſity ſerve to cut off, at one cut, young, lively, tender, and well-plac'd <hi>Wood,</hi> of a moderate thickneſs; ſo that the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> muſt never be us'd upon any thing that would preſently blunt its edge, and for which the Saw is more proper than it; nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employ the Saw to retrench any <hi>Branches,</hi> which one good cut of the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> may cleverly perform.</p>
                        <p>But it is not ſufficient to be agreed upon the Neceſſity and Uſe of theſe two Tools, for the different Occaſions in which they are employ'd; perhaps it will not be uſeleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, to make the deſcription both of the one and the other. I begin by the Figure of the <hi>Pruning-Knives</hi> which I uſe, and which I look upon as the moſt convenient; for they are made ſeveral ways which I do not approve of, ſome being too hooked, in reſpect to their length, and others not enough; ſo that in my Opinion, neither the one nor the other are near ſo eaſie to work with, as thoſe which keep a medium between theſe two Figures; I have often try'd them of all kinds, and have at laſt fix'd upon theſe that are figur'd here, which perhaps are of my own Invention; at leaſt I have taken a great deal of pains to bring the Workmen to make them exactly according to the Model which I had given them, they ſtill made them too crooked or too ſtreight, and conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient; ſo that in this Caſe, the Figure of the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> is conſiderable.</p>
                        <p>However, it is not enough to have the <hi>Pruning-Knives</hi> well ſhap'd; beſides that, their matter muſt be of good temper'd Steel, ſo that the edge may neither turn, or notch eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they muſt be well whetted, often clean'd from the filth that faſtens upon them in working, and ſet as often as the edge is obſerv'd not to run ſmoothly in cutting eaſily, in proportion to the ſtrength apply'd to them; and beſides, when there are many <hi>Trees</hi> to cut, 'tis fit to have many <hi>Pruning-Knives,</hi> to change them often; for without doubt, with good Tools, more work is done in one Day, and with more Pleaſure, than could be done in two or three, having but indifferent ones, and yet worſe having bad ones.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this, the Blade of theſe <hi>Pruning-Knives</hi> muſt be of a moderate length, that is, but about two Inches to the part where the bending of the back begins, and afterwards, the whole hooked part to the extremity of the point, muſt have two Inches more, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the extent of the outſide, muſt not have above four Inches in all; beſides this, the Handle muſt be more ſquare than round, and a little rugged: Buck's-Horn is very fit for it; this Handle muſt be of a reaſonable bigneſs, ſo as to ſit the hand, and to hold it firm without turning, or ſlipping out of it, in putting ones ſtrength to it; the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48210:138"/>
thickneſs of two Inches and eight Lines, or at moſt three Inches, is that which is fit for the uſe of a Man who actually <hi>Prunes</hi> all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> that is, to cut here and there ſome ſmall <hi>Branches:</hi> Such are fit for Gentlemen to have, to cut, as they are walking, ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> as they obſerve to be ill-plac'd. This is all I can ſay of the Conditions of a good <hi>Pruning-Knife.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Saw,</hi> in my Opinion it does not require ſo much ado; however its moſt commendable quality is to be ſtreight: It muſt be of a very hard Mettal, and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd; old blades of Swords are very fit for it, and the Teeth muſt be of a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and well open'd, the one turning towards one ſide, the other on the 'tother, and the back muſt be very thin, or at leaſt not ſo thick nor ſo ſubſtantial as the Teeth; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Saw</hi> will not move eaſily, becauſe the Teeth will ſoon be fill'd up, ſo that it will ſoon tire him that uſes it, and make the Work advance but little.</p>
                        <p>It is not neceſſary that the <hi>Saws</hi> for the common uſe of <hi>Pruning</hi> ſhou'd be broad, half an Inch in breadth will ſuffice, they muſt not be very long neither, five or ſix Inches in length will do; and as for the handle it may be round; ſince it is to be puſh'd in a ſtreight Line before one, that ſo its turning in the hand need not be fear'd, as a <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> with a Round Handle wou'd do. It will be thick enough, provided in that part where it is thickeſt, which is the Extremity, where the point of the Blade meets when it ſhuts, it has about two Inches, and ſeven or eight Lines Circumference; and on the other Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſomewhat leſs than two Inches; and thus one ſhall have folding-Saws, which may be carry'd in the Pocket as eaſily as the <hi>Pruning-Knives,</hi> the Blade cloſing into the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which will be very Convenient, and very Neceſſary for a <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do think it a very great matter to have good Tools, but that is not enough, there is ſome Skill requir'd to uſe them well, either for the expedition of Buſineſs, or to avoid ſome Accidents. This is a Prentiſhip which generally coſts ſome blood to thoſe who begin to work, without having had good Directions. There are ſome neceſſary Precautions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the manner of placing the whole Body well, and particularly of placing the left hand well, without which, a Learner is in great danger of hurting himſelf; therefore I think it very proper to Inſtruct him in it at firſt.</p>
                        <p>To that end, I ſay, firſt, that the Perſon muſt be diſpos'd and planted near his <hi>Tree,</hi> in ſuch a manner as to ſtand firm, ſo as to be able with eaſe to make uſe of his Inſtruments with his full Strength and Vigour: In the ſecond place, he muſt hold his Tools as firm as can be, that they may not turn in his hand: And, in the third place, as to his <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> he muſt always begin his <hi>Pruning,</hi> that is, to Cut, on that ſide which is oppoſite to the Eye, or the <hi>Branch</hi> upon which he cuts, which muſt after that make the extremity of the <hi>Branch</hi> which is cut: And in fine, whether he cuts to the Right, which is towards home, and is the moſt common; or whether he cuts with a back hand, as it is often neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and proper to be done, he muſt ſtill take care, and uſe the precaution of putting his left hand underneath, and cloſe to the place which is to be cut, there to remain as it were fix'd, and to hold the part he graſps ſo ſteady that it may not ſtir or move in the leaſt; and ſo conſequently reſiſt the force of the Right hand in cutting; otherwiſe if the left hand ſhould quit its hold, the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> would no doubt meet with it, and wound it dangerouſly.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this, that Right hand muſt be us'd, not only to hold the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> ſo, that the edge may be mov'd Flat-wiſe, and <hi>Horizontally,</hi> but alſo uſe it to ſtop ſhort after the effort it has exerted in cutting, that you may cut nothing but the <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Root</hi> that you intend to Cut, without touching any of the Neighbouring ones, which muſt ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be preſerv'd, as neither to be any wiſe Cut, or Wounded; and therefore before you come to preſent the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> you muſt rightly obſerve the Situation of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Branches,</hi> and partly conſider, not only how the hand muſt go in Cutting, for that hand in moving muſt give a certain turn to the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> that the Point may meet with nothing; but you muſt likewiſe feel how far the force you muſt uſe to carry off at once the part you deſign to remove may carry you, leſt the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> in its way might harm ſome of the Neighbouring <hi>Branches;</hi> and this we call <hi>Cutting Dry,</hi> as it muſt be done to <hi>Prune</hi> well, that is to Cut cleverly; ſo that if it be a <hi>Branch,</hi> the Cut may be in ſome manner round, and flat; at leaſt it muſt in no wiſe be long, as Unskilful People do it; and if it happen to be made long-wiſe, you muſt make uſe of your <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> again, to take away that Deformity; noting however, that it muſt be done in a different manner from <hi>Roots,</hi> which muſt be cut abſolutely like the Foot of a Hind, that is ſomewhat long-wiſe: We have given a Reaſon for it in the Chapter of <hi>Plantations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When by a frequent Exerciſe, or habit of <hi>Pruning,</hi> a Man is become handy, and bold in Cutting, he may very well, eſpecially in the Caſe of certain green <hi>Branches,</hi> thick enough to be taken away, I ſay he may very well place his left hand above the right, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48210:138"/>
graſp, and gently bend ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> in drawing them towards him; and by that means, ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> will really prove more eaſie to be Cut; in ſo much that a Man will often be ſurpriz'd to find ſo great a <hi>Branch</hi> ſo eaſily cut off at one ſtroak; but then this Left Hand muſt be at ſuch a diſtance from the Right, that the great ſtrength he muſt uſe to cut at once the <hi>Branch</hi> in queſtion, may not carry it as far as that Left Hand; and it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that as in Cutting, the Right hand moves towards the Left, ſo that likewiſe ſhould move away from it, in carrying off, as I may call it, the Booty which the Right Hand has newly prepar'd for it; or otherwiſe, as we have already ſaid, that Left Hand wou'd run a great hazard of receiving a dangerous wound, which happens but too often.</p>
                        <p>Let us ſay moreover, that in order to Cut well, every <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be within reach of him that Cuts it; in ſo much that he may be able to Cut it without ſtraining himſelf; that is, that ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhou'd reach up to the ſtomach of the <hi>Gard'ner:</hi> If it be much lower, he muſt be forc'd to ſtoop ſo as to put one knee to the ground, if it be needful; and if that <hi>Branch</hi> be too high, he muſt get upon ſomething, either a Ladder, or Steps, to the end that he may Cut it with eaſe, and without ſtraining himſelf; for he would run a great bazard of hurting himſelf, or of ſplitting the <hi>Branch</hi> in cutting it downwards: It is not ſo dangerous to cut upwards; provided, as I have ſaid, the Left Hand be below the Right.</p>
                        <p>I may ſay by the by, that <hi>Vine-Leaves</hi> are a Natural Balm to ſtop the Blood of the Wounds a Man receives in <hi>Pruning,</hi> they take away the Pain, and cloſe up the Wound in a very little time. The tendereſt <hi>Leaves</hi> are commonly the beſt, and for want of green <hi>Leaves,</hi> the old ones may ſerve: I have formerly Experienc'd that Remedy, and often upon my ſelf; and have always found ſo much benefit by it, that I willingly adviſe our New <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s to uſe it upon occaſion.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Saw,</hi> thoſe that are to uſe it, muſt, contrary to what is done with the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Knife,</hi> as much as poſſibly can be, place the Left Hand above the Right, and lean hard upon the part which is to be Saw'd, to hinder it from ſtirring; otherwiſe the <hi>Saw</hi> would not play well. That done, they muſt hold the handle of the <hi>Saw</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the But-end may not reach above the middle of the Palm of the Hand, and juſt underneath the Thumb, where it muſt in ſome manner be ſtay'd, or ſupported, to move the <hi>Saw</hi> the better; in order to which, it is likewiſe proper that the Fore-Finger ſhould be ſtretch'd along the Handle, as far as the edge of the Blade, to conduct the motion of the <hi>Saw</hi> the ſtreighter; and to that end, is requir'd, in the firſt place, a conſiderable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Mind to what is to be Saw'd, without the leaſt diſtraction by any thing; and at the ſame time, the <hi>Saw</hi> muſt be manag'd with an extream quickneſs and Vigour; for working ſlowly, or thinking upon any thing elſe, the Work wou'd not ſucceed well, and the <hi>Saw</hi> would often bend, or break: You muſt not Saw quite through, but ſtop juſt cloſe to the laſt Bark, otherwiſe you might be in danger of tearing the Bark from off the remaining <hi>Branch,</hi> and conſequently peel it dangerouſly; ſo that the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> muſt always end the work of the <hi>Saw,</hi> both to cut off clean what has not been made an end of Sawing, and to ſmooth the part that has been Saw'd; that is, to cut off all that remains rough from the Action of Sawing, ſince otherwiſe it would hardly recover, the <hi>Saw</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſome manner burnt the part ſo Saw'd.</p>
                        <p>There are likewiſe certain Occaſions, in which the Left Hand, by gently bending the <hi>Branch</hi> to be Saw'd, makes the Saw play the better; and ſooner, and more neatly finiſhes the Work: But you muſt be very exact in the ſtrength you uſe, or apply in bending, leſt you ſhould make a dangerous Slit in the part that is to remain. This is what I had to ſay, as to our Tools; let us now proceed to the application of the uſe that is to be made of them.</p>

                           <p>Of the firſt Pruning of a <hi>Tree</hi> that has not Sprouted at all the firſt Year.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS to the firſt Caſe, in which we ſuppoſe the <hi>Tree</hi> to have ſhot forth nothing the firſt Year, perhaps it may be dead, and appears viſibly ſo; and perhaps it is really dead, tho' it does not ſeem to be ſo, by reaſon of a little Green which the <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> diſcovers under the Bark; for without doubt it may ſeem alive at the Head, and yet be dead at the <hi>Root,</hi> and that is likewiſe call'd being quite dead, without however appearing ſo outwardly; or elſe it may ſeem dead, either becauſe it has produc'd nothing, or perhaps becauſe part of the <hi>Stem</hi> is really dead, tho' it be no wiſe dead in the Principal Place, which is the Place of the Principle of Life, and of the thick <hi>Roots,</hi> on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the whole Spring of <hi>Vegetation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Tree</hi> is dead on all ſides, it is eaſily known by the dryneſs, or blackneſs either of the whole <hi>Stem,</hi> or a main part of it; eſpecially if that blackneſs appears about the <hi>Graff;</hi> in which Caſe it is neither difficult of giving, nor of receiving good Advice; that is, ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> muſt be remov'd as ſoon as you are convinc'd of its being Dead, but ever with an intention of putting another in the room of it, at the firſt moderate Shower of Rain: Provided the death of ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> be perceiv'd in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 'till which time you may plant others in the room of it; but it is not ſo ſafe to be done during the reſt of the Summer.</p>
                        <p>This Re-implacement ſufficiently ſhews, that I deſign it ſhould be done by means of thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> which are brought up in Baskets; if, as I have ſo much exhorted People to do, the Curious have taken care to raiſe ſome in that manner, not only in the firſt year of their Planting, but likewiſe all the following years; to the end that this firſt year, and even at all times they may have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing their <hi>Garden</hi> perfectly Stock'd: Without doubt ſuch Basket <hi>Trees</hi> in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> would have ſhot their <hi>Roots</hi> beyond the Baskets, in caſe they had taken ſo well, as to produce very fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> which are the only ones you muſt re-implace, but it is very dangerous to take them out, to Tranſport or Plant them in the Summer, when their <hi>Roots</hi> are thus ſhot out; for they either break in removing, or as their Extremities are <hi>White,</hi> they eaſily blacken in a hot Air, and conſequently periſh; and cauſe the <hi>Tree</hi> to pine long, and even often kills it.</p>
                        <p>But if you do not uſe Baskets in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> you muſt ſtay until the return of the next Seaſon of Planting, which is from <hi>November,</hi> to the middle of <hi>March,</hi> and then they may be us'd; or having none, you muſt Re-plant a new <hi>Tree</hi> well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd, in the Room of that which is dead.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time we muſt carefully examine how we happen'd to be deceiv'd in that <hi>Tree,</hi> in which we had obſerv'd all the appearances of a better fortune; ſince without that it ſhould not have been <hi>Planted,</hi> to the end that if it be poſſible to diſcover or avoid the Inconveniencies that have kill'd it, we may endeavour to remedy it for the future.</p>
                        <p>For Example, it may be the great Cold during the Winter, which happens but ſeldom, <note place="margin">Funduſque mendax Arbore nunc aquas cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pante, nunc tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente agros Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera. <hi>Horatius</hi>
                           </note> or elſe the great Heat during the Summer, which may happen: Then ſince great Colds, and great Heats are capable of ſpoiling and ruining the <hi>Roots</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> the beſt way to prevent it is, to cover the Foot of that which is newly Planted with ſomething, for it is an ill Expedient to Plant it deeper than I have ſaid in the Treatiſe of <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> pretending thereby to preſerve the <hi>Roots</hi> from the Cold or Heat: It is better then to Plant it according to our Rules, and take care in the Summer to cover the Foot with Fearn, or dry Dung, or elſe new drawn Weeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Tree</hi> be dead only for want of watering, the new one muſt be water'd; if for <note place="margin">Nec ſen'ire ſitim patitur, bibulaeque recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas radicis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras labentibus i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>If, in fine, ſome <hi>Moles</hi> have rais'd and ſhaken them, you muſt endeavour to catch them; if the <hi>Worms</hi> have gnaw'd them, they muſt be look'd for, and deſtroy'd; tho' as we have already ſaid elſewhere, it be of all the Evils that may afflict <hi>Plantations</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt dangerous, and moſt incurable: All the Comfort that can be had in this is, That it is a kind of Torrent that muſt of neceſſity have its Courſe, but paſſes, and does not return often; and this is what I have to ſay as to a <hi>Tree</hi> which is, and actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears dead the firſt year of its being Planted.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Tree</hi> remain green in the whole <hi>Stem,</hi> or at leaſt in a great part of it, without having produc'd any thing, and that perhaps it be only a kind of <hi>Lethargy,</hi> which has in ſome meaſure benum'd the <hi>Vegetative Faculty,</hi> as it happens to ſome <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> newly Planted, which remain ſometimes two, three, or four years without coming to any thing, and yet at laſt perform Wonders. 'Tis ſtrange and difficult to apprehend, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life of thoſe kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> which in effect are ſo eaſie to take, and yet are ſo hard to dye, ſhou'd not withſtanding be ſo difficult to be mov'd to begin ſome <hi>Roots:</hi> But this is not the Point in queſtion here; our <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> are not ſo long without ſhewing the certainty of their Life or Death.</p>
                        <p>In caſe, I ſay, this <hi>Fruit-Tree</hi> has preſerv'd its greenneſs all the Summer, without producing any <hi>Shoots;</hi> it may perhaps give ſome hope of ſatisfaction for the time to come, but indeed that hope is very ſlight; and if it may be done conveniently, the ſureſt way is to replant as ſoon as can be another new one, that appears better, or at leaſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good in the room of it; but if no other can be had, I am ſtill of Opinion that it will be proper in the Month of <hi>November</hi> to ſearch round about that ſuſpicious <hi>Foot,</hi> to ſee whether there appears any good beginning of thick <hi>Roots,</hi> or none at all.</p>
                        <p>In the Firſt Caſe, that is, if any good Signs be diſcover'd, conſiſting in the beginning or growing of ſome thick <hi>Roots,</hi> which is very extraordinary; for as ſoon as any new <hi>Roots</hi> grow in Summer, new <hi>Shoots</hi> appear at the ſame time: If then, I ſay, any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thick <hi>Roots</hi> be diſcover'd, which perhaps only began to form themſelves ſince the end of Summer, you muſt reſt there, without doing any thing more, and only cover the Place well again where you have open'd the Ground; and beſides, the following Summer take ſome extraordinary Carefrom time to time to Water it, if the Ground and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeem to requireit: Such a <hi>Tree</hi> may very well make up the time it has loſt, and become fine the following years.</p>
                        <p>In the Second Caſe, that is when the <hi>Tree</hi> has perform'd nothing by its <hi>Root,</hi> it muſt be wholly taken out of the Ground, and <hi>Prun'd</hi> again, that is, according to the Term of a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> all its <hi>Roots</hi> muſt be refreſh'd, doing the ſame to the Head, of which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity may perhaps be dead; and in ſuch a Caſe it muſt be refreſh'd as far as the quick, and then the <hi>Tree</hi> may be re-planted at that very time, and in the ſame place, if it be judg'd worth it, having preſerv'd its <hi>Roots</hi> ſound and entire, or you muſt fling it quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if the principal <hi>Roots</hi> be defective, either in being dry, or black, or being actually rotten, or gnaw'd, as it happens ſometimes, for in that Caſe no good can be expected from them: The Caſe is different, when there are only ſome ſmall <hi>Roots</hi> tainted, tho' it be not a good Sign: but however, in that Caſe it wou'd be ſufficient to Cut them again to the quick, and Re-plant the <hi>Tree</hi> in the ſame place where it has given Cauſe to believe its Deſtiny doubtful: I have pretty often Re-planted ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> where they have thriven ſo well, that ſome years after I have ſucceſsfully given them ſome of the Chief Places of the <hi>Garden,</hi> and yet I had Planted very good new <hi>Trees</hi> in the Places where thoſe could not thrive: It is very difficult to have perfect <hi>Plantations</hi> without all thoſe neceſſary Conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>The Coolneſs of a moiſt <hi>Ground</hi> is ſometimes ſufficient to preſerve for a year, or more, uncertain ſigns of Life, both in the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Stem</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> as well as it preſerves it in Cut <hi>Branches,</hi> and yet without any certainty of their performing afterwards any happy <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> that is, to <hi>Operate</hi> in the ſame manner as well qualify'd <hi>Trees</hi> uſe to do; therefore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48210:140"/>
it is fit to be very nice upon thoſe kind of appearances of Life, by which ſo many People ſuffer themſelves to be amuz'd and deceiv'd for ſo many Years. This is, what I had to ſay upon thoſe appearances of Life, whether Good and Certain, or Ill and Doubtful.</p>

                        <p>Upon which I declare, that I have but little more value for that <hi>Tree,</hi> than for the Preceeding, which we have juſt examin'd, and found it either quite Dead, as well in the <hi>Roots,</hi> as in the <hi>Stem,</hi> or only dead as to the <hi>Roots,</hi> tho' it appear'd green at the Bark; or elſe have found it to have yet ſome ſmall ſigns of Life in the <hi>Roots,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Stem;</hi> both theſe, and the others, having ſtill preſerv'd ſome ſigns of Life; that is, ſome green, and a little <hi>Sap.</hi> Therefore when I am furniſh'd with good <hi>Trees,</hi> I never fail reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, altho' it has ſprouted a little, as well as the preceeding which has not ſprouted at all: But when I find my ſelf in want, or unprovided, I am contented with cutting theſe little <hi>Shoots</hi> cloſe to the <hi>Stem,</hi> ſhortning that above by the half; and beſides, I never fail to ſearch the Foot; and if I find that the <hi>Roots</hi> have <hi>Shot</hi> nothing, as it happens ſometime, I pluck up the <hi>Tree</hi> quite, and refreſh the <hi>Roots,</hi> to ſee if they are all ſound; which being ſo, I plant them again, or elſe ſome of the Principals being ſpoil'd, I fling it away.</p>
                        <p>If in order to Replant ſuch a <hi>Tree,</hi> I fear the <hi>Earth</hi> be not good enough, I put better in the room of it, this is the only good expedient to be us'd; the help of <hi>Dung</hi> being too uncertain and deceitful to rely upon it: In fine, I do the ſame thing to this <hi>Tree,</hi> as I do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that, which did nothing, but remain'd Green both at the Head and <hi>Roots,</hi> which we <hi>Prun'd</hi> anew every where, and afterwards Replanted, either in the <hi>Garden,</hi> or in the <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery;</hi> or elſe like the other, whoſe Head is really in a pretty good Condition, that is Green, but yet has its principal <hi>Roots</hi> entirely ſpoil'd, which, upon that account, we have rejected as dead therefore I ev'n look for a new <hi>Tree,</hi> to put in the room of that, which, as it were, only ſeem'd to Sprout, ſuch little <hi>Shoots</hi> being properly but falſe marks of its having taken new <hi>Root,</hi> they being only produc'd by the effect of <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the <hi>Roots,</hi> as I explain elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>That pitiful <hi>Fruit-Bud,</hi> which appears upon the languiſhing Head of that <hi>Tree</hi> newly Planted, far from producing in me the effect it operates upon ſo many <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> that is, from raiſing any Joy in me, or giving me the leaſt Conſideration, either for the Father that has brought it to light, or for the Action by which it is produc'd, creates in me on the contrary, a real ſcorn for both; which confirming me in the Maxims I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, to prove that <hi>Fruits</hi> are only marks of weakneſs, puts me upon the reſolution of forſaking that <hi>Tree,</hi> and to fling it away like a piece of dead or uſeleſs <hi>Wood:</hi> This I do not only to low <hi>Trees,</hi> that are to make <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or part of the <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>Standards,</hi> both the one and the other being a-like, in reſpect to their taking new <hi>Root.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will ſay here by the by, that this deſpicable <hi>Bud,</hi> which I think I may call a <hi>Bud</hi> of Poverty, has rais'd a War between ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and I, becauſe I will not grant them, that the <hi>Production</hi> of it is a ſign of Vigour in the <hi>Tree,</hi> as commonly the Generation of Animals, is a mark of it in the Fathers.</p>
                        <p>I explain this matter more at large in my Reflections, not having thought it proper to proceed any further here upon the Reaſonings I have had cauſe to make upon it, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to a thouſand irreproachable Experiences.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> that has at leaſt produc'd one fine <hi>Branch.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE muſt now proceed to the Third Article, which relates to our low <hi>Trees,</hi> newly Planted, either for a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> and declare what we are to do if they Sprout reaſonably; that is, at leaſt one Beautiful, and ſufficiently thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which is commonly attended with ſome weak ones.</p>
                        <p>In that caſe, we are to make <hi>Three</hi> particular Conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether that fine <hi>Branch</hi> proceeds from the extremity of the <hi>Stem,</hi> the middle, or the lower part.</p>
                        <p>If altogether from the extremity, out of the fear of falling into the inconvenience I dread, which is a defect for a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> that is, its growing too high in the <hi>Stem,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which inconvenience I ſhould undoubtedly fall; if I perform'd my <hi>Pruning</hi> upon that new <hi>Shoot,</hi> I rather reſolve to ſhorten the <hi>Stem</hi> of that young <hi>Tree</hi> about an Inch or two, and ſo put it back to the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> Being certain, that round the extremity where I ſhall lower it, it will produce fine new <hi>Branches,</hi> all well plac'd, and in a ſufficient Number; and this is grounded upon that fine <hi>Shoot</hi> it has produc'd, which convinces me fully, that it has ſhot forth good <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus in putting back perhaps the Pleaſure of a Year, becauſe I run the hazard of having my <hi>Fruit</hi> ſomewhat later; I avoid the diſſatisfaction of having a <hi>Tree</hi> riſe too high, as it would do, if I permitted it wholly to <hi>Shoot</hi> out of that <hi>Branch,</hi> which would offend me perpetually, whereas in taking it a little lower, I put it in a way of appearing with all the advantage that can be deſir'd in a well order'd <hi>Tree;</hi> and conſequently I put it in a condition of rewarding me yet better, as well by a fine Figure, as by the pleaſure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the fine <hi>Branch</hi> ſhoot out of the middle of the <hi>Stem,</hi> you muſt without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cut down the <hi>Stem</hi> to that <hi>Branch,</hi> and even ſhorten that <hi>Branch</hi> within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of four or five Eyes at moſt, therein to place the whole foundation, and all the hope of a Beautiful figure in your <hi>Tree;</hi> it being certain, that at the place where you have ſhorten'd it, it will produce in the ſecond Year at leaſt two fine <hi>Branches,</hi> oppoſite to each other: This is ſufficient to make a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> for thoſe who know how to order it well; but if that ſhorten'd <hi>Branch</hi> ſhoots forth three or four, as it happens pretty often, the ſucceſs will ſtill be the more favourable, eaſie, and agreeable.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe ſtill, that the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> who are any thing careful, will have taken care to order that only <hi>Branch</hi> we ſpeak of, in ſuch a manner, that it may be very upright, in order to form a ſtreight <hi>Tree</hi> upon its Center, as it is neceſſary it ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>If they have been wanting as to that Precaution, they muſt have recourſe to the grand Remedy, which is, to ſhorten that <hi>Branch</hi> within the compaſs of two or three Eyes, which rough Treatment had not been neceſſary, had it been well rear'd up from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Pruning</hi> that <hi>Branch,</hi> which is come here by its ſelf, one may ſtill preſerve, not the very ſmall <hi>Branches</hi> which I call <hi>Sappleſs,</hi> and muſt be utterly exterminated from our new planted <hi>Tree;</hi> but only ſome of thoſe that are either ſhort, or paſſably thick, or longiſh, and likewiſe paſſably thick, in whatever place either of them may be; provided they have pretty good <hi>Eyes,</hi> and are well plac'd, we may ſecurely expect to have ſoon <hi>Fruit</hi> upon them, without fearing it might prejudice the vigour of our <hi>Tree,</hi> eſpecially in ſtone <hi>Fruit,</hi> and even in Kernel <hi>Fruit,</hi> taking care however to ſhorten thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> a little, which are really too long, without medling with the others that are ſhort and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably thick.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon why I do not hinder the preſerving of ſome of thoſe weak <hi>Branches,</hi> is, that being very certain, as I have ſo often repeated, that it is the ſmall quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> which produces the <hi>Fruit,</hi> it follows from thence, that the little <hi>Sap</hi> that goes towards the making of it, cannot conſiderably prejudice our new <hi>Tree,</hi> and yet it will afford us a great deal of Pleaſure in giving us <hi>Fruit</hi> betimes.</p>
                        <p>It is not that I think it a great fault, the firſt Year, unmercifully to take away all thoſe hopes of the <hi>Firſt Fruits:</hi> The Curious may do in this as they think fit, but for my part, I preſerve them.</p>
                        <p>If our only <hi>Branch</hi> ſhoots out of the lower part of the <hi>Stem,</hi> we have Reaſon to rejoice at it, it is very well plac'd, provided the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> has taken care of it betimes, to keep
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48210:142"/>
it upright, in caſe it were not ſo, as we have ſaid of the Preceeding: We may with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>Prune</hi> it the heighth we deſire it at, to begin a Fine <hi>Tree,</hi> whether it be a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Tree;</hi> but if it prove not ſtreight, or without a probability of being ſtreightned by ſome ſtrong Ligature, it muſt be us'd like the other, that is, it muſt be ſhorten'd quite low to make it produce another that may be ſtreight, otherwiſe the <hi>Tree</hi> would always be a-wry, and conſequently of an ill Figure, ſtill remembring that the <hi>Stem</hi> muſt be ſhorten'd cloſe to the ſingle <hi>Branch</hi> it has produc'd, and we have <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will ſay here, by the by, that when we Plant a <hi>Tree,</hi> we may according to appearances, but not demonſtratively and infallibly aſſure that it will take <hi>Root:</hi> Yet leſs, in caſe it do's, can we aſſign in what part it will produce its firſt <hi>Shoot:</hi> But as for the Fine <hi>Branches</hi> produc'd by a <hi>Tree</hi> that has taken <hi>Root,</hi> which we have afterwards <hi>Prun'd,</hi> we may with ſome certainty affirm, that they will produce New ones on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities on them which we have ſhorten'd, and partly gueſs at the quantity; ſo that this may be rely'd upon; and conſequently if our <hi>Tree</hi> has only produc'd the ſingle <hi>Branch</hi> we ſpeak of, we may with certainty expect that being <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſomewhat ſhort, it will at leaſt ſhoot two fine ones, capable of performing in all reſpects what we have above eſtabliſh'd for the beginning of the Beautiful Figure of a <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I fancy then, that as to this <hi>Branch</hi> ſhot from the lower part of our <hi>Stem,</hi> we may partly allow it the ſame length we had allow'd that <hi>Stem</hi> in Planting the <hi>Tree,</hi> that is, about ſeven or eight Inches long, what ever place we have Planted it in, whether in Cold, or Moiſt Ground, or Hot, and Dry.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS to the Fourth Caſe, in which our new Planted <hi>Tree</hi> has produc'd two Fine <hi>Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> or three, or four, or more, with ſome weak ones among them.</p>
                        <p>We are to make other great Conſiderations upon them, which will engage us into different Chapters, <hi>Viz.</hi> In the firſt place, to know whether that Plurality of <hi>Branches</hi> be produc'd to ones liking; That is, whether they grow round about ſome part of the <hi>Stem,</hi> whether at the top, in the middle, or in the lower part; ſo that they may grow like a <hi>Branch-Candleſtick,</hi> for a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or like a Hand ſpread open for a <hi>Wall-Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To know, in the ſecond place, whether all thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> are grown on one ſide, and all over one another.</p>
                        <p>Or whether in Degrees at a great diſtance from each other, tho' round about the <hi>Stem,</hi> or if ſometimes they are all grown from one and the ſame <hi>Eye,</hi> and likewiſe whether it be on the top, middle, or lower part of the <hi>Stem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, to know whether all thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> of themſelves are diſpos'd to open and ſpread, or all of them to keep cloſe together in a confus'd manner.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are almoſt all the different ways in which the firſt ſhort <hi>Shoots</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> newly Planted form themſelves, when it is ſo happy as to take <hi>Root</hi> again, as it appears by the Figures hereunto annex'd.</p>
                        <p>I repeat again, that I do not Conſider here, as any thing Conſiderable, the little ſmall <hi>Branches,</hi> altho' they ſhould be good to produce <hi>Fruit</hi> the very next year, which is often true in Stone <hi>Fruit,</hi> but ſeldom in Kernel <hi>Fruit:</hi> Woe to that <hi>Tree,</hi> what ever it be, which produces many of theſe, or no others; however, I will ſay what is fit to be done to them, after having ended the moſt material part of my Work.</p>
                        <p>They are only the great <hi>Branches</hi> I value in this Caſe, deſiring to have a fine and good <hi>Tree;</hi> theſe, in reſpect to this, have been the firſt Object of my Wiſhes, and the only ones that can ſerve for the firſt foundation of my <hi>Tree,</hi> that is, in caſe they be Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well plac'd, and I can give them a <hi>Pruning</hi> proper for my Intention, and for the Beauty of the <hi>Tree</hi> I am to manage.</p>
                        <p>For as the firſt <hi>Branches,</hi> tho' happy in their Original, may very well be ill order'd, and conſequently give an ill beginning to a <hi>Tree,</hi> being handled by an Unskilful Hand; ſo likewiſe tho' thoſe firrſt <hi>Branches,</hi> at their firſt Sprouting, might happen to be found in a defective Situation, may very well with a little time, and good diſcipline be, as I have ſaid, ſo Skilfully turn'd, that the defect of their Birth may not hinder them from being Mothers to a Well-ſhap'd, and Sightly <hi>Tree.</hi>

The firſt Caution I am to give here, is, that commonly all the thick <hi>Branches</hi> which grow the firſt year upon new <hi>Trees,</hi> are thoſe we call <hi>Branches</hi> of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> their <hi>Eyes</hi> diſcover it; and therefore muſt be Treated accordingly by <hi>Pruning,</hi> and even the weak and ſlender ones are commonly in that reſpect of the ſame Form with the thick ones, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did remain very ſhort.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Advertiſement, is, that the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> I perform upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of New <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> differs but little from that I uſe the firſt year upon New <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> It is true, that in theſe I eaſily conſtrain the moſt obſtinate <hi>Branches,</hi> that is the worſt grown, to put themſelves into the Poſture I deſire, to attain the Beauty requir'd in a <hi>Wali-Tree;</hi> it ſerves likewiſe to afford me more <hi>Fruit,</hi> and finer; it is likewiſe true, that <hi>Dwarfs</hi> are, if that Expreſſion may be us'd, a kind of half Volunteers, which indeed do part of what they have a mind to themſelves; but yet commonly ſuffer themſelves at the ſame time, to be conducted by my Induſtry, as well for the ſatisfaction of my Eyes, as for the delight of my Pallate: Only the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> can not be left ſo long upon <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> as upon <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> becauſe in thoſe we have the Convenience of <hi>Tacking</hi> and <hi>Propping,</hi> which we have not in others.</p>

                           <p>Of the Firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> that has produc'd two Fine <hi>Branches,</hi> and both well Plac'd.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS for what relates then to this Fourth Caſe, in which a <hi>Tree</hi> newly Planted has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and vigorouſly produc'd more than one Fine <hi>Branch,</hi> with ſome weak ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: If, for inſtance, it has on the top of the <hi>Stem</hi> two almoſt equally ſtrong, and well plac'd, that is one on one ſide, and another on the other, nothing can hardly be deſir'd better, it is a very fair beginning to make a Fine <hi>Tree:</hi> The only thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, to ſhorten them all equally within the compaſs of five or ſix Inches in length: But above all, you muſt take care that the two laſt <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Extremity of each of theſe <hi>Branches</hi> ſo ſhorten'd, look on the Right, and on the Left, upon the two bare ſides, to the end, that each of them producing at leaſt two new ones, theſe four may be ſo well plac'd, that they may be all preſerv'd; and in order to that, if it be a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> they muſt all contribute to form the thin Round which we deſire; and if it be a <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> to form the flat and full Round, which we likewiſe deſign.</p>
                        <p>It would be ill <hi>Pruning,</hi> if thoſe two laſt <hi>Eyes</hi> look'd, for Example, either on the inſide of the <hi>Dwarf</hi> to begin to fill it, or the outſide to begin to open too much; it being firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd well to eſtabliſh the firſt Beauty of the Figure of that <hi>Tree,</hi> which is to open in a Round equally garniſh'd: For the ſame Reaſon, in relation to the <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Pruning</hi> would not be ſufficiently well perform'd, unleſs it were order'd ſo, that the two <hi>Eyes</hi> that are to be found on the Extremities of the two <hi>Branches</hi> that are to be ſhorten'd, ſhould caſt upon oppoſite ſides the New <hi>Branches</hi> they are able to produce: for it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that thoſe very <hi>Branches</hi> ſhould have of themſelves, and without the leaſt violence a Natural diſpoſition to place themſelves well upon thoſe parts of the Wall that we would cover, to the end that they may all be preſerv'd; and ſo the firſt Vigorous <hi>Branches</hi> of that <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> have perform'd their duty, as well as the firſt Vigorous ones of the firſt <hi>Dwarf</hi> will have done theirs: However, it will ſtill be fitting to have ſuch neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards both towards the one and the other, as may tend firſt, and chiefly, to a Roundneſs, which muſt be continu'd to that end, until the Round be almoſt perfect, and then we muſt begin to have two other Proſpects to dwell upon; of which, the one is, to endeavour by all poſſible means to give a reaſonable opening to that <hi>Tree,</hi> if it be a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attain'd its roundneſs; and to fill it equally throughout its whole extent, if it be a <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> likewiſe having its roundneſs; The other Proſpect is, to preſerve in both that Round which is already form'd, and muſt yearly grow in Circumference, without ever, as much as in us lies, ſuffering it to loſe any thing of the Beauty of its Figure.</p>
                        <p>A particular Care muſt be taken, that if one of thoſe two <hi>Branches</hi> has any advantage in thickneſs over the other, ſo that likely the one may well produce two other thick ones, while his Neighbour can yield but one; in ſuch a Caſe, I ſay, care muſt be taken, that as well the two of the thickeſt, as the ſingle one of that which is not ſo thick, may come forth ſo happily, that all three together may be preſerv'd as fit and neceſſary for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Beautiful Figure in queſtion: Otherwiſe, if there ſhould be a neceſſity of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48210:144"/>

                           <p>Of the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> that has only produc'd two <hi>Branches,</hi> both beautiful and thick, yet both ill-plac'd.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IF one of thoſe firſt fine <hi>Branches</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> has produc'd, be conſiderably lower than the other, or perhaps both on the ſame ſide; or may be the one on one ſide on the top of the Extremity, and the other quite at the bottom of the oppoſite ſide; in that Caſe, I ſay, you muſt fiercely and unmercifully reſolve to preſerve but one, and chuſe the fitteſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a fine Figure; and conſequently, you muſt cut off the other ſo cloſe, that, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it may never be able to produce any thick ones in the ſame place; it being moſt certain, that if both were preſerv'd, it cou'd never form a <hi>Tree</hi> of an agreeable Figure, the ſight of which wou'd continually vex you, for not having order'd it well from its Infancy. The Ignorant perhaps may imagine, that this wou'd occaſion the loſs of a Year; but I can aſſure them of the contrary, if they will confide in me. In this Caſe then you muſt take down the <hi>Tree</hi> to the loweſt <hi>branch,</hi> if you deſign to preſerve that, which, indeed, is the moſt proper for our Deſign, and an infallible Means not to fear any other <hi>Branch</hi> ill-plac'd on that ſide: Or, if you muſt take off the loweſt, as not being fit to contribute to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> it muſt be cut within the thickneſs of a Crown-piece; for there ſeldom ariſes a neceſſity of cutting a thick new <hi>Branch,</hi> being ill-plac'd ſo cloſe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all may grow from it. I explain this ſort of <hi>Pruning,</hi> together with that which is to be perform'd ſloping, more at large in the 21. Chapter.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Pruning</hi> within the thickneſs of a Crown-piece, will either produce nothing, or only weak <hi>Branches,</hi> which, far from ſpoiling any thing, will be fit to be preſerv'd for <hi>Fruit.</hi> This way of <hi>Pruning</hi> ſuppoſes the <hi>Branch</hi> to be thick and vigorous; for had it been a moderate one, it muſt have been preſerv'd entire, as a <hi>Fruit-Branch;</hi> if very thin, it muſt have been cut ſo cloſe to the <hi>Stem,</hi> that no paſſage had remain'd for any thing new; and that particularly, it being very ill-plac'd, or the <hi>Tree</hi> having but a moderate Vigour.</p>
                        <p>This Caſe of a ſingle <hi>Branch,</hi> which has been preſerv'd, and muſt be <hi>prun'd,</hi> reduces it ſelf to another heretofore explain'd, where our <hi>Tree</hi> at firſt produc'd but one fine <hi>Branch;</hi> and conſequently, in order to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of this, you muſt follow the Method preſcrib'd for the other, which is uſeleſs to repeat here.</p>
                        <p>It happens ſometimes, that from one and the ſame <hi>Eye</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> newly planted, two fair <hi>Branches</hi> may proceed, without any others from any other part. In ſuch a Caſe, they may both be preſerv'd very well, whatever part of the <hi>Stem</hi> they are in; that is, if they are likely to ſerve to form a beautiful Figure, as it is poſſible, if the Vigour of the <hi>Foot,</hi> or the Care of the <hi>Gardner,</hi> have made them ſhoot ſtreight upwards: But if either of them cannot ſerve towards that Figure, it will be neceſſary to take it away, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that, of which a good uſe may be made; and that muſt be order'd according to the foregoing Method upon that Subject.</p>

                        <p>In the firſt of theſe Caſes, we ſuppoſe that the three or four <hi>Branches</hi> are grown on the Extremity of the <hi>Stem,</hi> and in a proper place to form at firſt a fine <hi>Tree:</hi> In that Caſe, I ſay, they muſt, for the firſt time, be <hi>prun'd</hi> with all the ſame Regards we have explain'd

for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the two firſt which were by themſelves, and likewiſe well plac'd. In caſe theſe three or four be partly all of an equal thickneſs, they muſt all be us'd alike: If one or two of them ſhould be ſomewhat leſs in thickneſs, but ſtill fit to be <hi>Wood-Branches,</hi> or at leaſt half <hi>Wood,</hi> and conſequently capable of contributing to the Beauty of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; in that Caſe thoſe ſhall only be <hi>prun'd,</hi> with a proſpect of getting one only new <hi>Branch</hi> from them, taking care at the ſame time to have it on that ſide which ſhall be found the moſt empty; and to that end, they muſt be ſhorten'd to an <hi>Eye</hi> that looks on that ſide; and Care muſt be likewiſe taken, that the two laſt <hi>Eyes</hi> of the others, which are ſtronger, may look towards the two oppoſite Sides, in order to begin to fill them up the more.</p>
                        <p>But if thoſe three or four fine <hi>Branches</hi> ſhoot out a little below the Extremity, 'tis but ſhortning the <hi>Stem</hi> to them, and then do what I have been ſaying, when the Branches did at firſt ſhoot out from the top of the <hi>Stem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Caſe, where we ſuppoſe that the <hi>Branches</hi> produc'd, are moſt of them ill plac'd, inſomuch that they cannot all conduce towards the forming a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot all be preſerv'd, you muſt examine whether, among the three or four, there are not at leaſt two pretty well ſituated; that is, the one on one ſide, and the other on the other, and whether the Degrees are not too diſtant to permit you to frame upon thoſe ſome Foundation for your Figure; and that being ſo, thoſe may very well ſatisfie you, cutting off the others within the thickneſs of a Crown-piece, as we have heretofore eſtabliſh'd.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN fine, our new <hi>Planted Tree</hi> may, as it happens ſometimes in good <hi>Grounds,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on fine <hi>Trees,</hi> that have been <hi>Planted</hi> with all neceſſary Regards, whether they be <hi>graffed</hi> upon <hi>Tree-Stocks,</hi> or upon <hi>Quince,</hi> I ſay, it may have produc'd to the number of five, ſix, or ſeven fine <hi>Branches,</hi> and even more. It wou'd be a good Fortune if they ſhou'd be all ſo happily plac'd, that they might be all preſerv'd, without cauſing any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as I have met with it ſometimes; by which means it is eaſie to have ſoon a fine and good <hi>Tree.</hi> But as it is a Rarety to find them all well plac'd, I am of opinion, that it will be ſufficient to preſerve three or four of thoſe, that a skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> ſhall judge, both by their ſituation and ſtrength, to be the fitteſt for the Execution of our Deſign, and ſo <hi>Prune</hi> them, as we have explain'd in ſuch a Caſe. This being ſo, he muſt wholly cut off all the others, if they happen to be higher than thoſe that are preſerv'd, eſpecially if they be thick; for if they are weak, that is, fit for <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> he will do well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them until they have perform'd what they are capable of doing.</p>
                        <p>In caſe then there be a neceſſity of taking away ſome of thoſe higheſt that are thick, they muſt either be cut off <hi>Stump-wiſe,</hi> to amuſe a little <hi>Sap</hi> in them during two or three Years, or elſe the <hi>Stem</hi> muſt be ſhorten'd to them that are preſerv'd; eſpecially, the <hi>Tree</hi> not being very vigorous. But if there happen to be ſome thick ones lower than thoſe which we preſerve for ever, it is likewiſe convenient to preſerve thoſe low ones for a while, provided they ſpoil nothing in the Figure; becauſe that for the ſpace of two or three Years, they employ a little of that <hi>Sap,</hi> the Abundance of which is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to us, both to compaſs <hi>Fruit,</hi> and to arrive at a beautiful Figure. But if ſuch low <hi>Branches</hi> can annoy us, then, as we have already ſaid, they muſt be cut within the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48210:146"/>
thickneſs of a Crown-piece, or elſe take them off cloſe, when we find but a moderate Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the Foot of the <hi>Tree.</hi>

                        <p>I ſtill forewarn, that if, among the thick ones, there chance to be a great many weak ones, you muſt be contented with two or three of thoſe that are beſt plac'd, and beſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, breaking off the Extremity of the longeſt a little, and not medling with thoſe that are naturally ſhort, and paſſably thick; and conſequently, you muſt wholly take away the others, which would only cauſe a Confuſion.</p>
                        <p>This, in my Opinion, is all that can be done for the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees;</hi> I mean, for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the firſt <hi>Branches</hi> they ſhall have produc'd, in the place where they have been newly <hi>Planted.</hi>

                        <p>THE firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of thoſe New <hi>Planted Trees</hi> being perform'd, and that upon the firſt <hi>Shoots</hi> they have produc'd the firſt Year of their being <hi>Planted,</hi> we now muſt ſhew the Succeſs it ought apparently to produce, and what Conduct is to be held the following Year for the ſecond <hi>Pruning;</hi> I mean, for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the <hi>Twigs,</hi> that ſhall ſhoot from the Extremity of thoſe that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> the Year before: And to that End, I think it will be proper to follow the ſame Order I have eſtabliſh'd for the firſt; that is, for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the firſt <hi>Shoots</hi> they had produc'd.</p>
                        <p>But before I come to that, let us conſider what is to be done to the <hi>Trees</hi> which had not ſucceeded well the firſt Year.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Fruit-Tree,</hi> which, without having produc'd any <hi>Branches</hi> the firſt Year, has been preſerve'd, in hopes that, having ſtill been green, and conſequently alive, it might do better the ſecond; I ſay, if that <hi>Tree</hi> does not begin betimes, that is, even in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> to ſhoot very vigorouſly, it is an infallible Sign, that it will never be good for any thing; and therefore, without loſing any more Time, it muſt be thrown away, and one of thoſe that ſhall have been brought up in Baskets, in order to ſupply ſuch Accidents, plac'd in the room of it.</p>
                        <p>And likewiſe, if the <hi>Tree,</hi> which having only produc'd ſmall <hi>Shoots</hi> in the firſt Year, has been preſerv'd, the <hi>Stem</hi> of it being only ſhorten'd; if that <hi>Tree,</hi> I ſay, does not, at the very Entrance of the Spring, begin to ſhoot fine new <hi>Branches,</hi> I am alſo of Opinion that it ſhou'd, without any heſitation, be us'd in the ſame manner with the fore-going, we have now been ſpeaking of: It wou'd be a kind of Miracle, if ever it ſhou'd come to a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affording any Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>But if, as it happens pretty often in the Caſe of <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> and ſometimes, but not ſo often, in the Caſe of <hi>Stone-Fruit;</hi> if, I ſay, that <hi>Tree,</hi> thus taken down lower, has ſhot fine <hi>Branches</hi> at its new Extremity, as well as that, which, having ſhot but one at the top of the <hi>Stem,</hi> has been likewiſe taken down lower than the place of that <hi>Branch;</hi> then both the one, and the other will fall in one of the Caſes heretofore explain'd for the firſt <hi>Shooting</hi> of thoſe <hi>new-planted Trees</hi> which have happily ſucceeded; and ſo we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular to add to the Conduct that is to be obſerv'd for them.</p>
                        <p>Let us now proceed to the <hi>Tree,</hi> which had only produc'd one fine <hi>Branch,</hi> be it either about the middle of the <hi>Stem,</hi> or at the bottom; ſuppoſing always, as we have ſaid, that even in that firſt Year Care ſhall have been taken, in both Caſes, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both theſe only <hi>Branches</hi> ſtreight, if they were not ſo naturally: For, if that Care has not been taken, the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> muſt have been oblig'd, as I have ſaid heretofore, not only to lower the <hi>Stem</hi> to thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> but likewiſe to ſhorten them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> of the place whence they grew; which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we muſt in this Caſe only conſider for the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> that which ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd upon the <hi>Branches</hi> which are to ſhoot from thoſe two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> of a <hi>Branch</hi> ſo extraordinarily ſhorten'd: And thus this firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> will fall in one of the Caſes of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the firſt <hi>Branches</hi> of a new-planted <hi>Tree,</hi> without any neceſſity of ſaying any thing more upon that Subject.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firſt Year had only produc'd one <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> having been <hi>Prun'd</hi> upon that <hi>Branch,</hi> never fails, as we have already ſaid, of producing others on the Extremity of that <hi>Branch;</hi> and, for Example, will, without doubt, have ſhot upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48210:146"/>
it, at leaſt, one thick one, with ſome weak ones, and perhaps two or three thick ones, which is pretty uſual, and may be more. This great Multitude does not happen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; but yet it happens ſometimes.</p>
                        <p>If unfortunately it had only produc'd one upon it, partly of the ſame thickneſs with the Mother, which may happen by ſome accident befaln to the firſt <hi>Roots,</hi> then you muſt be Poſitive either in re-cutting the New one very ſhort, leaving it only two <hi>Eyes,</hi> or in cutting it quite off, which is yet better; in hopes that the other, which we muſt call the Old one, may <hi>Shoot</hi> forth ſomething more conſiderable the following year, as it may happen: For the <hi>Tree</hi> may chance to have made better <hi>Roots</hi> the third year, than it had produc'd either the firſt, or ſecond; and conſequently, being grown more Vigorous, it may ſhoot a greater quantity of Fine <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But yet, to ſpeak the Truth in ſuch Caſes, there is no relying upon the Succeſs of ſuch a <hi>Tree,</hi> which ſhews ſo little Vigour in the beginning; and therefore it is my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and I think it very material, to have recourſe to the Magazine of <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,</hi> not to languiſh in vain hopes, at leaſt beyond the ſecond year, otherwiſe you may chance to languiſh yet longer, and always to no purpoſe, as it happens to a great many of the Curious.</p>
                        <p>And if that ſingle <hi>Branch,</hi> being well <hi>Prun'd,</hi> has perform'd its duty ſo well, as to have produc'd at leaſt two of thoſe fine ones, which we look upon as <hi>Wood-Branches,</hi> or perhaps three or four, beſides ſome of thoſe that are fit for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all theſe Caſes, nothing can be done beſides what has been ſaid for the <hi>Trees,</hi> which in the firſt year of their being <hi>Planted</hi> have produc'd the ſame quantity of <hi>Shoots,</hi> that is, ſome <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> may be preſerv'd; but among the thick ones, only ſuch as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce towards the Beauty of the Figure, cutting off all the others without any mercy, either cloſe, or within the thickneſs of a Crown-piece.</p>
                        <p>So the ſecond <hi>Pruning</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> muſt be perform'd upon the fine <hi>Branches</hi> that are ſhot from that ſingle <hi>Branch,</hi> and muſt differ in nothing from the firſt that is to be perform'd upon the fine <hi>Branches,</hi> which the firſt year have been happily produc'd from the <hi>Stem</hi> of a new <hi>Planted Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Precaution of keeping upright the ſingle <hi>Branch</hi> grown upon a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> would be good, but is not ſo abſolutely neceſſary as upon a <hi>Dwarf-Standard;</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Convenience of turning almoſt at pleaſure the <hi>Branches</hi> that ſhall proceed from that, after having <hi>Prun'd</hi> it: The only thing then, is to take care in their youth of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to the Right and Left, according as may be neceſſary for laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Beautiful Figure; and in ſo doing, it is eaſie to remedy certain defects which can hardly be remedy'd in a low <hi>Standard.</hi>

                        <p>This <hi>Pruning</hi> perform'd within the thickneſs of a Crown, often ſerves to give us the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year a ſmall <hi>Branch</hi> or two, which proceed from the ſides of that thickneſs, and are commonly very good for <hi>Fruit;</hi> it happens likewiſe then, that as the <hi>Sap</hi> finds it ſelf ſtopt thus at the Overture of the <hi>Branch</hi> in queſtion, and as it muſt of neceſſity move forwards, it not being able to return back, being puſh'd and preſs'd by ſome other that follows it cloſe, to make it go out at the top; I ſay it happens then, that this firſt <hi>Sap</hi> enters ſometimes, or the greateſt part of it, into the ſuperiour <hi>Branch,</hi> which is neareſt to that thickneſs, and which, however, had already a Portion ſuitable to its thickneſs.</p>
                        <p>If it cannot enter altogether in it, as it happens pretty often, the remainder of it is divided, and burſts out, as we have ſaid, upon the ſides of that ſmall thickneſs, and furniſhes us with ſome of thoſe good little <hi>Branches</hi> which vve deſire, as it appears by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes vve may alſo take avvay thoſe vvretched <hi>Branches</hi> ſlopingly, that is, cut them in ſuch a manner, that on the inſide of the <hi>Tree</hi> there may not remain the leaſt part, and on the outſide enough for ſome Nevv <hi>Branches</hi> to ſhoot out of it, as it appears like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>This ſloping way of <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be practis'd when the <hi>Branches,</hi> being neither altogether outward, nor yet wholly inward, they are a little upon the ſide, on which part however they cannot be preſerv'd; but yet are plac'd ſo, that by that ſlope one may expect the following year a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhooting wholly outwards.</p>
                        <p>Now ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> may chance to be thick, and conſequently capable of conducing to the Figure, or weak, and ſo fit to give <hi>Fruit;</hi> and in caſe, as it happens ſometimes, nothing proceeds from that ſlope, the Figure of our <hi>Tree</hi> will be no wiſe alter'd by it.</p>
                        <p>I dare be bold to ſay, that this <hi>Pruning</hi> in a ſloping manner, which is a New Invention, is an Excellent way of <hi>Pruning</hi> to be practis'd upon all ſorts of <hi>Trees</hi> that have a little Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, whether Old or Young, when ſome <hi>Branches,</hi> unhappily plac'd, as we have juſt explain'd it, give us cauſe to do it with hopes of ſucceſs: It is not indeed Infallible, but it ſucceeds very often, and for certain never ſpoils any thing: Therefore I adviſe others to uſe it as I do; I generally find a great deal of benefit by it, and am very well pleas'd with my ſelf for having invented it.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may not be improper to relate here what made me think upon it; I knew, as every body does, and as we have juſt obſerv'd it upon the account of the <hi>Pruning,</hi> which is perform'd within the thickneſs of a Crown Piece; I ſay I knew, that according to the Order of Nature, the <hi>Sap</hi> newly form'd in the Spring, regularly preſented it ſelf at the entrance of all the Channels of the <hi>Branches</hi> form'd the preceeding year, to Nouriſh, Thicken, and Lengthen them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo I knew that it was certainly to return to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perform its function in the <hi>Branch</hi> I took away, it being ignorant, as I may ſay, of its being taken away; therefore I concluded from thence, that apparently part of the <hi>Sap</hi> would make its way at the Place where it found it ſelf dam'd up, provided it found room enough to get out: So that, in leaving ſuch a Place on the outſide, a <hi>Branch</hi> would ſhoot from it to do me a kindneſs. Succeſs has confirm'd my Reaſoning, and Practice; and ſo from a <hi>Branch</hi> that was grown in an ill and troubleſom ſituation, I put my ſelf in a way of drawing a conſiderable advantage for my <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it ſhould happen as, ſometimes it does, that one of thoſe two firſt <hi>Branches,</hi> we ſpeak of in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſhould have produc'd from its <hi>Extremity</hi> but one thick enough, with ſome ſmall ones lower, whilſt her Neighbour has produc'd the two we expected; or this having really produc'd two, of which, one might be broken, or ſpoil'd by ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo that only one remain'd on that ſide: Theſe are two Caſes in which I think it very material to Explain what is to be done.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, which is the growing but of one <hi>Branch</hi> inſtead of two, which in Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were to have grown; in that firſt Caſe, I ſay, ſuppoſing there may be cauſe to judge, that the <hi>Prun'd Branch</hi> has not receiv'd ſo large a proportion of <hi>Sap</hi> as her Companion, which will appear in that, for Example, it ſhall not have thicken'd in proportion to the other, which proceeds from ſome inward, un-fore-ſeen, and inevitable defect; in that firſt Caſe, I ſay, this New <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be cut a little ſhorter, and that with a Proſpect that apparently it will yield but one, which conſequently muſt be expected on that ſide where it is moſt wanted for the Figure; with this Reſolve, that, if the following year the Original <hi>Branch</hi> ſhews no more Vigour than the fore-going year, neither it, nor its Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48210:147"/>
muſt hardly be look'd upon, but as <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> which cannot be laſting, and ſo we muſt be neceſſitated to endeavour betimes to eſtabliſh the foundation of the Beauty of our <hi>Tree</hi> upon the <hi>Branches</hi> that may proceed from its Neighbours.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Caſe, wherein one of the two New <hi>Branches</hi> which are grown from a Vigorous one, may have been torn off, or broken; in that ſecond Caſe, I ſay, whether the remaining <hi>Branch</hi> prove that which was grown on the Extremity, or that which was grown from the ſecond <hi>Eye,</hi> we may apparently reckon that the <hi>Sap</hi> which made the two, and would have nouriſh'd them both, had they remain'd, will come altogether into the remaining; and that ſo it muſt be <hi>Prun'd,</hi> in hopes that it will at leaſt produce two, which will be well plac'd, according to our wiſh, if, in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of it, we obſerve all that is neceſſary to be done; but above all, we muſt always take care not to let one ſide of the <hi>Tree</hi> grow higher than the other, for fear of the Deformity which attends that Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, which muſt be avoided as much as is poſſible: And therefore in <hi>Pruning</hi> ſuch a Vigorous <hi>Branch,</hi> which is left alone by ſome accident befaln to her Siſter, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the length of the new <hi>Pruning</hi> we perform upon it, to that we make upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Branch,</hi> which has not profited proportionably to what it had done the firſt year; and that in fine, until the whole Figure of ſuch a <hi>Teee</hi> comes to eſtabliſh it ſelf entirely upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> which ſucceſſively muſt come from the vigorous ſide, a Skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is ſufficiently the Maſter of ſuch an Operation.</p>
                        <p>If from the laſt <hi>Eye</hi> of one of the two firſt <hi>Branches,</hi> from which <hi>Eye,</hi> according to the Order of Nature, a thick one ſhould have proceeded; if ſuch a one, I ſay, ſhould bring forth a weak <hi>Branch,</hi> or even if the two laſt <hi>Eyes</hi> have produc'd two weak ones, which, as we have ſaid, regularly ſhould have given us two thick ones, and under theſe weak ones ſhould have grown one or two thick ones, or more, which happens ſometimes; in ſuch a Caſe, this, or theſe weak ones, muſt infallibly be look'd upon as <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> their weakneſs procuring them that Merit in regard to us; and ſo we ſhall preſerve them very preciouſly, breaking them as little as can be on their <hi>Extremities,</hi> in caſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too weak for their length, or leaving them untouch'd, if they ſeem well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd of themſelves: And this without doubt is one of the moſt material Advices I could give.</p>
                        <p>Woe to thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> which ſhall paſs through the hands of <hi>Gard'ners</hi> who will not be able to make uſe of this Advice, or ſhall take away thoſe weak <hi>Branches'</hi> as cauſing any deformity to the wretched Idea they have form'd to themſelves of a <hi>Tree,</hi> if they have really fram'd any, for the greateſt part of them ſeldom frame any; and cut pell-mell, whatever ſort of <hi>Branches</hi> fall under their Hands: Thoſe Wretches, in the firſt place, do not obſerve or mind that Fine <hi>Fruit</hi> never ſpoils any thing, what ever place it be in: In the ſecond, that it is a kind of Murther to take away a fine diſpoſition to <hi>Fruit</hi> when it is already form'd, although an ignorant Man does not know it; and that laſtly, the Beauty of the Figure of a <hi>Tree</hi> only conſiſts, and depends abſolutely upon the thick <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time, it is to be obſerv'd, that the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> that are thus grown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe weak ones, which are found on the <hi>Extremity;</hi> that thoſe thick <hi>Branches</hi> I ſay, ſhall commonly in that place have begun to follow the Order of Nature for the difference of their Thickneſs, and Length, in the ſame manner as if they had grown on that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,</hi> where Naturally they ought to be.</p>
                        <p>In that Caſe they muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> juſt as if they were really grown from that <hi>Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> that is, one or two of them muſt be preſerv'd, ſuppoſing they may contribute to the Figure; which being granted, they muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> of a reaſonable length, according to their Strength, and the Vigour of the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> ſtill preſerving the neceſſary regard that muſt be had for the <hi>Branches</hi> they are to <hi>ſhoot</hi> from the laſt <hi>Eyes</hi> of their new <hi>Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> and as for thoſe that might be prejudicial to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree;</hi> if there are really any ſuch, they muſt be taken away in the manner here above Explain'd; that is, within the thickneſs of a Crown Piece, or elſe ſlopingly, according to what may be beſt for the advantage of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I may begin to give notice here, that it happens ſometimes, and even pretty often, that this <hi>Branch</hi> which was left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> which in the order of Nature ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain weak, may, notwithſtanding, chance to thicken in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and perhaps produce one, or many thick ones on its <hi>Extremity,</hi> while that thoſe thick ones which had been <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſhort for <hi>Wood,</hi> remain almoſt in the ſame Condition, and only produce weak ones, the <hi>Sap</hi> having, as I may ſay, alter'd its Courſe, juſt as it happens ſometimes in ſome Rivers.</p>
                        <p>In ſuch a Caſe, we muſt ſubmit to that alteration, which cannot be prevented, nor hardly alter'd when once form'd; therefore we muſt begin the very next year after that alteration, to uſe that <hi>Branch</hi> like a <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> which having alter'd its property, is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48210:148"/>
become a <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> from being a <hi>Fruit-Branch;</hi> and ſo likewiſe alter our Method in reſpect to that which, from being a <hi>Wood-Branch,</hi> is become a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is nothing to be fear'd ſo much, as to ſee a <hi>Tree</hi> grow thin towards the bottom, which part ought to be fulleſt; which is the reaſon that I am ſo very ſollicitous, that no <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> ſhould ever be left long in the <hi>Pruning,</hi> unleſs it be perhaps on ſome here and there, as we have ſaid, to let them take up, for a Year or two, part of that <hi>Sap</hi> which might prove troubleſom to us, and afterwards remove them when the <hi>Tree</hi> bears <hi>Fruit;</hi> that is, it muſt be done ſometimes, when they are extraordinary vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> but as it is never done without good Grounds, ſo it ever proves advantageous.</p>
                        <p>This Way of <hi>Pruning</hi> thick <hi>Branches</hi> long, is a Fault moſt <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are guilty of, and that for want of knowing, or taking notice, that as the greateſt part of our <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> are not capable of furniſhing at one and the ſame time a great Extent, that is, to fill at once both the Top and Bottom; and that naturally, contrary to our Intention, and the Beauty we affect, they all incline to grow upwards, and conſequently, that Bottom which ſhou'd be fulleſt, remains moſt bare, unleſs we uſe a particular Application to oppoſe in this the Courſe of Nature, which ſeeks, it ſeems, to deceive us: Therefore a great deal of Care muſt be taken to ſtop, that is, to <hi>prune</hi> thoſe thick <hi>Branches</hi> ſhort enough, it being moſt certain that they never ſhoot much in the lower part, from whence they proceed; but only on their Extremity, whatever it be, high or low.</p>
                        <p>The Defect of Thinneſs, which is ſufficiently minded in <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> is yet much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> where, among unskilful <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> we ſeldom ſee any thing but the top of the Wall well cover'd, and that even <hi>Garland-</hi>wiſe, ſo that commonly all the new <hi>Branches</hi> exceed the top of it, and there ſpend the Vigour of the <hi>Tree</hi> to no purpoſe; which obliges them to cut thoſe wretched <hi>Branches</hi> four or five times in a Summer, to prevent the Diſorders of the Wind; while the Heart of the <hi>Tree</hi> is only compos'd of long, blackiſh, moſſy, wrinckled <hi>Branches,</hi> deſtitute of thoſe other little ones that ſhou'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them; and even often full of Scars, and conſequently, the Wall, which ſhou'd be cover'd every where, always beginning from the bottom, on the contrary, appears quite bare, and the <hi>Tree</hi> has none of thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> it ought to have.</p>
                        <p>Granting then, that a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> muſt ſeldom, or never be left long at the firſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> unleſs it be in order to form a <hi>Tree,</hi> or to fill up ſome parts of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt ſides, it is yet leſs allowable the following Years, upon the thick new <hi>Branch,</hi> which is grown from that which having been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> is afterwards grown thick, by an unexpected and extraordinary abundance of <hi>Sap.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is another dangerous Rock, from which few ſave themſelves: Therefore I am of Opinion, that, inſtead of performing our <hi>Pruning</hi> upon a thick and long <hi>Branch,</hi> ſhot from one that had been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> we ſhou'd deſcend, or come down to that old one, and ſhorten it, leaving it no more length than it might have been allow'd, had it been at firſt of the thickneſs it is grown ſince.</p>
                        <p>And if ſuch an old <hi>Branch</hi> ſhou'd not prove of an exceſſive length, it will be ſufficient to <hi>prune</hi> all the new ones that are grown from it ſo cloſe, that not the leaſt part of them may remain, whence any thing new might proceed.</p>
                        <p>In theſe two Caſes it is moſt certain, that ſuch an old <hi>Branch,</hi> ſo order'd, will not fail, at the very following Spring, to produce others on its Extremity; ſome for <hi>Fruit,</hi> and others for <hi>Wood;</hi> among which, thoſe muſt be choſen that are fitteſt for the Figure, to the end that, according to the Maxims heretofore eſtabliſh'd, they may be <hi>prun'd</hi> like thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and continu'd to be order'd as ſuch, while Nature cauſes no alteration in them.</p>

                        <p>In regard to which, I do not think I need add any thing to what I have ſaid of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the preceding, unleſs it be, that, to avoid Confuſion, every <hi>Branch</hi> may be allow'd two Inches more than thoſe we have been ſpeaking of, in order to procure both

Overture and Roundneſs to the <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> as well as Fulneſs and Roundneſs to the <hi>Eſpaliers;</hi> and therefore great regard muſt be had for the two or three laſt <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> on the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the <hi>prun'd Branches,</hi> to the end that thoſe that are to proceed from thoſe <hi>Eyes</hi> may be happily diſpos'd to contribute to the Beauty of the Figure.

                        <p>TO <hi>Prune</hi> for the ſecond time a <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firſt Year had produc'd four fine <hi>Branches,</hi> and even more, it is certain, that as this <hi>Tree</hi> has a great deal more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour than all the others we have mention'd, ſo it requires more Application and Skill, not to let it fall into thoſe Inconveniences wherewith it is threaten'd.</p>
                        <p>I muſt ſay here, that in ſuch a <hi>Tree,</hi> eſpecially in a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> it is neceſſary ſometimes to preſerve ſome <hi>Branches</hi> upon it, which at that time are no ways conducing to the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> but ſerve to conſume for a time part of the <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>As to thoſe that are eſſential for the Beauty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> I have begun to <hi>prune</hi> them all a little longer than thoſe of the preceding <hi>Trees;</hi> that is, about two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> at moſt; as well to avoid Confuſion, which is a very perniclous thing, and to be avoided at any rate, as to make an advantage of the Vigour of ſuch a <hi>Tree;</hi> which, without ſuch a precaution, wou'd not yield <hi>Fruit</hi> of a long time, becauſe the great abundance of <hi>Sap</hi> might convert into <hi>Branches</hi> all the <hi>Eyes</hi> that ſhou'd have turn'd into <hi>Flower-Buds,</hi> had their Nouriſhment been more moderate.</p>
                        <p>Such a <hi>Tree,</hi> at the End of the ſecond Year, appears in a manner quite form'd, by means of all the new <hi>Branches</hi> that every one of the old ones that have been <hi>prun'd</hi> ſhall have produc'd on their Extremities; and, among the new ones, Care muſt be taken to chuſe thoſe that conduce to the Beauty of the Figure, to <hi>prune</hi> them again, partly of the ſame length as thoſe had been <hi>prun'd</hi> for the firſt Time, from which they proceed; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, above all, to judge whether the <hi>Branch</hi> that has been <hi>prun'd</hi> may, at leaſt, produce two, in order to preſerve them both, if they prove fit to contribute to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: Or in caſe one muſt be quite taken away, let it commonly be the higheſt, to the end, that, as much as poſſible can be, the loweſt may always be preſerv'd, as the fitteſt to form or preſerve the Beauty we look for; and by that means, not only the place which is cut ſhall be (to uſe the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Term) quickly cover'd again, which is much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, as an Ornament in a <hi>Tree;</hi> but beſides, it will make no Wound upon the <hi>Branches</hi> that ſhall be preſerv'd; and conſequently, the <hi>Tree</hi> will thereby be infallibly handſomer and ſounder.</p>
                        <p>But if the Vigour of that <hi>Tree</hi> be obſerv'd to continue, as it is very common, and even to augment viſibly, in ſuch a Caſe Confuſion is to be fear'd more than ever, either in the Heart of our <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or in reſpect to our <hi>Wall-Fruit-Tree,</hi> whatever <hi>Trees</hi> they be, of either kind, <hi>Pear-Trees, Apple-Trees, Plum-Trees, Peach-Trees, Cherry-Trees, Fig-Trees, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore that ſecond <hi>Pruning</hi> muſt be perform'd yet a little longer than the firſt, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly if the <hi>Tree</hi> appears inclinable to cloſe; and that length muſt be about a large Foot, or a little more, to employ that abundance of <hi>Sap,</hi> which, we judge, muſt not be reſtrain'd, nor contain'd in a ſmall ſpace.</p>

                        <p>This great Fury ſeldom fails of diminiſhing at the End of the firſt five or ſix Years, if the <hi>Tree</hi> has been well govern'd; and then all thoſe little <hi>Branches</hi> which we have taken care to procure in a great number at the bottom, and have afterwards preſerv'd with Care, begin to give us an ample Recompence for all our Cares: And even pretty often, in ſuch Occaſions, we come to <hi>prune</hi> over again here and there ſome of the old <hi>Branches,</hi> which the great Vigour of the <hi>Tree</hi> had oblig'd us to leave of an extraordinary length; and at the ſame time we aim ſtill at extending, by way of Overture, on the ſides, there to employ uſefully the Vigour of that <hi>Tree,</hi> and indiſpenceably to preſerve its agreeable Figure.</p>
                        <p>It is upon thoſe very vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> that we muſt begin to perform ſome Maſterly Strokes: We muſt, as is done in point of <hi>Fountains,</hi> make here and there a kind of <hi>Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> or rather, a kind of Superficial Diſcharge; that is, for Example, leave upon that <hi>Tree,</hi> without any uſe, ſome <hi>Branches</hi> cut <hi>Stump-wiſe,</hi> and even ſome thick ones, though of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> in which, for ſome Years ſpace, that furious <hi>Sap,</hi> of which we have too much, may loſe it ſelf in vain, which otherwiſe might diſorder ſome of our principal Parts: And even, if upon thoſe ſort of <hi>Trees</hi> any <hi>Branches</hi> of falſe <hi>Wood</hi> be found in a place where they may ſerve towards the Figure of the <hi>Tree,</hi> they muſt be preſerv'd, and us'd as ſuch; being certain that, as they will take up the greateſt abundance of the <hi>Sap,</hi> the good <hi>Branches,</hi> which have produc'd thoſe falſe ones, will receive leſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the ſooner; theſe falſe <hi>Branches,</hi> in the mean time performing the ſame Effect, as to the Figure, as good ones cou'd have done.</p>
                        <p>Such <hi>Branches</hi> may likewiſe be left, where-ever the Overture of the <hi>Tree</hi> ſhall not be prejudic'd by them; from whence, the <hi>Tree</hi> bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> they may at pleaſure be taken away without any prejudice to the Figure; provided always they cauſe not the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that being the greateſt harm that can happen to a vigorous <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas, to moderate the great Fury of ſuch a <hi>Tree,</hi> in reſpect to our ſelves, that is, to make it bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the ſooner, two things are particularly required, beſides the Overture; which are, firſt, the length and multitude of good weak <hi>Branches,</hi> when they are plac'd ſo as to cauſe no Confuſion; and in the ſecond place, a conſiderable Plurality of Out-lets upon the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> through which that abundance of <hi>Sap</hi> may perform its Effect, ſince we cou'd not hinder it from doing it in ſome part of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, when the Figure of my Tree will permit it, if ſome <hi>Branch, prun'd</hi> the preceding Year, has produc'd three or four, all pretty thick ones, I often do not retrench them; ſo that having one or two of the beſt plac'd, I preſerve one or two of the others for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the next Year, and leave them reaſonably long. Beſides this, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the loweſt, I cut the higheſt <hi>Stump-wiſe;</hi> and when I preſerve the higheſt, I leave under them, either on the out-ſide, or upon the ſides, one or two <hi>Stumps</hi> of the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> form'd like the <hi>Hooks</hi> of a <hi>Vine,</hi> each about two Inches in length, as it appears by the Figure annex'd hereunto; which ſucceeds very well to me.</p>
                        <p>There infallibly happens in thoſe <hi>Stumps,</hi> or <hi>Hooks,</hi> a Diſcharge of <hi>Sap,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſome favourable <hi>Branches,</hi> either for <hi>Fruit</hi> when they prove weak, or to become in time fit <hi>Branches</hi> for the Figure when they are ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>The beſt way always is to lower the <hi>Tree,</hi> in taking away the higheſt <hi>Branches,</hi> to preſerve the loweſt; and not take away the loweſt, to preſerve the higheſt; to the end, that if the <hi>Tree</hi> cannot fill both at top and bottom, it may rather be diſpos'd to remain low, and well fill'd, than to riſe high, without being well fill'd.</p>
                        <p>Theſe kind of <hi>Stumps</hi> and <hi>Hooks</hi> will not pleaſe our <hi>Gard'ners</hi> at firſt, who neither know my Principles, nor the way of <hi>Cupping;</hi> which we have explain'd here above: But if, after having known my Reaſons, and long Experience, they will neither approve, or try them, ſo much the worſe for them; they muſt give me leave to pity their Ignorance, or Obſtinacy.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the <hi>Pruning</hi> that muſt be perform'd the Third Year, upon all ſorts of <hi>Trees planted</hi> within Four Years.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THis Caſe does not require the preceding Diſtinctions we have made, to determine what was to be done to <hi>Trees,</hi> according to the ſmaller or greater quantity of <hi>Branches</hi> they had produc'd the firſt Year: They muſt, at the end of four Years, be partly all of the ſame Claſſis, though they be not all furniſh'd with an equal quantity of thick <hi>Branches:</hi> But however, both the one and the other muſt have produc'd a ſufficient number, to ſhew a <hi>Head</hi> entirely form'd; and though even that, for Example, which had produc'd but one the firſt Year, ſhou'd have produc'd but four or five in the fourth, ſtill there ſhou'd be nothing to be ſaid in reſpect to that, ſince that, if it be vigorous, it will partly fall under the Caſe of a <hi>Tree</hi> which at firſt had produc'd four or five, or more; and if it be not of thoſe that are capable of producing more than one thick <hi>Branch</hi> on the Extremity of the <hi>Pruning,</hi> you muſt regulate your ſelf upon the meanneſs of its Vigour, both in keeping the thickeſt <hi>Branches</hi> ſhort, and expecting but one thick one on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of each, making it ever grow on that part where the Figure requires it moſt.</p>
                        <p>We muſt always inviolably follow the <hi>Idea</hi> of a fine <hi>Tree</hi> we have firſt of all propos'd to our ſelves, either in a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> and never fail to proportion the Burthen of the Head to the Vigour of the Foot, in leaving more and longer <hi>Branches</hi> on a vigorous <hi>Tree,</hi> and leſs and ſhorter on that which appears weak.</p>
                        <p>And whereas many old <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be carefully preſerv'd on a vigorous <hi>Tree,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for <hi>Fruit,</hi> provided there be no Confuſion; on the contrary, you muſt eaſe a weak <hi>Tree</hi> of the Burthen of the old <hi>Branches,</hi> as well thoſe that are for <hi>Wood,</hi> as thoſe that are for <hi>Fruit;</hi> and out them ſhort, in order to make it ſhoot new ones, if it can, with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pull it out of the <hi>Ground,</hi> if not able to perform it; which being done, a better muſt be plac'd in its room, after having taken away all the old <hi>Earth,</hi> which may be judg'd to be either ill, or worn out, and having put new in the room of it.</p>
                        <p>I ſtill forewarn, that, in <hi>Pruning,</hi> Proviſion muſt be made for thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thoſe that are <hi>Pruning,</hi> in order to prepare ſome that may be proper for the Figure, with this Aſſurance, that when a high <hi>Branch</hi> is taken down over a lower, this being ſtrengthen'd by all the Nouriſhment that wou'd have gone to the higheſt, which has been taken away; this low <hi>Branch,</hi> I ſay, will produce more <hi>Branches</hi> than it ſhou'd have done, had it receiv'd no Re-inforcement.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, when, according to my Principles, a young <hi>Tree</hi> ſhall have been conducted to a fourth <hi>Pruning,</hi> the Effect will infallibly have made good what I have promis'd, both as to the beautiful Figure, which muſt then appear in its prime, and as to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which, <hi>Pears</hi> then begin to ſhew a Sample, and <hi>Stone-Fruit</hi> abundance: After this, apparently every body muſt be capable thenceforward to manage all manner of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> without needing any other Inſtructions than the preceding; and indeed, I have no other new ones to give; and it wou'd be ridiculous and tireſom to repeat the ſame things, which, in my Opinion, I have ſufficiently eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                        <p>It ſeldom happens, that all the <hi>Trees</hi> of the ſame <hi>Garden,</hi> though order'd alike, prove equally vigorous; no more than the Children of the ſame Father, all equally healthy: <hi>Trees,</hi> as well as Men, are ſubject to an infinite number of Accidents, that can neither be fore-ſeen, nor avoided; but it is certain, that all the <hi>Trees</hi> of a <hi>Garden</hi> may be form'd agreeably in their Figure; and this is one of the principal things to which a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is oblig'd.</p>
                        <p>Above all, I adviſe every body not to be obſtinate in preſerving <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> which year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, towards the end of Summer, grow extream yellow, without having produc'd fine <hi>Shoots;</hi> nor thoſe, of which the Extremities of the <hi>Branches</hi> likewiſe die every Year. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Trees graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince;</hi> of which, ſome of the principal <hi>Roots</hi> are dead, or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotten: They are <hi>Trees</hi> that produce but ſmall <hi>Roots</hi> at the upper part of the Foot, and conſequently, <hi>Roots</hi> that are expos'd to all the Injuries of the Air, and of the <hi>Spade.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid of the <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> that appear the firſt Years to gather <hi>Gum</hi> at the greateſt part of their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and of thoſe that are extreamly attack'd with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little <hi>Fleas</hi> and <hi>Piſmires.</hi> Such <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> have certainly ſome rotten <hi>Roots,</hi> and will never do well.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48210:151"/>
I am likewiſe of the ſame Opinion for thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> that ſhoot on all ſides an infinite number of little, weak, ſapleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> with ſome thick ones here and there; both the one and the other, for the moſt part, of falſe <hi>Wood:</hi> In which caſe, a great deal of time may be loſt upon ill-grounded hopes.</p>
                        <p>That which is beſt to be done in all theſe Occaſions, is, as ſoon as can be to remove ſuch <hi>Trees;</hi> and when they are not extreamly old, or ſpoil'd by the <hi>Roots,</hi> venture to plant them again in ſome other place, in good <hi>Ground,</hi> after having cleans'd them of all their <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs</hi> and <hi>Cankers,</hi> in order to ſee if they will come to any thing, to make uſe of them elſewhere; which happens ſometimes with <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> but very ſeldom with <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> ſtill putting better in the room of them, with all the Conditions heretofore explain'd.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> that have been <hi>Planted</hi> with many <hi>Branches.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFter having ſufficiently explain'd, in the Treatiſe of <hi>Plantations,</hi> my Averſion to <hi>plant</hi> little <hi>Trees</hi> with many <hi>Branches,</hi> I am willing at preſent to believe, that as I ſeldom <hi>plant</hi> any, thoſe who will do me the honour to imitate me, will do the ſame. However, Thoſe that will <hi>plant</hi> ſuch, muſt principally obſerve two things: The firſt is, to cut off whatever may cauſe a Confuſion, and is not proper to begin a fine Figure. The ſecond, to leave a Length of about ſix or ſeven Inches to every <hi>Branch</hi> they preſerve upon them: And as for the other <hi>Branches</hi> that ſhall proceed from theſe, they muſt regulate themſelves upon the Principles which we have ſufficiently eſtabliſh'd for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of other <hi>Trees:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is certain, that ſuch <hi>Trees, planted</hi> with <hi>Branches,</hi> are not commonly ſo eaſily turn'd to receive a fine Figure, as thoſe I affect to <hi>plant:</hi> The old <hi>Branches</hi> that are left upon them, are not often happy in producing others on their Extremity, yet leſs to have them well-plac'd; they generally produce them diſorderly, and conſequently muſt be often wounded, before what is deſir'd can be met with; but when at laſt attain'd, 'tis but following what has been ſaid diſtinctly enough for the management of a <hi>Tree,</hi> which having been <hi>planted</hi> without any <hi>Branches,</hi> has ſince produc'd ſome very fine ones, and very well plac'd.</p>
                        <p>And when <hi>Trees</hi> have been planted with a great many more and longer <hi>Branches</hi> than they ſhou'd have been, ſo that there appears no manner of diſpoſition towards the Figure we ought to wiſh for, Endeavours muſt be us'd immediately to reduce them upon a fine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that conformably to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Beauty ſo often explain'd.</p>
                        <p>What we ſhall ſay hereafter, for the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of old <hi>Trees,</hi> that have never been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd well, may ſerve altogether for the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of theſe, without ſaying any thing more about it.</p>
                        <p>Though commonly, either as to low <hi>Standards,</hi> or <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> I condemn the manner of <hi>Planting</hi> little <hi>Trees</hi> with many <hi>Branches,</hi> by reaſon of the Inconveniences which attend them, in reſpect to the Figure they ought to have, I am not, however, ſo ſevere in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to high <hi>Standards,</hi> in which I do not condemn it ſo much, by reaſon that they do not require ſo great an Exactneſs for their Beauty: So that I allow they ſhou'd be <hi>planted</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſome <hi>Branches</hi> on their heads, when ſome are found well enough diſpos'd for it; they will certainly produce <hi>Fruit</hi> ſooner than the others: But ſtill I have a particular Eſteem for thoſe that are <hi>planted</hi> without any.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome other Occaſions in which a <hi>Tree</hi> may be <hi>planted</hi> with many <hi>Branches;</hi> and that is, in a great <hi>Plantation,</hi> where ſome other is dead; for ſuppoſing the <hi>Ground</hi> to be very good, and other good <hi>Mould</hi> put into the Hole, made to <hi>plant</hi> the other, in ſuch a Caſe a <hi>Tree</hi> may very well be planted with ſome <hi>Branches,</hi> eſpecially thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> that are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to <hi>fructifie.</hi> For Example, your <hi>Lady-Thigh, Pears</hi> without <hi>Rinds, Virgoulez, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>AS the Number of Principles for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Dwarf-Trees</hi> has been very great, ſo the number of Principles for <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>High-Standards</hi> Planted in open Wind, ſhall be very ſmall: For as to <hi>High-ſtandards</hi> Planted againſt a Wall, they all require the ſame Precautions as the little ones; ſo that inſtead of medling yearly with thoſe Great <hi>Trees,</hi> I only deſire, as I have ſaid in the beginning of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> that they ſhould be touch'd once or twice in the beginnings, that is, in the three or four firſt years, in order to remove ſome <hi>Branches</hi> from the middle, which might cauſe a confuſion there; or to ſhorten a ſide which riſes too much, or bring another nearer, which extends farther than in reaſon it ought to do: As for the remainder, we muſt refer it to Nature, and let her produce freely what ſhe can, there would be too much pain and labour to order theſe with as much Circumſpection as the others.</p>

                           <p>Of the firſt Conduct of <hi>Graffs</hi> in Slits made and multiply'd upon Old <hi>Trees,</hi> in place, either <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Eſpaliers.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>NOthing is ſo common in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> as to <hi>Graff</hi> in Slits upon Old <hi>Trees,</hi> be it either to be rid of ſome ill <hi>Fruit</hi> we are weary of, or to improve ſome conſiderable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty that has been diſcover'd; ſo that often we do not even ſpare good kinds, of ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> of which we have a ſufficient Number.</p>
                        <p>Now as many things are to be ſaid upon thoſe ſort of <hi>Graffs,</hi> and firſt, if the <hi>Tree</hi> has ſo little thickneſs as not to be able to receive above one, as none are commonly apply'd without having three <hi>Eyes;</hi> it may very well happen that every ſuch <hi>Graff</hi> ſhall produce three fine <hi>Branches</hi> fit to lay the foundation of a fine <hi>Tree;</hi> in which Caſe, we muſt have recourſe to what we have ſaid heretofore of the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> which in the firſt year had produc'd three fair <hi>Shoots;</hi> and may allow them about two or three <hi>Eyes</hi> more in length; if, as in all likelyhood it ought to happen, the <hi>Graff</hi> has produc'd very Vigorous <hi>Twigs,</hi> eſpecially if the <hi>Tree</hi> appears inclinable to cloſe.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, if the <hi>Tree</hi> to be <hi>Graffed</hi> is thick enough to receive two <hi>Graffs,</hi> as it is when it has a good Inch Diameter, or a little more; and if the two <hi>Graffs</hi> produce each two or three fine <hi>Branches,</hi> as it happens pretty often, then it is fit to ſtudy hard to avoid the great confuſion that is threaten'd here by the great Proximity of <hi>Graffs,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we muſt ſtudy to open; therefore among thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> thoſe that being thick and inwards, form that defect which we muſt never ſuffer, muſt be taken away, either within the thickneſs of a Crown Piece, or ſlopingly, according as the Prudence of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and the occaſion of the <hi>Tree</hi> ſhall preſcribe: After which, not only the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> ſhall be perform'd a little longer than that of the <hi>Trees</hi> that have been <hi>Planted</hi> within a year or two, but a greater quantity of <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be kept upon them, as well quickly to finiſh the Figure, if the Matter be fit for it, as to imploy for a certain time the overplus of <hi>Sap</hi> we judge fit for our Deſigns, and that Plurality of <hi>Branches</hi> may comprehend thoſe <hi>Stumps</hi> and temporary <hi>Branches,</hi> as well as kind of <hi>Hooks</hi> that are on the outſide, which I have ſpoken of heretofore.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, the ſame regards muſt be obſerv'd, and with more ſeverity, as well for the Overture, as for the length of the firſt <hi>Prunings,</hi> if the <hi>Graffed Tree</hi> has been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving upon its head to the number of three or four <hi>Graffs,</hi> which happens when you <hi>Graff</hi> Crown-wiſe.</p>
                        <p>So much the rather, if the <hi>Tree</hi> having ſeveral thick <hi>Branches</hi> all pretty near the one to the other, and all capable of receiving ſeveral <hi>Graffs</hi> on the Head, it comes to be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon every one of them. Such a <hi>Tree</hi> is apparently a little Old, and yet vigorous enough, ſo that all the <hi>Sap</hi> which was prepar'd by the great number of its <hi>Roots,</hi> and was ſufficient for the Nouriſhment and Maintenance of a great quantity of long and ſtrong <hi>Branches,</hi> finding it ſelf pent up in the little compaſs of thoſe <hi>Graffs,</hi> produces generally there <hi>Branches</hi>

                        <p>In ſuch Caſes, all the Prudence of a Skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is requir'd to make a good uſe of that great Vigour thus reduc'd, to the end that by means of a wiſe Conduct in a ſhort time a <hi>Tree</hi> may be brought to a fine Figure, and to bear a great deal: Nothing is more common than to ſee ſuch <hi>Graffs</hi> ill order'd, and, if I may ſay ſo, Cobbled and Maſſacred; and Conſequently woe to that <hi>Tree,</hi> which for the firſt time falls under the hands of an ignorant <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>

                           <p>Of what is to be done in Caſes not foreſeen, and yet pretty common to all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> even to thoſe that have been manag'd according to all the Rules of Art.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Think I may ſuppoſe, that whoever has with a ſufficient application read over what I have eſtabliſh'd here for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> has acquir'd a ſufficient Knowledge, either to underſtand it well, or to put it in Practice with Pleaſure and Advantage: To tell the Truth, I ſhould be infinitely deceiv'd if it were not ſo, having made it my ſtudy with all the Care imaginable, to render my ſelf intelligible, as well to the Ignorant, and the Novice, as to the Man of Underſtanding, whether <hi>Gard'ner</hi> or not, who ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know my Sentiments upon this Matter. But I muſt add to this, that yet to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to a greater perfection of Knowledge, it will be neceſſary, for two or three years, to endeavour the putting in Practice upon young <hi>Trees</hi> both the Principles and Manner I uſe: Experience far exceeding Theory, or Speculation in this Caſe, as well as in all other practicable Arts and Sciences.</p>
                        <p>I dare affirm, that hardly any difficulty would ever be found in the Application of theſe Principles, if, as I may ſay, Nature was always wiſe in the Production of <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Fruits;</hi> or if ſhe could be govern'd as the Carver governs his Marble, and the Painter his Colours; but it is certain, that whatever care we take for the Conduct of our <hi>Trees,</hi> yet we cannot always Labour about them with ſo much ſucceſs, as to oblige Nature, which we are not altogether maſters of, on all Occaſions to anſwer our Intentions and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                        <p>Nature is a particular Agent, but yet a neceſſary one, which in her Actions depends upon an infinite number of Circumſtances, either as to Times, and Seaſons, or Grounds, of which, ſome are Good, and others Bad; ſome Hot, ſome Cold, ſome Dry, ſome

Moiſt; or Laſtly, in relation to the different temper of <hi>Trees,</hi> of which ſome are apter to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> than others; ſome to produce more <hi>Branches,</hi> others leſs, ſome for Stone-<hi>Fruit,</hi> others for Kernel; and ſome others are even of a particular kind; as <hi>Figgs, Grapes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether I might not ſay, that pretty often the Rules for <hi>Pruning</hi> are in ſome reſpects the ſame in relation to <hi>Trees,</hi> as the Rules of <hi>Chriſtian Morality</hi> are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Conduct of Men; our <hi>Trees</hi> to me, ſeem impatient under the Conſtraint we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon them, to keep them low; and ſometimes tack'd againſt a Wall; they ſeem to aim conſtantly at their eſcape, and to ſurprize the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> to ſhoot where he would not have them, and produce <hi>Branches</hi> where he would have none; juſt as the Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man often Rebels againſt the Divine Laws and Reaſon, and affects moſt of thoſe things which Morality forbids.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe true, that in our <hi>Trees</hi> there ſometimes happen certain Inconveniencies, which we could neither foreſee, nor hinder; but at leaſt, when they are come to paſs, we muſt apply our ſelves to avoid the ill Conſequences that might attend them; and moreover, if it be poſſible, as I have pretty often Cauſe to believe it may; we muſt endeavour to draw Advantages from them.</p>
                        <p>There are in this certain Particulars, which may prove tireſom to ſome Readers, I mean ſuch as have no occaſion for them, or ſuch as do not care to underſtand <hi>Pruning</hi> to the bottom; but I hope they may prove of great uſe, or at leaſt afford ſome Pleaſure to true <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who are ſenſible that nothing is ſo proper to improve in all manner of Sciences, as thoſe ſtudied and inſtructive Particulars.</p>
                        <p>I have in my time made many Remarks upon ſeveral particular Caſes relating to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of all manner of <hi>Trees;</hi> which I look upon as proper to be added here, together with the Conduct I have held towards them.</p>
                        <p>But firſt, I think my ſelf oblig'd to ſay that <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Peuch-Trees,</hi> and even <hi>Apricocks,</hi> greatly require a ſecond <hi>Pruning,</hi> and ſometimes a third, beſides the firſt which is done at the end of Winter: Thoſe laſt <hi>Prunings</hi> muſt be perform'd towards the middle of <hi>May,</hi> when the <hi>Fruit</hi> is either knit, or blaſted: At which time, I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they are not only advantageous, but even very neceſſary; at the ſame time you muſt likewiſe Trim the <hi>Buds</hi> and uſeleſs <hi>Branches</hi> of ſome others, which is no leſs neceſſary than thoſe kind of <hi>Prunings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe laſt Operations, <hi>Viz.</hi> the ſecond and third <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> and the Trimming of the <hi>Buds</hi> and uſeleſs <hi>Branches</hi> of all manner of <hi>Trees,</hi> are neceſſary, both to ſtrengthen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Branches,</hi> which may be of uſe for the future to make <hi>Branches</hi> for Wood, as well as to take away intirely ſome that are grown uſeleſs, and inconvenient; their Function which was to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> not having ſucceeded, their <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> being deſtroy'd. I will make a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chapter of this hereafter, after having explain'd all the Particulars I have mention'd for <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All theſe I have divided into Four Claſſis; of which the firſt conſiſts of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks that are generally common for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of all manner of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> This Claſſis has a pretty large extent, and ſhall be the firſt I will Explain.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Shall not need to inlarge upon this Article, of the firſt <hi>Pruning;</hi> having already largely explain'd in General the Rules for all ſorts of <hi>Pruning:</hi> I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> of the <hi>Trees</hi> above-mention'd, are but of a ſmall Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, many of them Periſhing the very firſt year in which they have produc'd <hi>Fruit,</hi> and even without it, their <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> having been ſpoil'd, either by <hi>Gum, Blaſts,</hi> or <hi>Froſts</hi> in the Spring; in which Caſes, they muſt be wholly taken away, unleſs they be grown conſiderably thick, or have ſhot ſome fine <hi>Branches</hi> fit to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the following year; for in that Caſe, they may laſt two years, and even ſometimes, though very ſeldom, three or four; provided they ſtill ſhoot ſome good <hi>Branches,</hi> either on the Extremity of the laſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> or in their extent: But after that, they muſt only be look'd upon as worn-out <hi>Branches,</hi> and conſequently of no uſe.</p>
                        <p>It is not ſo with the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> of <hi>Pear</hi> and <hi>Apple-Trees;</hi> and even <hi>Plumb-Trees,</hi> both the one and the other laſting pretty long, that is, much longer than thoſe of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> by reaſon, that in their extent they ſhoot very good ſmall ones, which regularly produce <hi>Fruit;</hi> until at laſt, according to the Nature of <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> they all periſh intirely.</p>
                        <p>I may ſay here, without any Vanity, that in following my Method of <hi>Pruning Peach-Trees,</hi> you may expect to have commonly much finer <hi>Trees,</hi> more laſting, and without doubt much more <hi>Fruit,</hi> and even much finer than thoſe who <hi>Prune</hi> another way, which is Infallible; provided the Weather be fair at the time of the <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> and the <hi>Gum</hi> ſpoil nothing about the <hi>Branches,</hi> and eſpecially, that the <hi>Trees</hi> be Planted in a good Ground. The Curious are much to be pity'd, when their <hi>Gardens</hi> happen to be in a cold ill Ground, or when the Mould is worn, becauſe that the <hi>Trees</hi> ſeldom produce any good new <hi>Roots</hi> there; and conſequently, abundance of the old ones periſh, <hi>Roots</hi> not being able to ſubſiſt without Action; which is the Reaſon that ſo much Gum grows both upon the <hi>Stem,</hi> and upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> and even upon the Foot, and in the <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48210:158"/>
The Reaſon for which I ſay that my Method of <hi>Pruning</hi> greatly preſerves and imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes the <hi>Trees,</hi> is becauſe it preſcribes the being very careful in keeping pretty ſhort all the thick <hi>Branches, &amp;c.</hi> And as for the abundance of fine <hi>Fruits,</hi> it depends Infallibly on the other Caution I recommend, of preſerving all the good <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> without taking away any, and the leaving no more <hi>Fruit</hi> upon them than they are able to nouriſh, in order to its being very Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>When in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> you deſign to perform the firſt <hi>Pruning</hi> upon <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and that, after having taken away all the Old dry <hi>Branches,</hi> or ſuch, which through an extream weakneſs, are of no uſe (for you muſt begin by this, in order to ſee clearly and diſtinctly what is to be done) you find only two ſorts of good <hi>Branches</hi> remaining; of which, the one (which are weak ones) are to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> the following years, the <hi>Buds</hi> being already form'd; and the others (which are the ſtrong ones) are not commonly to produce any, not having any <hi>Buds</hi> upon them, but are to ſerve us for another uſe, which is very material.</p>
                        <p>Theſe weak ones are to be preſerv'd with Care, and even of a great length, by reaſon of the viſible appearance of preſent <hi>Fruit,</hi> but without building any hopes upon moſt of them for the following year; Nature will afford us others, to ſupply the loſs of thoſe; but ſtill care muſt be taken, that the length of thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> be proportion'd to their ſtrength; being alſo perſwaded, that a <hi>Branch</hi> of an ordinary thickneſs is capable of nouriſhing a conſiderable part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> it ſeems diſpos'd to bear: So that, at the firſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> there is no danger in venturing to leave much upon it, provided part be taken away at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, if there be Reaſon to believe there is too much.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſtrong ones, they muſt particularly be look'd upon in relation to the future, and therefore muſt be cut ſhort, in proſpect, that, according to the Order of Nature, they will produce others of two kinds; ſome thick ones for <hi>Wood,</hi> and many ſmall ones for <hi>Fruit;</hi> which will certainly come to paſs: But, above all, Care muſt be taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the <hi>Branches</hi> that are to fill up the room of thoſe ſlender ones, which, for the time being, produce ſo good an Effect, but are, as it were, no longer to be look'd upon as living, ſince, after their having produc'd their <hi>Fruit,</hi> they muſt be taken away.</p>
                        <p>We have ſufficiently explain'd the difference there is between weak <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> ones; therefore it will ſuffice to ſay, that no long <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be preſerv'd, unleſs they be of a moderate thickneſs, and have at the ſame time <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> ready form'd for the preſent Year. I commonly call none <hi>Buds</hi> but ſuch as are double, with an <hi>Eye</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> in the middle; and I value no others for Preſerving, unleſs it be on <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Peaches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, no <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſhort, unleſs it be, that, being incapable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fruit</hi> in the preſent Year, their Strength or Vigour may promiſe other <hi>Branches</hi> for the following Year; or that the <hi>Tree</hi> having a vaſt quantity of <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> and very few for <hi>Wood,</hi> and all thoſe very high, there may be reaſon to fear, that ſome of the lower parts, or the middle, may grow too thin for the following Years; in which Caſe, it is very proper to ſacrifice ſome <hi>Buds;</hi> and to that End, ſhorten ſome of the fineſt and thickeſt among thoſe that are over-burthen'd by them, and ſo make them, as we have ſaid elſewhere, <hi>Demy-Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> which is of very good uſe.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time we muſt obſerve that there are ſome very vigorous <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> which commonly are hard to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> upon which it is neceſſary, as well as upon ſome furious <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> to leave <hi>Branches</hi> of a moderate thickneſs, long, though they have no <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> at all. Such furious <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are your <hi>Magdalens,</hi> ſome white <hi>Baſtard-Peaches, Bourdins, Brugnons,</hi> or Latter <hi>Violets, &amp;c.</hi> that is, when thoſe <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are young: Upon ſuch it is neceſſary to leave ſome long <hi>Branches,</hi> though without any appearance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> upon the apparent certainty of their producing a great many other weak <hi>Branches</hi> for the following Year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>; and though thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> be pretty thick, and might be look'd upon as <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> yet they are not cut ſhort, becauſe it is probable that in their Neighbourhood there may be other thicker that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> and that, according to the beſt Rules, many thick <hi>Branches</hi> muſt never be left very near one to another.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe different ways of Cutting long or ſhort, are the Cauſe that it cannot, and muſt not be ſaid that a <hi>Peach-Tree</hi> is well <hi>Prun'd,</hi> unleſs every <hi>Branch;</hi> has one of thoſe two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, either actually fit to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> in the preſent Year, or to produce fine <hi>Wood</hi> the Year following, in thoſe places where it may be requir'd; and when theſe two Conditions meet, and are perfectly obſerv'd, we may ſay that a <hi>Peach-Tree</hi> is very well <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe kind of Regards muſt not only be had at the time of the firſt <hi>Pruning,</hi> but, yet particularly, at the time of the ſecond and third, if perform'd; and likewiſe at the time of the <hi>Trimming</hi> of the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uſeleſs <hi>Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48210:159"/>
The Miſchief which attends <hi>Gum,</hi> to which every body knows <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject, and even much beyond all other <hi>Stone-Fruits,</hi> hinders us from having any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that a thick <hi>Branch,</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> will produce others on its Extremity; which is almoſt infallible in <hi>Pear, Plumb,</hi> and <hi>Apricock-Trees, &amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> appear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd with that <hi>Gum,</hi> and yet the Owners are willing to preſerve them ſome Years longer, they muſt <hi>Prune</hi> them late, that is, about the time they begin to <hi>bloſſom</hi> and <hi>ſhoot,</hi> to be certain of preſerving, at leaſt, ſome good <hi>Eyes,</hi> and ſome good <hi>Bloſſoms:</hi> There can be no Certainty before that time.</p>
                        <p>I add farther, that when a <hi>Peach-Tree</hi> has produc'd no <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> it muſt no longer be conſider'd as a <hi>Tree</hi> to keep, from the time the <hi>Fruit</hi> has been gather'd; and a Succeſſor muſt be provided.</p>
                        <p>I add beſides, that if it happens that an old <hi>Peach-Tree,</hi> having been ſhorten'd, has produc'd ſeveral <hi>Branches,</hi> which happens but ſeldom, unleſs it be a <hi>Tree</hi> grown from a <hi>Stone,</hi> you muſt begin to <hi>Prune</hi> it upon thoſe new <hi>Branches,</hi> in the ſelf-ſame manner as a young <hi>Tree</hi> is <hi>Prun'd;</hi> excepting only, that the <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be left a little longer, for fear of the <hi>Gum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is almoſt impoſſible not to be very uneaſie at the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> by reaſon of an itching deſire of preſerving all the <hi>Buds</hi> that are ready form'd for the preſent Year, and of not depriving ones ſelf of a preſent Good: But yet, unleſs you be a little hard-hearted for the preſent, in proſpect of the future, you may aſſure your ſelves to ſee thoſe kind of <hi>Trees</hi> periſh by your own Fault, or, at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of no uſe. 'Tis true, that in ſo doing, you may perhaps get abundance of <hi>Fruit</hi> for two or three Years; but it is as true, that after that, you muſt expect a very great Scarcity, and very ugly <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe Uneaſineſſes, or Conflicts, I have mention'd, are only undergone by skilful <hi>Gard'ners:</hi> Others are not ſo much as ſenſible of the Danger, and ſo are liable to no manner of Agitation. The chief Cauſe of Diſquiet is, particularly, when a weak <hi>Branch,</hi> that had been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> is grown thick, contrary to the common Order of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that the thick one, which had been cut ſhort, in order to <hi>ſhoot</hi> abundance of new ones, is, as it were, abandon'd, and hardly produces any thing. This Alteration ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally produces a great Diſorder in a <hi>Tree;</hi> for thoſe kind of <hi>Branches</hi> that are grown thick, have probably ſhot a great many <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> which occaſions a very great and juſt Cauſe of Temptation and Deſire of preſerving them all: So that, unleſs the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of having a fine and laſting <hi>Tree</hi> oppoſes the Itch of preſerving thoſe Appearances of preſent <hi>Fruit,</hi> there is a great deal of danger of being overcome by the Temptation; and conſequently, of making ſoon a very ugly <hi>Tree,</hi> as we have already inſtanc'd. Therefore it is very material to examine what is moſt proper to be done in ſuch Conjunctures.</p>
                        <p>It is ſometimes neceſſary to take the advantage of ſuch a Diſorder, to let the <hi>Tree ſhoot</hi> up, in order to cover the Top of a Wall, which may very well be allow'd of; and in ſuch a Caſe, there will be no need of taking any of theſe terrible Reſolutions: But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there may be a great deal of danger in ſo doing; in which Caſe, there is a neceſſity of reſolving to ſacrifice part of thoſe fine Appearances of <hi>Fruit,</hi> without any Mercy, and conſequently, to ſhorten ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> extreamly, in proſpect, that in the following Years you ſhall be recompenc'd a hundred times for thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> which, as I may ſay, have been thus cruelly deſtroy'd. This Diſorder happens but ſeldom, which is a Comfort; but yet, as it happens ſometimes, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to give my Opinion about it.</p>
                        <p>When Walls are very low, for Example, about ſix or ſeven Foot high, and yet People deſire to have <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> againſt them, which, in ſuch a Caſe, muſt be <hi>Planted</hi> at a great diſtance from one another; when, I ſay, along ſuch low Walls <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> appear to be very vigorous, for the two firſt Years the thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are to fill up the Sides muſt be kept pretty long, becauſe, that in <hi>Pruning</hi> of them ſhort, they will only <hi>ſhoot Falſe-Wood,</hi> or <hi>Suckers,</hi> and ſeldom or never produce any <hi>Fruit,</hi> you may allow them twice the length of what is allow'd to common <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and ſometimes even thrice; that is, a Foot and a half, or ſomewhat more.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> is reaſonably vigorous, it muſt of neceſſity be allow'd at leaſt three Foot of Wall free, above the <hi>Pruning</hi> that is perform'd upon it in the Spring, for the placing of the new <hi>Shoots;</hi> otherwiſe the greateſt part of the principal <hi>Branches</hi> ſhould be of no uſe, growing over the Top; and there ſhould be a neceſſity of Cutting them often during the Summer, leſt the great Winds ſhould break them: And, beſides the Vexation of not enjoying the Benefit of the Vigour of ones <hi>Trees,</hi> thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> thus cut, ever look ungainly upon a <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> by the quantity of <hi>Furzes</hi> that appear at the Extremity of ſuch a <hi>Tree.</hi>

                           <p>Particular Remarks upon the Second and Third <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THeſe Second and Third <hi>Prunings</hi> are altogether new, and yet are altogether as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and material as the firſt, and muſt be perform'd about the middle of <hi>May</hi> only upon weak <hi>Branches:</hi> They were left long by the Winter-<hi>Pruning,</hi> in proſpect of abundance of <hi>Fruit;</hi> but whereas they are ſubject to certain Circumſtances we are going to examine, they made us bethink our ſelves of the neceſſity of a ſecond Operation, and ſometimes of a third.</p>
                        <p>As to the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſhort in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> they have ſufficiently undergone the Diſpenſation of the <hi>Knife,</hi> they require no more of it, their Function not being to produce any thing that wants Retrenching at this time; but, on the contrary, to <hi>ſhoot</hi> many precious <hi>Branches,</hi> that deſerve to be preſerv'd with much Care.</p>
                        <p>Theſe laſt <hi>Prunings,</hi> we are now explaining, are of great uſe for the grand <hi>Pruning</hi> that is to be perform'd the following Year, in cleanſing a <hi>Tree</hi> from all ſuperfluous and half-dead <hi>Branches,</hi> which wou'd only create a Confuſion: They Strengthen other <hi>Branches</hi> that will be of uſe in the Sequel, by affording them the <hi>Sap,</hi> which wou'd be waſted on thoſe ſcurvy ones that can never be of any uſe, and muſt of Courſe be taken away the Winter following. It likewiſe contributes towards the Beauty and Goodneſs of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and ſerves to keep a <hi>Tree</hi> equally well furniſh'd; ſo that, by that means, ſeldom, or never, any Defects wou'd appear upon any of thoſe <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> unleſs they were perſecuted by that curſed <hi>Gum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Conſequences of thoſe kind of <hi>Branches,</hi> upon which the above-mention'd <hi>Prunings</hi> are perform'd. I deſire all <hi>Gard'ners</hi> to follow this Diſcuſſion exactly.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Branches,</hi> which I have a particular regard for, in relation to <hi>Fruit,</hi> ſhall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd one of theſe ſix things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> They may either have produc'd, almoſt in their whole Extent, a great deal of <hi>Fruit</hi> and fine <hi>Branches,</hi> or much <hi>Fruit</hi> and ugly <hi>Branches.</hi> By fine <hi>Branches</hi> here, I mean, ſuch as are thick enough to prove <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> the following Year, and in the mean time bear abundance of fine <hi>Leaves:</hi> And, on the contrary, I call thoſe poor and ugly, that are ſhort and ſlender, and are incapable of bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> only producing ſmall <hi>Leaves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> may chance only to have born <hi>Fruit</hi> upon part of their Length; for Example, the fourth part, third, or half, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to have ſhot either fine or ugly <hi>Branches</hi> every where, or in ſome part; and all this, perchance, towards the upper end, and ſometimes towards the lower.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They may chance to have produc'd no <hi>Fruit,</hi> but abundance of fine <hi>Branches;</hi> or many altogether ugly and uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They may only have produc'd a ſingle <hi>Branch</hi> on the Extremity, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Fruit</hi> every where, or without any <hi>Fruit</hi> any where.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They may only have produc'd one ſingle <hi>Fruit</hi> on the Extremity, with ſome <hi>Branches</hi> in part of their Extent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They may be kill'd with <hi>Gum</hi> or Cold in their whole Extent, or only towards the Extremity.</p>
                        <p>I have had the Experience of all theſe Caſes ſeveral times, in all which I have held the following Method.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt part of the firſt Caſe, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branches</hi> ſhall have produc'd <hi>Fruit</hi> and fine <hi>Branches</hi> in the beſt part of their Extent, we may rejoice at the Abundance; for, without doubt, all will go well, ſince the Appearances are ſo fair as far as the Month of <hi>May:</hi> Some of the <hi>Fruit</hi> only muſt be taken away, where it lies ſo cloſe, that we may have cauſe to believe that, in growing, they might obſtruct each other; for that wou'd ſpoil it: And likewiſe, in caſe any Confuſion be threaten'd by that Multitude of new <hi>Branches,</hi> ſome of the meaneſt, and worſt plac'd, may be remov'd. It is always to be wiſh'd, that the Lot of being retrench'd may fall upon the fartheſt.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Part of the firſt Caſe, in which the <hi>Branch</hi> has produc'd a great deal of <hi>Fruit,</hi> but no fine <hi>Branches;</hi> on the contrary, all weak and uſeleſs; the beſt part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> muſt be taken away, ſince it wou'd neither grow beautiful nor good; only ſome of that which looks beſt, and is beſt plac'd, may be preſerv'd; that is, that which grows in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48210:160"/>
the loweſt part of the <hi>Branch.</hi> At the ſame time the ſaid <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be very much ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, to reduce it to the ſecond or third <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> of the bottom, in order to ſtrengthen ſome of the beſt <hi>Branches</hi> that are upon it, for the next Year.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Caſe, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> only produces <hi>Fruit</hi> upon part of its Length, if the <hi>Fruit</hi> be grown upon the lower part of it, the <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be preſerv'd, and ſhorten'd cloſe to that, among the new ones, which appears fineſt, and neareſt to that <hi>Fruit;</hi> it is enough when there remains one or two paſſable good ones.</p>
                        <p>In caſe the <hi>Fruit</hi> be pretty abundant, and towards the upper Extremity, that having likewiſe pretty fine <hi>Branches,</hi> that <hi>Fruit</hi> muſt likewiſe be preſerv'd, and all the uſeleſs <hi>Branches</hi> remov'd, in the manner aboveſaid; only preſerving one or two of thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the fineſt, whatever part they be in, eſpecially being in the lower part, where we are always deſirous of them; for, as to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> 'tis always well plac'd, where-ever it be, even at the end of the <hi>Branches;</hi> provided always, that in preſerving one or two fine <hi>Branches</hi> on the Extremity of a <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> that has been kept of a great length, you muſt reſolve the following Year to retrench both the Mother and Daughter, or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, otherwiſe one part wou'd grow too thin.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt part of the third Caſe, in which the <hi>Branch</hi> has really produc'd no <hi>Fruit,</hi> but, to make amends, has ſhot a great many fine new <hi>Branches;</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, I ſay, it is fit, as much as can be, to preſerve the beſt of thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> being careful of not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any of them grow ſtronger than the other, eſpecially towards the Extremity, for ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> wou'd ruin all the lower; therefore ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> muſt be wholly taken away, and <hi>Pinch'd</hi> or broken within two or three <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> as we have heretofore explain'd.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Part of that third Caſe, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> has neither been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in <hi>Fruit,</hi> nor in <hi>Wood</hi> of a favourable Growth, you muſt wholly ſhorten ſuch a <hi>Branch,</hi> to a ſingle one of thoſe it has produc'd; and chuſe the loweſt, in hopes to ſtrengthen it, to make it good for the next Year, or take it quite away, it not anſwering our Intentions.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Part of the Fourth Caſe, in which the <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> has only produc'd a ſingle <hi>Branch</hi> on the Extremity, with abundance of <hi>Fruit</hi> every where, I am of Opinion that ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhou'd be preſerv'd, provided it does not incline to become a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> in which caſe it muſt be broken pretty ſhort: So that, in caſe ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> be but moderately thick, it promiſes much for the following Year; and as for all the little dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive <hi>Branches,</hi> that grow among the <hi>Fruit</hi> it bears, we <hi>Prune</hi> them, as we have declar'd in the Expoſition of the ſecond Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Therefore there is yet more reaſon to uſe all the little <hi>Branches</hi> we meet with here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Fruit</hi> in the Extent of the <hi>Branch</hi> in debate in the ſame manner, being certain that, for the generality, they <hi>ſhoot</hi> no more, being all at a ſtand in the Month of <hi>June:</hi> So that all our Comfort for the following Year lies in the fine <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> that offers it ſelf here, on the Extremity of the <hi>Branch</hi> that has bloſſom'd to no purpoſe in all its Extent.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth Caſe, in which the <hi>Branch</hi> that was left long, to bear a great deal of <hi>Fruit,</hi> has yet been ſo unfortunate, or abus'd, as not to have retain'd above one or two on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of it, and yet has ſhot ſome <hi>Branches</hi> in part of its Extent.</p>
                        <p>Several particular Regards muſt be had in this Caſe: For Example, If the <hi>Tree,</hi> on the other hand, has but little <hi>Fruit,</hi> for that being one will be tempted, and that with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to preſerve that which is known to be good, in ſuch a Caſe it will be proper not to meddle with ſuch a <hi>Branch;</hi> or elſe, to obſerve whether the <hi>Tree</hi> has produc'd a great deal of <hi>Fruit</hi> in the main; in which Caſe, no great difficulty muſt be made of loſing ſo little, and conſequently, of <hi>Pruning</hi> ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> again ſhort, in order to ſtrengthen ſome other that appears pretty good, and is well plac'd; which we may ſtand in need of for the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and for the hopes of future Years.</p>
                        <p>It will likewiſe be proper to conſider whether the Year be univerſally barren, which wou'd hinder the Operation I have been adviſing; or whether it be a doubtful <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which, it wou'd be neceſſary to know the kind, either to ſuppreſs, or multiply it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Caſe, it will be fit to preſerve this ſingle <hi>Peach,</hi> or thoſe two <hi>Peaches,</hi> that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on the top of the <hi>Branch</hi> in queſtion, though with ſome Regret, out of a juſt fear of a future Deformity in that <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For, in fine, the principal thing to be done in the Management of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> is, to prefer the Beauty of the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> in hopes of a future Abundance; I ſay, to prefer the Beauty of that <hi>Tree</hi> to a ſmall quantity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> though really preſent.</p>
                        <p>In fine, In the ſixth Caſe, in which the <hi>Branches</hi> are deſtroy'd by <hi>Gum,</hi> or Cold, it is neither difficult to give a good Advice, or to take it; for you muſt wholly take away all that is dead, and conſequently uſeleſs, and diſagreeable to Sight, in any part whatever, particularly on the Extremity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48210:160"/>
This is my Method for the Second <hi>Pruning.</hi> If any thing has hinder'd the performing of it about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> it may be done until the middle of <hi>June;</hi> ſo that even a Third may be perform'd at that time, when on the Second of the middle of <hi>May,</hi> it has been thought fit to venture ſtill ſome Lengths of <hi>Branches,</hi> and ſome <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe an Effect of the Second <hi>Pruning,</hi> to cut all the ſmall, ſapleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> that grow within the compaſs of the ſine one, which has been produc'd that very Year; as alſo, to ſhorten, in <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> that are weak, and at a ſtand.</p>
                        <p>I add, that the performing of ſuch an Operation is very material, but that unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is hardly practis'd at all, or, at leaſt, ſo ſeldom, either out of Lazineſs, or for want of time; the <hi>Gardner</hi> having, perhaps, too great a number of <hi>Trees,</hi> and other Works, that overwhelm him.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Obſerve, among <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> three different Methods of Ordering all manner of <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> in the Summer, in relation to the young <hi>Branches</hi> they produce. The Firſt tear or pull off indifferently all thoſe that grow before and behind, and leave but few others: Thoſe ſeem to me extreamly to blame, and unworthy the Profeſſion they follow.</p>
                        <p>The Second cut all thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> within three or four <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> and by that means occaſion abundance of <hi>Fruz,</hi> among which there ſometimes grows a little <hi>Fruit,</hi> but that is pretty rare: Beſides that, this Method renders the <hi>Trees</hi> ugly, and diſagreeable; and therefore I diſapprove it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The Third preſerve in the Summer all the good <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>Palliſado</hi> them neatly; tarrying to chuſe the beſt until the Seaſon of <hi>Pruning:</hi> Thoſe, in my Opinion, are in the right, and I imitate them as much as I can.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WHereas <hi>Pruning</hi> only ſerves barely to ſhorten, or wholly to take away ſome old <hi>Branches,</hi> that, either by their length, ſituation, or number, annoy a <hi>Tree;</hi> ſo this <hi>Triming</hi> or <hi>Picking,</hi> is only to deſtroy, and entirely remove young <hi>Branches</hi> of the Year, either thick, or ſmall, growing improperly, and capable of cauſing a Confuſion, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing either the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> or only the <hi>Branch</hi> on which they are grown.</p>
                        <p>The Time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> as we have declar'd, is from <hi>November,</hi> to the End of <hi>March;</hi> which <hi>Pruning</hi> muſt be perform'd regularly every Year; whereas the Time of the <hi>Triming</hi> is commonly about <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſometimes it is not done at all; but when there is Cauſe for it, it muſt not be neglected; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it cannot be done too ſoon, to prevent the Growth of thoſe uſeleſs <hi>Shoots,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the waſting a great deal of <hi>Sap</hi> unprofitably, which might be employ'd to better Uſes: So that when it has been neglected, or not perform'd ſoon enough, it muſt be done late, if poſſible, ſince it is better to do a neceſſary thing late than never.</p>
                        <p>It is not eaſie to ſet down preciſely what <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be ſo <hi>Prun'd,</hi> or <hi>Trim'd,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to ſatisfie thoſe, among the Curious, who know but little, and are only Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: But a skilful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who, by the Rules heretofore eſtabliſh'd, has form'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Idea</hi> of a fine <hi>Tree,</hi> and conſequently muſt know partly what <hi>Branches</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, as well for the Beauty of the Figure, as for <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſuch a <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> I ſay, muſt needs, at firſt ſight, know thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> that are no ways anſwerable to the <hi>Idea</hi> he has conceiv'd, and conſequently take them away at their very Birth, or at leaſt from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he perceives them, eſpecially before the End of Summer; that is, before the <hi>Trees</hi> have made an end of <hi>ſhooting,</hi> or that ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> are grown thick; otherwiſe they muſt remain until the time of <hi>Pruning:</hi> But, generally ſpeaking, I may ſay, that this <hi>Triming</hi> or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48210:161"/>
                           <hi>Picking,</hi> is to retrench or take off all ill-plac'd <hi>Branches ſhooting</hi> from any part whatever, whether good or bad: eſpecially ſuch as cauſe a Confuſion, without being proper either for <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Fruit.</hi> The Knowledge of the Order in which the <hi>Branches</hi> grow, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or ill, which we have clearly explain'd at the beginning of this Treatiſe, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> muſt particularly be look'd to, from the very Beginning of <hi>April,</hi> to the End, that if, from a ſlanting <hi>Cut,</hi> which was to produce a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> outwardly, there ſhould grow a thick one inwardly, it may be taken away immediately, in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the two Reaſons which ordain <hi>Trimming.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe neceſſary to take away the <hi>Branches</hi> which hinder others that are better plac'd, and ſhould be more uſeful, from receiving a due Nouriſhment; For Example, Take away high <hi>Branches,</hi> to favour low ones; by which means they would grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; whereas without ſuch a help, they would remain uprofitable, and the <hi>Tree</hi> would ſuffer, both as to the Figure, and the <hi>Fruit</hi> we expect from it.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Trimming</hi> or <hi>Pruning,</hi> is perform'd upon young <hi>Trees,</hi> as well as old ones; and therefore, when a young <hi>Tree</hi> at once <hi>ſhoots</hi> high and low <hi>Branches,</hi> with a great Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or ſpace between them, it is proper to take away the higheſt, when the loweſt are deſign'd to be preſerv'd; or elſe the loweſt, when the others deſerve it better: Which is not only to be done by way of <hi>Trimming,</hi> but alſo by the real way of <hi>Pruning,</hi> that is, with the <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> when the bare <hi>Trimming</hi> or <hi>Nipping</hi> is not ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>If, upon any <hi>Tree</hi> whatever, one and the ſame <hi>Eye</hi> produces two or three <hi>Branches,</hi> ſome of them muſt be taken away by way of <hi>Nipping off,</hi> to better the Condition of the others, as well as to avoid Confuſion.</p>
                        <p>So that upon a weak <hi>Branch,</hi> which, from one <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud, ſhoots,</hi> for inſtance, two or three, and all probably weak, I will only preſerve one, chuſing that which appears to be the beſt, that is, the thickeſt.</p>
                        <p>But if, on the contrary, a very vigorous <hi>Branch ſhoots</hi> three from one and the ſame <hi>Eye,</hi> and that the middlemoſt appears too ſtrong, and the worſt plac'd, I ſhall, without doubt, take it away, to ſtrengthen the two others a little; which may afterwards, the one on one ſide, and the other on the other, prove very ſerviceable to the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So upon very vigorous <hi>Trees,</hi> it is neceſſary, at the <hi>Nipping off</hi> or <hi>Trimming,</hi> to take away ſome of the ſtrongeſt <hi>Branches,</hi> always preſerving ſuch as are ſomewhat leſs, provided they ſeem to be good; and eſpecially, when the thick <hi>Branch</hi> that has been <hi>Prun'd ſhoots</hi> many, whence Confuſion proceeds, the higheſt muſt be taken away, taking Care however not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen thoſe kind of <hi>Trees</hi> too much, which, by reaſon of their great Vigour, hardly produce any other but thick <hi>Branches;</hi> whereas, on the contrary, upon <hi>Trees</hi> that have not much Vigour, all the ſlendereſt and pooreſt muſt be taken off, in order to ſtrengthen thoſe that appear ſtronger, and yet are not ſo ſtrong as they ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>From thence it is eaſie to conclude, that ſome <hi>Trees</hi> may as well be prejudic'd by <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off</hi> of them too much, as others by not being <hi>Nipp'd off</hi> enough: The <hi>Gard'ner</hi>'s Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe whoſe great Vigour requires one kind of <hi>Nipping off,</hi> or <hi>Trimming,</hi> and thoſe whoſe Weakneſs requires another.</p>
                        <p>I will ſay by the by, that if it be judg'd that many <hi>Cyons</hi> may be requir'd to <hi>Graff Scutcheon-wiſe,</hi> it will be fit to be ſomewhat more cautious in the <hi>Nipping off</hi> of vigorous <hi>Trees,</hi> which may furniſh <hi>Graffs;</hi> ſtill taking Care that it may not prejudice the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the following Year.</p>
                        <p>It happens pretty often, that for want of having <hi>Nipp'd off,</hi> or <hi>Palliſado'd</hi> prudently, we ſee that, in the Confuſion of <hi>Branches,</hi> ſome long ſlender ones <hi>ſhoot</hi> out; which muſt be carefully taken away at the Seaſon of <hi>Pruning,</hi> or, at leaſt, ſhorten'd to an <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> being commonly naught.</p>
                        <p>It likewiſe commonly happens, that the <hi>Branch</hi> of a <hi>Peach-Tree ſhoots</hi> others in the very Summer, which has produc'd it, in which Caſe it muſt be examin'd and (if very poor) <hi>Nipp'd off,</hi> or taken away, in any part whatever: But if of a good thickneſs, having dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> ſo as to be fit to make a <hi>Fruit-Branch,</hi> it muſt be carefully preſerv'd, though only grown in <hi>July.</hi> And if the lower part of ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhould produce one of a reaſonable thickneſs, ſo as to be proper for a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> it muſt be look'd upon as a very good Omen for the Beauty and Preſervation of the <hi>Tree:</hi> But if, on the contrary, the upper part of ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhould <hi>ſhoot</hi> any which ſhould grow ſo thick as to be only fit for a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> it muſt be taken away, as being in a place where we have no occaſion for a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> beſides, it would prejudice the Mother that produc'd it.</p>
                        <p>It is not much to be queſtion'd, but that, as in <hi>Pruning</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> while in <hi>Sap,</hi> we viſibly loſe a great deal of <hi>Sap</hi> through the part ſo <hi>Prun'd,</hi> ſo in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Sap</hi>

evaporates, or is waſted through the place that is cut at the time of <hi>Shooting,</hi> which is in the Summer.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe obſerv'd in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Melons,</hi> that a <hi>Branch,</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> produces more new ones than that which was left <hi>Unprun'd;</hi> and therefore I adviſe the <hi>Pruning</hi> of too vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> late: For it is obſervable in <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> that a thick, young <hi>Branch,</hi> having been cut in the Summer-time, ſeldom <hi>ſhoots</hi> afterwards, or, at leaſt, very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably, inſomuch that the end of it blackens and dies; the Conſequence of which is, that the neighbouring <hi>Branches</hi> thereby commonly grow the more vigorous. But, indeed, neither this <hi>Nipping off,</hi> nor the <hi>Pinching,</hi> or <hi>Breaking,</hi> do waſte <hi>Sap</hi> at this rate; and are ſo far from being dangerous Operations to be perform'd in the Summer, as is the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> with a <hi>Knife,</hi> that they are very uſeful, and often very neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Though this <hi>Nipping off</hi> properly relates only to the removing of <hi>Buds,</hi> it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be underſtood for the <hi>Plucking off</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> when there is too much in one place; this <hi>Plucking off</hi> being perform'd at the ſame time with the <hi>Nipping off:</hi> Which Matter I treat of at large in another place, and ſo ſhall ſay no more of it here.</p>
                        <p>When any <hi>Branch</hi> (which ſeem'd to be good at the time of <hi>Pruning</hi> it, and therefore was preſerv'd) grows poor, for want of a good Supply of new <hi>Sap,</hi> which happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by an inward Diſorder, which could not be prevented; in ſuch a Caſe, there is no other Remedy, than the taking away of ſuch a <hi>Branch,</hi> as ſoon as perceiv'd. Sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome uſeleſs <hi>Branches</hi> may have been left by Negligence, or want of Application; which muſt likewiſe be remov'd, as ſoon as obſerv'd: And ſuppoſing ſome fine <hi>Fruit</hi> may be left on the Extremity of a <hi>Branch</hi> that has produc'd no new <hi>Wood,</hi> which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in that Caſe the <hi>Branch</hi> muſt not be taken off until the <hi>Fruit</hi> be gather'd; after which, it muſt be remov'd, ſince it could never be good for any thing.</p>

                           <hi>PInching,</hi> in relation to <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> is, to break deſignedly a tender <hi>Sprig</hi> of any <hi>Plant</hi> whatever, and that without the help of any Inſtrument, only uſing the Nails of two Fingers.

                           </gap>it to make uſe of it, though only upon four kind of <hi>Fruit-Trees, viz. Pear, Peach, Fig,</hi> and <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> and I ſhall only treat here of what relates to the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> of vigorous <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and the thick new <hi>Branches ſhooting</hi> from ſlit <hi>Graffs</hi> made upon old <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> being ſtill in a pretty good Caſe: I will treat in other places of what relates to the <hi>Pinching</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> and even of <hi>Strawberry-Plants,</hi> and <hi>Raddiſhes</hi> run up to <hi>Seed, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Reaſon which made me imagine this way of <hi>Pinching</hi> theſe two ſorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> and that makes me uſe it pretty often, is, that it being moſt certain that <hi>Fruit</hi> ſeldom grows upon thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and commonly upon the weak ones, I thought, if it were poſſible to order Matters ſo, that the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is wholly employ'd in producing but one thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which proves either uſeleſs, or cumberſom; I ſay, if it could be order'd ſo, that this <hi>Sap</hi> might be ſo divided as to produce ſeveral <hi>Branches,</hi> there is no Queſtion to be made, but in the Quantity there would be ſome weak ones, or perhaps many, which conſequently would be proper to bear <hi>Fruit</hi> inſtead of that, and, as we have already ſaid, the thick <hi>Branch</hi> would have produc'd no good Effect.</p>
                        <p>I have found the thing poſſible, and that it is requir'd, not only in <hi>May,</hi> but ſometimes in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> to break the thick new <hi>Shoots</hi> of thoſe kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> while yet tender, and as eaſie to break as Glaſs; which is moſt true.</p>
                        <p>This Operation is founded upon a Reaſon which I have explain'd in my Reflections, and therefore is not neceſſary here.</p>
                        <p>Having then, at the time heretofore mention'd, broken ſome of thoſe thick new <hi>Shoots</hi> within two or three <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> I have often obtain'd what I deſir'd by it, that is, as many <hi>Branches</hi> as I had left <hi>Eyes;</hi> and, indeed, a vigorous <hi>Tree</hi> cannot have too many,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48210:162"/>
provided they be good, and well plac'd. Among the <hi>Branches</hi> proceeding from ſuch <hi>Pinching,</hi> if I may uſe the Expreſſion, commonly ſome have prov'd weak, and thoſe have born <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſome have prov'd pretty ſtrong, and have been <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood:</hi> If the <hi>Sap,</hi> which produc'd ſuch thick <hi>Branches,</hi> and form'd them with a lively, vigorous Action, met in its way an Obſtacle, to ſtop it ſhort in the heighth of its Action, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently hindring it from following its Courſe in continuing to riſe, as it would do, not being hinder'd; in ſuch a Caſe, this <hi>Sap,</hi> which, in the mean time, cannot ceaſe acting, being forc'd to get out one way or other, would burſt out by as many Cranies, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as it would find near that place where it was ſtop'd; or, upon neceſſity, would make ſome of it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>But it muſt be noted, that this <hi>Pinching</hi> is ſeldom to be practis'd upon any but the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the Top, which would remain uſeleſs by their Situation, and yet would conſume abundance of good <hi>Sap</hi> ſuperfluouſly; and therefore it ought to be very ſeldom us'd upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the lower part, it being always very neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them until the Winter-<hi>Pruning,</hi> in order to their <hi>ſhooting</hi> ſome others the following Year, ſit to fill ſuch places as naturally, and for the moſt part, are but too ſubject to be thin.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe to be obſerv'd, that this <hi>Pinching,</hi> or Breaking off, muſt never be perform'd upon weak <hi>Branches;</hi> which, having no more <hi>Sap</hi> than they want, to be good, would only produce ſlender, <hi>Sapleſs</hi> ones in that place, where the ſmall Portion of <hi>Sap</hi> which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allows them ſhould be divided.</p>
                        <p>And therefore nothing muſt be broken upon ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> as produce but too many of thoſe weak <hi>Branches,</hi> and few of thoſe good thick ones: There are ſome of this Character to be found among all kind of <hi>Peach-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The beſt time for <hi>Pinching,</hi> particularly in cold Climes, like ours of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Neighbourhood of it, as we have already ſaid, is, at the End of <hi>May,</hi> and the Beginning of <hi>June;</hi> and when neceſſary to be perform'd a ſecond time, the time of the <hi>Solſtice,</hi> or longeſt Days of the Year, is admirable for it, as well as to <hi>Water</hi> ſome <hi>Trees</hi> in a dry Soil, when <hi>Rain</hi> is wanting; at which time there is a wonderful re-doubling of Action in the <hi>Roots,</hi> and conſequently in the <hi>Branches;</hi> that being, indeed, the time of the greateſt Effort of all the Spring.</p>
                        <p>We have already obſerv'd, that the firſt Fury of <hi>Stone-Fruits</hi> begins to appear at the Full-Moon of <hi>April,</hi> which commonly falls out in <hi>May;</hi> and we are going to ſee another kind of Fury at the Firſt Quarter of the Moon of the ſaid Month of <hi>May;</hi> both which times are good for <hi>Pinching:</hi> And, indeed, we obſerve, that all the <hi>Branches</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> do not begin to <hi>ſhoot</hi> vigorouſly at the ſame time; ſo that what has not been <hi>Pinch'd</hi> or broken off at the firſt Seaſon, may be done at the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid, that the beſt time to <hi>Pinch</hi> the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> was, at the time they are eaſie to break at the leaſt pull, without being oblig'd to uſe a <hi>Knife</hi> to ſhorten them: From thence it is eaſie to judge, that I have found it dangerous to uſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to cut ſuch <hi>Branches,</hi> which is true; for, as I have ſaid heretofore, the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or End of ſuch <hi>Branches</hi> ſo cut, is apt to blacken and die, it certainly not producing the ſame Effect with that which proceeds from the Action of <hi>Pinching.</hi> The ſame thing may be ſaid of the thick, tender <hi>Branches,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Graff's</hi> of <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> made upon a thick, vigorous <hi>Stock;</hi> however, Experience teaches us, that the <hi>Knife</hi> is not ſo dangerous upon theſe, as upon thoſe of <hi>Peach-Trees.</hi>

                        <p>As to the very vigorous <hi>Tree,</hi> particularly in queſtion here, many People propoſe, as ſoveraign and infallible, abundance of Expedients and Remedies, which I have tried a long while, with great Application; yet, upon my Word, without the leaſt Succeſs.</p>

                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48210:162"/>
To bore a Hole through the <hi>Stem</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> and put a Peg of dry Oak into it; to ſplit one of the main <hi>Roots,</hi> and put a Stone into it; to <hi>Prune</hi> at the time of the Declinings of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are wretched Secrets of good old People, infatuated with old Maxims; People who have but little Skill in Vegetation, and are eaſily ſatisfy'd.</p>
                        <p>For my part, beſides my being perſuaded by Experience, that my manner of <hi>Pruning</hi> often prevents the Difficulty now in queſtion, I have moreover, in caſe of great Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, recourſe to what I have ſaid elſewhere, it being really the beſt thing that can be done; which is, that, as conſtantly the <hi>Fruit</hi> on <hi>Trees,</hi> is only an Effect, or, at leaſt, a Mark of a certain moderate Weakneſs, it is neceſſary, without minding a thouſand Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, to go to the Source of the Vigour of the <hi>Tree,</hi> that is, to the <hi>Roots,</hi> uncovering half of them, and cutting off one, two, or three of the thickeſt on that ſide, and conſequently the moſt active; inſomuch that the leaſt part of them may not remain, to be capable of acting, or producing the leaſt <hi>Thread</hi> of a capilar <hi>Root:</hi> The <hi>Roots</hi> of the other Moity, (for I ſuppoſe there may be good ones; otherwiſe, ſo many muſt not be taken away from the Side uncovered;) the <hi>Roots,</hi> I ſay, of the other Moity, left untouch'd, will be ſufficient to nouriſh the whole <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Remedy is infallible to prevent ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> from being, as it were, reſty to our Cares and Induſtry, and will ſoon make them produce <hi>Fruit;</hi> by reaſon that this will put a ſtop to the Production of the <hi>Sap,</hi> ſo that it ſhall not be ſo abounding as before, one, two, or three of the chief Workers being remov'd; and thus the weak <hi>Branches</hi> will only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a moderate Nouriſhment, and the <hi>Buds</hi> begun, inſtead of extending, will grow round, and conſequently turn to <hi>Fruit-Buds,</hi> will <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> and finally yield what is deſired of them.</p>

                        <p>Before I enter upon this matter, I cannot forbear expreſſing my Aſtoniſhment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that notwithſtanding the ſingular Eſteem moſt People have for good <hi>Figs,</hi> it was a general Cuſtom in this Country to have but a very ſmall quantity of them in each <hi>Garden,</hi> not exceeding two or three at moſt, and even thoſe commonly abandon'd in ſome inner <hi>Yard,</hi> expos'd to all manner of ill Treatment, without the leaſt <hi>Culture.</hi> Indeed, in warmer Climates they are better, and more honourably treated; there are always abundance of them, not only in <hi>Gardens,</hi> and under the ſhelter of a Houſe, but particularly in <hi>Vine-yards,</hi> in <hi>Hedges,</hi> and in the open <hi>Fields;</hi> and they make a conſiderable Trade of thoſe that are preſerv'd, and dry'd, which I do not mention here.</p>
                        <p>I am ſenſible, that the difficulty of preſerving <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> from the great Colds of the Winter, is the chief Reaſon for which we have ſo few of them in our Climates; but yet, conſidering the Conſequence and Merit of their <hi>Fruit,</hi> in my Opinion, People ſhould have made it their Study, a little more than they have done, to enjoy, to a higher degree, that rich Preſent of Nature.</p>
                        <p>It is not neceſſary to repeat here what I have ſaid at large in the Treatiſe of the Choice and Proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> touching the Diverſity of the Kinds of <hi>Figs,</hi> nor of my prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the white ones, whether long, or round, for this Country, to all the others: Neither will I repeat what I have ſaid, as to the Situation which is moſt proper for them.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall only relate the manner of my <hi>Cultivating</hi> of them; and eſpecially, how that, notwithſtanding the ill Cuſtom, which made us be ſatisfy'd with a few of them, I have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48210:163"/>
apply'd my ſelf to the breeding of many; and that not only by the common Way of <hi>Planting</hi> them in <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> or againſt Walls, but alſo in an extraordinary manner, that is, in <hi>Caſes,</hi> which is both pretty new, pleaſant and uſeful; which, if I may be allow'd to introduce a new Expreſſion, may be call'd a <hi>Figuerie,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Orangeries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Delight His Majeſty takes in that <hi>Fruit,</hi> and the danger of Dying, to which all <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are expos'd in the open <hi>Ground,</hi> in great Froſts, or, at leaſt, of bearing no <hi>Fruit</hi> that Year, have been two powerful Motives for me, who am honour'd with the Place of Director of all the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> belonging to the Royal Family, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to bethink my ſelf of the Means of Certainly having a great many <hi>Figs</hi> every Year.</p>
                        <p>In the performance of which, I have met with very little difficulty; for, in the firſt place, the common <hi>Mould</hi> of every <hi>Garden,</hi> mix'd with an equal quantity of <hi>Soil</hi> or ſmall <hi>Dung,</hi> turn'd to <hi>Mould,</hi> is extraordinary good for it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> inſtead of being hard and thick, like thoſe of other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Kernel,</hi> on the contrary, remain ſoft and flexible, and commonly ſlender, and ſo are eaſily order'd in <hi>Caſes,</hi> and even with more caſe than thoſe of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which thrive ſo well in them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe kind of <hi>Trees</hi> naturally produce abundance of <hi>Roots;</hi> ſo that it is very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for them to live fatly and vigorouſly in a ſmall quantity or ſpace of <hi>Ground,</hi> provided Moiſture be not wanting. Beſides, the univerſal Approbation I have met with in this Undertaking, and the Imitation that has follow'd it by many of the Curious, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd me to make a conſiderable progreſs in this <hi>Figuerie,</hi> or <hi>Fig-Garden;</hi> and that which has moſt induc'd me to proceed in it, is, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> ripens a great deal ſooner here than in the main <hi>Ground,</hi> and is ſomewhat better, and yellower, the <hi>Earth</hi> which is eaſily heated in the <hi>Caſes,</hi> producing the firſt good Effect, and the open Air the two others.</p>
                        <p>To which I might add, the pleaſure of ſeeing in this Country abundance of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in the open Air, (which ſeem'd to be altogether reſerv'd for hot Countries,) and that of being, in the Summer, in the middle of a <hi>Wood,</hi> abounding with <hi>Figs;</hi> there to chuſe and gather the ſineſt and ripeſt, without any trouble.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I have bred abundance of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>Caſes,</hi> having found that, beſides the Advantages above related, there was yet another which is very conſiderable; and that is, that, to preſerve them ſecurely, and with Eaſe, in the Winter, an ordinary Covering to keep off the great Froſt is ſufficient, that Covering or Shelter not being near ſo conſiderable as thoſe for <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> and <hi>Jeſſemins,</hi> theſe both ſtripping or caſting their <hi>Leaves</hi> at the leaſt Cold, by which they are almoſt utterly ſpoil'd; every body knowing, that a Fall of <hi>Leaves,</hi> proceeding from the Rigour of Cold, or too much Moiſture, denotes, in thoſe <hi>Trees,</hi> at leaſt, a great Infirmity in the <hi>Branches</hi> ſo ſtripp'd, inſomuch that it is almoſt impoſſible to recover them; whereas we have no <hi>Leaves</hi> to preſerve on our <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> it is only <hi>Wood,</hi> I mean <hi>Branches,</hi> of which the <hi>Wood</hi> is pretty courſe, though extreamly <hi>Pithy,</hi> or <hi>Sappy;</hi> inſomuch, that it reſiſts the Cold much better than <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> it being certain that this <hi>Wood,</hi> which of it ſelf is pretty tender, notwithſtanding, dries up at the uſual Fall of the Leaves, and conſequently grows hard; the reaſon of which is, that the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ceaſing to act within, from the time the <hi>Leaves</hi> begin to fall on the out-ſide, the <hi>Wood</hi> no longer receiving any new <hi>Sap,</hi> ceaſes to fear the Rigour of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; whereas the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> and <hi>Jeſſamins,</hi> by the perpetual Operation of their <hi>Roots,</hi> remains as tender in the Winter as it is all the reſt of the Year: Which is the reaſon that, as the <hi>Sap</hi> continually riſes, particularly for the Nouriſhment of thoſe <hi>Leaves</hi> that remain upon the <hi>Branches,</hi> as well as for the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Branches</hi> themſelves; that <hi>Sap,</hi> at that time, as it were, keeps both the one and the other ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to Froſt and Moiſture, that thereby they often fall into thoſe great Diſorders, known by every body, which are almoſt the greateſt they are liable to.</p>
                        <p>It being then granted, that, for the preſervation of our <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> it is ſufficient that the great Froſt ſhould not light directly upon their <hi>Branches,</hi> it follows from thence, that it is ſufficient for the <hi>Conſervatory</hi> to be reaſonably cloſe, as well at the top, as at the Doors and Windows; inſomuch that the <hi>Ground</hi> may have been pretty well frozen in the <hi>Caſes,</hi> and yet the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> receive no prejudice by it: So that a moderate low Cellar, or a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or a Common-Hall, which would be ſo pernicious to <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> and <hi>Jeſſemins,</hi> may not be amiſs for our <hi>Fig-Trees;</hi> not but if that place were very moiſt, it might harm them: As alſo a <hi>Cas'd Fig-Tree,</hi> remaining in the Winter without a Covering, would be much more endanger'd than another in the main <hi>Ground;</hi> for a thick Froſt would kill the <hi>Roots,</hi> as well as the Head; whereas a <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> planted in open <hi>Ground,</hi> would, at leaſt, be preſerv'd towards the <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Time of putting <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in the <hi>Conſervatories,</hi> is the Month of <hi>November;</hi> that is, they muſt be plac'd there as ſoon as the thick or great Froſts are coming on, there to re|
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48210:163"/>
without wanting the leaſt Culture, or any Care, beſides the keeping of the place as cloſe as can be, and that only during the great Colds; for, excepting that time, they need not be kept ſo cloſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They may be taken out again about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> and ſometimes at the very beginning, the Weather being very fair, and the Seaſons of great Froſts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſome manner, paſt: There is no need of ſtaying, till there is nothing at all to fear, for the new <hi>Figs;</hi> for then there would be a neceſſity of ſtaying until the end of <hi>April;</hi> it happening pretty often, that, until that time, there are certain Froſts, which blacken and kill them, though reaſonably thick. The reaſon which obliges to take them out ſooner, is, that it is neceſſary <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ſhould immediately enjoy the Rays of the Sun, and ſome ſoft Showers of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> in order to be able to <hi>ſhoot</hi> their firſt <hi>Fruit</hi> with ſucceſs, to the end, above all things, that thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> may inſenſibly be us'd to the open Air; which muſt make them grow, and ripen betimes; it being moſt certain, that the <hi>Figs</hi> which grow under Covert, coming into the open Air, are apt to blacken, and ſo periſh, even without any Froſt, or conſiderable Cold; a North-Eaſt Wind, or exceſſive Heat, in the firſt Days of their coming out, deſtroying them without Redemption: Whereas thoſe <hi>Figs</hi> that have been a little enur'd to the Air, have harden'd themſelves ſo, as to be able to reſiſt, notwithſtanding the Intemperature of the Seaſon.</p>
                        <p>In taking the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> out of the <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> at the time prefix'd, there are only two things to be done: The firſt is, to put them immediately along, and as cloſe as can be to ſome good Walls, expos'd to the South or Eaſt; and there leave them, until the Full-Moon of <hi>April</hi> be paſt, which is about the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> This ſituation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary for them, to enjoy the Aſpect of the Father of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and be ſoak'd by the Rains of the Spring, as well as to find ſome Shelter againſt the Morning-Froſts of the Remains of Winter, which are thoſe of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> becauſe that, whereas this wonderful <hi>Fruit ſhoots</hi> out at that time, ready form'd, from the Body of the <hi>Branch;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it ſelf thus, all on the ſudden, without the help of any Covering, or being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> or <hi>Leaves,</hi> it muſt needs be very tender in the firſt Days of its Birth; and therefore ſuch Froſts, which are very common and frequent at thoſe times, falling then upon them, would prove very dangerous, or rather mortal; inſomuch that, though this Shelter be favourable to <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> both to ſuch that are <hi>planted</hi> in the <hi>Ground,</hi> as well as to thoſe that are in <hi>Caſes,</hi> yet, notwithſtanding, it is neceſſary to cover them with Sheets, or Straw, or long dry Dung, or <hi>Peas-Cods,</hi> when-ever they ſeem to be threaten'd by ſome Froſt: The cold North-Weſt Winds, North, and North-Eaſt, or ſome Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>The ſecond thing that is to be done, after having remov'd <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> out of the <hi>Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory,</hi> and having thus plac'd them under ſhelter, is, (to uſe the Phraſe of <hi>Gard'ners)</hi> to give them a good Wetting in every <hi>Caſe;</hi> which is, one good ſubſtantial Wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; inſomuch that all the Moat may be ſoak'd by it; and there ſhall hardly need any more <hi>Watering,</hi> until, with ſome <hi>Leaves,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> begins to appear all together, and even a little thick, which is about the middle of <hi>April;</hi> the Spring-Rains will ſupply other <hi>Waterings,</hi> but this firſt <hi>Watering</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary, to ſoak the <hi>Ground</hi> a-new, which, after four or five Months Confinement, was grown quite dry; otherwiſe the <hi>Roots,</hi> at the coming in of the hot Weather, ſhould not be capable, for want of Moiſture, to renew their Action; and conſequently, there ſhould be no good Motion of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> either to nouriſh and thicken that new <hi>Fruit</hi> the ſooner, or to afford us the ſooner <hi>Leaves,</hi> and new <hi>Wood;</hi> with a Certainty, that the ſooner <hi>Fig-Trees ſhoot</hi> in the Spring, the ſooner we ſhall have the ſecond <hi>Figs</hi> of Autumn. I will take notice by the by here, that the firſt <hi>Figs</hi> grow independently from the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> of other <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> open; and produce their firſt <hi>Buds</hi> independently, from the Action of their <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Cold, that is the great Enemy of thoſe <hi>Figs,</hi> being gone, which happens commonly about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Caſes</hi> muſt be remov'd from that Shelter, and put ſomewhat at large, to be in the open Air, eſpecially in ſome little <hi>Garden,</hi> well ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with good Walls; they may be diſpos'd ſo, as to border, or form Allies on both ſides, or elſe a little green <hi>Wood,</hi> as I do, when there are enough for it; which is that I call, and ought to be call'd, a <hi>Figuerie,</hi> or <hi>Fig-Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As ſoon as theſe <hi>Caſes</hi> are thus diſpos'd of, they muſt be allow'd another good <hi>Watering,</hi> the ſame to be continu'd once a Week, until the end of <hi>May;</hi> after which, they muſt be <hi>Water'd,</hi> at leaſt, twice a Week; and laſtly, towards the middle of <hi>June,</hi> they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great and frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> almoſt once a Day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48210:164"/>
But, before I come to this, in order to gain Time, and to get with eaſe a great many <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> for the Eſtabliſhment and Maintenance of my <hi>Fig-Garden,</hi> I begin by making, towards the middle of <hi>March,</hi> an ordinary <hi>Bed,</hi> or <hi>Colich,</hi> of good <hi>Dung,</hi> of about three Foot high, in proportion to four or five Foot in Breadth, and as much in Length as my Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires: I let the great Heat of it paſs, which commonly laſts five or ſix Days; after which, having provided <hi>Earthen Pots</hi> about five or ſix Inches Diameter, or ſmall <hi>Caſes</hi> about ſeven or eight: I fill thoſe <hi>Pots,</hi> or <hi>Caſes,</hi> with the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Garden,</hi> mix'd, as I have ſaid, with an equal quantity of <hi>Soil</hi> or ſmall, old, conſummated <hi>Dung,</hi> or with nothing elſe; that <hi>Soil</hi> being very good for the firſt Multiplication of <hi>Roots,</hi> but would not be ſo good for the other <hi>Caſings.</hi> Care muſt be taken to preſs that <hi>Earth</hi> very cloſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of the <hi>Pot,</hi> as well as in the bottom of the <hi>Caſe;</hi> it will ſuffice to have two or three Inches looſe on the top.</p>
                        <p>After this, I take ſmall <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> altogether <hi>Rooted,</hi> and after having extreamly ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd all their <hi>Roots,</hi> I put them, about three or four Inehes deep, into the ſaid <hi>Pots,</hi> or <hi>Caſes,</hi> allowing each but about four or five Inches <hi>Stem: (Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>Caſes</hi> cannot be too ſhort body'd:) Afterwards I put the ſaid <hi>Pots,</hi> or <hi>Caſes,</hi> up to the Middle in the aforeſaid <hi>Bed.</hi> A conſiderable part of thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> ſo <hi>Planted,</hi> commonly take, and produce, that very Year, ſome pretty fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> and in a pretty good number; provided, as is abſolutely neceſſary, they be well <hi>Water'd</hi> during the Summer, and that the <hi>Bed</hi> has been heated twice or thrice on the ſides, to keep it always reaſonably hot.</p>
                        <p>When I make uſe of <hi>Pots,</hi> I take out of the <hi>Pots,</hi> that very Summer, or, at leaſt, in Autumn, or the following Spring, thoſe little <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> that have <hi>ſhot</hi> well in thoſe <hi>Pots,</hi> to put them together, with the Mote into <hi>Caſes,</hi> of about ſeven or eight Inches, fill'd up with the prepar'd <hi>Earth;</hi> which, above all, as I have already ſaid, muſt have been preſs'd cloſe into the bottom, to hinder that Mote, and the new <hi>Roots</hi> that ſhall grow, from deſcending too ſoon, and too eaſily, into that Bottom; and to do it yet more effectually, in <hi>Caſing</hi> of them, I obſerve the ſame Method as in <hi>Caſing</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> excepting only <hi>Rubbiſh,</hi> and pieces of old and dry <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> which are no wiſe neceſſary here; that is, I <hi>Plant</hi> theſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Superficies of the Mote, may exceed the Edge of the <hi>Caſe</hi> about two or three Inches; and, with <hi>Douves</hi> put on the ſides, I keep in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> of the <hi>Waterings,</hi> ſo that none of it can be waſted; the weight of the <hi>Caſes,</hi> and eſpecially the frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> together with the moving or tranſporting of the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ſo <hi>Caſed</hi> ſinking the Surface but too ſoon.</p>
                        <p>Great Care being taken to <hi>Water</hi> thoſe young <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> in thoſe little <hi>Caſes,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin pretty often to produce <hi>Fruit</hi> in them the very Year of their being <hi>Cas'd;</hi> at leaſt, they are in a Condition to produce ſome the following Years. They muſt be kept two Years in thoſe kind of little <hi>Caſes,</hi> in order to be put next into larger, of about thirteen or fourteen Inches in the in-ſide; in order to which, two thirds of the Mote, muſt of neceſſity be taken away, <hi>Planting</hi> them eſpecially, as I have already ſaid, a little high, and preſſing the <hi>Ground,</hi> as cloſe as can be, into the Bottom: Which things muſt all be done of neceſſity, at every Removal out of the <hi>Caſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are to remain in theſe, until there be a neceſſity of changing them a-new: which muſt be done as ſoon as the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are obſerv'd to <hi>ſhoot</hi> no more thick <hi>Wood,</hi> which commonly happens at the end of the third or fourth Year after their being <hi>Cas'd:</hi> At which time they muſt be taken out of thoſe <hi>Cheſts,</hi> and, after having perform'd the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations heretofore explain'd, put again either into the ſame <hi>Caſes,</hi> if, after having ſerv'd three or four Years, they are ſtill good enough; which happens but ſeldom, the great <hi>Waterings</hi> rotting many of them; or into other new <hi>Caſes</hi> of the ſame Size.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> muſt be left three or four Years longer in thoſe kind of <hi>Caſes,</hi> being about thirteen or fourteen Inches in the in-ſide; and afterwards, as ſoon as it is obſervable, by the Marks above explain'd, that there is a neceſſity of changing them, the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as before muſt be us'd, to put them into other <hi>Caſes</hi> of ſeventeen or eighteen Inches; in which they muſt likewiſe be preſerv'd for the ſpace of three or four Years; at the end of which, they muſt be remov'd again, for the fourth time, in the manner aforeſaid, either into the ſame <hi>Caſes,</hi> or into others of the ſame Size.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty of Tranſportation commonly hinders me, after the wearing out of theſe ſecond <hi>Caſes</hi> of eighteen Inches, from venturing to put them into larger; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, would be very proper for them, being about twenty one or twenty two Inches, which, however, ſhould be the laſt I would remove them into, unleſs I had very great Conveniencies, both for the Tranſporting of them, and for the Laying of them up.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48210:164"/>
And whereas, at length, thoſe Caſed <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> would grow to ſuch a degree of largeneſs and weight, as would require too many Machines to move them, and even too great a quantity of <hi>Water</hi> to give them due <hi>Waterings,</hi> I abandon them, after having <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated</hi> them for the ſpace of fifteen or twenty Years; and take no farther Care of them, than to <hi>Plant</hi> them, either into our own <hi>Gardens,</hi> or in ſome of our Friends; for which they are yet good enough, provided Care be taken to cut off a conſiderable part of their <hi>Wood,</hi> and eſpecially the main part of their <hi>Roots;</hi> or elſe, with a great deal of Regret, I reſolve to burn them. But, in the mean time, in order to have my <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> and my <hi>Fig-Garden,</hi> always equally fill'd, I yearly rear up new ones, in the manner aforeſaid; which ſerve to fill up the room of the old ones I have been oblig'd to part with.</p>
                        <p>The beſt of it is, that the Breeding of them is eaſie: Firſt, Becauſe the <hi>Feet</hi> of the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> that are <hi>Planted</hi> in the main <hi>Ground ſhoot</hi> abundance of <hi>Rooted Suckers.</hi> Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very eaſie to lay <hi>Branches</hi> into the <hi>Ground,</hi> round about every old <hi>Foot,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their taking <hi>Root.</hi> And Finally, becauſe ſome may be bred by means of bended <hi>Layers,</hi> plac'd a little in the Shade, it is good to make a little Gaſh in thoſe towards the Extremity, though many ſucceed without it.</p>
                        <p>Thus there are abundance of Means, and all very eaſie, in order to make a pretty good Proviſion of ſmall young <hi>Fig-Trees:</hi> Wo to that <hi>Gard'ner</hi> who does not do it, and does not uſe his utmoſt Skill to multiply ſo good a <hi>Tree;</hi> trying immediately, whenever he is oblig'd to cut ſome <hi>Fig-Branches,</hi> to make thoſe <hi>Layers</hi> take <hi>Root;</hi> at he may do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it has a little <hi>Wood</hi> of two Years ſtanding; becauſe that thoſe cut <hi>Branches</hi> that are but of a Years ſtanding, are much apter to rot, than to take <hi>Root.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The greateſt Inconveniency attending <hi>Caſes,</hi> is that which I have mention'd hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which is, that, during the Months of <hi>June, July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> there is an indiſpenſible neceſſity of <hi>Watering</hi> them largely every Day, inſomuch that the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> may penetrate through the bottom of the <hi>Caſe;</hi> at leaſt, without fail, they muſt be <hi>Water'd</hi> ſo every other Day, unleſs it <hi>Rains</hi> very hard; not that the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Rains</hi> often penetrates the Body of the <hi>Mote;</hi> but, becauſe while it <hi>Rains,</hi> there is no <hi>Sun-ſhine</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of penetrating through the <hi>Caſe,</hi> to dry up the <hi>Roots;</hi> which is the only Reaſon that may ſtop the Continuation of <hi>Watering.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither muſt ſmall <hi>Rains</hi> be minded, they are of no uſe to <hi>Fig-Trees;</hi> on the contrary, often prejudice them, by perſuading the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> they are ſufficient to ſupply the want of <hi>Watering,</hi> which they are not; the broad <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> hindering the <hi>Earth</hi> (which lies very cloſe in the <hi>Caſe,</hi> and is very hard by an Infinity of <hi>Roots)</hi> from being ſoak'd by an inconſiderable <hi>Rain,</hi> ſince even great <hi>Showers</hi> cannot do it.</p>
                        <p>It is moſt certain that the <hi>Fruit</hi> is in danger of dropping down, and periſhing, the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ceaſing never ſo little to act, for want of Moiſture, and to furniſh the <hi>Figs</hi> with the perpetual help they ſtand indiſpenſibly in need of; which will certainly happen, upon failure of the great and frequent <hi>Waterings</hi> we recommend: For thoſe <hi>Figs</hi> that have wanted the leaſt Nouriſhment, remain flobby, and, as it were, full of Wind, inſtead of being fill'd up with a good pithy <hi>Pulp;</hi> and ſo, inſtead of <hi>Ripening,</hi> drop down; which is the greateſt Inconvenience that can be fear'd; and conſequently, this requires ſo great an Application, that it is no eaſie matter to ſucceed in <hi>Fig-Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Planted in the main <hi>Ground</hi> requires no ſuch Slavery; ſince ſuch as are <hi>Planted</hi> even in very dry <hi>Soils</hi> commonly produce Fine Large Good <hi>Figs;</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> which have the liberty of extending round about, tho' the Earth be never ſo parch'd, ſtill find wherewithal to perform their Function and Duty: and in imitation of thoſe, when the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Caſes touch the <hi>Ground,</hi> commonly ſome <hi>Roots</hi> get out of it, which take into that very Ground, and there multiply to that degree, that they are able to live without frequent Waterings: But then they are liable to other Inconveniencies, which I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>There now remains to ſpeak of the <hi>Pruning</hi> and <hi>Pinching</hi> or <hi>Breaking,</hi> which I Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> either Planted in the main Ground, or in Caſes; both for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Fine <hi>Trees,</hi> according to the Beauty proper to thoſe <hi>Trees,</hi> as well as to make them ſhoot the <hi>Figs</hi> the ſooner, every one in their Seaſon; that is, not only the firſt, which are call'd <hi>Bloſſom-Figs,</hi> but alſo the ſecond, call'd <hi>Autumn,</hi> or <hi>Second-Figs,</hi> and <hi>Figs</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Sap,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>As to the Beauty proper to <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in Caſes, it is not to be expected that it can be ſo regular as that of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that are likewiſe in Caſes; neither can the Beauty of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> or againſt a <hi>Wall,</hi> be expected ſo perfect as that of <hi>Dwarf-Pear-Trees,</hi> or other <hi>Wall-Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have ſufficiently explain'd thoſe kind of Beauties, each in particular, in <hi>Treatiſes</hi> written upon that Subject, without repeating it here: It will ſuffice to ſay, That the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48210:165"/>
Beauty of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in Caſes, conſiſts chiefly in being real <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> without having any <hi>Stem</hi> if poſſible; and laſtly, in not Shooting too high, or being too much Extended, and open, with great bare <hi>Branches,</hi> which is but too common in thoſe <hi>Trees,</hi> unleſs an extraordinary Care be taken of them.</p>
                        <p>There is no great neceſſity of ſaying, that at the end of Winter, or at the beginning of the Spring, it will be neceſſary to <hi>Trim</hi> or <hi>Pluck off</hi> all the Dead <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> either in the main ground, or in Caſes, no body being ignorant of it: Thoſe kind of <hi>Trees</hi> having very <hi>Pithy</hi> or <hi>Sappy Branches,</hi> are liable to have a great many of them ſpoyl'd, tho' the Cold be never ſo moderate. We have often Experienc'd it, particularly in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of 1675. in which there was not half an inch of Ice in any part, and yet a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of <hi>Fig-Tree Branches</hi> periſh'd; as if the abſence of heat alone was capable to deſtroy them; conſequently, a far greater quantity muſt periſh in long hard Winters, as we had in 1670, and 1676. in which, the Froſt was ſo terrible, and our <hi>Gard'ners</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſo much by it, that they were forc'd almoſt in all parts, to cut the thickeſt <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> within the very <hi>Foot,</hi> altho' they had been pretty well cover'd either with Straw, or dry Dung; even in ſo much, that the very Snow, which is a Soveraign Remedy for the Preſervation of many young Tender <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Peaſe, Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Lettuce,</hi> &amp;c. could not avail for the preſervation of thoſe Well-belov'd unfortunate <hi>Fig-Trees;</hi> nay, rather Contributed to their deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that ſome <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> tho' pretty Careful, have (notwithſtanding their Care) had the Ill luck to ſee part of their <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Periſh, when no body could impute the leaſt fault to them, which was occaſion'd by the Walls where thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> were Planted, not being thick enough to hinder the rigour of the Froſt from penetrating through them; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thoſe whoſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are Planted againſt good Buildings, particularly, near Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, that are actually us'd, or at leaſt, againſt Walls about two foot thick, and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd: Happy likewiſe are thoſe who have them in dry Elevated Situations, and yet in a good Ground.</p>
                        <p>And Conſequently, unhappy all thoſe, who having none of theſe advantages, are expos'd to all that's pernicious for <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> as thin Walls to their <hi>Gardens,</hi> a Cold and Moiſt Soil, wanting both a favourable Climate, and Situation.</p>
                        <p>Since then <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are as difficult in the preſervation, as their <hi>Fruit</hi> is Precious; let us give an exact Summary of what we think moſt proper, at leaſt to endeavour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of them as much as can be poſſible, from what is capable of deſtroying of them.</p>
                        <p>The Inconveniencies wherewith they are threaten'd, do not hinder me, as I have already declar'd, in the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the Choice and Proportion of <hi>Fruit,</hi> from adviſing every body to Plant a reaſonable quantity of them; I mean in the main Ground, having ſomewhat of the Situation that is proper for them, tho wanting ſome of the Conditions that were to be wiſh'd for, for them.</p>
                        <p>Great Winters do not happen ſo often, as to diſcourage us for ever from having ſome of thoſe kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> which produce ſuch an Excellent <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The moſt material thing in this Caſe for the Culture, is firſt, during the Summer, and Autumn, to give their <hi>Branches</hi> ſome liberty, the <hi>Fruits</hi> growing better, and more eaſily upon them: They muſt neither be Conſtrain'd, nor Palliſado'd, or tack'd like the <hi>Branches</hi> of other <hi>Wall-Fruit-Trees;</hi> it will ſuffice to uphold them before with ſome Pearches barely plac'd upon great Hooks driven into the Walls, ſo as to be at three foot diſtance from each other; and that beginning from the bottom, there may be a Row within a foot of the Ground, Checker-wiſe: Thoſe Hooks muſt be four Inches into the Wall, and about eight on the outſide, made, as it appears in the Figure.</p>

                        <p>In the ſecond Place, every Year, as ſoon as the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> are fallen, that is, as ſoon as the Winter draws nigh, whatever that Winter may prove; for we muſt always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48210:165"/>
no part may remain bare, and expos'd to the weather. Beſides all which, another parcel of the ſame long Dung muſt be kept ready near the <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> to double the Coverings if need be, one ſingle Night being ſufficient to ruine all. North Eaſt Winds, as we had them in the Winter 1676. and the South Winds, like unto thoſe of the Winter 1670. are likewiſe ſometimes Mortal for <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> and commonly more than full North, ſo that a guard muſt be kept equally againſt them all.</p>
                        <p>Whenever then any body deſigns to have <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> they muſt be prepar'd to take all the Care we have mention'd, as neceſſary for their Preſervation: But when, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, ſome prove ſo unfortunate as not to ſucceed, which without doubt will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but ſeldom, provided the Walls they ſtand againſt, are condition'd as aforeſaid: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſay, this ſhould happen, in my Opinion it ought not to trouble one, ſince nothing has been wanting that lay in the Power of Man.</p>
                        <p>The Winter being paſt, and even the Month of <hi>March</hi> almoſt quite ſpent, if the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ſtand againſt the Wall, only half their Covering muſt be taken away, eſpecially that part the Winter may have ſpoyl'd or rotten, and leave the <hi>Branches</hi> ſtill fix'd thus to the Wall, at leaſt always half cover'd, without altering any thing about them, until the Full Moon of <hi>April;</hi> provided always, that if the Full Moon of <hi>March,</hi> which happens in the Paſſion-Week, ſeems to threaten ſome Froſt, as it often does, you muſt not fail at the leaſt ſignal of it to redouble the Coverings immediately, there to leave them until the Weather appear more certain, and the <hi>Figs</hi> are grown to the bigneſs of a Large Pea; which in our Climates ſeldom happens until the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> for as we have already ſaid, the main part of the great Colds ſeldom leave us 'till then: At which time it will be proper to put ſome ſmall <hi>Branches,</hi> heretofore ty'd and conſtrain'd, at liberty; but yet, as I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaid, not without propping them with Pearches croſswiſe, to hinder them from falling too much forward: This, in my Opinion, is a ſufficient ſtay, thoſe Pearches put upon Hooks ſupporting the <hi>Branches</hi> very well, and hindering them, not only from falling, but alſo from breaking, and being ruffled by the Wind, and the <hi>Fruit</hi> is thereby preſerv'd ſound and intire.</p>
                        <p>I muſt farther add, that Large Sheets are proper enough to cover (during dangerous or ſuſpected Nights) <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> being near the Wall, either Planted there, or in Caſes; to which end they muſt be faſten'd to the Pearches, like Sails to Maſts, and beſides, put other long Perches almoſt ſtraight over the <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> to hinder the Sheets being agitated by the Winds, from touching the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the rubbing of the Sheets againſt them never failing to ſpoyl them; ſo that it will likewiſe be convenient to tie thoſe Sheets near the Ground, by means of ſome Hooks that may hinder them from ſuch Agitations.</p>
                        <p>The third Material thing to be done for the Culture of thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> is early to remove at the end of Winter, or even at the end of Autumn, the greateſt part of the <hi>Suckers</hi> or <hi>Layers</hi> they ſhoot from their <hi>Foot,</hi> without preſerving any, unleſs it be ſome that may appear to be of uſe, either to fill up the ſides, or to ſupply the room of ſuch as are dead, or dying: Beſides, a good uſe will be made of thoſe <hi>Suckers,</hi> or <hi>Layers,</hi> Planting them in ſome Trench made on purpoſe for it near ſome good Wall; and whether there, or elſewhere, Care muſt be taken to cover them ſo well, that the great Cold may not be able to ſpoil them.</p>
                        <p>It is not leſs neceſſary to hinder as much as can be, thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> from raiſing ſoon to a great heighth, for Example, to two or three fathom, to the end, that keeping them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a moderate heighth, they may conſequently always remain full, and well furniſh'd, eſpecially, eaſie to cover in the Winter time, which cannot be when they are too high: Therefore from year to year the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> muſt ſeldom be allow'd more than a Foot, a Foot and a half, or two Foot at moſt, which is the only <hi>Pruning</hi> they require, after having, as we have already ſaid, clear'd them from all manner of dead <hi>Wood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> it is fit to break the end of the Extremety of every thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which may chance not to be above a Foot in length, provided the Winter has not already ſpoil'd it, which happens commonly to ſuch as have only been finiſh'd a great way in Autumn, but ſeldom happens to ſuch as have been perfected betimes; however, that end which appears black, wrinkled, and dead, muſt be cut neatly.</p>
                        <p>This Method of <hi>Pinching</hi> or <hi>Pruning,</hi> ſerves to make ſeveral New <hi>Branches</hi> grow forked, inſtead of ſhooting ſingle, which in regularity would have grown ſtraight, that end being indeed a real beginning of a <hi>Branch:</hi> This breaking then promiſes a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Figs,</hi> either for the ſecond, which is moſt common, or for the firſt of the Summer for the following year; it being certain, that from the Navel of every <hi>Leaf</hi> a <hi>Fig</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly grow, and ſometimes two at once, for one of thoſe two Seaſons.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Breaking,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Pruning</hi> of the <hi>Bud,</hi> which appears on the Extremity, ſerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as it ſeems, to make the <hi>Figs</hi> ſhoot out the ſooner, and conſequently to Ripen them
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48210:166"/>
ſooner, ſince the firſt that come out of the <hi>Tree</hi> are always the firſt Ripe upon that <hi>Tree;</hi> It ſerves likewiſe, without doubt, to make them grow the larger, by reaſon that the <hi>Sap</hi> being thus hinder'd from riſing as quick as it would have done without this <hi>Pruning,</hi> ſlips, as it were, into the adjacent Parts, and conſequently into the <hi>Figs,</hi> and ſo ſerves to nouriſh them better than they ſhould have been.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Operation which we perform in <hi>Breaking</hi> or <hi>Cutting</hi> in the Months of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> the ends of the <hi>Shoots</hi> of the preceding year, which is to be underſtood of thoſe that are thick, and moderately long; for the ſlender ones muſt be almoſt taken away quite, and as for thoſe that are very thick, and very long, we have heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd how they muſt be ſhorten'd: The ſame Operation muſt be perform'd at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>June,</hi> upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> ſhot in the Spring, and that likewiſe in Order to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply that very Summer the <hi>Branches</hi> that are to grow, and conſequently to multiply the firſt <hi>Figs</hi> of the following year; for many <hi>Figs</hi> muſt not be expected in either Seaſon, unleſs by means of <hi>Pinching</hi> a great many good new <hi>Branches</hi> be prepar'd, which happens infallibly, when People are careful of <hi>Pinching;</hi> beſides, this very Operation produces yet a wonderful effect, which is to hinder the <hi>Tree</hi> from mounting too much, and too ſoon, and from having <hi>Branches</hi> that may prove too thick, and too long, as well as bare, which is much to be fear'd.</p>
                        <p>If the preceeding year ſome thick <hi>Branches</hi> have been allow'd a pretty length, which in their time have been good and uſeful, and yet give cauſe to fear the inconvenience of Thinneſs, or Barrenneſs, they muſt in the Months of <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> eſpecially having no <hi>Fruit</hi> upon them, be ſhorten'd very low, cloſe to the old <hi>Wood,</hi> in hopes that new <hi>Branches</hi> may proceed from that <hi>Pruning;</hi> but that is no more infallible here, than upon the old <hi>Branches</hi> of ſhorten'd <hi>Peach-Trees:</hi> However, it will ſerve at leaſt not to leave any thing with too much length, which might cauſe an Emptineſs, or Barrenneſs; and in the mean time the <hi>Sap</hi> will perform its effect upon ſome of the adjacent <hi>Branches,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo upon the old one that has been ſhorten'd; but yet it is certain that <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhoot ſo well, as from the Natural Extremity, I mean the Extremity of the <hi>Branches</hi> of the preceeding years growth, not having been Cut.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> in relation to their <hi>Fruit,</hi> are contrary to all other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> becauſe that the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> provided they be not of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> they being liable to it, as well as other <hi>Trees,</hi> produce the <hi>Fruit;</hi> whereas the ſlender ones produce it in other <hi>Fruit-Trees;</hi> therefore as much Care muſt be had in deſtroying the ſlender <hi>Branches</hi> upon theſe <hi>Trees,</hi> as in preſerving them upon others.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Suckers,</hi> are known here by flat <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> and their being at a great diſtance from each other, in the ſame manner as upon Stone and Kernel <hi>Fruit;</hi> which <hi>Branches</hi> muſt of neceſſity be <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſomewhat ſhort, which needs not be done to ſuch which being happily grown on the Extremities of other <hi>Branches,</hi> are both very good, and of a moderate length, and as ſuch have thick or large cloſe <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe particularly to be Noted, That in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the thick <hi>Branches</hi> here is a greater Conflict to undergo, than in other <hi>Trees;</hi> ſince, as we have already often ſaid, the thick <hi>Branches</hi> never produce or bear <hi>Fruit</hi> upon thoſe, and only ſerve for the Figure: Whereas in <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> the thick <hi>Branches</hi> ſerve both for the Figure, and for the Bearing of <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſo that particularly, as to the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in Caſes, whereof the Chief Beauty conſiſts in remaining low; it ſeems almoſt impoſſible to have them at once well form'd, to be of an agreeable Figure, and yet full of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which, notwithſtanding, is the main Point here; for as the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in Caſes naturally produce but little <hi>Wood,</hi> and that whatever <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> has but little <hi>Wood,</hi> can have but little <hi>Fruit.</hi> In ſhort'ning the thick <hi>Branches</hi> in proſpect of the Figure, we decline the <hi>Fruit.</hi> The only Medium to be obſerv'd in this, is always to ſhorten ſome of the thickeſt in every <hi>Tree,</hi> either old, or new, which will ſerve for the Beauty of the Figure; at the ſame time venturing to leave all the other long, to enjoy the <hi>Fruit</hi> that appears upon them: In caſe any Misfortune be befal'n the firſt <hi>Figs,</hi> and that towards the middle of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> any be deſirous to ſhorten alſo ſome of thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> that had been left long for <hi>Fruit,</hi> it may be done, and in ſo doing, the number of the ſecond <hi>Figs</hi> will receive ſo much diminution; but then, to make amends, the number of the firſt for the next year will be augmented, by reaſon that the new <hi>Branches</hi> that ſhall ſhoot from thoſe that ſhall have been <hi>Prun'd,</hi> will not come out ſoon enough to produce Autumn <hi>Figs,</hi> but yet time enough for the others.</p>
                        <p>In hot Soils, all the <hi>Figs</hi> come out before the end of <hi>March,</hi> and the <hi>Trees</hi> begin to make new <hi>Shoots</hi> before the end of <hi>April,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Fruit</hi> Ripens before the end of <hi>June,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and the ſecond in the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> But in Cold Soils, like <hi>Verſailles,</hi> the <hi>Figs</hi> do not come out till about the end of <hi>April,</hi> or even towards the middle of <hi>May;</hi> and the <hi>Shoots</hi> do not begin to appear neither, until towards the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48210:166"/>
middle of <hi>May;</hi> and the <hi>Shoots</hi> do not begin to appear neither, until towards the middle of <hi>May;</hi> and conſequently, the firſt <hi>Fruits</hi> do not ripen there, until the middle or end of <hi>July;</hi> and the ſecond, towards the latter end of <hi>September.</hi>

                        <p>From every <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> which, in <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> remain, in the Spring, upon the thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the preceding Year, we may certainly expect a <hi>Fig,</hi> and ſometimes two; but we muſt never have above one which may come to good, if the Seaſon be favourable: And, moreover, every <hi>Eye</hi> may produce a <hi>Branch,</hi> which does not always happen, it depending from the thickneſs of the Mother-<hi>Branch,</hi> and the ſhort <hi>Pruning</hi> that has been perform'd upon it. Beſides, every good <hi>Branch</hi> commonly produces to the number of ſix or ſeven <hi>Figs;</hi> that is to ſay, that it may be grown longer, by ſix or ſeven <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds;</hi> either from the Month of <hi>March,</hi> to the middle of <hi>June;</hi> or from the middle of <hi>June,</hi> to the end of Autumn; it ſeldom produces any more. Beſides, <hi>Figs</hi> never grow twice upon the ſame <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Bud;</hi> that which has produc'd any in Autumn, whether they ripen, or no, producing no others the next Seaſon.</p>
                        <p>More Preparations muſt be us'd to make the firſt <hi>Figs</hi> grow, than the ſecond; there being conſtantly but too many of theſe, becauſe that ſound <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> commonly <hi>ſhoot</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine <hi>Sprigs,</hi> and that every <hi>Leaf</hi> form'd before Midſummer, generally owes a <hi>Fig,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Autumn of that very Year, which is moſt common; or for the Summer of the following Year, when the <hi>Fig</hi> has not appear'd in Autumn. This being ſo, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens almoſt always, that abundance of thoſe <hi>Figs</hi> for <hi>Autumn</hi> do appear, which grow in vain, by reaſon that they ſeldom ripen; the cold Rains, that are frequent and common in Autumn, and the white Froſts of the Seaſon, killing them almoſt all, either in making them burſt, and open, and ſo fall, or drop; or elſe, hindring them from growing to Maturity: And, as for theſe, it is not to be expected, that, notwithſtanding they have been preſerv'd <hi>Green</hi> in the Winter, and well fix'd to the <hi>Tree,</hi> the Renewing of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the Spring ſhould bring them to any Perfection; it being moſt certain, that they will drop, without coming to any thing.</p>
                        <p>But as for thoſe <hi>Figs</hi> we call <hi>Figs</hi> of the firſt <hi>Sap,</hi> or Midſummer-<hi>Figs,</hi> as they only grow in proportion to the <hi>Shoots</hi> and <hi>Leaves, ſhot</hi> from Midſummer, till towards Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; and that often <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> particularly in <hi>Caſes,</hi> produce but few <hi>Branches,</hi> and regularly ſhort, having but little Vigour in the Summer, and yet being oblig'd to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh their <hi>Fruit,</hi> it follows conſequently, that they produce but a ſmall quantity of <hi>Fruit</hi> for the Spring, the weak <hi>Branches</hi> neither being capable to bear any at that time, nor when they do bear them, of preſerving them againſt the Cold of the Seaſon; wherefore it is fit to have very particular Regards, in order to make <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> and particularly thoſe that are in <hi>Caſes,</hi> produce fine <hi>Shoots</hi> after Midſummer, which depends upon the Vigour of the <hi>Foot;</hi> and more particularly on the Aſſiſtance we ought to afford it, when in that Condition.</p>
                        <p>When ſome <hi>Branches</hi> are preſerv'd, being ſomewhat weak, they muſt be kept very ſhort, to the end that the Remainder may be the better nouriſh'd, and that the <hi>Figs,</hi> if any can grow upon them, may grow the finer; but ſtill, upon condition that if any other weak <hi>Branches</hi> ſhould <hi>ſhoot</hi> from thoſe, they ſhall all be taken away, and none preſerv'd, unleſs perhaps the loweſt, which thereby may grow to a reaſonable thickneſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſame <hi>Care</hi> that is taken of <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>Caſes,</hi> juſt after the Winter, placing them in good Situations, ought likewiſe to be taken to place them alſo in proper Situations at the Coming in of Autumn, to the end that, in order to the Maturity of the <hi>Figs</hi> of that Seaſon, they may receive the Benefit of the little Heat the Sun affords us at that time. But then, none of the <hi>Roots</hi> muſt be allow'd to get out of the <hi>Caſes,</hi> by reaſon that there being a neceſſity of pulling them out, in tranſporting of the <hi>Caſes,</hi> both the <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> would ſuffer conſiderably by it, which muſt needs create a Subject of Trouble.</p>
                        <p>But then, the only Remedy, when the bottom of the <hi>Caſes</hi> has touch'd the <hi>Ground</hi> in the Summer time, the <hi>Roots</hi> of the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> having extreamly multiply'd there, and the <hi>Trees</hi> being really the better for it, ſo as not to ſtand in need of ſuch frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> though, at the ſame time, it rots the <hi>Caſes</hi> the ſooner; the bottom of the <hi>Caſes</hi> having thus touch'd the <hi>Ground,</hi> it will be neceſſary, before they are put in the <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> to cut all thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> well; or, at leaſt, it muſt be done at the Taking them out again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are carry'd to the place where they are to remain all the Summer; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part of them has been expos'd to the Air, abſolutely ſpoils: But, after having taken off what is ſpoil'd, thoſe very <hi>Caſes,</hi> being again put upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> will multiply again, more than the Year before. And it is not amiſs to ſacrifice thus ſome <hi>Caſes,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as begin to be old, and of which the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> have been long <hi>Cas'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

Moreover, Whereas the firſt <hi>Figs</hi> may always ripen, whatever Situation they be in, the Heats of the Summer being ſufficient for that, it induces me to place <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> willingly into the Weſt Part, and pretty often likewiſe to the North; by which means I have <hi>Figs</hi> much longer, thoſe that are plac'd in thoſe indifferent Situations ripening after the others; ſo that they almoſt ſupply the Interval, between the Firſt, and the Second: In which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe others to imitate me; but yet, upon condition, not to expect Autumn-<hi>Figs</hi> from ſuch Situations, unleſs the Seaſon proves extraordinary fine and dry. And when <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> have been plac'd in ſuch Expoſitions, or Situations, great Care muſt be taken to cover them yet better in the Winter, than thoſe that were plac'd in the other Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations.</p>
                        <p>Particular Precautions muſt be had for <hi>Fig-Trees Planted</hi> in the <hi>Ground;</hi> eſpecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to place them under the <hi>Spouts</hi> of great <hi>Coverings,</hi> which might threaten them with too much <hi>Water,</hi> and particularly, with a great deal of mizling Froſt, as well in the Winter, as in the Spring: And in caſe there be no other place proper to Plant them in, thoſe <hi>Spouts</hi> muſt be turn'd ſome other way, by means of ſome Wooden or Leaden Gutter.</p>
                        <p>As to the Method of <hi>Pruning Dwarf-Standard Fig-Trees,</hi> there is nothing to be added to what we have already ſaid of thoſe that are <hi>Planted</hi> againſt <hi>Walls,</hi> or in <hi>Caſes.</hi> The <hi>Dwarf-Standards</hi> will not produce <hi>Figs,</hi> altogether ſo ſoon as thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> that are well Expos'd, and even later than thoſe that are in <hi>Caſes:</hi> which being heated by the Sun, on all ſides of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> ripen, as we have already ſaid, a little ſooner than the <hi>Dwarf-Standards,</hi> and even ſooner than the <hi>Eſpaliers.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Dwarfs</hi> will likewiſe be a little troubleſom for the Coverings of the Winter, and therefore it is dangerous to have any of thoſe, unleſs it be in very little, private places, and thoſe ſhelter'd from great Froſts: they will likewiſe be apt to cauſe a Confuſion, if, being in a good Soil, Endeavours be us'd to keep them low, and to hinder them at the ſame time, from producing great <hi>Shoots:</hi> For which reaſon, it will be neceſſary to <hi>Pinch</hi> them carefully, and to have always ſome thick <hi>Branches, Prun'd</hi> low; and finally, to clear and free them often, as well from ſo many old worn out <hi>Branches,</hi> as from all new <hi>Suckers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To that End, ſuch <hi>Dwarf-Standards</hi> muſt always be kept at a very conſiderable diſtance from each other, in order to lay a great many <hi>Branches</hi> yearly into the <hi>Ground,</hi> thereby to eaſe the whole Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> ſuffering it to grow in breadth as much as it pleaſes. As to their Coverings, Care muſt be taken, at the End of Autumn, firſt to aſſemble and cloſe their <hi>Branches</hi> together with <hi>Oziers,</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> fix'd into the <hi>Ground,</hi> that they may form a kind of Bowl, or Pyramid; cloſing it afterwards with long, dry <hi>Dung,</hi> as we have done to <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in <hi>Eſpaliers;</hi> but yet they muſt not be uncover'd quite, altogether ſo ſoon as the others that are ſhelter'd by a <hi>Wall;</hi> and the Coverings muſt, by all means, be renew'd, during the Spring.</p>
                        <p>After having explain'd my Method, as well as poſſible I can, as well for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of all kinds of young <hi>Trees,</hi> during the four or five firſt Years of their being <hi>Planted,</hi> as for the <hi>Trimming</hi> for the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uſeleſs <hi>Sprigs,</hi> and <hi>Pinching</hi> of ſuch as may ſtand in need of it, having alſo explain'd my Method, as to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> planted either in the open <hi>Ground,</hi> or <hi>Caſes;</hi> I now proceed, according to my Promiſe, to explain, with the ſame Exactneſs, my Opinion, as to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of old <hi>Trees.</hi>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SInce <hi>Pruning</hi> may be look'd upon as a kind of Remedy for <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and that really we have made uſe of the Rules and Principles thereof, in order to render the young <hi>Trees</hi> in our <hi>Gardens</hi> more agreeable as to their Figure, as well as more Fertile in fine and good <hi>Fruit,</hi> than they would have been without being <hi>Prun'd;</hi> being now to treat about a proper Remedy for Old <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> I am of Opinion, that, to make my ſelf the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood, I muſt firſt of all ſuppoſe two things; the one in relation to their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, or Weakneſs: And I am likewiſe of Opinion, that it will be proper for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this laſt Part, before I meddle with the firſt, this being altogether grounded upon the other; and thoſe vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> requiring abſolutely to be treated in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from thoſe that are not ſo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48210:167"/>
As to what relates to the Vigour or Weakneſs of <hi>Trees,</hi> we are to ſay, that thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> are either very vigorous, producing abundance of thick <hi>Shoots,</hi> or very weak, hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any, or at moſt but very ſmall ones; or in fine, neither incline too much to an exceſs of Vigour, or of Weakneſs, ſo as to be in the Caſe we may wiſh to have them: Theſe are abſolutely the three different Caſes <hi>Trees</hi> can be in.</p>
                        <p>When they are very Vigorous, and as it were Furious, whether the Beauty of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure be already form'd, or not, we muſt ſtill propoſe to our ſelves, that whenever we go about to <hi>Prune</hi> them, it will be proper above all things, to leave a great Burthen upon them, that is, to leave a great many out-lets upon them, not only for <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> but alſo for <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood;</hi> which is perform'd two ways; of which the firſt is to allow thick <hi>Branches</hi> preſerv'd for the eſtabliſhing or preſerving of a Beautiful Figure, ſomewhat of an extraordinary length: The ſecond is, not wholly to take away hardly any of their thick new <hi>Branches,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as ſhoot outward; but after having choſen in each part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> among the thick ones, that which appears the beſt plac'd to Contribute to the Beauty of the Figure, and that with an intention to ſhorten it moderately, according to its Situation, which I explain elſewhere; after that, I ſay, the adjacent <hi>Branches</hi> to that muſt be cut very ſhort, that is, if they ſhoot outwards they muſt be Cut ſlantingly, within one or two <hi>Eyes</hi> of the place whence they proceed; if altogether inward, within the thickneſs of a Crown Piece.</p>
                        <p>When I ſpeak of allowing ſomewhat of an extraordinary length in <hi>Praning</hi> to a <hi>Branch</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> I mean a Foot and a half, or two Foot at moſt, and yet I ſeldom Practice this my ſelf; but whenever I do, 'tis always with an intention of reducing that extraordinary length to a more moderate one, as ſoon as the <hi>Tree</hi> bears <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to underſtand what is meant by ſhortning a Thick <hi>Branch</hi> moderately, it will be proper to remember, that whereas from the Extremity of a thick <hi>Branch</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> ſeveral other new ones will proceed, Care muſt be taken to leave room, that is, an empty Place, where theſe New <hi>Branches</hi> may eaſily lodge themſelves, without cauſing any Confuſion among one another, or with thoſe that are there already, or ſuch as are to come; which is the Point upon which I would have People regulate themſelves as to the moderate length which is to be allow'd to ſuch thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are to be <hi>Prun'd;</hi> but yet, in Regularity, a Vigorous <hi>Tree</hi> muſt ſeldom be allow'd thick <hi>Branches,</hi> unleſs they be at leaſt ſeven or eight Inches in length, and ſometimes in Caſe of neceſſity they may be allow'd to the number of Eleven or Twelve, always remembring, that the ſaid <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be cut ſhorter, whenever the <hi>Tree</hi> ſhall ſatisfie us with <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſo that it depends on the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Prudence to allow more or leſs length to ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> that is to be ſhorten'd, and that as well in reſpect to the Vigour it appears to be of, as to the Place that is to be fill'd up in the Neighbourhood thereof.</p>
                        <p>When Old <hi>Trees</hi> are very Weak, commonly the beſt Expedlent is to take them away, and put young ones in their room, after having us'd all the Precaution neceſſary in ſuch Caſes; but if, on the Contrary, People will preſerve them, they muſt reſolve to disburthen or clear them extreamly, either in giving them the Figure which is proper to them, which perhaps they want, or in order to preſerve it, if already acquir'd; to which end, they muſt reſolve to leave very few <hi>Branches</hi> for <hi>Wood</hi> upon them, and to <hi>Prune</hi> them all ſhort, that is, five or ſix Inches in length at moſt, even reſolving to leave but very few weak ones, and conſequently no uſeleſs ones, eſpecially ſuch as ſeem to be waſted with Air, without having born any <hi>Fruit,</hi> or ſuch as are waſted by having produc'd much; for as we have already obſerv'd in ſundry Places, <hi>Branches</hi> periſh in Bearing, and even ſome Periſh ſometimes after having born: Therefore thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be conſiderably ſhorten'd, or even taken away quite, when they appear altogether waſted, and conſequently uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>But when <hi>Trees</hi> are moderate, ſo as neither to fall into the exceſs of Vigour, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but on the contrary, bear a reaſonable quantity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Wood</hi> in ſome meaſure, according to our deſires, both for us, and for themſelves; in ſuch a Caſe, thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> being pretty well ſhap'd, it will be fit, in relation to them, to follow as well the Rules heretofore preſcrib'd for young <hi>Trees,</hi> as thoſe we are going to preſcribe; and if thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> are ill Condition'd, or ill Shap'd, endeavours muſt be us'd to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them better, which we will viſibly diſcover, after having firſt Explain'd what concerns the Figure, which is proper for all manner of Old <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon this Caſe, we muſt moreover ſuppoſe, that thoſe kind of <hi>Trees</hi> are either already <note place="margin">Perfections of the Figure of a <hi>Dwarf-Tree.</hi>
                           </note> defective, and in diſorder, or perhaps are upon the point of becoming ſo: This is the firſt Reflection to be carefully made at firſt ſight of a <hi>Tree</hi> that is to be <hi>Prun'd,</hi> whatever it may be, <hi>Wall-Tree,</hi> or <hi>Dwarf,</hi> in order to reſolve with more eaſe upon what is to be done in relation to the Figure.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>AS to the firſt Caſe, which ſuppoſes a <hi>Dwarf</hi> to be too high in the <hi>Stem,</hi> I think it need not trouble us much, if the <hi>Tree</hi> has been Planted long, becauſe it cannot be remedy'd without falling into conſiderable Inconveniencies, which ſhould be wholly to deſtroy the head of the <hi>Dwarf,</hi> and conſequently ſet it back for the ſpace of three or four years from bearing <hi>Fruit:</hi> The Remedy would be violent, and therefore I do not think it fit to meddle with the <hi>Stem</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> tho' too high, and in that reſpect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective: In that Caſe, I am only for Correcting the Defects of the Head.</p>
                        <p>But when the <hi>Tree</hi> has not been Planted many years, to wit, two or three years, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Head being ill begun, and not according to the Rules of Art, my Opinion is to ſhorten it quite, to reduce it to the Rule, which preſcribes it to have a low <hi>Stem,</hi> as it is declar'd in the Treatiſe of <hi>Plantations;</hi> which I had rather do, than expoſe my ſelf to leave it always with ſuch a Defect, which muſt offend the ſight perpetually: A <hi>Tree</hi> well <hi>Rooted</hi> again, and afterwards ſhorten'd, ſoon recovers it ſelf, ſo as to afford a great deal of pleaſure, and upon that account we are not only Comforted, but even very much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with having ſhorten'd it in that manner.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſecond Defect of a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> which is its being confus'd in the middle; when I meet with a <hi>Tree</hi> thus confus'd in the Figure, and conſequently not very proper to bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> I commonly look upon it as I would do upon a Great Lord, who really has a great Eſtate, and yet is not eaſie, by reaſon of the great Incumbrances that lye upon it: The Selling of ſome part of his Eſtate, or of a Place, might be capable to clear his Debts; whereas on the contrary, when I ſee a <hi>Tree</hi> well ſhap'd, and well diſpos'd, I fancy I ſee another Man, who by the wiſe Management of a Moderate Eſtate, wants for nothing, and lives at eaſe and quiet.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I am for Correcting that ſecond Defect intirely, as well to afford the <hi>Tree</hi> the Beauty it ought to have, as to facilitate the means of making it bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that ſo much the rather, becauſe the Remedy is eaſie, and the Succeſs ſpeedy, certain, and without the leaſt danger.</p>
                        <p>'Tis only removing altogether a thick <hi>Branch</hi> from the middle, or perhaps two or three that cauſe that fullneſs; that is, this Confuſion; and remove them ſo, that the <hi>Sap</hi> which had form'd them, nouriſh'd them, and made them grow, may no longer find any

paſſage to riſe up to the ſame place, there to perform the Functions it was us'd to do; but Care muſt be taken that this very <hi>Sap</hi> in its common way, or road, cloſe to the firſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which is ſtopp'd, may find another as good, and as eaſie, ſo that it may be capable of uſing it, and thereby fully to enter into ſome thick adjacent <hi>Branches,</hi> juſt beneath thoſe that have been retrench'd, as it appears by the Figure.</p>
                        <p>And ſo there will be no fear of the growing of any falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Suckers</hi> there, nor of any new Confuſion, which would certainly happen, if, in the firſt place, thoſe thick <hi>Branches</hi> had been cut from the top, over ſome weak ſmall <hi>Branches,</hi> and conſequently incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in their ſmall Mouth all the <hi>Sap</hi> which us'd to enter into thoſe that have been retrench'd.</p>
                        <p>Or, if in the ſecond place, part of the ſaid thick <hi>Branches</hi> of the middle had been left, whereas they ought to have been wholly taken away, or elſe would make a kind of Stump there.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Sap</hi> returning ſtill from the <hi>Foot</hi> with its uſual abundance, and returning through the ſame Channel it was us'd to, either to the <hi>Stem,</hi> or ſome thick <hi>Branch,</hi> and finding no Overture large enough to receive it; or perhaps finding none at all, this <hi>Sap,</hi> I ſay, burſts of neceſſity round about that ſmall <hi>Branch,</hi> over which the thick one was cut off, or elſe round about that <hi>Stump,</hi> or thoſe <hi>Stumps</hi> which were left, and in burſting, makes a great many new <hi>Branches</hi> in that middle, and conſequently forms there the ſame defect we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to Correct.</p>
                        <p>I have ſhown heretofore, that on ſuch Occaſions, there are ſometimes ſome Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroaks to be perform'd, to leave for a certain time a thick <hi>Branch</hi> over another thick <hi>Branch,</hi> which muſt be taken away; to the end that, as in the Caſe of Fountains, which are ſometies vented, leſt the Winds might hinder the Water from performing its Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as it ought to do, a conſiderable part of <hi>Sap</hi> may be waſted into thoſe kind of thick uſeleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> which otherwiſe would ruine ſome diſpoſitions for <hi>Fruit,</hi> ready form'd, or others which might form themſelves: But after the <hi>Tree</hi> ſeems to perform its duty in relation to <hi>Fruit,</hi> we may without any ſcruple wholly take away ſuch thick <hi>Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> that are of no uſe for the Figure, and have only been left two or three years to waſte, as we have ſaid, an abundance of <hi>Sap</hi> which would have been troubleſom to us: Beſides, the Overture of the <hi>Tree</hi> being made by means of ſome thick <hi>Branches</hi> that has been taken out of the middle: It will be fit next to examine the remaining <hi>Branches,</hi> whether good, that is, grown according to the moſt common Order of Nature, or bad, being grown contrary to the ſaid Order; and conſequently <hi>Branches</hi> of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> in order to preſerve as many as can be of the firſt, which may be uſeful for <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Fruit,</hi> at the ſame time, aſſigning to each the length that may be proper for it, thereby to ruine the Ill ones, all, if the Beauty of the Figure requires it, conformably to the Idea we ſhall have form'd of it, or only part, which may happen when ſome thick one chances to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently well plac'd to contribute to that Figure, which without it would prove imperfect.</p>
                        <p>As for the third defect, which relates to the roundneſs, it is not ſo eaſily remedy'd, as the foregoing; it proceeds from that, when the <hi>Dwarf</hi> was firſt form'd, Care was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to order the Matter ſo, that the Head of the <hi>Tree</hi> might at leaſt be compos'd of two <hi>Branches,</hi> partly of an equal ſtrength, or thickneſs, the one on one ſide, the other on the other, to keep the Vigour of it in ſome meaſure divided, or as it were in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> (when there happen to be three or four, the thing is yet eaſier.)</p>
                        <p>But yet, two may be ſufficient to that end, by reaſon that, as we have ſaid, each of them being afterwards <hi>Prun'd,</hi> as it ought to be, will ſhoot others on the Extremity of it upon the ſides, which others being likewiſe <hi>Prun'd,</hi> will in their turn likewiſe ſhoot others.</p>
                        <p>And thus, from year to year, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> ſtill performing a new <hi>Pruning,</hi> good new <hi>Branches</hi> will ſtill form themſelves, which will contribute to form, and afterwards preſerve in our <hi>Trees</hi> that agreeable roundneſs, and that abundance of fine <hi>Fruit</hi> we deſire.</p>
                        <p>This defect in the roundneſs, probably proceeds then from that the <hi>Tree</hi> when it was firſt Planted, having at the beginning only produc'd one thick <hi>Branch</hi> on one ſide, with a weak one on the oppoſite ſide, as it appears by the Figure; the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> inſtead of looking at firſt on that thick <hi>Branch</hi> as the only one, capable of forming a ſine Head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method I have preſcrib'd for the Conduct of thoſe kind of <hi>Trees,</hi> when they are newly Planted; inſtead of that, I ſay, has indifferently cut both this thick one, and at the ſame time, this other ſmall one, leaving them perhaps each of an equal length, without any Proſpect as to the Figure, which I hold neceſſary, and thus the ſtrength of the <hi>Sap</hi> ſtill continuing its firſt road, which inclines it only to the thick <hi>Branch,</hi> ſtill produces many new fine ones on that ſide; and, whereas there enters but a very inconſiderable quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> in the ſmall Neighbouring <hi>Branch,</hi> tho' it grew at the ſame time with the thick one, ſo it produces but a very ſmall number of ſmall new <hi>Branches,</hi> which periſh ſoon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48210:171"/>
after; that is, perhaps, after having born a little <hi>Fruit:</hi> Thus one ſide grows ſtill in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, being extreamly well furniſh'd, while the other remains weak, languiſhing, and thin; and conſequently the <hi>Tree</hi> being only well on one ſide, makes a very ugly Figure, half flat, and half round, not in the leaſt anſwering the Figure that is requir'd in a <hi>Tree</hi> to be perfect, either in it ſelf, or for the pleaſure of ſight.</p>
                        <p>From thence it is eaſie to judge that this defect in point of roundneſs is great, and even <note place="margin">Bonum ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrâ cauſâ; malum ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet defectu.</note> difficult to Correct, at leaſt to be Corrected in few years; however, provided the <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> takes Care in <hi>Pruning,</hi> as he eaſily may, to order it ſo, that yearly the thick <hi>Branch</hi> he <hi>Prunes</hi> may produce ſome other likewiſe thick, ſhooting towards the ſide that wants filling, furniſhing, and being made round; he may in time, in ſome meaſure attain to that round Figure.</p>
                        <p>Now, in order to underſtand how this may be perform'd with a little Cate and Forecaſt, it is fit to remember, that, as we have already ſaid, every <hi>Branch</hi> being <hi>Prun'd,</hi> muſt of neceſſity ſhoot ſome new ones on the Extremity of it, and that more or leſs, according to its thickneſs, and ſtrength, and the length that has been allow'd to it: A thick, ſtrong, and ſhort one producing commonly a greater quantity, and thoſe finer than either the thick and ſtrong one that has been left long, or the weak one, whatever way it was <hi>Prun'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that it is moſt true, that it is poſſible to <hi>Prune</hi> in ſuch a manner, from year to year, that among the thick new <hi>Branches</hi> (that are to come, and are to grow out of thoſe <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> that are on the Extremity of the Old one that has been <hi>Prun'd)</hi> there may always be ſome Principal one, ſhooting toward the defective ſide, which conſequently muſt be carefully preſerv'd, and <hi>Prun'd</hi> alſo with the ſame regards, and thus this defect diminiſhing by degrees, the Perfection of roundneſs, which is wanting in the Figure, will be inſenſibly Introduc'd.</p>
                        <p>In Correcting the third Defect of this <hi>Dwarf,</hi> the fourth is Corrected at the ſame time, which conſiſts in not being equally furniſh'd round about its Circumference; ſo that this <hi>Dwarf</hi> in loſing the Defect it had in wanting of roundneſs, at the ſame time acquires the fourth Perfection it ought to have, that is, it becomes as full on one ſide, as it was on the other.</p>

                           <p>The Defects of <hi>Pruning,</hi> in Relation to Old <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE muſt impute the Defects of <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> to the ſame Canſe, which is a failure in the firſt years againſt the ſame Principles of <hi>Pruning,</hi> which had been tranſgreſs'd in the forming of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and has now been Corrected by us: That which hinder'd the roundneſs of thoſe, is abſolutely the ſame thing with that which has hinder'd the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of that equality of ſtrength, without which the ſides of a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> cannot be equally furniſh'd.</p>
                        <p>That is, the <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> muſt have produc'd the firſt year, ſome <hi>Branches</hi> equally ſtrong, oppoſite one to another; or if it has ſhot but one ſtrong one, the whole Beauty of the <hi>Tree</hi> muſt be founded alone upon that, without truſting to the weak ones that are grown at the ſame time for any thing, but <hi>Fruit,</hi> and then their Death.</p>
                        <p>This ſingle thick one, being at the Spring <hi>Prun'd</hi> ſomewhat ſhort, that is, within five or ſix Inches, ſeldom fails, as we have ſaid, of Producing that very year at leaſt two thick ones, with ſome ſmall ones; which two thick ones will be partly of an equal ſtrength, and oppos'd to each other.</p>
                        <p>Now each of them having a ſide to fill, will perform it well, provided the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> ſtill remains Maſter of the Extremity of them, ſo as not to let either ſlip up, as we have fully explain'd in the Conduct of our young <hi>Wall-Trees;</hi> and conſequently this <hi>Wall-Fruit-Tree</hi> is commonly only defective by the Negligence, or rather want of Skill of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who being intruſted with the Conduct thereof, has not had all the Regards we have explain'd in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of thick <hi>Branches:</hi> And therefore, whereas he may have been deficient for many years together in thoſe <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> againſt the good Principles of <hi>Pruning;</hi> it follows, that to repair the Defects of them, there are as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies to be fear'd, as we have demonſtrated, in order to the repairing of thoſe of a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> being ſhot too high.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48210:171"/>
When the <hi>Trees</hi> are not too Old, I am for <hi>ſhort'ning</hi> the thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhot up within two or three years, as well in the Caſe of Kernel, as of Stone-<hi>Fruit;</hi> thoſe thick <hi>Branches</hi> being <hi>ſhort'ned,</hi> will produce new ones on their Extremities, which will begin a-new to form the agreeable Figure <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> ought to have; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that Figure, will not only bear abundance of <hi>Fruit,</hi> but will bear long, which thoſe kind of <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> ſhot up too high cannot perform, the common heighth of the Walls not allowing it: And as for thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> that are Older, perhaps ſome thick <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> may be <hi>ſhort'ned,</hi> which Expedient is pretty ſecure in all ſort of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> excepting <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> being <hi>Graff'd;</hi> for it is certain, that <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> growing from a Stone, live much longer than others, but then they do not bear <hi>Fruit</hi> ſo ſoon; but in recompence, being Cut again, they ſtill ſhoot Vigorouſly, which the others that have been <hi>Graff'd</hi> do not do, being Old, Infirm, and Weak, at the end of Ten or Twelve years: This is the reaſon why they can hardly ſhoot any new <hi>Branches</hi> through the hard dry Bark of an old <hi>Branch</hi> that ſhall have been ſhorten'd upon them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in my Opinion, the beſt way is to leave thoſe Old <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are, without Performing the Grand Remedy upon them, which is to ſhorten them; only <hi>Pruning</hi> them as if they were well-Condition'd, in order to get <hi>Fruit</hi> from them, as long as they are capable of affording ſuch as is Good, and Fair, with a Reſolve to deſtroy them as ſoon as they ceaſe to bear ſuch. In the mean time, I think it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to remove the Earth from the ſides, which I believe may be waſted; at the ſame time taking away the greateſt part of the Old <hi>Roots</hi> that may be found in moving of the Earth, putting afterwards good new Mould in the room of it, then Plant new <hi>Trees</hi> there, that may be young, and fine, and of the Choiceſt <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the other kind of <hi>Trees</hi> that have been Stock'd up, or Shorten'd, either <hi>Pear, Fig, Abricot,</hi> or <hi>Plumb-Trees,</hi> their new <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be order'd according to the Rules heretofore Eſtabliſh'd in the management of young <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> which without doubt will ſucceed well.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Defect of a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> being Corrected, which, as we have ſaid, conſiſts in not being ſo well garniſh'd with good <hi>Branches</hi> on the ſides, as to have an equality without the leaſt appearance of Confuſion; The Second, which conſiſts in having thick <hi>Branches</hi> ſhot up too high, being but a Sequel of the firſt, or rather the ſame thing, will conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be Corrected by the ſame means.</p>
                        <p>The thick <hi>Branches</hi> which a Negligent or Unskillful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> has ſuffer'd to grow too long, have occaſion'd all this diſorder, for want of Conſidering, that whereas the New <hi>Branches</hi> commonly grow only on the Extremity of thoſe that have been <hi>Prun'd,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on the lower part; it follows of Courſe, that the lower part of ſuch as have been left too long of a Foot and an half, and more, muſt needs from a great Vacuity, or Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſequently ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> having been thus ill order'd, can never acquire the Beauty a <hi>Wall-Tree</hi> ought to have, to be effectually in a good Caſe.</p>
                        <p>As for the next Defect, which conſiſts in having one part Confuſe, that is, too full, while the other wants fullneſs; it commonly proceeds, either from Old, Small, Wither'd, Uſeleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> left by the Ignorant, or Negligent <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> or elſe from having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd and Cut two, three, or four thick <hi>Branches</hi> cloſe by one another, of an equal length, contrary to a good Maxim which forbids it; it being certain, that ſince every <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Prun'd,</hi> produces new ones, and often many; it being certain, I ſay, that if many Cut <hi>Branches</hi> be left near one another, ſeveral New ones will of Courſe ſhoot from them, which not finding empty places enough to fill up, will cauſe a Confuſion where they are, while another part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> to which that <hi>Sap</hi> might have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, which occaſions a great Defect here, becomes wretched, and forſaken, and as it were ſtarves.</p>
                        <p>The Rule which forbids this multiplicity of Thick Neighbouring <hi>Branches</hi> of an equal length, wills one only to be left in every Part, and that of a moderate length; to the end that the New ones it will produce, may ſeverally Garniſh ſome Places, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly without this Forecaſt, might prove empty, and thin: And in Caſe it be thought fit in one place, to leave two or three in proportion, as it proves more or leſs Vigorous, or Thin in that place, they muſt all differ exceedingly in length, and look on different ſides, which may require being Garniſh'd; to the end that the new ones that are to grow, may cauſe a good Effect, inſtead of being cumberſom, ſo as to force one to take them away as ſoon as they are grown.</p>
                        <p>I have now declar'd in General what I think proper to Remedy by <hi>Pruning,</hi> the Grand Defects that are happen'd, and ſtill happen daily in Old <hi>Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>

There now remains to tell, what I think proper to Remedy the Inconveniences that are like to befall Old <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may be ſufficiently known by the Remarks I have juſt made, without any neceſſity of ſaying more preciſely, that it is neceſſary betimes to eſtabliſh the equality of Vigour, which being once ſo eſtabliſh'd, muſt be preſerv'd; and above all things, it is fit to be diffident of thick <hi>Branches,</hi> which never fail of Uſurping a Maſtery wherever they begin to form themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The Truth is, that theſe are the only ones that ſpoil all, by the ill uſe that is made <note place="margin">Non nunquam in Arbore unus ramus c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the firſt thing to be done, is to Examine at firſt, whether the <hi>Tree</hi> be Conformable to the Idea of Beauty it ought to have, and muſt be very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; or if not, in the firſt Caſe, 'tis but following what is Eſtabliſh'd for young <hi>Trees;</hi> but particularly, when they ſeem to ſwerve from a fine Figure, Care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to oppoſe it with Vigour, and Exactneſs: So that if one ſide ſeems to weaken, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours muſt be us'd to ſtrengthen it again, by retrenching ſome thick <hi>Branches</hi> that are ſuperiour to it; that is, when the Condition of the <hi>Tree</hi> can permit it: For as one ſide never weakens conſiderably, without the others ſtrengthning at the ſame time, as ſoon as it is obſerv'd that the other ſide ſeems to ſtrengthen in an extraordinary manner; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſome <hi>Branch</hi> ſhall have thicken'd Conſiderably, and have produc'd a great number of others, that thick one muſt immediately be Cut off, over one looking on the weaker ſide, thereby going to the Exteriour Source of that Defect, and ſtopping it, even in the Original; and ſo Conſequently, whether one <hi>Branch</hi> only, or more, ſhoot out too much, the current of the <hi>Sap</hi> is turn'd aſide; and whereas that <hi>Sap</hi> muſt of neceſſity have a Courſe, if it be ſtop'd on one ſide, it will incline to another, and by thus dividing it, we contribute to the equality of Vigour, without which, a <hi>Tree</hi> can never have the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Figure that is proper to it, and which we ought to Endeavour to procure.</p>
                        <p>This is for the preſent all I have to ſay in Relation to the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> either <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees:</hi> Let us now proceed to the <hi>Vine,</hi> which is not near ſo long, or difficult to Explain.</p>

                        <p>OF all the things the Art of <hi>Husbandry</hi> ſubjects to <hi>Pruning,</hi> and are commonly <hi>Prun'd</hi> once a year; nothing to me ſeems to require it ſo much as <hi>Vines,</hi> and nothing more eaſily Perform'd: Both which Propoſitions I am perſwaded of, and will prove hereafter. In the mean time, I may ſay by the by, that Earth hardly nouriſhes any thing that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to more Accidents, or is oftner afflicted, than a <hi>Vine;</hi> but then, on the other ſide, I may likewiſe affirm, that nothing on Earth would be happier in its Productions, if the wiſhes of Men could Preſerve it from all manner of Misfortunes. It will not be proper to make the Apology of it here, it not being the deſign of this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> it is daily ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prais'd by others: And tho' I were ſo minded, I could hardly ſay any thing in favour of it, that were not tireſom.</p>
                        <p>The Proof of my firſt Propoſition is grounded upon this, That conſtantly a <hi>Vine</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be <hi>Prun'd,</hi> Periſhes ſoon after; not in relation to the Foot, which works as it us'd to do, without regard to what relates to the Head, but in relation to the <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſince it neither produces any ſo good, ſo fine, or ſo well fed, as that which is regularly <hi>Prun'd,</hi> by reaſon that (Lively and Sprightly as it is, perhaps beyond any Plant we are acquainted with) when it is well, it commonly ſhoots <hi>Wood</hi> furiouſly, even ſeveral <hi>Branches</hi> in one Summer, and thoſe thick enough, each five or ſix Fathom long, every one of thoſe ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time a vaſt number of bad ſmall <hi>Branches</hi> all along the thick ones, which is a thing ſufficiently known by every body.</p>

of <hi>Sap,</hi> which might be imploy'd to produce <hi>Fruit;</hi> therefore it is fit to avoid that great quantity of uſeleſs <hi>Branches</hi> upon <hi>Vines,</hi> which can be done no otherwiſe than by <hi>Pruning,</hi> and conſequently it is abſolutely neceſſary to <hi>Prune</hi> a <hi>Vine;</hi> inſomuch, that it is leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious for a <hi>Vine</hi> to be ill <hi>Prun'd,</hi> than not <hi>Prun'd</hi> at all: For at leaſt this <hi>Pruning,</hi> tho' ill perform'd, occaſions a great benefit, in hindring the <hi>Sap</hi> from waſting, or being diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, as it would be in the long <hi>Branches</hi> that we retrench in <hi>Pruning,</hi> it producing at the ſame time other <hi>Branches</hi> from the <hi>Foot,</hi> which will prove more uſeful: From whence it follows, that in our <hi>Husbandry</hi> nothing requires ſo much being <hi>Prun'd</hi> as a <hi>Vine;</hi> and indeed, as we have already obſerv'd, we ſtand indebted to the <hi>Vine</hi> for the firſt beginnings of <hi>Pruning,</hi> which is now practis'd ſo uſefully by <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> and <hi>Vine-Dreſſers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Reaſon which made me affirm, that nothing appears ſo eaſie to be <hi>Prun'd</hi> as a <hi>Vine,</hi> (and this is my ſecond Propoſition) is, that in my Opinion nothing puniſhes the Defects that are committed in <hi>Pruning</hi> leſs than a <hi>Vine</hi> does. We have daily a thouſand Examples of it in common <hi>Vineyards,</hi> where we ſeldom meet a <hi>Vine-Dreſſer</hi> Skillful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to underſtand the true method of <hi>Pruning</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> and conſequently of giving a good Reaſon for what he does; and yet thoſe very <hi>Vine-Dreſſers</hi> ſeldom fail of having yearly a pretty good <hi>Vintage,</hi> provided the Seaſons do not hinder it.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Vines,</hi> tho' ill <hi>Prun'd,</hi> provided the <hi>Foot</hi> be in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, do not fail of producing abundance of fine <hi>Wood,</hi> and conſequently a great deal of <hi>Fruit;</hi> therefore I had reaſon to ſay, that nothing is more eaſie to <hi>Prune</hi> than a <hi>Vine:</hi> For indeed, whereas the <hi>Roots</hi> of it are extreamly Active, they produce abundance of <hi>Sap,</hi> which of Courſe makes a great many large new <hi>Branches,</hi> eſpecially upon thoſe that have been <hi>Prun'd</hi> the year before. Every one of thoſe new <hi>Branches</hi> commonly ſhoots <hi>Fruit</hi> on the fifth and ſixth <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> and even pretty often on the ſeventh; and that which is ſingular in a <hi>Vine,</hi> is, that it produces its <hi>Fruit</hi> at the ſame time with the <hi>Branches;</hi> for the <hi>Fruit</hi> does not grow afterwards here, as it does on the <hi>Branches</hi> of other <hi>Fruit-</hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Plants:</hi> And indeed, no <hi>Fruit</hi> muſt be expected on a <hi>Vine,</hi> unleſs it comes out at the ſame moment with the <hi>Branches,</hi> which is a truth known by every body.</p>
                        <p>Commonly every good new <hi>Branch</hi> produces at leaſt two fine Bunches of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which ſeldom fails; and this furniſhes a pretty conſiderable quantity of Wine; but when every <hi>Branch,</hi> or at leaſt the Major part produces Three, which happens ſometimes, then we have a full <hi>Vintage;</hi> ſuppoſing always, that neither Hail, Froſt, or bad Rains, eſpecially thoſe, which falling at the time of the <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> make the <hi>Grapes</hi> run; I ſay, ſuppoſing thoſe Enemies to <hi>Vines</hi> have ſpoil'd nothing in its Productions.</p>
                        <p>I need not mention in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> the manner of Planting, or Multiplying it; for beſides that, it is not a proper place for it, nothing can be more generally known, than thoſe two Articles are: So that I ſhall only inſiſt upon the <hi>Pruning</hi> part, which I look upon to be very neceſſary, by reaſon of four or five ſorts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> that are commonly introduc'd in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> and are indeed the Chief Adornments of them, I mean <hi>Muſcadins,</hi> which are the moſt Conſiderable; the others are <hi>Chaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Precoſes,</hi> or early <hi>Grapes, Currans,</hi> even <hi>Bourdelais</hi> not being excluded; not indeed for the ſame Reaſons proper to the others, but for the Reaſons explain'd in that part, which Treats of the good uſe that is to be made of the Walls of every <hi>Garden;</hi> and ſhews that <hi>Bourdelais</hi> are uſeful both for <hi>Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Verjuice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall begin this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> by ſaying, that among the good <hi>Grapes,</hi> which Compoſe part of our <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> and the common <hi>Grapes</hi> that grow in <hi>Vineyards,</hi> there is particularly this great difference; that in our <hi>Gardens</hi> we neither require abundance of Bunches, or abundance of <hi>Grapes</hi> upon thoſe Bunches; we deſire thin Bunches, with few <hi>Grapes</hi> upon them, provided they be large, firm, and crackling; to the end that the Seaſon for Maturity being favourable, we may have the pleaſure we had propos'd to our ſelves; which never happens when the <hi>Grapes</hi> are too cloſe; whereas in <hi>Vineyards</hi> they have different Proſpects, and with reaſon, deſiring nothing ſo much, as the abundance of Bunches, and quantity of <hi>Grapes</hi> upon each of them.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, moreover, that a good and well amended Soil is not proper to produce good <hi>Grapes</hi> in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> eſpecially for <hi>Muſcadins;</hi> we rather want a Soil moderately fat, provided it be not too much worn, and be well ſituated; and laſtly, provided the <hi>Plants</hi> are neither too old, nor too young; And, in caſe they be very Vigorous, not too cloſe one to another, ſo as to cauſe a Confuſion; all which Conditions are very neceſſary for the goodneſs of <hi>Muſcadin,</hi> and without doubt to contribute conſiderably to it, nothing can be of more uſe, than a Skillful <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48210:173"/>
In Order to Perform it skillfully, we are to Examine two Principal Things; firſt, the Vigour of the whole <hi>Plant</hi> that is to be <hi>Prun'd;</hi> and ſecondly, the Thickneſs or Strength of every <hi>Branch</hi> upon which the <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be perform'd; for as to the time of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> nothing is to be added to what has been ſaid of the time of the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> ſince all the ſame Conſiderations are to be had in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> as have been had in the <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the firſt Point in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vigour of the <hi>Plant</hi> (which is known by the thickneſs, and number of new <hi>Shoots)</hi> the Chief thing to be done, is always to leave a great burthen to thoſe <hi>Plants,</hi> that are very Vigorous; I mean a great many <hi>Prun'd Branches,</hi> whether thoſe <hi>Plants</hi> have as yet but one Arm, as when they are very young, or have many, as they may have after the fifth or ſixth year of their being <hi>Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> But yet, in either Caſe, that great Burthen muſt be ſo well mannag'd, that it may have no Confuſion: And whereas very Vigorous <hi>Plants</hi> muſt be greatly burthen'd, ſo always in proportion, few Cut <hi>Branches</hi> muſt be left upon ſuch as are but moderately ſtrong, and yet leſs upon thoſe that are very weak.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſecond Point, which relates to the thickneſs of every <hi>Branch</hi> upon which the <hi>Pruning</hi> is to be Perform'd; always ſuppoſing the regards I adviſe for the beſt Plac'd, which I will explain in the Sequel. That being done, I am always for <hi>Pruning</hi> upon the thickeſt <hi>Branches,</hi> which indeed are the beſt; at leaſt it muſt never be perform'd upon the Weak ones; ſo that if the <hi>Trimming</hi> of the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uſeleſ <hi>Branches,</hi> that is neceſſary to be done yearly in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> had not taken away abundance of ſmall <hi>Shoots</hi> that commonly grow upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> or upon ſome Old <hi>Branch,</hi> they muſt be remov'd at the time of <hi>Pruning,</hi> weak <hi>Shoots</hi> not producing near ſo much as the thick ones.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Branches</hi> to be <hi>Prun'd</hi> being choſen, which, as we have already declar'd, muſt always be the thickeſt, and beſt plac'd, we muſt now regulate the length that is proper to be allow'd to each of them: This Length ought commonly to be limited to four good <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> (which are the four firſt to be reckon'd from the Place whence the <hi>Branch</hi> has taken its Birth) unleſs it be with a deſign to make the <hi>Plant</hi> of that <hi>Vine</hi> riſe all on a ſuddain, or elſe in the ſpace of two or three years, a great deal higher than it is, or elſe to make it garniſh ſome diſtant place, in a ſhort ſpace of time; in which Caſe, it may be allow'd a great deal more length than we have now Regulated; but ſtill on Condition, that when it ſhall once have reach'd that heighth, or propos'd diſtance, it muſt, if it prove well, always be kept to that, as it may be done with eaſe, by means of the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> I Practiſe, only yearly performing that <hi>Pruning,</hi> within the compaſs of the moderate length above mention'd.</p>
                        <p>In the performing of this, as well as all other manners of <hi>Pruning</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> theſe two Precautions muſt be had; both of which are pretty Material: The Firſt is, to Cut within a large Inch of the <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> that is to be the laſt, I mean on the Extremity of the <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Prun'd,</hi> by reaſon that if it were cut cloſer, that <hi>Eye</hi> would be wounded by it, and would not produce ſo fine a <hi>ſhoot:</hi> And the ſecond is, to order the Cut ſo, that the ſlope may always draw towards the ſide that is oppoſite to that laſt <hi>Eye,</hi> for fear the Water, or Bleedings which never fail dropping from that part that is <hi>Prun'd,</hi> when the <hi>Sap</hi> begins to riſe, ſhould fall upon that laſt <hi>Eye,</hi> becauſe it might prove prejudicial to it.</p>
                        <p>From thoſe four <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> left upon the <hi>Pruning</hi> of a Vigorous <hi>Plant,</hi> eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Wall, may always be expected four new <hi>Branches,</hi> one from each; each of which, as we have already ſaid, will be furniſh'd with two or three Bunches of <hi>Grapes;</hi> that is, every good <hi>Branch</hi> being <hi>Prun'd</hi> within the compaſs of four <hi>Eyes,</hi> provided, no ill accident befall either of them, which happens ſometimes, may produce four good new <hi>Branches</hi> together, with eight, ten, or twelve Bunches of <hi>Grapes</hi> for Autumn; ſo that one <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>Vine,</hi> upon which, at the Spring, ſhall have been left two good <hi>Branches Prun'd,</hi> may yield that very year twenty, or twenty four Bunches of <hi>Grapes;</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having four good <hi>Branches,</hi> may yield to the number of forty, and ſo it might riſe <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> always remembring to proportion the burthen in <hi>Pruning,</hi> to the Vigour of the <hi>Plant;</hi> likewiſe noting, that ſuch an abundance can only ſuit with <hi>Vines</hi> Planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Walls.</p>
                        <p>I repeat again, that in <hi>Pruning,</hi> a great difference is to be made between a <hi>Branch</hi> ſhot from the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the preceeding year, and another; for indeed the firſt can only be look'd upon as a <hi>Branch</hi> of falſe <hi>Wood,</hi> and conſequently, muſt be abſolutely remov'd, unleſs there be no other upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> or that it may be of uſe, as it is pretty often, in order to ſhorten the <hi>Stock</hi> cloſe to it, being neceſſitated ſo to do, both to keep within the bounds of the heighth we affect, and becauſe Old <hi>Branches</hi> periſh, in fine, at the end of a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48210:173"/>
certain time, and ſo conſequently the old <hi>Wood</hi> being grown infirm, and uſeleſs, it muſt needs be remov'd, as ſoon as it is perceiveable.</p>
                        <p>Now, ſince for the Reaſons aboveſaid, it has been thought fit to preſerve ſome <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> ſhot from the ſtock, for inſtance, one or two in one and the ſame place; in ſuch a Caſe they muſt be ſhortned within the compaſs of two <hi>Eyes,</hi> in hopes of two fair good <hi>Branches,</hi> upon which we may lay the foundation of our hopes, for the re-eſtabliſhing of ſuch a <hi>Vine,</hi> whether it be the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> or only part of it, continuing during that year the common <hi>Pruning</hi> upon ſome higher <hi>Branch,</hi> in order to have <hi>Fruit</hi> that year, reſolving to ruine it intirely, the <hi>Fruit</hi> being gather'd.</p>
                        <p>We have declar'd elſewhere, that <hi>Muſcadin</hi> requires a pretty deal of heat, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that it dreads the exceſs, as much as the Mediocrity, or want of it: Therefore, as in Moderate Climes, like <hi>France,</hi> Muſcadin requires being plac'd to the South, or at leaſt to the Eaſt, againſt Walls: So in very hot Countries, like <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> it dreads thoſe kind of Scituations, by reaſon that the heat being too ſcorching, the <hi>Grapes</hi> wither, and burn, inſtead of ripening, and therefore only thrive there in the open air, where indeed they attain a miraculous Perfection, inſomuch, that all the Induſtry of Man can never reach that Perfection, in Countries that lye ſomewhat to the <hi>North;</hi> for which Reaſon, we are oblig'd to confeſs, that tho' we need not envy other Climes for all other <hi>Fruits,</hi> viz. <hi>Peaches, Plums, Pears, Apples,</hi> and even <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Melons,</hi> &amp;c. yet in our Climes we can never approach the happineſs of Meridional Countries for <hi>Muſcadins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is to be obſerv'd particularly, that <hi>Muſcadin</hi> never thrives well againſt a high <hi>Treillis,</hi> it is always cloſe, ſmall, and flabby; wherefore I am not for placing it againſt ſuch, neither muſt it (eſpecially in <hi>Eſpaliers)</hi> be kept ſo low that the <hi>Grapes</hi> may touch the ground, or for the water of Spouts to ſpurt gravel againſt it: For which reaſon, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a heighth of three, four, or five foot at moſt, particularly for <hi>Muſcadin,</hi> inſomuch, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> on the <hi>Eſpalier</hi> may neither be much higher, nor much lower; this is what I meant heretofore, when I ſpoke of a <hi>Branch,</hi> which being thick, is fit for <hi>Pruning,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be well plac'd.</p>
                        <p>The ſame heighth is likewiſe very proper for <hi>Chaſſellas, Currans,</hi> and early <hi>Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. but not ſo neceſſary: <hi>Grapes</hi> that do not grow againſt <hi>Walls,</hi> indeed may, and ought to be kept much lower, whatever they be, but ſtill we muſt not ſwerve from the Maxim which forbids that <hi>Grapes</hi> that are to be eaten raw, ſhould touch the ground.</p>
                        <p>The length for the <hi>Pruning</hi> of every <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Vine</hi> being regulated, it will now be proper to examine to the bottom the burthen that is fit to be left upon every <hi>Plant,</hi> which is the moſt difficult, and moſt material Point.</p>
                        <p>When the preceeding years <hi>Pruning</hi> has produc'd three, or four <hi>Branches,</hi> as it may do, and often happens; then ſuppoſing the <hi>Vine</hi> to be of the heighth above-mention'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by removing wholly all the weak ones, and as to the others, unleſs the Mother <hi>Branch,</hi> be very Vigorous, I never preſerve above two of them, and chuſe the thickeſt, becauſe that, as we have already ſaid, they are doubtleſs the beſt, always chuſing, as much as can be, the loweſt, provided they be thick, otherwiſe I keep to the higheſt; after that, I <hi>Prune</hi> them both, tho' not of an equal length, that is, allowing them each four <hi>Eyes,</hi> I only allow it the higheſt of the two, which I call the <hi>Pruning,</hi> and leave but two upon the loweſt, which I call a <hi>Stump;</hi> reſolving at the ſame time, to remove the higheſt quite the following year; together with all thoſe that ſhall ſhoot from it, reducing my ſelf wholly to the two that ſhall grow from that ſhorteſt <hi>Branch,</hi> provided the ſaid <hi>Branch</hi> ſucceeds according to my hopes, and appearances; for if any accident ſhould happen to it, ſo as not to produce two fine <hi>Branches,</hi> it ſhooting perhaps but one, I fix ſtill to the fineſt, and loweſt of the <hi>Pruning,</hi> either to keep two of them, in caſe the ſhort <hi>Branch</hi> has fail'd quite; or at leaſt, I preſerve one for <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> the ſhort one having ſhot one, that may ſerve for a ſhort one the following year: This is the Method I daily attempt, not to ſwerve from the heighth I affect, as good, and neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>I affirm, that by this Method, accompany'd with ſome Culture, and the common Cuſtom of Couching <hi>Branches</hi> from time, to time, in order to get new <hi>Wood,</hi> when the old begins to appear waſted; as alſo with the help of a little <hi>Dung,</hi> or rather ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of <hi>Soil,</hi> when any diminution of Vigour is perceiv'd; I ſay, I affirm that ſuch a Method will conſtantly preſerve every <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>Vine</hi> in a good Caſe, Vigorous, and without any Wounds, it will produce fine <hi>Grapes;</hi> and conſequently, if the Seaſon, and Clime contribute to afford it due Maturity, it will yield the Satisfaction that was expected from it.</p>
                        <p>But when the <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>Vine,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> is extraordinary Vigorous, as it happens pretty often, inſomuch that the three, or four <hi>Branches</hi> it has ſhot from every
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48210:174"/>
                           <hi>Branch</hi> that has been <hi>Prun'd</hi> prove very thick; I am for preſerving of them all, <hi>Pruning</hi> both the one and the others of the Length heretofore ſpecifi'd, as well the higheſt for <hi>Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as the loweſt for a <hi>Stump;</hi> and in order to have room to place without Confuſion all the Young ones that are to proceed from that, I pull up ſome Neighbouring <hi>Plant</hi> that might ſtand in my way: I likewiſe affect ſometimes to chooſe for my <hi>Pruning</hi> the meaneſt of thoſe <hi>Branchss,</hi> always forming my <hi>Stump</hi> upon the loweſt of the thick ones, after which I cut the thickeſt that are near that mean one, that may be fit for <hi>Pruning</hi> within one <hi>Eye;</hi> in order that thoſe kind of <hi>Stumps</hi> may waſt part of the Fury of the <hi>Foot,</hi> and that the mean <hi>Branch</hi> I have choſen for the beſt may not be inconvenienc'd by it, and made to bear Cloſe <hi>Fruit,</hi> as it would certainly do, if it receiv'd the Vigour of all of them; ſo that in ſuch a Caſe, I do not Cut the higheſt over the loweſt, as I uſe to do, when the <hi>Plant</hi> is but moderately Vigorous.</p>
                        <p>When our <hi>Muſcadines</hi> are in <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> the thing in the World I am moſt deſirous of, is, that which, excepting Froſt and Hail, is moſt to be dreaded for <hi>Vines,</hi> and that is Rain, in order to make part of the <hi>Grapes</hi> weep away, without which they would be too cloſe, as well as too ſmall and flabby; therefore when Nature does not allow me that Rain according to my deſire, I endeavour to ſupply it with Waterings, which for the moſt part ſucceeds well: I muſt confeſs that it is very Troubleſome for ſuch as have a great many <hi>Plants</hi> of <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> but yet the Experiment may be try'd upon a ſmaller Number.</p>
                        <p>When the Year proves Extraordinary Drie at the ſeaſon of Maturity, if my Soil be naturally very Drie, I Water the <hi>Foot</hi> of my <hi>Vine</hi> largely, eſpecially when the <hi>Fruit</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to turn; ſuch a Watering, when neceſſary, and well perform'd in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Contributes certainly to the largeneſs and firmneſs of the <hi>Grapes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Fruit-</hi>Bearing <hi>Branch,</hi> I mean the new <hi>Branch</hi> of that Years growth, is not of a Monſtrous thickneſs, as ſome of them prove ſometimes, I Cut it in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> cloſe to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> being careful at the ſame time, by means of ſome Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leaves, to ſhelter the <hi>Fruit</hi> from the great heat of the Sun, until it be at leaſt half ripe; for when it draws near Maturity, and this is a general Rule, it is proper to keep it a little bare, in order to afford it that <hi>Yellow</hi> Colour, which becomes it ſo well: The Cutting I juſt mention'd, augments the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to make it larger, and more crackling, but it is not always certain nor infallible, neither muſt it be done, when the <hi>Branches</hi> are very thick; for whereas in the <hi>Summer</hi> they ſhoot almoſt as many ſmall new <hi>Branches,</hi> as they have <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> growing thick, would in courſe occaſion a great Confuſion, for even when the <hi>Branches</hi> are not ſhortned, they notwithſtanding ſhoot, during the <hi>Summer,</hi> abundance of thoſe <hi>Buds,</hi> which muſt be carefully pull'd off, as being very Uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>Happy are thoſe who are in ſuch Situations, where <hi>Muſcadine</hi> yearly ripens well, I cannot forbear envying their good Fortune a little. Happy likewiſe are thoſe, who having <hi>Muſcadine</hi> in an indifferent Climate, and pretty ill Ground, are favour'd with ſuch a <hi>Summer</hi> as we had in the Year 1676, for it is moſt certain, that we have Reaſon to be contented with that Years <hi>Muſcadine.</hi>

                        <p>But it is not ſufficient for our <hi>Vines</hi> to have abundance of fine <hi>Bunches,</hi> and thoſe not over ſtock'd with <hi>Grapes,</hi> nor for the Seaſon to be favourable to make them Ripen well, we have beſides other conſiderable Enemies to dread for thoſe <hi>Grapes,</hi> as well as for <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> which are, beſides ſome Froſts which make the <hi>Leaves</hi> fall, and long Cold Rains, which Rot the <hi>Grapes;</hi> Birds and Flies of ſeveral kinds; as to the firſt, the firſt, the beſt way to prevent their Miſchief, is to hang Nets before thoſe <hi>Grapes</hi> which will hinder the Birds from coming near it; but that remedy is not very eaſie, when there is abundance of <hi>Muſcadine</hi> to be preſerv'd: As to the Flies, we have the Remedy of Viols, that muſt be half filled with Water mix'd with a little Hony, or Sugar, which Expedient is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known by every Body; thoſe Viols muſt be hung up in divers Places about the <hi>Vines</hi> with ſome Pack-Thread, and thoſe Infects ſeldom fail of getting into them, being attracted by the Sweetneſs of the Honey and Sugar, and there certainly periſh, as ſoon as they are got in, not being able to find the way out again; at leaſt abundance of them are deſtroy'd that way, tho' it is almoſt impoſſible to deſtroy them all: Care muſt be taken beſides, to empty thoſe Viols, when any Conſiderable number of thoſe Flies are taken, otherwiſe no more of them would be taken, the Corruption and Stink they are Subject to, hinder the others from coming there: Then the ſaid Viols muſt be fill'd up again, as before, and plac'd a-new in proper Places.</p>
                        <p>Paper bags, and Linnen Cloths, are likewiſe us'd to cover every <hi>Bunch,</hi> but beſides that it is a kind of Slavery, if on the one ſide it ſerves to preſerve the <hi>Grapes</hi> ſo inclos'd from the Birds and Flies, on the other ſide, it hinders the Sun from affording them that ſame Yellow Colour, which is ſo agreeable to ſight, and Contributes to make them better, as well as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48210:174"/>
to ſhow their perfect Maturity: For to imagine that it preſerves the <hi>Grapes</hi> the longer ripe, is an Error I have experienc'd; The Reaſon is, that <hi>Fruit</hi> begins to Rot, as ſoon as it is throughly Ripe, and even ſometimes before; and as ſoon as one <hi>Grape</hi> is tainted, it ſpoils the next, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I muſt not omit adding, that in ſuch years as produce an infinite quantity of Bunches, as the year 1677. it will be fit to take away part of them in thoſe places where they are too thick, as alſo too thin, thoſe Bunches that appear too cloſe, or too full, as well as to ſhorten on the lower Extremity ſuch as ſeem too long, that Extremity never ripening ſo well, as the Top, which always ripens the beſt of any other part.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould likewiſe add, that no <hi>Grapes</hi> muſt be gather'd, eſpecially <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> until it be perfectly ripe, ſince perfect Maturity is abſolutely neceſſary to afford it that ſweetneſs, and flavour, without which, nothing can be leſs agreeable than <hi>Muſcadin:</hi> But this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhall be compos'd in one of the Chapters of the following Part; wherein I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whatever relates to the maturity of every particular <hi>Fruit.</hi>

                           <p>Concerning the Care that is Requir'd to Pick <hi>Fruits,</hi> when they are too abounding.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WHereas the Intention of our <hi>Culture</hi> is not only to promote fair <hi>Fruit,</hi> but eſpecially to have it fine, and large; hoping thereby, and with Reaſon, that it will be the better for it, goodneſs ſeldom failing to attend Beauty, and Largeneſs of Size: And, whereas neither <hi>Pruning,</hi> nor the <hi>Trimming</hi> of the <hi>Buds,</hi> and uſeleſs <hi>Branches,</hi> the <hi>Tillages,</hi> or <hi>Improvements</hi> of the Ground are always ſufficient to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us this Beauty, and Size; it follows from thence, that there is ſomething elſe to be done, which is that I am to Treat of here.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that when we neither meet with Froſts, or North-Eaſt Winds, at the time that the <hi>Trees Bloſſom,</hi> and the <hi>Fruit</hi> knits; that is, in the Months of <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> I ſay, it is certain, that pretty often in ſome parts of the <hi>Tree</hi> there remains too much <hi>Fruit</hi> for it to be very Beautiful; for in the firſt place, in Relation to <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> whether <hi>Pears,</hi> or <hi>Apples,</hi> it is moſt certain that every <hi>Bud</hi> commonly produces many <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> and conſequently may produce many <hi>Fruits;</hi> that is, to the number of Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond place, as to ſtone <hi>Fruits,</hi> altho' every <hi>Bud,</hi> excepting only plain <hi>Cherries, Morello's,</hi> white and black <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Bigarreaux,</hi> produce but one ſingle <hi>Fruit,</hi> (for indeed, one <hi>Peach-Bud,</hi> and one <hi>Plum-Bud</hi> only produce one <hi>Peach,</hi> and one <hi>Plum,)</hi> yet, as every one of their <hi>Fruit-</hi>bearing <hi>Branches,</hi> is commonly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48210:175"/>
burthened with a great number of <hi>Buds,</hi> all cloſe to one another; it follows, that upon every one of thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> there may remain an exceſſive quantity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame Argument we uſe for the <hi>Buds</hi> of <hi>Kernel-Fruits,</hi> may ſtand good for this; which is, that the more <hi>Fruit</hi> there knits upon one <hi>Bud,</hi> the ſmaller the Portion muſt be; which at the ſhooting out of the <hi>Stalk</hi> out of that <hi>Bud,</hi> diſtributes it ſelf to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual <hi>Fruit;</hi> inſomuch, that if the quantity were leſs, 'tis moſt certain that the Portion of every one of the remaining would be the larger, and conſequently, the <hi>Fruit</hi> being the better fed, would be larger, and commonly better.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe, the more <hi>Fruit</hi> there is upon a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit, Peach, Plum,</hi> or <hi>Apricock-Trees, &amp;c.</hi> the ſmaller is the portion of Nouriſhment, which diſtributes it ſelf to every <hi>Peach,</hi> and every <hi>Apricock,</hi> on ſuch <hi>Branches;</hi> ſo that had there been leſs upon every <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> would certainly have been better fed, and conſequently larger, and commonly better; ſince indeed, it is almoſt impoſſible to have at once Largeneſs, Beauty, and Goodneſs, when there is too much <hi>Fruit,</hi> either upon one and the ſame <hi>Bud,</hi> or upon one and the ſame <hi>Branch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that a Skillful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> who takes care to make his <hi>Trees Bloſſom</hi> (which is in ſome meaſure in his Power to do) it follows, I ſay, that he muſt likewiſe take yet more care to leave no more <hi>Fruit</hi> on every <hi>Tree,</hi> and particularly on every <hi>Bud,</hi> and on every <hi>Branch,</hi> than in proportion to what he may judge, that the <hi>Tree,</hi> or rather the <hi>Branch,</hi> is capable to Nouriſh, in order to have that <hi>Fruit</hi> Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, particularly the <hi>Branch;</hi> for, whereas the diſtribution of the Nouriſhment which is deſtin'd to every one, is perform'd at the firſt entrance of the <hi>Branch,</hi> according to the largeneſs of the Overture thereof, and not according to the multitude of the <hi>Fruit</hi> it is burthen'd with, nor the meaſure of Nouriſhment it may ſtand in need of; it follows, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> of every one only receives the benefit of that which Nature allows the <hi>Branch</hi> it grows on, without receiving the leaſt benefit of that which it allows the Neighbouring <hi>Branches,</hi> every one of them having their peculiar Functions, and ſeparated Works, which is ſo certain, that a <hi>Tree</hi> ſometimes bearing but one or two <hi>Fruits,</hi> or at leaſt, but a ſmall quantity, that <hi>Fruit</hi> is no finer than if it had produc'd a far greater quantity.</p>
                        <p>It likewiſe follows from thence, that the encreaſe of <hi>Sap,</hi> or Nouriſhment, which may happen to every individual <hi>Fruit,</hi> only proceeds from the retrenchment that is made of the too great quantity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which grew on every <hi>Bud,</hi> or upon the ſame <hi>Branch</hi> upon which it is found; as if every <hi>Bud,</hi> or every particular <hi>Fruit-Branch</hi> made particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, having every one their particular Income, and each their Servants to nouriſh; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that as the one receives no benefit from the abundance of the others, ſo the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of every one in particular, have a greater ſhare of nouriſhment; when the ſame food, which, for Example, might have been divided, or ſhar'd among Ten, is only divided among Two or Three.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is certain, that we muſt leave but few <hi>Fruits</hi> upon every <hi>Bud,</hi> and upon every <hi>Branch,</hi> if we deſign to have them all both larger and finer; and whereas in <hi>Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> every <hi>Tree,</hi> I leave as many, and ſometimes more good <hi>Buds,</hi> and good <hi>Fruit-Bearing-Branches</hi> upon it, than it ſeems capable to Nouriſh, being ſenſible of the hazards that are to be fear'd, before the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every one are ſafe; and being likewiſe deſirous that all the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> ſhould be partly equally Beautiful, I never fail, after the <hi>Fruit</hi> is knit, to make an exact review of that which every <hi>Bud</hi> and every <hi>Branch</hi> contains, in order to leave no more on each Place, than it is likely to be able to Nouriſh plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe certain, that, pretty often, Nature ſeems to take care to purge, or disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it ſelf of what it is over-burthen'd with; at leaſt the <hi>Spring</hi> ſometimes produces of thoſe Froſts, and <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> Winds, we have already mention'd, which happen alſo pretty often between the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt;</hi> thoſe kind of <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> Winds are Terrible ſhakers of <hi>Fruits;</hi> they beat down abundance of it, and ſome times too much, and that without the leaſt diſcretion or meaſure, either in reſpect to the whole <hi>Tree,</hi> or to Every <hi>Branch,</hi> in ſo much that ſuch years have a great Scarcity of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and often to Exceſs; But yet whatever Misfortune it may have caus'd, we muſt not fail ſtill to make a review of what is remaining, to take away ſuch from ſome Places, which in Prudence we Judge to be overburthen'd.</p>
                        <p>But then again, thoſe Froſts and Stormy Winds do not always happen, and then the greateſt part of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> which has knit, remains upon the <hi>Trees,</hi> and thus in the midſt of Plenty, as to Number, we may really call our ſelves poor as to Beauty, and goodneſs, having nothing fine enough to Honour our Culture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48210:176"/>
In ſuch a Caſe, I think it very proper, to eaſe Nature of a Couſiderable part of its Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, in the following manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is fit to tarry, until the <hi>Fruits</hi> be pretty large and well form'd, in order to take away ſuch as are ſuperabundant, and particularly to preſerve the moſt Beautiful and moſt ſizeable; ſince that great Number conſiſts both of good and bad, to which end we muſt commonly tarry until the end of <hi>May,</hi> and the begining of <hi>June,</hi> at which time <hi>Fruit</hi> is large enough to facilitate our Choice.</p>
                        <p>But this Picking or Culling muſt be Perform'd ſooner for <hi>Apricocks</hi> than any other <hi>Fruits:</hi> Whereby we derive an advantage, which is not met with on other <hi>Trees,</hi> a very good uſe being made of ſmall green <hi>Apricocks,</hi> which we cannot make of other ſmall green <hi>Fruits,</hi> at leaſt hitherto we have not found the way of it, tho it were perhaps to be wiſh'd we might.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt be careful to allow every <hi>Fruit,</hi> as near as we can, as much Room as it may require, for the ſize we know it is to be of, when it approaches to Maturity, and that particularly for thoſe kind of Principal Stone-<hi>Fruits,</hi> which have ſhort Stalks, <hi>viz. Peaches, Pavies,</hi> or <hi>Purple-Peaches, Apricocks,</hi> &amp;c. otherwiſe they would obſtruct each other in growing, and it often happens that thoſe that are equally large deſtroy each other, or at leaſt the ſtrongeſt get the better, that is, the largeſt deſtroys the ſmalleſt, and thus the Nouriſhment which thoſe Wretches have receiv'd during two or three Months, is loſt in vain; whereas it might have been imploy'd to advantage, had care been taken to take off ſome of thoſe that were worſt plac'd betimes; for by that means thoſe that ſhould have been preſerv'd, would have receiv'd the benefit of the Nouriſhment which was waſted on their Neighbours.</p>
                        <p>It follows from thence, that you muſt never leave thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' they are Commonly ſo, ſeveral of them growing together, witneſs <hi>Apricocks,</hi> or at leaſt two and two, witneſs <hi>Peaches:</hi> For commonly the <hi>Bloſſom Buds</hi> of <hi>Peach Trees</hi> only grow two and two, both very cloſe to one another, being only divided by a ſmall <hi>Eye,</hi> for <hi>Wood,</hi> which is a ſmall beginning of a <hi>Branch,</hi> which Places it ſelf between the Two, and for the generality only ſhoots a few Leaves, and no <hi>Wood;</hi> but when it ſhoots Vigorouſly and Forms a pretty fair <hi>Branch,</hi> then there is no neceſſity of remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> which on both ſides accompany the <hi>Branch;</hi> their Natural Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on keeping them at ſufficient diſtance, and without doubt both of them will prove very Fine, provided nothing elſe preſs them while they are thickning, which as I have ſaid, muſt be carefully look'd to; but in caſe the <hi>Shoot</hi> be but weak, and ſlender, it muſt not hinder the removing of one of the two <hi>Peaches:</hi> Moreover, as thoſe kind of ſmall <hi>Shoots</hi> are commonly at a ſtand even in <hi>June,</hi> it is very proper to ſhorten them at that very time to an <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> in order to ſave the Nouriſhment, which would be waſted in them to no purpoſe; beſides thoſe are the <hi>Shoots</hi> which generally cauſe a Confuſion; it will ſuffice to leave a Leaf or two upon each, to ſhelter the <hi>Peach</hi> from the Heat of the Sun, and that during all the time, of it's Tendereſt Infancy; Shade being ſo very neceſſary at that time, that without it the <hi>Peach</hi> might periſh, being uncover'd, before its being come to ſome Maturity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter Pears,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as are recommendable for the largeneſs of their Size, for inſtance, <hi>Beurre</hi> or <hi>Butter-Pears, Bon Chretiens, Virgoulee,</hi> &amp;c. do likewiſe ſtand in need of that Picking or culling of <hi>Fruits;</hi> by reaſon that too many of them being left together upon one Knob, they will ſeldom prove very fine, one will ſuffice upon each, or two at moſt, and even thoſe muſt appear pretty large, according to the Seaſon, and both of an equal Size, for the one being leſs than the other, will always remain ſo, and conſequently ill favour'd, which far from deſerving to be preſerv'd, ſince it could not attain the Size it ought to have, only ſerves to wrong the other, which would have thriven the better had it remain'd alone upon that <hi>Bud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Summer Pears,</hi> for inſtance ſmall <hi>Muſcat, Robins, Caſſolets, Rouſſelets,</hi> &amp;c. there is no ſuch abſolute neceſſity to Pick them, they muſt only be us'd like <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cherries;</hi> they are <hi>Fruits</hi> of an Ordinary and Regular Size, and are commonly good of all Sizes, provided they be Ripe, and not tainted by Worms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It muſt be noted, that, when the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> upon which in <hi>Pruning</hi> we have left as many <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> as we thought fit, which, as we have already noted, is always to ſome Kind of exceſs; when thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> I ſay, do not appear in the Month of <hi>May</hi> to receive Conſiderable Succors of new <hi>Sap,</hi> ſo as to thicken, or to ſhoot fine <hi>Branches</hi> on their extremities: In that Caſe, as I have declared more at large in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48210:176"/>
Treatiſe of <hi>Pruning,</hi> we muſt not only take away a great part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> which is aready knit upon them, but even ſhorten the <hi>Branch</hi> extreamly, and that to that part from which the fineſt <hi>Shoot</hi> proceeds; for otherwiſe certainly the beſt part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> would drop before its being Ripe, or at leaſt would remain very ſmall, and Conſequently bad, it being moſt certain, eſpecially as to Stone <hi>Fruit,</hi> that unleſs they approach to that Size which is proper to their kind, they never attain the delicacy they ought to have. The <hi>Peaches</hi> remain Shaggy and Green, and do not quit the ſtone; they are Sowriſh, and Bitteriſh, the <hi>Pulp</hi> is Rough and Courſe, and often Mealy, the Stone is much larger than it ſhould be, all which are certain Marks of an ill <hi>Peach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Pears</hi> which remain in too great a Number, are apt not only to hinder each other from thickning, but likewiſe to Rot, the Air and the Wind not having a free paſſage about them; this Inconveniency is ſufficient to Inform us, that part of them muſt be taken away, that the remainder may be at more Liberty and Eaſe.</p>
                        <p>In my Opinion, it is very neceſſary to Obſerve in this Place, that it is abſolutely neceſſary, eſpecially in relation to <hi>Winter Bon Chreſtien Pears,</hi> in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> which is the time in which they begin to appear Knit and <hi>Form'd,</hi> to be greatly Careful to deſtroy ſmall Black Caterpillars which are very numorous at that Seaſon, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would gnaw the Rind of thoſe <hi>Pears,</hi> which is the Reaſon we often meet with them crooked and uneven.</p>

                           <p>To Learn to uncover, at a proper Time, certain <hi>Fruits</hi> which require it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FRUITS</hi> being thus pick'd upon every <hi>Tree,</hi> they thicken by degrees under the Leaf, ſome more, others leſs, every one according to its kind, ſome ſooner and others later, each according to the time Nature has deſign'd for their Maturity; but whereas the Red, or Carnation Colour are neceſſary to certain <hi>Fruits,</hi> which may receive it, if not hinder'd, or not have it if hinder'd, (for there are ſome which abſolutely can never attain it, what ever may be done, for Inſtance, <hi>White Peaches, Verte Longue,</hi> or <hi>Long-Green, Green Sugar Pears, White Figs,</hi> &amp;c. there are likewiſe others, which, thonever ſo cover'd, ever receives the Colour of their Kind, for example <hi>Cherries, Rasberries, Strawberries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Whereas, I ſay, Colour as to certain <hi>Fruits,</hi> is a very material condition, in order to render them the more valuable, and that they can never attain that Colour in Ripening, unleſs the Rays of the Sun light directly upon them, it is proper at certain times to remove ſome <hi>Leaves</hi> which ſhade them too much, and conſequently are prejudicial to them, in relation to that Colouring; nay more, they are prejudicial as to the Maturity of thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> it being moſt certain for the generality, that a <hi>Fruit,</hi> much cover'd with Leaves, cannot Ripen altogether ſo ſoon as another, which is more expos'd, and moreover has not ſo much delicacy.</p>
                        <p>But a great deal of Prudence and Diſcretion muſt be us'd in this caſe; and care taken not to uncover <hi>Fruits</hi> until they have almoſt attain'd their proper ſize, and begin to loſe the great Greenneſs they had till then; <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to thicken from the moment they are Knit, until the beginning of <hi>June;</hi> and afterwards, as <hi>Gard'ners</hi> ſay, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for a conſiderable ſpace in a kind of Lethargy without thickening, at leaſt Viſibly; for I do not queſtion but they thicken a little, and that above all ſome Matter enters into the Inſide of the Body of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> ſince the <hi>Roots</hi> are continually preparing ſome, and ſending it immediately upwards; this matter indeed remains preſs'd under the Rind, which is the reaſon <hi>Fruit</hi> is ſo hard at that time; but finally the time which is regulated for their Maturity approaching, this very matter, tho' condens'd, begins to rarify, and to extend in few days, whereby the <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to ſoſten and thicken more, and conſequently to approach to Maturity.</p>
                        <p>This is the only proper time to uncover them, at two or three different times, and that during the ſpace of five or ſix days; for if they wereuncover'd ſooner, or all at once, the great heat of the Sun would certainly occaſion a great diſorder upon that tender

Rind, not yet accuſtom'd to the open Air; this truth is confirm'd by too many Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, when either through the Ignorance of an unskilful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or by ſome unlucky Froſts, the <hi>Fruits</hi> are uncover'd before that time; the ſame cauſe which ſplits the Rind of <hi>Fruits,</hi> likewiſe dries up the Stalks, and Conſequently the <hi>Fruit</hi> Withers and Rots, as it happens pretty often in <hi>Vinyards,</hi> which at the beginning of <hi>Autumn,</hi> are afflicted with ſome over haſtly Froſts.</p>
                        <p>Let us return to the Colour, which is deſirable for moſt <hi>Fruits,</hi> and ſay that it Imprints it ſelf in few days on thoſe that have been long cover'd, as it appears by <hi>Peaches, Apricocks,</hi> and eſpecially on the <hi>Quince Apples,</hi> &amp;c. and that therefore thoſe are much to blame, who neglect the procuring of ſo great an advantage to their <hi>Fruit,</hi> when it is ſo eaſily done. Moreover, in order to render that Colour more Bright and Lively, it is not improper, to uſe a kind of Seringe made on purpoſe, with ſeveral little holes at the end of the Spout, like thoſe of a Watering Pot, to water them twice or thrice a day, during the greateſt heat of the Sun: Such a watering ſoftens the Rind, and is of wonderful uſe to that end; eſpecially for <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> and it likewiſe ſucceeds well for <hi>Bon Chreten Pears,</hi> and <hi>Vergoules,</hi> &amp;c. Which remain ſomewhat Whitiſh, and which having a fine thin Rind, are Conſequently ſuſceptible to receive that fine Colour, which becomes them ſo well.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Maturity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the Order Nature obſerves in it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN fine <hi>Fruits,</hi> having attain'd their Size and Colour, and the time of their Maturity being arriv'd, it behoves us to improve thoſe rich Preſents which Nature treats us with; it is a Liberality, or rather a Profuſion it yearly beſtows upon us, as if it thereby delighted to recompence the Cares, and Induſtry of the skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> which Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it.</p>
                        <p>Two things are to be Conſider'd in every <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Pulp</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Pulp</hi> which is proper for the Nouriſhment of Man, and the <hi>Seed</hi> which lying in the heart of that <hi>Fruit</hi> as in a Sccabberd, receives its perfection by degrees, as the <hi>Pulp</hi> makes an end of Ripening; this perfection of <hi>Seed</hi> being apparently deſign'd for the Multiplication of the Specie of that <hi>Fruit;</hi> but this I only ſpeak by the by, yet it appears often that the <hi>Seed</hi> is of no uſe at all.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may be urg'd in relation to that <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Fruit,</hi> that Nature ſeems to perform in <hi>Trees,</hi> in reſpect to its <hi>Fruits,</hi> the ſame thing in part, which it performs in <hi>Animals,</hi> in relation to their Young ones; No body can be Ignorant of the extraordinary earneſtneſs of <hi>Animals</hi> to Nouriſh and Preſerve their Young, and that to a certain Point, that is until they attain that perfection of Size, and Strength, which every one ſtands in need of, either to Subſiſt of themſelves, or to labour afterwards to perpetuate their kind at the times which Nature preſcribes</p>
                        <p>Inſomuch, that till then thoſe <hi>Animals</hi> Fathers and Mothers, can hardly ſuffer, without reſiſtance, nay ſometimes without Fury and Cruelty, any Body to touch, much leſs to take away their Young ones; but when thoſe Young ones are grown big, Nature endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring on one ſide to Employ thoſe Fathers and Mothers with the Care of a new Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, and on the other hand to excite thoſe Young ones, as it were, to make a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in their kind, inclines thoſe Fathers and Mothers to abandon them, and to ceaſe Nouriſhing and Protecting of them; inſomuch that thoſe Young ones being grown big, ſhift for themſelves, no longer looking upon the Authors of their Being, or keeping them Company, otherwiſe than as indifferent Strangers.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Trees,</hi> which are really the Fathers of the <hi>Fruits,</hi> take care for a while to nouriſh thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> and to preſerve them, as if, if I may uſe the Expreſſion, they Suckled, or Hatch'd, or Heated them with their Leaves, and that to a certoin Point, that is, until they are come to the full Perfection of their Size, and Maturity: But then, Nature ſeeing them in a Condition not only of Subſiſting without the aſſiſtance of the Father that has produc'd them, but likewiſe of Perpetuating and Multiplying their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, ſeems to withdraw the affection of the <hi>Tree;</hi> Inſomuch, that before that time the <hi>Fruit</hi> ſeems to ſtick cloſer to the <hi>Tree</hi> than it does afterward: But when thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> ceaſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48210:177"/>
to receive the wonted help, they no longer ſtand in need of, and ſticking no longer to the <hi>Tree</hi> by the former Tye, they quit their Father and Mother, they drop, they keep aſunder, and laſtly are abandon'd to themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Pulp</hi> of thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> it is to be Noted, that the degree which approaches neareſt to what we call Rotteneſs, (which is their deſtruction,) is the perfection of their Maturity, inſomuch, that they are never perfectly good to Eat, until being abſolutely Ripe, they are near ſpoiling.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, unleſs the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> be careful to gather his <hi>Fruits,</hi> and make uſe of them, when they are entirely Ripe, he will be in danger of ſeeing them periſh, ſome through a Rotteneſs, which begins at firſt in ſome part of the Body, as it happens with moſt <hi>Apples,</hi> and others by growing Mealy, as <hi>Peaches,</hi> ſome by growing Soft firſt, as many <hi>Pears</hi> do, eſpecially ſuch as are Tender, as <hi>Butter-Pears,</hi> others by growing Dry and Shaggy, as moſt <hi>Muſc-Pears</hi> do; all which are different ways Conducing to Rotteneſs and Deſtruction. When this happens, Man is Subject to ſome inward checks of Nature, which ſeems to reproach him for his not having been Capable of Improving her Liberalities towards him.</p>
                        <p>It might be queſtion'd in this Place what Maturity is, and how it is perform'd, both which queſtions are pretty agreeable, but of no great uſe to a <hi>Gard'ner. Firſt,</hi> as to the Definition of Maturity, perhaps conſidering the great Proximity between it and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, we can hardly give a better, than to ſay, that it is a beginning of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The Truth is, that in ſpeaking of a thing which paſſes for a Perfection, it ſeems pretty odd to make uſe of a Term, which expreſſes defect, and is really diſguſting; but then to ſoften the ſignification of that Expreſſion, it will ſuffice to ſay, that there are ſeveral degrees of Corruption; many <hi>Fruits</hi> are Corrupted and Rotten, without ever having been Ripe, which Corruption is a real defect, without the leaſt Perfection. On the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there are other <hi>Fruits,</hi> which never begin to Corrupt unleſs they have attain'd the utmoſt degree of Perfect Maturity, which Corrupion is really a defect for the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but is at the ſame time a Perfection for the Eater: Thus we may ſay, that a Piece of <hi>Wood</hi> which becomes a Circle, receives a degree of Corruption in relation to it ſelf, ſince it ceaſes to have the Figure which Nature had given it, but it receives a Perfection in relation to the Workman, who forces it to take that bend, which it ſtands in need of for his uſe.</p>
                        <p>As to the manner, how Maturity is perform'd, the difficulty is much greater, and more puzling; for tho the Sun ſhining directly upon the <hi>Trees</hi> ſeems the only Author of the Maturity, of the <hi>Summer Fruits,</hi> by means of the <hi>Air,</hi> to which it has given a proper degree of Heat; yet we cannot ſay in general, that it is the only and laſt Author of the perfect Maturity of all manner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> ſince thoſe which are gather'd without being Ripe, Ripen of themſelves in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> where the Sun no longer ſhines directly upon them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it will be more proper and more likely to ſay, that the Sun indeed begins the Maturity of thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> which remain upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> to a certain degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, without which the <hi>Fruits</hi> ſhrink and ſpoil, without having enjoy'd the benefit of the real way of a good Maturity, and that after this the greateſt Crudity having been thus conſum'd by the Heat of the Sun, as all Natural Bodies are Subject to Corrupt, ſome ſooner, others later; one part of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> arrive at laſt to the Period of their Exiſtance, which often proves the Point of an agreeable Maturity; another part likewiſe meets its end in a precipitated Rottenneſs, which may proceed either from too much Cold, or too much Heat, or too much Moiſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We might likewiſe Pleaſe our ſelves with asking, whether thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are ſooneſt Ripe, are better for the Health of Man, than thoſe which are longer before they attain their Maturity. The like queſtion might be made, as to thoſe that are Perfum'd, and thoſe that are not; ſuch as have <hi>Kernels,</hi> and ſuch as have <hi>Stones, &amp;c.</hi> But whereas thoſe Gallantries are of no uſe to the matter in hand, I ſhall Wave them, and proceed to the Inſtructions that are neceſſary, in order to learn to gather <hi>Fruits</hi> Seaſonably, without loſing my Time in needleſs Philoſophy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, Care muſt be taken to underſtand that Maturity rightly, as alſo that not only every kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> has a time, or regulated Seaſon for its Maturity, but likewiſe that of every Particular <hi>Fruit</hi> in its Seaſon, ſome have as it were, about Week to be good in, and no more, as the <hi>Rouſſelets</hi> or <hi>Ruſſetins, Beurre</hi> or <hi>Butter-Pears, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamets, Verte-Longue</hi> or <hi>Long-Green,</hi> &amp;c. others not above a Day or two, and nothing beyond it, as <hi>Figs, Cherries,</hi> moſt <hi>Peaches, &amp;c.</hi> ſome have a great deal longer, as <hi>Grapes,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48210:178"/>
Apples,</hi> and moſt <hi>Winter Fruits,</hi> for Inſtance, an <hi>Apple</hi> or <hi>Bon Chreſtien Pear,</hi> will be good to Eat for a Month or ſix Weeks together.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it muſt be Noted, that every kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> has its peculiar marks of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, either ſuch as Ripen upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or ſuch as only Ripen ſome time after their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gather'd.</p>
                        <p>Altho Generally the Common time of Maturity of every kind, is within the Compaſs of the knowledg and underſtanding of Common <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who commonly are pretty able to diſtinguiſh which are <hi>Summer,</hi> which <hi>Autumn,</hi> and which <hi>Winter Fruits, &amp;c.</hi> Yet it is certain that the ſingular Marks of the Maturity of every <hi>Fruit</hi> in particular, to take them in the very nick of time, that is, the preciſe time of their Maturity, thoſe Marks, I ſay, are properly reſerv'd for the knowledg of a Gentleman who will uſe ſome Application a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, without which nothing is more Common than to ſee <hi>Fruits</hi> ſerv'd, either before their being Ripe, that is before they are good, or elſe paſs'd <hi>Fruits,</hi> that is, too Ripe, and Conſequently nought, and that at a time too, when without doubt, there are others, which having attain'd a juſt Maturity might ſupply the Room of thoſe, and which for want of being us'd at that time, have the misfortune to loſe their Delicacy, and the Value they deſerv'd.</p>
                        <p>One would think that there were but little to be ſaid upon the Subject of this Maturity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and yet the extream Application I have us'd about it for a long while, has cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd me of the Contrary. And whereas all the Expence, all the Care, and all the Pains People have been at, to get <hi>Fruit,</hi> would prove vain, if having Compaſs'd it, they were ſtill at a loſs, not knowing how to make the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe of it they propos'd, I think my ſelf Oblig'd not to Omit the leaſt Circumſtance of any thing that may ſeem Uſeful to that End.</p>
                        <p>I have already fully Explain'd in the Treatiſe of the Choice and Proportion of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are the <hi>Fruits</hi> not only of every Seaſon, but even thoſe which are of every Month, ſo that perhaps it would be tireſome and needleſs to Repeat it here; ſo that the only thing in Queſtion now is, to give a true Explication of what Relates to the Particulars of the Maturity of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> and if Poſſible to give the World a greater Inſight into that Knowledg, than it has had hitherto.</p>
                        <p>Above all things, I would have an Ingenious <hi>Gard'ner</hi> ſo well Skill'd in that Point, as never to Preſent any of his <hi>Fruits,</hi> Eſpecially of thoſe that are Tender and Mellow, as <hi>Peaches, Figs, Plums,</hi> or <hi>Pears,</hi> unleſs they were in a juſt degree of Maturity, in ſo much that thoſe they are preſented to, may take the very firſt, without the leaſt fear of being Diſappointed, or at leaſt may be able to chuſe with the Eye, without being reduc'd to Picking, and Squeezing, that is to ſpoil the <hi>Fruit,</hi> before they can meet with any to their liking.</p>
                        <p>My Intention is, that this Picking and Squeezing, which hitherto may have been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, or Tollerable, ſhall no longer be allowable, unleſs it be at the <hi>Tavern,</hi> or among ordinary People, and ſuch as have little or no nicety, or elſe ſuch as have no <hi>Fruit</hi> but what they Buy at the <hi>Market:</hi> And even there I would not have thoſe Squeezers, Squeeze any where but near the Stalk, and that gently too, Sticking to the firſt which yields to the Thumb, to the End that one Part only may be tainted by this Squeezing (which occaſions a beginning of Rottenneſs) beſides they may aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that whatever <hi>Fruit</hi> is Ripe near the Stalk, is ſufficiently ſo every where.</p>
                        <p>One of the moſt Conſiderable Defects I am to Combat here, is the Precipitation wherewith I obſerve moſt of the Curious are inclin'd, to begin betimes to Cauſe the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every Seaſon to be Eaten; nothing is more Common than to ſee that when People have begun ill, they continue during all the Seaſon to Eat their <hi>Fruit</hi> ill Condition'd, by reaſon that as Naturally the deſire of Eating <hi>Fruit</hi> continues from the Moment we have begun to do it, it commonly happens, that in gathering the Second or Third time we commit the ſame Fault we had been guilty of at the Firſt; whereas if we tarry to Eat thoſe that are in Seaſon until we have a ſufficient quantity Ripe to give, we have ever after the ſatisfaction of Eating none but ſuch as are incomparably good.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I adviſe all <hi>Gard'ners</hi> never to begin gathering until there be a viſible Appearance of a happy Continuance.</p>
                        <p>I am likewiſe to Combat another great Defect, of ſome of the Curious, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never to ſerve any <hi>Fruits</hi> until they be paſs'd, the Number of thoſe is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: Their fear of its not laſting long enough, or of not having enough for ſome occaſion or other, or rather their Ignorance in point of Maturity, occaſions all this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Therefore I will Endeavour to Remedy thoſe two Defects.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48210:178"/>
But firſt, I cannot forbear to admire, in this place, the Providence of Nature, not only in what relates to the ſucceſſion of that Maturity, which we ſee in relation to every kind of <hi>Fruit,</hi> commonly to make the one Ripen in one Seaſon, and the other in another; but alſo in what relates to the Order of the ſucceſſion of the Maturity of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> in particular, which it conducts to Maturity by degrees; as if it really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to allow Man, for the Nouriſhment of whom it ſeems to have produc'd them, time to conſume them all, without ſuffering any to periſh: And, indeed, it is obſervable, that Nature likewiſe obſerves the ſame Order for the forming, and the opening of the <hi>Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> which produce <hi>Fruit,</hi> as it does for <hi>Plants</hi> which only produce <hi>Flowers;</hi> for inſtance, <hi>Hiacints, Tuberoſes, Carnations,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Buds</hi> whereof only open by degrees, as if deſign'd thereby, the longer to delight the Senſes of Humane Creatures.</p>
                        <p>In effect, tho' every <hi>Bloſſom</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> does not commonly laſt above four or five days in its perfection, yet every <hi>Tree</hi> appears in <hi>Bloſſom</hi> for a Fortnight, or three Weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which certainly proceeds from that the <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> are Originally form'd, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards open one after another; thoſe that are form'd firſt, open firſt, as thoſe that <hi>Bloſſom</hi> firſt, have the advantage of producing thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> which ripen firſt; thus the ſecond and third <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> which are like ſo many younger Siſters, ſucceſſively form'd after the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeem to perfect themſelves, while thoſe delight our Eyes; thoſe ſecond, and third <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> I ſay, in imitation of a well-regulated Family, are not to open, and ſhew themſelves, until the Elders have had their Career; ſo that thoſe Elder fading, in order to produce the firſt <hi>Fruits</hi> of their Seaſon, the young ones appear, to form thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> which are to be the ſecond, and third, in Ripening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although we have obſerv'd in every <hi>Tree</hi> an order in the ſucceſſion of the Maturity of the <hi>Fruits,</hi> in relation to each other; we do not find this ſame Order of Succeſſion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity obſerv'd for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of another <hi>Tree,</hi> of a certain kind, in reſpect to the <hi>Fruits</hi> of another <hi>Tree,</hi> which is of another certain kind, whether both have <hi>Bloſſom'd</hi> at one and the ſame time, or whether the one have <hi>Bloſſom'd</hi> ſooner, the other later: For inſtance, all <hi>Peach-Trees Bloſſom</hi> at the ſame time, and yet ſome <hi>Peaches</hi> Ripen about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and others do not Ripen 'till towards the end of <hi>October;</hi> and likewiſe other <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> either <hi>Pear, Apple,</hi> or <hi>Plum-Trees Bloſſom</hi> almoſt all in one and the ſame Month, and yet that kind which <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> firſt, does not always Ripen firſt; Nature Orders it otherwiſe, which I can give no Reaſon for: The <hi>Pear</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> for Inſtance, is the firſt that <hi>Bloſſoms,</hi> and almoſt the laſt which comes to Maturity.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as it is moſt certain, that <hi>Fruits</hi> ripen one after another, ſo it is likewiſe true, that, as <hi>Aurora</hi> Uſhers in, or declares the coming of the Sun, ſo the Maturity of <hi>Fruits</hi> is declar'd, or preceeded by ſome particular marks, the knowledge of which, I have made it my buſineſs to ſtudy; and I am of Opinion, that I ſhall oblige the Curious, by acquainting them with my Obſervations.</p>
                        <p>'Tis certainly very difficult to be very exact as to the preciſe time of the juſt maturity of <hi>Fruits:</hi> Nothing is ſo common as to be deceiv'd therein, as we have already declar'd, either in gathering them too ſoon, or too late; beſides, there are ſome in which the Point of Maturity is ſo momentary, as the white <hi>Butter-Pear,</hi> the <hi>Maudlin-Pear,</hi> the <hi>Doyeinné,</hi> the <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Andilly, &amp;c.</hi> that whatever Care be taken, it is almoſt impoſſible to hit that Point of Maturity exactly, it paſſes ſo ſwiftly, when once 'tis come; neither am I fond of having many of thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As nothing is more delightful than to eat well-condition'd <hi>Fruits,</hi> nothing can be more diſagreeable than to eat them green, or over-ripe: Not but in my Opinion, this laſt defect is leſs tolerable than the firſt, by reaſon that all <hi>Fruit</hi> that is over-ripe, far from having any taſt, is commonly inſipid, and mealy; whereas <hi>Fruit</hi> that is not quite ripe enough, though on the one ſide it may ſet the Teeth on edge, yet on the other it diſcovers part of its Vertue, by the briskneſs of its taſt, and by its <hi>Pulp</hi> drawing near perfection; moſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this, will be of my Opinion.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, as in this particular Caſe of Maturity we have two ſorts of <hi>Fruit,</hi> of which, the one are good, from the moment they are gather'd; for inſtance, all Stone <hi>Fruits,</hi> ſome Summer-<hi>Pears,</hi> and all Red-<hi>Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. it follows, that none of thoſe ſhould be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd until they be ripe, by reaſon, that how little time ſoever their Maturity may laſt, they preſerve themſelves much better, and longer upon the <hi>Stock</hi> than they would do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gather'd: There are other <hi>Fruits</hi> which are only good ſometime after their being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd; for Example, moſt Kernel-<hi>Fruits</hi> that are Mellow, and conſtantly all Autumn, and Winter-<hi>Fruits.</hi> In Order to give true Rules to underſtand the Maturity of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I think it will not be improper to begin here with thoſe that are fit to be eaten as ſoon as gather'd; I ſhall not mention the others, until I come to the Treatiſe of the <hi>Store-Houſes,</hi> or <hi>Fruit-Rooms.</hi>

                        <p>Sometimes one Senſe alone is ſufficient, to Judge certainly of the appearances, and even of the reality; for inſtance, the <hi>Eye</hi> alone ſuffices for all Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> and for <hi>Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. it Judges with certainty of the Ripeneſs of a <hi>Cherry,</hi> a <hi>Strawberry,</hi> a <hi>Raſpberry,</hi> a Bunch of Red, or Black <hi>Grapes;</hi> when both the one and the other are all over Painted with that fine Colour, which is natural to them: And on the contrary, when any part does want it, the <hi>Eye</hi> thereby judges, that it is an infallible Mark, that all the reſt is not yet arriv'd to its juſt Maturity.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe, Feeling alone judges very well of the apparent and effective Maturity of Tender Mellow <hi>Pears,</hi> whatever they be; ſo that even the Blind are as able to judge of it by feeling, as the moſt clear Sighted, both by ſeeing, and touching.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it is neceſſary to imploy two of our Senſes, Seeing, and Feeling, barely to Judge of the appearance of Maturity; for Example, for <hi>Figs, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> and even <hi>Apricocks,</hi> it not being ſufficient for a <hi>Peach</hi> to appear ripe upon the <hi>Tree</hi> by its Beautiful Colour, red on the one ſide, and yellowiſh on the other, thereby to judge that it is fit for gathering; neither does it ſuffice after their being gather'd, for them to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Stalks, beſides this fine Colouring, though commonly it is a good Mark, the Stalk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſticking to thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits,</hi> until their being ripe, at which time the <hi>Fruit</hi> quits it with eaſe, and the Stalk remains fix'd to the <hi>Tree;</hi> but whereas this <hi>Stalk</hi> may have been ſever'd violently, their appearing without a <hi>Stalk,</hi> may chance to prove a falſe Mark of Maturity.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Signs alone, as to thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I ſay are not ſufficient, to Judge abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely by the <hi>Eye</hi> of their Maturity, the Hand muſt likewiſe act its part, and concur therein, tho' not to touch it roughly upon the <hi>Tree</hi> (nothing is more offenſive to me than thoſe Gropers, who, to gather one according to their Mind, will ſpoil a hundred by the violent impreſſion of their Unskillful Thumb) but I would have the Hand play its part in the manner I ſhall explain hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The Hand muſt likewiſe be us'd for a <hi>Peach</hi> that is ready gather'd, when we are not certain it was gather'd by a Skillful Hand, but then it muſt be perform'd very gently, and that, as I have already ſaid, near the <hi>Stalk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In caſe it be a <hi>Fig,</hi> whether gather'd, or not, it is allowable to touch it gently with the end of the Finger, almoſt in the ſame manner as a Chyrurgeon feels for the Vein in order to Bleed; for in caſe that <hi>Fig,</hi> after having appear'd to the Eye of a yellowiſh Colour, a ſhrivel'd <hi>Rind,</hi> with ſome Crannies, the Head hanging down, and the Body ſhrunk, likewiſe appears very Mellow under the Finger, and that being ſtill upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> may be looſen'd by the leaſt motion, it is very ſit for gathering, and without doubt ripe, and good: But if, notwithſtanding all thoſe fine appearances, and all this Myſtery, it does not eaſily quit the <hi>Tree,</hi> the gathering of it muſt be deferr'd for ſome days, it is never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, while it reſiſts in gathering.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Fig</hi> having all the good Marks of Maturity, has been gather'd by a Skillful <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and is afterwards preſented to any body, they may freely, and without any rough feeling, judge it to be fit to receive, and eat.</p>
                        <p>We may ſay the ſame thing of a <hi>Plum</hi> ready gather'd, that is, that if beſides the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Colour it ought to have, which ſatisfies the Eye, and the Mellowneſs which Skillful Fingers have diſcover'd, without offering it any violence, it proves without a Stalk, being a little ſhrivel'd, and wither'd on that ſide; it may be inferr'd from thence, that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ripe, and conſequently fit to take.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe if this <hi>Plum</hi> being ſtill upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> finely Colour'd for the Eye, and Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the Finger, comes off with eaſe, without a <hi>Stalk,</hi> it is without doubt fully ripe, but if not, like the <hi>Fig,</hi> itmuſt be left ſome days longer upon the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

Two things may be inferr'd from this remark about the <hi>Stalk,</hi> the firſt is, that it muſt not ſtick to ſome kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> when they are ripe; for inſtance, <hi>Peaches, Plums, Straw-berries, Raſpberries, &amp;c.</hi> inſomuch that none of thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> ſhould be eaten, while the <hi>Stalk</hi> ſticks cloſe to them; and the ſecond, that it may, and ought to ſtick to others, tho' never ſo ripe; for Example, to <hi>Figs, Cherries, Pears, Apples,</hi> &amp;c. to which, the <hi>Stalks</hi> ſerve as an agreeable Ornament, and their being without it, would be a kind of Defect.</p>
                        <p>After having demonſtrated, that in ſome <hi>Fruits,</hi> for Example, Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> the Eye alone is ſufficient to judge of their Maturity, and in others, as Tender Mellow <hi>Pears,</hi> the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only; as alſo that ſome others require both Seeing, and Feeling, <hi>Viz. Peaches, Plums, Figs, &amp;c.</hi> we may add, that there are ſtill ſome others in which Smelling may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with Sight, in order to Judge with more certainty, for inſtance, <hi>Melons,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving approv'd their Colour, Stalk, and Beautiful Figure, and examin'd their Ponderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is not improper to ſmell to them before we cut them, to be able, as 'tis thought, thereby to judge with more certainty of their Maturity, and Goodneſs, tho' at the ſame time I am convinc'd, that thoſe which have the beſt ſcent, or ſavour, are not commonly the beſt: This Maxim is ſufficiently well eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                        <p>But, in fine, generally ſpeaking, all the Marks above explain'd, to diſtinguiſh Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may chance not to be certain, and infallible; they are Exteriour Signs, which might be term'd Signs of Phiſiognomy, and Conſequently deceitful, ſomething more is neceſſary in this Caſe, it requires matter of Fact; and therefore, as we have already declar'd, Taſt only can decide in this Point; and, if I may uſe that Expreſſion, that only can affix the Seal, and the Character of an abſolute Decree, as a Judgment, which is to be Pronounc'd, particularly in the Caſe of Goodneſs; for let the Exteriour Marks be never ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, unleſs the <hi>Peach, Plum,</hi> and <hi>Melon</hi> pleaſe the Pallat, after having pleas'd the other Senſes, as it happens ſometimes, all the Preliminaries are uſeleſs; therefore we muſt ſubmit all to the Pallat, however with this ſcruple, which I cannot remove, for the eſtabliſhing of real goodneſs, which is, that Taſts are very different in themſelves, and that a thing which may pleaſe one Man's Pallat, may diſpleaſe another's: But this diſcuſſion is out of my Province; the Ancient Maxim <hi>(de Guſtibus)</hi> forbids my med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it, and thus I can only ſpeak of my own in particular, and at the ſame time applaud thoſe who have the good Fortune of liking that which does not ſeem good to me: It would be Ridiculous in me to endeavour diſabuſing of them, ſince probably I ſhou'd only loſe my labour.</p>

                           <hi>Fruits</hi> Ripen ſooner, or later, firſt, according as the Months of <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May</hi> are more or leſs warm, to cauſe the <hi>Trees</hi> to <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> or <hi>Knit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, according as thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> grow againſt a good Wall, or good Shelter, that is, expos'd to the <hi>South,</hi> or <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and, in fine, particularly according as they are in a hot Climate, and light Earth.</p>
                        <p>All which Conſiderations are very material for the forwardneſs of <hi>Fruits;</hi> for the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> proving hot, the <hi>Fruits</hi> knitting the ſooner, they will conſequently ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the ſooner; witneſs the maturity of <hi>Melons,</hi> which is an undeniable Truth; <hi>Fruits</hi> being, as it were, in reſpect to their Maturity, like Bread, in reſpect to its being Bak'd the ſooner, or later, according to the time of its being put into the Oven.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Fruits,</hi> tho' knit betimes, are in the open Air, or only againſt ſome Walls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or <hi>North, &amp;c.</hi> they will advance but little, for want of the aſſiſtance of the heats of the Spring, and likewiſe, if notwithſtanding the advantage of a pretty hot Seaſon, and happy expoſure, they are in a Cold Climate, nay, tho' in a moderate Clime, the Earth being Courſe, and conſequently Cold, they will not ripen ſo ſoon, as thoſe which have all things favourable.</p>
                        <p>For Example, all manner of <hi>Fruits</hi> ripen ſooner, in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> which are hot <hi>Soils,</hi> than in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris,</hi> and even in thoſe parts of <hi>Paris Fruits</hi> Ripen much ſooner within the City it ſelf, and in the Subburbs of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and St.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48210:180"/>
                           <hi>Germans,</hi> as well as at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> at <hi>Maiſons, Carriere, &amp;c.</hi> where the <hi>Earth</hi> is light, and hot, than they do at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> where the <hi>Ground</hi> is cold, and courſe.</p>
                        <p>All thoſe places are too near one another, to impute thoſe differences in point of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Sun; beſides, there is a difference between the immediate heat of the Sun in reſpect to the maturity of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the immediate heat of the Fire, in reſpect to the Meat it Roſts, or Boils, Fire firſt affecting the Exteriour parts of the Meat which are neareſt to it, before it performs its Function on the inſide, which is at more diſtance; whereas the Sun Ripens the inward parts, before the Exteriour; in effect, the inward part of <hi>Fruits</hi> always Ripens firſt, and ſoften firſt, and likewiſe commonly is the ſooneſt ſpoil'd.</p>
                        <p>If I may be allow'd to declare the Reaſon which to me ſeems moſt plauſible in this Point, I ſhall ſay, in the firſt place, that Maturity proceeds from two Cauſes, the one near and immediate, which is the heated Air, the other not indirect, and diſtant, and that is the Sun which heats that Air; ſo that the Function of the Sun is to heat the Air as much as the Winds will allow; and the Function of the Air ſo heated, is to impart its heat to the Earth, and ſo to all the <hi>Plants;</hi> this <hi>Earth</hi> thus heated, cauſes firſt the Principle of Life which lies near the <hi>Root</hi> to Act, and then the <hi>Root</hi> it ſelf, which conſequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <hi>Sap</hi> as ſoon as it is put in Action; and that <hi>Sap,</hi> at the ſame time, riſes to perform its Function into all the Superiour parts, where it can penetrate.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, I ſhall ſay, that the Air of every Climate is in probability compos'd, or at leaſt conſiderably mix'd with the Vapours, and Exhalations which riſe from the <hi>Earth</hi> of that Climate, which in my Opinion, is the Reaſon of Peoples ſaying, that the Air of ſuch a Country is good, and the Air of ſuch another is bad.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſay, that it follows from thence, that that Air is more or leſs eaſie to be heated, according as the <hi>Earth,</hi> from which thoſe Vapours riſe, is more or leſs cold, and material; for thoſe Vapours participate altogether to the Nature of that <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore that as in light <hi>Earths</hi> the Air ſooner receives the impreſſion of heat, by reaſon of its being form'd by more ſubtle Vapours, it conſequently the ſooner heats both that <hi>Earth,</hi> and the whole Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and the <hi>Plant</hi> it nouriſhes; which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it is the <hi>Roots</hi> being ſooner heated at ſuch times, and in ſuch <hi>Earth,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the <hi>Saps</hi> being ſooner prepar'd, which form inwardly in thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> the firſt degrees of Maturity.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is certain, that the Air, according to its being more or leſs thick, is alſo more or leſs apt to receive heat; and that according to its degrees of heat, it either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, or does not advance Maturity, as it has advanc'd, or not advanc'd the heat of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore the forwardneſs, or backwardneſs of Maturity, depends on the Conditions above explain'd, in ſo muuch, that they muſt all Combine; that is, that <hi>Fruit</hi> in order to Ripen betimes, muſt Knit betimes; and next, muſt meet with a favourable <hi>Expoſure,</hi> a hot Clime, and light <hi>Earth.</hi>

                        <p>ACcording to the Natural Order of the Maturity of <hi>Fruits</hi> of every Seaſon, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Elderſhip certainly belongs to early <hi>Cherries,</hi> and next to <hi>Strawberries, Raſpberries,</hi> and <hi>Goosberries, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt commonly begin to appear in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and that a little ſooner, or a little later, according as the Conditions we have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, are more or leſs favourable: <hi>Strawberries</hi> begin to <hi>Bloſſom</hi> about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> or a little before, in good Situations, and in cold places, not before the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> and happily, none of thoſe ſmall Froſts which are apt to blacken, and ſpoil thoſe firſt <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> intervening, Ripe <hi>Strawberries</hi> may be expected at a Months end: And as for early <hi>Cherries</hi> that have <hi>Bloſſom'd</hi> about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> we may expect to have them about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> not altogether Ripe, but half Red, with which Colour they may ſerve as well, as if they had attain'd a full Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, ſince they are only conſiderable, and valued for their Novelty, eſpecially by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48210:180"/>
for after all, at that time it is only a little colour'd Cloak, which only ſerves to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a little ſower <hi>Pulp,</hi> and a large Stone; and therefore they ſtand in need of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Confectioner, to require an Excellency, which the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or rather the Sun has not had time to afford them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Trees</hi> of a pretty Cold Climate <hi>Bloſſom</hi> almoſt as ſoon as thoſe of a Climate that is ſomewhat hotter, by Reaſon that the opening of thoſe <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> ſeems to be perform'd independantly from the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> witneſs the <hi>Branches</hi> that <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> being Cut, (the bare force of the Rarefaction caus'd in the <hi>Bud,</hi> by the preſence of the firſt Rays of the Sun, is capable of producing this Effect) but as for the maturity of every <hi>Fruit,</hi> it can only be perform'd, and perfected; Firſt, by a great Concurrency of the Operation of the <hi>Roots,</hi> and Secondly, by a certain degree of Heat in the Air, which is neceſſary for the Perfection of that Maſter-piece: Now this Heat, both in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and in the Air, can only proceed regularly from the Rays of the Sun; and yet I dare affirm, that I have been ſo happy as to imitate it in little for ſome ſmall <hi>Fruits;</hi> I have made ſome to Ripen five or ſix Weeks before their time; for inſtance, <hi>Strawberries</hi> at the end of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> in <hi>April, Figs</hi> in <hi>June, Aſparagus,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage-Lettuce</hi> in <hi>December, January,</hi> &amp;c. But we can find no <hi>facilitations</hi> to imitate this Heat in Great, to cauſe the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Large <hi>Trees</hi> to Ripen in an extraordinary manner; therefore it is apparent, that tho' Nature has abandon'd the <hi>Earth</hi> to us, leaving it in our Power to Heat ſome Portion thereof, to make it produce againſt its will, by means of a Foreign borrow'd Heat, what we have a mind to; has, notwithſtanding, reſerv'd to it ſelf in a particular manner, the Univerſal Faculty of the maturity of <hi>Fruits;</hi> this maturity in relation to us, is the Finiſher, and Perfection of the production of the <hi>Earth;</hi> in ſo much, that without it, all our Cares and Induſtry for the generality, only afford us ſome hopes, which often prove falſe, and deluding.</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid heretofore, that we may begin to have ſome early <hi>Cherries,</hi> in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> thoſe ſmall <hi>Fruits</hi> have an open Field at that Time, they are the only that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> and that grace our Tables; they are Rival'd by no others until the end of the Month, which is the time of the diſplaying or opening the Grand Magazine of the other Red <hi>Fruits;</hi> and theſe remain in poſſeſſion until the end of <hi>June,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of <hi>July;</hi> for the early <hi>Cherries</hi> which ſeldom appear but in <hi>China-Diſhes,</hi> and in ſmall quantity, are follow'd cloſe by <hi>Strawberries,</hi> with this difference; that theſe, to endear themſelves the more, above the <hi>Cherries</hi> that have preceeded them, appear with a Charming ſcent, and in prodigious quantity; that is, in full Baſons, and would think themſelves diſgrac'd to appear as poorly attended, as their Predeceſſors.</p>
                        <p>Among theſe <hi>Strawberries</hi> ſome are Red, and others White, the laſt are ſeldom Ripe until they are grown yellowiſh, and the others are never good, until they are perfectly and Univerſally Red; and neither of them are eatable, until they have attain'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſize.</p>
                        <p>I may ſay by the by, that thoſe <hi>Strawberries</hi> that are ſooneſt Ripe, are thoſe that have <hi>Bloſſom'd</hi> firſt, and that thoſe that are neareſt to the body of the <hi>Plant,</hi> are thoſe that <hi>Bloſſom'd</hi> firſt; I will draw ſome Inſtructions in the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> in order to our getting of them always Finer, Larger, and Better, from that part, than otherwiſe we ſhould do.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Strawberries</hi> that grow Naturally, and of themſelves, which moſt People are fond of, are accompany'd towards the middle of <hi>June</hi> with Red and White <hi>Raſpberries, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Hearts,</hi> and Plain <hi>Cherries,</hi> of which, ſome are ſomewhat earlier, and not ſo good; others later, which are larger, and ſweeter, and better, either Preſerv'd, or Raw: <hi>Bigar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaux</hi> alſo come in among them, and even <hi>Morrello</hi>'s, but commonly they both tarry until the hurry of Red <hi>Fruits</hi> is ſomewhat over; not but they might appear ſooner, for really thoſe <hi>Bigarreaux,</hi> and <hi>Morrello</hi>'s are admirable <hi>Fruits:</hi> The firſt are Ripe, as ſoon as they are half Red, but the others do not attain their perfection of maturity, until they are almoſt Black. The order of the maturity of all thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> is the ſame with what we declar'd for the <hi>Strawberries,</hi> that which has <hi>Bloſſom'd</hi> firſt in every <hi>Tree,</hi> likewiſe Ripens ſooneſt.</p>
                        <p>Here's the Month of <hi>June</hi> provided for, it is call'd the Month of Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> and with Reaſon: For thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> are met with wherever one goes; we have ſaid that the marks of their maturity is that Red Colour which ſurrounds them; it commonly begins at that part which is moſt immediately expos'd to the Sun, and is ſooneſt Ripe; In fine, by degrees that Colour ſpreads all over, and when the livelineſs of that Red begins to turn to an obſcure Red, excepting only the <hi>Morello</hi>'s, they draw towards Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

Among Red <hi>Fruits,</hi> thoſe that have Stones, tho' never ſo ripe, do not eaſily looſen from the <hi>Branch,</hi> as other <hi>Fruits</hi> do, they wither upon it, inſtead of falling, they muſt be pluck'd off, and that with ſome Violence.</p>
                        <p>All thoſe kind of Red <hi>Fruits</hi> ſhould be the only ones during the whole Month of <hi>June</hi> to fill up the Stage of the maturity of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of that Seaſon, but that ſome <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> expos'd to the <hi>South,</hi> in Dry Sandy Grounds, begin to produce towards the end of <hi>June</hi> ſome little <hi>Muſcat-Pears,</hi> and ſome early <hi>Muſck-Peaches.</hi>

                        <p>Thoſe ſmall <hi>Pears</hi> are Extraordinary good, if they be allow'd the time of Ripening; the firſt marks of their maturity appear in them as in all other <hi>Pears</hi> of every Seaſon, that is near the <hi>Stalk,</hi> which part muſt appear a little yellowiſh, and ſomewhat Tranſparent; and afterwards, for a greater mark of full maturity, that yellowneſs muſt appear a little through a certain Tan'd Colour, and a certain Red, which covers the remainder of the <hi>Rind;</hi> and Laſtly, they muſt begin to drop of themſelves, without any exterior violence; at which time it will be proper to gather, and eat them.

                        <p>When People do not allow themſelves the time of examining about the Stalk of the <hi>Pears,</hi> to judge of their maturity; they muſt, as I have ſaid, judge by the natural drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of thoſe kind of <hi>Pears,</hi> but then the Worms muſt have no ſhare in it, and they muſt neither be grown upon a ſick <hi>Tree,</hi> nor upon a ſick <hi>Branch; Pears</hi> that are infected with Worms drop ſooneſt, and ſooneſt ſeem Ripe, without really being ſo, their defect is not much conceal'd, it appears generally in the middle of the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Pear,</hi> and when it does, there's no depending upon it for good <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All manner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> borh Stone, and Kernel, Ripen ſooner upon ſickly <hi>Trees,</hi> than upon ſound ones; but we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be deceiv'd by the ſize, for it often happens, eſpecially in relation to <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> that the <hi>Fruits</hi> of thoſe languiſhing <hi>Trees</hi> are larger than thoſe which grow upon Vigorous <hi>Trees;</hi> but then that Largeneſs, as I may ſay, is only a ſwelling, or a kind of Dropſie, which is the Reaſon that the <hi>Pulp</hi> of thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> that are larger than they ſhould be, is generally inſipid, or bitter, and diſguſting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peaches</hi> that drop of themſelves, are contrary to what we have been ſaying of <hi>Pears;</hi> by reaſon that <hi>Peaches</hi> which drop thus of themſelves, or looſen, are commonly paſs'd, and conſequently naught, in ſo much, that they ſhould not be preſented as good to any body, tho' not bruis'd by the fall, as it happens commonly.</p>
                        <p>But that Rule does not commonly extend to ſmall <hi>Peaches</hi> in their kind, nor eſpecially to early or late Purple <hi>Peaches,</hi> nor to <hi>Pavies;</hi> thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> which can hardly ever be too ripe, are commonly very good when they drop, inſomuch, that when they drop without being ſhook, it is a good mark of their Maturity, as well as Goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid of <hi>Plums,</hi> ſince we always ſhake <hi>Plum-Trees</hi> in order to get good <hi>Plums;</hi> tho' indeed this Method is more particularly for common <hi>Plums,</hi> than for <hi>Perdrigons, Rochecourbons,</hi> and other Principal <hi>Plums,</hi> by reaſon that one of their Chief Excellencies conſiſting in the Flowry Beauty of their Complexion, the which excites the Appetite of the moſt moderate: A fall, or their being finger'd too much, ſpoils that Flower which ſhould be preſerv'd carefully; therefore thoſe that are really Curious, never touch them otherwiſe than with the extremity of two Fingers.</p>
                        <p>Let us now return to our early <hi>Peaches,</hi> and ſay, that the Part which ripens firſt in them, as well as in all other <hi>Fruits, Pears, Peaches, Plums, Apricooks, Melons,</hi> &amp;c. is commonly the inward part, I mean, that which is neareſt to the Stone, and moreover, that which in relation to them appears firſt ripe to the eye, is directly contrary to what we have ſaid of <hi>Pears;</hi> for whereas in <hi>Pears</hi> that part which is neareſt to the <hi>Stalk</hi> ripens firſt, in theſe it is commonly the Extremity which is oppoſite to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> by reaſon that that part enjoys the benefit of the Sun ſooner, and longer than any other; but when the Beams of the Sun lay upon no part of theſe early <hi>Peaches,</hi> it ſeems that the heat which Reigns in the Air, ripens them all over equally.</p>
                        <p>We begin to Judge of their approaching Maturity, when we perceive that they begin to thicken extreamly (which we call taking <hi>Pulp)</hi> and when at the ſame time, their green whitens conſiderably, and their down begins to fall; but unfortunately for thoſe poor <hi>Fruits,</hi> or rather for Nice Pallats, and ſuch as have Skill; thoſe firſt appearances of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity are commonly miſtaken for perfect maturity, and ſo they are gather'd, while they are ſtill as hard as Stones, inſtead of ſtaying until they are grown Mellow, as they ſhould be; and therefore, excepting a few of the firſt, which are ſerv'd pretty unſeaſonably, moſt of them paſs through the fire, before they appear at Table.</p>
                        <p>I muſt not omit ſaying in this place, that the <hi>Peaches</hi> which do not attain the ſize their kind requires, commonly drop before their being ripe, and when they ſeem to ripen,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48210:181"/>
their <hi>Rind</hi> remains downy, their <hi>Pulp</hi> green, their Water bitter, and the Stone Larger than thoſe which have taken more <hi>Pulp.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither muſt I forget to ſay, that as a little after the knitting of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> generally a conſiderable part of it drops, ſo it often happens that at the time the maturity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, a great number of the <hi>Fruits</hi> fall, and that about a Fortnight, or Three Weeks before that maturity, as if the <hi>Tree</hi> was ſenſible of its being over-burthen'd, and would thereby give us notice that the good time is approaching; and indeed it is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd at that time, that a good number of Large <hi>Fruits</hi> drop, whereby thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, grow the finer, and the better; and as we have already ſaid, it had been much the better for them, had the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> taken Care to perform what time has now done.</p>
                        <p>People are overjoy'd to ſee thoſe early <hi>Peaches</hi> ripe at the end of <hi>June,</hi> and to enjoy them long, which is not difficult, provided we have ſeveral <hi>Trees</hi> of them in different <hi>Expoſures;</hi> they are incomparable, when they are well-Condition'd, both as to ſize, and maturity; but then we are commonly expos'd to the vexation of tarrying until towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> for the <hi>Peaches</hi> that ſucceed theſe firſt, and thoſe we call <hi>Troy-Peaches;</hi> which <hi>Peaches,</hi> provided they be throughly ripe, charm every body by the fineneſs of their <hi>Pulp,</hi> the perfume of their Water, and the deliciouſneſs of their Taſt; their maturity is known as in other <hi>Fruits,</hi> Firſt by the ſize, Secondly by a fine red Colour on that ſide which is expos'd to the Sun, and a light Tranſparent Yellow in the other parts: Thirdly, by a thin, ſoft, mellow <hi>Rind,</hi> ſomewhat like Satin; any of theſe marks being wanting, the <hi>Fruit</hi> cannot be ripe, and therefore ſhould not be gather'd.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe <hi>Troy-Peaches</hi> are often abus'd as well as the early <hi>Peaches,</hi> and all other <hi>Peaches</hi> at the entrance of their maturity; that is, they are gather'd upon the leaſt Symptoms, without ſtaying until they have attain'd that degree of goodneſs, they never obtain 'till they are throughly ripe; and this defect proceeds, either from the ignorance, or liquoriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Perſon, who gathers them out of deſire to eat, or elſe out of a ſilly avidity of gain, which reigns in the Heart, and Eyes of thoſe who are uneaſie until they expoſe them to ſale in the Market.</p>
                        <p>The Month of <hi>July</hi> affords us many other <hi>Fruits</hi> beſides <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> but the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſurpaſſes it in point of abundance, for it affords us not only an infinity of <hi>Plums,</hi> but alſo a vaſt quantity of Kernel-<hi>Fruits;</hi> among which, are the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madame,</hi> or <hi>Lady-Thigh,</hi> the <hi>Gros-Blanquet,</hi> the <hi>Sans-Peau,</hi> or <hi>without Rind,</hi> The <hi>Eſpargne,</hi> or <hi>Sparing,</hi> the <hi>Orange-Pears,</hi> the <hi>Summer-Bon-Chreitien,</hi> the <hi>Caſſolets,</hi> the <hi>Robins,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſettings,</hi> &amp;c. the maturity of which is known, either by their dropping, or not reſiſting when they are gather'd, or elſe by a certain yellow colour, which appears in the <hi>Rind,</hi> eſpecially near the <hi>Stalk.</hi> Among <hi>Plums</hi> we reckon the <hi>Perdrigons,</hi> the <hi>Mirabelles, Imperials,</hi> St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine, Roche-Courbon, Queen Claude, Apricock-Plums, &amp;c.</hi> To thoſe <hi>Plums</hi> are joyn'd about the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſome fine <hi>Peaches, Viz.</hi> Firſt, the two <hi>Magdalens,</hi> the white and red, the <hi>Mignonne,</hi> the <hi>Bourdin,</hi> the <hi>Roſſane,</hi> &amp;c. all which are large: In the ſecond place, the <hi>Alberges,</hi> both red, and yellow, the <hi>Cherry-Peach,</hi> the one with white <hi>Pulp,</hi> the other with yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoſe <hi>Peaches,</hi> as well as thoſe that are to ſucceed them, have no other particular marks to diſcover their maturity, than thoſe I have already mention'd for early, and <hi>Troy-Peaches,</hi> which are a reaſonable ſize, a red and yellowiſh colour without any mixture of Green, and eſpecially their coming off with eaſe at the leaſt pull or motion of a Skilful hand; all theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> are fit to eat as ſoon as gather'd, and require no <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> at leaſt to ripen, <hi>Peaches</hi> never ripening off the <hi>Tree,</hi> ſo that it is in vain to gather them before they are perfectly ripe; but as I have ſaid elſewhere, a day or two's repoſe in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> far from injuring of them, affords them a certain coolneſs which is very proper for them, and which they cannot acquire, while they remain upon the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Month of <hi>September</hi> is famous for a world of the Principal <hi>Peaches,</hi> the <hi>Chevreuſe, Haſty Violet, Perſique, Admirable, Pourpree,</hi> or <hi>Purple-Peach, Bellegarde, White d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilly,</hi> beſides <hi>Brugnons,</hi> and white <hi>Pavies, &amp;c.</hi> There are alſo ſome Summer <hi>Calville Apples,</hi> and ſome good <hi>Pears,</hi> which keep theſe <hi>Peaches</hi> Company, and may be eaten off the <hi>Tree, Viz.</hi> The <hi>Melting-Pear</hi> of <hi>Breſt,</hi> brown <hi>Orange-Pears,</hi> &amp;c. At leaſt they will not keep long, the <hi>Pears</hi> grow too mellow, and the <hi>Apples</hi> grow downy; but yet at this time Kernel-<hi>Fruit</hi> will begin to require a little reſt in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> and the beſt way to judge of their maturity, is to ſqueeze them gently with the Thumb about the <hi>Stalk,</hi> to try whether they yield, or no.</p>
                        <p>The Month of <hi>October</hi> is likewiſe to be valued for the laſt Admirable <hi>Peaches</hi> it produces in the open Air, or in the <hi>Weſt, Viz.</hi> The <hi>Nivet,</hi> and latter <hi>Violets,</hi> beſides the Large Red, as well as Yellow <hi>Pavies,</hi> without omitting the fine latter yellow <hi>Peaches,</hi> all growing in good Expoſitions.

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the Situation that is proper for the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are gather'd, in order to Preſerve them ſome time.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN Order to end what I have begun, I am now only to ſpeak of the means of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as much as can be, good <hi>Fruits</hi> after their being gather'd, and of the means of tranſporting them when it is neceſſary: As to the preſervation, I mean ſuch in particular, as are not gather'd until they have attain'd a full maturity, and ſuch as being extream tender and puny, make an end of acquiring it after their being taken out of the <hi>Garden,</hi> both the one and the other loſing their Luſtre and Beauty to a high degree, by being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bruis'd, rub'd, ſcratch'd, or ſpotted with little black Spots; ſuch are your <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Peaches</hi> with their fine Colour, and delicate <hi>Pulp;</hi> ſuch are <hi>Plums</hi> with the fine flower that covers them, and <hi>Butter-Pears</hi> that are perfectly ripe; This has no relation to other <hi>Fruits</hi> that are neither ſo choice, as <hi>Cherries, Morello's, Bigarreaux,</hi> &amp;c. Nor ſo eaſily ſpoil'd, as <hi>Melons, Pavies,</hi> hard <hi>Pears,</hi> baking <hi>Pears,</hi> all <hi>Apples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe that every <hi>Fig,</hi> every <hi>Peach,</hi> and every <hi>Plum</hi> has been gather'd with all the Caution I have heretofore explain'd, inſomuch, that in the taking them off the <hi>Tree,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to their perfection; I alſo ſuppoſe, that in the gathering of them, care has been taken to lay them in <hi>Sives,</hi> with tender ſoft <hi>Leaves,</hi> as <hi>Vine-Leaves,</hi> &amp;c. And to place them all aſunder, that they may be no wiſe ſqueez'd, nor any laid a top of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon that the weight of the upermoſt would be capable of bruſing the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and that particularly for <hi>Peaches,</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> for <hi>Plums</hi> are not ſo heavy as to hurt one another.</p>
                        <p>Now, in order to preſerve thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> ſome days, that is, two or three days, eſpecially the <hi>Peaches;</hi> they muſt be laid either in <hi>Cloſets,</hi> or <hi>Store-Houſes,</hi> which muſt be very dry, and clean, and full of Shelves, the Windows being always open, unleſs it be in very Cold weather: Hereafter I will explain the Conditions of a good <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Conſervatory;</hi> you muſt lay a finger thick of Moſs upon thoſe Shelves, which may ſerve, as it were for a kind of Quilt, taking care that the Moſs be very dry, and has no ill ſcent; the Reaſon of which is, that every <hi>Peach</hi> ſo plac'd, ſinks of it ſelf into the Moſs, and lies ſoftly, without being ſqueez'd by any of the others. I dare affirm that it is with <hi>Peaches,</hi> as with <hi>Melons,</hi> which are better to eat a day after their being gather'd, and left at a diſtance from the Sun, than Juſt after their being gather'd, at which time they are lukewarm: Altho' it is not good to touch <hi>Fruit</hi> much, either upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> or in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> yet, provided it be perform'd by a Skilful hand, it will not prejudice it; therefore, while thoſe <hi>Peaches</hi> lay in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> they muſt be carefully viſited once a day, to ſee whether there appears no marks of rottenneſs, at the ſame time removing all ſuch that are in the leaſt tainted, otherwiſe they would ſpoil others.</p>
                        <p>It is neceſſary to place <hi>Fruits</hi> well in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> thoſe that have not thoſe regards, loſe abundance of them by their own fault: the beſt ſituation for <hi>Peaches,</hi> is, to be plac'd, not only upon Moſs, but upon the part which Joyn'd to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> otherwiſe they are apt to bruiſe; <hi>Figs</hi> muſt be laid ſidewiſe, by reaſon that if they were laid upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> they would loſe their beſt juice; as for <hi>Plums,</hi> whereas they have no great weight they may be laid any how, as well as <hi>Cherries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The beſt ſituation for <hi>Pears,</hi> their Figure being Pyramidal, is to be plac'd upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> with the <hi>Stalk</hi> upwards; it is indifferent whether <hi>Apples,</hi> the Figure of which forms a perfect Cube, lay upon the <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Stalk,</hi> which is always very ſhort, both theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> will preſerve themſelves well enough upon the bare boards, beſides, for a while they may lie upon one another, when firſt brought out of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> until they approach to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity; but above all, I would not allow them any Bed or Covering of Straw, or Hay, by reaſon, that commonly it gives them an ill ſcent.</p>
                        <p>The beſt way for <hi>Grapes</hi> is to hang them up in the Air faſten'd to a packthread, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Hoop, or ſix'd to ſome Beam; beſides, they may be laid ſafe enough upon Straw,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48210:182"/>
and when any body deſires to preſerve them until <hi>February, March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> they muſt be gather'd before they are perfectly ripe, otherwiſe they are apt to rot too ſoon; beſides, Care muſt be taken once in two or three days to pick all the rotten ones carefully.</p>
                        <p>All manner of <hi>Apples</hi> will laſt until <hi>March,</hi> and ſome until <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the <hi>Reynettes,</hi> or French <hi>Peppins, Apis, Roſe-Apples, Francatie, &amp;c.</hi> Care being taken that the greateſt Mark of their maturity commonly conſiſts in being ſomewhat wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, excepting the <hi>Apples</hi> of <hi>Api,</hi> and the <hi>Roſe-Apples,</hi> which never wrinkle; they are known to be ripe when all the green which appear'd in the <hi>Rind</hi> is turn'd yellow.</p>
                        <p>The deſtiny of <hi>Pears,</hi> as to their laſting, is very different, thoſe that laſt longeſt, are the <hi>Bon-Chreſtiens, St. Lezin, Dry-Martins, Martin-Sires, Baking-Pears, Double-Bloſſoms,</hi> and ſome <hi>Franc-reals, &amp;c.</hi> I will ſpeak more at large of them in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Store-Houſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have ſet down elſewhere which are commonly the <hi>Pears</hi> of every Month, and therefore it would be uſeleſs to repeat it here: Red <hi>Fruits</hi> laſt but little after their being gather'd, <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Raſpberries</hi> are ſeldom good after a day, <hi>Cherries, Morello's, Bigarreaux,</hi> and <hi>Currans</hi> may perhaps laſt a day longer; good <hi>Fruits</hi> ſhould be ſerv'd upon the Table in the ſame ſituation they are plac'd in the <hi>Store-Houſes,</hi> in order to make a pretty ſhow, excepting only <hi>Pears,</hi> which in that Caſe require ſome agreeable Cimetry for the Conſtruction of the Pyramids.</p>
                        <p>With all theſe Precautions, <hi>Fruits</hi> may be eaſily preſerv'd as long as they can laſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can prejudice them, but great Winter Froſts, which are very dangerous, by reaſon that they may penetrate into the <hi>Store-Houſes,</hi> and ſo reach the <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> that has once been Frozen, preſerves no manner of goodneſs, and immediately decays; thoſe that have no <hi>Store-Houſes</hi> made on purpoſe, with all the neceſſary regards, I ſhall explain in the ſequel, and who have only a Cloſet, or ſome ordinary room, are in danger of loſing all their <hi>Fruit</hi> in bad Weather, unleſs they take a great deal of care to cover them well with good Blankets, or place them between two Quilts, or elſe carry them into ſome Cellar, until the danger be paſt, at which time thoſe poor Priſoners are taken out of their Dungeons, to be put at Liberty again in their former Places.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Difficulty in queſtion has no relation to any <hi>Pears,</hi> being newly gather'd, nor to any hard Baking <hi>Pears,</hi> tho' ripe, provided, in caſe they be Winter <hi>Bon-Chretien Pears,</hi> every <hi>Pear</hi> be wrapt up in a piece of Paper; neither has this difficulty any relation to any <hi>Apples</hi> whatever; thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits</hi> tho' laid pell mell in Baskets, or Panniers, will indure the being carry'd, either upon a Horſe, or in a Cart; but we cannot do ſo with tender mellow <hi>Pears</hi> when they are ripe; in that caſe they are like the <hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Peaches, &amp;c.</hi> their delicacy and tenderneſs requires a gentle uſage, like Beautiful young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, otherwiſe the agitation of the Carriage would bruiſe and blacken them, and conſequently would deprive them of their greateſt Ornaments, and even of their chief goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>This Prelude conducts us inſenſibly to eſtabliſh, that <hi>Peaches, Figs, Strawberries, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rello's, &amp;c.</hi> in order to their being tranſported from one place to another, require Water-Carriage, or the Back or Arms of a Porter without any jogging, and above all, if they be <hi>Peaches,</hi> they muſt be laid upon that part which is fix'd to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> without touching one another, and be laid firſt upon a Bed of <hi>Moſs,</hi> or tender <hi>Leaves</hi> laid pretty thick; and in the ſecond place, wrapt up in <hi>Vine-Leaves,</hi> and ſo well order'd, that they may not move out of their places; and finally, in caſe ſeveral Beds be laid over one another, a good ſeparation muſt be made between them of <hi>Moſs,</hi> or of a reaſonable quantity of <hi>Leaves,</hi> the laſt Couch muſt likewiſe be pretty well cover'd with <hi>Leaves,</hi> and the whole wrapt up with a Cloth, well faſten'd, in order to keep all that is contain'd in the Basket cloſe, and in good order: The ſafeſt way would be to do with <hi>Peaches,</hi> what I am going to preſcribe for <hi>Figs,</hi> but then the inconvenience is, that it would be impoſſible to carry any conſiderable quantity at a time. For <hi>Figs</hi> you muſt have Sives not above two inches deep, and lay a bed of <hi>Vine-Leaves</hi> at the bottom of them, and place the <hi>Figs</hi> ſidewiſe, wraping them up firſt, aſunder, each in one of the ſaid <hi>Leaves,</hi> taking care to order them ſo well, and ſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48210:183"/>
neatly cloſe to one another, that the motion of the tranſportation may not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, and never lay two a top of one another: This firſt and only Bed being made, it muſt be cover'd with Leaves, and next with a Sheet of Paper, neatly fix'd round about the Sive, and moreover ſtay'd with ſome ſmall Packthread, in order to keep the <hi>Fruit</hi> cloſe into the ſaid Sive.</p>
                        <p>Good <hi>Plums</hi> being laid up, without any Ceremony, in any Basket, or Sive, with a good Bed of <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>Nettles</hi> at the bottom of it; the top muſt alſo be cover'd with <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> after having firſt taken off the thickeſt down, which being done, the whole muſt be Cover'd with a Linen Cloth, or ſome Sheets of Paper, faſten'd with ſome Pack-thread:</p>

                           <hi>Apricock-Plums</hi> are ſent from <hi>Tours</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> upon Meſſengers Horſes, with a great deal more precaution apart, for they are put in Boxes ſtuff'd with Houads, every one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover ſeparately wrapt up in Houads; but that Expedient is Chargeable, beſides it is impoſſible to carry many at a time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Strawberries</hi> being likewiſe order'd in double ridges, in Baskets made on purpoſe, ſtuff'd with leaves at the bottom, and round about; it will ſuffice to cover them with a fine Wet Piece of Linnen, abundance of them are carryd thus, according to the bigneſs of thoſe Baskets.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Grapes,</hi> either <hi>Muſcat</hi> or <hi>Chaſſelas,</hi> are partly carry'd in the ſame manner I have noted for <hi>Peaches;</hi> nay with leſs Ceremony, ſince it is not very material to ſeparate every Bed with Leaves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Muſcat Grapes,</hi> are ſometimes ſent into diſtant Countrys, and they are put in Caſes fill'd with Bran, and carry'd upon Horſes or Mules, care being taken that the <hi>Bunches</hi> may not touch one another; But that is an Expence only proper for Kings, or very great Lords.</p>
                        <p>For the Tranſportation of our Principal <hi>Fruits,</hi> when they are only to be ſent a Days Journey at moſt, I commonly uſe certain ſquare Baskets, divided in the Inſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Stories, which are at a convenient diſtance from one another, to place our Sives full of <hi>Fruit;</hi> thoſe are either made of very Cloſe Ozier, and then they need no other covering to ſecure them from Duſt, or elſe of looſe <hi>Ozier,</hi> and then they muſt be cover'd with Sere-Cloath; moreover, thoſe Baskets open ſidewiſe like a kind of Preſs, or elſe at the top, and then the loweſt Story muſt be fill'd firſt, and a little covering laid over it which ſerves to cloſe this firſt, and to bear the Second, and thus to the uppermoſt; a ſmall Pad-lock may be fixed to it, at pleaſure, to which two Keys may be made, the one for thoſe to whom the <hi>Fruit</hi> is ſent, and the other remaining with the Perſon who ſends it, by which means the <hi>Fruit</hi> is convey'd ſafely.</p>

                           <p>Of Store-Houſes, or Conſervatories for Fruits.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IF in that very ſeaſon, when <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> Charm moſt by their <hi>Greenneſs,</hi> and neatneſs, <hi>Fruits</hi> are notwithſtanding their chief Ornament, what advantages, or rather what Conſolations are not thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> capable of affording us, when in the middle of a diſmal, Melancholy Winter, we are provided with a Conſiderable ſtore of them, and even ſome of them Infinitely better than any the Summer had ſupplied us with. There is no denying that we are all naturally inclined to have a Violent Paſſion for <hi>Fruits,</hi> and by that very reaſon, as they are delicious to the Palate, we eaſily perſwade our ſelves that they are of uſe for our Health; Phyſitians who are to give no Rules againſt Infirmities, are ſo far from oppoſing this Opinion, that they Eſtabliſh it as Infallible, and often preſcribe the uſe of <hi>Fruits</hi> as Soveraign Remedies; for which reaſon moſt People are at preſent Curious of <hi>Fruits,</hi> and many Gentlemen are proud of expreſſing their Earneſtneſs in Rearing them: Nature ſeems to delight in favouring that Curioſity, it yearly produces abundance of <hi>Fruits;</hi> the Summer produces but too many, and Autumn yields a ſufficient quantity; but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is to have ſome in the Winter, which is a Dead, Infertile Seaſon; therefore we ſhould make it our ſtudy to preſerve ſuch, as are only good a conſiderable while after their being gather'd; they are Expos'd to a long Journey, in which they are to run many hazards: It does not only require a careful man, but alſo a Place that may be altogether proper to preſerve

them; we muſt on one ſide Combat Cold which deſtroys all thoſe it reaches, on the other hand we muſt prevent all ill ſcents, which would ſpoil what the Weather had ſpar'd: This Place is commonly call'd a <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> or <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> which without doubt muſt have its Rules, and particular properties, ſince it is ſo uſeful, and is to produce ſuch good Effects. It is to be ſuppos'd that I muſt needs be skill'd in that Point, conſidering the Great and Ancient uſe I have made of it in <hi>Gardens;</hi> and Conſequently I ſhould certainly be blam'd, unleſs I declar'd what my Experience has taught me in relation to <hi>Store-Houſes,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avoid the defects that are to be fear'd in it, or to attain the ſucceſs that is to be hop'd for.</p>
                        <p>Let other Curioſo's, which are in ſo great a Number, cry up their Cloſets as much as they pleaſe, let them Invite every body to come and ſee them, let them be careful in making rich Deſcriptions of them, I am ſo far from finding fault at it, that I am one of the firſt to Commend them, I Viſit them with a ſingular ſatisfaction, and take great delight in looking upon ſuch things as are moſt Extraordinary, not only for the matter, but likewiſe for the Workmanſhip; I ſay, let People cry up thoſe Collections of Miracles of Art, but at leaſt let them allow thoſe that are Curious in <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> the liberty of boaſting of their <hi>Store-Houſes</hi> of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which are their Cloſets; not that they contain any Originals, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, far from it, their greateſt Value conſiſts altogether in Novelty, but then they are excellent Novelties; that is, they are productions of Nature, which renew, and take new Vigour Yearly: Productions which indeed are only, if I may uſe the Expreſſion, ſo many Copies of its firſt Productions at the Birth of Time, which at the ſame time ſurpaſſes the Merit of thoſe Originals: By reaſon that this Nature having been Charm'd at firſt, with the Beauty of its firſt Eſſays, has taken delight in repeating them as often as it could, as if it really Study'd more and more to improve, even to that degree, that it ſuffers it ſelf to be Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little by <hi>Culture,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Culture</hi> really contributes to the Perfectioning of its new Productions.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, I am of Opinion, that no Body will deny that this Cloſet deſerves to be ſeen, and in truth nothing can be more agreeable to ſight than this <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> where at the firſt Entrance you diſcover a kind of well contriv'd Room, of which the ſize is proportion'd to the Occaſion for which it was Built, where you diſcover in the next Place, a fine Edg d-Table, which takes up the middle of the Place, and is convenient and neceſſary to order the Baskets, or <hi>China-</hi>Baſons that are to be ſerv'd, where finally you diſcover the four Walls Garniſh'd, and ſee all the Shelves well Order'd, and fill'd both in Autumn and Winter with fine <hi>Fruits;</hi> thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> differently plac'd with flying Labels, to expreſs their kinds, and Maturity in relation to the Sequel of Months; thus <hi>Burgamots</hi> are order'd in one Place, <hi>Virgoules</hi> in another, <hi>Ambrets</hi> here, <hi>Thorn-Pears</hi> there, <hi>Leſchaſſerirs</hi> here, the St. <hi>Germans</hi> there, <hi>Bonchretien</hi> here, <hi>Bugy</hi> there, Baking <hi>Pears</hi> here, there the <hi>Apples,</hi> with the ſame Diſtinctions obſerv'd for the <hi>Pears;</hi> here <hi>Fruits</hi> that drop of themſelves, there ſuch as have been gather'd in Seaſon, here thoſe of the <hi>North,</hi> there thoſe of good <hi>Eſpalies;</hi> here thoſe of <hi>High-Standards,</hi> there thoſe of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> there the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are Ripe in ſuch a Month, there thoſe that do not Ripen ſo ſoon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with this Conſtant order, that thoſe that are Ripe are always moſt within reach, both for the Hand and Eye, and thoſe that are not Ripe yet, according to their Degree, plac'd upon higher Shelves, where they expect the Seaſon that is to ripen them, and Conſequently to be remov'd in the Room of thoſe that are Paſs'd; thoſe firſt Diſappear after having perform'd their Part, and finiſh'd their Career; and others are ready to Succeed them, and as it were, to come each to their turn to ſerve the quarter which is deſſign'd for them.</p>
                        <p>Finally, do's not the Liberality of our Curioſo towards his Friends (for he loves to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part what he has) deſerve ſome privilegde to raiſe the Merit of his Cloſet above others, out of which we only bring bare Ideas, and were far from receiving any Liberaliteis, on the contrary the Curioſo makes profeſſion of being cloſe Fiſted; he never makes a ſhow of his Treaſure unleſs it be againſt his Will; there conſtantly appears a great deal of diſguſt in him, which ſometimes proceeds from the fear of being Robb'd, but more commonly out of fear of not being thought as Rich, as he pretends to be.</p>
                        <p>Let us now Proceed to Eſtabliſh the principal Conditions of a good <hi>Store-Houſe;</hi> In my Opinion the Firſt conſiſts in its being inpenetrable to Froſts; great Cold as we have already often declar'd being a mortal Enemy to <hi>Fruits,</hi> thoſe that are once Frozen, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after good for any thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="96" facs="tcp:48210:184"/>
It follows from thence, for the Second Condition, that this <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> muſt he expos'd to the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or at leaſt to the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the <hi>Northern</hi> Expoſition would be very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to it.</p>
                        <p>It alſo follows for the Third Condition, that the Wall of the ſaid <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> muſt be at leaſt Twenty Four Inches thick, or elſe the Froſt could not be kept out.</p>
                        <p>It likewiſe follows for the Fourth Condition, that the Windows beſides the Common Quarrels, ſhould have good double Paper Saches, Very cloſe, and very well ſtopt, together with a Double Door, inſomuch that the Cold Air from abroad, may not be able to enter in, for it would certainly deſtroy the Temperate Air which has been preſerv'd of Old in the Inſide, it is impoſſible to be too exact in this care, ſince the leaſt or any, might occaſion a great deal of diſorder in one Froſty Night; I do not in the leaſt approve the making of Fire in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, I have ſufficiently Eſtabliſh'd in the Treatiſe of <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Conditions, which perhaps have not been exactly Obſerv'd the thing being pritty difficult, it is abſolutely neceſſary to have ſome ſmall Veſſel full of Water in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> to be certain, It is a faithful Incorruptible Centry, which is to give us notice of all that may Prejudice us; when that Water does not Freeze there is nothing to be done; but when it Freezes in the leaſt, a remedy muſt Immeadiately be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd: The Colds of the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1670, 1675, 1676, 1678, that of <hi>January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> 1679. and eſpecially that of <hi>December</hi> 1683, and of <hi>January</hi> 1684, which laſted a whole Month, without diſcontinuation the laſt time, muſt needs ſerve for a great Inſtruction in this Matter; it required a great deal of Care, and forecaſt, not to be caught by it. A good Weather-Glaſs plac'd on the out-ſide at the <hi>Northern-Expoſure</hi> is of great uſe; we have reaſon to Judge the Peril great, when this Weather-Glaſs continues for two Nights together to be, at the fifth and ſixth Degrees, and even the ſeventh and eighth; the firſt Night may have done no harm, the ſecond is much to be fear'd, and therefore it is very neceſſary the very next Day after ſuch a Night to uſe good Quilts, or good Blankets, or elſe a great deal of dry Moſs to ſecure our <hi>Fruits</hi> from Froſt; nay more, having a good Cellar, it will be very proper to remove our <hi>Fruits</hi> into it, and leave them there until the great Cold be paſs'd, and in all theſe Caſes care muſt be taken to replace all thoſe <hi>Fruits</hi> as they were before in the <hi>Store-Houſe;</hi> as ſoon as the Weather grows better, and to remove ſuch as are Ripe, and ſuch as are tainted, Rotenneſs is one of the worſt accidents to be fear'd, while <hi>Fruits</hi> are not in a Condition to be Viſited often one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>After having made Proviſion againſt Cold, we muſt Study to preſerve our <hi>Fruits</hi> from ill Taſte; the Neighbourhood of Hay, Straw, Dung, Cheeſe, a great deal of Foul Linnen, eſpecially ſuch as has been imploy'd in the Kitchen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all very dangerous, and muſt not in the leaſt be ſuffer'd near our <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> or <hi>Conſervatory;</hi> a certain Muſty Taſte, together with the ſmell of many <hi>Fruits</hi> laid up together is likewiſe very diſagreeable, and therefore the <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> muſt not only have good Overtures, and a high Ceiling, the juſt meaſure of which, is to be from Ten to Twelve Foot high, but the Windows muſt often be kept open, that is, as often as there is no fear of great Cold either in the Night, or in the Day, freſh Air from without, when it is Temperate, is Incomparable to purify, and reeſtabliſh, that which has been long inclos'd.</p>
                        <p>For the Sixth Condition, I think I may ſay, that neither a Cellar nor a Garret are ſit to make this <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> the Cellar by reaſon of a muſtineſs, and moiſt heat that are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from it, which inclines the <hi>Fruit</hi> to Rottenneſs; the Garret becauſe of the Cold, which eaſily Penetrates the Roof; and therefore a ground Room is the beſt for our Uſe, or at leaſt a firſt Story, accompany'd with other Lodging-Rooms Inhabited over and under it, as well as on the ſides.</p>
                        <p>I add to this Sixth Condition, that the <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> muſt be often viſited by him that has it in Charge, which is neglected when he is not at Hand, that is, conveniently plac'd, by reaſon of the trouble of going too much up, or down.</p>
                        <p>The ſeventh Condition requires, many ſhelves fram'd together in order to Lodge the <hi>Fruits</hi> ſeparately the one from the other, the fineſt on the beſt ſide, and Baking-<hi>Pears</hi> on the worſt; <hi>Apples</hi> muſt lye by themſelves. The reaſonable diſtance of theſe Shelves is to be about Nine or Ten Inches; and I would have them about Seventeen or Eighteen Inches broad, that they may hold the more, and pleaſe the ſight the better.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48210:184"/>
For the Eighth Condition, I would have thoſe ſhelves a little ſloaping outwardly, that is, about an Inch in the Breadth, with an Edge about Two Fingers high, to hinder the <hi>Fruit</hi> from Falling: The <hi>Fruits</hi> are not ſo much in ſight when the Shelves are level, as when they are as I deſire them, and thus when any of them are Rotten it is not ſo eaſily perceived, and that Rottenneſs Communicates it ſelf to thoſe that are about it, unleſs remedy'd at firſt.</p>
                        <p>The fear of that Rottenneſs requires for a Ninth Condition, that every Shelf ſhould be viſited at leaſt every other day, without fail, to remove what ever may be tainted.</p>
                        <p>And for the Tenth Condition, it requires that the Shelves ſhould be cover'd with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for Inſtance dry Moſs, or about an Inch thick of fine Sand, in order to keep every <hi>Fruit</hi> ſteady, after its being plac'd upon its Baſis, as it ſhould be, and to keep it aſunder, for the <hi>Fruits</hi> muſt no wiſe be allow'd to touch each other: It is much pleaſanter to ſee them all in a row upon their Baſis, that is, upon the Eye which is oppoſite to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> than to ſee them Lye pell mell any how.</p>
                        <p>I require for the Laſt Condition, that Care be taken to Sweep our <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> or <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> often, to ſuffer no Cobwebs in it, and to keep Traps for Rats and Mice, and moreover it will not be amiſs to allow it ſome ſecret Entrance for Cats, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Fruit</hi> will be in danger of being gnaw'd by thoſe Curs'd little Domeſtick Animals.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> which is particularly deſign'd for <hi>Winter-Fruits,</hi> is likewiſe very uſeful for thoſe of <hi>Autumn,</hi> either <hi>Pears</hi> or <hi>Grapes,</hi> and for <hi>Summer Fruits,</hi> either <hi>Peaches, Pavies, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe being in my opinion, as I have already ſaid, much better a day after their being gather'd, than the very day; they acquire a certain coolneſs in the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> which is a great Improvement which they can never have, while they are upon the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now whereas generally ſpeaking, the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are moſt Conſiderable, are only brought into the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> after their having acquir'd one of the two Maturities, which is proper for them, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>Summer Fruits</hi> an approaching Maturity, which Expediates them in few days, and for <hi>Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Winter-Fruits,</hi> a diſtant Maturity, which makes them keep long, ſome leſs, ſome more; and beſides, whereas it is the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maturity, which is of moſt Conſequence, as well for thoſe good <hi>Fruits,</hi> which would periſh miſerably, unleſs taken in the nick, as for the Maſter whoſe pains, cares, and hopes would be loſt, unleſs he were capable, as the ſaying is, to nick the Critical Minute; it follows from thence, that it is neceſſary to make an end of giving, in this place, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible marks by which this Maturity is to be known: I have already explain'd thoſe: marks for moſt <hi>Fruits</hi> which do not exceed <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October, viz.</hi> for the remainder of <hi>Summer Pears,</hi> the remainder of <hi>Plums,</hi> the beſt latter <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Pavies, &amp;c.</hi> There now remains to ſpeak of <hi>October Pears,</hi> and others, which keep from <hi>All-Saints,</hi> till <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and longer.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Vertelongue</hi> or <hi>Long-Green, Butter-Pears, Vine-Pears, Meſſire-John, Green-Sugar-Pears,</hi> &amp;c. after theſe, the <hi>Petit-oins, Lanſaes, Marchioneſſes, Burgamots, Amadottes,</hi> and even the <hi>Beſideri,</hi> and <hi>Thick-Stalks,</hi> &amp;c. are the firſt, that are to paſs during the Month of <hi>November;</hi> the <hi>Thumb</hi> (as we have obſerv'd already, for the <hi>Butter-Pears, Long-Greens, Green-Sugar-Peart,</hi> and others, which have began to ripen in <hi>October)</hi> daly turns what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ripens out of the <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Petit-oins, Marchioneſſes, Ruſſettines, Lanſaes</hi> &amp;c. by reaſon that theſe are ſtill tender <hi>Pears;</hi> a Whitiſh Colour which forms it ſelf in the Rind of the <hi>Meſſire-John,</hi> a Yellow caſt in the <hi>Amadottes, Thick-Stalks, Beſideri,</hi> &amp;c. and a moiſture upon the Rind of the <hi>Burgamots,</hi> together with a little Yellowneſs which diſcovers it ſelf upon them, all thoſe are certain ſigns which inform us without the help of the <hi>Thumb,</hi> of what we have a mind to know of thoſe loſt kinds of <hi>Fruits,</hi> 'tis but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of them Conſtantly, or at leaſt every other day, and that Rule of review for the Maturity is to be continu'd the following Months for all other <hi>Fruits,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, in order not to loſe the leaſt ſign which diſcovers their approaching Maturity; moreover this review is neceſſary, to remove ſuch as begin to Rot.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Louiſe-bonne, Winter-Thornes, Ambrets, Leſchaſeries,</hi> St. <hi>Germains, Vergoules,</hi> even the <hi>Dry-Martins, Spaniſh Bon-Chretiens,</hi> with the <hi>Apples</hi> of all kinds, of <hi>Capendu,</hi> either Grey, or Red, or White, the <hi>Apples</hi> of <hi>Fenouillet, Autumn Calvils,</hi> ſome <hi>Apis,</hi> and ſome <hi>Reynettes,</hi> &amp;c. all theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> begin to ripen at the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> and a little Yellowneſs, together with ſome Wrinkles diſcovers it ſelf upon the Six firſt, by which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48210:185"/>
we may judge, in caſe that they do not reſiſt the <hi>Thumb,</hi> that they are fit to Eat, but until then, we muſt not venture to meddle with them; in cutting of them, the Knife would ſoon diſcover their want of Ripeneſs; thoſe kind of <hi>Pears</hi> are very Subject to ſoften, and thereby are certainly apt to deceive thoſe who do not ſtrictly Examine them every day.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Dry-Martins,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Bon-Chretiens,</hi> it is with them in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> juſt as what I am going to ſay in <hi>January</hi> for the <hi>Portail-Pears,</hi> as ſoon as ever there appears the leaſt Spot of Rotteneſs upon any of them, you may boldly attack them all, their time is come, and they are ſoon threaten'd with Rottenneſs; but yet with this advantage, that they remain a pretty while in the State of perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Capendu, Fenouillet,</hi> and <hi>Reinettes,</hi> declare their Maturity as ſoon as they become extreamly wrinkled, the <hi>Apis</hi> declare theirs when their Green Colour turns to Yellow.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Calvils</hi> ſeem to become lighter, and their kernel looſſens, and rattles in ſhaking, when they ripen, they remain good a long while, as well as the <hi>Reinettes,</hi> which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Yellow, without wrinkling, and, thoſe are admirable qualifications in thoſe kind of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>People muſt not grow weary of often feeling the tender melting <hi>Pears</hi> of that Seaſon, the lazy and negligent thereby fall into great Inconveniences.</p>
                        <p>Such <hi>Fruits</hi> as have reſiſted the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> will final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield to it in their turns in the Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> but when the <hi>Winter-Thorns,</hi> are not able to change their Colour a little in theſe Months, they become Mealy and Inſipid, and in a Word, periſh without attaining a perfect Maturity, which is a cruel loſs to the Curious, ſince it is really one of our beſt <hi>Pears.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have made very conſiderable Obſervations in relation to it, and of ſome others, in the Treatiſe of the Choice and Proportion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Louiſe-bonnes,</hi> and the <hi>Long-Greens,</hi> of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> ſeldom grow Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but they wrinkle, and become ſoft, mellow, and agreeable to feel.</p>
                        <p>Many <hi>Ambrets</hi> ſoften, before they grow Yellow, particularly ſuch as grow <hi>North-ward,</hi> or upon <hi>Dwarf-ſtandards,</hi> and eſpecially upon <hi>Trees Graffed</hi> upon free <hi>Stocks,</hi> that are too full, therefore theſe, as well as all other <hi>Pears</hi> which grow upon <hi>Northern Eſpaliers,</hi> require Sugar above all others, to correct their Taſte, which is not ſo good as it ſhould be, tho they are ſo very full of Water.</p>
                        <p>The large <hi>Winter-Musky,</hi> and the <hi>Portail-Pears</hi> have ſome Friends, neither of them Value the skill of the <hi>Thumb,</hi> but the Yellowneſs of the firſt, and a few wrinkles, or ſome Rotteneſs in the ſecond, to Invite their Votaries do make uſe of their merit, what ever it be.</p>
                        <p>One of the chief things I mind in ordering my <hi>Fruits</hi> in the <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory,</hi> is not only to place every kind upon different Shelves, or when I do put ſeveral upon one, they are diſtinguiſh'd by diviſions of Edges, but I likewiſe make the ſame diſtinction among <hi>Fruits</hi> of the ſame kind; firſt I place thoſe that are fallen before their time (for I do not fling them away) by themſelves, out of ſight, they ſeldom look well, by reaſon of their growing very much wrinkled, indeed ſome more, and others leſs, and that according to their dropping, ſooner, or later; but yet they ripen at laſt, tho pretty long after the others of their kind; and I cannot forbear doing of them the Juſtice to ſay, that they are pretty often incomparably good under a wither'd, ugly, wrinkled <hi>Rind,</hi> eſpecially when their fall does not exceed a Month before the time of the common gathering.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, Pears</hi> growing upon <hi>Dwarf-Standards</hi> are apart, as well as thoſe of good <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> or <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I follow the ſame Method for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>High-Standards,</hi> and the ſame for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Northern Eſpaliers,</hi> by reaſon that regularly the <hi>Fruits</hi> of good <hi>Eſpaliers</hi> ripen firſt; thoſe of Vigorous <hi>Dwarfs</hi> follow them in this order, thoſe of <hi>Dwarfs Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince-Stocks</hi> preceed thoſe that are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Free-Stocks,</hi> and thoſe of Infirm <hi>Trees</hi> preceed both the one and the other.</p>

                           <p>Of the Diſeaſes of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is apparent, that by a Law Univerſally Eſtabliſh'd, all Living Animated Beings are ſubject to ſome Accidents, which hinder them from enjoying a perpetual, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways equally Vigorous health; this is the reaſon that it is not only among Men, and other Animals, we find different Diſtempers: <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and more particularly <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> are likewiſe ſubject to certain Infirmities that deſtroy them, which we may very well term Diſtempers; yellow <hi>Leaves</hi> out of Seaſon, new <hi>Shoots</hi> growing black, and dying on their Extremities in the Months of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September, Fruits</hi> remaining ſmall, or dropping of themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are, as the Phyſicians term it, ſo many ſpeaking Symptoms, informing us of the indiſpoſition of the <hi>Foot.</hi> Among thoſe Infirmities, there are ſome that may be Cur'd with the aſſiſtance of ſome Remedies, and others which hitherto appear Incurable; ſince whatever can be done to them, has ſtill prov'd Ineffectual, perhaps time may produce ſome Skilful Perſon, whoſe Knowledge and Experience may give us ſome light, in a Caſe which expoſes us to ſcorn, or at leaſt to pity. In the mean time, ſince it is but too true that our <hi>Trees</hi> are liable to different Diſtempers, <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> would certainly be blame-worthy, if they did not make it their Study to find out effectual Remedies for ſome, and to ſatisfie themſelves as to the others; and if knowing thoſe Remedies, they were not careful to apply them upon occaſion: For it were vain for them to breed <hi>Trees</hi> in their <hi>Gardens,</hi> to be liable to ſee them periſh in their prime, for want of knowing how to Cure them, and reſtore them to their priſtine Vigour.</p>
                        <p>In Order not to omit any thing relating to thoſe Accidents which our <hi>Trees</hi> are liable to, without including ſuch as proceed from too long wounds, of great Heat, of great Cold, of Storms, of Whirlwinds, Hails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think my ſelf oblig'd to ſay, in the firſt place, that there are Diſtempers common to all <hi>Trees</hi> in general; Secondly, that there are ſome that are peculiar to every particular kind: The common Diſtempers conſiſt either in a defect of Vigour, which makes the <hi>Trees</hi> appear in a languiſhing Condition, or elſe in a ſtorm of large white Worms, which are ſometimes form'd in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and there gnaw the <hi>Roots,</hi> or the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Neighbouring <hi>Stem;</hi> thoſe miſchievous little Inſects which we call <hi>Tons,</hi> by degrees cauſe ſo great a diſorder, that the <hi>Tree</hi> which is attack'd by them, and had always appear'd Vigorous before, all on a ſuddain dies without any Remedy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48210:186"/>
The Peculiar Diſtempers are, for Example, in <hi>Pear-Treees</hi> againſt a Wall, when their <hi>Leaves</hi> are attack'd with what we call <hi>Tigers:</hi> Cankers, and Scabs in other <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> Viz. <hi>Robins,</hi> ſmall <hi>Muſcadins, &amp;c.</hi> Gum on Stone-<hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> which commonly deſtroys that part on which it fixes, either <hi>Branch,</hi> or <hi>Stem;</hi> and when, unfortunately it attacks the part where the <hi>Tree</hi> is graffed, which is often hid under ground, it inſenſibly ſpreads round about that <hi>Graff,</hi> without any bodies obſerving of it, for the <hi>Tree</hi> ſtill continues in a good Condition, while there remains any paſſage for the <hi>Sap;</hi> but, finally, this Gum hindering this <hi>Sap</hi> from riſing to the upper parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> makes that <hi>Tree</hi> die ſuddenly, as if it had been ſuffocated by a kind of Apoplectick Fit.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, ſome <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> are alſo attack'd with Aemets, and a ſmall kind of green Fleas, which ſometimes faſten on the young <hi>Shoots,</hi> and hinder them from thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; ſometimes on the new <hi>Leaves,</hi> and cauſe them firſt to ſhrink, next to dry, and fall: We have likewiſe <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> Winds which blaſt, in ſome Springs wither, and as it were burn all the new <hi>Shoots;</hi> inſomuch, that the <hi>Trees</hi> on which this unlucky In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence lights, appears dead, while others about them are green, full of fine <hi>Leaves,</hi> and continue to produce fine <hi>Shoots:</hi> Beſides this, are not the moſt Vigorous <hi>Trees</hi> ſubject to have the end of their new <hi>Shoots</hi> intirely cut off by a little black round Inſect, call'd <hi>Bud-Cutter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fig-<hi>Trees</hi> dread the great Colds of the Winter, which are capable of Freezing their whole head, unleſs they be extreamly well Cover'd, but it is not ſufficient to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them againſt Froſt.</p>
                        <p>They are likewiſe ſubject in that Winter Seaſon, to have the lower part of their <hi>Stems</hi> gnaw'd by <hi>Rats,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Liſete.</note> 
                           <hi>Mulots</hi> which makes them pine, and die.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe very Animals, together with <note n="*" place="margin">Garden-Mice.</note> 
                           <hi>Laires,</hi> Ear-wigs, and Snails, likewiſe ſpoil the very <hi>Fruit</hi> on the <hi>Trees</hi> when they approach to maturity, eſpecially <hi>Peaches,</hi> and <hi>Plums;</hi> have not <hi>Gooſberry-ſhrubs</hi> their peculiar Enemies alſo, which are a kind of ſmall green Caterpillars, which form themſelves towards the Months of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> on the back part of their <hi>Leaves,</hi> and eat them to that degree, that thoſe little <hi>Shrubs</hi> remain altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bare; and their <hi>Fruit</hi> no longer having any thing to cover and defend them from the great heats of the Sun, is deſtroy'd, without being able to Ripen.</p>
                        <p>I might run over all the Accidents which all the reſt of <hi>Gard'ning</hi> is liable to, and cauſe abundance of Diſorders in it: For Example, <hi>Strawberry-Plants</hi> in the prime of their Youth and Vigour, are as it were treacherouſly attack'd in their very <hi>Roots</hi> by thoſe wicked <note n="*" place="margin">Weeſels.</note> 
                           <hi>Tons</hi> which deſtroy them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and <hi>Succory, &amp;c.</hi> conſtantly have ſome of thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">Thoſe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by the Name of Cock-Chafers.</note> 
                           <hi>Tons,</hi> or other little reddiſh Worms which gnaw them about the neck, and kill them juſt as they come to perfection.</p>
                        <p>How much do <hi>Artichokes</hi> ſuffer by little black Flies which infeſt them towards the end of Summer, and <hi>Mulots,</hi> or <hi>Garden-Mice,</hi> which gnaw their <hi>Roots</hi> in the Winter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and <hi>Succory</hi> are abſolutely devour'd by Snails, ſome of which are long, and yellow, ſome blackiſh, and gray, and others little and white, eſpecially in Rainy Weather.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sorell</hi> is tormented in very hot weather with little Black Fleas, which gnaw all the <hi>Leaves,</hi> inſomuch that it becomes of no uſe.</p>
                        <p>Even <hi>Cabbages</hi> are ſpoil'd by green Snails, which gnaw and ſpoil all their <hi>Leaves;</hi> but I am only to ſpeak in this place, of thoſe Diſtempers that may be Cur'd in <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and not of ſuch as are Incurable, nor of thoſe that are incident to <hi>Kitchen-Plants;</hi> thoſe commonly proceed, either from the defect of the Ground, which does not furniſh nouriſhment enough, or from an ill <hi>Culture,</hi> or a defect in <hi>Pruning,</hi> or finally, from a defect in the <hi>Tree,</hi> which was not well-condition'd, either before it was Planted, or in Planting of it.</p>
                        <p>It therefore follows, in the firſt place, that the <hi>Soil</hi> may contribute to Diſtemper our <hi>Trees,</hi> which commonly happens when the <hi>Earth</hi> is not Fruitful in it ſelf, or is perhaps become ſo by being exhauſted, or when it is too dry, or too moiſt; or elſe when, tho' never ſo good, there is not a ſufficient quantity of it.</p>
                        <p>In order to remedy all thoſe kind of Inconvenients, I ſay, that when the <hi>Soil</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertile, as it happens in many places, where there is nothing but clear Sand, the Maſter is to blame to have Planted any thing in it, the defect of it can never be Corrected, whatever quantity of Dung he puts into it; the only Expedient is to remove that <hi>Earth,</hi> and put better <hi>Mould</hi> in the room of it: Happy are thoſe who can meet with it in their Neighbourhood, and thereby avoid the Trouble and Charge of fetching it at a diſtance. As to that which is worn out, it is likely that there may be ſome better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48210:186"/>
it which may be us'd, unleſs People would allow it two or three years time to lie <hi>Fallow,</hi> in order to amend it by reſt, but there is no pleaſure in loſing ſo much time: When we reſolve to make this Exchange of <hi>Mould,</hi> and yet are unwilling to remove the <hi>Tree</hi> which is not Old, one half of the <hi>Roots</hi> muſt be <hi>Prun'd</hi> short again, which will ſuffice for the firſt Year, doing the ſame again at the end of two years, to the other half of the <hi>Tree:</hi> Nothing Exhauſts the Ground more than the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> lying long in the ſame place, eſpecially the <hi>Roots</hi> of Neighbouring <hi>Trees,</hi> particularly Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado's of <hi>Elms; Fruit-Trees</hi> muſt of neceſſity Pine, or Periſh, if that Neighbourhood ſubſiſts.</p>
                        <p>When the Ground is too dry, and light, the beſt Remedy is to ſoak it often with frequent Waterings, or by Artificial falls of Water, or elſe by ordering Spouts, or, Dreins in ſuch a manner, that they may Conduct the Water of Rains into the Squares and Bordures, as I have explain'd it in the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> about Soils.</p>
                        <p>When the Ground is too moiſt, that part muſt be rais'd where the <hi>Trees</hi> ſtand, making lower Ridges to receive the Waters, and Conduct them out of the <hi>Gardens</hi> by <hi>Gutters,</hi> or <hi>Aqueducts,</hi> as I have done in the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> of <hi>Verſailles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When there is not <hi>Mold</hi> enough, it muſt be augmented, either about the <hi>Roots,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all the ill <hi>Mould,</hi> to put better in the room of it; or elſe laying new <hi>Mould</hi> over the Surface of it; the <hi>Mould</hi> being thus amended, without doubt the <hi>Trees</hi> will thrive better in it, and grow more Vigorous.</p>
                        <p>When the diſtemper is only viſible by a certain yellowneſs, as for Example; <hi>Pear-Trees Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Quince-</hi>Stocks, in certain Grounds, always grow yellow, tho' the Ground ſeems to be pretty good; it is a good and certain Advertiſement to remove them, and to place others in their room upon <hi>Free-Stocks,</hi> which are much more Vigorous, and agree better in an indifferent <hi>Soil,</hi> than others.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Peaches Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Almond-</hi>Stocks, caſt too much Gum in moiſt Grounds, others muſt be Planted upon <hi>Plum-</hi>Stocks, and when they do not thrive upon <hi>Plum-</hi>Stocks in Sandy Grounds, only ſuch muſt be Planted there, as are <hi>Graffed</hi> upon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If, on the other hand, the <hi>Tree</hi> appears over-burthen'd with <hi>Branches,</hi> ſo as only to ſhoot very ſmall ones, it muſt be eas'd, until it begins again to produce fine <hi>Shoots,</hi> always performing that <hi>Pruning,</hi> by lowering the uppermoſt <hi>Branches,</hi> or by removing part of thoſe that cauſe a Confuſion in the middle, obſerving the Maxims I have eſtabliſh'd for good <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Diſtemper proceeds from the <hi>Trees</hi> being ill-Condition'd before its being <hi>Planted;</hi> as for inſtance, from its having a Scabby poor <hi>Foot,</hi> half dead for want, or from its being too weak, the beſt way is to pull it out, and place a better in the room of it.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Tree,</hi> being good in it ſelf, has been Planted too deep, or too ſhallow, or with too many <hi>Roots,</hi> the beſt expedient is to take it up again, <hi>Prune</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> a-new, and Re-plant it according to the Rules of Art.</p>
                        <p>And to all theſe Ends, it is very neceſſary to keep always ſome Dozens of good <hi>Trees</hi> in Baskets, to place new ones ready grown in the room of ſuch as muſt be remov'd.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Trees</hi> are attack'd with ſome Cankers, you muſt with the point of a Knife remove the part ſo tainted to the quick, and then apply a little Cow-Dung to it, covering it with a piece of Linen, a kind of <hi>Rind</hi> will grow over it, which will cover the Wound, and ſo that Accident will be Cur'd.</p>
                        <p>When Catterpillars annoy a <hi>Tree,</hi> Care muſt be taken to remove them.</p>
                        <p>When Rats gnaw the Barks, Snares and Traps muſt be laid for them.</p>
                        <p>When the Diſtemper is ſuppos'd to proceed from <hi>Tons,</hi> the Foot of the <hi>Tree</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to Extirpate them abſolutely, putting new <hi>Mould</hi> in the room of the old, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhortned the <hi>Roots</hi> that are gnaw'd.</p>
                        <p>Among the Incurable Diſtempers of our <hi>Trees,</hi> I reckon firſt Old Age; when for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> or <hi>Plum-Tree</hi> has ſerv'd for Thirty, Forty, or Fifty years, we may conclude that it has attain'd a decrepit Age, and conſequently, that it has perform'd its part, and is out of date, there is no hopes of a return, it muſt be taken out, not leaving any of its <hi>Roots</hi> into the Ground, putting new <hi>Mould</hi> into the room of it, in order to Plant new <hi>Trees</hi> there, when People are deſirous of ſeeing <hi>Trees</hi> in the ſame Place.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, I reckon the <hi>Tigers</hi> which ſtick to the back of the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Wall-Pear-Trees,</hi> and dry them up by ſucking all the green Matter that was in them, among the Incurable Diſtempers; I have imploy'd all manner of ſtrong, ſower, corroſive, ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lees, <hi>Viz.</hi> of Rue, Tabacco, Salt, Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to waſh the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Branches:</hi> I have, by the Advice of ſome of the Curious, imploy'd Oyl; I have ſmoak'd them with

Brimſtone by the Advice of others; I have burnt the Old <hi>Leaves,</hi> I have ſcrap'd the back of the <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>Stem,</hi> to which the Seed ſticks: I daily endeavour to find out ſome new Expedient; and after all, I confeſs freely, and to my ſhame, that I have never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in any of them; there ſtill remains ſome of the Seed of that Curſed Inſect, in ſome part or other: And in the Months of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> this Seed is hatch'd by the heat of the Sun, and then multiplies <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> and therefore one of theſe two things muſt be done; either no <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> muſt be ſuffer'd againſt a Wall, or in <hi>Eſpalier,</hi> which is a violent Remedy, eſpecially for ſmall <hi>Muſcat-Pears, Burgamots,</hi> and Winter <hi>Bon-Chretiens,</hi> which ſeldom thrive from a Wall; or elſe we muſt reſolve to ſee thoſe <hi>Tigers</hi> upon them, contenting our ſelves with burning all the <hi>Leaves</hi> yearly, and with cleanſing the <hi>Trees</hi> as much as is poſſible.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I reckon among the Incurable Diſtempers the Gum, which faſtens to <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> and other <hi>Stone-Fruits;</hi> when it only appears on one <hi>Branch,</hi> it is no great matter, 'tis but cutting the ſaid <hi>Branch</hi> two or three inches below the part ſo Diſtemper'd; whereby this kind of Gangreen is hinder'd from extending farther, as it would Infallibly do, if it ſtuck about the <hi>Graff,</hi> or all over the <hi>Stem,</hi> or on moſt of the <hi>Roots,</hi> and then the ſole Expedient is to loſe no more time about it, and conſequently to remove ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi> out of the Ground, in the manner aforeſaid:</p>
                        <p>The Gum ſometimes proceeds from an external Accident, for inſtance, from a Wound which has been made by way of Inciſion, by a Scratch, and ſometimes from an Evil inward diſpoſition: In the firſt Caſe, that Gum is nothing but a ſpurted <hi>Sap,</hi> which is ſubject to Corruption, and Rottenneſs, from the time it ceaſes to be inclos'd in its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Channels, which lye between the Wood, and the <hi>Bark;</hi> in that Caſe the Remedy is eaſie, eſpecially when it happens only on a <hi>Branch,</hi> as I have declar'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Article, when the Diſtemper affects the <hi>Stem,</hi> it often Cures it ſelf by a knob, or a Continuation of new <hi>Bark,</hi> which extends over the part ſo Wounded; ſometimes it is neceſſary to apply a Plaiſter of Cow-dung over it, cover'd with a piece of Linen, until the Wound be clos'd: When the Gum proceeds from the inſide, I judge it Incurable on the <hi>Stem,</hi> or <hi>Roots.</hi>

                           <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Oratour, conformably to many others among the Learned, who had explain'd themſelves upon that ſubject before him, has taken delight inſpeaking of that Invention, in terms ſo Noble, and ſo Elegant, that Poſterity has been Charm'd with it: In effect, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſingular eſteem he had for it, very agreeably, and yet without ſeeming to inſiſt upon the praiſe of its Ancientneſs, being willing as it were by his ſilence to incline us to believe that the Original of it is hardly known, and that without doubt we are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to Chance for it; and indeed our Books of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> hardly mention any thing capable of giving us any agreeable uſeful inſight into it; for, as for inſtance, what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it to believe, with <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> that we have receiv'd the firſt Idea of <hi>Graffing</hi> from the inſide of the <hi>Trunk</hi> of a <hi>Tree's</hi> having produc'd another <hi>Tree</hi> of a different kind? That Author, who, to maintain his Opinion, lays a great ſtreſs upon that Adventure, delights in reciting the whole Story at length; for which Reaſon, he adds, that a Bird having ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd a whole <hi>Fruit,</hi> had afterwards voided it again accidentally in the hollow of that Old <hi>Tree,</hi> and that the Rains mixing with ſome rotten part of that hollow had made it ſprout and grow, inſomuch that it was become a new <hi>Tree</hi> of the ſame kind of that whence this <hi>Fruits</hi> was Originally grown, which conſequently was abſolutely different from that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                           <p>What ſignifies it likewiſe for me to believe, with <hi>Pliny,</hi> that this Invention of <hi>Graffing</hi> proceeds rather from that a Plough-Man, who was a good Husband, being deſirous to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a piece of Land againſt the Spoils, he dreaded from without, unleſs his Field was well inclos'd, had fenc'd it round about with a Palliſade of green Poles, and that in order to ſecure thoſe Poles from rottenneſs, thereby to make them laſt the longer, he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of laying into the ground round about that Field <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Ivy,</hi> with a deſign to intermix, as he did, the inferiour Extremity of thoſe Poles into the Body of thoſe <hi>Trunks,</hi> from whence it happen'd, contrary to his expectation, that the <hi>Sap</hi> which was in the internal parts of thoſe <hi>Trunks,</hi> ſerv'd for a nouriſhment to thoſe Poles, juſt as if it had been a piece of good <hi>Earth,</hi> inſomuch that in proceſs of time, they grew to be large <hi>Trees.</hi>

                           <p>Now <hi>Pliny</hi> upon this Example, and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> upon the other, lay the Foundation of the Reflections, which, as they ſay, have given birth to the Art of <hi>Graffing;</hi> for my part, far from oppoſing their Arguments, I willingly ſubmit to them, and am very ready to believe that thoſe two Obſervations may have given ſome inſight for <hi>Graffing,</hi> to which I add at the ſame time, that cleft <hi>Graffs</hi> have undoubtedly been practis'd firſt, in imitation <note place="margin">Sunt alii, quos ipſe viâ ſibi rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit uſus. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> of the Peaſants green Poles above mention'd: The ſucceſs of thoſe has ſince put our <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> upon trying new Experiments for <hi>Graffing,</hi> which we find very uſeful; therefore I own that we can never praiſe the firſt Authors of the uſe of <hi>Graffing</hi> too much, nor ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently publiſh our Obligation to them for the main part of the innocent pleaſures <hi>Fruit-Gardens</hi> afford us; for it is moſt certain, that without this admirable Expedient, we ſhould to this hour, be all poor in reſpect to the different kinds of <hi>Fruits,</hi> ſince every body ſhould have been reduc'd to the neceſſity of being ſatisfy'd with ſuch as his Climate, or Chance had afforded him, whether good, or bad: It is the Skill of <hi>Graffing</hi> alone which has made the firſt Curioſo's; the facility of Commerce has ſince increas'd the number <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> by reaſon that People freely and generouſly communitate their choiceſt Production to one <note place="margin">Of all Arts the moſt generous, and moſt proper for a Gentleman is the Art of Husbandry. <hi>Xenophon.</hi>

                           <p>The Hiſtory of Great Men, who have delighted in this Art, has ſufficiently mention'd it, without my inſerting any Particulars about it; therefore I ſhall only ſay, that as the great delight of the Famous <hi>Gard'ner</hi> of the <hi>Georgicks</hi> (which the Poet makes no ſcruple of Comparing to the Pleaſure of Kings) conſiſted in finding at his coming home at night, wherewith to maintain, and treat his Family, without buying any thing, (no body can queſtion but it was with the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Legumes</hi> of his <hi>Garden,</hi> ſeconded by ſome Profits of his <hi>Poultry, Dairy, &amp;c.)</hi> ſo the Pleaſure of our <hi>Curioſo</hi>'s conſiſts in filling their <hi>Gardens</hi> with all manner of good <hi>Trees,</hi> which coſt them nothing, that is, out of their <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> without reckoning the ſatisfaction of being able to preſent them to thoſe Friends they reſpect and value.</p>
                           <p>It were perhaps to be wiſh'd, in the Caſe of <hi>Graffs,</hi> that People had been ſatisfy'd with the bare improvement of that fine Invention, without puſhing it to exceſs, and tormenting themſelves to produce monſtrous <hi>Fruits</hi> by a world of Projects, as ridiculous, as uſeleſs; our Books have endeavour'd to perſwade us about the ſucceſs thereof, but Ingenious Men give but little Credit to them: I believe there are but few, who upon the Report of ſome of the Ancients, have made it their buſineſs to <hi>Graff Vine</hi> upon <hi>Wallnut,</hi> or <hi>Olive-Trees,</hi> in hopes to get Bunches of Oyl, or to <hi>Graff</hi> good <hi>Fruits</hi> upon <hi>Plain-Trees,</hi> or <hi>Aſh,</hi> and <hi>Cherries</hi> upon <hi>Lawrel, Cheſnuts</hi> upon <hi>Beach Trees, Oaks,</hi> upon <hi>Elms, Wallnuts</hi> upon a <hi>Shrub,</hi> and all in hopes of raiſing new kinds of <hi>Fruits;</hi> and therefore, tho' with ſubmiſſion, and reſpect to the memory of Great Men, I muſt needs ſay, that all their Attempts have for the moſt part been faulty; it is ſufficient that all good kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> may be <hi>Graffed</hi> with ſucceſs,

Next, you muſt chuſe a fine Place upon the ſaid <hi>Twig,</hi> having two good <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> looking regularly the one on one ſide, the other on the other, and with your <hi>Graffing-Knife,</hi> or other ſharp Inſtrument you muſt cut the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Piece you are to take off for the <hi>Graff,</hi> Circularly to the very <hi>Wood,</hi> both at the top and bottom; you muſt take off all the <hi>Bark</hi> which covers the ſmalleſt part of the ſaid <hi>Twig,</hi> in order to make that Piece come out there, which is to be taken off after having looſen'd it from its <hi>Wood,</hi> by twiſting it gently with the <hi>Thumb:</hi> But before you take it quite out of its Place, you muſt ſhorten the <hi>Branch</hi> that is to be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon, four or five Inches, and without wounding the <hi>Wood,</hi> you muſt ſtrip it intirely in a very ſound, and very ſmooth place, unto the lower part where the <hi>Graff</hi> is to come, that it may fit it ſo exactly, that it may rather be thought it grew there Naturally, than by Art, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, in order not to permit a ſmall Moiſture which lyes round about the part ſo ſtript, which is the <hi>Sap</hi> newly riſen, to Evaporate, you muſt make an end of taking the piece that is deſign'd for the <hi>Graff,</hi> out of its Place, and Lodge it with all the Diligence, and dexterity imaginable within the <hi>Branch</hi> ſo ſtript, to the place where 'tis to remain, and <note place="margin">Huc aliena ex Arbore ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men includunt, udoque docent inoleſcere libro. <hi>Georg.</hi> 2.</note> finally to hinder the moiſture of the Air from penetrating into the ſpace between the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Branch</hi> that is <hi>Graffed,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> that is newly applied, you muſt raiſe ſmall Shavings out of the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Branch</hi> round about the Superiour Extremity of that <hi>Graff,</hi> without putting them off, and make them hang like a kind of Ruff on the Extremity of that <hi>Bark,</hi> to cover, and ſhelter it from the Injuries of the Air.</p>

                           <p>The Deſcription is likewiſe deficient, in the Fifth place, in not obſerving, that in caſe the <hi>Cleft</hi> be not made very curiouſly, as it happens often, you muſt pare it with your <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Knife,</hi> removing whatever might obſtruct or hinder the <hi>Graff</hi> from entring freely, nay more, in caſe there be cauſe to judge that the <hi>Graff,</hi> by being a little too ſmall, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Stock,</hi> may be a little too much preſs'd, it is neceſſary to pare the wood on both ſides of the <hi>Cleft</hi> very neatly, and very ſmoothly, which is to be done with the point of a very ſharp <hi>Pruning-Knife,</hi> beginning from the lower part upwards, and all this ſo exactly, and ſo conformably to the Figure of the <hi>Branch</hi> that has been cut for the <hi>Cleft Graff,</hi> that after having lodg'd the <hi>Graff,</hi> there may appear no vacuity between it, and the ſides of the <hi>Cleft;</hi> and yet, that the <hi>Graff</hi> may ſtick ſo cloſe, that it may not be eaſie to move it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48210:191"/>
Sixthly, The Deſcription is defective, in not mentioning how many <hi>Graffs</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd upon one <hi>Stock,</hi> and how the upper part of the <hi>Stem</hi> being Cut muſt be prepar'd; large <hi>Stocks,</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> that are to be <hi>Graff'd</hi> in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> muſt be very ſmooth at top, and equal on all ſides, inſomuch that the head may be Horizontal, to place ſeveral <hi>Graffs</hi> upon it, if there be room, and the <hi>Stock</hi> requires it; ſmall <hi>Stocks,</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> that cannot receive above one <hi>Graff,</hi> muſt only be ſmooth'd in one part of the Head; and if that part where the <hi>Graff</hi> is to be apply'd, the remainder muſt be Cut like the Foot of a Hind.</p>
                           <p>Finally, the ſaid Deſcription is defective in not informing us how to ſecure our <hi>Graff'd Trees,</hi> and hinder them from being prejudic'd by the Injuries of the Air, Rains, Heats, and Droughts, through the overtures of the <hi>Cleffs,</hi> whereupon it is to be noted, that all <hi>Cleft Graffs</hi> muſt be ſwadled with fine <hi>Earth,</hi> and Hay newly prepar'd, or elſe with Gum prepar'd to that end, compos'd either of black fat Pitch, melted in an Iron Pot, or <hi>Earth</hi> mix'd with a little yellow Wax, the ſaid Gum muſt be kept hot, and liquid, over a Chaffing-Diſh, to be apply'd with a kind of Wooden Trule; but before you apply either the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> or the Gum, you muſt cover all the Crannies with ſome Barks, immediately looſen'd from ſome <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> that is <hi>Graffed;</hi> they are commonly put croſswiſe on large <hi>Stocks,</hi> or <hi>Graff'd Branches,</hi> in order to cover the <hi>Clefts</hi> ſo well, that nothing may get into them; and whereas we generally cover the <hi>Earth,</hi> and Hay, with a piece of Linnen to keep it fix'd about the Head that is <hi>Graff'd,</hi> which has ſome reſemblance to a Child's Baby, we often call the Cleft <hi>Graff</hi> a Baby-<hi>Graff: Nota,</hi> that when the Stock does not ſeem to preſs the <hi>Graff</hi> ſufficiently, it muſt be bound about with ſome tender Twigs of an Ozier, in order to ſecure the <hi>Graff.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I conclude what relates to Cleft <hi>Graffs,</hi> after having declar'd what I can ſay about Wedges; which is, that before you make uſe of them to open the Cleft, you muſt, in caſe it be a large <hi>Stock,</hi> begin the Cleft with the edge of a pretty large Knife, apply'd upon the whole breadth of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> or <hi>Branch,</hi> ſtriking with a Hammer upon it, in order to make the ſaid edge enter pretty deep into the <hi>Wood,</hi> and thereby mark the <hi>Cleft</hi> in queſtion: <hi>Stocks</hi> of a moderate ſize are eaſily enough <hi>Cleft</hi> with the bare edge of the Knife, without the help of a Hammer.</p>
                           <figure/>
                           <p>The Wedges to be Convenient muſt be made according to the Model of this Figure, one of the Hooks being thicker, longer, and ſtronger than the other, which is to ſerve for large <hi>Stocks,</hi> and the other being both ſhorter, ſmaller, and weaker, for ſmall ones: In order to uſe thoſe Wedges, that which ſeems beſt proportion'd for the <hi>Stock</hi> that is to be <hi>Graffed</hi> upon, muſt be plac'd in the middle of the <hi>Cleft</hi> that is begun, and when it cannot enter ſufficiently, to make the Overture that is neceſſary, it muſt be driven in with a Hammer: In fine, the <hi>Cleft</hi> being partly large enough, to lodge the <hi>Graff</hi> into it, you muſt raiſe or pull down the end of the Tool that ſerves for a Wedge, with the left hand, in the mean time, with the right, placing the <hi>Graff,</hi> Cut as aforeſaid, to the place where it is to remain; and thus you may make an end of ſtretching, or cloſing the <hi>Cleft,</hi> according as you may judge it proper, when the <hi>Graff,</hi> or <hi>Graffs</hi> are plac'd as they ſhould be. I need not tell you, that one <hi>Cleft</hi> may ſerve to place two <hi>Graffs</hi> oppoſite to one another, and when two more can be plac'd, a ſecond <hi>Cleft</hi> may be made Croſwiſe upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> altogether like the firſt, uſing the ſame Method preſcrib'd about the two firſt <hi>Graffs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We ſometimes call it <hi>Graffing</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> when we place four <hi>Graffs Cleftwiſe</hi> upon a <hi>Stock,</hi> that is large enough to receive them Conveniently; but it is more particularly call'd ſo, when upon very large ſhorten'd <hi>Stocks</hi> we place a greater number of <hi>Graffs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Bark,</hi> for inſtance, 6, 7, 8. and therefore this kind of <hi>Graff,</hi> as well as that we call <hi>Whip-Graffing</hi> can only be perform'd upon ſuch <hi>Stocks</hi> as exceed three or four Inches Diameter, which cannot be <hi>Cleft;</hi> but we ſeldom uſe either of them, by reaſon that the ſucceſs is very uncertain, and the trouble of making them very Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48210:191"/>
to that end <hi>Twigs</hi> are us'd about half an Inch Circumference, with four or five good <hi>Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> in their length; they muſt be Cut ſlantingly at the Butt-end, inſomuch that the ſlope may be about an Inch long, and that the upper part of it may be Cut cloſe to the Pitch of the ſaid <hi>Twig,</hi> in order to be as ſmall as poſſible can be at the end, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Sap,</hi> which begins to riſe from the <hi>Foot,</hi> paſſes betwixt the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Graff,</hi> thoſe ſloping ſides muſt be plac'd on the ſide of the <hi>Bark</hi> of the ſhorten'd <hi>Stock,</hi> by which means the <hi>Graff</hi> will receive its nouriſhment. But before you place thoſe <hi>Graffs,</hi> you muſt take out a little of the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Stock</hi> with a ſmall Joyner's Chizzel, from thoſe parts where it is to be plac'd, looſening the <hi>Bark</hi> with a tough Wooden Wedge, ſtriking dextrouſly with a Hammer upon the ſaid Wedge, without prejudicing the <hi>Bark;</hi> the <hi>Graff</hi> being lodg'd, the ſame thing muſt be done, we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to ſecure the <hi>Cleft Graffs</hi> from the injuries of the Air.</p>
                           <p>As for <hi>Whipp-Graffing,</hi> Slopes or Notches muſt be made into the <hi>Bark,</hi> and into the <hi>Wood</hi> of the ſhorten'd <hi>Stocks,</hi> chuſing <hi>Twigs</hi> about an Inch in Circumference, Cutting the <hi>Graffs</hi> in the ſame manner as thoſe that are for the <hi>Cleft,</hi> proportioning the <hi>Twig</hi> ſo Cut, ſo exactly to the Notch of the <hi>Stock,</hi> that it may enter with ſome ſmall difficulty, to the end, that the inſide of the <hi>Barks</hi> may meet exactly, and that no ſpace may remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſides of the <hi>Graff,</hi> and the ſlop'd, or notch'd ſides of the <hi>Stock;</hi> this being done, you muſt take one or two large Oziers to bind the Head ſo <hi>Graffed,</hi> as firm as can be, that the <hi>Graffs</hi> may not eaſily be moved; doing moreover to ſecure the Head from the Injuries of the Air, what we have already preſcrib'd for the <hi>Graffs</hi> in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> and in the <hi>Crown.</hi>

in the Fields, and in <hi>Vineyards</hi> from each others <hi>Suckers,</hi> are very good <hi>Stocks</hi> to <hi>Graff</hi> other Principal kinds upon; <hi>viz.

                           </argument>
                           <p>IT is proper to begin this Chapter, by ſaying that our <hi>Nurſeries</hi> require a good Eaſie Soil, or ground, well Till'd, having at leaſt two Foot and a half Depth; the <hi>Trees</hi> muſt be placed in rows at three Foot diſtance, according to the largeneſs of the <hi>Trees,</hi> and at a Foot and a half, two or three Foot diſtance from one another in the ſaid rows, ſtill according to the proportion of the Sizes: Of all <hi>VVildlings Almonds</hi> are plac'd cloſeſt in the Rows. Tis eaſy to conclude, from what I have been ſaying in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, about all kinds of <hi>Fruits</hi> to be <hi>Graffed,</hi> what kind of <hi>Stocks</hi> are moſt proper to make <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of all kind of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> for <hi>Pears</hi> you muſt Plant <hi>VVildlings</hi> out of <hi>VVoods</hi> and <hi>Foreſts,</hi> or <hi>VVildlings</hi> grown from <hi>Kernels,</hi> or <hi>Suckers</hi> Sprouted from the <hi>Roots</hi> of old <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> or elſe <hi>Plant Quince-Trees,</hi> all which muſt be well Condition'd both as to the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Stem.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Apple-Tree Seminary;</hi> when you deſign to have them <hi>High-Standards,</hi> you muſt <hi>Plant</hi> pretty large <hi>VVildlings,</hi> taken out of <hi>VVoods</hi> and <hi>Forreſts,</hi> to <hi>Graff</hi> them in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> or <hi>Kernel VVildlings</hi> to <hi>Inoculate</hi> them, when they are about two Inches Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, and are to <hi>ſhoot</hi> up, in order to become <hi>High-Standards;</hi> and when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make a <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> you muſt <hi>Plant Paradice-Apple-Trees,</hi> at a Foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the rows: And that, by reaſon that thoſe kind of little <hi>Apple-Trees ſhoot</hi> but few <hi>Roots,</hi> and Conſequently require but little <hi>Room.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To make a <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>Plum-Trees,</hi> you muſt only <hi>Plant</hi> the <hi>Suckers</hi> of certain <hi>Plum-Trees, viz, St. Julian, Black-Damask,</hi> the little <hi>Cherry-Plum,</hi> thoſe that are large enough to bear it, are <hi>Graffed</hi> in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> and the leſſer with the <hi>Scutcheon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Good <hi>Seminaries</hi> for <hi>Peaches,</hi> muſt conſiſt of <hi>St. Julian,</hi> and <hi>Black Damask Plum-Trees,</hi> which muſt be <hi>Inoculated</hi> or <hi>Budded</hi> in the Months of <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or young <hi>Almond-Trees,</hi> that is, <hi>Almond-Trees</hi> grown from an <hi>Almond Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

in good Grounds in the <hi>VVinter</hi> time, grown about <hi>September</hi> following half an Inch thick, to be <hi>Budded</hi> at that time: Old <hi>Almond-Trees</hi> of two or three Years ſtanding are hot proper to be <hi>Graffed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, to make <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of red <hi>Stone-fruit,</hi> viz. <hi>Cherries, Griottes, Bigarreaux;</hi> no <hi>Stocks</hi> are ſo proper as <hi>Meriſiers,</hi> which is a ſmall wild bitter <hi>Cherry,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as beat whitiſh ones; the <hi>Sap</hi> of the black ones is commonly ſo bitter, that the <hi>Graffs</hi> of good <hi>Cherries</hi> do not take upon them, or always pine away.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Suckers</hi> which ſpring from the <hi>Roots</hi> of other <hi>Cherries</hi> may ſerve to <hi>Graff</hi> good <hi>Cherries</hi> upon, but they are moſt proper to be <hi>Graffed</hi> with early <hi>Cherries.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sixthly, <hi>Fig-Tree Seminaries</hi> are Planted with <hi>Suckers</hi> ſprouted from the <hi>Foot</hi> of Old <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> or with <hi>Branches</hi> of two years ſtanding laid into the <hi>Ground,</hi> and notch'd in that part which is moſt bent, and laid into that <hi>Ground.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventhly,</hi> for the <hi>Nurſery</hi> of <hi>Azeroles,</hi> you muſt only Plant <hi>White-Thorn,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Quince-ſtocks.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Eighthly, no <hi>Nurſeries</hi> are made for <hi>Vines,</hi> they are ſeldom <hi>Graffed</hi> otherwiſe than upon Old <hi>Plants,</hi> ready Planted.</p>
                           <p>Finally, for <hi>Medlars,</hi> People ſeldom make any particular <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> the leaſt quantity of them is ſufficient, a dozen <hi>Wildlings</hi> of that kind, or <hi>White-Thorn,</hi> or <hi>Quince-ſtocks;</hi> are ſufficient to provide for the Largeſt <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Before I proceed to the Sixth Part, I think it will not be altogether improper to give my Opinion about the different kinds of <hi>Lattices,</hi> to the end that People may determine at firſt to pitch upon that which I value moſt, and indeed, which is the moſt Noble, and moſt Convenient.</p>

                           <argument>
                              <p>Of the different manners of <hi>Lattices</hi> us'd to <hi>Palliſade.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>FRom the very Moment we reſolve to Encloſe our <hi>Garden</hi> with Walls, we certainly deſign to have <hi>Fruit</hi> againſt them, and conſequently muſt prepare whatever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <note place="margin">Pole Lattices ſet up againſt Walls, much us'd in <hi>France.</hi>
                              </note> to <hi>Palliſade</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> that are to be Planted there, neatly, and Conveniently.</p>
                           <p>The Firſt Obſervation I have made in Relation thereto, is, that one cannot be too careful in having the Walls well Pargetted, or Plaiſtred over when it can be done Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently; in order to ſtop all the holes from <hi>Rats, Snails, Earwigs,</hi> and other Vermin which deſtroy the <hi>Fruits,</hi> and commonly attack the Faireſt, and beſt, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Plague the Curious.</p>
                           <p>When the Walls are Pargetted with Plaiſter, we have the Convenience to Ply, or Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſade the <hi>Branches</hi> with Nails, and Shreads of Sheep's-Skin, or Shamoy, or Liſts of Cloath, both about half a finger broad, and a finger long againſt the ſaid Walls, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Stays about the <hi>Branch,</hi> and fixing it upwards with a Nail, we thus form the Figure of our <hi>Trees.</hi> This manner of <hi>Palliſading</hi> is very agreeable, but tedious; thoſe Shreads may laſt a year or two, the only thing that can be ſaid againſt it is, that ſometimes <hi>Earwigs</hi> ſhelter in them in the day time, and come out at Night, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage the <hi>Trees.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thoſe who are not willing to uſe thoſe Shreads, have try'd three or four ways of <hi>Palliſading,</hi> ſome for all manner of Walls, but eſpecially for ſuch as are made of Earth, and Hey, as they do in <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> ſome fix Spikes from ſpace to ſpace into the <hi>Wall,</hi> ſticking out about two Inches, to faſten Laths, Poles, Perches, or Switches upon them: Others make a <hi>Lattice</hi> of Poles, ſupported by the Bones of Horſes, or Oxen, fix'd into the Wall, to which they faſten the <hi>Branches</hi> of their <hi>Trees:</hi> Others have abundance of Sheeps feet Bones fix'd into their Walls at a ſmall diſtance, in a ſtraight Line, and ſo bind every <hi>Branch</hi> of their <hi>Tree</hi> to one of the ſaid Feet; ſome make a <hi>Lattice</hi> of narrow Laths nail'd a croſs one another checker-wiſe, every ſquare conſiſting of about twelve Inches; and this <hi>Lattice</hi> being made by whole, or half Fathoms, ſeparate, they fix them to the Walls with Nails, or Hooks, that are driven into the joynts of the Stones; it is a pretty good Expedient, but neither Gentile, nor Handſom.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48210:193"/>
Some who yet covet cheapneſs beyond theſe, make a <hi>Lattice</hi> of Braſs or Iron Wire, of a moderate ſize, ſupported by flat-headed Nails fix'd into the Walls. Others have been ſatisfy'd with barely fixing ſtreight Lines of this Wire, either longwiſe, or croſswiſe: Theſe two laſt Methods are pretty neat, but not very good; both by reaſon that they are too weak, inſomuch that the thick <hi>Branches,</hi> that ſometimes require to be forc'd, either break, of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtretch them; and that this Wire is apt to wound and ſcratch the young, and conſequently tender <hi>Branches,</hi> which occaſions Gum to grow upon them, which deſtroys them; beſides, thoſe young Shoots ſlip too eaſily behind thoſe Wires, from whence it is not eaſie to remove them, without ſpoiling of them.</p>
                           <p>The beſt manner of all, the moſt Convenient, and moſt Noble, is a <hi>Lattice</hi> of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wood, or Heart of Oak; every Pole or Lath about an Inch ſquare, and as much as can be without knobs, they muſt be very well plain'd, and notch'd in ſuch places as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; thoſe that are not plain'd, are courſe, and ugly. I confeſs that this <hi>Lattice</hi> is chargeable at firſt, but then it is more laſting, and requires leſs mending: The ſquare fathom of that <hi>Lattice</hi> amounts conſtantly to 25, 26, 27, and 28 Pence, for the Wood, Making, Wire and all.</p>
                           <p>In order to make this <hi>Lattice</hi> as it ſhould be, you muſt have Iron Hooks made on purpoſe, they muſt be ſquare, about a quarter of an Inch thick, and half a Foot long; beſides, the end which turns upwards in a ſtreight Angle, which muſt be above an Inch and a half long, the end which enters into the Wall, muſt be forked, to hold the faſter into the Wall, into which it muſt enter about four Inches deep, two Inches on the outſide will ſuffice.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe Hooks coſt commonly about a Penny a piece, they muſt be plac'd at three foot diſtance, and always Checker-wiſe, beginning the firſt Row within a foot of the ſurface of the Ground, continuing it to the top of the Wall; the rows of thoſe Hooks muſt lie in a ſtreight Line, and parallel to one another; that is all I have to ſay about the Hooks.</p>
                           <p>As to the Poles, or Laths, you may buye them in Shops, of different lengths, <hi>Viz.</hi> Of Four Foot and a half, of Six, Seven, Eight, or Nine; ſome are made of twelve Foot, but ſeldom, becauſe it is too difficult to ſlit ſuch long pieces of Wood; you may take them of what length you pleaſe, according to the heighth of your Walls; they are Sold in Bundles, thoſe of Four Foot and a half, contain Forty, and Coſt Eleven Pence, thoſe of Six, coſt Twelve Pence, and contain Five and Twenty; thoſe of Seven, Eight, and Nine; likewiſe contain Twenty Five, and coſt ſomewhat more.</p>
                           <p>The beſt and moſt uſeful way is to make thoſe that ſtand upwards all of a piece, when you can, but yet you may joyn two or three, ſuch as you can get, and they are much cheaper; they muſt be joyn'd together neatly, plaining and proportioning the Extremities that are to be Marry'd together exactly, tying them afterwards very cloſe with Wire; to which end, you muſt uſe ſmall Pinchers made on purpoſe, with which you may pull the Wire towards you, and turn and wind it until the Ligature be ſtrong enough, then break the end cloſe to the knot, and faſten the ſaid knot againſt the Laths, leſt it ſhould prejudice the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or <hi>Branch.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In chuſing the Poles, or Laths, take the ſtreighteſt, and weakeſt, to ſerve in a ſtreight Line, by reaſon that they always appear on the outſide, placing the Butt-end downwards; the ſtrongeſt muſt be imploy'd croſswiſe to ſupport the Work; the Squares of the <hi>Lattice</hi> muſt be regularly about 7 or 8 Inches, they do not look well of ten or twelve Inches, and in my Opinion, they are too little of 5 or 6 Inches for <hi>Eſpaliers;</hi> but they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for thoſe kind of Arbors, that are of late in faſhion. A good Maker of <hi>Lattice</hi> ſhould never work without a regulated meaſure in hand for his Checkers, meaſuring every one of them carefully; he muſt leave an Inch between the Laths, and the Wall, and when the Hooks are too ſhort, he muſt make uſe of a Wooden Wedge, and hold it between the Laths, and the Wall, in order to have more room to paſs his Wire.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Lattice</hi> muſt not only appear neatly made to the Eye, it muſt alſo be ſolid, which is eaſily known by ſhaking one of the Laths; for it is not as it ſhould be unleſs it reſiſts the hand.</p>
                           <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that you muſt uſe but one ſtraight Lath in Corners, to faſten the two <hi>Lattices</hi> of two Walls that joyn, two would look clumſily, the one on one ſide of a Wall, the other, on the other.</p>
                           <p>The laſt Perfection of our <hi>Lattice</hi> conſiſts in being painted firſt with White, and when that is dry, with a fine Mountain Green.</p>
                           <p>We do not only make <hi>Lattice</hi> frames for <hi>Walls,</hi> we likewiſe make them ſometimes for a kind of <hi>Counter-Eſpalier,</hi> or <hi>Pole-Hedges,</hi> which <hi>Lattice</hi> frames may be made four, five, or ſix foot high, according as you pleaſe: In Order to its being ſolid, it is neceſſary to ſtick
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48210:194"/>
Oaken Spikes into the Ground, at five or ſix foot diſtance from one another, about four Inches ſquare, driving them about a foot deep into the ground, the outward Extremity being pointed, to laſt the longer, for if it were ſquare, the Rain would Rot it the ſooner; as for the ſize, and the place to faſten the Wire, the Checkers muſt be like thoſe of the <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> with this only difference; that in <hi>Pole-Hedges,</hi> the Poles or Laths muſt be fix'd with Nails into the Body of the <hi>Spikes,</hi> which muſt be notch'd in order thereunto.</p>

And therefore ſince <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> have been planted in all times, have I not ſome reaſon to fear, it may appear at firſt, either ridiculous or impertinent for me to ſubjoyn here a particular Treatiſe of that ſort of <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, that I will not deny but that almoſt as ſoon as there were Men upon the Earth, they had ſome kind of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> and that in proceſs of time, the curioſity of their Cultivation has been extreamly augmented, and has made mighty advances, and I am far from pretending, that the firſt ſowing of <hi>Sallets,</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> and planting of <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and <hi>Artichokes,</hi> and rearing of <hi>Cucumbers, Melons,</hi> &amp;c. begun in our days. No, I know well enough, that our <hi>Anceſtours</hi> underſtood what belonged to the Culture of all thoſe plants, and that the moſt part of the very <hi>Country-people,</hi> and of the meaner ſort of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48210:195"/>
of <hi>Cities,</hi> have ſome Tincture of it; nay, and I will ingenuouſly confeſs, that the knowledge I have my ſelf in the management of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> was chiefly attained by my often converſing with what we vulgarly call, able <hi>Market-Gard'ners.</hi> But I muſt add withall that as the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> taken in a general ſence, comprehends the Culture of a great number of different ſorts of Plants, ſo there is hardly any Gard'ner that has made it his Buſineſs, to be skilful in cultivating generally all the ſorts of them; it having ordinarily hapned, that one has applyed himſelf to the care and improvement of one particular part of this culture, which he has performed exactly well, neglecting the reſt, whilſt another has employed his induſtry, no leſs particularly in that which his Neighbour had neglected, and ſucceeded in it, as much ſighting on his ſide, that other part in which the ſame Neighbour had ſo proſperouſly laboured; the different appetites of Men, but more eſpecially, the different goodneſs of Soils and Climates, having been the true cauſes of thoſe different affectations in the Cultivation of <hi>Pot</hi> or <hi>Kitchen-Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now it being undoubtedly neceſſary for a Gentleman's Gard'ner to be able to perform with equal skill and happineſs, all the parts of Culture belonging to a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> that ſo he alone may be in a condition to furniſh his Maſter with all the variety that a good <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> can produce, without wanting at leaſt any of thoſe productions that are of moſt importance, and it being no leſs expedient too for the Gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to know exactly what he may expect from his Gard'ner every Month in the Year, and what is the particular work that is to be done in every Seaſon; I have therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to omit nothing that is neceſſary for either of them to be informed in, that the one may be able to give content by knowing how perfectly well to diſcharge his Duty, and the other be contented, when he knows he has ſufficient Reaſon to be ſo. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, by way of anſwer to thoſe, that may ask me what I pretend to ſay that is new, upon a Subject which I my ſelf confeſs to be ſo very well known,</p>
                        <p>I ſhall firſt repeat the ſame thing which I have already laid down, and inculcated, as my intention in all the parts of this Work, viz. That I write not here for thoſe which are actually Gard'ners by Profeſſion, and that are skillful in it, but for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well of thoſe that have a mind to become ſo, as for Gentlemen that are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Gard'ning, being well aſſured there are a great many of theſe Latter, though ignorant in the particulars of this Science, that eſteem it not unworthy of their Curioſity, and are fully perſwaded it is capable of giving them Pleaſure as well as Profit, and being no leſs certain, that I my ſelf found a great deal in purſuing the acquiſition of thoſe lights I have attained in it, therefore I cannot but think, it will be ſweet and gratefull to them to enjoy without Pains, the Fruits of the ſtudy I have made therein, and to find out an exact and faithful Collection of all that concerns this matter.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Place, I ſhall anſwer, that 'tis my deſign to cut out a ſhorter way than the common Roads, for thoſe young Perſons who though very deſirous of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Art of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> yet would willingly be inſtructed by ſome other means than by bare ſeeing others Practice, it being a tedious and uncertain way, and had rather be taught by ſtated Rules and Principles, which, I think may be done in a little time, and by very ſhort and eaſie methods.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I reply, that I ſhall ſet down here ſome particular experiments which I my ſelf have made with Succeſs, and which ſeem to me never to have been made before, and I think I may add, that they have been too well approved, not to merit to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, I anſwer, that my intention is to give ſuch Directions, that the place deſigned for a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> may be ſo well ordered in all its parts, that not only each part may perform its duty in reſpect of its Productions but by the accurate <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> obſerv'd in modelling of the whole, it may be in a Condition to allure the <hi>Spectators,</hi> and at all times to delight the Eyes of the Curious.</p>
                        <p>And accordingly for theſe Reaſons, I purpoſe here to follow exactly the Model and Platform I have already delineated and explained at the beginning of theſe Treatiſes of Gard'ning, conformably to which, I ſhall ſet down,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, every thing that generally ſpeaking, ſhould be in all ſorts of good and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſht <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> to which I ſhall add a Deſcription of the Seeds and other things which ſerve for the Production and Multiplication of every particular Plant.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, I ſhall ſpecifie not only all the things that may be gathered out of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> every Month of the Year, but alſo what work Gard'ners are to do in every one of thoſe Months, and to thoſe two heads I will joyn another, <hi>viz.</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of what ſhould at all times be found in any <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> whatſoever, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48210:195"/>
ſo we may be able to judge when there is any thing wanting in it, and when not.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I will explain what ſort of Earth or Soil, and what ſort of Culture are moſt proper for each ſort of plants, to make them excellent; and becauſe ſome of them are ſown to remain always in the ſame place, and ſome, only to be tranſplanted elſewhere, and ſome again are propagated without Seed; I will give Directions at the ſame time how to order all of them, as well in reſpect to the Seaſons in which they are to be ſown or planted, as the manner of their Propagation.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, I will ſhew how long each ſort may profitably occupy its place, and which of them muſt be laid up in ſtore for our <hi>Winter</hi> Proviſion, and which may by the help of Induſtry be produced in ſpite of the Froſts.</p>
                        <p>And fifthly and laſtly, I will inform you how long any ſort of Seed will laſt without ſpoiling, they having not all the ſame deſtiny in that Matter.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>ALL the World is agreed, that there are few days in the whole Year in which we can be well without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> whether it be in the fair and fruitful Seaſon, whilſt they are ſtill growing on the Earth that firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, when we have no more to do but to go and gather them there; or in <hi>Winter</hi> when we muſt fetch them out of the Store-rooms, where we had timely laid them up for Security, before the arrival of the bitter cold, which not only makes the Earth unfruitful for a time, but deſtroys too a great part of thoſe Vegetables which are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be within its reach; and therefore it follows, that every day of the Year, we muſt be furniſht with what we need of this Nature, out of our own Gardens of Stores, or elſewhere, either by the liberality of our Friends, or what is moſt common from the Markets.</p>
                        <p>That you may therefore have at one view, the knowledge of what compoſes this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable aſſiſtance, that may be drawn out of the <hi>Kitchen-Garden.</hi> I ſhall here preſent you with a kind of <hi>Alphabetical Inventory</hi> of all the things that ſuch a Garden ſhould, and may furniſh us with, throughout the whole courſe of the year.</p>

                        <p>THe Experience of hot Countries ſufficiently convinces us, that the <hi>Earth</hi> taken in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is capable at all Seaſons, to produce all manner of things, without any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſiſtance of <hi>Art,</hi> becauſe in thoſe parts, there is no Seaſon in the Year, in which ſhe is not teeming, but by a contrary experience we find, that our <hi>Climate</hi> is too cold to afford us any ſuch fertility; and yet becauſe there are few days, in which a Man has not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make up a part of his nouriſhment and ſubſiſtance with ſomething of the growth of his Garden; It concerns the induſtrious Gard'ners ſo to manage it, that it may not only produce enough amply to ſuffice for our daily uſe, during the five or ſix Months in which the <hi>Earth</hi> acts at her Eaſe, by the favour of the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Neighbourhood, but alſo furniſh us at the ſame time, a ſufficient Proviſion for thoſe five or ſix Months in which ſhe is ſuſpended from her ordinary functions.</p>
                        <p>Now among the Barren and leſs happy Months that commonly make the greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to our Culture, are reckoned the laſt fifteen days of <hi>November,</hi> all <hi>December,</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> and the firſt fifteen days of <hi>February;</hi> the violence of the Froſts which in that Seaſon uſe to harden and cool the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the abundance of Snow with which it is then wont to be covered, putting ſuch a perfect ſtop to all Vegetative Operations, that the moſt fertile Soil becomes at that time altogether like that which never was bleſſed with that accompliſhment.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48210:200"/>
But notwithſtanding all thoſe hindrances, there is ſtill work enough to be done in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to keep us from being quite idle, and a great deal of Aſſiſtance too to be drawn from our Gardens, even in that Seaſon, that we may not labour under too great a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Productions; and therefore I have determined to give you a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every one of thoſe works, and of every one of thoſe Commodities which our Gardens will afford us, during every one of the twelve Months of the Year, and ſhall begin with that which, becauſe it paſſes for the firſt, and opens and begins the Year, ſeems to me beſt to deſerve the preference.</p>

                              <p>But it would be to little Purpoſe to know what to do, without being informed how to do it, and therefore for your inſtruction in pruning, I referr you to my fourth Book, which treating throughly of that Subject, may excuſe me from ſpeaking any more of it here.</p>
                              <p>And as to the way of making <hi>hot Beds,</hi> you muſt firſt know, they are to be made only with <hi>Long Horſe-Dung,</hi> or <hi>Mule-Dung,</hi> which is to be either all <hi>New,</hi> or mixed with a third part at moſt of <hi>Old,</hi> provided it be dry, and not rotten, for that which is rotten, is not at all proper for making <hi>hot Beds,</hi> no more than the Dung of <hi>Oxen, Cows, Hogs,</hi> &amp;c. as well, becauſe it has little or no heat, as becauſe ordinarily thoſe kinds of rotten Dung are accompanied with an unpleaſing ſmell that infects the Plants raiſed upon ſuch <hi>Beds,</hi> and gives them an ugly Taſte.</p>
                              <p>By <hi>New Long Dung,</hi> is to be underſtood, that which is taken from under the <hi>Horſes,</hi> and has ſerved them for <hi>Litter</hi> but one Night or two at moſt.</p>
                              <p>By <hi>Long old Dung,</hi> is meant that which has been piled up ever ſince it was new, in a dry place where it has lain all Summer, to be ready to be uſed, either to make Coverings for <hi>Fig-trees, Artichoaks, Endive,</hi> &amp;c. againſt the <hi>Winter</hi> Cold, or to make <hi>hot Beds</hi> after the ordinary manner, which is thus performed.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48210:200"/>
After we have mark'd and proportioned out the place where the <hi>Bed</hi> is to be, and mark'd out likewiſe with a Cord, or with Stakes, of what breadth it muſt be, there muſt be brought a Rank of Baskets full of <hi>Long Dung,</hi> one at the tail of the other, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Rank or Row where the <hi>Bed</hi> is to end; which done, the Gard'ner begins to work where the Rank of Baskets ends, that ſo the <hi>Dung</hi> not being intangled with any thing lying upon it, may more eaſily and handſomly be wrought into the <hi>Bed.</hi> Then the Gard'ner takes up this <hi>Dung</hi> with a Fork, and if he be any thing handy, places it ſo neatly and tightly in laying every layer of his <hi>Bed,</hi> that all the ſtraw ends of the <hi>Dung,</hi> are turned inwards, and what remains, ſerves to make a kind of back or fence on the out-ſide. The firſt layer being thus compleated exactly to the breadth that is marked out, which is commonly of about four foot, and to ſuch a length as is thought fit, the Gard'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proceeds to lay the ſecond, third, &amp;c. beating them with the back of his Fork, or elſe treading them with his Feet, to ſee if there be any defect, becauſe the <hi>Bed</hi> muſt be equally ſtuft every where, ſo that no one part may be leſs ſtrong of <hi>Dung</hi> than another, which being done, he continues it to the deſigned length, proportioning it ſtill by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, till the <hi>Bed</hi> reach the length, breadth, and heighth it ſhould have, which heighth is of between two and three foot when 'tis firſt made, and ſinks a full foot lower when it is ſetled.</p>
                              <p>Now as to the intention of theſe <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> ſome of them are deſigned for the raiſing, or forwarding of ſome plants which our <hi>Climate</hi> is not capable naturally of producing in the naked Ground, as for example, for the raiſing of <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> little <hi>Sallets, Straw-berries, Cucumbers, Musk-Melons,</hi> &amp;c. and the better to compaſs thoſe ends, we make <hi>Hot Beds</hi> during the Months of <hi>November, December, January, February, March</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> Theſe Beds muſt be covered over with a certain quantity of ſmall fine mold, as we ſhall afterward Direct, and muſt have heat enough to communicate to that mold, and to the plants that are nouriſhed by it; And therefore thoſe <hi>Hot Beds</hi> that are an Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gard'ners againſt the <hi>Cold,</hi> which is the cruel Enemy of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> muſt be well made.</p>
                              <p>In the ſecond place, there are other <hi>Beds</hi> which are to ſerve for <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> in all the ſeaſons of the Year, and ſuch may be made every Month, though they act not till about three Months after they are made; and that is, when all their great heat being quite ſpent, they are grown mouldy within; this ſort of <hi>Beds</hi> are made in a new and ſandy Ground, in which is firſt made a Trench of about ſix Inches deep, then we cover them with a layer of about two or three Inches thick of the ſame Earth; they are raiſed in the form of an <hi>Aſſes back,</hi> and over the covering of Earth, we lay another of five or ſix In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick of <hi>Long Dry Dung,</hi> which ſerves in <hi>Winter,</hi> to ſhelter the <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> from the <hi>Froſt,</hi> which deſtroys them: and in <hi>Summer,</hi> from the great heat that broils them, and likewiſe to prevent the miſchievous effects of the ſame exceſſive heat, we further take care gently to water theſe <hi>Muſhroom Beds</hi> twice or thrice a week.</p>
                              <p>As for the breadth of <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> it ſhould be in all ſorts of them, of about four foot, and their heighth muſt be of between two and three when they are firſt made, becauſe they ſink afterwards a full foot, when once the great heat of the <hi>Bed</hi> is paſt; As for the length that is to be regulated by the quantity of <hi>Dung</hi> we have to make them with, ſo that according to that, we make them of ſeveral lengths; But in heighth and breadth, all <hi>Beds</hi> ſhould be as near as may be, alike proportioned.</p>
                              <p>The difference which there is in other reſpects, between <hi>Hot Beds</hi> that are to produce plants by their heat, and thoſe which are deſigned for <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> conſiſts firſt in that thoſe of the firſt ſort need not be ſunk down within the Earth like the others, which are uſually ſunk about half a foot, unleſs they be deſigned for ſuch <hi>Beds</hi> as we call <hi>Deaf Beds,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Beds</hi> ſunk ſo over <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> into the Earth, that when filled up, they exceed not the ſuperficies of the reſt of the Ground about them, in height. In the ſecond place, this difference conſiſts, in that thoſe of the firſt ſort muſt be flat and even above, whereas theſe others muſt be raiſed in form of an <hi>Aſſes Back.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Laſtly, it conſiſts in that thoſe of the firſt ſort muſt be Loaden with a pretty good quantity of very ſmall mold, as ſoon as they are made, whereas there muſt be but a very little mold laid upon the others; That mold by its weight, makes the <hi>Beds</hi> heat, and ſettle the ſooner. We lay upon them ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs mold; as for Example, we throw on to the quantity of ſix or ſeven Inches thick, if it be to ſow ordinary plants in, as <hi>Sallets,</hi> or <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> or <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> or to plant <hi>Cabbage Lettuce,</hi> and <hi>Aſparagus</hi> to be advanced by heat; and to the depth of a foot, if we be to ſow <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes,</hi> and to replant <hi>Sorrel,</hi> and <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> and pots of <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48210:201"/>
But before we ſow or replant any thing whatſoever upon any new made <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> the firſt precaution we muſt obſerve, is, to ſtay ſix or ſeven days, and ſometimes ten or twelve, to give the <hi>Bed</hi> time firſt to heat, and afterwards to give time to that heat which is very violent, to abate conſiderably; This abatement appears when the whole <hi>Bed</hi> is ſunk, and when thruſting down our hand into the mold, we perceive in it but a moderate heat. Then it is we are to begin handſomly to ſhape out and adjuſt the mold, for which purpoſe the Gard'ner, makes uſe of a board of a foot broad, which he places upon the ſides of the <hi>Bed</hi> about two Inches from the Edge, and joining cloſe to the mold, and having thus placed it, he endeavours to keep it firm and tight, as well with his left hand and Knee, as with the ſtrength of his whole Body, and then with his right hand, he begins at one end, to preſs down the mold againſt the board, ſo hard, till he bring it to ſo firm a conſiſtence, that how light and looſe ſoever it were before of its own Nature, yet it may be able to keep up it ſelf alone, when the board is taken away, as well as if it were a ſolid body. When the mold is thus adjuſted to the whole length of the board, then he removes the board to another place, and ſo continues till he has performed the ſame operation on all ſides of the <hi>Bed.</hi> And if the board be a little longer, and conſequently a little more unwieldy than ordinary, then there muſt two or three perſons join together to work in the ſame manner, and at the ſame time, to adjuſt this mold; or if the Gard'ner be all alone, he muſt keep the board tight with ſome Pins, faſtned in the ſides of the Dung <hi>Bed</hi> already adjuſted; And when the thing is done, the mold ſhould have at leaſt a full half foot extent leſs on every ſide, than the lower part of the <hi>Bed,</hi> and in its oblong ſquare figure, appear as even as if it were a <hi>Bed</hi> formed on the plain Ground; After which, the <hi>Beds</hi> are to be employed for thoſe occaſions that firſt obliged us to make them. All things in them would either periſh, or be much endamaged, if we ſowed or planted in them ſooner, or if we ſhould delay our doing it any longer. The heat of the <hi>Bed,</hi> may laſt in a condition to be able to perform well its effects for about ten or twelve days after it is ſown or planted; but when that time is paſt, if we perceive the <hi>Bed</hi> to be too much cooled, we muſt renew the heat with ſome good new long dung, or freſh warm litter applied round about it, both to recruit the heat, and to maintain it afterwards in that good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in which it ſhould be, and in which it was before, when we begun to ſow and plant there; ſo that the plants inſtead of waſting away or periſhing there, may increaſe and thrive viſibly as they ſhould do. It is not ſo very needful to tell you, that when a man has two <hi>Beds</hi> next one another, one recruiting of heat will ſerve for them both, becauſe there's no body but knows it, but it is good to know, that this recruiting of heat between two <hi>Beds,</hi> ſhould not be by a great deal ſo ſtrong as when there is but one; for the ordinary Interval or ſpace left between two <hi>Beds</hi> for the path, being about the breadth of one full foot, a little Dung will ſuffice to fill it up, and that new heat is reciprocally maintained in its vigour by the Neighbour-hood of the two <hi>Beds,</hi> that border on each ſide upon it; But when there is but one <hi>Bed,</hi> our addition of Dung for a new heat, muſt be at leaſt two foot broad, all along the whole length of the <hi>Bed,</hi> and to its full height, and many times it muſt be higher than that.</p>
                              <p>When we are to renew the heat, it is not always neceſſary to make an application of new Dung, it being many times ſufficient to ſtir that the bottom upwards, which we laſt applied, and which needs it, provided it be not too much rotted, which ſtirring of it is enough to renew the heat for eight or ten days longer; and there is no need of applying new Dung but when by the rotting of all the laſt, or of at leaſt a good part of it, we find it to be no longer fit to yield that heat which is neceſſary for thoſe plants that are raiſed on <hi>Hot Beds.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If they be <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> or <hi>Straw-berries</hi> which we have taken out of their <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> and replanted in <hi>Hot ones,</hi> and there be any apprehenſion of the Cold, we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cover them with <hi>Glaſs Bells,</hi> or <hi>Chaſſes</hi> or <hi>Glaſed Frames;</hi> and to hinder the <hi>Froſt</hi> from penetrating even them, and ſpoiling what is underneath them, we uſe beſides to cover them with Screens of dry Long Dung, or Litter, or <hi>Straw,</hi> which we put over the <hi>Glaſs Bells</hi> or <hi>Glaſed Frames,</hi> and plants never fail to produce upon <hi>Beds</hi> thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated and maintained in a due heat, by ſuch recruitings Renewed from time to time.</p>
                              <p>This manner of proceeding is good and commodious enough for <hi>Sorrel;</hi> becauſe being animated by the moderate heat of the <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> it ſprings up there for ſome fifteen days time, juſt as that do's that grows in the naked Ground in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and afterwards dies; But it is not ſo good for <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> becauſe they when they are pull'd
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48210:201"/>
up and Replanted, never produce ſuch fine Shoots, as when they are Dunged and heat on the naked Earth.</p>
                              <p>It follows then, that the beſt method for <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> and even for <hi>Sorrel</hi> too, is to take up for about two foot deep, all the Earth in the paths between two cold <hi>Beds,</hi> (which paths ſhould be a full foot broad) and fill them up afterwards with Long <hi>Warm</hi> Dung, to heat the neighbouring Earth, and if it be for <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> to cover the whole <hi>Cold Bed</hi> with the ſame Dung, to help to warm the Earth; And when the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> begin to ſprout, we put <hi>Bells</hi> upon each plant, or elſe cover the whole <hi>Bed</hi> with <hi>Glaſed Frames;</hi> after which, the heat of theſe paths muſt be renewed by ſtirring them the bottom upwards, or by renewing from time to time an application of freſh Dung, covering beſides the <hi>Bells</hi> or <hi>Glaſs Frames</hi> with dry long Dung, or Screens of <hi>Straw,</hi> or ſuch like matter, for the reaſons above expreſſed, when we were treating of <hi>Aſparagus</hi> and <hi>Sorrel</hi> in <hi>Hot Beds.</hi> The <hi>Aſparagus</hi> plants being thus warmed, and feeling under thoſe <hi>Bells</hi> or <hi>Glaſs Frames</hi> an Air as comfortable as in the Months of <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> they produce ſhoots that are Red at firſt comming up, but which afterward turn green and long, like thoſe that <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf produces in warm and temperate ſeaſons. The only inconvenience of theſe Artificial heatings is, that becauſe they muſt be very violent to penetrate a Cold Earth, they dry up and ſpoil thoſe plants, ſo that ſuch <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> inſtead of continuing for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years together, to bear well as otherwiſe they do, never ſpring kindly afterward, and though they be let alone two or three years after a firſt heating, yet at moſt, are able to endure but one more.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Straw-berries</hi> which are forced on <hi>Hot Beds</hi> begin to put out their ſhoots in <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and Flower in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and yield their Fruit in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May.</hi> The beſt method of raiſing them, is to pot them in <hi>September,</hi> in a tolerable good and light Earth, and afterwards to plant them in <hi>Hot Beds</hi> in <hi>December;</hi> they may alſo be planted in <hi>Hot Beds</hi> without potting at all, in the Month of <hi>March;</hi> their runners and ſome of their leaves muſt be taken off, if they have too many; the Earth in their Pots muſt be kept always looſe and a little moiſt, and if there happen any exceſſive heats in ſome days of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> they muſt have a little Air given them towards the <hi>North,</hi> and they muſt be covered a Nights.</p>
                              <p>To have little <hi>Sallets</hi> of <hi>Lettuce</hi> to cut, mixed with <hi>Chervil, Creſſes,</hi> &amp;c. with the furnitures of <hi>Mint, Taragon,</hi> &amp;c. and to have <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> &amp;c. we make ſuch <hi>Hot Beds</hi> as I have directed, and we ſteep in water about twenty four hours, a little bagg of <hi>Lettuce</hi> Seed, after which time, we take it out, and hang it in a chimny corner, or in ſome other place where the <hi>Froſt</hi> can't reach it, and the Seed ſo wetted, drains it ſelf from the water, and heats to ſuch a meaſure, that it ſprouts, and then after we have made upon our <hi>Hot Beds</hi> ſome little furrows of about two Inches deep, and about as broad, with a little ſtick that we draw hard over the mold, we ſow that ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Seed in thoſe furrows, ſo thick that it covers all the bottom of the furrows; There muſt be a <note n="*" place="margin">A <hi>French Buſhel</hi> is 20 Pound weight, or near a peck and half Engliſh.</note> 
                                 <hi>French Buſhel</hi> to ſow a <hi>Bed</hi> of fourteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms</hi> long, and of four foot broad, and when 'tis ſown, we cover it with a little mold caſt upon it lightly with the hand; and each caſt of the hand dextrouſly performed, ſhould cover a furrow as much as it needs, which done, we put ſome Bells or long Rice Straw over them to hinder the Birds from Eating them, and the heat from evapourating, or the Froſt by chilling it, from deſtroying the Seed, we take away the Straw when at the end of five or ſix days, the Seed begins to ſpring well, and at length, ten or twelve days after it is commonly high enough to be cut with a Knife, and eaten in <hi>Sallets,</hi> that is to be underſtood, if the Ice and Snow, and even the heat of the <hi>Bed</hi> be not too exceſſive. We take the ſame courſe with <hi>Chervil,</hi> and <hi>Creſſes,</hi> ſave only that they muſt be ſown without ſteeping their Seeds.</p>

                              <p>As for <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> we ſeldom ſteep them to make them ſprout, the skins of their Seeds being ſo tender, that in leſs than a days time, they would be melted all to a Pap.</p>
                              <p>I have directed how to ſow <hi>Roaiſhes,</hi> in the Works of <hi>November,</hi> where we treat of preparing the proviſions we would have from our <hi>Gardens</hi> in <hi>January, February,</hi> and <hi>March.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It is convenient to ſow in the beginning of this Month, or even in <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> of <hi>Parſley</hi> to ſupply us with freſh, in the <hi>Spring</hi> time to ſerve us till that we ſhould ſow in the naked Earth, at the end of <hi>February,</hi> be grown to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="152" facs="tcp:48210:202"/>
To lay the branches or ſlips of <hi>Vines, Fig-Trees, Gooſe-berry</hi> and <hi>Curran Buſhes,</hi> to take Root, we need only Couch, or lay down their branches into the Earth and cover them in the middle with Earth, to the height of five or ſix Inches, which are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that condition, till the month of <hi>November</hi> following, when having taken Root, we take them up, that is, ſeparate them from the Tree, and plant them where we have occaſion for them.</p>
                              <p>To <hi>Circumpoſe</hi> Trees by planting them in <hi>Baskets, Pots,</hi> and <hi>Boxes,</hi> or <hi>Caſes,</hi> we firſt fill half way with Earth thoſe <hi>Baskets, Pots,</hi> or <hi>Boxes,</hi> and then having pruned and trim'd the Trees as I have directed in the Treatiſe of Plantations, we Plant them, plunging the <hi>Baskets</hi> and <hi>Pots</hi> quite into the Earth, but leaving the <hi>Boxes</hi> or <hi>Caſes</hi> above Ground:</p>
                              <p>The way of potting the <hi>Bulbous</hi> Roots of <hi>Tubereuſes, Juncquills, Narciſſus</hi>'s of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Jacynths,</hi> &amp;c. is firſt to put them into <hi>Pots,</hi> and then to plunge thoſe <hi>Pots</hi> into <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> covering the <hi>Beds</hi> carefully with <hi>Glaſs Frames, Bells, Straw Screens,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>To warm or force <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> we muſt have ſome in <hi>Boxes</hi> or <hi>Caſes,</hi> and make for them in <hi>January,</hi> a <hi>Deaf Hot Bed</hi> (being a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> made in a hollow dug into the Earth, and raiſed only even with its ſurface) and place the <hi>Boxes</hi> upon it. Then we muſt have ſome ſquare <hi>Glaſs Frames</hi> about ſix or ſeven foot high, which muſt be fitted purpoſely to be applied againſt a <hi>Wall</hi> expoſed to a <hi>Southern Aſpect:</hi> And ſo the Dung in the <hi>Hot Bed</hi> fermenting into a heat, warms the Earth in the <hi>Box,</hi> and by conſequence, makes the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> ſprout; That <hi>Bed</hi> is to be put into a new ferment when there is occaſion, and great care muſt be taken to cover thoſe <hi>Glaſs Frames</hi> cloſe, that no <hi>Cold</hi> may get within them.</p>
                              <p>During the whole Month of <hi>January</hi> we continue to ſow upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> under <hi>Bells, Lettuces</hi> to be Replanted again as I have directed in the Works of <hi>December;</hi> as alſo to Replant them under <hi>Bells,</hi> as well to ſerve for the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> as in the places they are deſigned for, and as to the Seeds when ſown, we may let alone covering them with mold, if we pleaſe, it being enough to pat with the flat of our hands upon the <hi>Bed,</hi> to preſs the mold cloſe about them; we uſe the ſame method with <hi>Purſlain</hi> ſown under <hi>Bells,</hi> for we can hardly throw ſo little mold upon thoſe Seeds to cover them, but we ſhall through too much.</p>
                              <p>To have ſome fine little <hi>Lettuces</hi> for <hi>Salleting,</hi> we muſt ſow under <hi>Bells</hi> ſome of the <hi>Bright curled</hi> ſort, and ſow it thin, and ſtay till it has ſhot forth two leaves before we gather it. The Seeds of theſe <hi>Lettuces</hi> muſt be ſown thin, that the Plants may grow tall, and if we ſee them come up too thick, we muſt thin them; the choiſeſt ſorts of <hi>Lettuce</hi> for the <hi>Spring</hi> ſeaſon, are the <hi>Curled Fair</hi> or <hi>Bright Lettuce,</hi> and after that, the <hi>Royal Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>Short Lnttuce,</hi> and above all, the <hi>Shell Lettuce,</hi> &amp;c. We alſo ſow under <hi>Bells,</hi> to Replant again, <hi>Borage, Bugloſs,</hi> and <hi>Arach,</hi> or <hi>Orage.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The right method of making Trenches, and diging of molds, is not as was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practiſed, firſt, to throw out of thoſe Trenches all the Earth, and then to throw it in again; for that was unprofitably to handle the ſame Earth twice, and ſo to loſe time, and ſpend money to no purpoſe.</p>
                              <p>The beſt way to do it then, is to make at firſt a Gage full as broad as the Trench and of the length of a <hi>Toiſe</hi> or <hi>Fathom,</hi> and to throw up upon the bordering Alley, all the Earth that is taken out of that <hi>Gage,</hi> which will be all the Earth we ſhall need handle twice, becauſe at the end of the Trench there will remain one <hi>Gage,</hi> empty, which muſt be filled up with the Earth that came out of the firſt, when the firſt <hi>Gage</hi> is made, we muſt fill it up with the Earth that is to be dug up to make the next, throwing that part of it into the bottom which was at the <hi>Superficies,</hi> and making a new <hi>Superficies</hi> of that which was at the bottom; This kind of moving the Ground, makes a natural Slope before the Workman, and in caſe the Soil muſt be Dunged, we muſt have Dung ready placed all along the ſide of the Trench, and whilſt two or three men are at Work in turning up the Earth, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it before them, there muſt be one at the ſide of the Trench, to ſcatter Dung upon that Slope by which means the mold is well mixed, and not at all tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, as it is by common Gard'ners, that firſt lay a layer of Dung, and then a layer of Earth, and afterwards dig the whole over again, continuing this way of laying of layers of Dung and mold, and to turn up one over another, till their Trench be quite filled up as 'tis to remain.</p>

                              <p>IN this Month, we continue the ſame works we were doing in the laſt, if we have had the foreſight and convenience to begin them then, or elſe at leaſt we ſet upon beginning them now in earneſt.</p>
                              <p>Therefore we ſet to manuring the Ground if the <hi>Froſt</hi> permits us, and about the end of the Month, or rather to wards <hi>Mid-March,</hi> or later, that is towards <hi>Mid-April,</hi> we ſow in the naked Ground thoſe things that are long a rearing; as for Example, all ſorts of Roots, viz. <hi>Carrots, Parſnips, Chervils</hi> or <hi>Skirrets, Beet-Raves,</hi> or <hi>Red-Beet-Roots, Scorzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neres,</hi> and above all, <hi>Parſly-Roots.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We ſow now alſo <hi>Onions, Leeks, Ciboules, Sorrel, Haſting Peas, Garden</hi> or <hi>Marſh-Beans, Wild Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> and <hi>Burnet.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If we have any <hi>Shell-Lettuces</hi> that were ſown in <hi>Autumn</hi> laſt, in ſome well ſheltered place, we now replant them on <hi>Hot Beds</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> to make them <hi>Cabbage</hi> betimes. And particularly we take care to replant on them ſome of the <hi>Curld Bright Lettuces,</hi> which we ſowed laſt Month, becauſe they turn to better account than the others.</p>
                              <p>We begin at the latter end of the Month, to ſow a little green <hi>Purſlain</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> the <hi>Red,</hi> or <hi>Golden</hi> ſort being too delicate and tender to be ſown before <hi>March.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Cowcumbers</hi> and <hi>Musk-melons,</hi> if we have any big enough, and that upon a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> in ſome place well ſheltered, either by Walls, Straw or Reed Hedges, or ſome other Invention to keep off the Wind.</p>
                              <p>We alſo ſow towards the end of the Month, our <hi>Annual Flowers,</hi> in order to replant them again at the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We alſo ſow our firſt <hi>Cabbages,</hi> if as we ſhould, we have not a proviſion of ſome in a <hi>Nurſery</hi> under ſome good ſhelter, which we ſhould have ſown at the beginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and replanted in <hi>October</hi> in the <hi>Nurſery;</hi> we replant theſe latter in the places they are deſigned for, taking care not to replant any that begins to run to Seed.</p>
                              <p>We begin to Graft all ſorts of Trees in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> and we prune and plant them; we plant alſo <hi>Vines,</hi> and about <hi>Mid-February,</hi> if the weather be any thing fair, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time to begin all ſorts of Works.</p>
                              <p>We only make now the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> which we have occaſion to make uſe of for <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> little <hi>Sallets,</hi> and to raiſe thoſe things which we are to replant again in the <hi>Cold Beds.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We take care to maintain the neceſſary heat about our <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> and to gather thoſe that are good.</p>
                              <p>As alſo to maintain the Heat in the <hi>hot Strawberry Beds.</hi>

                              <p>We unnail our <hi>Wall-trees</hi> in order to prune them the more commodiouſly, and then nail them up anew.</p>
                              <p>At what time ſoever <hi>Radiſhes</hi> are gathered, they muſt be tied up in Bunches, and put to ſteep in Water, or elſe they will wither, and retain too biting a taſte.</p>

                              <p>AT the beginning of this Month, it appears who are the Gard'ners that have been idle, by their not furniſhing us with any thing which the diligent and skilful ones ſupply us with, and by their having neglected to ſow their Grounds which lie for the moſt part as yet unſown, though the weather has been favourable for it. There is now no more time to be loſt in delaying the ſowing of the firſt Seeds that are to be ſown in the naked Earth, and of which we have ſpoken in the Works to be done about the end of <hi>February.</hi> Good Gard'ners ought to cover with Mold, the <hi>Cold Beds</hi> which they have ſown with their deſigned Seeds, for fear the waterings and great Rains ſhould beat down the Earth too much, and render its Superficies too hard for the Seeds to pierce and ſhoot through; they ſhould alſo bank up their cold Beds tightly with a rake, that ſo the Rain water, or that of their waterings may keep in them, and not run out of them into the Paths; and in fine, if they have never ſo little of the Spirit of Neatneſs in them, they will not fail to take away all the Stones the Rake meets with in its way.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="154" facs="tcp:48210:203"/>
The way to cover well all theſe Seeds with Earth, is to harrow or rake, that is, to move it extreamly to and fro, which is commonly done with an Iron Rake.</p>
                              <p>About <hi>Mid-March</hi> at furtheſt, we make the <hi>hot Beds</hi> in which we are to replant the earlieſt <hi>Musk melons.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We ſow in the naked Earth, in ſome well ſheltered place, all thoſe things which we are to plant again in the like; as for Example, both our Spring <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and that which we are to replant again at the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> viz. the <hi>Curl'd Bright Lettuce,</hi> and the <hi>Royal,</hi> and <hi>Bellegarde Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>Perpignan Lettuce</hi> which is greeniſh, the <hi>Alfange,</hi> the <hi>Chicons,</hi> and the <hi>Green, Red</hi> and <hi>Bright Genua Lettuces</hi> are near two Months on the Ground, before they grow big enough to be replanted. And we alſo ſow <hi>Cabbages</hi> for the latter Seaſon, and <hi>Collyflowers</hi> to plant them in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, about the end of <hi>April</hi> and beginning of <hi>May;</hi> and if they come up too thick, we take out ſome, and replant them in a <hi>Nurſery,</hi> to make them grow bigger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We ſow <hi>Radiſhes</hi> in the naked Earth, among all the other Seeds we are ſowing, becauſe they do no harm there, but are fit to be gathered at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> before either the <hi>Sorrel, Chervil, Parſly, Ciboule, &amp;c.</hi> be grown big enough to ſuffer any incommodity by them.</p>
                              <p>We ſow <hi>Arrach,</hi> or <hi>Orage,</hi> in the naked Earth.</p>
                              <p>About <hi>Mid-March,</hi> we ſow <hi>Citruls</hi> or <hi>Pompions</hi> upon <hi>hot Beds,</hi> to replant in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Commonly there is nothing fit to be replanted in <hi>Cold Beds</hi> at their coming out of the hot ones, till the end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> unleſs it be <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and the Earth muſt be a little warmed before we remove any thing into it out of a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> in which the Plants were ſtill cheriſhed with ſome remaining heat, or elſe they will all come to nothing there.</p>
                              <p>We make an end of pruning and planting during the courſe of this Month, of all Garden-Trees, and alſo of <hi>Gooſeberry, Curran,</hi> and <hi>Raſpberry ſhrubs,</hi> &amp;c. It is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to delay the pruning of vigorous Trees till they begin to ſprout, as well to let them ſpend their firſt Strength, as to prevent the loſing any of their Fruit Buds which we cannot till then diſcern, and which come to their perfection in the Spring-Seaſon.</p>
                              <p>We take up at the beginning of the Month, with Mold and all, the <hi>plantation</hi> of <hi>Strawberrys,</hi> which we had in the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> to form <hi>Cold Beds</hi> and Squares of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and to refurniſh thoſe where there want any.</p>
                              <p>We ſow ſome ſeed of <hi>piercepier</hi> or <hi>Garden Sampire</hi> in ſome tub of Earth, or in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Ground ſome ſheltered place; it requires commonly two Months to come up, and when it is big enough, we replant it in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and ſometimes we let it grow till the next year, in order to replant it at the foot of ſome Wall.</p>
                              <p>We ſow a third time a few more <hi>Peas,</hi> for we ſhould be ſure to ſow ſome of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Month of the Year, and theſe now ſown muſt be of the great ſquare ſort.</p>
                              <p>We now have ſome <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> either upon ſome <hi>Hot Beds</hi> made purpoſely for them, or in ſome other places well dunged.</p>
                              <p>At the very beginning of the Month, we ſow ſome little quantity of <hi>Endive</hi> very thin, to have ſome of it whited about <hi>Mid-ſummer.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>When we know that the Paths between <hi>hot Beds,</hi> or <hi>Aſparagus</hi> Banks, have been ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with very long Dung, ſo that there ſeems not to be heat enough in them, and if it be very hot weather, it is convenient to water them reaſonably well, that ſo the Straw in them being wetted, may the more eaſily ferment into a heat.</p>
                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, or at the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> we ſow a little <hi>Cellery</hi> in the naked <hi>Earth,</hi> to have ſome late in the Months of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September. Cellery</hi> is commonly almoſt a Month a coming up; and we ſow a little of it at the ſame time on a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> in order to have ſome of it early.</p>
                              <p>We digg about the Roots of Fruit-Trees, that we may have finiſht that work before they bloſſom; the <hi>Froſt</hi> being more dangerous in Soils newly moved and turned up than in others.</p>
                              <p>We begin now to uncover a little our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> but ſeldom begin to manure them till the full Moon of <hi>March</hi> be paſt, which is generally very dangerous both to them and to the <hi>Figg-trees,</hi> which laſt muſt not yet be quite uncover'd, it being enough to do it half way, at the ſame time we take off all their dead Wood and Branches, whether kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Froſt,</hi> or by any other means.</p>
                              <p>About the middle of <hi>March</hi> or before, if the weather be mild, we begin to ſow ſome <hi>Red</hi> or <hi>Golden Purſlain</hi> upon <hi>hot beds</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> and continue ſtill to ſow of the <hi>Green</hi> ſort.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48210:203"/>
We replant in their ſixt places common <hi>Cabbages</hi> and <hi>Milan Cabbages,</hi> which we ſhould take care to have ready in our <hi>Nurſery,</hi> from the beginning of <hi>November</hi> laſt paſt, in ſome well ſheltered place, but we replant none of thoſe that begin to mount, that is, to run up their ſtalks, as if they were going to Seed.</p>
                              <p>We ſow upon ſome end of a <hi>cold bed</hi> in plain Earth, ſome <hi>Aſparagus</hi> Seed for a <hi>Nurſery,</hi> to furniſh us with a Proviſion of it, which is ſown like other Seed.</p>
                              <p>We plant the <hi>Aſparagus Squares</hi> we have occaſion for, to which purpoſe we make choice of a fine Plantation of one years growth, or elſe of one of two.</p>
                              <p>The way to plant <hi>Aſparagus</hi> is, to place two or three Plants of them together, and neatly to ſpread out their Roots without cutting them but very little, unleſs we pleaſe, and then to cover them with a layer of Earth of two or three Inches thick, to plant theſe Tufts Checquer-wiſe, at a foot and a half's diſtance one from the other.</p>
                              <p>This <hi>Cold Bed</hi> ſhould generally be full four Foot broad, that there may be room enough for three ranks of them. But if we deſign to force any of them by heat in <hi>Winter,</hi> we muſt make the <hi>Cold Beds</hi> but three Foot broad, and we muſt obſerve, if the Ground be dry, to lay the Bed hollow within the Earth, with a good Spade, and by that means raiſe the Paths Arch-wiſe, making uſe of the Soil that comes out of it to cover again by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, and year by year, the Plantation as it grows ſtronger, and riſes out of the Ground. But if it be in a moiſt Ground, and very cool, it is better not to make the Bed ſo low nor hollow, but on the contrary to keep it a little higher than the paths, that the Winter waters may deſcend out of it into them, and may not rot the Plants, to which nothing is more dangerous than too much wet.</p>

                                 <hi>Aſparagus</hi> both old and young muſt be carefully howed, or cleared of Weeds, and in this Month of <hi>March,</hi> before they begin to appear above Ground, we muſt afford them a little manuring, by turning up the Earth to the depth of half a foot about them, to give the young <hi>Aſparagus</hi> the more Liberty to ſhoot up.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Radiſhes</hi> that are ſown on hot Beds with a caſt of the Hand, are generally not ſo fair nor ſo good as thoſe ſowed in holes, and are more apt to grow hollow and ſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy than they.</p>
                              <p>We ſtill continue to make ſome <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> that we may be ſtill ſupplied with them, till the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> when thoſe ſown in plain Ground come in. All the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Months in the Year will produce us enough of them, if we will take the pains to ſow ſome from time to time, and be careful liberally to water them.</p>
                              <p>At the beginning of the Month it will be time to replant what we have a mind ſhould run to Seed, <hi>viz. Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>white</hi> ſort, <hi>Cloves</hi> of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cloves</hi> and Seeds of <hi>Shalots,</hi> white <hi>Cabbage, Pancaliers Cabbage,</hi> &amp;c. Now likewiſe we are to tie up ſuch <hi>Lettuces</hi> as ſhould <hi>Cabbage,</hi> and yet do not, which tying makes them in a manner <hi>Cabbage</hi> by force.</p>
                              <p>We ſow the Seed of <hi>Pannacht</hi> or ſtriped <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> before the full Moon, to replant them in <hi>May;</hi> we alſo ſow the <hi>Annual Flowers</hi> upon <hi>hot Beds,</hi> to replant at the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> viz. <hi>Paſſe velours,</hi> or <hi>Velvet Flowers,</hi> called alſo <hi>Flower gentles,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maranthus, Indian Ocellus</hi> or <hi>French Marygolds, Indian Roſes,</hi> the <hi>Belles de Nuit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We make an end of Planting Trees both in their fixed places, and in Baskets.</p>
                              <p>We beſtow the firſt manuring upon all ſorts of <hi>Gardens,</hi> as well to render them agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſight, during the <hi>Eaſter Holy-Days,</hi> as to diſpoſe the Ground for all ſorts of Plants and Seeds.</p>
                              <p>We ſet in the Ground, <hi>Almonds</hi> that have ſprouted breaking off the ſprout before we plant them.</p>
                              <p>We ſow in the <hi>Flower Plots,</hi> or <hi>Parterres,</hi> ſome Seeds of <hi>Poppy,</hi> and of <hi>Larks Heels,</hi> which will flower after them that were ſown in <hi>September.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We plant <hi>Oculus Chriſti.</hi>

                              <p>Towards the twentieth day of this Month, we ſow ſome <hi>Capucin Capers,</hi> or <hi>Naſturces,</hi> to Replant them again a Month after in ſome good <hi>Expoſition,</hi> or at the foot of ſome Tree.</p>

                              <p>THere is no Month in the year wherein there is more work to be done in <hi>Gardens</hi> than in this, for now the Earth begins to be very fit, not only to be manured, but to receive whatſoever we have a mind to plant or ſow in it, as <hi>Lettuce, Leeks, Cabbage,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48210:204"/>
Borage, Bugloſs. Artichokes, Tarragon, Mint, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. Before the Month of <hi>April,</hi> it is as yet too cold, and after <hi>April,</hi> it begins to be too dry.</p>
                              <p>We furniſh thoſe places where any new planted Trees give but little marks of their proſpering, whether it be by <hi>Gum,</hi> in ſtone Fruit, or by pitiful ſmall ſhoots in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> But for this important Reparation, we muſt have brought up ready to our hands, ſome Trees in <hi>Baskets,</hi> which an underſtanding curious Perſon will never fail to have made proviſion of, who will have the pleaſure to plant ſome of them near thoſe that thrive not ſo well as they ſhould do, when he is not well aſſured they will abſolutely die; for when we are ſure of that, we pluck them up quite, to make room for them we ſhould ſubſtitute in their place, for which purpoſe, we make choice of cloſe and rainy weather.</p>
                              <p>We perform now our ſecond pruning of the Branches of <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> I mean only the Fruit Branches, in order to cut them off ſhort to that part juſt above where there is Fruit Knit; and if any of thoſe <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> have produced any very thick ſhoots upon high Branches, as ſometimes it happens after the full Moon of <hi>March,</hi> we pinch them to make them multiply into Fruit Branches, and to keep them low, when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they may not run up too high before their time.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Peas</hi> ſown in a good <hi>Expoſition,</hi> at the very middle of <hi>October,</hi> ſhould begin towards the middle of <hi>April,</hi> to put forth at leaſt their firſt Bloſſoms, and conſequently muſt be pinch'd; the Bloſſom ſprings out commonly in <hi>Peas,</hi> from the middle of the fifth or ſixth Leaf, from which ſame place, there ſprings an Arm or Branch that grows exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, and produces at each Leaf, a couple of Bloſſoms like the firſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more to fortify the firſt, we cut off that new Arm or ſhoot, juſt above the ſecond flower.</p>
                              <p>We continue to trim <hi>Musk Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> to new heat our <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and make new ones, and to ſow <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> that we may have ſome to replant that may ripen about the end of <hi>Summer,</hi> and beginning of <hi>Autumn.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We make ſome hot <hi>Muſhroom Beds</hi> in new Ground, the manner of doing which, I have already deſcribed elſewhere.</p>
                              <p>'Tis the <hi>Moon</hi> of this Month, that we vulgarly call the <hi>Ruddy Moon,</hi> it being very ſubject to be windy, cold and dry, and to be fatal thereby to many new planted Trees, unleſs great care be taken to water them about the Foot, once a Week; For which purpoſe we make a round hollow circle or ſmall Trench, round about their foot juſt over the part where the Extremities of their roots are, and then pour into the ſaid Trench or Circle, a pitcher full of water if the Tree be little, or two or three, if it be bigger, and when the water is ſoak'd in, we fill up the Circle again, if we think good, with Earth, or elſe we cover it with ſome dry Dung, or Weeds newly pluck'd up, that we may the better repeat our watering once a Week during the extream dry Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                              <p>We weed up all the ill weeds that grow among good Seed, we take the ſame courſe with <hi>Straw-berries, Peas,</hi> and replanted <hi>Lettuce,</hi> and we howe all about them, the better to looſen the Earth, and open a paſſage for the firſt rain that ſhall fall.</p>
                              <p>About the middle of <hi>April,</hi> we begin to ſow a little <hi>White Endive,</hi> in plain Ground, to whiten it in the ſame place; and provided it be thin ſown, no Seed comes ſo eaſily up as this ſort of <hi>Endive.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>At the middle of <hi>April</hi> we alſo ſow in their places, the firſt Spaniſh <hi>Cardons,</hi> and the ſecond at the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> the firſt are commonly a Month in coming up, and the others about 15 days.</p>
                              <p>We alſo ſtill ſow in this Month, ſome <hi>Sorrel,</hi> if we be not ſufficiently provided with it before; and we ſow it either in <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> in little furrows, which is handſomeſt, or elſe ſcatteringly on the plain Ground, which is moſt common; or elſe upon the ſides of Squares, to ſerve for an edging: we likewiſe replant in rows or furrows, that which we remove from other places, and is but about a year old, and eſpecially of that of the large ſort, whether our neceſſities have obliged us to break up ſome <hi>Bed</hi> of it, and that we be not minded to loſe it, or whether we do it deſignedly.</p>
                              <p>We uſe the ſame method with <hi>Fennel</hi> and <hi>Anis,</hi> and if the high winds, and <hi>Cold</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us not, we begin to give a little Air to our <hi>Musk Melons</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> and continue to give them a little more and more of it by degrees, till the end of <hi>May,</hi> when if we be in a good <hi>Climate,</hi> we take off the <hi>Bells</hi> quite. And we lift up each <hi>Bell</hi> with three little forks, otherwiſe the plant hurt by its ſides, would dwindle and grow lank. And if after we have given it a little Air, the <hi>Cold</hi> continues ſtill ſharp enough to ſpoil the branches and Leaves of it that are ſprouting, we take care to cover them with a little dry Litter.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="157" facs="tcp:48210:204"/>
At the end of the Month, we replant the <hi>Radiſhes</hi> we have removed from the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> where we firſt raiſed them, to make a good proviſion of Seed, chooſing for that purpoſe, thoſe that have the <hi>Reddest</hi> roots and the feweſt leaves, and we need only make holes at a foot diſtance one from the other, in one or more <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> with a planting ſtick, and thruſt in the <hi>Radiſhes</hi> into thoſe holes, and then preſs down the Earth about them, and afterwards water them, if the rain do's not ſpare us that labour.</p>
                              <p>We chooſe apart of the faireſt of the <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> as well the <hi>Winter</hi> ones, which are the <hi>Shell,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem Lettuces,</hi> as the <hi>Curles Bright Lettuce</hi> raiſed upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> and under <hi>Bells,</hi> to plant them all together in ſome <hi>Cold Beds</hi> at a foot diſtance one from another, to let them run to Seed; which we alſo perform with a planting ſtick.</p>
                              <p>We plant edgings of <hi>Time, Sage, Marjoram, Hyſſop, Lavender, Rue, Worm-wood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Spring Lettuce,</hi> to <hi>Cabbage,</hi> which ſucceed one another in this order; the <hi>Curled Bright Lettuce</hi> is the firſt and beſt, as being the moſt tender and delicate, but it requires a mild and light Soil, or above all, a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> to plant it on, under <hi>Bells,</hi> from the Month of <hi>February,</hi> and during all the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> A groſs Soil agrees not with it, for inſtead of growing bigger there, it dwindles to nothing.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Green Curled Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>George Lettuce,</hi> the <hi>Little Red Lettuce,</hi> and thoſe called the <hi>Royal,</hi> the <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and the <hi>Perpignan,</hi> follow next after. The <hi>Royal Lettuce</hi> is a very fair and thick <hi>Lettuce,</hi> which differs only from the <hi>Bellegarde</hi> in that it is a little leſs <hi>Curled.</hi> The <hi>Capucin, Short, Aubervilliers,</hi> and <hi>Auſtrian Lettuces</hi> ſucceed them, and run not ſo eaſily to Seed, as the preceeding ones. The <hi>Alfanges, Chicons,</hi> and <hi>Imperials</hi> which are all <hi>Lettuces</hi> to tie up, bring up the Rear; and the <hi>Genua Lettuces,</hi> both the <hi>Red, Bright,</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> are the laſt <hi>Summer Lettuces;</hi> we muſt replant a good number of them at the very beginning of <hi>May,</hi> to have them good about <hi>Mid-ſummer,</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>Summer;</hi> of all <hi>Lettuces,</hi> this ſort beſt endures the great heats, and is leaſt diſpoſed to run to Seed; for which reaſon to obtain Seed of it, we muſt have ſown it upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> from the very Month of <hi>February,</hi> that we may have ſome good plants of it to ſet again at the latter end of <hi>April.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Royal Lettuce</hi> begins again to be fit to be replanted about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> to ſupply us, together with that of <hi>Genua,</hi> all the reſt of Autumn. From the end of <hi>August,</hi> we begin to ſow the <hi>Shell,</hi> or <hi>Winter Lettuce,</hi> that we may have ſome fit to re-plant in the Months of <hi>October,</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> for our <hi>Winter</hi> proviſion.</p>
                              <p>It is hard to make any Deſcriptions of theſe ſorts of <hi>Lettuces,</hi> exact enough to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them by, the difference between them conſiſting chiefly in having Leaves a little more or leſs green, or <hi>Curled;</hi> It is enough for the curious to know their names, to be enabled to ask for them of their Friends, or buy them of the Herb Merchants, we learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually to know them in the uſing. The two <hi>Criſped</hi> or <hi>Curled Sorts</hi> are ſo called, from the <hi>Curling</hi> of their Leaves, and the <hi>Red</hi> ones from their Colour. The <hi>Shell Lettuce</hi> has a very round Leaf which is very apt to ſhut up like a <hi>Shell.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>There is an infinite Diverſity of kinds of <hi>Lettuces,</hi> the worſt is that which we call <hi>Cats Tongue,</hi> which is very ſharp pointed, and never <hi>Cabbages.</hi> The <hi>Aubervilliers Lettuce</hi> grows ſo very hard that it is ſcarce fit for <hi>Sallets,</hi> but is better for pottage; but yet it is very ſubject to be bitter.</p>
                              <p>We muſt not fail every fifteen days, to ſow a little <hi>Genua Lettuce,</hi> that we may always be provided with ſome fit to replant during all the whole <hi>Summer,</hi> till the middle of <hi>September;</hi> we muſt be careful and eſpecially in rainy weather, to deſtroy both the Black and <hi>Shell Snails</hi> that come out of the Walls where they breed Young ones, becauſe they do a great deal of miſchief by gnawing the young Shoots of Trees, and new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lettuces</hi> and <hi>Cabbages.</hi> If the <hi>Ruddy</hi> or <hi>Dry Winds</hi> Reign, as they generally do this Month, we muſt carefully and plentifully water every thing in our <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> except it be the <hi>Aſparagus.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We continue to Trim <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and plant new ones upon new <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> at the beginning of this Month, and we alſo ſow ſome in the naked Ground, in little Dikes filled with mold, or compoſt, like to thoſe I have already mentioned for <hi>Cardons.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We now likewiſe ſearch the Woods for Young <hi>Straw-berry Plants,</hi> to make <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of, in ſome part of our <hi>Garden,</hi> we plant tufts of two or three plants of them together at four or five Inches diſtance one from another, and if the Soil be dry, in a hollow <hi>Bed</hi> of two or three Inches deep, the better to retain and preſerve the rain water, and that of our waterings, or elſe upon ſome <hi>Bed</hi> near ſome <hi>Northern</hi> Walls.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48210:205"/>
We alſo now diſ-eye or ſeparate the Off-Sets or Slips of our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> as ſoon as they are big enough, and we plant as many of them as we need, two or three of them in each hole, or Trench of about three or four Inches deep, and two full Foot and a half diſtance one from the other, each <hi>Bed</hi> ſhould be four foot wide, and contain two rows of <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants along its ſides, and there muſt be a void ſpace left in the middle, of three foot wide for the planting of <hi>Leek Chaids,</hi> or great whited <hi>Leeks,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Collyflowers,</hi> in imitation of the Market-Gard'ners, who are good Husbands of their Ground. The two <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants which we ſet in each hole, muſt be placed a full foot and half diſtance one from the other.</p>
                              <p>We ſtill continue planting <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> and filling the places where there are any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if we can timely diſcover them, and we take care to water the new Plants.</p>
                              <p>We likewiſe ſtill bind up thoſe <hi>Lettuces</hi> that Cabbage not as they ſhould.</p>
                              <p>We keep open the Windows of the green Houſes, where our <hi>Orange Trees</hi> are in fair weather, to reaccuſtom them by little and little, to the wide Air; towards the end of the Month, we bring out our <hi>Jaſmin</hi> and trim it; we alſo begin to prune our Vines at the firſt coming in of the Month, if we have neglected to do it about the middle of <hi>March</hi> laſt; and we prune the <hi>Wall Vines</hi> ſooner than thoſe in the open Fields.</p>
                              <p>We have already in the month of <hi>March,</hi> ſet into the Earth, thoſe <hi>Almonds</hi> which ſprouted early, and in this Month we ſet thoſe which having not ſprouted at the ſame time with the others, had been put up back again into Mold, Earth, or Sand.</p>
                              <p>In the beginning of this Month, Gardens ſhould be almoſt in their Perfection, as well for their general neatneſs, and pleaſing Proſpect, as being all over covered either with the green Seedlings of all ſorts which have been ſown, or with Plants which have been ſet, excepting <hi>Endive, Succory, Celery, Collyflowers,</hi> &amp;c. which are not replanted till about the middle of <hi>May.</hi> In fine, if we have neglected any thing that ſhould have been done in <hi>March,</hi> we muſt be ſure to do it at the very beginning of this Month, and particularly, we muſt ſow <hi>Parſly, wild Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Harico's</hi> or <hi>French-Beans,</hi> the ſecond being to be ſown about the middle, and the third at the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> that ſo we may have a crop of them about two Months after ſowing.</p>
                              <p>About this time, the <hi>Strawberries</hi> growing in the naked Earth, ſhoot forth their ſtems, when we muſt take exact care to pluck all the <hi>Cuckows</hi> among them, that is, thoſe <hi>Straw-berry</hi> plants that bloſſom much without knitting; nay, I would have the <hi>Caprons</hi> pluckt up too, unleſs any Perſon have a particular fancy for them, they are eaſie to be known by their thick ſhort and Velvet ſtems, their large Flowers, and their very long Velvet, and ſharp pointed Leaves; but the <hi>Cuckows</hi> are ſomewhat hard to be diſtinguiſht, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly till their ſtems be formed. The moſt part of them are <hi>Strawberry</hi> Plants that have degenerated, and yet ſo, that the Leaves of the good ones and the bad ones are pretty like one another; but thoſe degenerate Plants in proceſs of time by their runners, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an infinite number of others, which to appearance are very fair, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very apt to deceive us, yet thoſe that are acquainted with them, obſerve that they are a little more Velveted, and ſomewhat greener than the good ones. And in Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I muſt tell you, that if extraordinary care be not taken to extirpate thoſe unlucky Plants that impoſe upon us thus by their Beauty, we ſhall in little time find our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelves ſtockt with none but ſuch, to which the Proverb particularly agrees, which ſaith, <hi>a fair ſhow, but little Fruit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We ſow our laſt <hi>Cucumbers</hi> about the tenth or twelfth of this Month, to have ſome lateward ones, and ſuch as may be fit to pickle in <hi>October,</hi> which laſt are commonly called <hi>Cornichons,</hi> or horned <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and in <hi>Engliſh, Crumplings,</hi> and <hi>Guerkins.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Strawberry</hi> ſtems muſt be much pinched, and ſome of them muſt be quite plucked up too when they ſhoot up in too great Numbers from feeble Plants; by pinching, here is meant the taking off the laſt Flowers and laſt Buds of every ſtem, leaving but three or four of thoſe that firſt appeared upon thoſe ſtems, and which are neareſt to the Ground.</p>
                              <p>It is particularly about the end of this Month, that <hi>May</hi> Moon begins, that is ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and ſo vigorous in its Productions, when we muſt with all poſſible care run over our <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> and draw from behind the Trails, thoſe Branches that grow between them and the Wall, as well the ſmaller ones, as more particularly thoſe that are thick: at the ſame time <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> and other <hi>Stone-Fruit-Trees</hi> are to be pruned the third time, it having been done the ſecond time whilſt they were in Bloſſom, to take away all thoſe Branches that had not bloſſom'd. And at this time we reckon, that all thoſe Bloſſoms that will knit at all, are already knit, and accordingly we are not to count any of them for true <hi>Peaches,</hi> but thoſe only that are well knit, and of a pretty bigneſs too, becauſe

till then, many of them continue to fall, though they ſeemed well knit. And therefore it is convenient to ſhorten all thoſe Branches which having been left long purpoſely for Fruit, have not anſwered that end, but have either retained no Fruit at all, or a very ſmall quantity, and which perhaps ſprout but weakly, that is, produce but very little ſhoots, or perhaps nothing but Leaves, the feebleſt of thoſe Branches muſt be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of all their ſhoots, to one or two at moſt, and in general, all thoſe Branches muſt be ſhortned, that appear not vigorouſly, or that are blaſted by the <hi>Ruddy Winds.</hi> And Laſtly, we muſt leave only ſuch a burden of Branches and Fruit on the Tree as ſhall be proportionable to its greater or leſſer Vigour, and accordingly we muſt leave a great deal upon vigorous Trees, eſpecially if they be ſprung from Stones, and but a little on them that are weak, and always aim as near as may be, to form that which we call a goodly Tree, taking all poſſible care that each Fruit-Branch may have its Fruit at its Extremity. This third pruning ſhould be done either before we new nail up our Wall-Trees, or at leaſt whilſt we are nailing them.</p>
                              <p>At this time likewiſe, we are to pinch, that is to ſay, break off, to four or five Eyes or Buds, thoſe thick ſhoots in Peach-Trees that are ſprung out ſince the main Pruning of that year, in order to make them ſhoot out three or four midling ſhoots, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be for a Wood Branch, and the reſt for Fruit; this Operation is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med particularly upon thoſe very thick ſhoots that ſpring out of the Extremity of a Tree that is grown high, when it has already attained its due height. It is likewiſe ſometimes, though rarely performed upon the lower ſhoots, when we have occaſion to fill up any void places that are made near any very thick Branches, whether young or old, which we have cut ſhort the laſt Winters Pruning; thoſe thick Branches are but too ſubject ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to ſprout at all, or to grow full of Gum, both they and the young Shoots they produce in the <hi>Spring</hi> time.</p>
                              <p>It is not convenient to pinch any of all the other Fruit-Trees, excepting <hi>Graffs,</hi> when having been graffed upon thick ſtocks, they have begun to ſhoot out with too much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, becauſe the ſhoots of ſuch graffs would grow too high, and too bare, if they were not checkt by this Operation, and made to produce many Branches that prove good, inſtead of one that otherwiſe might have remained uſeleſs, unleſs it be in ſuch occaſions we may pinch as long as we pleaſe, we ſhall never gain any advantage by it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pinching extends likewiſe to <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> but that is not to be done till the end of <hi>May,</hi> as I ſhall further ſhew afterwards.</p>

                              <p>THe Effects of <hi>Vegetation</hi> during the Month of <hi>March,</hi> ſeemed to be but little proofs of Trial which Nature then made in order to ſome greater performances. For alaſs, Trees bloſſoming or ſhooting forth Leaves, or beginning to put forth ſwelling Buds. &amp;c. are all marks of leſſer vigour than weakneſs, after which, in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>April,</hi> we have ſeen the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> augment in ſtrength, and ſhew its effects by the knitting of Fruit, lengthning out Branches, and the coming up of ſown Seeds, &amp;c. But at length when we once come to the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 'tis then that <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſeems in earneſt to diſplay and exert all the force ſhe is Miſtreſs of, in order to the maintaining her ſelf in that flouriſhing Eſtate during the whole Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> following, at this time covering the Walls with new Branches, plumping the Fruit, and covering the Earth with a lovely and charming verdure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ners have great need to be upon their Guards, to prevent their Gardens falling into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, becauſe 'tis moſt ſure, that if they be not now extreamly careful and laborious, there is no Diſaſter, but they may expect; pernicious Weeds will in little time choke up all their good Seeds, their Walks and Alleys will be overgrown, and their Trees will fall into the greateſt Confuſion, for which reaſons it will highly concern them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly watchful and diligent to weed, manure, cleanſe, to take off all ſuperfluous Leaves and Sprigs, and to nail up <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> by which means it will be in their Power to acquire the deſirable Commendation of having adorned and ſet out their Gardens with all the luſtre and excellency which they ought to have.</p>

In the mean while, about the ſeventh or eighth day of the Month, we ſhould plant our <hi>Collyflowers, Milan Cabbages, Capucin Capers,</hi> or <hi>Naſturces, Beet-Chards,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48210:206"/>
If we plant them ſooner, they commonly run to Seed, which is to be avoided; and in fine for thoſe things, we ought not to paſs the fifteenth day, nor likewiſe for the ſowing of <hi>Winter Cabbages.</hi> We now make all the haſt we can, to make an end of diſ-eying or ſlipping our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> which are vigorous, and ſeem to have need of being diſcharged and thinned, and we make an end of planting new ones. The Eyes or Sucker-ſlips are good enough, provided they be pretty thick and white, though they have no root at their heel or foot, and we may be ſure to have very fine Fruit from them in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and in truth it were to be wiſhed, they would yield none ſooner, becauſe thoſe produced before that time are commonly pitiful, ſtarveling, and as 'twere abortive Fruits. Yet 'tis not enough to plant only ſome good thick young ſlip-ſuckers, but we muſt likewiſe plant ſome midling ones, eſpecially in ſome well ſheltred place, only to fortifie themſelves there during the reſt of the year, that they may be able to yield us their firſt <hi>Artichokes</hi> next <hi>Spring;</hi> thoſe which have born in <hi>Autumn,</hi> not making ſuch ſwift advances as theſe other. Next we are to plant our <hi>Beet Chards</hi> almoſt at the ſame time, which are well placed, if planted in the middle of the <hi>Artichokes,</hi> that is, one <hi>Beet</hi> plant between two <hi>Artichokes,</hi> ſo that there may be ſome in one Rank, and none in the other, for there muſt be room enough left free, to go upon to water, weed, manure, gather, and to cover them too, when need ſhall require.</p>
                              <p>The Earlieſt <hi>Musk Melons</hi> begin to knit in the firſt quarter, or at the full of this Months <hi>Moon,</hi> but chiefly at the wane of it, if their <hi>Beds</hi> were very hot at the full, and are grown cooler at the wane.</p>
                              <p>We alſo at the ſame time Rank our <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> in the place alloted for the <hi>Fig Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that we may have them in the diſpoſition we deſire. They begin then to put forth their Leaves and ſhoots, and at length their Fruit begins to plump at the full <hi>Moon.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, we begin with diligence and expedition, to nail up the new ſhoots of <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> if they be ſtrong enough to ſuffer it: And it is convenient to have finiſh'd this Work at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> becauſe at the end of that Month, we muſt begin the ſecond nailing of the firſt ſhoots, and the firſt of thoſe which were never yet nail'd. We muſt likewiſe pinch, or break off the thick ſhoots we find, whether becauſe after the firſt pinching of <hi>April,</hi> they have not multiplied into Branches as far as they extend, and on the contrary, have produced yet but one thick ſhoot, or becauſe, though they have multiplied into Branches, they have produced one ſhoot thick enough to be pinched; for otherwiſe that thick ſhoot would be unuſeful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious; unuſeful, becauſe it muſt be taken away, or at leaſt be cut very ſhort, and pernicious, becauſe it will, as one may ſay, have robb'd other neceſſary ſhoots of that nouriſhment they ſhould have had: Always taking it for a Rule, that we muſt in nailing, take care to couch all thoſe Branches which may and ought to be couched, without tying ſeveral of them together, or taking away, or plucking off any that is ſightly, unleſs it be that we can by no means couch it, in which caſe, we muſt cut it off within the breadth of a Crown piece of the place from whence it ſprouts, in hopes that out of the two ſides of the remaining ſtump of that thickneſs, there may ſprout ſome good Fruit-Branches, we muſt alſo have a care not to lay one croſs another, unleſs we be neceſſarily obliged ſo to do, to fill up a void place, or to preſerve a uniform equality.</p>
                              <p>If there be any Trees deſigned to mount upright, we muſt accordingly order for that purpoſe, the Branch that ſeems moſt proper for it.</p>
                              <p>We tie the graffs either to their Trunk, or to ſticks ſet up on purpoſe by them, to make them grow in that figure we would have them, and hinder them from being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Winds.</p>
                              <p>We ſow a great deal of <hi>Genua Lettuce,</hi> and we replant ſome of them, and of the other <hi>Lettuces</hi> alſo.</p>
                              <p>We likewiſe trim <hi>Pear-Trees,</hi> either to take off the falſe ſhoots if any appear, which is done by plucking them quite away when they make a confuſion, or even ſuch others which though they be good, yet becauſe they might produce that confuſion which is ſo much to be avoided in a Tree, muſt therefore be taken off, for the better fortifying of thoſe that are to make the figure of that Tree; for a ſecond ſhoot will grow much more vigorous, if we take away that which being at the extremity of the pruned Branch was counted for the firſt.</p>
                              <p>We ſow <hi>Endive,</hi> that we may have ſome good, at the end of <hi>July,</hi> which may be white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſame place where it firſt grew, without removing, if it being ſown thin, and well watered during the whole Month. We now alſo take the advantage of ſome rainy
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48210:206"/>
weather, to replant in their deſigned places, our annual Flowers, ſome of them ſeldom failing to come to good there; we likewiſe take the advantage of the ſame time, to fill up with <hi>Basketed,</hi> or <hi>Circumpoſed</hi> Trees, the places of thoſe that are dead, or that thwart our expectations, or that give us no very good hopes of their thriving. The manner of doing it, is, to make a hole big enough to hold the Basket and Tree, then to put it in, and carefully to fill up with Earth all the hollow ſpace round about the Basket, and to preſs it down hard either with the foot or hand, and then to pour down all round upon it, two or three pitchers full of water, in order to the better incorporating the Earth without, with that within, ſo that there may not be left the leaſt hollow in the world. It is neceſſary to renew theſe waterings two or three times during the reſt of the <hi>Summer.</hi>

                              <p>We alſo ſtill plant <hi>Beet Chards,</hi> chooſing for that purpoſe the brighteſt of thoſe that are of the growth of the laſt ſown Seeds, as being both fairer and better than thoſe which are green.</p>
                              <p>We continue our <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants till the end of this Month, at which time, we may perfectly diſtinguiſh the good ones by their Stems, or upright ſhoots.</p>
                              <p>We alſo ſtill continue to tie up thoſe <hi>Lettuces</hi> that <hi>Cabbage</hi> not as they ſhould.</p>
                              <p>We ſow no more <hi>Lettuces,</hi> except <hi>Genuz Lettuces,</hi> after the middle of <hi>May,</hi> becauſe all the reſt but only this laſt ſort, are too apt to run to Seed.</p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Musk Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers</hi> in the naked Earth in little Holes or Trenches filled with mold; we alſo plant <hi>Pumpions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                 </hi> or <hi>Citruls</hi> in the like holes, at the diſtance of three <hi>Toiſes</hi> or <hi>Fathoms,</hi> they are ſuch as have been raiſed on <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and therefore to make them take root again, the ſooner, we cover them with ſomething for five or ſix days, unleſs it rain, the great heat of the Sun, otherwiſe being apt to make them wither, and ſometimes to kill them quite.</p>
                              <p>We continue to ſow a few <hi>Peas,</hi> which muſt be of the biggeſt ſort; and if we think good, we pull off ſome of the Branches of the others that are over vigorous, after they are well cleared of Weeds; <hi>Peas</hi> that are disbranched, bearing a more plentiful crop than others.</p>
                              <p>We bring out our <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> at the firſt quarter of this Months <hi>Moon,</hi> if the weather begin to be ſecure from the aſſaults of the <hi>Froſt,</hi> and we put them into boxes that have need of it; I referr you for their culture to the Treatiſe I have compoſed expreſly about that ſubject: It was our care during all the fair days in <hi>April,</hi> to leave open the windows of their <hi>Conſervatories,</hi> to accuſtom them by degrees, to the open Air.</p>
                              <p>We trim our <hi>Jaſmins</hi> when we bring them out, cutting off all their Branches to the length of half an Inch.</p>
                              <p>At the end of this Month, we begin to clip for the firſt time, our paliſades, or pole hedges of <hi>Box, Filaria's, Yew</hi> and <hi>Eſpicia's.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Above all things, care muſt be taken to water all our plants largely, or elſe they will all roaſt and ſcorch, whereas by the help of ſeaſonable waterings, we may viſibly perceive them thrive. We alſo now water new planted Trees, and for that purpoſe, we make a hollow Circle of four or five Inches deep, round about the extreamities of the roots, and pour into it ſome pitchers of water, and when 'tis ſoak'd in, we either throw back the Earth into the Circle, or elſe we cover it with dry Dung, or little, in order to renew our waterings ſeveral other times, till the Trees have taken faſt root again, after which, we fill it up with Earth again.</p>
                              <p>We may begin to replant our <hi>Purſlain</hi> for Seeding towards the end of the Month.</p>
                              <p>We continue to trim <hi>Musk Melons,</hi> but we replant no more of them after the middle of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But we ſtill continue to plant <hi>Cucumbers.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>About the end of the Month; we begin to plant <hi>Cellery,</hi> and we uſe two ways of planting it, <hi>viz.</hi> either in <hi>Cold Beds</hi> hollowed into the Ground, as we do <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting three ranks of them in every <hi>Bed,</hi> and placing both the ranks, and the <hi>Cellery</hi> plants at about a foot diſtance one from another, and that is the beſt way for them when they are a little bigger than ordinary, that ſo we may be able to raiſe the earth about them afterwards, with that which was taken out of the furrows, and which was thrown upon the next <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> or elſe we replant them on plain Ground at the ſame diſtance as before, and at the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> binding them firſt with two or three bands; theſe are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in tufts, that we may replant them as nigh as we can, to one another, that ſo they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48210:207"/>
may be the more eaſily covered with long dry Dung, and be the better whitened, and defended from the <hi>Froſt.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Towards the end of the Month, we begin to tie our <hi>Vines</hi> to their props, and to nail up ſuch ſtocks of them as are planted by <hi>Walls,</hi> after we have firſt clear'd them of all their feeble, unprofitable, and unfruitful Shoots and Sprigs.</p>
                              <p>We likewiſe plant ſingle <hi>Anemonies,</hi> which flower a Month after, and we may have planted ſome every Month ſince the laſt preceeding <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they blowing and flowering in the ſame manner, if not hindered by an extream cold Seaſon.</p>
                              <p>At the very beginning of the Month, or at leaſt as ſoon as ever we can, we pick off, and thin our <hi>Apricocks</hi> when there are too many of them, never leaving two cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that ſo thoſe we leave on, may grow the bigger, and at the end of the ſame Month, we may pick off, and thin our <hi>Teaches</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> if they be big enough, and there be two many of them. About that time alſo, or at the beginning of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Month, the firſt bright <hi>Cabbages</hi> are to be ſown for <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> the biggeſt of them which are replanted in <hi>July,</hi> being to be eaten in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and the leſs vigorous which are replanted in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> being to ſerve for our Winter Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                              <p>During all the Month of <hi>May,</hi> the ſhoots of <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> are apt enough to ſlide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves behind their trails or props as I have ſaid in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> and we ſhall hardly be able to draw them out again without breaking them, unleſs we do it in time, and be careful once every Week, to take an exact view all along our Walls, to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo miſchievous an inconvenience, againſt which too much caution cannot be uſed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branches grow crooked, rugged, parched, and hooked at the ends, and their Leaves alſo; and therefore about the full Moon, we muſt pull off thoſe Leaves ſo crumpled and hooked, and break off as low as we can, the parched ſhoots, that there may ſpring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inſtead of them that may be better and ſtreighter. <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> too muſt now be pruned, and eſpecially thoſe in Boxes, of the method of doing which, I have compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a particular Treatiſe.</p>
                              <p>We continue to ſow a few <hi>Radiſhes</hi> among other Seeds, as we ſhould have alſo done in the two laſt preceeding Months.</p>
                              <p>We alſo now take the advantage of ſome gentle Showers, or of very cloudy weather, to uncover what we have ſheltred under <hi>Glaſs Bells</hi> or <hi>Frames,</hi> as well for the watering of our <hi>Beds,</hi> as for the inuring and hardening them to indure the open Air.</p>
                              <p>If our Garden be ſituated in a Sandy and dry Ground, we endeavour by the help of ſome little Dykes or Gutters, to carry off all the water that falls ſometimes in haſtly Storms, to thoſe places that are manured, that none of it may be unprofitably waſted in the Walks or Allies, and if they be ſituated in Ground that is too ſtrong, fat and moiſt, ſuch as that of our new Kitchen-Garden at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> we drain it away from thoſe Grounds that are incommoded by it, by conveying it into the Walls or Allies, to ſpend it ſelf there, or ſhooting it off into Stone gutters that carry it out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; for which purpoſe we muſt raiſe our Ground into arch'd ridges.</p>
                              <p>During all this Month, it is good to lay yellow ſtock <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> by planting cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of them, where ever we have a mind, or by laying their Branches that ſtill grow to their Plants.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe that are curious in <hi>Carnations</hi> and <hi>Clove-Gilliflowers,</hi> in order to have double ones, ſow ſome good Seeds of them about the 5, 6, 7, or 8th. of <hi>May</hi> Moon, in earthen Pans, or wooden Tubs, that at leaſt they may begin to ſprout at the full Moon, which ſometimes happens in <hi>June,</hi> but moſt commonly in <hi>May,</hi> thoſe plants ought to grow big enough to be removed in <hi>September,</hi> into the naked Earth, that ſo they may have taken Ground before the <hi>Equinox;</hi> others again content themſelves with ſowing their Seeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Equinox.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We ſhould likewiſe replant before the end of <hi>May,</hi> ſome <hi>green curled,</hi> and <hi>Aubervilliers Lettuce,</hi> that we may have ſome all the Month of <hi>June,</hi> together with the <hi>Chicons,</hi> and <hi>Imperial Long-Lettuce.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We muſt alſo at this time endeavour to deſtroy the thick white Worms, which now ſpoil the <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage Lettuce,</hi> and take away the green <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> which quite cat up the Leaves of the <hi>Curran</hi> and <hi>Gooſeberry buſhes,</hi> and ſo ſpoil their Fruit.</p>
                              <p>At the end of <hi>May,</hi> we ſhould alſo thin thoſe Roots that grow too thick, and replant thoſe we have plucked up in another place, as <hi>Beet-raves,</hi> or <hi>Red Beet-Roots, Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                              <p>We may alſo plant ſome <hi>Artichokes,</hi> till the twelfth or fifteenth of the Month, which being well watered, will ſerve for the next <hi>Spring.</hi> Waterings are to no purpoſe, if they ſoak not to the Root, and therefore the deeper the Plant is rooted, the more plentifully muſt it be watered, and eſpecially in dry Ground, for in wet Grounds, they muſt be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered both leſs often, and leſs plentifully. For example, <hi>Artichokes</hi> growing in light Grounds, have need of a Pitcher full or two of Water, for each Plant, whereas in ſtronger Grounds, one pitcher full will ſerve three.</p>
                              <p>Towards the middle of <hi>June,</hi> we plant <hi>Leeks</hi> in Holes or Trenches ſix full Inches deep, at half a foot's diſtance one from the other, which is done with a planting ſtick, placing but one of them in each hole, without heeding to preſs down the Earth cloſe about the <hi>Leek,</hi> when we have done, as is practiſed to all other Plants that are ſet with a planting ſtick.</p>
                              <p>We continue to ſow <hi>Endive,</hi> and <hi>Genua Lettuce,</hi> that we may be furniſht with ſome to replant upon occaſion, all the reſt of the Summer, and we gather the <hi>Chervil</hi> that is the firſt that runs up to Seed from the <hi>Chervil,</hi> that was ſown the <hi>Autumn</hi> before, cutting off all the Seed ſtems, and when they are dried, threſhing out the Seed, and fanning it like Wheat.</p>
                              <p>The ſame method is practiſed with all Seeds that are gathered each in their proper Seaſons, and eſpecially in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> taking great care to prevent the Birds, who are very greedy of them, from devouring them.</p>
                              <p>We replant <hi>Beet Chards</hi> in order to have them good to eat in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and they are beſt placed in the void ſpace remaining between the <hi>Artichoke Ranks,</hi> they muſt be ſet at the diſtance of a Foot and a half one from the other.</p>
                              <p>We muſt take great care to extirpate all the Weeds which now grow up in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and that particularly before they run to Seed, to prevent their multiplying which they are apt to do but too much of themſelves without ſowing.</p>
                              <p>We muſt now alſo without further delay, clip all our Paliſade's, and edgings of Box, ſo that they may be all furniſht at furtheſt at <hi>Mid-Summer,</hi> and have time to ſhoot out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before <hi>Autumn;</hi> and we muſt liberally water all Seeds ſown in our <hi>Kitchen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We muſt water plentifully, and every day the <hi>Cucumbers</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and <hi>Musk-melons</hi> moderately two or three times a Week, allowing half a pitcher full of Water to each Plant.</p>
                              <p>From the very middle of <hi>June</hi> we begin to graff by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> our <hi>Stone-Fruit-Trees,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Cherries</hi> upon great Trees, upon Wood of two years growth, which are cut off three or four inches from the place where the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> is to be placed. The beſt time for this, is always before the <hi>Solſtice.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Groſs Soils muſt be often ſtirred and manured, that they may not have time to grow hard, and chap, commonly we beſtow an univerſal manuring or ſtirring up the Ground upon all our Gardens in this Seaſon, and the beſt time to ſtir dry Grounds in, is either a little before or after Rain, or even whilſt it rains, that the water may the more ſwiftly penetrate to the bottom, before the great heat comes to turn it into Vapors, and for ſtrong and moiſt Soils, we muſt wait for hot and dry weather, to dry and heat them, before we move them, carefull Gard'ners make Dykes to convey the gluts of Water that fall about this time in haſty Storms, a croſs their Squares, eſpecially if their Ground be light; but on the contrary, if it be too ſtrong, they drain the water out of the Squares, as I have ſaid already, when I was ſpeaking of the works of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Perſons curious in Carnations, and Clove-gilliflowers, ſhould have begun before this time to put Rings about each plant of them, to keep up their mounting ſtems, and hinder the Winds from breaking off their Buds or Buttons, the like they do to their <hi>Sedums,</hi> &amp;c. and if they have not yet done it, they do it in this Month, and not only take off
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48210:208"/>
from them the ſmall Buds that grow upon them in over great Numbers, to fortifie the principal ones, but likewiſe the greateſt part of the mounting ſtems, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only one of the faireſt, and moſt likely, to produce the moſt beautiful Flowers.</p>

                              </p>
                              <p>We bind up our <hi>Cellery</hi> with one or two bands below, and then we raiſe a Butt or Bank about it, either with very dry long Dung, or with very dry Earth, to whiten it; but we muſt have a care not to tie it up but in very dry weather. The ſame caution muſt be obſerved in all Plants that are to be tied, after which, we cut off the extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Leaves, to prevent the ſap from aſcending and ſpending it ſelf to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by which means it is kept down in the Buried Plant, and makes it grow thick.</p>
                              <p>We alſo now tie up the Leaves of ſome <hi>Collyflowers</hi> whoſe Fruit ſeems to begin to be formed.</p>
                              <p>We cover with compoſt, the <hi>Sorrel</hi> which has been cut.</p>
                              <p>We ſow <hi>Maches</hi> for <hi>Lent,</hi> and for <hi>Reponces,</hi> it is not worth the while to ſow them in a Garden becauſe there are enough of them in the <hi>Spring</hi> time, to be found in the <hi>Corn</hi> Fields, and by hedge ſides.</p>
                              <p>It is particularly in the Month, and during all <hi>Autumn,</hi> that Gard'ners moſt deſire rain.</p>
                              <p>We continue to deſtroy <hi>Flies</hi> and <hi>Waſps</hi> that eat the <hi>Figs, Muſcat Grapes,</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> and other Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Bottles,</hi> or <hi>Cucurbit Glaſſes</hi> of Honied Water.</p>
                              <p>We ſow <hi>Poppies</hi> and <hi>Larks Heels</hi> in Flower <hi>Gardens,</hi> to have them Flower in <hi>June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> before them that are ſown in <hi>March.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In this Month, and the precedent one, we replant <hi>Endive</hi> among <hi>Cabbage Lettuces,</hi> theſe latter having commonly performed their duty, before the <hi>Endive</hi> is come to its full growth. Waterings muſt be continued as long as the weather is Hot and dry.</p>
                              <p>Good <hi>Winter Endive,</hi> if our <hi>Garden</hi> be in a ſandy Soil, muſt be ſown from the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to St. <hi>Lambert's</hi> Day, which is the ſeventeenth of this Month; and if it be in a ſtronger and heavier Soil, it muſt be ſown a little ſooner, and that always very thin, that in a Month's time, it may grow big enough to remove, that is to ſay, about as thick as ones Finger. It ſhould be planted till the middle of <hi>September,</hi> at ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Inches diſtance between Plant and Plant, that it may be replanted a ſecond time, and that nearer together, afterwards, at the beginning of <hi>September</hi> two or three Inches deep in the Earth, if it be dry and ſandy, or at leaſt in a ſloping Ground, without cutting off any thing from the Root, which has produced a little tuft, and it muſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48210:209"/>
be covered in froſty weather, to prevent the cold from rotting it to the very Heart, which caution being obſerved, it will keep till <hi>Lent,</hi> whereas <hi>Endive</hi> that is come to its full growth before the bitter cold weather, will not keep at all in <hi>Winter.</hi>

                              <p>This is peculiarly the Month of the greateſt Work and Labour of all, in order to the avoiding the inconvenience of wanting Garden neceſſaries, which is an ordinary Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this dead Seaſon, to thoſe that have been wanting in timely foreſight; for in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48210:210"/>
earneſt the <hi>Cold</hi> fails not to make great Havock in the Gardens of the lazy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the very beginning of the Month, how flatteringly fair ſoever the weather appear, there muſt be ſome dry long Dung brought and laid near the <hi>Endive, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, Chard Beets, Cellery, Leeks, Roots,</hi> &amp;c. that being ready at hand, it may with the more facility in few hours be thrown upon every thing that needs it, to prevent their deſtruction; and aſſoon as ever the <hi>Cold</hi> begins to declare it ſelf, we muſt begin to cover our <hi>Fig-Trees.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now is the proper time to make <hi>Plantations</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> and of <hi>Gooſe-berry, Curran,</hi> and <hi>Raſp-berry Shrubs,</hi> and 'tis good to continue on till the end of <hi>March,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be when it Freezes hard, or when the Earth is covered with a great deal of <hi>Snow.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>During all the ſame time, we ſet Trees and <hi>Shrubs</hi> in <hi>Baskets,</hi> which we diſpoſe of in ſome particular place, and eſpecially towards the <hi>Northern</hi> quarter. We ſet in them <hi>Standards</hi> as well as <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> keeping an exact account in writing of the order of the ſeveral kinds. Theſe <hi>Baskets</hi> are to be placed at half a foot diſtance one from the other, and muſt be ſo well interred, that but juſt their Brims at moſt may be diſcerned above Ground: And we couch in thoſe <hi>Baskets,</hi> ſuch <hi>Trees</hi> as are deſigned for <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> juſt in the ſame manner as if we were actually planting them by <hi>Walls,</hi> and thoſe which are deſigned to be planted in the open Air, we place upright in the middle of the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Aſſoon as the <hi>Froſts</hi> begin to appear, we begin to uſe the long Dung which we have been carefull to order to be brought and laid ready in needfull places; for example, if it be for <hi>Artichokes,</hi> we may keep them a little elevated towards the <hi>North,</hi> to ſerve them inſtead of a ſmall ſhelter, till we cover them quite, or elſe if we be preſſed with work to be done elſewhere, we cover them preſently, always taking care however before we cover them, to cut off all that is withered from them. A little of this Dung ſerves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt attacks, but we redouble our coverings as the <hi>Cold</hi> augments. They which are not provided with that ſort of dry Dung, may uſe inſtead of it, ſuch dry Leaves as are gathered up in the neighbouring Woods.</p>
                              <p>If we have a mind to whiten for <hi>Chards</hi> any of the biggeſt of thoſe <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants, we tie them below with two or three Bands, and then we wrap them about with long dry Dung, or ſtraw, which we bind over them again, as we have already directed when we were ſpeaking of <hi>Cardons.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In dry Soils, we earth up a little our <hi>Artichokes,</hi> which would be pernicious in wet Grounds, becauſe it would rot the <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants.</p>
                              <p>It is convenient to let the <hi>Artichokes</hi> alone ſo covered till the full <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>March</hi> be paſt, that being commonly very dangerous; and many Gard'ners are the cauſe of the loſs of their <hi>Artichokes,</hi> when they let themſelves be tempted by ſome fair days in <hi>March,</hi> to take off their coverings quite, and to proceed to manuring them; for if we uncover them, it ſhould at moſt, be but a little, and we ſhould always have that caution, to leave the Dung cloſe by them, to be ready at hand to cover them again, in caſe the <hi>Froſt</hi> returns.</p>
                              <p>At the very beginning of the Month, before the <hi>Froſts</hi> be come, we make an end of tying up our <hi>Endive</hi> that is big enough to ſuffer it, and we cover it with what we can get: we alſo cover our other <hi>Endive</hi> in the ſame manner, which we could not tie up. It likewiſe whitens equally well; and it is very convenient, if we have a conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to plant as many as we can of the biggeſt of them there, in tufts, as we ſhall further ſhew afterwards.</p>
                              <p>We cut down <hi>Aſparagus</hi> ſtalks when the Seed is Ripe, which we carefully lay up, if we be minded to ſow any of them in the following <hi>Spring.</hi> It would be dangerous to cut thoſe ſtalks ſooner, as well becauſe of ſpoiling the Seed, as the plants or ſtocks themſelves, which might by that means be irritated to an abortion, and producing before their time, ſome pitiful ſorry little new ſhoots.</p>
                              <p>We take the advantage of ſome fair dry weather, to lay up all we have a mind to keep for our Winters proviſion; and for that effect, we take up the plants in tufts, with Earth hanging to them, before they be <hi>Froſt</hi> bitten, and plant them very cloſe to one another in the <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> which are for Example, all <hi>Roots,</hi> as <hi>Carrots, Parſnips,</hi> and <hi>Beet-raves,</hi> or <hi>Red Beet Roots,</hi> and <hi>Artichokes,</hi> which have Fruit. The <hi>Green</hi> ones are more proper for this purpoſe than the <hi>Violet</hi> ones, which are more tender and leſs able to reſiſt the <hi>Froſt,</hi> and more apt to putrefie in that part next their ſtem, than the others which are more ruſtical and hardy. And alſo <hi>Spaniſh Cardons, Collyflowers</hi> and <hi>Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> as well the <hi>White,</hi> as the <hi>Wild</hi> ſort, and even <hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Cellery,</hi> though both
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48210:210"/>
theſe laſt will keep well enough in the naked Earth, when they are well covered: But here it is to be noted, that <hi>Cellery</hi> when once whitened muſt be eaten preſently, otherwiſe it would rot; And we muſt be carefull to raiſe ſome of it late, that may remain ſmall in the Earth, without being very much covered, which ſerves for the latter end of <hi>February</hi> and the Month of <hi>March.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thoſe Perſons who live near Woods, will do well to gather up the leaves there, not only to make uſe of for coverings, as I have ſaid, but likewiſe to lay them to rot in ſome hole, the powder of them being very good, and eſpecially to make uſe of for mold.</p>
                              <p>We now open and lay bare the Roots of Trees that ſeem to languiſh, in order to take from about them the old Soil, cut off as much of their Roots as is found in an ill condition, and Earth them up again afterwards with good new Earth.</p>
                              <p>We make ſome <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for <hi>Muſhrooms.</hi> The method to make them well, is to chooſe ſome ſpot of new, and as near as can be, light and ſandy Ground, and dig there a hollow <hi>Bed</hi> of five or ſix Inches deep, of three or four wide throughout, and of what length we pleaſe. The Dung muſt be either of <hi>Horſe,</hi> or <hi>Mule,</hi> and muſt be already pretty dry, and ſuch as has been piled up ſome time: Then we make the <hi>Bed</hi> about two foot high, ranking and preſſing the Dung as cloſe and tight as we can, yet ſo diſpoſing it that the upper part of it may be raiſed into a ridge like the Back of an Aſſe, that it may the better ſhoot off the waters to the right and left, which if they ſhould pierce through it, would rot the Dung; after that, we cover the <hi>Bed</hi> to the thickneſs of two foot more, with the Neighbouring Earth, over which again, we throw another covering of three or four Inches thick of Litter, which in the <hi>Winter</hi> may guard from the great <hi>Cold,</hi> and in the <hi>Summer,</hi> ſhade from the violent heat the <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> which may be expected to ſhoot up about three or four Months after.</p>
                              <p>We cleanſe Trees of Moſs that are troubled with it.</p>
                              <p>They which have great Plantations of <hi>Trees</hi> to prune, ſhould now begin that opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon thoſe which are leaſt vigorous.</p>
                              <p>We employ the long dry Dung of which we ought to have made proviſion in the <hi>Summer,</hi> to cover our <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> as well thoſe of the <hi>Wall,</hi> as <hi>Dwarfs;</hi> and for theſe laſt, we tie all their Branches as cloſe as we can conveniently, together with Oſier Withs, that we may the more eaſily wrap them about with this covering; and for the <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> we endeavour to leave ſo many of the higher Branches as we can, on the ſides, and to tie ſeveral of them together to poles or forked ſticks that are to ſerve them for Props, and by that means too, we cover them with more eaſe, and leſs charge. We leave on them that covering till the full <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>March</hi> be paſt, at which time, we only take off part of it, till the full <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>April</hi> be likewiſe paſt, the <hi>Froſts</hi> of theſe two laſt Months being dangerous to the young Fruit which then begins to put forth it ſelf, as the <hi>Winter Froſts</hi> are to the Wood which they make to turn all into Pith.</p>
                              <p>They whoſe <hi>Pear-Trees</hi> are peſtered with <hi>Tiger Babbs,</hi> will do well now, not only to gather up the Leaves that are attack'd by them, to burn them immediately, but alſo to ſcrape their Branches with the back of a Knife to clear them of the Eggs or Seed of that Curſed <hi>Inſect,</hi> which remains ſticking to them all <hi>Winter,</hi> for though we cannot ſo far prevail that way, as totally to exterminate them, yet however there will be ſo many Enemies deſtroyed, as we deſtroy of thoſe Eggs.</p>
                              <p>The days being now very ſhort, skilful Gard'ners will therefore work by Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light till Supper time, either in making of Straw-Screens and Coverings, or preparing Trees for planting, as ſoon as the Froſt permits them, or in deſigning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We put thoſe Trees into the Earth in furrows which we could not plant, covering up their Roots as carefully as if we were planting them in their deſigned places, without leaving any hollow Chinks about their Roots, becauſe otherwiſe the great Froſt would ſpoil them.</p>
                              <p>We may begin at the latter end of the Month to force ſuch <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> as are at leaſt three or four years old, and this forcing is performed, either on the cold <hi>Bed</hi> in the place where they grow, which is the beſt way, or elſe upon a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> if we be minded to remove them. But ordinarily we ſtay till towards the beginning of the next Month, before we make any Eſſays of that kind, it being in my Opinion, long enough to have of them for four Months together by Artifice, till <hi>Nature</hi> be ready to furniſh us with more of them for two Months longer by her own ſole Virtue and Power, not but that we might begin to force them at the very beginning of <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="170" facs="tcp:48210:211"/>
The way of forcing them is, to dig the Earth out of a Path, to the depth of two Foot, and the breadth of one full foot and a half, if originally the Path were but three Foot over, becauſe there muſt be at leaſt ſix or ſeven good inches of Earth be left next the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> Tufts. The Path being thus voided, we fill it up with long hot Dung, very well ramm'd and trodden down, till it be a full foot higher than the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the <hi>Cold Bed,</hi> at the firſt making, and after fifteen days, we ſtir this Dung over again, mixing ſome new Dung with it, the better to enable it to communicate ſufficient heat to the two adjoyning <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> but if it appear too much mortified, ſo that the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> does not ſhoot up briskly enough, then this recruiting of the path-way with freſh Dung and ſtirring, muſt be repeated afterwards as often as it ſhall be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which commonly happens to be once every ten or twelve days. If there fall any great Rains or Snow, that may have too much rotted that Dung, ſo that it appears not to retain a ſufficient heat, then muſt it be quite taken away, and all new put in its place; for in fine, this <hi>Bed</hi> muſt always be kept extreamly hot; as to the <hi>Cold Bed,</hi> in which the Plants are, the Ground muſt be digged up, and ſtirred a little in it, to the depth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five Inches, as ſoon as the path-way is filled up, for it cannot be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe of bringing the Dung to that, (which cannot be done without much trampling on the Soil) which digging being finiſhed, we cover the ſaid <hi>Cold Bed</hi> with ſome of the ſame long Dung, to the thickneſs of three or four Inches, and at the end of fifteen days, ſo much time at leaſt being neceſſary to give activity to thoſe <hi>Aſparagus</hi> Tufts, that in this Seaſon, are as 'twere dead, or at leaſt benumbed with the cold, we lift up the Dung to ſee whether the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> begin to ſhoot or no, and if they do, at every place where they appear, we clap a <hi>Glaſs Bell,</hi> which we alſo take great care to cover cloſe with long Dung, and eſpecially a-nights, to prevent the Froſt from penetrating in the leaſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the World, to the <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> which being ſo extreamly tender and delicate as 'tis, would be abſolutely ſpoiled by the leaſt breath of Cold. If in the day time, the Sun ſhine out a little bright, we muſt not fail to take off the Dung from the Bells, that the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> may be viſited by thoſe kindly beams that animate all things, and if beſides thoſe Bells, we had likewiſe <hi>Glaſs Frames</hi> to clap over them, and ſo doubly to cover whole Beds of Plants, that would ſtill be more commodious and more advantageous for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to effect this little <hi>Maſter-piece</hi> of our <hi>Art.</hi> By theſe helps, the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> ſpringing out of that warm Earth, and meeting with a warm Air under thoſe <hi>Bells,</hi> grow red and green, and of the ſame thickneſs and length as thoſe of the Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>IF it be a pertinent caution I have given at the beginning of every Month, That we ought then to be careful to finiſh what we could not do in the preceeding Month, it is particularly neceſſary to repeat it at the beginning of this Month, with reſpect to that which laſt expired. Aſſoon as <hi>December</hi> is come it is no longer time to dally. For now the Earth in <hi>Gardens</hi> is quite ſtrip'd of all its uſual ornaments, and the <hi>Froſt</hi> that ſeldom fails to ſignalize it ſelf this Month, without reſpecting the quality of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſpares no bodies <hi>Gardens,</hi> but unmercifully deſtroys all it meets with of a nature too delicate to endure its rigour; and therefore it concerns us now to make an end of houſing and of covering what we could not houſe or cover in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> viz. <hi>Endive, Cardons, Cellery, Artichokes, Roots, Collyflowers, Chard-Beets, Leeks, Fig-Trees,</hi> &amp;c. And above all things, we muſt be careful to preſerve thoſe <hi>Novelties</hi> which we may have begun to advance by <hi>Art,</hi> as <hi>Peas, Beans, Cabbage, Lettuce,</hi> and little <hi>Sallets,</hi>
                                 <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48210:212"/>
to avoid the diſpleaſure of ſeeing periſh in one bitter Night, what we have been labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three Months to advance.</p>
                              <p>We may likewiſe ſtill at the beginning of the Month, continue to ſow ſome early <hi>Peas,</hi> upon ſome banks made of Earth raiſed in double ſlopes along by ſome Wall placed in a good <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and eſpecially that towards the <hi>South.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We tranſport our rotten Dung to thoſe places we deſign to muck, and ſpread them abroad there, that the rain and <hi>Snow</hi> waters may the better penetrate them, and carry their Salt a little below the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth where our Seeds are to be ſown.</p>
                              <p>We interr our <hi>Almonds</hi> in ſome <hi>Basket,</hi> to Sprout. They ſhould have ſprouted by the Month of <hi>March,</hi> to be ready then to be planted in their allotted places. It is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prevent the great <hi>Froſt</hi> from coming at them; for which end the <hi>Baskets</hi> muſt be houſed up in the <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> or elſe well covered with long Dung if left in the naked Earth. The way to lay theſe <hi>Almonds</hi> to ſprout, is firſt to lay at the bottom of the <hi>Basket,</hi> a layer of Sand, Earth or mold, or made Earth between two and three Inches thick, and to lay a Layer of flat <hi>Almonds,</hi> upon it with their ſharp ends inwards, till its firſt layer of Earth be quite covered with the layer of <hi>Almonds,</hi> upon which we lay a ſecond layer of Mold or Sand of two Inches thick, and then upon that again a ſecond layer of <hi>Almonds</hi> placed in the ſame manner as the firſt, and ſo a third and fourth, &amp;c. till the <hi>Basket</hi> will hold no more.</p>
                              <p>It is likewiſe not amiſs to put one ſingle layer of <hi>Almonds</hi> into the naked-Earth, and to cover them with Earth, to the thickneſs of about three Inches: When they begin to come up at the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> we take them in up <hi>Turfs,</hi> that is, with ſome Earth hanging to them, and breaking off their ſprouts, we replant them in their deſigned places, in rows diſtant one from another, a foot and a half, and in thoſe rows, the <hi>Almonds</hi> muſt be placed at the diſtance of half a foot from each other.</p>
                              <p>We are buſie in making trails for <hi>Wall-Trees.</hi>

                              <p>We may prune <hi>Trees</hi> as long as there is no Icicles, or hoar upon the Branches, and as the hard <hi>Froſts</hi> do not raign, for they harden the Wood ſo that the pruning knife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily paſs: Always obſerving that we muſt never prune <hi>Wall-Trees</hi> without unnail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, becauſe it would be too troubleſom to do it otherwiſe, neither can we ſo well diſcern what Work we are to do.</p>
                              <p>One of the moſt principal Works of this Month, is, at the beginning of it, to make a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> of long new Dung of the ordinary breadth of four foot, and height of three, and aſſoon as its great heat is ſpent, we muſt ſow upon it, under <hi>Glaſs Bells,</hi> ſome good bright <hi>Curled Lettuce,</hi> and aſſoon as 'tis grown a little big, which uſually happens in a Month's time, we muſt take up the faireſt, and plant it in a <hi>Nurſery</hi> upon another <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> and under other <hi>Bells,</hi> to the number of twenty, or twenty five under every <hi>Bell,</hi> and when they are grown reaſonably big there too, we muſt take up the biggeſt with a little Earth about them, to replant them to the number of five or ſix under each <hi>Bell,</hi> to remain there till they be quite <hi>Cabbaged,</hi> which uſually happens towards the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> and we take care to fence them well from the <hi>Cold,</hi> as well with coverings of Litter, as by new heating their <hi>Beds.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>We practiſe the ſame method in ſowing theſe <hi>Lettuces</hi> in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> and in replanting in <hi>February,</hi> that we may have ſome ready betimes, that is, towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> and to continue ſo doing till the Earth produces us ſome of her ſelf, without the help of <hi>Hot</hi> Dung. At this time they that employ themſelves in rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Novelties,</hi> ſpend the moſt part of each day in covering them at night, and uncovering them in the morning, or elſe all comes to nothing.</p>
                              <p>When in the Winter time, we are raiſing and forcing of <hi>Lettuce</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> and under Bells, we muſt be careful often to lift up the Bells, to take away the dead Leaves, there being a great many that rot and periſh, and one rotten Leaf rots others. The inſide of the Bells muſt alſo be cleanſed from the filth and moiſture that gathers there in abundance, and when there comes a fair Sun ſhiny day, we muſt not fail to lift up the Bells, that the moiſture may be dryed up that ſticks about the Leaves. But the chiefeſt thing to be obſerved above all, is to keep the Beds moderately hot, by recruiting and new heating, and fermenting them from time to time.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>How to judge certainly by viewing and viſiting a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> whether there be any thing wanting in it, which it ſhould be ſtockt with.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is no inconſiderable thing to underſtand certainly, not only what Proviſions a Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Garden well maintained and ordered may furniſh us with every Month in the Year, but likewiſe what works are to be done there in every Seaſon, by an able Gard'ner, but yet that is not enough to make a Gentleman ſo knowing, as to be able to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Pleaſure to judge certainly by viewing of his <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> whether it be indeed ſo well ſtockt or no, as to want nothing that it ſhould have. For in fine, we muſt not expect always actually to find init, all the advantages we are beholding to Gardens for. We know indeed, that it ſhould bring forth a proviſion for the whole Year, but we know very well too, that it does not bring forth all days in the Year, for example, in the Winter Months we hardly ſee in it any of its Productions, the moſt part of them being then carried out of it, and laid up in Store-houſes and Conſervatories. And beſides, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Plants that are to be ſeen in it at other times, how many is there which have not then attain'd to their perfection, which yet ought to make a Figure in this Garden, though they require perhaps two or three, and ſometimes five or ſix Months time to arrive to it? Thus it is in the beginning of the Spring, with all Legumes or Edible Plants, and green things, and thus it is too in the <hi>Summer,</hi> with the principal Fruits of the other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon which Conſideration, I thought it not impertinent nor unuſeful, to ſhew yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48210:215"/>
a little more particularly wherein conſiſts the excellency and accompliſhment of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> judging of it acccording to the proportion of what we ought to find in it every time we go into it, and to give you the more exact and perfect an Idea of it, I will as near as I can, draw you the picture of our Kings, which is in its kind, the greateſt that ever was beheld, as its Maſter is the greateſt Prince that ever yet appeared; not, that I exhibit this Picture to engage any Perſon to copy it, but only to direct them how by the Rules of a juſt Compariſon, and proportion of great things to little, they may take ſuch Meaſures, as they ſhall think moſt accommodated to their own particular conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
                        <p>I will begin this Chapter with the Month of <hi>January,</hi> as I have done the two next preceeding ones, and ſhall tell you firſt, That in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> we ought to <note place="margin">January.</note> be very well ſatisfied with the Garden in Queſtion, if we find in it a reaſonable quantity of <hi>Winter Lettuces</hi> planted in Borders by Walls, and covered with long Straw, or Straw Screens. And Secondly, if we find in it ſome Squares of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> and <hi>Beet-Chards</hi> well covered with long Dung, with the like proviſion of <hi>Cellery, Endive, Common Parſly,</hi> and <hi>Macedonian Parſly,</hi> or <hi>Aliſanders,</hi> &amp;c. and ordered after the ſame manner. And in the third place, ſome <hi>Winter Cabbages, Ciboules, Sorrel,</hi> and <hi>Sallet</hi> Furnitures, and if theſe two laſt be ſheltred with ſome ſort of Covering. And if in the fourth place there be ſome ſquares of <hi>Aſparagus</hi> without any other Artifice, than what is uſed to warm and force them in their <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> as I do, and have begun to do in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December.</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kitchen-plants muſt be houſed and laid up, as <hi>Roots, Onions, Cardons, Artichokes, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyflowers,</hi> &amp;c. In the fifth place, we may be content if we find the <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> well covered, all places where Trees ſhould be, well filled up with <hi>Trees,</hi> or at leaſt, with holes dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and Trenches prepared, ready for planting them, or the Roots of thoſe bared and laid open, that begin to languiſh, in order to their Cure. Sixthly, if we ſee Men buſie in clearing the Fruit-Trees of Moſs, and other filth that Spoils them, and if over and above that, we find there any <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for the Novelties of the Spring time, ſuch as are <hi>Strawberries, Radiſhes, Little Sallets, Peas, Beans, Cabbage Lettuces, Parſly, Cucumbers,</hi> and <hi>Musk-melon</hi> Plantations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we likewiſe ſee ſome <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> and ſome other Trees forced and advanced by artificial Warmth, what then ought we not to ſay in praiſe of the Gard'ner, eſpecially if we find the Walks and Alleys kept neat and clean, and no Garden Tools or Utenſils any where neglected?</p>
                        <p>Having told you what ſhould compoſe the Beauty of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> I think it needleſs to add any Deſcription of what makes it imperfect and diſagreeable as well in that Month, as in all the reſt of which I ſhall afterwards treat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any Body may eaſily diſcern of himſelf, that 'tis juſt the contrary and reverſe of what I have juſt now ſpecified, that is to ſay, a want of any thing that ſhould be in it, Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Slovinglyneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we are to look upon as the Monſters of <hi>Kitchen Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> we muſt certainly expect to ſee the beginning of a great Buſtling and Activity in Garden works, we ſhould now find the moſt part of thoſe things <note place="margin">February.</note> flouriſhing, and grown pretty forward, that we told you were to be raiſed on <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> in the preceeding Month, and if about the latter end of the Month, the Weather appear pretty temperate, and there happen ſo conſiderable a Thaw as to promiſe an end of the great cold, our Gard'ners ſhould then begin to dig and manure the Squares and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Borders prepare the <hi>Cold Beds,</hi> ſow thoſe ſorts of Seeds that are long coming up, as <hi>Parſly, Onions, Ciboules, Leeks,</hi> &amp;c. They muſt likewiſe now earneſtly mind the pruning of Trees, as well <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> as <hi>Wall-Trees,</hi> and paliſade or nail up theſe laſt for the firſt time, and particularly they muſt take care to make <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for the replanting of <hi>Musk-melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and for little <hi>Sallets, Radiſhes, Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>March,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi> begins to pleaſure us with both indifferent fair, and pretty long days, and nature begins viſibly to grow warm and active, our <hi>Gard'ners</hi> alſo ſhould <note place="margin">March.</note> with new and freſh vigour, and Application, beſtir themſelves in all parts of their <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and be ſeen indefatigably to purſue all the works I have mentioned in the particular Treatiſe I made on that ſubject, and which therefore 'tis not neceſſary to repeat here again; ſo that if the extent of our Ground be great, and the number of Labourers propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, we ſhould have the pleaſure with one caſt of an Eye to ſee them diging, making up, ſowing, planting, howing, weeding, graffing, pruning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for in fine, before the Month be out, the moſt part of the Ground ſhould be taken up either with Seeds or plants, which are to ſerve for proviſion for the whole year. All that was before covered with Dung, ought to be diſcharged of its coverings, which are now grown hidious, aſſoon as they ceaſe to be neceſſary, and every thing ought to breath the free Air, which begins now to cheer both Animals and Plants; we ſhould at this time have at leaſt ſomething to begin to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48210:215"/>
gather, either of <hi>Sallets</hi> or <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> of the new Seaſon, if the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> of the foregoing Months have not as yet obliged us with that pleaſure; But neatneſs and politeneſs ought particularly to glitter every where, and ſerve for a varniſh to all the Alleys, and the dreſſed Grounds, that together with the firſt dawning of the riſing Green that is now ſpringing out of the Womb of the teeming Earth, and the perfumed breath of thoſe Plants which Heavens richer influences have made odoriferous, and the abundance of <hi>Flowers</hi> which begin to diſplay their beauties on every ſide, and the harmony of the pretty Birds, which a ſort of extraordinary gayety and briskneſs at this time inſpires with amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous prattle, and with melodious Airs to ſtrive to out-vie each other. This neatneſs may concurr to make a Theater of pleaſure univerſally perfect, which may with irreſiſtible allurements intice the curious to the divertiſement of walking in ſo delicious a place.</p>
                        <p>In the Month of <hi>April,</hi> we are not to find any thing new to be done in our <hi>Kitchen-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">April.</note> unleſs it be an augmentation of <hi>Hot Beds</hi> for <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers.</hi> The Earth in them ſhould now be covered almoſt all over with a new decoration of Infant Plants; Here we ſhould ſee <hi>Artichokes</hi> riſing as 'twere from the dead, and there <hi>Aſparagus</hi> piercing the Ground in a thouſand places; here we ſhould with pleaſure obſerve the <hi>Cabbage Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce</hi> wind up it ſelf into round Balls, and here that multitude of Green Herbs, and <hi>Legumes,</hi> ſo different in colour, and ſo various in their ſhapes; Theſe, theſe are the Innocent and natural Dainties which there preſent themſelves for the nouriſhment, and Delicious entertainment of Humane kind. The <hi>Jacinth,</hi> the <hi>Tulip,</hi> the <hi>Anemone,</hi> the <hi>Ranimculus,</hi> and ſo many other <hi>Flowers,</hi> with what Glories do they not adorn the <hi>Gardens</hi> where they are? That which is here to be remarked, is only the ordinary main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of what is already done and perfected; but that which ſhould moſt take up our thoughts is the hopes of a future crop of <hi>Fruits,</hi> every one now being eager to run and view the <hi>Trees</hi> that ſhed their Bloſſoms, to ſee whether much <hi>Fruit</hi> knit upon them or no, or elſe to viſit the <hi>Hot Beds</hi> of <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers</hi> that ſeem to have taken well, to ſee how liberally they are like to recompence them for all the pains beſtowed upon them.</p>
                        <p>When the Month of <hi>May</hi> comes in, what contentment have we not in uſeful <note place="margin">May.</note> 
                           <hi>Gardens;</hi> and how great are the ſweets of enjoyment which we begin then to taſte?

The <hi>Straw-berries</hi> beginning to come now to maturity open and lead the way to the other <hi>Red Fruits</hi> which are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to follow after them: <hi>Green Peas</hi> are ready to ſatisfie the longing Appetire of the lickeriſh Palate. <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> ſhoot up in Crowds; and in fine, of all the things contained in the Alphabet I have premiſed before this Treatiſe, there is hardly any but <hi>Spinage,</hi> and <hi>Mâches,</hi> that ſtave off the performance of their duty till <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> for we may now ſee ſome little beginnings even of <hi>Endive,</hi> and if <hi>Haſting</hi> or <hi>Early Cherries</hi> were the firſt <hi>Fruit</hi> that appeared in this Month of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Haſting Apricocks,</hi> the <hi>Little Muſcat Pears,</hi> and the <hi>Avant Peaches,</hi> or <hi>Forward Peaches</hi> will not leave them long alone to enjoy the glory of being the ſole Riches and Ornaments of our <hi>Gardens,</hi> all theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> being now preparing themſelves to appear in a very few days; the <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> likewiſe will not ſtay long behind them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while the <hi>Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> with an infinite number both of <hi>Lettuces</hi> and of other Plants, ſatisfie both our Palates and Neceſſities, as the <hi>Flowers</hi> together with the <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which in <hi>Mid-May</hi> we carry abroad out of their houſes, perform likewiſe their functions in delighting both our Sight and Smell.</p>

We gather in all parts, and at the ſame time with profuſion diſtribute all thoſe Plants that are become ſo beautiful and accompliſh'd; we fill up the places again we had disfurniſh'd, ſo that there hardly ever remains any part void; and nature now affects no better divertiſement than to be amazing us with miracles of fertillity, ſo well aſſiſted as ſhe is, by the kindly warmth of the Father of Light; only ſhe needs now and then the Auxiliary refreſhment of convenient moiſture, moiſture which the propitious Clouds ſometimes abundantly pour down, but which ſometimes the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Induſtry too is fain to ſupply her with in time of need. The <hi>Cold Beds</hi> and <hi>Counterborders</hi> Levelled and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted ſo even to a line, and ſo well furniſh'd with <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> what pleaſure do they not afford to behold them?

                        <p>As for example have we a mind to all or any ſorts of Herbs, Roots, <hi>Sallets, Perfumes,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>If in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> our <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> have ſignalized themſelves by their <hi>Musk-Melons, Cucumbers, Legumes,</hi> and even by their <hi>Plums,</hi> their firſt <hi>Figs,</hi> and ſome few <note place="margin">September <hi>and</hi> October.</note>

                           <p>What ſort of Ground is Proper to each Legume and Kitchen-Plant.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is certain, there are certain ſorts of Grounds which want none of the good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required to make them produce in every Seaſon, and for a long time together, all ſorts of fair and good <hi>Legumes,</hi> ſuppoſing always, that they be reaſonably well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: And there are ſome that beſides that, have the faculty to produce them more early ſome than others, and they are ſuch Grounds as they commonly call Black Sands, in which is found an equal temper between dry and moiſt, accompanied with a good expoſition, and with an inexhauſtible Salt of fertility, rendring them eaſie to be entred by the ſpade, and to be penetrated by the rain waters: But on the other hand, it is no leſs certain that it is rare enough to find any of theſe perfect ſorts of Earth, and that on the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48210:217"/>
contrary, it is very uſual to meet with thoſe that offend either in being too dry, light, and parching, or over moiſt, heavy and cold, or elſe by being unfortunately ſituated, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of them too high, ſome too ſloping, and ſome again too low, and too much in a bottom. Happy are thoſe Gard'ners that meet with thoſe firſt ſorts of Ground that are ſo admirably well diſpoſed for Cultivation, in which they have hardly ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bad ſucceſs to fear, but commonly all manner of good Fortune to expect: on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide unhappy, or at leaſt much to be pitied are thoſe whoſe Lot it is to have always ſome of the great Enemies of Vegetation to combat with, I mean, either great drought, or more eſpecially exceſſive moiſture, becauſe this laſt, beſides that it is always attended with a chilling cold that retards its productions, is likewiſe apt to rot the greateſt part of the Plants, and conſequently, it is very difficult to correct, and almoſt impoſſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to ſurmount ſo great a defect, but it is not altogether ſo difficult to qualifie a dry temper, for provided it be not extream great, and that we have the convenience of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to water it, and of Dung to amend and inrich it, we are Maſters of two Soveraign and Infallible Remedies, which we muſt apply for its cure. And ſo by care and pains we may get the Conqueſt over thoſe dry and ſtubborn Lands, and force them to bring forth in abundance all things we ſhall regularly demand of them.</p>
                        <p>It follows thence, that when we are ſo happy as to meet with thoſe choice good ſorts of Ground, we may indifferently both ſow and plant every where in them, any ſorts of Legumes or Plants whatſoever, with an aſſured Confidence, that they will proſper there. The only Subjection we are obliged to in ſuch Grounds is, firſt, to weed much, becauſe they produce abundance of Weeds among the good Herbs, and ſecondly to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten removing our Legumes, and changing their places, which is an eſſential point of Practice in all ſorts of Gardens, it being not at all convenient to place for two or three times together, the ſame Vegetables in the ſame piece of Ground, becauſe the Nature of the Earth requires theſe ſorts of Changes, as being as 'twere aſſured in this Diverſity, to find wherewithall to recruit and perpetuate its firſt vigour. And though in thoſe good Grounds all things proſper admirably well, yet is it a moſt undoubted truth, that <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Expoſitions are here as well as every where elſe, more proper than thoſe of the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> to forward, and improve its productions, witneſs <hi>Strawberries, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Peas, Cherries</hi> and <hi>Muſcat-Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> To balance which, theſe laſt Expoſitions have likewiſe ſome peculiar advantages, that make them to be eſteemed in their turn; for Example, during the exceſſive heats of <hi>Summer,</hi> that often ſcorch up every thing, and make our Legumes and other plants run up too haſtily to Seed, they are exempt from thoſe violent impreſſions, which the Sun makes upon thoſe places that are fully expoſed to his burning Rays, and conſequently our Plants will, maintain themſelves longer in good plight in thoſe ſituations than in the others.</p>
                        <p>It alſo follows from hence, that if any Perſon have Ground, though tolerably good, yet not of an equal goodneſs all over, either cauſed by the difference of its natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or ſituation, and ſloping inclination upwards or downwards, that then I ſay, the skill and induſtry of the Gard'ner ſhews it ſelf, by knowing how to allot every plant the place in which it may beſt come to maturity in every Seaſon, as well in regard of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and ſometimes of Backwardneſs, as of its outward Beauty, and inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>Generally ſpeaking, thoſe Grounds that are moderately dry, light, and ſandy, and ſuch as though they be a little ſtrong and heavy, are ſituated on a gentle riſing towards the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> and are backed by great Mountains, or fenced by high Walls againſt the Cold Winds, are more diſpoſed to produce the Novelties of the Spring, than the ſtrong, heavy, fat and moiſt Sands, but likewiſe on the other Hand, in Summers when there falls but little Rain, theſe laſt produce thicker and better nouriſht Legumes, and require not ſuch large and frequent Waterings, ſo that we may find ſome ſort of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Satisfaction in all ſorts of Grounds.</p>
                        <p>However though abſolutely ſpeaking, all things that may enter into a <hi>Kitchen-Garden,</hi> may grow in all ſorts of Grounds that are not altogether Barren, yet it has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all times, that all ſorts of Earth agree not equally with all ſorts of Plants, our able Market Gard'ners in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris,</hi> juſtifie the truth of this by a moſt convincing Experience, for we ſee that ſuch of them whoſe Gardens are in Sandy Grounds, ſeldom mind to plant in them any <hi>Artichokes, Collyflowers, Beet-Chards, Onions, Cardons, Cellery, Beet-raves</hi> or <hi>Red Beet-Roots,</hi> and other Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoſe do that have theirs in ſtronger and more hearty Lands, and on the contrary, theſe laſt employ not their Ground in <hi>Sorrel, Purſlain, Lettuce, Endive,</hi> and other ſmall plants that are delicate and ſubject to periſh with Mildew, and the wet rot as do thoſe whoſe Gardens are in light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Lands.</p>

                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48210:217"/>
From all that I have aſſerted, there reſult two things, the firſt is, that an able Gard'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which has a pretty dry or hilly Ground to cultivate with an Obligation to have of all ſorts of things in his Garden, ſhould place in the moiſteſt parts thoſe plants that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little moiſture to bring them to perfection, as <hi>Artichokes, Red Beet-Roots, Scorzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera's, Salſiſies, Carrots, Parſnips, Skirrets, Beet-Chards, Collyflowers</hi> and <hi>Cabbages, Spinage, Common Peas, Beans, Currans, Gooſeberries, Raſpberries, Onions, Ciboules, Leeks, Parſly, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Radiſhes, Patience</hi> or <hi>Dock-Sorrel, Sweet Herbs, Borage Bugloſs,</hi> &amp;c. And (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Proviſions above ſpecified, without which nothing will be ſightly, be already planted in its other parts) he ſhould fill up the drier parts of the ſame Garden with <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces</hi> of all Seaſons, <hi>Endive, Succory, Chervil, Tarragon, Baſil, Burnet, Mint,</hi> and other Sallet-Furnitures, and <hi>Purſlain, Garlick, Shalots, Winter-Cabbages, Hot Beds</hi> of all ſorts of Plants, and of little Sallets; he may likewiſe plant in the ſame places what <hi>Grapes</hi> he has a mind to, and he muſt place his <hi>Legumes</hi> there at moderate diſtances, becauſe they grow not of ſo large a Size and Stature there, as in fatter places. And laſtly, he muſt keep his Walks and Path-ways higher than his dreſſed Grounds, as well to draw into theſe latter the Rain waters that would be but unuſeful and incommodious in the Walks, as to render the artificial waterings he ſhall be obliged to uſe, of the greater advantage to them, by preventing them from running out any where aſide, which muſt be one of his principal Applications.</p>
                        <p>He muſt alſo chuſe out in the ſame Grounds thoſe Parts which come the neareſt to the good temper between dry and moiſt, for the raiſing of <hi>Aſparagus, Strawberries, Cardons, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe theſe ſorts of Plants languiſh with drowth in places too dry, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with rottenneſs in parts over-moiſt. He muſt place in the Borders under his Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Walls his <hi>Alleluia's, Latter Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Bourdelais,</hi> or <hi>Verjuice Grapes,</hi> and in the Counter-Borders of the ſame Northern Quarter, he may make his <hi>Nurſery Beds</hi> for <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and ſow <hi>Chervil</hi> all the Summer long, the North ſide in all ſorts of Grounds, being moſt proper for thoſe purpoſes. And as this Gard'ner ſhould be curious of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, he ought to look upon the Banks under the Walls towards the South and Eaſt to be a marvellous and favourable ſhelter for the raiſing them; as for Example, for the procuring of <hi>Strawberries</hi> and early <hi>Peas</hi> at the beginning of <hi>May, Violets</hi> at the entrance of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces</hi> at the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> He ſhould likewiſe plant in the dreſſed Banks next to the ſame Eaſtern and Weſtern Walls, his Nurſery of <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and ſow there his <hi>Winter Lettuces,</hi> that is, <hi>Shell-Lettuces,</hi> to remain there all Autumn and Winter, till in the Spring it be time to tranſplant them into the places where they are to come to perfection; He ſhould likewiſe plant in the Borders of the ſame Walls, his <hi>Paſſe-pierre,</hi> or <hi>Sampire,</hi> which he can hardly have by any other means, which courſe is to be followed in all ſorts of Gardens; and in the Winter time he ſhould likewiſe obſerve this particular caution to throw all the Snow off from the neighbouring places upon the dreſſed Borders of thoſe <hi>Wall-trees,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of the Eaſtern Quarter, both for the erecting of a Magazine, as 'twere of moiſture in ſuch places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Rain but ſeldom falls, as upon thoſe in which the violent heat of Summer is like to be of pernicious influence.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing that Reſults from what I before laid down, is, That the Gard'ner whoſe Garden is in a very fat and moiſt Ground, muſt take a quite contrary method with all his Plants to that juſt now above mentioned; always aſſuring himſelf that thoſe parts of it which are very moiſt, unleſs he can find means to drain and render them lighter, will be of no other uſe to him than to produce noxious Weeds, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thoſe which partake the leaſt of that intemperature, whether by their own Nature and Situation, or by the care and induſtry of the ingenious Gard'ner, are always to be lookt upon as the beſt for all ſorts of things. He muſt place in the drieſt parts moſt of thoſe Plants that keep in their places for ſeveral years together, excepting <hi>Currans, Gooſe-berries,</hi> and <hi>Raſpberry</hi> Buſhes; as for Example, <hi>Aſparagus, Artichokes, Strawberries, Wild Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> &amp;c. In other places, let him put thoſe things which in Summer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the leaſt time to come to perfection, <hi>viz. Sallets, Peas, Beans, Radiſhes,</hi> nay and <hi>Cardons, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. and becauſe all things grow thick and tall in thoſe fat and moiſt places, therefore he muſt plant his <hi>Kitchen-plants</hi> there, at greater diſtances one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than in drier places; he muſt alſo keep his Beds and dreſſed Grounds, raiſed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his Walks and Path-ways, to help to drain out of his Grounds the Water that is ſo hurtful to his Plants, and for that Reaſon, his <hi>Beds</hi> of <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> eſpecially, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his <hi>Strawberry</hi> and <hi>Cellery Beds,</hi> &amp;c. no more than thoſe of his Sallets muſt not be made Hollow, as thoſe muſt be that are made in drier Grounds.</p>

                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:48210:218"/>
I have had good Succeſs in the new <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> where the Ground is fat, viſcous, and as 'twere Clayie, by raiſing in the midſt of it, certain large ſquares where the frequent Rain Waters in the Summer, of the Year 1682. remained without penetrating above ſeven or eight Inches deep, and by having given to the ſaid ſquares by the means of that elevation, a ſloping deſcent on each ſide, all along the bottom of which I made at the ſame time ſome little dikes or water-courſes about a foot deep, as well to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſquares from the Counterborders as particularly to receive the miſchievous waters which by ſtaying on the ſquares, otherwiſe would ruine all the Plants in them; which waters afterwards diſcharged themſelves into ſtone gutters which I had purpoſely ordered to be made to carry them off. I afterwards raiſed moſt of the Counterborders in the ſame manner, Arch-wiſe, that what water might remain in them might ſhoot off into the ſides of the walks, all along which there were other little dikes almoſt unperceivable, to receive thoſe waters and convey them into the ſame ſtone gutters-newly above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and I can truly affirm, that before I uſed this precaution, all that I had in thoſe ſquares, not only of Kitchen-Plants, even to the moſt ruſtical and hardy ſort of them, as <hi>Artichokes, Beet-Chards,</hi> &amp;c. but to the very <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> were viſibly perceived to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, the Plants with the rot, and the <hi>Trees</hi> with the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> beſides which miſchiefs, the winds eaſily threw up my <hi>Trees</hi> by the Roots, becauſe they could hardly take any faſt hold in that kind of Ground that were grown liquid and ſoft like new made mortar, or Pap. My forecaſt and diligence were a great help to me in that caſ, eand I ſincerely adviſe all thoſe that ſhall have to do with places of the like difficulty, to uſe the ſame method, if they can find out no better expedient.</p>
                        <p>The reaſoning by which I was induced to this way of proceeding, was this: That though the exceſſive quantity of water did reduce that unhappy ſort of Ground to a kind of Marſh, and thereby diſpoſed it afterwards by the operation of the great heat to grow as hard as a ſtone, and conſequently rendred it uncapable of culture in either of thoſe two ſtates wet, or dry, yet I ſay, my reaſon ſuggeſted to me, that if I could hinder the firſt inconvenience which was the rendring of this Ground too Liquid and Marſhy, it would be an infallible means to ſecure me againſt the ſecond, which was to ſee them grow hard and ſtony, becauſe I concluded, that if my Grounds having been once made light and looſe, could be kept reaſonably dry after that, as they would be if the waters were hindred from lodging in them, they would not be any more ſo cloſely glued together as to grow into any ſuch kind of ſtony conſiſtence, but would become tractable like other Lands; and accordingly I found my reaſoning anſwered by the ſucceſs which I expected.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>What ſort of Culture is moſt proper for every particular Plant.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is a very conſiderable Advance to have ſettled a <hi>Garden</hi> upon a good foot at firſt and to have wiſely employed, or at leaſt aſſigned out all its parts according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualifications of its Ground, the goodneſs of its Expoſitions, the order of the Months, and the nature of each Plant; But that is not all, we muſt likewiſe carefully cultivate them, in ſuch a manner as they peculiarly require.</p>
                        <p>For there is a general Culture of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> and there is a particular Culture peculiar to each Plant. As to the general Culture, it is well enough known, that the moſt neceſſary and important points of it conſiſt firſt, in well amending and mucking the Earth, whether it be naturally good or not, becauſe <hi>Kitchen-Plants</hi> exhauſt it much; ſecondly, in keeping it always looſe and ſtirred, either by digging up whole <hi>Beds,</hi> to Sow or tranſplant in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſuch other places where the ſpade may be employed, as for Example, among <hi>Artichokes, Cardons,</hi> &amp;c. or by pecking and grubbing up where the cloſeneſs of the Plants to one another, will permit us to uſe only grubbing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as for Example, among <hi>Straw-berries, Lettuces, Endive, Peas, Beans, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, in watering plentifully all ſorts of Plants in very <hi>Hot</hi> weather, and eſpecially in ſandy Grounds, for thoſe that are ſtrong and rank require not ſo much, always obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in both ſorts of Ground, watering is not ſo neceſſary for <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> nor for borders or edgings of <hi>Time, Sage, Lavender, Hiſſop, Rue, Worm-wood,</hi> &amp;c. which need but little moiſture to keep them in good plight; Fourthly, it conſiſts in keeping the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48210:218"/>
Superficies of our Ground clear of all ſorts of Weeds, either by Weeding, or digging, or by only raking them over, when they have not been long dreſſed, ſo that as far as 'tis poſſible, the Earth may always appear as if it had been newly ſtirred up.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not inſiſt any longer here upon the head of the General Culture, becauſe it is ſo well known to all people, but ſhall only declare my Opinion and the practice of able <hi>Gard'ners</hi> in that which is peculiarly to be uſed to each particular plant.</p>
                        <p>And I ſhall begin with obſerving to you, that among <hi>Kitchen-Plants,</hi> there are ſome that are Sown to remain ſtill in the place where they were firſt, and others again, only to be tranſplanted elſewhere; that there are ſome that prove well both ways; ſome that are multiplied without Seed, ſome that are tranſplanted whole, and ſome that are cut to be tranſplanted; that there are ſome which for the ſupply of Man-kind, bear ſeveral times in a year, and that laſt longer than a year; others that produce but once in a year, but yet laſt to bear for ſeveral years after; and Laſtly ſome again, that periſh after their firſt production.</p>
                        <p>The Plants of the firſt <hi>Claſs,</hi> are <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> almoſt all <hi>Red Beet-Roots, Carrots, Parſnips, Skirrets, Turneps, Maches, Reponces, Scorzonera's, Salſifies,</hi> and beſides them, <hi>Garlick, Chervil, Wild Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory, Harts-Horn Sallet, Garden-Creſſes, Shallots, Spinage, Beans,</hi> ſmall <hi>Lettuce</hi> to cut, <hi>Parſly, Burnet, Cutting Beets, Peas, Purſlain,</hi> &amp;c. and the greateſt part of our <hi>Sorrel, Patience</hi> or <hi>Sharp-Leav'd Dock, Onions,</hi> and <hi>Ciboulees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Plants of the ſecond <hi>Claſs</hi> which ſucceed not without being tranſplanted, are <hi>Chard-Beets, Cellery,</hi> and the greateſt part of our White <hi>Endive,</hi> both long and tied, and <hi>Cabbages,</hi> unleſs they be ſown very thin, or be very much thinn'd after they are ſown; of this <hi>Claſs</hi> are alſo <hi>Cabbages,</hi> moſt <hi>Musk-Melons,</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers, Citrulls</hi> or <hi>Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, Potirons</hi> or flat <hi>Pumpions, Leeks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe of the third <hi>Claſs,</hi> that is, ſuch as may be indifferently either continued in the places where they are firſt ſown, or tranſplanted elſewhere, are <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> though moſt commonly they are ſown at firſt in <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> to be tranſplanted a year or two after; as alſo <hi>Baſil, Fennel, Anis, Borage, Bugloſs, Cardons, Capucin Capers</hi> or <hi>Naſturies, Ciboulees, Savory, Time, Musked Chervil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The Plants of the fourth <hi>Claſs</hi> that are multiplied without being ſown, are <hi>Alleluia,</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel,</hi> Engliſh <hi>Cives, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe they grow into thick Tufts which are ſeparated into many; <hi>Artichokes</hi> are propagated by their <hi>Eyes, Off-ſets,</hi> or <hi>Slips; Mint,</hi> and <hi>Round Sorrel, Tripe Madame, Tarragon, Balm,</hi> &amp;c. by their Layers or Branches that take Root where they touch the Earth, the two laſt of which have alſo the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of multiplying by Seed, as likewiſe have the <hi>Artichokes</hi> ſometimes. <hi>Straw-berries</hi> propagate by their Runners, <hi>Raſp-berries, Gooſe-berries,</hi> and <hi>Currans,</hi> by their <hi>Slips,</hi> or <hi>Suckers,</hi> and by their Cuttings which alſo take Root. <hi>Lavender, Worm-wood, Sage, Time,</hi> and <hi>Marjoram,</hi> by their Branches which take Root at their joints, and are alſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by their Seed; the common <hi>Bays,</hi> both by Layers and Seed too; <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> by their <hi>Suckers,</hi> Hooked <hi>Slips,</hi> and Cuttings whether Rooted or not Rooted.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, thoſe Plants of which we cut off ſome part either of the Leaves or Roots or both at the ſame time, in order to tranſplant them, are <hi>Artichokes, Chard-Beets, Leeks, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. And thoſe others whoſe Leaves we do not cut at all, though it be good always to trim their Roots a little to refreſh them, are <hi>Endive,</hi> and <hi>Succory,</hi> moſt commonly, and <hi>Savory, Sorrel,</hi> &amp;c. and all <hi>Lettuces, Alleluia</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel, Violets, Baſil, Arrach</hi> or <hi>Orage, Borage, Bugloſs, Capucin Capers</hi> or <hi>Naſturces, Cabbages, Tarragon, Samphire, Straw-berries, Marjoram, Musk-Melons, Cucumbers, Citrulls</hi> or <hi>Pumpions, Purſlain;</hi> and <hi>Radiſhes</hi> for Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Plants that bring forth ſeveral times in a year, and yet laſt for ſome years follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are <hi>Sorrel, Patience</hi> or <hi>Sharp Dock, Alleluia</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel, Burnet, Chervil, Parſley, Fennel,</hi> all Edging, or Sweet Herbs, <hi>Wild Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory, Macedonian Parſley</hi> or <hi>Aliſanders, Mint, Tarragon, Samphire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that produce but once in the year, but yet laſt bearing for ſeveral years together afterwards, are <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> and <hi>Artichokes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Laſtly, thoſe that ceaſe to be uſeful after their firſt production, are all <hi>Lettuces,</hi> Common <hi>Endive, Peas, Beans, Cardons, Melons, Cucumbers, Citrulls</hi> or <hi>Pumpions, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Leeks, Cellery, Arrach</hi> or <hi>Orage,</hi> and all Plants whoſe Roots are only in uſe, as <hi>Red Beets, Carrots,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now to give you a particular account of the Culture that belongs to every ſeveral ſort of Plant, I muſt tell you, that this Culture conſiſts, firſt, in obſerving the diſtances they are to be placed at one from the other; ſecond, in the Triming of ſuch as need it;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48210:219"/>
third, in planting them in that ſituation, and diſpoſition, which they require; fourth, in giving them thoſe aſſiſtances which ſome of them have need of to bring them to perfection, or which are convenient for them, whether it be by typing up, or wrapping about, or Earthing up, or otherwiſe covering them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                                 <hi>Alleluia,</hi> or <hi>Wood-Sorrel,</hi> when it grows old, grows into Tufts, and being a Plant that grows in the Woods, and conſequently that loves the ſhade, we therefore plant it along by the ſides of our <hi>Northern</hi> Walls, at the diſtance of about one foot between one plant and another; the more we ſtrip it of its Leaves, which is one good quality it has, the more freſh ones it ſhoots forth: It is enough to ſet it two Inches into the Ground; it laſts three or four years without being renewed, and to renew it, we need do no more than to ſeparate or ſlip out the great Tufts of it into ſeveral little ones, and replant them again immediately, which is to be done in the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> a little watering in very <hi>Hot</hi> weather, and eſpecially in ſandy Grounds, is a very great and welcome help to them.</p>

                                 <hi>Anis</hi> and <hi>Fennel</hi> are commonly ſown pretty thin, either in ſurrows, or borders; their Leaves are uſed in <hi>Sallets</hi> among other Furnitures.

The Leaf of this plant is very good both in pottage, and in ſtuffings or farces; we uſe it almoſt as ſoon as it peeps out of the Earth, for it paſſes away very quickly; and to have ſome the more early, we ſow a little quantity of it upon a <hi>Hot Bed:</hi> It thrives well enough in all ſorts of Grounds, but yet it grows always fairer in good Grounds than in but indifferent ones.</p>

                                 <hi>Artichokes,</hi> as we have already elſewhere told you, are multiplied by their Eyes, Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Slips, or Off-Sets, which every plant of them uſually ſhoots out every year in the Spring, round about its old Root, and which muſt be taken off as ſoon as they are grown big enough, leaving only at each place three of the beſt and furtheſt diſtant one from the other. For the planting them, we commonly make little Trenches, or Pits about half a foot deep, and three foot diſtant one from another, and filled with Mold, and we place two rows of them regulated by a line, in each Bed, which is to be full four foot broad, and parted from the next Bed by a path-way of one full foot; theſe Trenches of Pits are to be made at about half a foots diſtance from the edge of the Bed, and Checquerwiſe one towards the other; we place two Slips in a right Line in each ſpace containing between Nine and Ten Inches in Length. We muſt renew them once every three years at leaſt, cut off their Leaves at the beginning of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cover them with long dry dung during all the very cold weather till the end of <hi>March,</hi> when we muſt uncover them, and ſlip them, if their Slips be yet big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or elſe ſtay three Weeks or a Month longer till they be, then we muſt labour and move the Earth well about them, and dung them with the rotteneſt part of that Dung that ſerved them for a covering; we water them moderately once or twice a Week, till about the end of <hi>May,</hi> their Fruit begins to appear, and from that time we muſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them plentifully, that is two or three times a Week, during the whole Summer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing half a Pitcher full of Water to each plant, and eſpecially in Grounds naturally dry; thoſe planted in the Spring, ſhould bring their Fruit to perfection in Autumn fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, if well watered, and they which do not, ought to yield their firſt Fruit in the next Spring after, in caſe they be ſtrong enough to reſiſt the ſharpneſs of the Winter. <hi>Artichokes</hi> have not only the hard weather, and exceſs of wet to fear, but they have the Field Mice likewiſe for their Enemies, thoſe miſchievous little Animals gnawing their Roots in the Winter-time, when they find nothing better in the Gardens, and for that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48210:219"/>
reaſon, it's good to plant one Rank of <hi>Beet-Chards</hi> between two Ranks of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> that the Field-Mice finding the Roots of theſe laſt the tendrer of the two, may fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them inſtead of the others, as they never fail to do. There are three ſorts of <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, viz.</hi> the green, or otherwiſe white ones, which are the moſt early, the violet ones, whoſe Fruit is almoſt of a pyramidal Figure, and the red ones which are round, and flat like the white ones. The two laſt ſorts are the moſt delicious.</p>

                                 <hi>Aſparagus</hi> are ſown at the beginning of the Spring like other Seeds, that is, they are ſown in ſome Bed well prepared; they muſt be ſown indifferent thin, and raked with an Iron Rake, to cover them with Earth. About a year after, if they be big enough, as they will be, if the Ground be good, and well prepared; or if not, at leaſt at two years end, we muſt tranplant them, which is to be done about the end of <hi>March,</hi> and all the Month of <hi>April;</hi> and for that effect we muſt have Beds between three and four foot broad, and ſeparated one from the other; if it be in ordinary Ground, we dig theſe Beds hollow with a good Spade, throwing up the Earth we take out of them upon the Path-ways; and as to ſtrong, heavy and moiſt Grounds, I would have them ordered as I have done the <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> that is to ſay, I would not have the Beds in them at all laid hollow, but on the contrary, raiſed and kept higher than the Path-ways, too much wet being mortal to theſe Plants. <hi>Aſparagus</hi> thus ſown ſhoot out Tufts of Roots round about their Eye, or Mother Root; that is to ſay, round the place from whence all their ſhoots are to Spring, which Roots ſpread between two Earths, and in order to tranſplant them either into a hollow Bed, or a high raiſed Bed, we beſtow a good tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Tillage on the bottom of the Trench, and if the Ground be not very good, we dung it a little, and afterward we plant two or three ſtocks of theſe young Plants, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in ranks upon the Super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>icies of the Bed prepared for them, without needing to trim the extremity of their Roots, or at leaſt, but a very little, and if our intention be, to force theſe <hi>Aſparagus</hi> by an artificial heat, when they are grown big enough, we place them at a foot diſtance one from the other, and if they be to remain to grow after the uſual manner, we allow them at a foot and a half's diſtance, but in both Caſes, we place them Checquerwiſe, and when they are ſo placed, we cover them up again with two or three Inches depth of Earth: if any of them fail to Spring up, we may reimplace them with new ones two or three Months after, which is to be done in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we planted the others, only taking care to water the new planted ones ſometimes during the great heat, and to keep them always well weeded, and well dug about, or elſe we mark out with little ſticks the empty places, and ſtay till the Spring before we fill them up again. Every year we cover the Bed with a little Earth taken off from the Path-way, becauſe inſtead of ſinking, they always are riſing by little and little: we dung them moderately every two years, and let them ſhoot up the firſt three or four years without gathering any, till we ſee them begin to grow pretty thick, and then we may force as many as we pleaſe of them, or if not, we continue to gather of them every year a crop for fifteen years, before we need to renew them. Every year about <hi>Martle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> we cut down all their ſtems, every ſtock producing ſeveral ſtems, and take the ſeed of the faireſt of them for Seed, if we would have them come to bear at the time above-mentioned. To draw them out of their <hi>Nurſery-Beds,</hi> we uſe an Iron Fork, the <hi>Spade</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too dangerous for that work, becauſe it would cut, and hurt thoſe little Plants.</p>
                              <p>We muſt not fail every Year at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> that is, before the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> begin to ſprout naturally, to beſtow a ſmall dreſſing or ſtirring of the Ground about three or four Inches deep, on every Bed, taking care not to let the <hi>Spade</hi> go ſo deep, as to hurt the Plants; which ſmall dreſſing ſerves, both to kill the Weeds and to render the Superficies of the Earth looſe, and thereby not only the better to diſpoſe it to drink up the Rain, and the <hi>May-dew</hi> that nouriſhes the Stocks, but likewiſe to facilitate the paſſage of the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> in ſprouting. The particular and moſt dreadful Enemies of <hi>Aſparagus</hi> are a ſort of little Fleas, that faſten upon their ſhoots, make them miſcarry, and hinder them from thriving; they are moſt troubleſome in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot and dry years, not appearing at all in other years; there has been no Remedy found yet againſt this miſchief.</p>

                                 <hi>Bete-raves,</hi> or <hi>Red Beet-Roots,</hi> are annual Plants propagated only by Seed, and are ſeldom tranſplanted. They are ſown in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> either in <hi>Beds</hi> or Borders. They muſt be ſown very thin, or at leaſt if they come up too thick they muſt be very much thinned, or elſe they will not grow ſo fair and large as they ſhould be. They require a very good, and well prepared Ground: They are the beſt that have the <hi>Reddeſt</hi> ſubſtance and the <hi>Reddeſt</hi> Tops: They are not good to ſpend till towards the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and all the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon. To have Seed of them, we tranſplant in <hi>March</hi> ſome of the laſt years Roots that we have preſerved from the <hi>Froſt,</hi> their Seed is gathered in the Months of <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September.</hi>

We ſow of them ſeveral times in the ſame <hi>Summer,</hi> becauſe their Leaves, in which conſiſts all their excellence, are good only whilſt they are tender, that is, while they are young. Their little <hi>Violet Colour'd Flowers</hi> ſerve to adorn <hi>Sallets.</hi> Their Seed falls aſſoon as 'tis ripe, and therefore muſt be carefully watch'd: The ſureſt way is to cut down the ſtalks, and lay them a drying in the <hi>Sun,</hi> aſſoon as ever the Seeds begin to ripen, and by that means we ſhall loſe but very few.</p>

My practice is in all ſorts of <hi>Vines,</hi> but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the <hi>Muſcat</hi> or <hi>Musked</hi> ſorts, to keep the lower Branches ſhorter by two buds, than the higheſt, to keep the Plant always low, when I would not have them mount up upon a Trail.</p>

                                 <hi>CAbbages</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Kitchen-Plants</hi> take Root again the eaſilieſt when tranſplanted, as they are likewiſe the moſt known, and moſt uſed of any in our whole <hi>Gardens.</hi> They are multiplied by Seed, and are of ſeveral ſorts and Seaſons. There are ſome called <hi>White,</hi> or headed <hi>Cabbages,</hi> which are for the ſervice of the latter end of <hi>Summer,</hi> and for <hi>Autumn.</hi> There are ſome Curled, called <hi>Pancaliers,</hi> and <hi>Milan Cabbages,</hi> which produce ſmall headed <hi>Cabbages,</hi> for <hi>Winter;</hi> there are ſome of a <hi>Red</hi> or <hi>Violet Colour;</hi> and ſome called long ſided <hi>Cabbages,</hi> whereof ſome are Bright or <hi>White,</hi> and very delicate, ripe in <hi>Vintage</hi> time, and others <hi>Green,</hi> and are not very good till they be <hi>Froſt-</hi>bitten. Laſtly, there are ſome called <hi>Choux Fleurs,</hi> i. e. <hi>Cabbage Flowers,</hi> and by the Engliſh <hi>Collyflowers,</hi> which are the moſt noble and valuable of them all, and are not uſed in pottage, but in choice intermeſſes; they cannot endure the <hi>Froſt,</hi> and therefore aſſoon as they begin to form their heads, they muſt be covered with their Leaves tied up for that end over them, with Straw bands, to guard them from the inſults of the Cold that ſpoil and rot them. They are for our <hi>Winter</hi> ſpending, and muſt be ſheltred in the <hi>Green</hi> houſe or <hi>Conſervatory,</hi> whither they muſt be carried and there planted with a turf of their old Earth, about them, where they commonly are uſed to perfect the full growth of their heads. All other <hi>Cabbage-Plants</hi> yield Seed in <hi>France,</hi> but only theſe, whoſe Seed we are fain to have brought up from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, which makes them ordinarily very dear. To make <hi>Cabbages</hi> run to Seed, we uſe every year either in <hi>Autumn</hi> or <hi>Spring</hi> to tranſplant ſome of the beſt and faireſt of them, which run to Seed in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> that is gathered in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

                              <p>You are by the way to remark two things; The firſt is, that all thick Plants that run to Seed, and grow pretty high, as <hi>Cabbage, Leeks, Ciboules, Onions, Red Beet-Roots, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, Parſnips, Cellery,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be ſupported either with upright props, or cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>s ſticks, to hinder the wind from breaking down their ſtems before the Seed be Ripe.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond is, that we ſeldom ſtay to let any Seeds dry upon their Plants as they ſtand, it being enough to let them only Ripen, when we cut down their ſtems, and lay them to dry upon ſome Cloth, after which, we beat them out, and fan and cleanſe them and lay them up when they are fully dry: And thus we do with the Seeds of <hi>Creſſes, Chervil, Parſley, Radiſhes, Borage, Bugloſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Ordinary <hi>Capers</hi> grow upon a ſort of ſmall Shrub that is raiſed in niches made purpoſely in well expoſed Walls, for that end, which are filled with Earth to nouriſh the Plants; and every year in the <hi>Spring</hi> we prune their Branches, which afterwards ſhoot out buttons or ſwelling buds, which are pickled up in Vinegar to be uſed in <hi>Winter,</hi> either in <hi>Sallets,</hi> or in pottage.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Capucine-Capers,</hi> or <hi>Naſturces,</hi> are annual Plants which are uſually ſown in <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and tranſplanted again in the naked Earth along by ſome Walls, or at the foot of ſome <hi>Trees,</hi> where their mounting ſtalks which are but weak, and grow pretty high may take ſome hold, to ſupport themſelves. They are alſo planted in Pots, and Boxes, in which ſome ſticks are ſet up to ſupport their ſtalks. Their Buttons or round Buds before they open, are good to pickle in Vinegar. Their <hi>Flower</hi> is pretty large of an <hi>Orange Colour,</hi> and very agreeable. They muſt be carefully watered in the <hi>Summer,</hi> to make them ſhoot vigorouſly, and ſo long time as they ſhould. Their Seed falls to the Earth aſſoon as ever 'tis ripe, as well as that of <hi>Borage</hi> and <hi>Bugloſs,</hi> and therefore muſt be carefully gathered up.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Caprons,</hi> are a ſort of large <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> not over delicate, which ripen at the ſame time as thoſe of the better kind. Their Leaves are extraordinary large, velveted and of a darkiſh <hi>Green Colour.</hi> They are little to be prized, and are found in the Woods as other <hi>Straw-berries</hi> are.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Spaniſh Cardons</hi> or <hi>Cardoons,</hi> grow only from Seed. They are ſown at two ſeveral times.</p>
                              <p>The firſt is commonly about the middle, or latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the ſecond, at the beginning of <hi>May.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>They muſt be ſown in good and well prepared Ground, and in little Trenches or pits a full foot wide, and about ſix Inches deep, filled with Mold. We make <hi>Beds</hi> of four or five foot wide, in order to place in them two ranks of thoſe little Trenches or pits checker-wiſe. We put five or ſix Seeds in every hole, with intention to let but two or three of them grow, if they all come up, taking away thoſe that are over and above that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48210:221"/>
number, either to throw away, or to new ſtock thoſe places where there perhaps are none come up, or where we may have ſown ſome few upon a <hi>Hot Bed</hi> for that intention. And if in fifteen or twenty days we do not ſee the Seed come up, we ſhould uncover them, to ſee whether they be rotten, or begin to ſprour, that ſo we may fill up their places with new ones in caſe of need. The Seeds of the firſt ſowing are generally three weeks coming up, and thoſe of the ſecond fifteen days. <hi>Cardons</hi> muſt not be ſown before the middle of <hi>April,</hi> for fear they ſhould grow too big, and run to Seed in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and then they are not good. Great care muſt be taken to water them well; and when towards the end of <hi>October,</hi> we have a mind to whiten them, we take the advantage of ſome dry day, firſt to tie up all their Leaves with two or three bands, and ſome days after, we cover them quite up with Straw or dry Litter well twiſted about them, ſo that the Air may not penetrate to come at them, except it be at the very top, which we leave open.</p>
                              <p>Theſe <hi>Cardoon</hi> Plants thus wrapt up, whiten in about fifteen days or three weeks, and grow fit to Eat. We make an end of tying up, and wrapping, or covering all that we have in our <hi>Gardens,</hi> when we perceive the <hi>Winter</hi> approach, and then we take them up with the Earth about them, to tranſplant them in our <hi>Green</hi> Houſe, or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory:</hi> Some of thoſe Plants are good to tranſplant in the naked Earth in the following <hi>Spring,</hi> to run to Seed in <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> or elſe ſome Plants of them tied up in their firſt places, will ſerve for that three or four times together.</p>

                                 <hi>Carrots</hi> are a ſort of Root, whereof ſome are <hi>White,</hi> and others <hi>Yellow,</hi> that grow only from Seed, and require the ſame care and ordering which we have already deſcribed under the head of <hi>Red Beet-Roots.</hi>

                                 <hi>Cellery,</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Sallet</hi> produced by Seed, and is not good but at the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and during the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon. We ſow of it two ſeveral times, to be ſupplied with it ſo much the longer, becauſe that which has been long ſown, eaſily runs to Seed, and grows hard. We ſow it then the firſt time upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and becauſe its Seed is ſo extream ſmall, we cannot help ſowing it too thick, ſo that if we be not careful to thin it, and crop it in time, to make it grow to ſome ſtrength and bigneſs before we tranſplant it, it warps and flags its head too much, and grows weak, and ſhoots its Leaves ſtraglingly outward, inſtead of producing ſtore of them from the middle of its ſtock. The ſureſt way is to tranſplant it in a <hi>Nurſery Bed,</hi> placing the Plants two or three Inches one from another, for which we make holes with our fingers only; we tranſplant that which comes of the firſt ſowing at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> and ſow our ſecond ſowing, at the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June,</hi> but 'tis in open <hi>Beds,</hi> and we take the ſame care to thin, crop, and tranſplant this, as we did that of the firſt ſowing, but we muſt plant more of it the ſecond time, than at the firſt. There are two ways of tranſplanting it; the one is in a Pit or Trench one full ſpit deep, and between three and four foot broad, in order to place in it three or four ranks of theſe Plants at the diſtance of one foot from one another: This way of making hollow <hi>Beds</hi> Earth up our <hi>Cellery</hi> in, is good only in dry Grounds, wet ones being too apt to rot, it. The ſecond way of tranſplanting it, is in plain <hi>Beds</hi> that are not made hollow, and at the ſame diſtances as in the other, taking care in both ſorts of <hi>Beds</hi> to water them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in <hi>Summer</hi> time, its chief goodneſs conſiſting in being tender, as well as in being very <hi>White.</hi> Watering contributes to the firſt kind of goodneſs, and for the ſecond, you are to obſerve, that to <hi>Whiten Cellery,</hi> we begin at firſt to tie it with two bands when it is big enough, chuſing dry weather for that effect, and afterward we Earth our <hi>Cellery</hi> Plants quite up, with Earth taken off the high raiſed path-ways, or elſe cover it all over with a good quantity of long dry Dung, or dry Leaves, as we do <hi>Cardoons. Cellery</hi> ſo Earthed up with dry Earth, or Clothed with long dry Dung, or dry Leaves, to the very top of its Leaves, <hi>Whitens</hi> in three weeks or a Month, and becauſe when 'tis <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> it rots as it ſtands, if it be not preſently eaten, by conſequence, we are not to Earth it up, or cover it with Dung, but in ſuch proportion as we are able to ſpend out of hand; there needs no other precaution to be uſed to it ſo long as it does not freeze; but as ſoon as ever it begins to ſet to freeze, we muſt then cover up our <hi>Cellery</hi> quite over head and ears, for a hard <hi>Froſt</hi> ſpoils it preſently. And that we may the more eaſily cover it, after we have firſt tied it up with two or three bands, we take it up with the Earth about it, at the beginning of <hi>Winter,</hi> and plant it in another <hi>Bed,</hi> ſetting the Plants as cloſe as we can one to another, and then there needs much leſs ſtuff to cover them, than when they are left ſtanding in their old places at ſuch great diſtances aſunder. The way to raiſe Seed from them, is, to tranſplant ſome Plants of them in ſome by-place, after <hi>Winter</hi> is paſt, which will not fail to run to Seed in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we know but one ſort of it.</p>

                                 <hi>Chards</hi> of <hi>Artichokes,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Coſtons,</hi> are the Leaves of fair <hi>Artichoke</hi> Plants tied, and wrapt up with Straw in Autumn and Winter, which being covered up all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but at their very top, with Straw, grow white, and by that means, loſe a little of their bitterneſs, ſo that when they are boiled, they are ſerved up like true <hi>Spaniſh Cardons,</hi> but after all, are not ſo good, and beſides the Plants often rot and periſh whilſt we are whiting them.</p>

                                 <hi>Chard-Beets</hi> are Plants of white <hi>Beets</hi> tranſplanted in a well prepared Bed, at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a full foot one from the other, which produce great Tops, that in the middle have a large white, and thick downy Cotton-like Main ſhoot, and that downy Cotton-like ſhoot is the true <hi>Chard</hi> uſed in Pottages and Intermeſſes. After we have ſown white <hi>Beets</hi> upon <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> or in the naked Earth, in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> we tranſplant that which is yelloweſt in <hi>Beds</hi> purpoſely prepared, and by taking care to water them well during the Summer, they grow big and ſtrong enough to reſiſt the hard winter cold, provided care be taken to cover them with long dry Dung, juſt as we do <hi>Artichokes.</hi> They are likewiſe well placed, when two Ranks of them are tranſplanted between two Ranks of <hi>Artichokes.</hi> We uncover them in <hi>April,</hi> and dreſs the Earth about them, and give them careful attendance, and by the means of this diligent Culture, they produce thoſe fine <hi>Chards</hi> we have in the <hi>Rogation</hi> Seaſon, and in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> in fine, they run to Seed, which we gather in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to ſow in the following Spring.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Chaſſela's</hi> is a very good and ſweet ſort of Grape, of which there are two kinds, white and Red, and this latter is very ſcarce and rare, but the other very common. It requires the good Expoſitions of the <hi>South, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> to be ſo much the yellower, the more firm and crackling, the better; It is of all Grapes that which keeps lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, if it be not ſuffered to grow too ripe upon the Vine before it be gathered. Its Culture which conſiſts in pruning it, is the ſame with that of the <hi>Bourdelais</hi> or Verjuice Grape.</p>
                              <p>Musked <hi>Chervil</hi> is one of our Sallet-Furnitures, and at the beginning of the Spring, whilſt its Leaves are young and tender, it is agreeable, and proper to contribute towards the giving a perfuming Reliſh, but they are to be uſed no longer when they are old and tough. It remains ſeveral Years in its place without being ſpoiled by the Froſt, ſo that its Stock grows pretty big and high: it runs to Seed towards the Month of <hi>June,</hi> and by that is multiplyed.</p>
                              <p>Ordinary <hi>Chervil</hi> is an annual Plant, or rather a plant of few Months, which ſerves for many Uſes, and eſpecially in Sallets, when it is young and tender, and therefore we ought to ſee a little of it every Month proportionably to the occaſions we have for it, and to the quantity of Ground we have. It runs very eaſily to Seed, and if we have ſome of it betimes, we muſt ſow it about the end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and doubtleſs we ſhall have the Seed quite ripe towards the middle of <hi>June</hi> following; we cut down the ſtalks as ſoon as it begins to grow yellow, and beat it out as we do that of other Plants.</p>

We thin our <hi>Cibouls</hi> alſo for the ſame, and we tranſplant ſome which proſper very well, and grow big when they are ſo tranſplanted.

We keep of them in our ſtore-houſes, till about the middle of <hi>Lent,</hi> when they have been ſeaſonably gather'd, and well defended from the <hi>Cold:</hi> All ſorts of ſituation in the open Air agree with them well enough, but yet they which are well expoſed ripen ſooner than the others; we trim nothing off from them, but only content our ſelves with watering them ſometimes when the <hi>Summers</hi> are exceſſive dry.

                                 <hi>ENdive</hi> is a ſort of very good annual Plant uſed in <hi>Sallets,</hi> and in our pottage in the <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſons, provided it be well whitened, and conſequently tender and delicate; it is multiplied only by Seed. There is the Common or <hi>Garden Endive,</hi> and wild <hi>Endive,</hi> called alſo <hi>Succory,</hi> the common name in <hi>French</hi> to them both. The Common <hi>Endive</hi> is of ſeveral kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>White,</hi> which is the moſt delicate, and the <hi>Green</hi> ſort which is the moſt ruſtical, and beſt able to reſiſt the <hi>Cold,</hi> as likewiſe the Curled ſort, and that which is not Curled.</p>
                              <p>All ſorts of them agree tolerably well with all kinds of Ground. We ſeldom begin to ſow any of them till towards the middle of <hi>May,</hi> and then they muſt be ſown very thin, or be very much thinned, aftewards in order to be whitened in the places where they firſt grow, without tranſplanting, and we alſo ſow but a little quantity of them at once, becauſe they are too apt to run to Seed: The ſeaſon for ſowing a greater quantity of them is at the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> and during the whole Month of <hi>July,</hi> in order to have ſome good for ſpending in <hi>September,</hi> and we afterwards ſow a great deal of it again in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that we may have a ſufficient proviſion of it to ſupply us all the reſt of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and the firſt part of the <hi>Winter.</hi> When our <hi>Endive</hi> comes up too thick, we cut it, or elſe pull up ſome of it, to thin it, that the reſt may grow big enough to be tranſplanted; and when we tranſplant any of it in <hi>Summer</hi> time, it muſt be placed at the diſtance of a large foot between Plant and Plant; we uſually make great <hi>Beds</hi> of five or ſix foot broad, in order to tranſplant them afterwards in rows markt out ſtrait with a cord. This Plant requires great and frequent waterings; and when 'tis big enough we muſt go to work to whiten it, for which effect, we tie it up with two or three bands according as its height requires; and being ſo tied, it whitens in fifteen, or twenty days: But becauſe it is very apprehenſive of the <hi>Froſt,</hi> therefore aſſoon as ever the <hi>Cold</hi> begins to come on, we cover it with long dry Dung, whether it be tied up or no: At the end of <hi>September,</hi> we plant the ſtocks of it pretty near together becauſe then it grows neither ſo high, nor ſpreads ſo much as in <hi>Summer:</hi> And if we can ſave any Plants of it in <hi>Winter,</hi> we muſt tranſplant them again in the <hi>Spring</hi> in order to produce Seed that may have ſufficient time to ripen. Thoſe perſons that have a good <hi>Conſervatory</hi> or <hi>Green</hi> houſe, will do well to houſe it up there, but they which have none muſt be content to cover it up well with a good quantity of long dry Dung, ſo that the <hi>Froſt</hi> may not come at it.</p>
                              <p>Wild <hi>Endive,</hi> or <hi>Succory</hi> is ſown at the very beginning of the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and that pretty thick, and in Ground well prepared. We endeavour to fortifie it, and make it grow big all <hi>Summer,</hi> by watering, and cropping it that it may be fit to whiten in <hi>Winter.</hi>

                              <p>There are ſome People that will eat it <hi>Green</hi> in <hi>Sallets</hi> though it be never ſo bitter, but commonly they rather deſire it whitened: And to whiten it, we cover it up with a great deal of long Dung, after we have firſt cut it cloſe to the Earth, by which means, it been forced to ſpring up in obſcurity, and ſhaded from all light, its young ſhoots grow <hi>White</hi> and tender. The neateſt way is by the interpoſition of ſome props croſſing from ſide to ſide, to keep the Dung from touching it, ſince it ſhoots up in the ſame manner under ſuch a hollow covering as under a cloſe one, ſo that care be taken, ſo well to ſtop up paſſages on all ſides, that no light or Air at all get in. Being thus ordered, its ſhoots are much cleanlier, and reliſh not ſo much of the Dung. They which have <hi>Conſervatories</hi> may tranſplant ſome of it thither in <hi>Winter,</hi> it ſprouting well enough there, when it is but a little obſcurely placed. When it is <hi>Green</hi> it endures the <hi>Froſt</hi> well enough, and at the very latter end of <hi>May,</hi> it runs to Seed. Many People eat its young ſhoots in <hi>Sallets</hi> when they are young and tender.</p>

We may leave ſome of them ſtanding after <hi>Winter,</hi> to run to Seed, or elſe we may Plant ſome in a ſeparate place for that purpoſe. Their Seed is gathered in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and there is one ſort that is bigger than the ordinary one, which is the beſt.</p>

                                 <hi>Lettuces</hi> are Plants that are the moſt ordinarily and commonly ſeen in our <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> and are indeed the moſt uſeful <hi>Manna</hi> of them, and eſpecially for <hi>Sallets,</hi> of which almoſt all the World is moſt conſtantly amorous. We have many things; for in the firſt place, there are <hi>Lettuces</hi> of different Seaſons, thoſe which are good in certain Months in the year being not good in others; and thoſe which grow well in the <hi>Spring,</hi> thriving not well in <hi>Summer;</hi> and they which proſper in <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> coming tonothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Spring</hi> nor <hi>Summer,</hi> as will be ſeen afterwards: In the ſecond place, there are ſome that with the ordinary help of the general culture attain their due perfection, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute both to the nouriſhment and pleaſure of Man-kind, and they are the <hi>Cabbage Lettuces.</hi>
                                 <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48210:223"/>
Thirdly, there are ſome that neceſſarily require the Art of Induſtry and the Gard'ner to advance them to that degree of perfection which they ſhould have; and they are ſuch as muſt be tied up to make them grow white, without which they would be neither tender, nor ſweet, nor good; ſuch as are the <hi>Roman Lettuces,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, and I have thought fit ſometimes to tie up thoſe that were to cabbage, when I ſaw they did not cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage ſoon enough, by which means they may be forced to cabbage whether they will or no. I uſe this Method particularly with ſome ſorts of <hi>Winter Lettuces,</hi> that is, when there are any of them which though furniſhed with leaves big enough to cabbage, yet for want of ſufficient heat, are hindred from turning, that is from growing hard; and this expedient is a very ſoveraign Remedy againſt that Defect, in a ſurly Seaſon; and beſides theſe general diſtinctions, the number of the particular Kinds of <hi>Lettuces</hi> is greater than of any other ſort of <hi>Kitchen-plants</hi> whatſoever, as will appear more eſpecially by the order they obſerve in reſpect of the Seaſons; and the order of the <hi>Cabbage-Lettuces,</hi> as near as I can deſcribe it, is this.</p>
                              <p>The firſt that cabbage at the going out of Winter, are the <hi>Shell Lettuces</hi> ſo call'd, becauſe their Leaf is round almoſt like a Shell. They are otherwiſe called <hi>Winter-Lettu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> becauſe they pretty well indure ordinary Froſts, which none of all the other <hi>Lettu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> can do. Theſe are ſown in <hi>September,</hi> and afterward tranſplanted in ſome <hi>Wall-Border</hi> towards the South and Eaſt, in the Months of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> or elſe they are ſown upon <hi>Hot Beds</hi> under <hi>Bells,</hi> in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and are good to eat in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May.</hi> We have at the ſame time another ſort of <hi>Reddiſh Lettuces</hi> called <hi>Paſſion Lettuces,</hi> which proſper very well in light Grounds, but not over well in others that being colder and ſtronger or heavier, eaſily infect them with ſlimy Snivel. Both theſe kinds ſhould when they thrive, produce very thick and good Heads. To theſe ſucceed the Bright curled <hi>Lettuces,</hi> which uſually cabbage in the Spring, that is before the heat grows any thing exceſſive, but they muſt not be planted in ſtrong and heavy Lands. They likewiſe do well enough upon a <hi>Hot Bed,</hi> and eſpecially under <hi>Glaſs Bells</hi> or <hi>Frames;</hi> for when they are ſown in <hi>January,</hi> and tranſplanted as ſoon as they are grown any thing thick, or elſe left thin upon their <hi>Nurſery-Beds,</hi> they cabbage as ſoon as the <hi>Winter-Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces,</hi> and are very excellent.</p>
                              <p>There is about the ſame Seaſon, two other ſorts of <hi>Curled Bright Lettuces;</hi> viz. one called <hi>George Lettuces,</hi> which are thicker and leſs curled than the ordinary <hi>Curled Bright Lettuces;</hi> and another called the <hi>Minion Lettuce,</hi> which is the leaſt ſort. Both theſe laſt require ſuch Ground as we term good black Sand, but yet their Heads ſeldom cabbage cloſe enough, that is to ſay, are not ordinarily ſo hard and firm as thoſe of the right <hi>Curled Bright Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Curled Green Lettuces</hi> come in near about the ſame Seaſon with the preceeding ones, but are not ſo tender nor delicate.</p>
                              <p>There is alſo a ſort of ſmall red ones, and another named <hi>Short Lettuces,</hi> both which have all the neceſſary qualifications of good <hi>Lettuces,</hi> excepting only that their Heads are ſmall, and that they likewiſe require Black Sandy Ground.</p>
                              <p>The firſt <hi>Lettuces</hi> ſupply us amply as I have ſaid, during the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> but after that time they are too apt to be influenced to run to Seed by the great heat that then comes on. They are followed during the reſt of <hi>June,</hi> and all the Month of <hi>July,</hi> by thoſe called the <hi>Royal Bellegardes,</hi> or <hi>Fair Looks, Bright Genua's, Capucins, Aubervilliers,</hi> and <hi>Perpignans;</hi> of which laſt, there are both green and bright, both of which produce very fair and very good heads, and thrive well enough in ſtrong Grounds too, when the Summer proves not too Rainy; but cold, or too frequent Rains infect them with Slime and Snivel, and conſequently deſtroy them. The <hi>Capucin Lettuces</hi> are reddiſh, cabbage eaſily, even without tranſplanting, and are pretty delicate. The <hi>Aubervilliers</hi> bring forth Heads that are too hard, and ſometimes bitter withall, and are more uſed for boiling than for Sallets. The difference that appears between the <hi>Royal</hi> and the <hi>Bellegardes</hi> or <hi>Fair look'd Lettuces,</hi> is only, that the former are a little more Greeniſh, and theſe laſt a little Brighter.</p>
                              <p>However in the Summer time, the tied <hi>Lettuces</hi> are mixed among the cabbaged ones, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman Lettuces</hi> which are open, and are called <hi>Chicons,</hi> or <hi>Bright,</hi> and are termed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanges,</hi> which laſt are more delicate than the <hi>Chicons,</hi> both to raiſe, and when they are eaten in <hi>Sallets.</hi> There are alſo a ſort which are ſtiled <hi>Imperial Lettuces,</hi> which are of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great Size, and are likewiſe very delicate to the taſte, but very apt to rot as ſoon as ever they grow white; there are beſides, a certain kind of large <hi>Reddiſh Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                                    </gap>s,</hi> which whiten in a manner of themſelves without tying, and are good in courſe Grounds, and ſucceed uſually pretty well in Summer, for as for the green <hi>Chicons,</hi> we
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48210:224"/>
cannot well have them but in the Spring, becauſe they run too haſtily to Seed. The <hi>Lettuces</hi> that defend themſelves beſt from the great heat that predominates about the end of <hi>July,</hi> and all the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> are thoſe we call <hi>Genua Lettuces,</hi> and eſpecially the green ſort, for the <hi>Bright Genua,</hi> and <hi>Red Genua</hi> run more eaſily to Seed, and will hardly come to good but in light Grounds. We ſhould therefore prepare a great many of theſe green <hi>Genua's</hi> againſt the Dog-days, and the firſt Froſts; we may alſo intermix with them ſome few <hi>Bright,</hi> and ſome <hi>Red Genua's;</hi> but more eſpecially we ſhould be ſure to mix with them ſome <hi>Alfanges,</hi> and a great quantity of bright or white <hi>Endive,</hi> as likewiſe, a great many <hi>Perpignan Lettuces,</hi> both of the bright and green kind. The great Inconveniencies that happen to <hi>Cabbage Lettuces,</hi> are firſt, that they often degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſo far as to cabbage no more, which is diſcovered by their Leaves growing out in length like a Cat's Tongue, as Gard'ners term it, or by their changing their natural colour into another more or leſs green; and therefore we muſt be very careful to gather no Seed from any but ſuch as cabbage very well, for which effect, we ſhould be ſure to mark out at firſt, ſome of thoſe that turn beſt, in order to reſerve them to run to Seed where they ſtand, or to remove them with a turf of the Earth about them into ſome ſeparate place aſſigned for that purpoſe.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond is, that as ſoon as the moſt part of them are cabbaged, they muſt be ſpent, unleſs we would have the diſpleaſure to ſee them run to Seed without doing us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Service; in which Reſpect the Market Gard'ners have a great advantage beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, becauſe they can ſell off in one day, whole Beds of theſe <hi>Cabbage Lettuces,</hi> for commonly the Beds which were new planted at the ſame time, <hi>Cabbage</hi> likewiſe all at once, whereas in other Gardens, we cannot ſpend them any faſter than we need them, for which Reaſon we are obliged to plant often of them, and that in greater quantity than we are able to conſume, that we may have a continual ſupply of them ſucceſſively, without any Diſcontinuation, it being much more commodious to have an over-plus quantity of them, than to want. The ſureſt way is to keep particularly to thoſe ſorts that are the moſt Ruſtical, and that laſt a great while cabbaged before they run to Seed, ſuch as are the <hi>Shell Lettuces,</hi> the <hi>Perpignans,</hi> the <hi>Green Genua's,</hi> the <hi>Aubervilliers,</hi> and the <hi>Auſtrichettes,</hi> or <hi>Auſtrian Lettuces,</hi> which I muſt confeſs too, are a long time cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baging.</p>
                              <p>The third inconvenience is, that the <hi>Morie,</hi> that is, the Rot which begins at the ends of their Leaves, ſeizes them ſometimes, and that when the Ground or the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are not favourable to them, they remain thin and lean, and run up to Seed inſtead of ſpreading and cabbaging. There is hardly any Remedy to prevent this Rot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is hardly any to be found effectual againſt the cold and rainy Seaſons that cauſe it; but againſt the defects that may be in the Ground, there are infallible ones, that is to ſay, it muſt be amended and improved with ſmall Dung, if it be barren, whether it be a ſandy, or a <hi>Cold</hi> and groſs Earth; and to this laſt, we ſhould give a little ſlope, if when the Ground is good, the waters ſpoil it by ſettling too much in it, and by that means, make all the Plants growing there to rot. Good Dung throughly rotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul and <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of <hi>Kitchen-Gardens,</hi> without which, no more than without frequent waterings, and dreſſing of the Ground no man can ever be rich in fine and goodly <hi>Legumes.</hi>

                              <p>There yet remains to be known for the perfect underſtanding the ordering of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces,</hi> that they which grow biggeſt muſt be placed ten or twelve inches one from the other, which is to be underſtood of the <hi>Shell Lettuces, Perpignans, Auſtrians, Bellegardes,</hi> or <hi>Fair-looks, Aubervilliers, Alfanges,</hi> and <hi>Imperials;</hi> and for thoſe that bear heads but of a midling ſize, the diſtance of ſeven or eight inches is enough, which are the Bright Curled, the ſhort, the little <hi>Red,</hi> and the <hi>Green Chicon Lettuces,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe that will be good husbands may ſow <hi>Radiſhes</hi> in their <hi>Lettuce Beds,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Radiſhes</hi> will be all drawn out and ſpent before the <hi>Lettuces</hi> cabbage; and for the ſame reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Endives</hi> are much longer before they come to perfection than the <hi>Lettuces,</hi> we may Plant ſome of theſe laſt among the <hi>Endives;</hi> they agree well enough one with the other: and ſo we may have a double crop to gather upon one and the ſame <hi>Bed</hi> and in the ſame Seaſon; for the <hi>Lettuces</hi> are gathered firſt, and afterwards the <hi>Endives</hi> arrive to their full good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                                 <hi>Muſcats</hi> are a kind of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which when they attain to their natural goodneſs, are one of the moſt conſiderable commodities of a <hi>Kitchen-Garden.</hi> There are three ſorts of them, <hi>viz.</hi> White, Red, and Black, the White is commonly the beſt of the three, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires temperate Countries like that of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the Expoſitions of the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and always a light Ground, we ſeldom ſee any good ones in pure Earth, and if it be in hot Climates, or Gravelly, and Sandy Ground; they proſper very well upon Counter-Eſpaliers, or Pole Hedge-Trees, and even in the open Air. Their Goodneſs conſiſts in having large, yellow, and crackling Berries, and growing thin in their Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and in a pretty rich musked taſte, but yet not too ſtrong like the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ones.

                                 <hi>ONions</hi> are red or white, which laſt are ſweeter and more prized than the red ones. There's no Body but knows how many uſes they ſerve for. They are propagated only by Seed, which is commonly ſown at the latter end of <hi>February</hi> and beginning of <hi>March,</hi> in Beds of good Earth, and well prepared, and afterwards raked with an Iron Rake, to cover them, as is done to other ſmall Seeds. They muſt be ſown thin, that they may have room to grow to their full bigneſs, and therefore if they come up too thick, they muſt be thinned by pulling ſome of them up as ſoon as they are big enough for that, which is towards the Month of <hi>May,</hi> which we tranſplant in order to uſe inſtead of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouls.</hi> Though the ordinary Seaſon for ſowing <hi>Onions,</hi> be at the end of Winter, yet we
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48210:225"/>
mayſow ſome in <hi>September,</hi> and tranſplant them afterwards in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> by which means we may have ſome full grown at the very beginning of <hi>July,</hi> which we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, plucking them firſt out of the Ground as ſoon as that time comes, and then after we have dried them two or three days in the hot Sun, lay them up in ſome dry place, to keep all the year in caſe of need. We muſt not forget when our <hi>Onions</hi> begin to appear with pretty thick Stems above the Superficies of the Earth, that is, when they begin to advance towards their Maturity, to break them down, either by treading them under our Feet, or with a board pretty hard preſſed down upon them, becauſe by that means the nouriſhment that was before ſpent in their ſtems, being hindered from mounting upwards, will remain and ſettle all in that which I think, is but improperly called their head, and make it grow ſo much the bigger.

When its Leaves are cut, it ſhoots out new ones like Sorrel. It well enough reſiſts a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, but not a violent cold, and therefore 'tis beſt to beſtow ſome covering on it in Winter, to defend it. When we would have any of it produce large Roots, we muſt thin it in the Beds or Borders where 'tis ſown. It requires pretty much watering in very hot weather. There are ſome that pretend to have a kind of <hi>Parſly</hi> bigger than ordinary, but for my part I know no ſuch kind. The Curled <hi>Parſly</hi> appears more agreeable to the Sight, than the Common ſort, but is never a whit better than it for that.

We ſow it in the Spring, pretty thin, becauſe it produces a great many large Leaves, and we gather its Seed at the latter end of Summer.

But when they are propt, they yield more than when they are not. They require pretty good Ground, and a little Rain to make them tender and delicate, and muſt be ſown pretty thin. There are ſeveral ſorts of them, <hi>viz. Haſtings, Green, White</hi> and <hi>Square ones,</hi> otherwiſe called large codded <hi>Peas,</hi> &amp;c. We may have of them in the Months of <hi>May, June, July, Auguſt, September</hi> and <hi>October.</hi> For to have ſome all that while after the firſt, we have no more to do, but to ſow them in different Months, to have them fit for eating three Months after. Thoſe ſorts we are moſt choice of in <hi>Kitchen-Gardens</hi> are the <hi>Haſtings</hi> both White and Green, which are of a midling Size. We ſow them at the end of <hi>October,</hi> under the ſhelter of ſome <hi>Eaſtern</hi> or <hi>Southern</hi> Walls, and we raiſe Ridges or ſloped Banks too, ſometimes for that purpoſe; and to diſpoſe them to come up ſo much the ſooner when they are Sown, we make them Sprout five or ſix days before, by laying them to ſteep two days in Water, and afterwards laying them in a place where the cold cannot reach them, till their firſt Root begins to appear. Hard wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoils them quite, which is the reaſon why all we can do, will not procure us any good ones till the latter end of <hi>May.</hi> We likewiſe ſow ſome upon hot Beds, at the end of <hi>February,</hi> in order to tranſplant them by the ſides of ſome well expoſed Walls, in

                                 <hi>Purſlain</hi> is one of the prettieſt Plants in a <hi>Kitchen-gardens,</hi> which is principally uſed in <hi>Sallets,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>Pottages.</hi> There are two ſorts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Green,</hi> and the <hi>Red,</hi> or <hi>Golden;</hi> this latter is the more agreeable of the two to the Eye, and more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and difficult to rear, ſo that in hard weather we have much ado to make it grow even upon hot Beds, and under Bells, for it ſeldom proſpers in open Beds till about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> and then too, the Earth muſt be very good, ſweet, and very looſe, and the weather very fair. And therefore for our firſt <hi>Purſlain</hi> which we are not to begin to ſow upon hot Beds till towards the Middle of <hi>March,</hi> we muſt uſe only the Green ſort, becauſe the Yellow or Golden ſort dwindles away as ſoon as 'tis come up, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Seaſon be a little advanced, and the Sun a little hot, which is, towards the end of <hi>April.</hi> It is commonly ſown very thick, becauſe its Seed is ſo very ſmall, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſown thin. When we ſow it upon hot Beds, either when 'tis cold, and that by conſequence Glaſs-bells or Frames are needfull, or in milder Weather, we only preſs down the Mold about it with our hands, or with the back of a Spade; but when we ſow it in open Beds which muſt be well prepared for that purpoſe, we rake it over five or ſix times with an Iron Rake, to make the Seed enter into the Ground.</p>
                              <p>They way to raiſe Seed from it, is to tranſplant ſome Plants of it that are big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, into Beds well prepared, at the diſtance of eight or ten inches ones from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> are proper for that effect. And then in a little time after, they are run up, and have done flowring, aſſoon as ever we perceive any of their Husks to open, and diſcover ſome black Seed, we muſt cut down all their Stems and lay them ſome days in the Sun till all the Seed be quite ripened, and then we beat them out and winnow them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt be carefull to tranſplant each ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by it ſelf, that we may not be miſtaken in the Seed when we are to ſow it. The Stick Stalks of <hi>Purſlain</hi> that is run to Seed, are good to pickle in Salt and Vinegar, for Winter Sallets.</p>

                                 <hi>RAdiſhes,</hi> when they are qualified with all the goodneſs they ſhould have, that is, when they are tender, and ſnap eaſily, and are ſweet, are in my Opinion, one of the Plants that give the moſt pleaſure of any in our <hi>Kitchin-gardens,</hi> and that give it as often, and for as long a time as any of them all; and I look upon them as a kind of <hi>Manna</hi> in our Gardens. There ſeems to be no great pains required to make them grow, it being indeed only neceſſary to ſow them pretty thin, in well prepared looſe and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Earth, and to water them ſoundly in drie Weather, and with this culture they will attain to all the perfection they are capable of. But the main points here in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, are firſt, to be always provided with Seed of a good kind; and ſecondly, to take order to have <hi>Radiſhes</hi> without diſcontinuation, from the Month of <hi>February,</hi> till the coming in of the Froſts in the middle of <hi>November.</hi> As for Seed of a good kind, know, that is it that produces few Leaves, and a long red Root, for there are ſome that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a great many leaves and little Root; and when we are once provided with Seed of a good kind, we muſt be extreme carefull to propagate it, that we never be without a ſtock of it; for which effect, in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> we muſt chooſe out among thoſe <hi>Radiſhes</hi> that are come of the laſt years Seed, ſuch, as I have ſaid, which have the feweſt Leaves and the moſt Root, and reddeſt Necks, and tranſplant them quite whole in ſome well prepared ſpot of Ground, a foot and a half a ſunder: Being ſo tranſplanted, they will run up, flower and yield Seed ripe enough to gather towards the end of <hi>July;</hi> and then we cut down their ſtems; and after they have been dried ſome days in the Sun, we beat out the Seed, and winnow it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thoſe ſtocks of them that run up to Seed, ſhoot up their Branches to ſuch a height, and perpetuate their flowers ſo far as if they knew not where to ſtop; and therefore it is good to pinch off theſe Branches to a reaſonable length, that the firſt Podds may be the better nouriſhed.</p>
                              <p>But 'tis not enough to raiſe good Seed, we muſt likewiſe take order to be ſupplied with good <hi>Radiſhes</hi> for eight or nine Months in the year. The firſt that are eaten grow on Hot-beds, the manner of raiſing which, I have explained in the Works of <hi>November;</hi> and by the means of thoſe <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> we may have ſome during the Months of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48210:226"/>
March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> otherwiſe we have none; and in order to have ſome all the other Months, we muſt ſow ſome among all manner of Seeds, they coming up ſo very quickly, that we have time to gather off our <hi>Radiſhes</hi> before they can do any harm to the other Plants. <hi>Radiſhes</hi> are extreamly apprehenſive of the exceſſive heat in <hi>Summer,</hi> which makes them grow ſtrong as they term it, that is, too biting, ſtringy, and ſometimes very hard; and therefore in that Seaſon we would affect to ſow them in very looſe Mellow Ground, where the Sun ſhines but little; and the beſt way ſhould be, to make up along by the ſides of ſome <hi>Northern</hi> Walls, a <hi>Bed</hi> or two for that purpoſe, filled with mold to the depth of a large foot and an half, and to ſow our <hi>Radiſhes</hi> there, and water them well. In <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> when the Sun is not ſo <hi>Hot, Radiſhes</hi> take well enough in open Ground, and in the wide unſheltered Air.</p>

                                 <hi>Raſs-berries,</hi> or <hi>Raſp-berries,</hi> as well as the <hi>White</hi> as <hi>Red,</hi> begin to Ripen at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>July.</hi> They are planted in <hi>March,</hi> either in <hi>Beds</hi> or borders obſerving the diſtance of two foot between Plant and Plant. They ſhoot out during the <hi>Summer</hi> many well Rooted Suckers, ſome of which we take away to make new plantations with, by which means the old ones are likewiſe renewed for they drie aſſoon as their <hi>Fruit</hi> is gathered. The only culture uſed to them is, firſt, in the Month of <hi>March</hi> to ſhorten all their new ſhoots which we preſerve round about the old ſtock, and which ought to be only the thickeſt and handſomeſt, and in the ſecond place, to pluck away all the ſmall ones, as likewiſe the old ones that are dead.</p>

It is propagated only by Seed which is ſown in <hi>March.</hi> We muſt be careful to ſow it pretty thin, whether it be in <hi>Beds</hi> or borders, or elſe at leaſt to thin it afterward, that its Roots may grow the bigger. <hi>Scorzonere</hi> runs up to Seed in the Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and is gathered aſſoon as 'tis Ripe.</p>
                              <p>Common <hi>Salſifie</hi> is another ſort of Root cultivated after the ſame manner as the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, but is not altogether ſo very excellent.

                                 <hi>Samphire</hi> called in <hi>French, Pierce Pierre,</hi> or <hi>Paſſe-Pierre,</hi> is one of our <hi>Sallet</hi> Furnitures that is multiplied only by Seed, and which being by nature very delicate requires to be planted by the ſides of Walls expoſed to the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>East,</hi> the open Air, and great <hi>Cold</hi> being pernicious to it.

They are multiplied only by Seed. We ſow them either in open Ground, or elſe in furrows or ſtrait rows upon well prepared <hi>Beds</hi> and this we do ſeveral times in the year, beginning about the ſixteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Month after; the firſt are fit to cut towards the middle of <hi>October,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Lent,</hi> and the laſt in <hi>Rogation</hi> time; Thoſe which remain after <hi>Winter,</hi> run up to Seed towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> which we gather about the middle of <hi>June.</hi> When they are once cut they ſpring up no more, as <hi>Sorrel</hi> do's. All their culture conſiſts in keeping them very clear from Weeds; and if the <hi>Autumn</hi> prove extraordinary dry, it is not amiſs to water them ſometimes.

                                 <hi>Sorrel</hi> in <hi>Kitchen-Garden</hi> terms, is placed under the title of <hi>Verdures,</hi> or <hi>Green</hi> Pot Herbs, and accordingly is much uſed in the Pot. There are ſome ſorts of it that produce a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Leaf than others, which are called <hi>Sorrel</hi> of the greater ſort. All the ſorts may be ſown in the Months of <hi>March, April, May, June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> too, provided they be allowed ſufficient time to grow big enough to reſiſt the rigour of the <hi>Winter,</hi> we ſow <hi>Sorrel</hi> either in open Ground, or elſe in ſtrait rows, or furrows, in <hi>Beds</hi> or borders, in all which caſes, it muſt be ſown very thick, becauſe many of its Plants periſh. It requires a ground that is naturally good, or elſe well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved with <hi>Muck.</hi> Its culture conſiſts in being kept very clear of Weeds, in being well watered, and being covered with a little mold once or twice a year, after 'tis firſt cut down very cloſe to the Ground. That mold ſerves to give it new vigour, and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt proper for applying it, is in the hot Months of the year. <hi>Sorrel</hi> is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly multiplied by Seed, though ſometimes we tranſplant ſome of it that thrives very well. We gather its Seed in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi> There is a particular ſort of <hi>Sorrel,</hi> which is called Round <hi>Sorrel,</hi> its Leaves being indeed Round, whereas thoſe of the other ſorts are very ſharp and pointed. The tender Leaves of this ſort are ſometimes mixed with <hi>Sallet</hi> Furnitures. But it is ordinarily uſed moſt in <hi>Bouillons,</hi> or thin Broths. It is multiplied by running Branches, that take Root in the Earth, as they run over it, which being taken off, and tranſplanted, produce thick Tufts which alſo produce other runners, and ſo in <hi>infinitum.</hi>

                                 <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> as well the <hi>White</hi> as the <hi>Red,</hi> multiply and perpetuate themſelves by running Suckers that ſpringing out of their old ſtocks, take Root. It is obſerved, that a new plantation of them taken out of the Woods, turns to better account when tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than one ſlipt of from the <hi>Garden Straw-berries.</hi> We plant them either in <hi>Beds</hi> or borders, both which muſt be well prepared, amended and laboured or ſtirred up in one manner or other. If it be in dry and ſandy Ground, both the <hi>Beds</hi> and borders muſt be ſunk a little lower than the Allies or path-ways, the better to retain both the rain that falls, and the water we beſtow on them; a quite contrary courſe muſt be taken, if we plant them in ſtrong, heavy, and fat Earth, and that is almoſt all pure Clay, becauſe exceſſive moiſture rots the Plants. We place them uſually nine or ten Inches aſunder, putting two or three little Plants into each hole which we make with a planting ſtick. The beſt time to plant them in is during the whole Month of <hi>May,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> that is to ſay, before the great heat comes in. And we may plant them all <hi>Summer</hi> long in rainy Seaſons. It is particularly requiſite to plant <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of them in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and that in ſome place near the <hi>North</hi> Quarter, the better to ſhelter them from the violent heat of the <hi>Summer</hi> Sun, and then we plant them but three or four Inches one from the other, and when they are grown big enough there, we tranſplant them afterwards in the Month of <hi>September</hi> in order to make <hi>Beds</hi> or ſquares of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we find occaſion to have a greater or leſs abundance of them. Their culture conſiſts chiefly, firſt, in watering them well in dry Seaſons; ſecondly in leaving, but a moderate number of ſtems or upright ſhoots to every ſtock, three or four of the moſt vigourous being enough; in the third place, in leaving but three or four <hi>Straw-berries</hi> of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48210:227"/>
them that appeared firſt, and neareſt the ſtock, on every ſtem, and therefore we muſt pinch of all their other Bloſſoms that almoſt endleſsly grow out at the ends of thoſe that have already Bloſſomed, or are ſtill in Bloſſom, becauſe none but the firſt produce any fair <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> hardly any of the laſt being ever known to knit or come to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but when we are careful to pinch them off judicially we may be aſſured always to have good <hi>Straw-berries.</hi> I have already given directions in the works of the Month of <hi>February,</hi> how to raiſe <hi>Haſting Straw-berries.</hi> Curious Perſons have uſually two <hi>Straw-barries</hi> of two ſeveral <hi>Colours,</hi> viz. <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> but they place them in ſeparate <hi>Beds.</hi> The great Enemies of <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plantations are the <hi>Ton's</hi> which are great <hi>White</hi> Worms, that in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> gnaw the necks of their Roots between two Earths, and ſo kill them; to prevent which, in thoſe Months we ſhould carefully ſearch every day, under the Roots of all our <hi>Straw-berries</hi> that begin to wither, where we ſhall commonly find one of theſe great Worms which after they have done a miſchief to one, paſs on to do the ſame to other <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants, and kill them in the ſame manner. <hi>Straw-berry</hi> Plants bear very well the year after their planting, if plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>May;</hi> but yield very indifferently, if not planted till <hi>September,</hi> after they are taken out of the Woods; yet in the ſecond year they bear wonderfully, but that being paſt, they produce but very pitifully, and therefore 'tis good to renew them every two years; it is likewiſe convenient to cut off every year their old tops, when the <hi>Straw-berries</hi> are gone, which is commonly at the latter end of <hi>July.</hi> The earlieſt <hi>Straw-berries</hi> that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> are thoſe that were planted by the ſides of <hi>Southern</hi> or <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Walls, and they that ripen laſt, are ſuch as are planted in a <hi>Northern Expoſition.</hi>

                                 <hi>WOrmwood.</hi> The plants of this and all other Plants placed in Borders of Edgings, and therefore called Border-plants, as of <hi>Time, Lavender, Hyſſop,</hi> &amp;c. are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Line, and at the diſtance of two or three Inches one from the other, and five or ſix inches deep in the Ground. It is good to clip them every Spring, and to renew them every two years, and to take away their oldeſt and decayed ſtocks. Their Seed is gathered about the Month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Shewing how long every <hi>Kitchen Plant</hi> may profitably ſtand in its place in a <hi>Kitchen-Garden;</hi> which of them muſt be houſed in the Conſervatory to ſupply us in the Winter, and which are they which we may force to grow by Art, in ſpite of the Froſt. And laſtly, how long each ſort of Seed will laſt without loſing its Virtue.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is a very important point in Gard'ning, to know how long every plant may uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poſſeſs the place where it grows in our Gardens, that ſo the forecaſt of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gard'ner, may prepare others immediately to ſubſtitute in the places of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as 'twere, but Paſſengers, take up their places but a few Months; for by this means, not only there remains no unprofitable ſpot of Ground in our Gardens, but we ſeem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to reap a ſenſible pleaſure by enjoying in ſome Senſe beforehand ſome things that are not yet in Nature.</p>
                        <p>To treat of this matter well, I think it very pertinent to ſpeak firſt of thoſe Plants that are of long duration, whether in reſpect of the time they take up in attaining to their Perfection, or of that in which they continue bearing. All ſorts of <hi>Grapes, Capers,</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus,</hi> doubtleſs, hold the firſt Rank in this number, for <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Caper plants</hi> laſt five and twenty or thirty years, and as to <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> reckoning from the time we firſt ſow or tranſplant them, we ought hardly ever to begin to gather them till their ſhoots be of a competent thickneſs, which happens not till the third or fourth year after, but after that time, provided they be placed in good Ground and carefully cultivated, they may very well be ſuffred to ſtand ten or twelve years, it being certain that they will not fail to ſhoot up and bear vigorouſly and plentifully during all that time; but yet if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any decay in them ſooner, we may deſtroy and break them up ſooner, and if on the contrary, we find them continue to produce well longer than we have limited, we may continue them longer in their places.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rasberry, Curran,</hi> and <hi>Gooſeberry</hi> ſhrubs, eaſily laſt eight or ten years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Artichokes</hi> muſt be renewed, that is new planted in a freſh place after the third year.</p>
                        <p>The Borders of <hi>Wormwood, Hyſſop, Lavender, Marjoram, Rue, Roſemary, Sage, Time, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. provided they be not endamaged by an extraordinary hard Winter, may ſubſiſt in their places three or four years, if care be taken to clip them pretty cloſe every Summer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alleluia,</hi> or <hi>Wood-ſorrel, Mint, Musked Chervil, Engliſh Cives, Tarragon, Sorrel, Patience,</hi> or <hi>ſharp Dock, Samphire, Macedonian Parſly</hi> or <hi>Aliſanders, Tripe-Madame,</hi> &amp;c. may likewiſe laſt well enough in their places three or four Years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Strawberry</hi> Plants may laſt three years, Wild <hi>Endive</hi> or <hi>Succory, Anis, Ordinary Parſly, Burnet, Fennel, Scorzonere,</hi> and <hi>Common Salſifie,</hi> &amp;c. laſt two years.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Garlick, Baſil, Naſturces</hi> or <hi>Capucin Capers, Cucumbers,</hi> and <hi>Melons</hi> or <hi>Muskmelons, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, Onions,</hi> and the firſt or <hi>Summer Turneps,</hi> &amp;c. take them up only during the Spring and Summer Seaſons, ſo that their places may receive a new Decoration of Plants in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Radiſhes, Purſlain,</hi> and <hi>Ordinary Chervil,</hi> &amp;c. take up their places but five or ſix Weeks, and therefore they muſt be new ſown every fifteen days in Summer time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hasting Peaſe</hi> and <hi>Beans,</hi> continue on the Ground ſix or ſeven Months, reckoning from the Month of <hi>November</hi> when they are ſown, but common <hi>Peas</hi> and <hi>Beans,</hi> and <hi>Aricôs,</hi> or <hi>French-Beans,</hi> take it up but four or five Months.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="204" facs="tcp:48210:228"/>
                           <hi>Spinage</hi> and <hi>Màches</hi> keep theirs all <hi>Autumn</hi> and Winter, and therefore are planted in places, where we have already raiſed ſuch Plants as laſt not beyond the Summer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mallows</hi> and <hi>Marſh-mallows</hi> are multiplied only by Seed, and paſs not beyond the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>The Plants that require houſing in the Conſervatory during Winter, are <hi>Cardoons, Cellery, Artichoke heads,</hi> both the <hi>Endives,</hi> as well the <hi>White,</hi> as the <hi>Wild</hi> ſort, all that are known by the name of Roots, as <hi>Red Beet Roots, Carrots,</hi> &amp;c. as likewiſe <hi>Leeks, Citruls</hi> or <hi>Pumpions, Potirons</hi> or <hi>Common Pumpions, Garlick,</hi> and <hi>Shalots.</hi> All the reſt reſiſt the injuries of the Winter well enough, <hi>viz. Cabbages, Parſly, Fennel, Cibouls,</hi> and even <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, Mint, Samphire, Tripe-Madame, Balm, Aſparagus, Sorrel,</hi> &amp;c. But they ſprout not till the Spring, unleſs forced on <hi>Hot Beds.</hi> Other Plants are not acquainted with that ſort of help, or rather Violence, ſuch as are all Roots, and <hi>Garlick, Onions, Leeks, Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages,</hi> &amp;c. Add to this, that by the ſame expedient of <hi>Hot Beds,</hi> we may alſo raiſe in the height of cold Weather, little <hi>Sallets</hi> of <hi>Lettuces,</hi> with their Furnitures of <hi>Creſſes, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Mint,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>There remains now nothing but to know how long each ſort of Seed will keep good, upon which I muſt tell you, that generally ſpeaking, moſt Seeds grow naught after one of two years at moſt, and therefore it concerns us always to be provided with new ones, if we would not run the hazard of ſowing to no purpoſe in the Spring. There are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any but <hi>Peas, Beans,</hi> and the Seeds of <hi>Muskmelons, Cucumbers, Citruls</hi> or <hi>Pumpions,</hi> and <hi>Potirons</hi> or <hi>Flat Cucumbers,</hi> that laſt eight or ten years. The Seeds of <hi>Collyflowers</hi> laſt three or four, and thoſe of all ſorts of <hi>Endive</hi> and <hi>Succory,</hi> five or ſix years. Of all ſorts of Seeds there are none that keep ſo ſmall a time as <hi>Lettuce Seed,</hi> which yet are better the ſecond, than the firſt year, but yet are good for nothing the third.</p>

                  <p>THE moſt Undegenerating ſort of <hi>Melons</hi> are not large, but of a middling Size, the Rind thin, faintly Embroider'd, and without being Ribb'd or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided along the Sides, or at leaſt very obſcurely: Others there are which be whitiſh, ſome of a Slate-colour, Red-fleſh, dry, yet melting in the Mouth, and not at all Mealy, but of an high and generous Guſt. In a word, the only ſort (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Trials of many hundred Kinds) I have Cultivated with Succeſs, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their good Qualities more than Twenty Years, without any conſiderable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Gard'ner</hi> now-a-days, knows how to raiſe <hi>Melons,</hi> but very few to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them; the greateſt difficulty whereof is in the Guelding of Superfluities, to cauſe them to knit, and bear as they ſhould do. In order to which, obſerve theſe few Directions:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48210:231"/>
The firſt thing appearing (after the Seed is Sown, and the Plants prick'd out from the <hi>Hot-Bed</hi> into a more temperate) are a pair of ſmall ſmooth Leaves, which (in <hi>France)</hi> we call the Ears, marked 1. 1. in the <hi>Figure</hi> above. A few days after, 'twixt theſe, comes up a ſingle Leaf, which we call the Firſt Leaf, as being on the firſt Knot, <hi>noted</hi> 2. Next to this, in the ſame place, and ſoon after, there appears another, which we term the Second Knot, <hi>marked</hi> 3. About the middle of whoſe Stalk there ſhoots out another Leaf, call'd the Third Knot, <hi>Figur'd</hi> 4. Which Third Knot is always to be Pruned off at <hi>Fig.</hi> 6. but with Care, and without Wounding the Stalk or Branch of the Second Knot, <hi>marked</hi> 3, upon which that Third did grow; it being from this place you will find that Branch to Sprout, which we call the Firſt Leader; and is that which will ſend out a Firſt, Second, and Third Knot; which Third (and all other ſuch Thirds) you muſt Cut, or pinch off, as you did the other, without ſtaying 'till a Fourth, or Fifth, or more, ſhoot out. It is, I ſay, from theſe Knots and Joints, that other Branches in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will proceed, knit, and form into Excellent Fruit, provided the Foot and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Stem have been well nouriſh'd in rich, warm, and proper Mould, and well expos'd.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not forget, that from the middle, likewiſe 'twixt the Ears and two firſt Leaves, there frequently riſes another Branch, which you may abate, or leave on, as you find it likely to prove, eſpecially if a vigorous one; but the Leaf <hi>Figur'd</hi> 5, iſſuing from the middle of the Fourth Joint, and ſeveral more beſides, ſucceſſively Springing out of one another, as you ſee the Fourth from the Third (and as all the reſt I have marked do) I purpoſely omit, and have only Figur'd, as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to the Ingenious <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I Tranſplant from this <hi>Nurſery-Bed</hi> (into the prepared Holes or Ridges, and open <hi>Meloniere)</hi> I commonly place two <hi>Roots</hi> together, unleſs I meet with an extraordinary good Plant, and then ſpare both the Branches which Spring from each ſide, 'twixt the Ear and Leaf 7, 7, as before is ſhew'd: But when I Plant two <hi>Roots</hi> near each other (as I do when they are not very fair ones) I totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both Branches which ſhoot from the two oppoſite Ears, to avoid that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of thoſe Supernumeraries which injure the principal Stem and Foot it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Never ſuffer the <hi>Root,</hi> or <hi>Stalks</hi> of your <hi>Melon</hi> Plants, to touch the Dung; nor ſhould you Water them immoderately, but when the Earth is very dry, and the Seaſon exceſſively hot, refreſh, and give the <hi>Roots</hi> Drink, without deferring it 'till the <hi>Shoots</hi> complain, when it may come too late: I Water them in theſe parching Seaſons, two or three times every Week, and in the Evenings when the <hi>Sun</hi> is Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and then cover them with <hi>Matraſſes,</hi> from Eleven 'till Two a Clock; and in the Afternoon during the <hi>Suns</hi> exceſſive violence, which Exhauſts, and Conſumes the Humidity neceſſary to both <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Branches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cover my <hi>Meloniere</hi> alſo when it Rains, leſt too much Moiſture prejudice the Fruit; all which requires a great deal of Care, and no ſmall Pains, though this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proceeding is to me a real Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>When the Foot of your <hi>Melon</hi> Plant grows over Luxurious in Branches, cut away the feebleſt of them, leaving not above three or four of the moſt vigorous, and whoſe Knots grow neareſt to one another: And when the <hi>Melons</hi> are Knit, ſuffer not above two upon each Foot, chooſing ſuch as are beſt plac'd, and neareſt to the main and principal Stem, which ſhould be thick, ſnug, and not too far above the Ground. Of theſe that are knit, and beginning to form, make choice of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt, that are well Truſs'd with a thick ſhort Tail; <hi>Melons</hi> with long ſtarts, ſlender, and narrow Leaves, never prove worth any thing.</p>
                  <p>When you begin to Cover with Bells, raiſe them ſo upon little Forks, as they neither reſt upon the Fruit or Branches, or quite exclude the Air; but ſo as to keep the edges from bruiſing, and preſſing the tender <hi>Stalk,</hi> and Intercepting the Current <hi>Sap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It now and then happens, that there riſes a ſecond Branch from between the Ears, and two firſt Leaves (though I mention'd indeed but one) but this is very ſeldom; and you are ſtill to count them but for one Joint or-Knot, though there will thence proceed a Second, Third, Fourth, and perhaps Twenty or Thirty more, and further remote, if you let them alone, and be not vigilant to reſtrain, and ſtop this ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>berance in due time. 'Tis true, they will preſent you with Fruit at the Extremities of their Branches, but 'tis little worth, as being ſo far diſtant from the <hi>Root,</hi> that the <hi>Sap</hi> ſpends it ſelf in the tedious paſſage before it arrives, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48210:231"/>
you'll find by the wither'd Branch, and dryneſs of the Leaves which ſhould skreen both Branches and Fruit, 'till they are Ripe, as we ſee they do, where a <hi>Melon</hi> has a ſhort and ſubſtantial Foot. A Curious <hi>Gard'ner</hi> therefore ſhould viſit his <hi>Meloniere</hi> from time to time, and be Cutting off all Mutilated, Starv'd and Vicious Branches which annoy the Plants, for theſe Impertinents will grow even to the view of ones Eye, and quite Impoveriſh the Fruit, if not timely prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee I am careful to Purge the Stems of all the ſmall, ſtraggling, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Branches, from which there is no expectation of good Fruit, whilſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thoſe that have well knit <hi>Melons</hi> on them at the ends of the Branches, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly take away the reſt of that Branch on this ſide the Fruit, which-divaricating into other uſeleſs Wanderers, would Rob, and deprive the Fruit of the Nutriment derived from the <hi>Root;</hi> nevertheleſs with this Caution, that in Pruning, I ſpare ſome other leſs Noxious Branches to ſhade the Fruit, that it be not left quite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and expos'd to ſuch a ſcorching Heat as would hinder its Growth and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, which within Forty days from its Nativity and knitting into Fruit, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives to full Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Great and Pumpion-like <hi>Melons</hi> are very ſeldom tollerably good, as arriving to their bulk either from the Nature of the Seed and Kind, or from ſuperfluous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſmaller ones; wherefore (though as I ſaid they cannot ſupport the too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Heats) the leſs Water you give your Plants (provided you find them not to want it) the better; and that rather a little at a time than much: Once a Week is for moſt part ſufficient. As to this therefore you muſt determine, and regulate your Refreſhments with great Circumſpection, and Judge by the Nouriſhment which you concieve Neceſſary to Produce and Maintain the Foot, with its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Leaves deriving from it; without which no Kind and Genuine Fruit is to be expected.</p>
                  <p>When you would Gather a Ripe <hi>Melon,</hi> you will have notice by its turning a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Yellow; for from that time, within a day (as the Weather proves) it does or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Ripen, and begin to caſt a grateful Scent: This Yellowneſs appearing in ſome part of it or other, and not ſeldom with ſome Rift, or little Caſm's about the Stalk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moſt Infallible Indications of its being left rather too long, than too haſtily Gather'd: The <hi>Gard'ner</hi> muſt therefore not fail of Viſiting the <hi>Meloniere</hi> at the leaſt three times a day, Morning, Noon, and Evening, for this Critical time of Ripening. He will ſometimes find <hi>Melons</hi> Ripen too faſt, but they are ſeldom or never Good, as proceeding rather from a ſickly, or vicions <hi>Root,</hi> than from the Nature of the Plant, or Species of thoſe I Cultivate.</p>
                  <p>After Twenty four Hours keeping, or the next day after it has been Gather'd (for ſo long, contrary to Vulgar Opinion, it ſhould be preſerv'd in ſome ſweet dry place) and not Eaten immediately as it comes from the Garden: A perfect and tranſcendent <hi>Melon</hi> will be Full, Juicy, and without any Vacuity (which you'll eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern by Rapping a little with your Knuckles upon the outſide of the Fruit) the Meat ſhould alſo be dry, or but a little Rorid meazing out of the Pulp; but by no means Watriſh and Flaſhy. To this add a Vermillion Colour, a grateful Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and an high and Racy Taſte.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Reſerve for Seed of that only which lies towards the Sunny ſide of the <hi>Melon,</hi> which being immediately cleans'd from its Muſilage, with a dry Linnen Cloth, Reſerve in Boxes, or Papers, in ſome Temperate and Sweeter place.</p>

                  <p>There are likewiſe ſome among 'em, who carry the Secret a great deal farther, and that pretend the Kinds and Species of Orange-Trees are almoſt infinite, and ſuch as (how true ſoever) were enough to affright the moſt Curious, if, as they would make one believe, every one of thoſe Kinds did abſolutely require a certain Specific Salt peculiar to them, and would imbark us upon ſuch an Ocean of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as hardly any Body would adventure upon a Voyage ſo dangerous, and where the Ship-wreck ſeems almoſt inevitable.</p>
                  <p>But, as in our Ort-yards and Olitorie Gardens, where the Number of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſeveral Kinds, do greatly exceed thoſe of Orange Trees, Experience
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48210:233"/>
teaches us, that the very ſame Culture does very near ſerve for all ſorts of Kernel-Fruit, all kind of Stone-Fruit, and all Verdures whatſoever: Upon this Experience therefore we preſume, that there needs no other Culture for all the ſorts of Orange Trees, and this upon very good Aſſurance, daily Trials, and convincing Proofs.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not therefore ſtand upon ſo many and great Difficulties, by which both the one and the other have deterr'd many Curious Perſons, Paſſionate Lovers of the Orange Tree: A Paſſion, in my Opinion, the moſt reaſonable, and beſt plac'd, of any; ſince, in effect, through the whole extent of Gard'ning, we find neither Plant nor Trees that afford us ſo much Delight, and that are ſo laſting: For there is not a day throughout the whole Year, wherein Orange Trees may not (and as they ſhould do,) gratifie and court their Lovers, either by the Verdure of their Leaves, the Agreeableneſs of their Shape, Plenty, and Perfume of their Flowers; and, in a word, the Beauty, Goodneſs, and Durableneſs of their Fruit; ſo as I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is no Man more charm'd with them than my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In Favour therefore of ſuch whoſe Inclinations I find ſo general for theſe Trees, I take a third Party totally oppoſite to the Doctrine of theſe Myſtery-Men, and do declare, that, after a long and ample Examination, there ſeems nothing in the whole Art of Gardning ſo eaſie, and little difficult, as the Culture of Orange Trees, be it either the raiſing them from their firſt Principles, the governing them afterwards, and maintaining them in good Condition, when once they have been ſet; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Recovery of thoſe that are ſick, of any Difficulty; notwithſtanding all which, I think, one may (according to every Man's Ability,) reſolve to ſtore ones ſelf with <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> provided one have an able <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> and a good <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> without which, indeed, I would adviſe none to enter upon this Curioſity; for, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am, the <hi>Orangiſt Gard'ner</hi> is abſolutely guilty, and to blame, either through groſs Ignorance, Lazineſs, want of Diligence, Application, or over-fondneſs to his myſterious Fancies, if his <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> do not thrive; provided, I ſay, that his <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> be not faulty, nor the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Mould</hi> in which they are planted; or that the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> be not diſproportionate to the <hi>Root,</hi> or there be ſome defect in the <hi>Caſing,</hi> which may perhaps be ill made, or not in fit Seaſon, or, eſpecially, by over-watering, and the too much uſe of Fire during Winter, which is not at all needful, or of Water during Summer, which ſhould be given with great Moderation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall, in the next place (after I have declared what my Opinion in general is, as to the eaſie Culture of <hi>Orange-Trees,)</hi> explain, what Conditions are required in a good <hi>Green-Houſe:</hi> This eaſie Culture, which I ſpeak of, I know does not pleaſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Doctor <hi>Orangiſts:</hi> They'll tell ye, that both thoſe who believe it, and thoſe who publiſh it, do not themſelves underſtand it: However, without being in the leaſt diſcourag'd with what they ſay, I ſhall adventure to declare my Opinion upon this Matter.</p>

                        <p>Of the eaſie Culture of <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN Confirmation of what I undertake to prove in this Chapter, I advance Five Propoſitions, which I hold for indubitable: The Firſt is, That we have hardly any <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Trees</hi> which take <hi>Root</hi> ſo eaſily: Secondly, That there's none which ſo naturally agree with all ſorts of Nouriſhment: Thirdly, That theſe are the moſt laſting and longaevous <hi>Trees</hi> of all others: And in the Fourth Place, That there are none leſs obnoxious, and ſubject to Infirmities: And Laſtly, None that have ſo few particular Enemies as <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tons,</hi> which kill our <hi>Strawberry-Plants</hi> at the <hi>Root,</hi> and the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> which ſpoil their <hi>Leaves;</hi> the <hi>Canker-worm</hi> that cuts them off to the very Ground; the <hi>Field Mice, little Flies,</hi> and <hi>Gnats,</hi> which deſtroy our <hi>Artichoaks:</hi> The <hi>Gumm, Piſmires, ſmall Fleas,</hi> that ruine <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> and the <hi>Tyger-bob</hi> which ravage the <hi>Pear-Trees;</hi> all theſe afflicting Accidents attacquing our <hi>Melons,</hi> and invading all our <hi>Olitory</hi> and <hi>Kitchin-Garden</hi> Furniture, are what we may truly reckon to be the greateſt Enemies to <hi>Gard'ning</hi> in general; Enemies, I ſay redoubtable Enemies, invincible, and by conſequence, a Thouſand Times more dangerous than any others whatſoever that menace our <hi>Orange-Trees:</hi> Some Foes I confeſs they have, nor are they altogether exempt, as there's no Plant which is; I ſhall here therefore examine them one by one, and in the mean time, preſcribe ſuch Remedies as are proper for their Cure and Preſervation.</p>
                     <p>The particular Enemies of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are the <hi>Piſmires,</hi> the <hi>Punaiſe</hi> or <hi>Bug, Ear-wigs, &amp;c.</hi> but all the Miſchief they are able to do, is far from being Mortal: There's nothing more eaſie than a Defenſive War againſt their rudeſt Inſults; for firſt of all, as to <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Piſmires,</hi> which ſometimes come upon <hi>Trees</hi> in whole Troops, and gnaw the <hi>Leaves;</hi> they rarely invade the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> ſave when baited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic'd by <hi>Bug-Eggs:</hi> This filthy Spawn, (as all <hi>Orangiſts</hi> well know without need of much Deſcription) can prejudice them no further, than to make the <hi>Tree</hi> look all over ſoul, ſqualid, and not ſo agreeable to the Eye as a <hi>Tree</hi> ſhould be, whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Beauty conſiſts in the Neatneſs and Cleanneſs as well of its Boughs as Leaves; this ſort of Filth is bred by certain winged <hi>Mother-Inſects,</hi> but too well known by their green Colour, and naſty Smell, proceeding from their Bodies being bruiſed: They lay their Spawn in <hi>Autumn,</hi> almoſt as do the <hi>Silk-worms,</hi> and wind their Bags eſpecially about the dry and withered Twigs, and under the foul and rumpled <hi>Leaves;</hi> one would take them at firſt but for little reddiſh Frecles and Spots, whilſt they no ſooner appear on a <hi>Tree</hi> (how few ſoever they are) but the heat of Summer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes them grow, extend, and ſwell, 'till they become as big as a Lentil, and then they hatch and multiply, and in Autumn again produce infinite Numbers of others: But as theſe Neſts are neither errant, fugitive, or volatile, one eaſily ſpies where they faſten, and may as eaſily take them away, ſo one begin the Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and eſpecially when firſt you bring the <hi>Trees</hi> forth of the <hi>Green-Houſe:</hi> Theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48210:234"/>
pull'd off with your Fingers, or cleanſed with a little Bruſh, you'll immediately be ſecured from the <hi>Piſmires,</hi> which give over their Hoſtility againſt <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>Bugs</hi> are gone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Earwigs,</hi> thoſe little, long, reddiſh, nimble Inſects, that now and then invade the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> (ſharing both <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> and marring their prime <hi>Beauty.)</hi> are not ſo eaſily deſtroy'd as thoſe we newly mentioned: But as the Miſchief is not Mortal, reaches not to the <hi>Roots,</hi> and happens but ſeldom, there are ways enough to prevent it; as by ſticking up Caps of Paper, and Neat-hoofs in ſeveral Places of each <hi>Tree:</hi> Theſe pernicious ſmall Inſects, that go out to forage during Night only, you'll be ſure to meet with in their Retreat and hiding-Places as ſoon as 'tis Day, when viſiting the Hoods and Hoofes, you may cruſh them under Foot, and with eaſe diſpatch them.</p>
                     <p>Another Expedient is by Veſſels of Earth, Wood, Lead, or Copper made ſquare, or round, and hollow; there are alſo of them of two Faſhions; one whereof is to be ſet about the Stem of every <hi>Tree;</hi> the others under all the four Feet of each Caſe: Thoſe that are for the Stem or Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> are compoſed of two Pieces, which may eaſily be glew'd or cemented together, when they are plac'd about the Stem, and ſo accurately cloſe to it, as to hold the Water you pour into it: The others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but of one Piece, which are to be put under the Feet of the Caſes, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with Water like the firſt, are an invincible Obſtacle againſt <hi>Earwigs,</hi> which being no good Swimmers, will hardly attempt the Liquid Paſſage. Thus are <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> intirely ſafe from Deſolation by <hi>Earwigs.</hi> The ſame Veſſels are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Protection againſt <hi>Piſmires;</hi> ſhould there any be ſo bold to adventure the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and get over to theſe beautiful <hi>Trees,</hi> as ſome perhaps will try to do, though there be no more of that <hi>Bug-Spawn</hi> which ſo powerfully attracts them.</p>
                     <p>There are beſides theſe miſchievous Minute Creatures (againſt which <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> require Defence) ſeveral other great and ſore Inconveniencies, to which they (in common with all other <hi>Fruit-Trees)</hi> are obnoxious, whilſt they ſtand abroad and are expoſed: As namely, impetuous Winds, white and pretty hard Froſts, and above all, great Hails; but ſince ſuch Calamities happen rarely, a <hi>Gard'ner</hi> ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd is rather to be extreamly pitied, than at all to be blam'd, eſpecially in caſe of Hail: 'Tis a Miſchief which comes like a Ruine on the ſudden, and which no Fore-ſight can well prevent, be one's Carenever ſo great, and therefore no Remedy but Patience.</p>
                     <p>As for Danger of Winds, ſuch as for moſt part are thoſe between the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> ſeldom blowing before the beginning of <hi>Autumn;</hi> they give fair Warning to Remove <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> to ſome place of Shelter from their Fury; be it in ſome Houſe, or under Protection of a Wall, or Grove of Trees, ſo plac'd and oppos'd to the Weather, as the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> may, at leaſt ſome part of the Day, enjoy the Comfort of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Froſts, in as much as we ſeldom bring <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> out of the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> 'till it be towards <hi>Mid-May,</hi> and commonly ſhut them up again about the Middle of <hi>October:</hi> They are Times when theſe <hi>Trees</hi> are ſafe, and ſufficiently out of their reach: Theſe kind of Spring Froſts, which came in the tail of Winter, uſually end about <hi>Mid-May;</hi> and the Seaſon praedicting their fierce Return, is not come at <hi>Mid-October:</hi> As for the ſmall White Froſts, which ſome times continue till half <hi>May</hi> is ſpent, and appear again at the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> they do no conſiderable Damage to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that are Sound and in Health: Indeed, the Sick and Crazy may ſuffer and receive Prejudice by them, by reaſon of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Tenderneſs, which they would not have done if ſtrong and vigorous; that is, well govern'd, and treated as they ought to have been.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, being ſufficiently aſſur'd, that the Beauty and Preſervation of the <hi>Trees</hi> we diſcourſe of, does in the firſt place, ſo entirely depend upon the being provided with a good and well-qualified <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> as that whoever pretends to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> is never to expect any tolerable Succeſs and Contentment, without beginning with this neceſſary Precaution: It follows, that before we proceed any farther in explaining what more belongs to their <hi>Culture</hi> and Government, the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> be the firſt Thing we ought next to ſpeak of, as of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Conditions of a good <hi>Green-Houſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO the having a good and well condition'd <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> there are in my Opinion, Five principal Qualities requiſite: The Firſt is, That it be well plac'd and expos'd: Secondly, That it have ſufficient Openings, and they well provided, and guarded with all that is neceſſary for the ſhutting them up cloſe when the Seaſon requires it: Thirdly, That the Walls be made of a good Thickneſs, and ſubſtantially built: Fourthly, That it be well cover'd: And laſtly, That the Floor be laid even and firm. Let us now examine each of theſe Conditions in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Firſt, 'tis univerſally agreed upon, That the <hi>Meridian</hi> Expoſure and Situation is abſolutely the beſt, ſo that it may enjoy the Sun from the Hour of Ten in the Morning, 'till it ſets, or is almoſt ready to go down. The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which receives the <hi>Sun</hi> from its Riſing till Noon, or a little after, is alſo very good. That of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which enjoys the Sun but from Noon to the Evening, may ſerve for want of the other two; whil'ſt the <hi>North</hi> is very pernicious and good for nothing, as hardly ſeeing the Sun at all either Morning or Afternoon.</p>
                     <p>The Second Property of a good <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> namely, That it have fair Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; requires that the Doors and Shutters be ſo made, as that the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> may eaſily paſs thro' them; and the Windows large, and ſo high, as almoſt to touch the Timbers which ſupport the Cieling, which is commonly about three Foot, and five or ſix Foot in breadth; ſo as having occaſion to open them at any time in the Winter (as 'tis requiſite) when the Sun ſhines invitingly, all the <hi>Trees</hi> may receive the Warmth and Comfort of his Beams: And in caſe any Moiſture remain among them, it may be dried up by the Virtue of this bright Planet: Theſe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſhould alſo be fitted within ſide of the Houſe, with <hi>Chaſſis</hi> of doubled Paper, that is, by glewing the Sheets on both ſides of the Frame; and without this, another <hi>Chaſſis</hi> of Glaſs: As for other Shutters of Wood, they ſignifie little, and are nothing comparable to the other, which ſhould be accurately ſtopp'd, and cauk'd during the Winter, to ſeclude and keep out all acceſs of the cold Air from penetrating, which would infallibly chill and abate the warm and comfortable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which the Air in the Houſe received from the Sun, when the Windows were lately open'd upon thoſe fair Days we mentioned, and without which, the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> would not preſerve their good Looks.</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place, all the Walls of the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> (thoſe eſpecially that are to the <hi>North)</hi> ſhould be built of good Free-ſtone and Mortar, Chalk and Sand (which doubtleſs is beſt) or of Plaſter, (which is not the worſt) provided the Walls be ſo carefully wrought, and well joynted, that there be no Crevices or void Places left between the Stones: Where Stones are not eaſily to be had, they may be built of Loame, tempered, and mingled with Straw or Hay; or with a double Cloiſon made of Boards well Rabetted, filling the void between with Earth or <note n="*" place="margin">They in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> uſe <hi>Chaff,</hi> or, (which is certainly better, becauſe of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,) <hi>Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt,</hi> exceeding well dried in the Sun; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the whole Houſe a Coat of <hi>Pitch.</hi>
                        </note> Sand, ſo as the Walls and Partitions, as well of the one as the other, be at the leaſt two Foot, or two and an half, in thickneſs: Happy in the mean time are they, who with all this, have ſome other Building, dry Bank, or Grove of tall Trees to bask it on the <hi>North!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Since both the Cold and Wet is apt to inſinuate and get in through the Roof and Covering, as well as through the Sides of the Houſe: The Cieling and Floor above ought to be of a good thickneſs; and beſides that, be clad in Winter with a Thatch of Hay or Straw, unleſs there happen to be a Room or Lodging over Head, or ſome Gallery, whoſe Windows alſo muſt be kept very cloſe ſhut, whilſt the cold Weather continues: Or, except at leaſt it be ſubſtantially vaulted and cover'd with ſtore of Earth, or ſome ſuch Material as we have deſcrib'd. Laſtly,</p>
                     <p>The Lower Floor of the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> (which cannot poſſibly be too dry) ſhould methinks, be laid a little higher than the Area or Walk without, or at leaſt even with it; but by no means much lower, for fear of Dampneſs, which is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious than the Cold it ſelf; in as much as there's hardly any Remedy for this, as there is againſt the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48210:235"/>
Thoſe who have not heard what I formerly objected againſt the Uſe of Fire, (which is ſometimes made in the <hi>Green-Houſe)</hi> will preſently conclude, that whilſt I diſcourſe of Remedies againſt the Cold, I would have it underſtood to be Fire of Charcoal, which they commonly make in ſeveral places of the Houſe; but in truth, I mean nothing leſs, ſeeing on the contrary, I am of Opinion and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Convinc'd, that ſort of Fuel to be no leſs than Exitial, and hurtful to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> than either cold or wet, as I pretend to prove.</p>
                     <p>Having then ſpoken of the height of the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> Floor, it remains to ſhew, that it may be made of well beaten, hard and compacted <hi>Salpeter'd-</hi>Earth, or of Plaſter; or which is to be preferr'd before all, a Floor of well lay'd Planks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ou de Salpetre batu.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what was ſaid of the height of the Floor, it needs muſt follow, that Cellars, and Vaults are very dangerous, and often Mortal, as well to <hi>Orange-Trees, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Jeſſimines, Myrtles, &amp;c.</hi> as generally to all <hi>Cas'd,</hi> and <hi>Impotted Shrubs</hi> whatſoever, for that ſuch low Subterraneous places are commonly damp and moiſt, out of reach, and far from receiving any comfort from the Sun, without whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, no <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> can be fitly qualified.</p>
                     <p>As to the breadth and length of the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> within ſide, it were not deſirable it ſhould exceed Twenty-four Feet, although it might well be made from Thirty to Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſix, or a little more, nor would the Houſe be much the worſe, provided the height be withal proportionable, and ſo dry, as neither Cold, nor Wet get entrance. They are not the Sun beams immediately darting on the <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> Leaves, that are ſo eſſentially ſalutary and propitious to them, ſeeing they ſeldom viſit the foliage in the middle, and interior parts of the branches, and head of the Tree, how ever advantagiouſly expos'd; but they are thoſe Rays of the Sun, which ſhine into the whole Capacity of the Houſes, that diſpel, and hinder this humidity from ſettling and doing the miſchief.</p>
                     <p>And thus having Eſtabliſh'd for a general Maxim, that ſuppoſing one is well provided of a good <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> it is eaſie to be Maſter of fair, and excellent <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi> I next come to explain more particularly, what my Opinion is of their <hi>Culture.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO ſpeak of this as Intelligibly as is poſſible, I conceive there are five Articles to be conſider'd; the knowledge of which, will be of great Inſtruction to the newly Curious: Thoſe I mean, who are altogether Strangers to theſe Matters, and are deſirous to Learn.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt, and which is very Important for the removing of many Scruples is about the Compoſition of the Earth and Mould, moſt proper for the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> as we Plant in <hi>Pots</hi> or <hi>Caſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second, treats of the way of Raiſing them from Seed, and afterwards how to Graft them; and more eſpecially, what there's to be done to <hi>Trees</hi> of great, or leſſer Growth, newly brought from other Countries, whether naked, ſtrip'd, and without any Clod, or <hi>Earth</hi> adhering to the <hi>Roots</hi> (like other <hi>Fruit-Trees)</hi> or whether with their Leaves on, together with the Clod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When I ſay, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in this manner, we would <hi>Impot</hi> or <hi>Caſe</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>The Third Article, directs the ſhape, and bigneſs of the <hi>Caſes</hi> to be us'd, and what is to be done about the Clod, and <hi>Roots</hi> of ſuch as are to be new <hi>Caſed,</hi> with the manner of doing it, which are two Eſſential points in this <hi>Culture,</hi> and alſo Rules concerning Watering.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Article, ſhews how to dreſs and faſhion the heads of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> whether it be to Recover ſuch as have been long neglected, or ill treated, or ſuch as have ſuffer'd by the Froſt, or humidity of Winter; or, that one would have handſom Trees, that ſhould always maintain their beautiful Figure in health and vigour, without loſing their Leaves.</p>

                     <p>SINCE <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees,</hi> are Strangers among us, and as one may ſay, come Artificially into <hi>Climates</hi> ſubject to rigorous <hi>Winters;</hi> as here in the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> and other <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, whereas they grow Spontaneouſly and Naturally in warmer places. It makes ſome to fancy, that this may partly proceed from ſome defect in the <hi>Earth</hi> that's us'd, as well as from the <hi>Air</hi> we breathe in, which cauſes theſe <hi>Trees</hi> to undergo ſome inconvenience here: And upon this, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Gard'ner</hi> makes a wondrous <hi>Myſtery,</hi> forſooth, of certain peculiar <hi>Compoſitions</hi> of <hi>Earths,</hi> &amp;c. And of this, there are various Conteſts, and very different Opinions. For,</p>
                     <p>Some will have the main Importance of the <hi>Mixture,</hi> to conſiſt as well in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of <hi>Ingredients</hi> (eſpecially if they be hard to come by) as in the ſeveral <hi>Doſes:</hi> Others, in the frequent removing and ſtirring the Mould, ſo blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; without which, they conceive all the reſt unprofitable, and of no effect. There be others, who ſtand much upon the Antiquity, and Age of the <hi>Compoſition;</hi> and that what has been longeſt made and prepared, is beſt: Some again, for that which has moſt been ſtirr'd. In fine, moſt of them make chiefeſt Account of the lighter <hi>Ingredients</hi> for their <hi>Mixture,</hi> namely, ſuch as is Sifted, and reduc'd to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, The <hi>Marc</hi> of <hi>Wine, Earth</hi> of an old <hi>Hot-bed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould never have done, ſhould I ſpeak particularly to every <hi>Orangiſt's Conceit</hi> upon this Subject: 'Tis certain, there's hardly one of them but pretends to ſome rare, and peculiar Secret, that no body has ſave himſelf, and which he would not impart to another for any thing in the World. I'll ſuppoſe they all have reaſon to be ſatisfied with their manner of proceeding, nor is it for me to contradict them, none ever heard me Cenſure them for it: In the mean time, for my own part, as I think I have made choice of a Method Eaſie and Simple, and that appears to me very conformable to the general Courſe and Order of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nature of the <hi>Trees,</hi> under conſideration, I ſhall endeavour to explain it to the Curious, and let them ſee with what Succeſs I have long made uſe of it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. There are alſo, divers other Worthy Perſons, who have thought good to purſue my Method for their <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> who ſhall be my <hi>Vouchers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before I enter far on this Explication, I declare again (once for all) that whatever the <hi>Earth</hi> produces, be they <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Trees,</hi> there is none of them, (as to their <hi>Culture,</hi> their <hi>Complexion</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution)</hi> more Eaſie, Tractable, and (as I may ſay) Accommodant, than are <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees;</hi> the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they are Govern'd by, in ſeveral places, viſibly juſtifie it. One may, in my Opinion, fitly reſemble them to thoſe Healthy, and Vigorous Youths, who Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning themſelves to Debauchery, and diſorderly Courſes, their Juvenile ſtrength does, for all that, often Repair the breaches of their irregular Lives; but it laſts but for a certain time, the Young Perſon, accuſtoming his Body to that, which in fine, muſt abſolutely deſtroy him, or at leaſt extreamly alter, and impair its Robuſt Compoſure. 'Tis juſt ſo with our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which are Naturally wonderful, ſtrong and lively; ſo as by that, they eaſily Repair whatever Nouriſhment (though little agreeable to their kind) it be, that may corrupt and ſpoil them. It is not with theſe <hi>Trees</hi> as with certain other <hi>Vegetables,</hi> ſome of which will thrive and live no where, but in a dry and light Soil; others, ſave in the Fat and Moiſt, whereas <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> live in either, but by no means thrive ſo well in one, as in the other.</p>
                     <p>That which I would eſpecially recommend to Obſervation, concerning the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which (as we ſaid) are but ſtrangers to our Climate, is to take good Notice out of what ſort of <hi>Earth</hi> they were brought, and did Naturally grow in, and accordingly endeavour to Replant them in the like, as near as one can gueſs: By this Inquiry, I have found that they moſt Naturally thrive, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48210:236"/>
grow to Perfection, in Strong, Fat, and Heavy <hi>Earth,</hi> and from thence conclude, that it were convenient, by Art, (which ſhould ever imitate Nature) to prepare Mould that were accordingly Rich and Weighty: But foraſmuch as theſe <hi>Trees,</hi> being ſet in <hi>Caſes,</hi> this heavy Fat <hi>Earth,</hi> which is to Nouriſh them (without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Aſſiſtance from the Neighbouring Mould) would be apt to grow dry, and hard almoſt as a Stone, ſo as becoming unfit for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> cannot ſpread and extend themſelves, without Adminiſtring ſome Succour to them. It follows, that of Neceſſity we not only afford them due Watering and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſuch as may eaſily, and univerſally penetrate throughout, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome means muſt be found, that this <hi>Earth</hi> be well, and induſtriouſly ſtirr'd, and made looſe, to correct its Natural Sluggiſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>But you'll preſently Object, as to this dull and heavy <hi>Material</hi> I ſo commend, That the Sun, which looks but obliquely upon us, cannot have the ſame effects as it has in thoſe <hi>Climates</hi> where it Darts its Beams more directly. This is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objection of our <hi>Orangiſts.</hi> To which I reply in the firſt place, That as every body ſees (and is confirm'd by daily Experience) the Heat which we have here during the four or five Months in which our <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are expos'd, is ſufficiently great to make them Live, and that with a great deal of vigour for a long time. In the ſecond place, That the <hi>Cas'd-Mould</hi> being open to the Air, and conſequently viſited on every ſide by the <hi>Sun,</hi> receives the Impreſſions of its Heat almoſt as freely, as what being in the wide and open Field, enjoys its Beams on the Superficies only. And laſtly, That the <hi>Earth</hi> being thus made looſe, as well as ponderous, is by this Expedient render'd eaſie and compliant for the <hi>Roots</hi> to ſpread in, and for the <hi>Water</hi> to penetrate and refreſh it, and by ſo much the more diſpos'd to entertain the impreſſions of the warmth which it requires: And thus we render it capable of receiving that by our Art, which would be ſuperfluous, and too much in the hotter Countries.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Foundation and Reaſon (be it in what Country ſoever) I endeavour to find out the beſt, natural Common-<hi>Earth,</hi> and leaſt Stony that I can light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all the Neighbourhood: That is to ſay, Mould which has ſubſtance, and is pretty ſolid; by no means Clay, which I look on as Dead, but ſuch as all ſorts of <hi>Plants</hi> ſeem naturally to delight in by their growth and thriving. Nor am I much concern'd what colour it is of, though for the moſt part, and to ſight, the blacker be moſt agreeable and approv'd of. For Example, That which is proper for <hi>Hemp,</hi> good <hi>Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Paſture-Ground,</hi> or of an <hi>High-way,</hi> or that lying low, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Water, and Drainings of ſome higher rich Ground. Of this <hi>Earth</hi> I take as much as I have need, and without farther trouble of preferring that which lies uppermoſt, (and which indeed, is the beſt in moſt Mens Opinions) I rather chooſe that which lies undermoſt, provided it appears to be of the ſame quality of that which is above it, ever ſeeking that which is freſheſt; I mean, that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never ſaw the <hi>Sun,</hi> and conſequently, has never yet ſerved to the Nouriſhment of any <hi>Plant;</hi> ſo as 'tis not only to be preſum'd, that it retains in it all its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Salts,</hi> but a good part likewiſe of that which the upper, and Incumbent Ground, through which it has been the drain, contributes to it.</p>
                     <p>After this, viſiting the Folds, I procure dry <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> reduc'd almoſt to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; (and which is to be had in almoſt every Country) or for want of that, I ſeek for Soil where Sheep have formerly been pent; than which, there is nothing better and more Soveraign for the <hi>Trees</hi> we ſpeak of. But in defect of this, I uſe either the Mould of well-rotted Leaves of <hi>Trees,</hi> or of an old <hi>Hot-Bed,</hi> that has not been over <hi>Sob'd</hi> and <hi>Water'd,</hi> without ever medling with the <hi>Marc,</hi> and <hi>Husks</hi> of <hi>Grapes</hi> for Reaſons I ſhall alledge hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Now (as I ſaid above) I would have the Mould which I prepare, weighty, and yet ſo looſe withal, as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ail not of producing good and ſubſtantial <hi>Roots,</hi> ſuch as it could not do in lighter <hi>Earth.</hi> On the other ſide, it being thus looſen'd, the Water and Refreſhments, together with the warmth of the <hi>Sun</hi> may the more eaſily penetrate it, than poſſibly it could, were it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Conſtipat</hi> and over-heavy. Conſidering then, how many <hi>Trees</hi> I have to <hi>In-Caſe,</hi> I accordingly order my <hi>Compoſition,</hi> by taking, at leaſt, one half of that Natural <hi>Earth</hi> which I find near at hand, (and which is that which gives it that weight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48210:236"/>
half of my <hi>Mixture,</hi> and imparts to it that lightneſs which I deſire. All this do I mingle together the very ſame day I have occaſion for it (if I could not diſpatch it ſome days before) not thinking it at all neceſſary to have prepar'd it much ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that which induces me is, Firſt, That every <hi>Particle</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> contains evidently in it ſelf, its peculiar <hi>Vegetative Salt.</hi> Secondly, 'Tis certain That no <hi>Grain,</hi> or <hi>Particle</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> does enter into the Body of another <hi>Grain,</hi> much leſs into the Bodies of the <hi>Roots,</hi> which only common Water does, which drenching (as I may ſay) the borrow'd <hi>Earth</hi> with the <hi>Salt</hi> of every part, receives more or leſs, according as the <hi>Earth</hi> is more or leſs charged with it: And this Water ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, and Seaſon'd with the <hi>Salts</hi> of thoſe good <hi>Earths,</hi> is that which (as we have often noted) adminiſters to the <hi>Roots</hi> that Food and Nouriſhment which forms their <hi>Sap,</hi> which we affirm will be found ſo much better, according as the <hi>Earths</hi> (through which the Water has drain'd) renders them more Fruitful, and above all leſs Diluted.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo, it follows, That the ſtaleneſs and oldneſs of the <hi>Compoſition,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more to its Melioration and Improvement, than the frequent ſtirring of it. On the contrary, methinks it were to be wiſh'd, that this <hi>Mixture,</hi> once made, and the <hi>Earths</hi> caſt into Heaps, were cover'd from the Rain, leſt the Waters falling upon them, waſh, and carry away the beſt part of it, and ſcatter it unprofitably about the ſides or bottom of the whole Maſs.</p>
                     <p>Now to make our <hi>Compoſition</hi> the more ſpeedily and eaſily, and indeed with more exactneſs; having firſt caſt all the <hi>Materials</hi> into ſeveral Heaps, pretty near to one another, I cauſe as many Men as there are different <hi>Ingredients,</hi> with their Shovels and Spades, ſtanding by their reſpective Heaps, to caſt it equally, and in equal <hi>Portions</hi> Pell-mell in ſome void place near them. For inſtance, If I have but one ſingle Heap of good <hi>Earth,</hi> and another of <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> there will need but two Men to fling them equally from their Heaps, to make another Heap: And if with the Heap of good <hi>Earth,</hi> I have two or three of thoſe other <hi>Ingredients</hi> mention'd, I place as many Labourers near that ſingle Heap of good <hi>Earth,</hi> as I do at all the other Heaps. And thus at one, and the ſame inſtant, as a Shovel-full of <hi>Stuff</hi> is thrown from each of the two or three ſeparated Heaps, there may (at the ſame time) be caſt as many Shovel-fulls of the ſingle Heap of good <hi>Earth:</hi> And ſo my <hi>Compoſition</hi> is ſoon finiſh'd, and made exactly, without loſing any time, or of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a greater quantity, or removing more <hi>Ingredients</hi> than one needs.</p>
                     <p>From that which has been ſaid, it appears, That I neither much look after the <hi>Earth</hi> of <hi>Drains,</hi> Dry and Old <hi>Rotted Dirt, Marſhy,</hi> or <hi>Caſtings</hi> of <hi>Ditches, Pidgeons-Dung</hi> and the like, as well becauſe I can be very well without them when I have the others which put me to no trouble in finding (the facility and eaſineſs in <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture</hi> being that which infinitely Charms me) as eſpecially, becauſe I eſteem them preferable, and much better, ſo as I never make uſe of the other when I can have theſe at hand, but upon the utmoſt Exigence and Neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>By this you alſo ſee, I do not <hi>Plant</hi> in pure and ſimple <hi>Earth</hi> only, and leſs yet in that which is finely Sifted, as do divers <hi>Gard'ners.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> will I confeſs, make pretty <hi>Shoots</hi> in this <hi>Powder'd-Mould</hi> for a year or two, but 'tis as true, that they make no <hi>Clod,</hi> or <hi>Union,</hi> ſo as 'tis very difficult to <hi>Caſe,</hi> or change them upon occaſion, without danger of leaving no Mould cleaving about the <hi>Roots;</hi> without which, you muſt look for nothing during that whole year, nor the next, but the dropping of their Leaves, whereas ſuch as are <hi>Planted</hi> in my <hi>Compoſition,</hi> retain a fair luſty <hi>Clod</hi> about them, from which one may (and as indeed one ſhould) pare off a good part when you <hi>Re-caſe</hi> them, ſo that as well the old <hi>Roots,</hi> as old and exhauſted <hi>Earth,</hi> may be ſufficiently abated, without any Peril of loſing the <hi>Leaves,</hi> or Riſquing the <hi>Tree,</hi> but, on the contrary, make it ſtronger, and more beautiful, and begin to put forth conſiderable <hi>Shoots</hi> that very year.</p>
                     <p>This alſo ſhews, how little I attribute to the <hi>Marc</hi> of <hi>Wine:</hi> And firſt, for that the Water which muſt retain the Taſt and Quality of Wine (as in effect it would, if the <hi>Marc</hi> contain'd in it any, the leaſt ſort of moiſture, the Water, I ſay, in which it were infus'd, participating of it) is really, not only improper, and not at all good for any kind of <hi>Plants,</hi> but extreamly pernicious to them. In the ſecond place, For that this <hi>Mare,</hi> conſiſting, as it does, of three things, which contain in them no ſort of Juice (namely, the Stone or Kirnel, the Skin, and the Stalk) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh nothing of advantage to <hi>Vegetation,</hi> for the Kirnels are commonly as hard as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stones, which ſcarce ever rot or turn to <hi>Earth;</hi> the Skin, and Stalks for having been extreamly preſs'd, can yield nothing at all of Nouriſhment. And all this we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48210:237"/>
find, in as much as the Water, wherein the <hi>Mares</hi> have been macerated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd a conſiderable while has no manner of Taſt or Reliſh in it; whereas the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which has percolated; and paſs'd through <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> or an old <hi>Melon-Bed,</hi> &amp;c. ſenſibly retains in it ſomething of extraordinary, as appears by the Acrimony or the Taſt it leaves,</p>
                     <p>To conclude, After all the Pains that I have taken, I never yet obſerv'd that the <hi>Mare</hi> of Wine did Impinguate, and Inrich the Ground; it renders it indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lighter (but without imparting to it any other Quality) and that's what I ſtrive chiefly to avoid in <hi>Earths</hi> for <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> not only becauſe I would not have a <hi>Mold</hi> too light, but above all, that what does give it the lightneſs requiſite, ſhould carry with it alſo ſomething of more Uſeful and Soveraign towards the Nouriſhment of <hi>Plants.</hi> Beſides, if the <hi>Mare</hi> of Wine were of that Abſolute Importance for <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> what ſhould they do, or rather what had they done, who having <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> live in colder Countries, where Vine-yards to not ſucceed or proſper?</p>
                     <p>Add to this, That as to the Moiſt and Colder <hi>Climates,</hi> and indeed other places alſo where the Soil is Churliſh and over Binding (approaching the Nature of Clay) the <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> ought to have good and ſufficient quantity of <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> or of thoſe other light, and tractable <hi>Ingredients,</hi> apt and diſpos'd to warm and heat; but which is not needful in hot, and more temporate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or in the good <hi>Earth</hi> of other places, ſo as on ſuch occaſions, one may go as far as two Thirds of <hi>Sheeps-Dung:</hi> And this laſt <hi>Compoſition</hi> is I aſſure you, very proper and good to raiſe any ſort of <hi>Plant</hi> in whatſoever, whether in <hi>Pot</hi> or <hi>Caſe.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>TOUCHING the firſt Article, we have this to ſay, That though it be true, that the Branches of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> in certain <hi>Climates</hi> (thoſe eſpecially which come in Bundles, will take Root of <hi>Suckers,</hi> as eaſily as with us <hi>Gooſe-berry, Fig,</hi> and <hi>Quince-Trees</hi> do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in theſe Countries here, where there is not that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, we ſeldom raiſe them but from the <hi>Seeds,</hi> and ſuch as we get from very Ripe, or Rotten <hi>Fruit:</hi> The Month of <hi>March</hi> is the proper time to Sow them, either in <hi>Earthen-Vaſes,</hi> or <hi>Caſes</hi> fill'd with <hi>Sheeps-Dung-Mold,</hi> or that of the old <hi>Melon-Bed,</hi> Burying what <hi>Seeds</hi> you intend to Sow, two or three Fingers deep, in Rills and Lines, or in Holes at two Inches diſtance, and at this nearneſs, that at the leaſt ſome of them may take, if not all, and with purpoſe to thin, and pull up Supernumeraries where they ſtand too thick, that thoſe which are left may thrive the better, as in a ſhort time they will do.</p>
                     <p>Preparatory to this Semination, chooſe of the beſt Species and Kinds of <hi>Oranges,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Bigarades,</hi> which will produce, and furniſh you with Wild <hi>Stocks,</hi> that in two years time may be fit to Re-plant at greater diſtance, and by this means ſo increaſe in Growth and Subſtance,, as that at the end of five or ſix Years (if care be taken to Dreſs them, either by frequent, but gentler ſtirrings of the <hi>Earth,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Watering, and diſcreetly Trimming and Pruning them) they will become fair and luſty <hi>Stocks</hi> fit to <hi>Graft</hi> on.</p>

                     <p>The main thing is, how to preſerve ſuch of either Kind as are well-condition'd: That the <hi>Stem</hi> be ſtrait, even and ſound, not gall'd any where, and of competent height, as about a Foot and a half, or from two Foot to a Yard, or four Foot; That the <hi>Roots</hi> be alſo ſound, and look as if but newly drawn out of the <hi>Nurſery:</hi> That the Cold, Wet, or too much Heat have not dried, chill'd, or any way injur'd them by the way; either of all which defects, may have utterly ſpoil'd them, and made them good for nothing. Theſe, and other Infirmities, you may eaſily diſcover by Cutting or Peeling a little of the <hi>Rind</hi> of the <hi>Stem, Branches</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> which ſhould be pretty firm and cloſe, and of a yellowiſh Green; the <hi>Bark</hi> alſo looſen'd a little from the Wood, ſhould be found of an Oily Moiſture, which is the Effect of the <hi>Sap's</hi> being plentifully in it. On the other ſide, if the <hi>Bark</hi> be too ſoft, or rather rotten, or very rough, hard and dry, they are Mortal Symptoms, and you'll commonly find the Wood underneath the <hi>Bark,</hi> to appear blackiſh and ſpotted, and ſuch are only fit for the Chimney.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe <hi>Trees</hi> which are brought us without the <hi>Earth,</hi> or any <hi>Clod</hi> about the <hi>Roots,</hi> and have yet perhaps other good Marks, are to be <hi>Trimm'd</hi> from <hi>Head</hi> to <hi>Foot:</hi> The <hi>Head,</hi> that is to ſay the <hi>Branches,</hi> being commonly Naked and Bare of Leaves, ſhould be ſufficiently <hi>Prun'd</hi> and <hi>Abated,</hi> and ſo order'd, that new <hi>Shoots</hi> may <hi>Spring</hi> from their <hi>Tops,</hi> fit to be form'd into beautiful, and handſom <hi>Heads,</hi> round and full, as we ſhall ſhew in due place.

                        </gap>nt of competent Nouriſhment, it being impoſſible a great <hi>Tree,</hi> together with all its <hi>Roots,</hi> ſhould find ſufficient to maintain Life in a Veſſel that contain'd but little Matter, whereas a little <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> in a great and large <hi>Caſe,</hi> would run no ſuch danger, but be in effect the ſame as if it had been Planted in the wide and open Field.</p>
                     <p>I am not of ſome Curious Mens Opinion, who hold that large and ample <hi>Caſes</hi> hinder the Growth, and Thriving of young <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> unleſs they alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they would grow and be worſe in the plain <hi>Earth,</hi> and open <hi>Field.</hi> 'Tis a great miſtake to think that a ſingle <hi>Root</hi> produces nothing of it ſelf; let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo throughly heated, it will never exert any thing, if it be not Animated with a certain <hi>Vital-Principle,</hi> as I have fully demonſtrated in one of the Chapters of my Treatiſe of Reflections. Now the Impreſſion which muſt promote this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſeems to proceed more Naturally from the Superficies than from the ſides.</p>
                     <p>What remains to be ſpoken concerning <hi>Caſes,</hi> is the <hi>Figure,</hi> which every body knows to be Square, for though they ſometimes make little Round ones, and other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48210:238"/>
Oblongiſh, they are not ſo agreeable, unleſs the height (without reckoning the Feet) correſpond, and anſwer the length; for to be large and low, or high, and but narrow, is very unſightly: The Foot ought therefore ordinarily, to be from five, to ſix Inches high, for <hi>Caſes,</hi> that are in height from one Foot and half, to two or three Feet. They may be ſome Inches ſhorter, if they be not above eight, ten, or twelve large; or be allow'd ſome Inches more, if of three and half, or four Feet, which are the largeſt Size we ſee any where us'd.</p>
                     <p>The beſt Timber to make <hi>Caſes</hi> of is Oak, as the moſt durable: Firr, Beech, Cheſnut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by no means proper. <hi>Caſes</hi> may alſo be made of Barrel-board, or Pipe-ſtaves, when they exceed not Twenty, or Two and Twenty Inches; but if more, of good Clap-board, and Wainſcot full Inch thick, they will elſe be apt to break, and be diſ-joynted when they come to be remov'd and carried by the <hi>Lever,</hi> eſpecially being large, full of Earth and heavy.</p>
                     <p>'Tis of great Importance to have their Feet of ſound Oak, and made Square, and Proportionable to the bigneſs of the <hi>Caſes:</hi> Alſo, that the Bottoms be very ſubſtantial, ſupported with Bars well Nail'd and faſten'd, that they may be able du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to ſuſtain their Burden, and ſecur'd from becoming Rotten, to which the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Waterings make them obnoxious: For it were deſirable that the <hi>Trees</hi> might continue in the ſame <hi>Caſes</hi> many Years without any neceſſity of Change, every Removing and Alteration being prejudicial to them. One ſhould likewiſe take Care, that the Bottoms of the <hi>Caſes</hi> hold ſtanch, and without ſtarting; and that they may laſt the longer, it were in my Opinion requiſite to give the Inſide a good Priming or two, with ſome Oil-Colour'd, no matter what it be. This may perhaps ſeem needleſs, but I aſſure you upon Experience, you'll find it worth the Expence in the durableneſs of your <hi>Caſes,</hi> and the benefit of the <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> which being thus accommodated will not need to be ſo often chang'd, provided you Govern them as I have ſhew'd, and that you <hi>In-Caſe</hi> them pretty high, and tread the <hi>Earth</hi> well at the bottom before you Re-plant them.</p>
                     <p>Every body knows that the bottom of the <hi>Caſe</hi> ſhould be bor'd through in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places with an Auger, if the Board be joyn'd cloſe, or elſe be laid at ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diſtance one from another, Bar-wiſe, for the more commodious draining, and paſſage of the ſuperfluous Water, and often Refreſhments.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Caſe</hi> or <hi>Box</hi> be of two Foot and halfSize, it were convenient to give it an Iron plate at each Corner, and under the Bars below, that the <hi>Levers</hi> (which you muſt of Neceſſity make uſe of, to Lift and Tranſport ſo great a Burden by) do not break any of the Bars. I would alſo Adviſe, that two of the ſides of the Boxes were contriv'd with Wickets, to open and ſhut at pleaſure, by the help of ſome Iron-Bars and Hooks, to hold them faſt in: Not that hereby one may give them an half <hi>In-Caſing</hi> upon occaſion, a thing I neither approve of or uſe (for Reaſons hereafter) but that when ever there really is need of <hi>Re-Incaſing</hi> large and great <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> one does the more eaſily take them forth their Old <hi>Caſe,</hi> with the greater part of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Clod</hi> adhering, which one cannot ſo commodiouſly and ſafely do otherwiſe, without danger of breaking and diſorder.

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>RE-CASING</hi> an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> is ſometimes Neceſſary, either for ſome defect in the <hi>Box,</hi> or in regard of the <hi>Tree:</hi> As Firſt, When a <hi>Box,</hi> or <hi>Caſe</hi> is ſo broken through Age or other Accidents, that it cannot be removed without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the <hi>Tree</hi> it contains; or when it is too little and has not ſufficient room to nouriſh, and entertain it in any longer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When one ſuſpects, or foreſees the Ruine of a <hi>Tree</hi> by the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Languor of the <hi>Shoots,</hi> the Yellowneſs of its <hi>Leaves,</hi> the ſmallneſs of the crumpled <hi>Flowers,</hi> &amp;c. Or that in fine, one of the moſt principal Perfections, and Beauty of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> being (in my Opinion) its yearly putting forth Luſty, and handſom new <hi>Shoots,</hi> if it have fail'd in ſo doing the laſt Spring, 'tis to be preſum'd there is ſomething in Fault, and that though it may haply bear a Florid, and Green Leaf of the laſt two Years, 'tis evident yet that it does no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48210:239"/>
more receive that due Nouriſhment in the <hi>Caſe</hi> which it requires: And therefore be it that the Mould is too Old, and much exhauſted, or the Box too narrow in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the quantity of the <hi>Roots,</hi> on either of theſe defects, a new <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> is to be reſolv'd on.</p>
                     <p>Happy thoſe <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> or rather Happy the Maſter of them, that has an able and Skillful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> to Govern 'em, and the Sagacity to prevent theſe Accidents, by a timely <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> before his <hi>Trees</hi> complain or ſuffer; being careful to do it before theſe Infirmities ſeize too far upon them, and perform it dextrouſly with all the neceſſary circumſtances: He may then in the firſt place, be ſure his <hi>Trees</hi> will regularly maintain their <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Verdure,</hi> which is no ſmall Maſter-piece; and in the ſecond place, find them to ſhoot (that very year) almoſt as freely as if they had not at all been <hi>New-Cas'd,</hi> which is another extraordinary advantage. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Suppoſing it to have already attain'd as beautiful an Head as we have fancied in our Idea, there will be no farther need of Working upon that, or uſing the Knife, though haply it may be convenient to pare away, and abate about two third parts of the <hi>Clod</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> which is about the <hi>Root;</hi> and thus have you an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> perfectly well <hi>Re-Cas'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore very neceſſary to <hi>Re-Caſe</hi> (though the Tree may have been never ſo well Treated) whenever we obſerve it to have paſs'd a Summer without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to make as vigorous a ſhoot as 'twas wont to do; ſince being neglected, until we find our Trees actually ſick, and in an ill condition, one may aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that either the ſame year, or the next after, they'll in all probability loſe their Leaves, and that the very year of <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> they will make no ſhoot at all, or if they do put any out, none but ſuch as are very feeble, wretched and miſerable ones, with ſmall round Flowers, moſt of which will drop before they be ſpent or wither'd; ſo as of neceſſity, you will be oblig'd to cut off a very great part of the old Branches, and ſometimes the entire Head, to ones infinite vexation, to behold the poor Trees in this ſad and naked condition, and that for ſo long a time before they will recover, or afford you any ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>It is fit you ſhould have notice, that ſometimes a <hi>Caſed Orange-Tree</hi> (be it one brought from hot Countries, or that has only been newly chang'd into another Box) may now and then remain two, or three years without puſhing either Roots or Branches, whatever pains one takes about it, which is very irkſome: But even in this caſe, one is not preſently to deſpair of the Tree, or caſt it away, ſeeing ſo long as the Stem and Branches continue freſh, you may be ſure it is alive, and may for all this Emerge. Nor will I adviſe you to change its <hi>Caſe,</hi> but to continue your wonted care of him as he ſtands, and you'll after a while find him to Recover, and anſwer all your Pains and Patience, it familiarly happening, that this Lethargie and Benumb'neſs (from I know not what unknown and ſecret Cauſe) is at laſt vanquiſh'd and overcome: But where an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> that (for inſtance) has been <hi>In-Cas'd,</hi> and diligently Dreſs'd for three or four years, ceafes for a whole Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month to Spring at all, you may (as already we have noted) conclude that he is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be Sick, and ſpeedily <hi>Re-Caſe</hi> him the next year following. To perform this well, you ſhall firſt of all pare off two Thirds of the Old <hi>Mould</hi> or <hi>Clod,</hi> which indeed looks very frightful at firſt to thoſe who are yet unacquainted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Caſed</hi> Trees: Though it be indiſpenſably neceſſary at every <hi>Re-Caſing,</hi> eſpecially if the Tree have been in the ſame Box four or five years, or perhaps a a longer time; for 'tis ſometimes expedient to diminiſh, and take away a full half of its <hi>Clod;</hi> as when through the negligence, or imprudence of former <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> you find a Tree become exceſſively Groſs and Over-grown, for want of being duly Prun'd and Trimm'd on its precedent <hi>Re-Caſings.</hi> The ſecond thing to be done in <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> well, is before you begin this Important Work: In the firſt place to conſider the Mould and Earth of the <hi>Clod:</hi> In the next, to ſee what condition the <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Box</hi> is in. As for the Mould, if you find it over light, and that you conceive the Root has but a ſmall <hi>Clod</hi> about it, you muſt then Water it plentifully the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſtir any thing, that ſo the Moiſture may cauſe it to adhere to the Roots, leaſt otherwiſe the Earth fall wholly away from them, leaving them quite Naked when you come to take the Tree out of its <hi>Caſe;</hi> but if you perceive the Earth to be ſolid and material, ſo as in likelihood the Root has a ſufficient <hi>Clod</hi> about it, you may altogether omit the previous Watering, and proceed to <hi>Un-Caſe:</hi> The Earth will hold well enough to the Roots, and you may Work without any danger.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Box,</hi> you were before to conſider, whether it be fit to ſerve any more; and if ſo, to Reſerve it: If not, to diſpoſe of it accordingly. Now for the ſaving
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48210:239"/>
of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> be it with a Wicket, or (as ordinarily) without any, you ſhould with ſome fitting Inſtrument, Howe, or Trowel ſcrape, and take away from about the Roots <hi>Clod</hi> and all the four ſides of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> as much old Earth as until you can conveniently arrive at the <hi>Clod;</hi> and then alſo, pare off as much of the ancient <hi>Roots</hi> as you can without diſordering of the <hi>Clod,</hi> of which you ſhould leave three parts. This is a neceſſary Operation for the cleanſing of it quite round, which otherwiſe you would not be able to reach and come at. This done, lift the Tree out of the <hi>Caſe</hi> with either ſtrength of Arm, if it be not too heavy, or by the help of a Crane, Pully, and Ropes if it be of too great a bulk; and ſo without demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing any part of the Old <hi>Caſe,</hi> you may keep or make uſe of it again, either to <hi>Re-Caſe</hi> the ſame Tree in, or ſome other, whilſt the former, with ſome ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, may laſt perhaps four or five years longer: But if you find it not worth the mending, let it be broken up for the Fire, and ſo you ſhall come to the intire <hi>Clod,</hi> and as before, abating about two Thirds, or more of the Mould as you ſee cauſe, ſince in either reſpect, Retrenchments are to be made as well on every of the four ſides, as underneath, ſcraping away ſo much of the old Exhauſted Earth, as till you diſcover, and lay bare about two Inches of the ends of the Roots that had been Cut, to be Reveſted and turniſh'd in <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> with new and freſh Mould (as ſhall hereafter be ſhown) that ſo they may at their Extremities, put forth new and luſty Roots, ſufficiently to Re-eſtabliſh the Tree.</p>
                     <p>By the way, I Advertiſe, that in <hi>Pruning</hi> the Roots, which you will find twiſted and intangled one within the other, you be careful to take clean away all that you Cut off, without leaving ſo much as a Fragment, or Chip remaining, thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Rotting, and Infecting of their Neighbours, which were very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. In a word, after theſe Retrenchments made of Earth and Roots, if the Weight and Bulk of Earth permit, I Counſel you to dip it in ſome Tub, or Veſſel full of Water or Fountain Baſin, deep enough to cover the intire <hi>Clod,</hi> and there to let it remain as long as the Water Works and Boils about it; for ſo it will, ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by degrees, where the ordinary Waterings could not penetrate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Earth exceſſively dry'd, and Water taking place, will force out and expel the latent, and prejudicial Air which cauſes the Ebullition and Diſorder.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Boiling ceaſes, take the drenched Tree out of the Water, and placing it on ſome <hi>Block</hi> or <hi>Caſe</hi> laid ſide-long (or any thing that ſtands a little higher than the Ground) there let it reſt until all the Water be drain'd from it, and it have almoſt quite done dropping: For this Reaſon, That whilſt the <hi>Clod</hi> is thus ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould one put it into a new Earth'd <hi>Caſe,</hi> it would make it all into a Mortar, which were very pernicious to the Tree; for being neceſſarily oblig'd to preſs, and cloſe the Mould to the ſides of the <hi>Clod,</hi> and crowd as much into the <hi>Caſe</hi> as is poſſible, as well about the Naked Roots, as where ever one finds a void, it could not be, but the Earth thus moiſten'd, beaten and preſs'd would turn all to pap and Mortar, which would at laſt grow hard, and petrifie like Stone, by all means to be prevented.</p>
                     <p>Now in caſe the <hi>Clod</hi> be too big to be thus plung'd in Water: When the <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> is finiſh'd, with a good big pointed Stake (made of ſome hard Wood) or an Iron Crow or Pin made for the purpoſe; endeavour to pierce the <hi>Clod</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of it, and pour Water in the holes gently from time to time, as long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as it will imbibe any, and that you judge the whole Maſs of Earth may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be ſoak'd with it.</p>
                     <p>Let us next proceed to fit our new <hi>Caſe,</hi> be it of the ſmaller, middle, or largeſt ſize: The Cuſtom is, and 'tis a very good one, both for the benefit of the <hi>Roots,</hi> as for the preſervation of the <hi>Caſes</hi> bottom, to cover them with a Bed of Rubbiſh, old Brick-Bats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the frequent Waterings draining through thoſe looſe Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, may not Stagnate and Corrupt, which would both Rot the <hi>Roots,</hi> and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the <hi>Caſes</hi> alſo. I would have this Rubbiſh handſomly rang'd, pretty groſs and thick, ſuitable to the bigneſs and capacity of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> yet not to lye above three or four Inches thick, the leaſt ſiz'd <hi>Boxes</hi> two.</p>
                     <p>This done, 'tis ſufficient to fill in as much prepar'd Earth as is requiſite to ſet the <hi>Clod</hi> in, ſo as the Superficies be plac'd level with the brim of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> and then finiſh all, gently filling the void places at the ſides, and give it all a plentiful Watering: So have you the true ordinary way of <hi>In-Caſing</hi> all ſorts of Trees.</p>
                     <p>But, for as much as I perceive that by this manner of putting in the Mould, 'tis apt to ſink, and ſettle too much after a little while, and conſequently cauſe the <hi>Roots</hi> quickly to touch the bottoms of the <hi>Caſes,</hi> which may extreamly prejudice the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48210:240"/>
Beauty of <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> make them look Yellow, put forth ſmall <hi>Shoots</hi> and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſoon deſpoil them of their Leaves, and ſo oblige one to change the <hi>Caſes</hi> every four, or five Years. I have conſider'd the doing ſomething more, which has very well ſucceeded with them, though I confeſs upon this account I have ſtirr'd up againſt me a great many among the <hi>Orangiſt-Gard'ners,</hi> who upon this, as well as my <hi>Compoſition</hi> and <hi>Mixture</hi> of Earth, have looked on me as an <hi>Innovator,</hi> and as one may ſay, a Diſturber of the Publick Peace, and as if I had at the ſame time Diſhonour'd both them and their Anceſtors: But let the Succeſs of my Method decide the Proceſs, to the Confuſion of the Envious.</p>
                     <p>See then how I <hi>Re-Caſe</hi> my Trees: So ſoon as I have laid upon the Bed of Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh a Foot of the prepar'd Earth, which I would have to be dry, or very little moiſt, I cauſe it to be exceedingly beaten with the Fiſt, or with ſome Rammer, or piece of Wood when it is for the leſſer <hi>Caſes;</hi> or elſe make one to go into the bigger <hi>Caſes,</hi> and tread the Mould ſufficiently, ſo as it may ſubſide, and ſettle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt once for all, whilſt the weight of the Earth, and agitation of its Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would in time by the common Method, ſhake the <hi>Clod</hi> down to the very Rubbiſh, and bottom of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> to the great Damage of the Tree, which I would by all means prevent, as I have already ſhew'd.</p>
                     <p>And ſince my purpoſe is, Firſt, That in <hi>Re-Caſing,</hi> the Superficies or upper part of the <hi>Clod</hi> ſhould exceed the Brim of the <hi>Box</hi> three or four Inches, as certainly knowing that notwithſtanding all the Treading and Ramming, the <hi>Clod</hi> will in leſs than three or four Years, be ſo ſunk down, as to be no higher than the Edge of the <hi>Caſe</hi> (as it happens at the firſt in the ordinary way above deſcribed) though the bottom of the <hi>Clod</hi> be well enough plac'd: And, ſince alſo I would that the <hi>Clod</hi> ſhould meet, and touch three or four Inches of the well-looſen'd Mould, into which the naked <hi>Roots</hi> may commodiouſly enter and inſinuate themſelves. Upon theſe two Conſiderations I govern my ſelf, as well for the due Repleniſhing the <hi>Caſe</hi> with Earth, to the place where it touches the bottom of the <hi>Clod,</hi> as for the well Ramming and Treading of it, as by degrees (and Bed upon Bed) I caſt it in, 'til the whole <hi>Caſe</hi> be full within three or four Inches of the top, which ſhould remain looſe, and not be Trodden at all.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe Precautions, I ſo Plant my <hi>Clod,</hi> as that its Stem be juſt in the Center of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> and ſtand exactly upright. To do which, you ſhall draw Diagonal Lines from Corner to Corner; by the Decuſſation of which, you cannot fail of placing it Accurately in the middle. Then for Repleniſhing the void places about the <hi>Clod</hi> to the height of its Superficies, I uſe to cram and preſs in of the prepar'd Mould (as much as is needful) with the end of a little piece of Wood or Barrel Board, which forces and crowds the Earth in ſo very hard, as from that very day forward, ſettles the Tree, without looſing its Perpendicular, and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes it againſt all ordinary Winds, Motions, or Tranſportings of the <hi>Caſes</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>Now to keep the Earth (which I Adviſe ſhould conſiderably exceed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of the <hi>Caſe)</hi> from ſliding down, eſpecially, that when you refreſh it, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter run not down unprofitably by the ſides, I order pieces of Boards of four or five Inches breadth, be applied to all the four ſides of the <hi>Caſes,</hi> ſinking and preſſing in one of the Edges of the Boards between the Earth and the ſide of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> to <note place="margin">Mettre des hauſſes.</note> keep up the Mould ſo heaped above the Level of the <hi>Caſes</hi> brims: Nor is this any great Eye-ſore, provided the Boards be handſomly plac'd, which otherwiſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it would be; but however, 'tis neceſſary to be done, the benefit and uſe eaſily reconciles one to the Cuſtom, as well as its being to continue but a few Years, for ſo ſoon as the <hi>Clod</hi> is once deſcended as low as it ſhould go, they ſignifie nothing, and you may take them away.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Tree and ſide Boards plac'd in this Order, I make a ſmall Circle of three or four Fingers deep in the upper Earth, 'twixt the Extremities of the <hi>Clod</hi> and this new looſe Mould, and then by degrees, pouring Water into the Channel, and Refreſhing it plentifully, the Mould by this time cloſed to the ends of the new cut <hi>Roots,</hi> will ſoon diſpoſe them to exerciſe their Function, which is to produce new ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall in the next Chapter ſpeak concerning what other Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Refreſhments are to be given after this firſt.</p>
                     <p>One thing I muſt not forget, That inſtead of <hi>Caſes,</hi> they often make uſe of <hi>Vaſas,</hi> and <hi>Earthen-Pots;</hi> and many now a-days would perſwade us, that certain <hi>Vaſas</hi> of a peculiar Fabrick, are incomparably better than <hi>Caſes</hi> and <hi>Boxes:</hi> In the mean time, I am not of that Opinion, ſince by long Experience, we all find the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48210:240"/>
many Conveniences of <hi>Caſes,</hi> and the great Inconvenience of <hi>Pots.</hi> I confeſs <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Vaſas</hi> may be proper enough for ordinary <hi>Trees,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of the new Make, ſeeing beſides that they are very Beautiful, both for their Shape and fine Paintings; they are alſo capable of Earth enough (for ſome time at leaſt) for thoſe leſs Curious ſorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> without needing ſo great, and ſo frequent Waterings, which I do not Approve of, nor of ſuch often Changes, which I like as little. But for great and well-grown Trees, abounding in <hi>Roots,</hi> and diſpos'd to Increaſe them with new ones, when they are well Planted, I do not think <hi>Vaſas</hi> (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made of Capacity to furniſh ſufficient Matter, and maintain them well any conſiderable time) can be ſo proper, and convenient, as are our ordinary <hi>Caſes.</hi> Concerning the Inconvenience of the Uſe of <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Vaſas:</hi> Trees that have am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and goodly Heads, ought to be ſo ſteadily plac'd, and at large, as to be able to reſiſt the Impetuoſity of the Winds, which <hi>Vaſas</hi> do not afford them, whoſe ſlight, and narrow Feet, commonly make them ſubject to be over-thrown, and conſequently ſpoil'd, beſides their fragility and brittleneſs; ſuch Trees are therefore in continual danger of unexpected <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> upon all ſuch Accidents.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, without entring farther into this Controverſie, upon any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Account, in favour of <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Vaſas;</hi> and eſpecially, upon the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain. <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> (which I do not at all Comprehend) I am ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd, that generally ſpeaking, this Novel Mode, is none of the beſt, and that <hi>Caſes</hi> are much to be preferr'd, and a thouſand times better for Service, and more Commodious, though there go about of late, certain Manuſcripts, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to turn our Uſe of <hi>Caſes</hi> to Ridicule.</p>

                        <p>Of <hi>Watering:</hi> Its Uſe and Way of Applying it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Come now to the Uſe and Manner of ordinary <hi>Watering</hi> and Refreſhing of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> either during <hi>Winter</hi> in the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> or particularly in <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-</hi>time whilſt they ſtand Abroad: And the Difficulty is in my Opinion great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it appears at firſt, for as if it were of little Importance, moſt of our <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> perſwaded of the great Neceſſity of it, but unwilling to take the pains of fetching the Water, leave it for the moſt part to the moſt Ignorant of their Boys and Drudges, and think it well, ſo their Trees be often and ſoundly Drench'd; that is to ſay, Three or four times a Week, and ſometimes more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and that ſo profuſely, as that it Streams out at the bottom of the <hi>Caſes</hi> in that abundance, that the Neighbour places where they ſtand, are commonly all in a Puddle, and unacceſſible.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge that theſe <hi>Gard'ners</hi> have good Reaſon to <hi>Water</hi> well, becauſe of the lightneſs of the Mould they uſe for <hi>In-Caſings:</hi> That is, having (as I reckon) committed an Error at firſt, through Ignorance, they think of mending it by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; which, whatever be the Fault, (conſider'd in it ſelf) hinders for a time, the firſt from being as pernicious as it would have been without a ſecond.</p>
                     <p>For my own particular, I am extreamly ſcrupulous, and ſparing as to point of <hi>Waterings;</hi> not that I totally forbid it, it being of ſo Abſolute Neceſſity, eſpecially during the great and extraordinary Drouths and Heats of <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Roots</hi> are (as one may ſay) more Animated than in the former Months: Beſides, that they be then moſt Stirring and Active, it being the Seaſon of their <hi>Flowering,</hi> and putting out new <hi>Shoots,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſhould not Counſel you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive reiterated, or over frequent <hi>Waterings,</hi> excepting it be during thoſe Months above-mention'd, as being the moſt Important, and Conſiderable for <hi>Vegetation;</hi> when yet it will be ſufficient to beſtow on them two good Weekly <hi>Waterings,</hi> and no more. I ſtint it to that number, becauſe I certainly know, that in the fat and ſluggiſh Earth I make uſe of, there is no ſuch great occaſion for great and frequent Refreſhings, and that it would be extreamly prejudicial to the Trees that receive them; and expect withal, that we ſhall ſee conſiderable Change, in the Common Uſe of great, and often <hi>Waterings,</hi> if one would apply them in the Ancient <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of <hi>Moulds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48210:241"/>
Certain it is, that Earths which are light, and which (as they ſpeak) have little or no Body and Conſiſtence, coming to be Watred in any ſort, will hardly retain ſufficient Moiſture for any time, as indeed they ſhould: On the contrary, they quickly become dry, by reaſon of the eaſie paſſage which the Water finds, as well through the looſe Mould, as through the very <hi>Caſes,</hi> and ſo the Trees not finding their <hi>Roots</hi> ſufficiently Refreſh'd (of which they have now moſt need, to ſet them in motion) are ſubject to pine away and wither, unleſs they be plied with Water. In ſuch kind of Earth therefore, 'tis indiſpenſably neceſſary to repeat it; but, as 'tis only want of Moiſture, which makes them dwindle thus, ſo thoſe Earths which we have deſcrib'd above, being of Conſiſtence naturally to retain their Moiſture, and continue Freſh, how little ſoever you <hi>Water</hi> them, will preſerve the Trees from that Infirmity, and enable them to exert their Genuine Activity, in ſending forth good <hi>Roots,</hi> and conſequently fair <hi>Shoots,</hi> large and ample Leaves, and beautiful Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, maintain themſelves in perfect Health, without needing ſuch abundant, and continual <hi>Waterings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Rules which I follow as to <hi>Waterings,</hi> concern firſt of all, that which is given immediately either after their being put into the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> or at their bringing out. And ſecondly, thoſe Refreſhings which are given during all the time that <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> ſtand abroad, ſome of theſe <hi>Waterings</hi> I make to be great, others mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate: Thoſe I call great, when pouring Water on the Earth, it drop out at the bottom of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> but ſo as it be very little or nothing; and ſuch <hi>Waterings</hi> are profitable, provided one uſe them not too often. Thoſe I call Moderate, which I caſt on to Refreſh the <hi>Surface-Clod</hi> only, and maintain the Moiſture that has been conſum'd, as well by the Heat, and Dryneſs of the Air, as by the Attraction of the <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Refreſhings which are given immediately after they are ſet into the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> I would beſtow a plentiful one, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> are placed where they muſt ſtand during all the time of their Confinement; and that which Juſtifies it, is, The neceſſary Cloſing of the Mould about the <hi>Roots,</hi> which in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, the ſhaking, and agitation of the Stem, may have ſeparated both from it and the <hi>Roots,</hi> letting the Air into the void places, which would prove an invincible obſtacle to their Action, which (as we have often noted) never move or thrive in any <hi>Plant,</hi> ſave when the <hi>Roots,</hi> and the moiſt Earth, immediately unite, which is effected by a good <hi>Watering,</hi> and prevents the diſorder one is to apprehend, when a Tree is Diſabl'd from Acting according to its Nature.</p>
                     <p>Having finiſh'd this great Refreſhment of our Cloiſter'd <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> I hardly give them any more, unleſs it be very ſparingly at the entrance and expiration of <hi>April,</hi> when the Seaſon growing mild, the Inclos'd Trees themſelves become ſenſible of it; and then one ſhould not fail of ſetting open the Doors and Windows of the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> often, ſo as the Heat of the Sun augmenting by degrees, its Beams, or the newly warmed Air at leaſt, qualifying the Room, the Earth about the Trees becomes a little more thirſty, and being heated, urges the <hi>Roots</hi> to begin to <hi>Shoot</hi> and <hi>Quicken</hi> apace. I ſay, Quicken and Augment their Motion; for 'tis certain, (as I have elſewhere ſhew'd) <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as well as all other <hi>Verdures,</hi> are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Action, and that in the very Houſe, elſe would both their Fruits, and Leaves infallibly drop off, as being only preſerv'd, and faſtned to them by Vertue of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which continually maintains, and gives them Nouriſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, theſe <hi>Plants</hi> do Act and Move leſs ſome time than in another; that is, more ſlowly in Winter than in Summer, when the Sun (which is the Parent of all things Living) favours them with his benign Influence: But excepting only this Month of <hi>April,</hi> I totally ceaſe from <hi>Watering</hi> all the Winter long; and in this I ſay nothing New, all diſcreet <hi>Gardners</hi> obſerve it, and very rarely give I any Water at the beginning even of <hi>May,</hi> becauſe its approaching ſo near the time of freeing the Trees from their long Confinement, I ſee no Neceſſity of making the <hi>Caſes</hi> heavier by <hi>Watering,</hi> which one ſhall find weighty enough already, and ſufficiently difficult to T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By the way, I make no reckoning at all of certain <hi>Caſts</hi> and <hi>Sproutings,</hi> which ſome <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> now and then puſh out during Winter; nor in truth are they good, as appears by the withering of their Tops, and falling of the Leaves; ſo as inſtead of its perſwading me thoſe Trees ſhould be <hi>Water'd,</hi> that they may make better <hi>Shoots,</hi> I rather pull them quite off, as ſuperfluous, and good for nothing, but unprofitably to avert the <hi>Sap</hi> from the other more ſubſtantial <hi>Parts, Branches</hi> and <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage,</hi> which it ſhould Augment and Fortifie.</p>

The Work I would have beſtow'd about <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> whilſt they are <hi>inclos'd,</hi> in order to their neceſſary Politeneſs, is to finiſh the making them clean from the Filth and Ordure, which the <hi>Punaiſes</hi> and <hi>Buggs</hi> have left behind, and that has not yet been well taken away; and that if any may here or there ſeem to wither, a little Water be given to it, but in very little quantity, ſince it proceeds only from ſome of the Superficial Roots that ſuffer, for the Water which was given upon their firſt Conſinement, has doubtleſs Conſerv'd the Body of the Tree, and bottom of the <hi>Clod</hi> ſufficiently Moiſt: Since having not yet undergon any ſuch ſcorching heats of the <hi>Sun</hi> as was able to dry them up, they can ſuffer no ſuch exceſſive Thirſt, and therefore a very ſmall Refreſhing will ſoon revive the drooping Leaves. As for thoſe which ſtand ſound and vigorous in the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> maintaining their Leaves freſh, large, upright and open, they are only to be look'd on and admir'd.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid concerning <hi>Watering</hi> Confined <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (and that with greater rigour and exactneſs) of the <hi>Watering</hi> of all Trees and Shrubs that are their Fellow-Priſoners; ſuch as <hi>Jeſſimines, Granads,</hi> &amp;c. the over-frequent <hi>Waterings</hi> ſpoiling their Roots, and injuring the Trees; and beſides they Naturally are not ſo Active as <hi>Orange, Lemon,</hi> and <hi>Myrtle-Trees,</hi> theſe latter ſort giving Indications for moſt part, by the ſaint and pallid Complexion of the Leaves, when they ſtand in need of a little Refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>I would moreover for all ſorts of <hi>Cas'd-Trees,</hi> whether in the Houſe or Abroad, that the upmoſt Earth ſhould be always kept looſe, and appear as if newly ſtirr'd; ſince beſides, this ſlight motion yields a marvellous Relief and Succour, by facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the penetration of the Refreſhments you give them, and ſhews very handſomly to the Eye, whilſt the Chap'd, Cloven, and Cruſty Surface is as unſightly, I would therefore have it alſo a little ſprinkled.</p>
                     <p>We come now laſtly to <hi>Waterings</hi> abroad out of the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> as being in truth that which requires a great deal of Diſcretion, and in which methinks they commonly moſt fail.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon therefore as you bring forth your Trees, and have Rang'd them in the Stations where they are to continue, beſtow upon them as plentiful a <hi>Watering</hi> as you were Advis'd to do when firſt you Hous'd them: I ſay, let this be a thorough and bountiful Refreſhment; which to do effectually, make ſeveral holes in the Earth with ſome Iron-Pin, or Stake of hard Wood, but withal ſo cautiouſly, as not to gall any of the Roots: By this expedient the Water will viſit every part of the <hi>Clod</hi> as 'tis neceſſary it ſhould.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this firſt plentiful <hi>Watering,</hi> I allow them alſo two conſiderable ones more every Week, ſo long as I ſee the Trees to Flower and Spring; namely in the Months of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and conſequently (if the Seaſon prove very hot and dry) to Mid-<hi>October,</hi> when they are to be Hous'd, and which ſome, Trees will themſelves Advertiſe you of, by the crumpling, half cloſing, and hanging down of their flaccid Leaves, giving notice that they want Refreſhment, as you'll alſo find if you thruſt your Hand a little down into the Earth by its being dry. I would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe every Ten days, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thereabouts, order them a conſiderable Refreſhing, and ſometimes a ſecond moderate one, eſpecially in <hi>Auguſt</hi> when commonly <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> make new Shoots, ſo as you do not repeat it in caſe the Mould be moiſt enough already, for 'tis not always the dryneſs of the Earth which cauſes the Leaves to wither, they faint oftentimes before a following Tempeſt, or that the Tree be not well Eſtabliſh'd, is looſe in the Roots, or too much expos'd to the <hi>Sun.</hi> In ſuch caſes you are ever to Examine of what Temper the Earth is, dry or moiſt, and accordingly to Govern the <hi>Waterings.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, every body finds that ſome ſort of Trees will always look faint and ſickly, whatever boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Waterings</hi> you beſtow upon them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very certain as to this particular, I have often obſerv'd two things: Firſt, That when ſome <hi>Gard'ners</hi> have Command of Water, they are commonly apt to over Water their <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> either themſelves or by their Servants. And in the ſecond place, Some extreamly neglect to do it, and give them not ſufficient, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where it requires pains to fetch the Water, Lazineſs or ill Cuſtom carrying them to theſe Extreams. 'Tis I ſay moſt certain, that as to the firſt of theſe two Caſes, I would not they ſhould exceed very moderate Refreſhments, finding that they commonly give them too much: And to the ſecond quite the contrary, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To allow them a thorough <hi>Watering,</hi> leſt being to take pains to fetch the Water, they afford them not enough. I very well know that diſcreet <hi>Gard'ners</hi> need none of theſe Steppoſite Documents; however, that I may Reconcile them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48210:242"/>
I adhere to my former Opinion, ſuppoſing the Earth to be mingled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Method; That regularly <hi>Watering</hi> twice a Week, at certain times (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during the hot Seaſons, the time of Flowring, and pride of Shooting, and ever obſerving a Mediocrity between two great ones, and Refreſhing them every eight or ten days only at other times) you will find your Trees in excellent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to their <hi>Waterings:</hi> To which add, That <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> have this of Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to what concerns their Drink, and in which they almoſt reſemble Men that are Wiſe, That as they ſeldom call for it but when they have Need and are Thirſty; to urge them when they do not require it, inſtead of doing them a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs one does but incommode them. In like manner <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> ſometimes of themſelves give notice when they have need of being Refreſh'd; ſo as we certainly do them injury when we Water them out of Seaſon, whereas we do them good in Refreſhing them when their Leaves becoming lank, and wrap'd together call for help, and give Symptoms that the <hi>Root</hi> is Languiſhing for want of Moiſture. But that which juſtifies the Compariſon farther is, That a Prudent and Skilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> is never to wait for the Signal from his <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> when he ſhould do his Duty, but that when ever he perceives or ſuſpects it (if he be not miſtaken) he be ſure to apply the proper Remedy according to our Preſcription; but as there are both good and wholſom Refreſhments, there are likewiſe very evil and pernicious ones too. Concerning which I ſhall declare what I think, with that Moderation I judge moſt convenient.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Inconveniences which happen to <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as well from <hi>Over-Waterings</hi> as from the <hi>Fire</hi> which is made in <hi>Green-Houſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>'TIS eaſily perceiv'd, that when too much Water is given <hi>Cas'd Orange-Trees,</hi> there uſually enſue two great Diſorders; and as remarkable it is, that one is not ſenſible of the Evil when it firſt begins, but the conſequence makes us feel it at laſt, when 'tis too late for Remedy.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Diſorder conſiſtsin this, That thoſe unreaſonable and frequent Summer-<hi>Watering</hi> Accuſtoming (as one may ſay) the Trees to a Courſe of Life which though Inconvenient, would nevertheleſs enable them to ſubſiſt, were it to be continued all the Winter long: Their being ſo eaſily inur'd to all ſorts of Nouriſhment, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them this ſingular Advantage. But ſince we find that ſuch <hi>Waterings</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mortal to them when the cold Weather comes, we ought to be very ſparing, though to avoid one danger (which in effect is of all other the greateſt) we are apt to fall into another which is not without its great Inconvenience, namely, That of an every Years loſs of Leaves. Now one cannot Reflect on an Accident ſo ungrateful, without concluding it to proceed from the <hi>Roots</hi> not receiving that due Nouriſhment during the ſeven previous Months of their Confinement, which they us'd to have the five former Months abroad, which needs muſt check and put a ſtop to their Natural Activity. This doubtleſs is the Cauſe that the Leaves finding themſelves deſtitute of that perpetual ſupply of Sap which then they need, are forc'd to forſake the Branches, which Naturally and from their Birth produc'd them: And ſo not well underſtanding from what ſource this Evil proceeds we make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Erroneous Conjectures, and have recourſe to other things which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have not at all Contributed to it, always ſuppoſing that the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> be not in fault.</p>
                     <p>In the next place (and which indeed is the moſt Important) ſince the Nature and Quality of the <hi>Shoots</hi> intirely depend upon the Quality of the <hi>Roots,</hi> and theſe particularly upon that of Nouriſhment. 'Tis certain, That when this is peccant and feeble, the New-born <hi>Roots</hi> muſt needs be weak and feeble alſo, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the Sap which they prepare being of an ill Conſtitution, the <hi>Shoots</hi> themſelves which they produce muſt needs be ſhort and weak, alſo the Leaves ſinall, limber, and often Yellow. Hence it comes to paſs, that theſe <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> which for want of ſufficient Nouriſhment during Summer are already fall'n Sick, finiſh (as I may ſay) their Languiſhing and Miſery, ſo ſoon as the Cold (which above all things they dread) aſſaults them: The main Principle of their Natural Strength and Vigour, may poſſibly have enabled them to reſiſt and ſtruggle for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48210:242"/>
ſome time againſt the Miſchief to which their ill <hi>Culture</hi> has reduc'd them, but when once this little Stock comes to be ſpent and exhauſted (as at length it will be) they pine ſo miſerably, that for ſome years after one ſhall be hardly able to Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and perhaps at laſt without Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſaid (and may not improperly repeat here) that it is not from the Material Subſtance of the Earth the <hi>Roots</hi> Elaborate and Compoſe the Sap, adminiſtring Nouriſhment to all the parts of the Tree; it is the Water only, which percolating through the Ground, is Impregnat with part of its Salt, or ſome other qualities wherewith the Earth was endowed: So as if this Earth, whoſe Salt doubtleſs is not Inexhauſtible and without end, comes once to be over-diluted by great and frequent Waſhings, it muſt needs at laſt be quite robb'd and depriv'd of all its Salure, and within a ſhort time after, the <hi>Roots</hi> finding no more of it in the Water which moiſtens the Earth, or but very little, they can produce no more new <hi>Shoots</hi> worth any thing; and conſequently, neither any good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Sap, Branch, Leaves, or Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as doubtleſs they would do in better Mould moderately moiſten'd and refreſh'd. Whence I conclude (and I think with Reaſon) That to Water Trees to the purpoſe, requires more Skill and Prudence than uſually appears in the ordinary Conduct of moſt <hi>Gard'ners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, by the uſe of Fire which moſt of them affect to make in the <hi>Green-Houſe, Orange</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees</hi> fall into other very pernicious Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as by long Experience I have Learn'd. The Reaſon is evident, The Fire is either too great or too ſmall. If the latter, the Heat can only affect thoſe <hi>Plants</hi> which are very near it, without any Influence on the farther diſtant. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If you make it below, and (as commonly they practice it) in ſeveral places of the Room, neither the Heads (of any height) nor oppoſite ſides of ſuch as ſtand not near, are ſenſible of it; and in caſe you make it higher, the under Branches receive no comfort by it. Thus granting it may do ſome good, which I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, 'tis yet certain, that the Fire being little it does but little good, and in few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conſequently its Benefit is inconſiderable, or rather none at all.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, If you make a great Fire, as the Nature of ſuch a Fire is to dry up that which is Moiſt, as far as its Heat extends, 'twill doubtleſs parch and dry both the Bark and Branches of the Trees, eſpecially thoſe parts on which the Leaves depend, and conſequently make them ſhrink; ſtop and obſtruct the Channels and Paſſages of the Sap, which ſhould always continue moiſt and open for its free and perpetual Intercourſe, whilſt (as above we ſaid) 'tis indiſpenſably requiſite that the Sap do convey continual Supplies both to the Trunk, Branches, Fruit and Leaves, this diſorder elſe will be ſure to happen, upon the leaſt Interception of this Supply: Sap, without queſtion, being to theſe ſort of Trees what Water is to Fiſhes, and the Air to all Terreſtrial Animals, and even what Foundations are to Buildings, and the Hand is to the Ballance which holds it up, and ſuſpends it in the Air.</p>
                     <p>In all Events this Fire (as Philoſophers ſpeak) Changes, and Dries the Air, and cauſes a notable Alteration, and has the ſame effect upon it as it commonly has on Water, which Experience tells us being Boil'd, and coming after to be expos'd to the freſh Air, grows more ſuſceptible of Cold than 'twas before, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall ſooner Freeze than that which has never been near any Fire at all: So as to the Impreſſions of Cold in relation to the Air, this Fire (kindled in the <hi>Green-Houſe)</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>enders the Air more obnoxious and diſpos'd to receive the Cold which environs it on every part, than that which never was thus alter'd with any Artificial Heat. The Heat of Char-coal, and the like, whether in ſome hidden Stove, or Earthen Pan, though it may perhaps encounter, and hinder ſome Effects of Cold offenſive to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, who will receive no more than they need and have a mind to; yet <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> have not that Gift to diſtinguiſh and know the juſt degree of a Foreign Heat, neceſſary to protect them againſt the rigour of Winter. The truth is, to derive any advantage from Artificial Fire in favour of the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> one ſhould firſt underſtand the juſt Meaſure of the Need which theſe Trees have of it, whether only to defend them from the Cold, or ſo to recover the Heat which they have loſt, as that afterwards no Infirmity may be the conſequent of it; but we have not this Sagacity, an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> which has once been attack'd by the Froſt Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly loſes its Leaves, remaining Sick and Indiſpos'd a long time after. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, it were neceſſary that through the whole extent of the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> the Heat were always Uniform and of the ſame Temper, which it neither is nor can be, for it can neither be equal as to its continuance, nor (as Philoſophers ſpeak) perfectly Regular as to its Intention: That is (as all the World has ſufficiently Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48210:243"/>
maintain a conſtant Heat, and of the ſelf ſame Tenor, eſpecially during the Night, which is the Time that the Cold is moſt Intenſe and Penetrating, and when the Gard'ner is commonly faſt aſleep; ſo as the Fire, which at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or when newly kindled was but moderate, does afterwards Increaſe, the Fuel at laſt being all ſpent and conſum'd, it does either extreamly diminiſh and abate of its Heat, or is altogether extinguiſh'd: Such Fire, I affirm therefore creates great Diſorders in the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> Spoiling the <hi>Boughs</hi> that are neareſt to it, Parching the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and above all, Altering the <hi>Air,</hi> which produces all the Good, and all the Miſchief, accordingly as 'tis well or ill qualified.</p>
                     <p>My Opinion therefore is, that the very beſt Expedient for the Preſervation of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> thus Inclos'd againſt the Cold, which is ſo funeſt and deadly to them, were (as we have ſhew'd) a good Situation and Expoſure: That the Doors be made of ſufficient Thickneſs, and exactly Shutting; The Windows very Cloſe, with good <hi>Chaſſis</hi> double, and well Cauk'd; Eſpecially, that the Walls of the Houſe be Subſtantial. But in Caſe the <hi>Conſervatory</hi> ſhould not have purpoſely been built for this Purpoſe, as now and then it may happen; and that perhaps one is oblig'd to make uſe of a Room that has been formerly ſome Hall, Cellar, or Stable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as occaſion prompts till a Better be made. In ſuch exigence; the beſt way is to build either within, or on the out-ſide (as ſhall be found moſt Convenient) ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Wall, of a full foot in thickneſs, as high, and long as is the old Wall, if you ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it not thick enough; and this ſhould be built of good Maſonry: Or in caſe of Neceſſity, one may Cloath an Old Wall with Litter of a dry Dunghill, beating it very cloſe together as you heap it up; and to the end it may ſtand and not ſlide down, to drive in ſome ſtout quarters of Wood at Competent diſtances from the Wall about four foot of each other, joyning to the Counter-mure of the Litter.</p>
                     <p>Indeed ſuch Litter-Counter-Walls are not ſo ſightly and ſweet within Doors: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they will be a Retreat for <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> which may be apt to gnaw and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark the Trees, not ſparing the Roots themſelves: But beſides that there are many remedies and ways to deſtroy moſt of thoſe Vermin; They are not ſuch deadly and pernicious Enemies to Trees which are Inclos'd, as the <hi>Froſts</hi> againſt which ſuch Counter-Walls of Dung are made uſe of, 'till a more commodious Houſe can be built: This therefore may ſerve to anſwer the Objection of Unſightlineſs, and ill Odor. I wiſh no body (who is a Lover of <hi>Orange-Trees)</hi> may be reduc'd to this Extremity; but may have timely prevented it by erecting a good <hi>Conſervatory</hi> for this purpoſe only.</p>
                     <p>But, if notwithſtanding all theſe Precautions, we diſcover the Ice in our Incloſure, as 'tis eaſily done by hanging a Linnen Rag moiſtned, or ſetting ſome ſmall Diſhes of Water in ſeveral Places of the Houſe in the <hi>Winter-</hi>time, and eſpecially near the Doors and Windows, on the edges of the <hi>Caſes</hi> and <hi>Boxes,</hi> to obſerve whether the <hi>Froſt</hi> (againſt which one cannot be too Watchful and Jealous) have gotten any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: In this Exigence, the moſt Infallible Remedy to maintain a Sweet and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Warmth, and which may laſt as long as one pleaſes; is to Hang up lighted Flambeaux, or Lamps (which will be ſure to laſt) either between the <hi>Chaſſis</hi> againſt the Windows, if it be there the Cold enters, or near the Doors, or all along the whole Houſe; taking care the Flame touch none of the Trees, and that the Warmth continue of the ſame Temper, as is eaſily done: The Experience of ſetting a ſmall Wax-Candle lighted in a <hi>Coach</hi> cloſe ſhut up, or of more than one, in a very cloſe Chamber, may ſerve to Confirm this Expedient, as they have me to Juſtifie this Imagination.</p>

                     <p>TO ſatisfie the Importance and Extent of this Comprehenſive Chapter, I think firſt to propoſe the <hi>Idea</hi> which I have conceiv'd of the Beauty of the <hi>Orange-Tree;</hi> whether it be a Well-grown Tree, a Small, or Moderate one; for there are very fine ones both of the one and other ſort, as well as among all the Species of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48210:243"/>
Animals, there are fair ones of all Ages and Growths: But the Truth is, there is nothing more Rare, than to find <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> ſuch as are Great and Perfect at the ſame time; whilſt it is eaſie enough among the ordinary and moderate ſort, to meet with ſuch as are both Fair, and extreamly handſom: There are alſo I confeſs, very beautiful <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> in <hi>Buſh</hi> (that is, ſuch as produce Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the very bottom) but indeed thoſe which maintain an upright, ſtrait and fair <hi>Stem</hi> of about two feet and an half, to Three or Four, or at moſt, to Five Feet in Height, are much ſtatelier, and carry a certain Majeſty, much Superior to the <hi>Shrub</hi> and <hi>Buſh:</hi> I am not much for thoſe whoſe Beam ſurpaſſes this Height; tho' they have otherwiſe their Beauties alſo, and really ſomething in them of Noble and Royal; ſuch as would Infinitely become a Plantation without Doors, and in plain Ground: But for the <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Box,</hi> they would bring with them great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and be nothing ſo Commodious, in regard of the difficulty of Carrying and Removing them, the Height and Capacity of the Doors, and Cieling of the Conſervatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> from Fifteen to Sixteen Feet, is an handſom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for the well entertaining any Reaſonable and Curious Perſon's Trees: But for ſuch as have Houſes of Twenty, Twenty two, and Twenty four feet high (as indeed there ought to be) for Trees of Eight, Nine, and Ten feet Stem or above, they ought to have Heads correſpondent to their ſtature, and will require <hi>Caſes</hi> of four and five feet Depth: But I confeſs theſe Gyants affright me; there being I fear few Perſons that would be at the Expence of ſuch Buildings: And indeed hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find we the Gates of Cities of that Altitude: However, they deſerve due Praiſe and Encouragement, who in our Days attempt the Raiſing Trees of that goodly Stature, ſince we may hope, that as they appear Worthy the Curioſity of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Monarch of the World, ſo we ſhall ſhortly ſee them an Extraordinary Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Gardens.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore to be able to pronounce that the Head of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be) is Endow'd with all the Beauty and Accompliſhments 'tis capable of, theſe ſix Conditions are requiſite:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Head be of a Round Figure, yet ſo as it be alſo large, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread, and almoſt flat, approaching in Shape to that of a <hi>Muſhroom</hi> newly riſen, or of a <hi>Calott,</hi> yet not Affected or nicely Circular, as they uſe to cut <hi>Myrtles, Tews, Philyria's,</hi> and <hi>Standard-Honey-Suckles, Box,</hi> &amp;c. which appear forc'd and conſtrain'd, but of a Natural Roundneſs, Free and Airy, and without Art, as we commonly ſee grow the <hi>Conſtantinople-Cheſs-Nut, Lime-Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it be Full, without Confuſion within, and not void and hollow as we Affect to have our <hi>Fruit-Trees:</hi> But the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> Heads ſhould be furniſh'd with a pretty number of fair well-fed Branches, almoſt of an equal ſize, and eaſie to be ſeen and numbred if one be diſpos'd. This is one of the moſt principal Conditions of the Beauty of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as it is alſo the moſt Rare, whilſt many do not Eſteem this Confuſion for any great Defect, though I confeſs it appears to me a great one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Branches which form and compoſe the Head of the Tree, be ſufficiently and well Nouriſh'd, and ſo ſtrong that their Tops inſtead of Inclining towards the Earth (as many we find do) erect and hold up their Heads to the Air, with plenty of large and green Leaves; yet ſo, as that the longeſt Branches exceed not half a Foot, ſince if the Boughs ſink down, 'tis a mark they are ſo weak that they are not able to Redreſs themſelves; and ſeeing the new <hi>Shoots</hi> ſpring only from the Extremities and Tops of the old ones (whoſe Situation they naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) it comes to paſs that all ſuch <hi>Shoots</hi> as proceed from thoſe feeble ones, are yet more feeble, and leſs able to erect themſelves, and conſequently yield a very Ill-favour'd Proſpect. Beſides, If the Leaves be ſmall and yellow, 'tis yet a ſign of greater Imbecillity in the Roots (for as much as Naturally this Tree does produce Leaves that are large, green, thick and in plenty) and therefore that they will quickly fall off, and denude the Tree of its genuine Ornament. In ſhort, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this third Qualification propos'd, are, That if the utmoſt length be exceſſive (as a Foot or more would be) the Leaves not being of above three or four Years abiding on the Branch which bears them (and even for thoſe a Tree ought to be a very luſty one, ſince moſt of thoſe which we ſee ſeldom hang on above a Year or two, and live not beyond three or four) it happens, that coming to drop off in their turns, thoſe over-long Branches will appear all naked and bare, which is extreamly unſightly; therefore, whatever Branch in the Spring of the Year advances above half a Foot, it ſhould be nipp'd off and confin'd to that dimenſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48210:244"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth condition requires that the Tree ſhould be ready to put forth plenty of fair <hi>Shoots</hi> every Spring Yearly; which if it do not, or that it only produce but ſmall and trifling ones, the defect is from the Foot, and the next Year after it will be in danger of loſing its Leaf, which ſhould be prevented by all means poſſible. Now no <hi>Shoots</hi> ought to be accounted fair, but ſuch as are of competent length and bigneſs, and conſequently (as we ſhew'd) able to ſuſtain themſelves without bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tops; ſuch never fail of large and green Leaves, which they keep on from falling, ſince thoſe which have now perhaps been on for three Years paſt, coming to drop according to the courſe of Nature, there is ſtill a ſucceſſion of thoſe of the two former Years, beſides thoſe of the current and preſent Year, to maintain the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Decoration of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis required that our <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> produce (not an Infinite, but) a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable quantity of Flowers, fair, great, long, large and weighty, ſuch as give pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of goodly Fruit: On which I am to Advertiſe, That <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> do every Spring produce two ſorts of Flowers, one whereof proceeding from the old Wood or <hi>Shoot</hi> of the precedent Year, uſually are but ſmall and round, and confus'dly plac'd, ſo as moſt of them drop off without knitting; and theſe firſt appear in the early Spring. But Woe to that Tree which is over-charg'd with them however the Owner eſteem of it; their Beauty will ſoon paſs, and the end of it be unproſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and diſpleaſing.</p>
                     <p>I foreſee that my Sentiments herein will not be very Acceptable to every body, divers Curious Perſons fancying that an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> can never bring forth too many Flowers; but for all that, I adventure to declare it a great Miſtake, which Time and Experience will Cure them of. I ſhould willingly be of their Opinion, were it poſſible to Reconcile that large quantity of thoſe ſort of Flowers with thoſe other Conditions, which indeed I eſteem a great deal more, the Beauty of the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thoſe being but for one Fortnight, whereas the other are the Beauty of the whole Year about, and therefore to be preferr'd.</p>
                     <p>The other Flowers of the <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> ſpring out at the tops of the Shoots of that Year, and commonly with thoſe tranſcendent Qualities we have enumerated; nor come they in Cluſters and confus'dly, but are of ſubſtance long, and well fed, and do not appear 'til the end of <hi>June,</hi> or beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and of which we cannot have too many.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Requiſite to the Beauty of the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> is its being free of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, Duſt and Sullage, and eſpecially of <hi>Bugs</hi> and <hi>Piſmires.</hi> We have ſhew'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready how this may eaſily be compaſs'd at the beginning of this Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>Having thus propos'd the Idea which I have form'd of a Beautiful-headed <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> and eſpecially ſuppoſing they have not fail'd in performing all the Directions I have given concerning the <hi>Root,</hi> in order to its <hi>Shooting</hi> well (upon which all the reſt depends) there remains to inquire what there is more to be done to arrive at this Idea, whether in Relation to ſuch Trees as have not yet begun their Heads, and are but newly <hi>In-Cas'd,</hi> or in Reſpect to others, which have never received any Aſſiſtance or (as one may ſay) Education at all.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt, As to the roundneſs and fullneſs of the Head, I conceive that having well conſider'd and approv'd of it, one ſhall eaſily diſcover the defects which are repugnant to it, ſo as one ſhall not endure ſo much as the ſight of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> unfurniſh'd in the middle, flat at one of the ſides, over long on another, or riſing in Pyramid like a <hi>Cypreſs,</hi> or with Branches groveling on the Earth like the tardy and late-bearing <hi>Cherry-Tree:</hi> You will not (I ſay) be able to ſuffer the leaſt Bough to ſtart out beyond its Fellows, disfiguring the roundneſs which is now a forming.</p>
                     <p>And ſo for the ſupply of Vacuities (which ſeldom is the Fault of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that on the contrary grow Naturally full, confus'd and irregular, as do moſt ſorts of other <hi>Fruit-Trees)</hi> one is to conſider, that this defect either proceeds from no other Cauſe than from the Ignorance, and ill handling of the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> or that ſome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and middle Branches may unhappily, or unwarily have been broken. In either of theſe Caſes, there's nothing to be done but to endeavour the preſerving of thoſe other Branches which Nature will not fail of putting forth if the Tree be vigorous; or if it be not in condition (whilſt perhaps it is become Sick and Languiſhing) you muſt ſpeedily reſolve to Lop off, and Abate one or two of the biggeſt Branches near to the middle, being certain of its ſoon producing others, ſufficient to furniſh and repair this blemiſh in a little time.</p>
                     <p>As to a Tree defective in roundneſs, or that you find one of its ſides too flat, it may proceed from a double Cauſe; as either from ſome Accident of a Boughs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48210:244"/>
being broken, which ſhould naturally have Contributed to that comely Figure, and then the remaining ſound part of the Branch muſt of neceſſity be Cut off, as far as to that very place which the Diſcretion of an Able <hi>Gard'ner</hi> judges may beſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Defect: Or elſe it ſprings from where an Ignorant <hi>Gardner</hi> may have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſome one or more Libertine great Branches to ſhoot uncontroll'd, and to have Robb'd and receiv'd all the Nouriſhment from the Reſt; whilſt the moſt ſeeble parts remain as it were Abandon'd: whereas, he ſhould have Nipp'd off thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitants, at their very firſt appearing, and Reduc'd them to Order, or elſe have Cut them ſhort the enſuing <hi>Spring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Branches thus Nipp'd off, or diſcreetly Cut, would not have fail'd to ſprout from all about the Tops ſeveral New Branches, and become a Round and handſome Tree: Nay for the Redreſs of ſuch a Fault (a great one in my Opinion) one is ſometimes forc'd to proceed to an Operation which at firſt appears a little Cruel; Namely, to the <hi>Amputation</hi> of all thoſe Wanderers, and conſtrain the <hi>Whole-Tree</hi> to begin a new the forming of that agreeable Roundneſs, as ſhall be thought moſt Convenient, and which commonly reaches to that feeble part of the Tree: Or elſe one muſt begin upon the very Tops and Summity of thoſe eſcaped Branches, provided there be any likelihood of bringing it to a Beautiful Shape, in which Caſe, one is to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all thoſe ſmall and Infirm ones that ſtand in the way:</p>
                     <p>If the Figure of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> be diſagreeable by being too long ſided; you have no more to do, than to Cut away, and abate all that part which grows out of due Rank, and ſtrangles beyond its bound: The ſame is to be done to the Pointed, and over Tapering Trees, till you have reduc'd them to that Globular and deſirable Figure a little Flatted at the Crown.</p>
                     <p>But in Caſe that moſt of the Branches bend down their Tops, it proceeds from want of ſtrength; elſe they all of them naturally ſuſtain themſelves upright, if of ſufficient Subſtance to ſupport the burden of the Leaves: Now this defect of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour ſometimes ſprings for want of wholeſome Nouriſhment, and now and then from the Superfluous number of Branches, which require to be fed according to the vigour of the Root, be it Great, or Small; ſince its Strength can reach but a determin'd point: The <hi>Gard'ner</hi> therefore ought to be an Able, and Experienc'd Workman; Firſt, in knowing how to apply good and proper <hi>Mould</hi> (of which the Chapter above has amply treated) and then (having done his Endeavour as to that particular) to Conſider what Weight and Charge his Tree is able to ſuſtain, and accordingly leave no more Branches on than can well be fed, and the <hi>Stem</hi> ſupport.</p>
                     <p>When therefore one perceives a Tree to ſuffer under this Infirmity, the Branches Growling or over-bending (which happly may not yet proceed from want of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment) one ſhould begin to take a great part of thoſe Branches quite away; Namely, all the Feeble ones, and thoſe eſpecially which grow out of Order, and diſcompoſe the Figure; preſerving only thoſe Subſtantial ones which are found well plac'd.</p>
                     <p>This Operation ſhould be perform'd with great diligence, juſt when the Trees begin to Sprout; and therefore one is to Obſerve, that commonly, as to <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> (for it does not fall out the ſame in moſt other Trees) from whatever part a Branch does Iſſue, be it from the Body of the Tree, or from ſome other Bough, 'tis ever accompanied with a Second, and not ſeldom with a Third; upon which this Reflection is to be made; That in caſe the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is divided into Two or Three Channels, were all reduc'd to One alone, namely to a ſingle Branch; that one Branch partaking of the greater Portion, would doubtleſs be the moſt ſtrong and vigorous, and capable of Erecting its Head, and Supporting all its Weight.</p>
                     <p>Now the Aſſembling and Uniting this divaricated Juice to one <hi>Channel,</hi> is ſoon learn'd and done, by pulling off the ſmall Shoots, and notably diminiſhing of their number, not leaving above one in a place, Namely, the handſomeſt, and moſt Commodious, in order to the deſired Figure propoſed. This pulling off the <hi>Shoots</hi> ſhould be done as ſoon as poſſibly, that the <hi>Sap</hi> ſpend not it ſelf unprofitably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Faulty Branches to be taken away; but finding its accuſtomed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage not only ſtopp'd and intercepted, but another (which is near it) open, may flow in plentifully there, and render it a conſiderable increaſe of Nouriſhment, and as Certain of Succeſs, as the Execution of it is Eaſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48210:245"/>
'Tis ſufficiently Evident, that it were much better not to have above one ſingle good and ſubſtantial <hi>Shoot,</hi> than two or three moderate ones; One ſtrong, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and conſequently moſt Beautiful <hi>Shoot,</hi> ſhall furniſh infinitely beyond all thoſe trifling ones which can produce but poor and deſpicable <hi>Foliage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It often fortunes, that ſuch a Branch, ſo Nouriſh'd with the portion of three or four, will in a ſhort time become of great length, and much exceed its Neighbours, to the ruine of our Propos'd <hi>Symmetrie:</hi> Wherefore, in this Caſe, 'tis adviſable to Nip it off, and not permit it to exceed a Foot in length. To which Standard and Size, I would willingly Reduce the <hi>Shoots</hi> of all our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> that by this means, their Heads growing at leaſt a Foot large in Diameter every Year (never above) that is half a Foot on each part or ſide round the <hi>Stem</hi> (I do not mean to Reſtrain its growing more in height, half a Foot ſhall ſuffice me) One may be Contented with this Annual Augmentation for the Diameter; ſince it fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes an Increaſe of Six Feet, in Six or Seven Years, which is very Conſiderable if one be able to attain it, as I doubt not but the <hi>Orangiſt</hi> will Accompliſh doing his Duty as he ſhould, or the Fault is in the <hi>Gard'ner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in Caſe that all you thus Nip off, ſoon after produce new <hi>Shoots,</hi> and that in reaſonable number, well plac'd, for the equally furniſhing the whole Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your <hi>Orange-Tree;</hi> 'Tis happy for you, and ſhould be Cheriſh'd, ſince it does not often happen: And therefore if there be but few Branches, that having been ſo Nip'd put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orth new <hi>Shoots</hi> at their Tops, you ſhould ſpare none of them but ſuch as may Contribute to the Beauty of the Figure; continually plucking off all the Springs of the reſt: Which if the Lazy or Unskilful <hi>Gard'ner</hi> have omitted to do, and what elſe has lately been directed him, and was to have been done in <hi>Summer</hi> (when thoſe <hi>Shoots</hi> being extremly Tender and Brittle, knap off eaſier than Glaſs) You muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Knife</hi> again, and fall to Cutting when they are now grown Hard, either at the end of <hi>Summer,</hi> before you ſhut them up in the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> (which is beſt) or at the <hi>Spring</hi> of the Year, when you bring them forth: For abſolutely, you muſt not Indulge any one Branch that grows Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly, diſgracing the Shape and comely Figure which one ſhould always bear in Mind and aim at.</p>
                     <p>The Pruning and Cutting of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> has an advantage, which other Trees have not, Particularly <hi>Peach-Trees;</hi> It often happening that a Branch of the <hi>Peach</hi> being cut off, does not ſprout at all again, hindred by a certain <hi>Gum</hi> that kills it: But of the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> whatever Branch you cut, or pinch off, if it be a Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tree, ſmall or great, it will not fail of re-producing new ones, according to the ſtrength and ability of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>As to Nipping of the <hi>Orange-Tree;</hi> you ſhould never permit any new, long and ſtraggling Branch upon them, excepting on ſuch as have been newly Planted, and that yet have nothing to ſhew but the <hi>Stem</hi> only, without any old Branches: 'Tis neceſſary that thoſe ſort of Trees ſhould ſpeedily put forth good and luſty <hi>Shoots,</hi> and ſuch as being free and without intanglement, may form an Head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the bigneſs and ſtature of the <hi>Stem;</hi> which they would not do, but on the Contrary, produce ſome confuſed ſlight ones, if according to the Rules formerly Eſtabliſhed, the vigorous <hi>Shoots</hi> were not pinch'd off ſhort.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Summer Solſtice</hi> is the proper Seaſon when <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> make their ſtrongeſt and moſt vigorous <hi>Shoot,</hi> Namely the Month of <hi>June;</hi> and 'tis then one ſhould be moſt Induſtrious in Nipping, and taking off the falſe <hi>Shoots,</hi> and Watering them more than at other times; That is, once or twice a Week, thereby to Aſſiſt them in this firſt and greateſt Action, and to promote the continuance of it, which ſometimes they Redouble conſiderably towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> and beginning of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> And therefore the ſame care is to be taken in <hi>June.</hi> But if this exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Second puſhing, do not appear till towards the expiration of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or commencement of <hi>September,</hi> they are worth little: The <hi>Shoots</hi> of that Seaſon will periſh in the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> for want of time to perfect them; and therefore it were beſt to take them off as ſoon as they peep; That the <hi>Sap</hi> which gave them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, may continue in the bodies of the Branches that bare them, and make them the ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as you perceive any luſty Branch left upon a Tree <hi>Re-Cas'd,</hi> that has made no <hi>Shoot</hi> in any part of it, excepting perhaps, a ſome few ſmall yellowiſh and trifling ones, inſtead of ſtrong and luſty ones; ſuch as was expected to break out from the extremities of thoſe Branches, and ſhould have ſerv'd to Shape the Tree: Cut them away without any ſcruple, even during the Pride of their <hi>Sap.</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48210:245"/>
Thoſe which you leave will proſper much the better.</p>
                     <p>I am alſo bold to affirm, That 'tis impoſſible to have an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> anſwerable to the Idea which I have conceiv'd; unleſs you take off thoſe early <hi>Shoots</hi> ſo ſoon as ever they firſt begin to puſh; and eſpecially from thoſe Trees which have not as yet attain'd that goodly Head which becomes them: Thoſe Trees which are left with theſe ſmaller <hi>Shoots</hi> on them without this diſcharge, or that it be not finiſhhd, before the Flowers are paſt, may indeed produce more Flowers, but never come to be Beautiful Trees.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe are moſt to be Condemn'd; foraſmuch as all the Branches of thoſe Trees abound with Knots and Bunches, and conſequently are full of <hi>Buggs,</hi> producing none ſave a few pittiful Flowers: The others diſcover themſelves ſoon enough (as well as the Firſt) to ſee themſelves ſtripp'd of theirs, whilſt they ſuffer'd a part of the Nouriſhment to go into, and feed thoſe Branches which are to be taken away, inſtead of managing it for thoſe which are to be preſerv'd, and would become much fairer, ſtrong, and well furniſh'd with goodly Flowers, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leaves.</p>
                     <p>This pinching off the idle <hi>Shoots,</hi> does not only Contribute to the Rounding, Filling, and extending of the Head of an <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> but likewiſe gives it all thoſe other graces and perfections 'tis capable of; It produces fairer and ſtouter <hi>Shoots,</hi> ſtrong and able to ſuſtain themſelves; adorns it with plentiful Leaves, ample and lovely Green; and enables the Tree to put forth abundance of new <hi>Shoots</hi> every <hi>Spring,</hi> and afterward to produce a ſufficient quantity of goodly Fruit; and laſtly, hinders the increaſe of thoſe numerous Swarms of <hi>Buggs</hi> and <hi>Ants</hi> you ſee crawling on the Heads of thoſe Trees, ſo extreamly Bunch'd, and full of Tufted Leaves, and conſequently preſerves them in that Neatneſs and Beauty which is ſo Charming.</p>
                     <p>If therefore (always ſuppoſing a Commodious <hi>Green-Houſe)</hi> a little Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry inable one to maintain our Trees in this excellent plight, of Shape, Beauty, Strength and Soundneſs: Is't not evident, that it is no ſuch hard and difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to know what is firſt to be done to Recover, and ſtabliſh thoſe which happly are deficient in nothing but their Shape and Figure; being otherwiſe Vigorous and Luſty Trees; as alſo ſuch as are of Shape and Figure beautiful enough; but want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength and health: and laſtly, to Recover thoſe, which labouring under both theſe Defects together, Languiſh and are ready to Periſh?</p>
                     <p>Generally, The great diſorder of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> happen to them from theſe four different Cauſes: Firſt, from the <hi>In-Caſing,</hi> which peradventure was not carefully done, or with improper <hi>Mould;</hi> or for want of Renewing in due time. Secondly, from ſome defect in the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> its being over-Heated with Fire; or from the Cold or too much Moiſture. Thirdly, it may proceed from Without, as by <hi>Hail,</hi> Impetuous <hi>Winds,</hi> or ſome other unforeſeen Accident. And Laſtly, from their being ill and unskilfully <hi>Prun'd</hi> and <hi>Cut,</hi> or perhaps too unmercifully: Alſo from <hi>over-Watering</hi> without neceſſity, or neglect of due Refreſhment during the Months of <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> Theſe are in my Opinion the principle Cauſes of <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> being reduc'd many times to a miſerable Condition.</p>
                     <p>That which many <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are ſo afraid of, and does not a little trouble them, is, That to Remedy theſe Defects, they are often neceſſitated to have recourſe to the Severity of Abating and Cutting off both the Head and Foot of their Trees: Which Operation, very few ſave the skilful in theſe matters, are capable of, and all the World are ready to Condemn at firſt ſight, how well ſoever it be perform'd: But however, we hope, the Curious, truly knowing and Experienc'd will Approve of it, and are certain that the Succeſs will Juſtifie it, though it indeed require ſome time.</p>
                     <p>To Commence firſt with the Roots of a <hi>Sick Orange,</hi> or <hi>Lemon-Tree</hi> if it has long been <hi>Cas'd,</hi> ſo as one may reaſonably ſuſpect that the Roots are come to Touch the bottom of the <hi>Box,</hi> and ſo to receive no Nouriſhment there: One is then to Reſolve without more ado to take it quite out of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> and Abate two third parts of the <hi>Clod,</hi> and withall to examine whether the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Clod</hi> be not too <hi>Light;</hi> and if ſo, to Water it ſufficiently for three or four Hours before you lift it out; Thus the Earth being well drench'd, the Roots may adhere the faſter to it, and you with more eaſe and aſſurance take away what you judge Convenient.</p>
                     <p>This is not to be done where you find the <hi>Earth</hi> ſo light, exceſſive dry, and exhauſted as to fall, and crumble away at every touch more than it ſhould: But in caſe it be ſufficiently tenacious and conſiſtent to hold, ſpare the Pains of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering we ſpeak of in <hi>New Caſing.</hi> If the Trees have not been <hi>Cas'd</hi> above a Year
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48210:246"/>
or Two, and have perhaps been planted too deep and low: You ſhould then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine in what Temper the Earth is; as whether too ſtrong or over light: If the Latter; you muſt give them an half <hi>Re-Caſing;</hi> That is, ſupply them with as much well prepared, and better condition'd <hi>Mould</hi> as you can, and be careful in the mean time that you neither ſhake the Tree, or lay bare its Roots, which would be very prejudicial. But if you find the <hi>Earth</hi> to be over Groſs and Stiff, or not ſufficient, I hold your beſt courſe is to <hi>Uncaſe</hi> it quite, and to abate part of the <hi>Clod</hi> after 'tis well Sob'd and Moiſtned, and to replace and ſet it in again, as already we have taught; ſince in truth, all that can be done about the Head, will be of ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, unleſs you begin firſt to fecure the Foot, which is the Baſis and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, and the ſole Architect able to Preſerve both Head and all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Having thus perform'd what is due to the Foot, your next work muſt be about the Head again, and make account that what you'l moſt Regret, are the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Tops of the Branches, to which hardly any Nouriſhment for a long time has been able to arrive, and accordingly, you'l find them Chang'd and Dry'd exceedingly, either by reaſon of the diminution of the <hi>Sap</hi> it ſelf in the Roots, or that the Head and Branches are charg'd beyond what the Foot is able to Support: Not unlike thoſe Fountains, which cannot Riſe to their accuſtomed height, either from the failure of the Spring or Sourſe, or that the Waters are too much divided and have taken ſome other Courſe. In this Exigent, you muſt not only pluck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and cut off the Tops of thoſe Branches, but do it to the purpoſe, ſince your own Reaſon will tell you, that having Treated the Foot as a Sick and Crazy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you ſhould not charge it with a greater Burden than it can bear. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Tree to be in a languiſhing Condition (as by its Root appears) and that you have been oblig'd to retrench a conſiderable part of it: That is, That a great many of thoſe Agents, which wrought and endeavoured to Maintain the whole Tree, be extreamly diminiſh'd by theſe great Abatements and Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Roots, (although for the good and benefit of all) You muſt reſolve to do as much proportionably, by diminiſhing of the Head.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as you expect your Tree ſhould likely put forth new Branches at the Tops of the old ones which you have ſhortn'd: You ſhould carry ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> in your Mind of the Shape and Beauty you would bring it to, that no more new Branches ſucceed in any place, than what may ſerve and contribute to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Idea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now according to this <hi>Idea</hi> one ought to be as Diſcreet as Bold: Diſcreet, to Cut and Prune off no more than is neceſſary; Bold, to ſpare no unprofitable Branches. In a word, one ſhould be Compleat Maſter of the Operation, and proceed Couragiouſly and without heſitation: He ſhall elſe work with a Trembling Hand, in fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blam'd for having been too free with his <hi>Knife,</hi> and cut too much; and by this means falling into the common and contrary Error of not Cutting enough at firſt, be at laſt reduc'd to a neceſſity of ſtill Cutting more for two or three Years ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, by which a great deal of Time's loſt that one ſhall afterwards repent of.</p>
                     <p>Not but that however Skilful and dextrous one be in Pruning, one ſhall now and then find ſome Tops of cut Branches to die without putting forth any <hi>Shoots</hi> at all, eſpecially among the Sick and long diſeaſed Trees; ſo as one ſhall be forc'd to cut them again lower, and that immediately as ſoon as ever one finds that there's nothing to be hop'd for or expected, as you'l know by a <hi>Dryneſs,</hi> accompanied with a certain <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> or ſome <hi>Cleft,</hi> and then you'l never be in danger of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for having abated too much.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48210:246"/>
Branches of the Years before, they are to be looked on but as falſe Money, which makes a fair ſhew indeed, and nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>I muſt here acquaint you, that it is not with <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> as with other Fruits which come from the <hi>Kernel</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> as to what concerns all ſorts of Branches: For Inſtance, Thoſe great Boughs which we call <hi>Falſe Wood,</hi> are commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and hurtful to <hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> Indeed, on whatever part we find them to grow, we ought inſtantly to make War againſt them, and Cut them off, as very ſeldom producing Fruit, which is the thing we principally ſeek from thoſe Trees, and therefore Spare and Cheriſh with great Care the ſmall and feeble Branches: But as to the <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> the chief thing we affect, is to have them of a beautiful and elegant Shape, that they appear full of Vigour, as well by their <hi>Leaves</hi> as the <hi>Shoots</hi> they make, without being much concerned about the <hi>Flowers,</hi> which commonly they are furniſh'd with in too great quantity: Hence it is, that we ſave and ſpare all the great and ſubſtantial Branches we can, even thoſe which in our <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> they call <hi>Water-Bows,</hi> or <hi>Falſe-Wood;</hi> provided that both the one and the other be well plac'd: In effect, they are thoſe only which are able to put out others as fair, and as many as we have need of, and conſequently to produce large and ample Leaves, and as fair and goodly <hi>Flowers</hi> as one would deſire.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiſs here, that for the Conſolation of the Curious, I give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the firſt Shoots which puſh out at the Tops of the old Branches of thoſe Trees that have been <hi>Re-Caſed</hi> whilſt they were Sick: I ſay, That theſe new Shoots, far from being ſound and ſtrong, are themſelves very Sick and near their end. But let not this trouble you, they commonly reſemble Water that firſt runs through the Pipe of a Fountain newly made, which comes foul and duty, as bringing along with it the filth and ſullage of the Ground and Place it paſſes through; neither is the Pipe clean at firſt 'til it cleanſe it ſelf, the pure new Water of the Sourſe, aſſiſted by the Wind, chaſes the filth before it; after which it continues to run perfectly clear. In like manner the Shoots of an <hi>Orange-Tree</hi> that are Sick, are Yellowiſh and Languid, becauſe its Branches retain nothing in them ſave the Dregs, and ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of a Morbific and Tainted Sap, riſing from the long Diſeas'd and Infected Roots; and therefore you cannot reaſonably expect that ſuch a Tree ſhould make any new, ſtrong and vigorous Shoots, large and Verdant Leaves, 'til it produce new and ſound Roots, by having the old ones cut away, and an application of new and ſound Earth at its <hi>Re-Caſing,</hi> with good Government and Culture. 'Tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that what proceeds even from the faireſt new Roots, come ordinarily at the foot, and underneath the firſt yellow ſick ones; and which from the ſole Effort of the Rarefaction of the Spring, have been immediately produc'd independently from the new Roots. But theſe laſt Shoots which come out below theſe, near the Body of the Tree, proceed from the Operation of the new Roots, which acting their part in their freſh and new good Earth (given them at their <hi>Re-Caſing)</hi> prepare good and wholſom Sap, and conſequently produce fair and goodly Shoots.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuch newly <hi>Re-Cas'd</hi> Trees, are ſometimes a great many years e'r they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing, ſo as one may fitly compare them to ſome Animals, that having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a long time upon unwholſom Food, find it very difficult to Recover when they come to that which is better; and it ſeems as the Stomach, Muſcles, Bowels <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of theſe Creatures are ſhrunk up by Famine and Want: So the Skin which Clothes and Inveſts the Stems and Roots (the Seat of the Principle of the Life of <hi>Orange-Trees)</hi> grows hard, and by this means, the Heat which ſhould Revive, Excite and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate this Vital Spring, which puts all into Action (and Animates and Awakens the old Roots to begin to Act a new) is not able to reach them, and to Rarifie the old torpent and ſluggiſh Sap, and Mollifie the dry Bark, for the paſſage of the new Roots to which it ſhould give Birth.</p>
                     <p>But albeit ſuch newly <hi>Cas'd</hi> Trees remain a long time without Action, as being in a manner quite Stupified, one is not yet quite to deſpair of them, ſo long as there's any appearance of Green in them, for I have known ſome of them three or four years without putting forth ſo much as one Shoot, and yet afterwards do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                     <p>Moſt ſort of Trees regularly do ſooner put forth new Shoots than new Root (as we have ſhewed in our Treatiſe of <hi>Plants)</hi> but <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> Spring ſooner at the Root than in the Branches, and in more abundance. One may know as to both theſe effects, that when they grow in the Roots, they produce new Shoots, of which if any dye after they have begun to Shoot, 'tis a ſign that the new Root does alſo periſh, tho' it ſeldom happens.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48210:247"/>
'Tis likewiſe to be remembred, that if upon the old Branches of the Trees we ſpeak of, new ones ſpring out in ſeveral places, and the faireſt of them puſh in thoſe parts that are neareſt the Body of the Tree, one ſhould bring them as near one another as is poſſible, and abandoning all the reſt, follow and promote this Natural Vigour whereſoever it ſhews it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe it is not at all neceſſary to Advertiſe you to cover over the Wounds and Scars of the Amputations you have made in thoſe ſtrong bigger Branches or Stems, with Wax which is prepar'd; this one never fails of, and Careful <hi>Gard'ners</hi> are diligent to obſerve it: I wiſh they were as Induſtrious in the reſt of what belongs to the <hi>Culture</hi> of <hi>Orange-Trees.</hi> This prepar'd Wax protects the Wound againſt the Heat and Ardour of the Sun, and is Compos'd of a very ſmall quantity of Oil mingled with new Yellow Bees-Wax, melted and brought to ſuch a temper as makes it eaſie to be handled and ſpread. The Apothecaries (at <hi>Paris)</hi> commonly ſell it ready made, and for the better ſhow, Colour it with ſome cheap Red, Green or Blue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is more than needs.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſaid all that I think needful concerning the <hi>Re-Caſing</hi> of Sick <hi>Orange-Trees;</hi> it remains to give ſome Directions about thoſe, that being ſound and ſtrong, may have been batter'd and ſpoil'd by Hail and Winds, or other unexpected Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: But this operation is nothing ſo terrible and ſevere as what we have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd a little while ago, the greateſt miſchief happening commonly among the Leaves, which the Hail may have jagg'd and mangled, whilſt the Roots (which are the moſt Important) ſuffer nothing which obliges one to New <hi>Caſe</hi> them. On this Accident one needs only to Strip the Leaves off, and if any Shoot be broken or bruis'd, to Cut it off beneath the place; and in caſe one finds that one ſide is more broken than the other (which may Disfigure the Tree) ſpare not to Cut, and Trim the other unhurt ſide as much, for it being a vigorous Tree (as it to be ſuppos'd) you will quickly ſee it Recover: But if it be a Sick and Languiſhing Tree, the Miſchance will prompt one the ſooner to <hi>Re-Caſe</hi> it. So as if it have ſuffer'd by the Hail towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June</hi> (which is ordinarily the moſt dangerous Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) one ſhould go about it immediately with a conſiderable Retrenchment of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but if the Hail have ſpar'd it 'til the end of <hi>July,</hi> 'twill be ſufficient to <hi>Prune,</hi> and Cut off thoſe <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> that have been ſo ſpoil'd.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Title of this Chapter is not ſo long, as the Matter and Subject of it will be ſuccinct and ſhort: Not but that one might perplex it with ſome Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent difficulties; As whether I ſhould firſt begin to ſpeak of what were to be done at the Bringing out the <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> or at their Carrying into the <hi>Green-Houſe-</hi>Since the Bringing of them out, ſuppoſes they firſt were Carried in; and their being Carried in, that whether one had them by Succeſſion, or New Purchaſe and Acquiſition, they already had been ſet Abroad, and afterwards brought In: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that Probleme, whether were Firſt, the <hi>Egg</hi> or the <hi>Chick?</hi> But as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Point is of no very great Importance, I ſhall leave it to the Deciſion of thoſe who are at Leiſure, and would make themſelves Merry.</p>
                     <p>Returning then to my Subject and ſuppoſing, that as to the Removing and Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Caſes</hi> and <hi>Boxes</hi> of the Middle and ſmaller Size, every body knows 'tis done by <hi>Wheel-Barrows,</hi> or ſtrong <hi>Coul-Staves,</hi> which with good <hi>Hocks</hi> take hold on the Bottom of the <hi>Caſes</hi> at both ſides, or elſe with Ropes put about the four Feet, to carry the Great Trees, to place them on low <hi>Truckles</hi> by the help of <hi>Lovers,</hi> and ſo draw them along, either by the labour of Men or Horſes to the Stations appointed for them. This ſuppos'd, I ſay to the other part of my Contents; That as theſe Trees affect Warmth, and as from <hi>Mid-May</hi> (when we bring them forth) to <hi>Mid-October</hi> (when we ſhut them up) which is the whole time of their Expoſure, they do well enough in what place ſoever you ſet them, provided they enjoy the Sun,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48210:247"/>
at leaſt a good part of the day: So they are moſt happily plac'd if near a Wall, Wood, or Grove to protect them from the North. Beſides, this Situation being from the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the time of carrying into the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> is of all the reſt moſt convenient for them, as defending them from the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Winds, which about that Seaſon blow, and commonly diſorder and exceedingly ruffle our <hi>In-Cas'd</hi> Trees: So as if one had the Convenience, it were to be wiſh'd, that after they had been expos'd to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> during the Months of <hi>May, June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> (which in effect, are the moſt favourable Situations for them at firſt bringing out of the <hi>Green-Houſe)</hi> You might afterwards expoſe them to the <hi>North</hi> till Mid-<hi>October,</hi> when it is time to carry them in. The expoſing them to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> Screens the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> from the <hi>North</hi> Winds, which are Cold, and eſpecially from the <hi>North-Weſt</hi> that blow moſt in <hi>May,</hi> and are not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without White Froſts enough to ſpoil them.</p>
                     <p>As to the Time of Carrying in, and Bringing out theſe Trees, every body knows that as they dread nothing ſo much as Cold, they are to be protected from that, where-ever it Invades and threatens them. Now the Nights ſeldom fail of being Cold and dangerous till about the Full Moon of <hi>April,</hi> or towards the Eighth, Tenth, or Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> when you may boldly bring them forth: Eſpecially if there be any appearance of Rain during that Full-Moon: But if on the Contrary, the Sharp and Cold Winds continue, have patience a while, till the Weather come to be more favourable.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Nights begin to be Cold near the fifteenth of <hi>October,</hi> which is your juſt time of Retiring them into the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> or at leaſt to bring them ſo near it, that in caſe the Seaſon prove very fair, you may ſuſpend the carrying them in for a few days; for as long as you find the Weather at all Inviting, it does the <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> good to enjoy the freſh Air; Eſpecially thoſe, whoſe <hi>Shoots</hi> grow ſtill in Length: But as ſoon as ever the Wind Changing menaces Cold, haſten them to Covert as ſpeedily as conveniently you can.</p>
                     <p>I have been particularly Cautious at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> not to bring them forth (as I noted) till the Full Moon of <hi>April</hi> be paſt; becauſe commonly we are till then in danger of Froſts: And I take care that the Air begins to be very Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Temperate, eſpecially if there be ſhew of a warm and gentle Shower, which if it happen, I often reſolve to bring them forth before Mid-<hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is certain, that however ſome <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> give Signs, and ſeem (as one may ſay) Impatient to be at Liberty, by the <hi>Shoots</hi> they begin to put out in the <hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> and would undoubtedly be much better abroad in the Sweet and more benigne Air, than in that which has been pent up, and is Colder by reaſon of ſo long abſence of the Sun. Yet ſince the Froſt but of one ſingle Night, may extreamly prejudice them, parch many of their Leaves, and ruin the Tops of the tender new <hi>Shoots;</hi> I perſwade you to have a very ſpecial Regard to the Temper and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Seaſon, and that rather than Hazard them, to defer their Expoſure, though it be a little late, than at all too ſoon. In a favourable Year, Warm, and Showry one may do well to bring them ſooner out: But in a Dry, Cold, and Windy Year be not over-haſtly of Expoſing them, and even in Places that are low, you had need yet to be more ſcrupulous, than in the higher and more Elevated: Becauſe commonly, the free Air, and the ſmall Breezes ſpring there, the Froſts are leſs to be apprehended.</p>
                     <p>Now as a kind and gentle Shower were to be deſired at the time of their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; above all, that their Leaves might be Waſh'd and Cleans'd from the duſt contracted in the Houſe: For the ſame Reaſon, one ſhould be glad of ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shower a little before we carry them in to cleanſe them of the Duſt gotten on them Abroad. But not that I Counſel you to Retire them whilſt it actually Rains, leſt the Sob'd Leaves, ſhut up wet, ſhould ſoon become ſoul and ſqualid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by the Duſt ſettling on them there: However you muſt Remember to give them one plentiful Watering, ſo ſoon as you have Rang'd and Plac'd them in the Houſe, as was directed you in the Eighth Chapter, wherein we have copiouſly ſpoken of Refreſhments to be applied whilſt Abroad.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not very neceſſary to Repeat here, That as great Care is to be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Cold from piercing into the <hi>Green-Houſe:</hi> So nor ſhould there be leſs, for the duly opening the Windows when the Sun ſhines; and the preſerving them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice:</hi> But of this alſo, we have ſpoken in the Chapter of the Qualifications of a good <hi>Green-Houſe.</hi>

There only now Remains to Caution, That there be ſome ſpace left between the <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> Walk and the <hi>Caſes;</hi> as well to keep their Branches from touching the Walls and being ſpoil'd, as for commodiouſly paſſing to Viſit and Water the Trees from time to time if occaſion be: Moreover, that if your <hi>Green-Houſe</hi> be a very ample one, ſo as to contain a double Rank of Trees, Ornamentally and with Symmetry all your other Plants (ſo as to leave an Alley in the middle, and enjoy a graceful Walk between them) it will be worth your Conſideration how to do it, ſo as to Embelliſh the Place with ſeveral other <hi>Vaſas,</hi> and Pots of Flowers of the Seaſon, by placing them about them, or plunging them in the Ground, which would grace and become the Front of the Door, by ſetting the leſſer Trees and Shrubs above the Greater, and by Raiſing alſo the Greater on Blocks as on ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Piedeſtales,</hi> ſo as to hide the Naked Walles (and the Blocks themſelves too) with <hi>Pots</hi> and little <hi>Boxes:</hi> Thus will the Room appear full and aboundantly Furniſhed: The <hi>Lemons, Limes, Jeſſamines, Myrtles, Laurel Trees, Lentiſes</hi> and ſome <hi>Cherry-Laurels,</hi> and a World of other <hi>Simples</hi> properly enter into the Ornament, and the variety of <hi>Foliage</hi> Rejoyces and Recreates one marvellouſly. But for the <hi>Pome-Granate</hi> and <hi>Roſe-Laurel-Trees</hi> (looſing their Leaves ſo ſoon) they are not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, as neither are the ſmall Sharp-pointed gray Leaves of that other Shrub, which diſparage our <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> and diſgrace the reſt of the verdant <hi>Theatre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would likewiſe if Poſſible, that in bringing them Abroad, which were ſo well ranged within, they ſhould be ſet and diſpos'd in as graceful a Figure without, for the Decoration of the Place they are to <hi>Summer</hi> in; and above all, if it might be ſo Martial'd as agreeably to ſurprize the Eye, by making them appear in greater number than they really are: And now I think there has enough been ſaid, concerning <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> their Flowers, Leaves, and <hi>Shoots;</hi> Let us now ſpeak a Word or two of the Fruits, ſuch as are deſirable; and how long they ſhould hang upon the Trees and when to Gather them off?</p>

                        <p>Of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Lemon</hi> Trees Planted Abroad in the open Ground.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SINCE it is certain that <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Lemon-Trees</hi> do Naturally grow Abroad in the open Field and plain Earth in Warm and Temperate Countries; and that it is by Art alone we Raiſe and bring them up in <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Caſes</hi> in Climates obnoxious to ſevere Winters: It needs muſt follow, That theſe kind of Trees are more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Thrive in the Firſt way of <hi>Culture,</hi> and where their <hi>Roots</hi> have free ſcope and Liberty to receive abundance of Nouriſhment on every ſide, than by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Artificial Way; where the ſame <hi>Roots</hi> being Reduc'd to a Narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, Impriſon'd as it were, and Surrounded with <hi>Air</hi> capable of ſpoiling them, attain it but in very ſmall proportion.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Planting</hi> therefore and <hi>Cultivation</hi> of theſe Trees, there's no more Myſtery, than in <hi>Planting</hi> of other <hi>Fruit-Trees:</hi> All the Trouble and Difficulty is, how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and ſecure them with <hi>Covering's</hi> during <hi>Winter;</hi> which, beſides their being well and ſubſtantially made, and ſo thick as the Cold cannot penetrate them, are capable of being very Ornamental on the out ſide if well underſtood, and that ſuch as are Able, Curious and Diſcerning, take care and have the diſpoſing of them: That which we every Year ſee, and ſo much admire at <hi>Verſailles</hi> in the Gardens of <hi>Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> may ſerve for Inſtance, and Inſtruction to thoſe who are able to Imitate it.</p>

                     <p>THE ſame Curioſity which made me take Notice of thoſe uſual Faults in <hi>Gard'ning</hi> I have already Diſcourſed of, and Endeavoured to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, has frequently put me upon making Obſervations upon <hi>Plants,</hi> and Engaged me in ſome Natural Diſquiſitions. And now having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thoſe Particular Remarks, and General Conſiderations, which were both the Firſt Ground, and the main Proof of what I here Advance into the Form of a Treatiſe, under the Title of <hi>Reflections,</hi> I think it my Duty to Communicate them to the World.</p>
                     <p>'Tis like they may not Reliſh well with ſome of our New Philoſophers: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were an Extravagant Pretence to Pleaſe every Body. However it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that among ſo many great Wits in this our Enlightened Age, there may be ſome that may obſerve ſomething in them worth their Notice, and thence take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to puſh on their own Enquiries to greater Attainments, then a Perſon of my weak Abilities can Pretend to; for having carefully Employ'd ſo many Years in making ſuch Obſervations upon the ordinary Productions of Nature, as might be ſome ways Serviceable to Perfect the Art of <hi>Gard'ning,</hi> I can hardly think ſo very ill of my own Endeavours, as that they ſhould be deſpiſed by every Body as Uſeleſs and Inſignificant, and that at leaſt my good Intentions ſhould be ſo Unhappy, as not to meet with ſome few that may Approve of them. They will however, I preſume, Accept of this Franc and Ingenuous Account of my Obſervations, and Pardon the weakneſs of my Judgment and Reaſonings thereupon. And with this I ſhall be very well ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>I will therefore begin with an Account of what ſtirr'd up my Curioſity, and firſt put me upon making theſe Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Reflections upon the Different Condition wherein Fruit-Trees appear in thoſe two different Seaſons of the Tear, <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Spring.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF you look upon Fruit-Trees in the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled of the Ornaments of there Fruits and Leaves, and when there appears no ſign of Life in them, as alſo upon ſuch as are newly Planted, you wou'd take them for dead Trunks, or Poles, rather than Live Trees; both of them ſeem to have ſo perfectly loſt the Principle of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> that there appears not the leaſt hopes they ſhould ever Recover themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But then if you look upon them again in the beginning of the <hi>Spring,</hi> when both the Old and the Young ones begin on all ſides, either to Bloſſom or Bud, or put forth <hi>Cions,</hi> you wou'd think they were either performing a kind of Reſurrection, or that they were not really the ſame we lately ſaw in ſo deplorable a Condition; and wherein we ſhall firſt conſider them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe as well as many other things, wou'd doubtleſs be very Surprizing to us, if they were not common in the ordinary Courſe of Nature, and if thoſe continual Miracles were not become ſo familiar to us; though when a Man ſeriouſly conſiders them, he cannot but be much Abaſh'd at his own Ignorance, and very deſirous by all means poſſible to find out the Cauſes, and the Manner of ſuch Alterations.</p>
                     <p>And this Particular affords us Matter for two Nice and Weighty Enquiries: The one is, Whence this Ceſſation of Action proceeds, which makes the Trees all on a ſudden appear Dead when really they are not? And the other is, How that Wonderful Change is Effected, which, a few Months after, puts them into the ſame Courſe of Acting as before; ſo that the Old Trees becoming, in a very little ſpace, as Gay as ever, and the Young ones, as it were after their Example, Shooting out Roots at the one end, and Branches at the other, plainly ſhew, that, quite contrary to what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, they ſtill continued Live Trees? As alſo how they ſhould be always lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame viciſſitudes of Nature: That as <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> make their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Returns, ſo they make our Gardens their Theatre, and as often preſent us with new Scenes? For theſe Trees upon the firſt Nipping Froſt, Return to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame <hi>Deſolate</hi> Condition from which we lately ſaw them Recover themſelves, but as ſoon as ever the Severity of the Weather is over, they, as it were, Conquer and Triumph over their Enemy which had brought them ſo very low, and preſent us with the ſame Beauty and Agreeable Verdure wherewith they had formerly Charmed our Senſes.</p>
                     <p>Now the better to Repreſent to others the Conceptions I have of theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Appearances of Trees, I ſhall Illuſtrate them by Plain, Vulgar and Senſible Compariſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, I imagine an Artificial Tree, of as ſolid a Matter as you pleaſe, of Iron, ſuppoſe, or Copper, and that it ſtands upright, exactly reſembling a real Tree, and having Tubes or Paſſages in all parts of it, the greater for the Uſe of the Trunk, and the leſſer for the Branches and Roots.</p>
                     <p>I imagine further, thoſe Tubs or Paſſages filled either up to the top, or a good way, with Milk.</p>
                     <p>Things thus prepared, I ſuppoſe this Liquor at Reſt, and in its Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, taking up no more ſpace than its ordinary Quantity requires, nor any more at one time than another; but this only ſo long as no External Heat comes near the Tubes. For as ſoon as ever the Heat of the Fire comes near either the ends, or the middle of the Tree, I perceive the Liquor begin to move, to Rarifie, as the Philoſophers ſpeak, or, as we commonly ſay, to Boil up, and to fill a larger ſpace than it did before; ſo that if any part of the Tubes was empty, the Liquor ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as the Heat encreaſes, fills them up; or if they were full at firſt, the Liquor diſcharges it ſelf at the ends of the Tree. And this it does with ſuch force, that if it could find none, it would burſt the Tubes, and make it ſelf a Paſſage out of a place that was not large enough to contain it.</p>
                     <p>Green Wood put in the Fire, and ſending out a kind of Froth at the end as ſoon as ever it begins to Burn, ſeems to me an Ocular Demonſtration of all this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48210:250"/>
Now 'tis certain, that if the Ejected Milky Subſtance thus Rarified be capable of becoming ſolid, it will produce, or rather turn into a kind of New Body, which will not give over growing ſo long as more of the ſame Liquor ſhall ſucceed in the room of that, which after it has been thus Heated, becomes ſolid; but a ſucceſſion of ſuch Operations will produce a Continuation of ſuch Effects.</p>
                     <p>Now by theſe Tubes I would Repreſent the Bark of the Trees, and by the Unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Liquor in them, the Condition of the Sap in Winter, when the Extremity of Cold, which fixes the Motion of the Liquids, and hinders the Natural Effects of Heat, Thickens the Sap, and renders it ſo Unactive, that for want of the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Influence of the Suns Heat upon it, it remains Immoveable; that is, without any Appearance of Action.</p>
                     <p>The Fire warming the Tubes, and, through them, the Liquor incloſed in them, Repreſents the Air and the Earth, which, being in themſelves warmed, do alſo in the very ſame manner warm the real Trees.</p>
                     <p>And this I look upon as the Manner and Order of this Wonderful Operation which we ſee performed every <hi>Spring.</hi> The Air is firſt Heated by the Rays of the Sun, and from it, both the Bark, and the Earth that lyes about the Roots of the Trees receive their Heat, which they immediately Communicate to every part of the <hi>Plant</hi> which they reſpectively Incloſe.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the <hi>Sap</hi> which is Diffuſed throghout the whole Tree but is eſpecially Lodged between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Wood,</hi> where it chiefly operates, and where it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, as it were Dead all the <hi>Winter,</hi> having then no motion at all. This <hi>Sap,</hi> I ſay, as ſoon as ever it comes to feel the Heat of the Sun in the <hi>Spring,</hi> begins firſt to move in its Place, and then to Swell and Rariſy, and to require more room than it took up before; and the Hotter the <hi>Air</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> grows, by the Encreaſing Heat of the Sun, the more it Rarifies and Exerts it ſelf towards all the Branches and Roots of the Tree, that it may get out of that Place where it finds it ſelf too cloſely confin'd. And thus it begins to enter upon a ſtate of Action.</p>
                     <p>But this firſt Motion or Action, begins to appear at the upper End of the Tree firſt, thoſe Parts Heating firſt, as being moſt Expos'd to the Heated <hi>Air,</hi> which does nor till ſome conſiderable time after, reach thoſe Parts that are fixed in the Earth and conſequently thoſe Parts being at Greateſt Diſtance from the <hi>Air,</hi> are the Laſt that are ſenſible of its Heat.</p>
                     <p>But how far ſoever this Agitated <hi>Sap</hi> Reaches, it immediately ſhews what it can do, having this wonderful Quality, that it hardens, and grows ſolid whereſoever it makes its Paſſage out.</p>
                     <p>And indeed this is that which of all others is the moſt Difficult both to Underſtand, and to Explain, whether we take notice of the New Growths, ſimply Conſidered in themſelves, or their Conjunction with and Adheſion to thoſe of the Former Year; or eſpecially the Exactneſs of the Order, and Proportion of thoſe new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions we ſee in the Extreme Parts of each Branch, where we find Leaves break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the ſame diſtance one from another. Thoſe of ſome <hi>Plants</hi> are diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to each other, and of others, at certain diſtances one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And again, ſome Branches are at certain diſtances ſo perfectly divided by Knots, that they ſeem to be Contiguous Bodies, rather than Continued Parts of the ſame Body, as we ſee in the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Elder, &amp;c.</hi> And in general, the Origine of Flowers and Fruits, the Difference of their Colour, Taſt, Shape, and Smell, and the variety of Leaves and Barks afford us matter of the greateſt Wonder and Admiration.</p>
                     <p>Now to give the beſt account we can of all this, let us purſue the working of this Heated <hi>Sap</hi> as far as we are able. We have already ſaid, that its firſt Effects in the <hi>Spring,</hi> do uſually diſcover themſelves in the upper Parts of the Tree, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt Expoſed to the <hi>Air.</hi> Now thoſe Upper Parts are the <hi>Bole</hi> and the <hi>Branches,</hi> whereof the Former is more Maſſive, and the Latter Small and Tender; Upon each of which I conceive the <hi>Sap</hi> Operates after this manner.</p>
                     <p>The latter being Smaller and more Limber, and having a Finer and more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate <hi>Bark,</hi> are more eaſily pierced by the <hi>Air,</hi> than thoſe that are Harder and Larger. And this is the Reaſon why thoſe ſmaller Parts, and eſpecially the Fruit-Buds they ſend forth, are as it were the Fore-runners of the approaching <hi>Spring.</hi> And this appears eſpecially in ſuch Trees as bear <hi>Stone-Fruit,</hi> the Buds whereof are then Perfected, having begun to be Formed at the Latter end of the Fall of the <hi>Sap</hi> the foregoing Year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48210:251"/>
And thus the firſt Action of the <hi>Sap</hi> concludes in Raiſing the Buds, which it opens ſoon after, and at laſt, if the rigour of the Seaſon does not hinder, makes the Fruit to Knot in the Center of the Bud, which after it has been the Subject of the <hi>Gard'ner</hi>'s Hopes and Care, is to recompenſe all his Coſt and Pains.</p>
                     <p>As for the ordinary <hi>Eyes</hi> which appear upon the ſmaller Branches, particularly thoſe of <hi>Core-Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> enlarges ſome of them, thoſe eſpecially that are nearer the End, where its Force is the greateſt; and entering with leſs Impetuoſity into thoſe that grow along the Branches, it at the ſame time ſends forth Leaves, and lays a Foundation for Fruit-Buds againſt the next Year; and thoſe of the laſt years Formation which it finds in any good forwardneſs, it goes on to Perfect the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as for the <hi>Bole</hi> and the largeſt <hi>Boughs,</hi> the firſt Action of the <hi>Sap,</hi> when the lenites is over, and it begins to grow Warm, goes no further than to enlarge ſuch <hi>Eyes</hi> as it finds already Formed, and to begin the <hi>Formation</hi> of New Branches, as ſometimes alſo of New Fruit-Buds, tho' it has not yet received any new ſupply from the Roots. And this is the reaſon, that moſt of the <hi>Branches,</hi> and Trees that are newly Planted, ſprout out in the <hi>Spring,</hi> and ſhew ſome ſigns of Life, tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it cannot thence be certainly concluded that they are really Alive: For theſe ſmall Sprouts are no ſure Proof that the Trees are Recovered, eſpecially at the Lower End, where the great Difficulty lies in producing a good Set of New <hi>Roots:</hi> There lies the great Preſs of the Work of Nature in Recovering the Tree, whereto are required much greater Efforts of the moving <hi>Sap,</hi> than in thoſe Parts of the Tree, that are Expoſed to the <hi>Air.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now ſee what paſſes in the other Element, as ſoon as the Warmth of the <hi>Spring</hi> has Allay'd its Natural Cold, and the Heated <hi>Air</hi> has Imparted its Warmth to the Old <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are therefore to Imagine that, as the <hi>Sap</hi> being moved in the <hi>Bole</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> requires more ſpace than it took up before, ſo, being in the very ſame manner moved in the <hi>Roots,</hi> neither can it be wholly Confined in them; and that as the <hi>Sap</hi> appeared firſt in the Smaller, and then in the Greater <hi>Branches:</hi> So it obſerves the very ſame Method in the <hi>Roots</hi> alſo. The ſwelling <hi>Sap</hi> breaks the <hi>Bark</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, and gets out at every Paſſage it can poſſibly make; and then this, which as well as that above, was Liquid in the Tree, being got out, grows Hard, and aſſumes the Nature and Form of <hi>Roots</hi> in the Earth, juſt as that in the <hi>Branches</hi> becomes Leaves, Fruit, New Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THus then this Firſt and Principal Part of Vegeration begins, Namely, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of <hi>Roots;</hi> Concerning which we are to know that in their firſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they appear White, much like Bubbles of ſome Clammy Fluid, and that they continue of the ſame Colour for ſome days, while they are ſhooting out; and after that, this Whiteneſs which we may call their Native and Infant Colour) turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more Lively one, ſomething Red, which repreſents their Riper ſtate: And while this laſts, all thoſe Greater Operations of the <hi>Roots</hi> are performed. And at laſt, after a certain number of Years, ſucceeds a Dusky and Blackiſh hue, which plainly ſhews them to be in their Declining Age; Inſomuch that thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger able to perform any of their Offices, they become not only Uſeleſs, but alſo ſo Prejudicial to the Tree, that we may fitly Reſemble them to Rotten Teeth in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. For as thoſe, if they be not pull'd out, ſerve only to Torment and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Body: ſo unleſs theſe Decrepit <hi>Roots</hi> be taken away, the Lower Part of the Tree will I anguiſh and Decay. And I have therefore ſhewn, that the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of theſe Old <hi>Roots</hi> is the beſt means of Reſtoring a Languiſhing Tree to its former vigour.</p>
                     <p>Now of theſe <hi>Roots</hi> that firſt ſpring out, ſome are Weak, namely ſuch as are Small; and thoſe that are Thicker are alſo Stronger: And at the ends of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe grow very ſmall Ones, which we commonly call <hi>Fibers.</hi> Theſe laſt ſeldom grow to any Conſiderable Bigneſs; each <hi>Root</hi> acting in Proportion to thoſe ſeveral Degrees of ſtrength or weakneſs, they naturally have at their firſt Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48210:251"/>
And of theſe it may be truly ſaid, that they ſerve but to very little Purpoſe, and that they are of no long Continuance, notwithſtanding all the Care and Pains that many <hi>Gard'ners</hi> take with them. But, for my part, tho' I may have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them, ſo long as they are in the Earth, yet when they are out, and the Trees are to be <hi>Planted</hi> anew, I cut them all quite away. And this way of Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, I endeavour to Juſtifie in another Place, where I treat more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of this matter.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> that ſprung out Large, and Strong, and Good, and took their beginning from a vigorous Principle, which they could not do, if they grew out of others, that were themſelves Small, theſe are the chief Sinews and Strength of the Tree. Theſe, as they encreaſe in Length and Thickneſs, do alſo continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and ſupply more of ſuch new Matter as is proper to be ſent up into the Body of the Tree, both to Produce new Growths, and alſo to Strengthen and Enlarge ſuch as are already Produced at the upper end of it. And to ſuch <hi>Roots</hi> eſpecially it is, that thoſe Trees that Thrive well are beholding for their Beauty, Bulk, and Fruitfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>And here we are to Obſerve, that there are ſome Trees and Plants, wherein that <hi>Sap</hi> which turns to Branches becauſe it goes out at the Upper Part of the Tree, which is Expoſed to the <hi>Air,</hi> would have become <hi>Roots,</hi> if that part of the Tree, where it made it's Paſſage ont, had been cover'd with Earth <hi>&amp; c'eſt ce qui s'appelle Marcoter, ou Provigner.</hi> And contrariwiſe, that Sap which in the parts under ground turns to Roots, would have been Branches, if it had come out above the Surface of the Earth. And I heartily wiſh it were as eaſie to make <hi>Roots</hi> the ſame way in other Trees, as it is in ſetting the Branches of <hi>Vines, Fig-Trees, Quince-Trees, Goosberry-Trees, Myrtle,</hi> and ſome others, for that the Advantages that would thence accrue would be vaſt, and in a manner infinite, will eaſily appear by a General Conſideration, without deſcending to Particulars.</p>
                     <p>And here it may not be Improper to add, That though the Orifices which the Rarify'd Sap makes, be ordinarily either Horizontal, or on the Lower ſide of the <hi>Root,</hi> yet ſometimes they happen to be on the Upper ſide, and inſtead of <hi>Roots,</hi> ſend forth <hi>Shoots,</hi> which grow up into New Trees. This Obſervation is as certain as the former, and yet I am ſo far from Demonſtrating to others how the different Situation of thoſe Orifices alone ſhould be the Cauſe of ſuch different Effects, that I Ingenuouſly confeſs I could never find out a Reaſon ſufficient to ſatisfie my ſelf therein.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Production of the <hi>Roots,</hi> it is eaſie to imagine how they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Length and Thickneſs, by comparing them to a Stream of Water, which grows longer and broader, and ſtronger, according as the <hi>Spring,</hi> from whence it ariſes, ſupplies it with a greater quantity of Water: For juſt after the ſame manner, the Sap aſcending continually from the <hi>Roots</hi> to the upper parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> is made uſe of in all thoſe New Productions we there behold.</p>
                     <p>But I could never yet think of any Material Agent, that might in the leaſt Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the manner how the <hi>Roots,</hi> thoſe eſpecially of Trees Newly Planted, do at the ſame time Grow themſelves, and Convey Sap to their Trees. And if I were not afraid of Diſparaging the Glorious Nature of the Angels, I ſhould borrow a Parallel from them, to make my Conceptions in this Matter the better underſtood: For indeed, thoſe Spiritual Beings Act with all poſſible Perfection, from the very firſt Moment their Creation has given them an Exiſtence. And in like manner, theſe New <hi>Roots</hi> no ſooner appear out of the Old ones, but they immediately enter upon Action in ſearching out their own Nouriſhment, and by their Action, which begins as ſoon as ever they begin to be, they contribute towards their own Encreaſe in Largneſs and Number; and after the very ſame manner they make the Tree which they Support, equally to Encreaſe in Thickneſs and Length, in number of Branches, and quantity of Fruit. And in ſhort, to the great Aſtoniſhment of him that Conſiders them, they all on a ſudden, and that too in the very ſame Action, Effect their own, and the Good of the whole Tree.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Sett of New <hi>Roots</hi> that the Rarified Sap produces, are not only Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Feeding themſelves, and the Tree out of which they grow, but they alſo immediately Contribute to the Production of a ſecond Courſe of <hi>Roots</hi> which grow out at their ends, and are in all reſpects like themſelves, and whereby they alſo become both Larger and Stronger; and by the Joint-force of both, the whole <hi>Root</hi> of the Tree becomes Longer and better Fortify'd. And, which is yet more wonderful, this ſecond Range both contributes to the Feeding and Enlarging the firſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48210:252"/>
from which they Sprang, and alſo by a continued Courſe of Acting grow bigger themſelves, and joining with the former, produce a third Courſe of little <hi>Roots,</hi> growing out of their Extremities, and ſo cloſely Link'd, Interwoven, and as it were Incorporated into the two former, as that it is not poſſible to Looſe and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle them; all which three New <hi>Growths</hi> make up one Body of <hi>Roots,</hi> which is then more able to Act than it was at any time before.</p>
                     <p>And after that thoſe two former <hi>Growths</hi> have, as I may ſay, given Being to this third, they both receive from it that Supply which before the firſt receiv'd from the ſecond; and theſe continually Enlarging themſelves by an endleſs Succeſſion of ſuch New Productions, and Mutually doing to, and receiving from each other thoſe good Offices that preſerve them, they alſo preſerve the Tree in all its parts Alive and Vigorous.</p>
                     <p>But after all, I muſt confeſs I cannot fully Comprehend this continued Miracle of Nature in <hi>Vegetables.</hi> I ſee plainly, that from the Rarefaction of the Sap the firſt Roots have their Being; but conſidering them as they Live and Mutually Act, I find it a very difficult Matter to Account for the Acting either of the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or any of the following Growths, ſo immediately after they are formed, for they cannot be Idle and Unactive one Moment after they begin to be formed ſince that might make them Dye, and thereupon the whole Tree wou'd certainly Dye alſo.</p>
                     <p>And what is thus performed in the firſt Production of Roots, may be illuſtrated by comparing it with the Lighting of a Torch, that will in ſome meaſure help our Conception of this firſt Act of <hi>Vegitation.</hi>—The Torch continues wholly Uſeleſs and Unactive in the place that contains it, till a little Fire and Flame, apply'd to it from ſome other Matter, put it into a Condition of Burning and Flaming it Self; the firſt Fire and Flame by their own Vertue and Action, encreaſing in the Torch to which they are Communicated.</p>
                     <p>Juſt ſo the Tree remains Unactive, and without any Vegetative Motion in the Earth, 'til by the Aſſiſtance of ſomething elſe, that is, By the Efforts of Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, its Principle of Life having made ſome ſmall Beginnings of new Roots at the ends of thoſe old ones it had before, it at the ſame time begins to perform all the Offices of a Live Tree, thoſe new Roots encreaſing and enlarging themſelves by their own Operations.</p>
                     <p>And, as in the former Caſe, the Encreaſe of the firſt Fire and Flame proceeds from their Acting, which having melted down ſomething a greater quantity of the Neighbouring Matter that is proper for it to Work upon, it furniſhes both the Fire and the Flame with more Fuel, and conſequently puts both into a Condition of Acting more vigorouſly.</p>
                     <p>After the very ſame manner the firſt Root being Enliven'd by the Aſſiſtance of Rarefaction, which gave it its Being, it enlarges it ſelf to ſuch a Degree, that having got together a large quantity of new Sap, and becoming thereby ſtronger and better able to perform that kind of Action, it at laſt produces a great number of other <hi>Roots;</hi> by means whereof, the whole Tree becomes more Beautiful, Large and Vigorous.</p>
                     <p>We eaſily perceive that in the Torch, the greater the Heat is the more Matter it melts down; and we obſerve alſo, that that melted Matter ſerves to encreaſe the ſame Heat that melted it; and that the Heat thus encreaſed has ſtill a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Subtilize the Matter upon which it Acts, and to turn it into a proportionably thinner Vapour and Exhalation, and conſequently to make a large Flame bigger; and that this Augmented Flame does again encreaſe the Heat that produc'd it: And thus we ſee a Circulation of Actions and Re-actions perform'd by the Heat, the Flame, and the Fuel.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, as in the Torch the more Matter the Fire Acts upon, the clearer the Flame is; ſo the More and the Better <hi>Roots</hi> the Trees ſend forth, the larger the Branches alſo are, and the longer they are like to live.</p>
                     <p>And this is the Reaſon alſo, why Trees ſtanding alone have a much greater number of Roots than thoſe that are ſet againſt a Wall; becauſe theſe latter have Roots only on one, whereas the other have them on all ſides. From whence alſo it comes to paſs, that the former do uſually much exceed the latter, both in Height, Thickneſs and Duration.</p>
                     <p>And although the Principle of Life, which makes the Roots to Act, be at firſt the ſame in both, juſt as the Fire that Lights a great Torch is the ſame that Lights a little one, yet this Principle of Life ſeems to grow ſtronger in a Tree that ſends forth many Roots, than in one that ſends forth but a few; each Root according to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48210:252"/>
its firſt Natural ſtrength and bigneſs, growing as it were a particular and diſtinct Agent: So that each Preſerving and Improving thoſe Aſſiſtances which it hath, and ſtill does receive from the Principle of Life, and without which it would remain void of all manner of Action, it every day Acts more vigorouſly, and does really encreaſe its power of Acting in proportion to its Length and Thickneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it Multiplies it ſelf; which it does after the very ſame manner that the firſt Fire, and the firſt Flame of a Torch grows ſtronger by the ſupply of new Fuel, which they prepare themſelves by continually encreaſing their Heat and Light; and in both, the larger the Matter is, the greater is the Action; only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That whereas the firſt Fire, and the firſt Flame, do both periſh at the ſame time that that firſt Matter which gave them Being is Conſumed, and as one may ſay, Annihilated, the Tree's Principle of Life ſtill ſubſiſts after it has loſt ſome of its Roots. Nay, we ſee that the taking ſome of them away proves the moſt effectual Means of making it Grow and Flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore lay down this as a certain Truth in the Courſe of Nature, That in every Plant there is a certain Principle of Life, which continuing the Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, does alſo continue both the Being and the Action of the Roots in their Formation: That 'tis this Inward Principle, which Co-operating with each of them in thoſe Offices which Nature has Aſſigned them, Aſſiſts them in performing what otherwiſe it were impoſſible for them to Effect; and conſequently, that 'tis this Principle alone that gives theſe Roots a Power either to Attract, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall hereafter give my Opinion in this Grand Queſtion concerning the Action of the Roots; at preſent I ſhall only ſay, That there are but very few Roots that are able to Act of themſelves, and when they are once ſever'd from the Trees with which they were formed; I only ſay ſever'd; for of Roots firſt pluck'd up, and then ſet again, I know not whether any are able to Recover themſelves, and to Act again: And though the principal <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Elms, Roſe-Trees, Vines, Fig-Trees, Raspiſh-Buſhes,</hi> and ſome other very ſprightly <hi>Shrubs,</hi> may ſometimes ſend forth at that end which was next to the Tree from which they were Cut off, ſuch <hi>Sprouts</hi> as may become <hi>Elms, Roſe-Trees, Vines,</hi> &amp;c. yet 'tis certain that this is a Privilege peculiar to themſelves, ſo that we cannot draw any General Conſequence from them, that the <hi>Roots</hi> of other Trees and Plants may do the ſame; and upon the whole we may conclude, that there is in every Tree a certain Principle of Life which makes its <hi>Roots</hi> to Act, and that too to the utmoſt of their Power and Capacity.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo allow that in reſpect of this Principle of Life, as well as of the Soil, there is a vaſt difference between Trees: The Heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> being equal in it ſelf, does equally Heat a piece of Ground equally Good in it ſelf, and equally Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to its Rays, as it does alſo all the Trees that are Planted in it, and yet, though they ſeemed all in good Condition when they were Set, ſome of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Roots</hi> in abundance, and others none at all, but Languiſh and Dye.</p>
                     <p>Which failure muſt ordinarily be Aſcribed to the Trees themſelves, and not to the Ground, which we ſuppoſed equally well Qualified, nor to the Sun which alſo Acts equally upon both It, and Them.</p>
                     <p>The Planted Trees therefore do chiefly Act by their Principle of Life, ſince it is that which being Animated by the Heat, makes the old <hi>Roots</hi> ſend forth Young ones; to the Actings whereof the Trees are obliged for that conſtant Supply of Nouriſhment which preſerves and makes them Grow. Cuſtom has fix'd the Name of <hi>Sap</hi> upon this Nouriſhment, and therefore we ſhall commonly call it ſo, as often as we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEfore I proceed to a cloſer Diſquiſition about the Nature of <hi>Sap,</hi> which is the ſame in Plants that Chile; or Blood are in Animals, the Water in the Bowels of the Earth being alſo the ſame to Plants, that Food in the Stomach is to Animals, it may be requiſite to obſerve, that as the Earth ſerves to produce, and nouriſh <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi> as having in it a Virtue or Principle of Fertility neceſſary for ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, ſo 'tis alſo certain that of it ſelf, and unleſs it be duly moiſtened it cannot
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48210:253"/>
perform thoſe Offices. Juſt as <hi>Sené,</hi> which being of a Purging Nature, does not operate of it ſelf, but by means of a proportionate quantity of Water, or ſome other Liquid, wherein it is Infus'd, and to which, by that Infuſion, it Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its Vertue. But as this Purging Quality becomes altogether Ineffectual, if the proportion of Water be too great for the Quantity of the <hi>Sené,</hi> ſo alſo the Earth becomes Unfruitful, and Rots Fruit-Trees, as well as moſt other Plants, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be Drench'd or Cover'd with Water. It requires ſome, but not too much Moiſture; and too much Wet is altogether as Prejudicial, as too much Drought.</p>
                     <p>Now whereſoever the Earth is too Dry, it is neceſſarily Barren: and therefore all the Ground we commonly call Good, is attended with all ſorts of Moiſture, which indeed is nothing elſe but real Water diffus'd through every part of the Ground. And this Water comes for the moſt part, either from Rain, or Snow, or Rivers, or Springs, and ſometimes by Artificial Conveyances; which Water having by its Weight ſunk into, and diffuſed it ſelf through all parts of the Earth, it becomes, as Philoſophers ſpeak, Impregnated with the <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Fertile Salt</hi> of that Earth: Or, to uſe the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Term, it becomes ſo far Seaſoned with the Quality of that Earth, as to aſſume its Taſte, whatſoever it be, which it Communicates to thoſe Plants it Nouriſhes. The Truth of which Obſervation is ſufficiently Evinced from Experience in Wines, and ſeveral ſorts of Fruits, which receive different Taſtes from the different Soils they Grow in.</p>
                     <p>One part of this Impregnated Moiſture, whether its Tincture be perceiveable by Senſe or not, ſerves to make Minerals and Fountains: And another part, as we have juſt now ſaid, goes to the Production and Nouriſhment of a Thouſand ſeveral ſorts of Trees, and Plants, and Vegetables; it being in every Earth of ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as may ſerve for the uſe of all ſorts of Trees and Plants, and is, in effect, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that Water we are going to Treat of, though it immediately appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different both in Colour, Taſte, and Conſiſtency, as ſoon as ever it has, by the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> enter'd into the ſeveral Plants, and that it ceaſes to be pure and ſimple Water.</p>
                     <p>For whereas it was at firſt Liquid, before it enter'd the <hi>Roots,</hi> it becomes in time, and by degrees, in a manner perfectly Hard, and as it were Metamorphoſed into the Nature either of <hi>Fruits</hi> or <hi>Leaves,</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Bark,</hi> or <hi>Pith;</hi> and there makes a Body more or leſs Hard, according as it happens to be diſpos'd of into the ſeveral <hi>Fruits, Trees,</hi> or <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hence perhaps it comes that the Simple Dew, which is ſprinkled upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Flowers in Gardens and Meadows, becomes changed, part into <hi>Honey,</hi> part into <hi>Wax,</hi> and part into little thin <hi>Coats,</hi> as ſoon as the <hi>Bees</hi> have with their uſual Induſtry Collected, and by the Inſtinct and Direction of Nature, Wrought and Separated it.</p>
                     <p>Now this Hardening of the <hi>Sap</hi> is not to be Aſcribed to any Quality peculiar to it ſelf, ſince 'tis no more than what the <hi>Skin</hi> in <hi>Fruits,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> in Trees may be ſuppoſed to effect, for both of them are in all likelihood made up of the groſſer parts of the <hi>Sap;</hi> and it is eaſie to imagine that they may have a Power of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their own Denſity to the <hi>Sap,</hi> when their inward parts come to be Bathed and Drench'd in it. As for inſtance, When the <hi>Sap</hi> paſſing between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> not only Aſcends, by a kind of Filtration, up to the top of the <hi>Plant,</hi> but alſo, if it be in a ſufficient Quantity, riſes even above the top, and adds ſomething to the length of it.</p>
                     <p>This therefore muſt be Aſcribed to the Vertue of the <hi>Bark,</hi> which in Trees makes this <hi>Sap</hi> ſo Hard and Durable, that it cannot be Diſſolv'd, but by a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in ſome Corroding or Putrifying Moiſture; and to the <hi>Skins,</hi> which in <hi>Fruits</hi> makes only a kind of Congelation, and ſuch a one as is eaſily Diſſolv'd, either by Chewing, or any ſort of Heat, or by violent Bruiſing.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt apply'd to all the ſides of a Veſſel full of Liquor, and then encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Ice, has altogether the ſame Vertue of Congealing the Liquor in the Veſſel. And thus the Induſtry of Perſons of Qualities Servants furniſh them in the Heat of Summer with ſeveral ſorts of Artificial <hi>Snows,</hi> and delightful <hi>Coolers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But after all, there remains one very great Difficulty, How both the <hi>Skin,</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> themſelves grow Hard, and how they afterwards encreaſe and enlarge themſelves. This, I muſt confeſs, paſſes my Skill, as indeed do moſt other things in the whole Courſe of <hi>Vegetation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is this all, namely, That the Water being made <hi>Sap</hi> by the Action of the <hi>Roots,</hi> turns by degrees into a ſolid Body, but it alſo undergoes ſeveral other Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48210:253"/>
which are no leſs Wonderful than the former: For one part of it grows Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as when it is to make an <hi>Onion,</hi> a <hi>Leek, Wormwood,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>But above all, How can a Man chooſe but be wonderfully aſtoniſh'd when he Conſiders how that which is nothing elſe but a ſweetiſh, ſimple, and harmleſs Juice, when it comes firſt to be Lodg'd in the ſeveral Cells of the Grape, ſhou'd, when it is out, make ſo Rich, ſo Strong, and ſo Noble a Liquor.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſtrange indeed that this ſimple Juice, upon its paſſage out of thoſe Natural Cells (where it firſt Contracted ſuch an extream ſharpneſs, and then by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Mellow by the Heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which manag'd the whole proceſs of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening) being in a great quantity Collected and Shut up in a Veſſel, ſhou'd paſs ſuch a wonderful Change as makes it the Delight of Mankind; for no ſooner is it in the Veſſel than it begins to Ferment, and to Boil up, juſt as if its parts were forced up by the Heat of an External Fire; and by the violence of this Natural Agitation it ſo Purges it ſelf, and comes to ſuch a Perfection, as we ſhou'd certainly judge Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, if we were not Convinc'd by Experience.</p>
                     <p>But beſides all this we are to obſerve, That this <hi>Sap</hi> which in the <hi>Stocks</hi> of ſuch Trees, for Inſtance, as bear <hi>Core-Fruit,</hi> is Inſipid, and the very ſame in all ſorts of ſuch Trees, becomes of a quite different Taſte in the ſeveral Fruits which each of thoſe Trees do reſpectively bear. It has a Flavour in ſome which it has not in others; it has a Sweet and Sugariſh Taſte in the <hi>Bergamot-Pear</hi> and <hi>Bon-Chretien,</hi> and an Eager and Harſh one in the <hi>Franc-real</hi> and <hi>Angober,</hi> &amp;c. And that which in the <hi>Quince-Tree</hi> naturally produces a Hard, Sharp, and Unpleaſant Fruit, if it go out at one ſide of the Tree into a <hi>Graff</hi> of a <hi>Butter-Pear,</hi> or <hi>Ambrette,</hi> will produce a Sweet Mellow Fruit, and at the other into an <hi>Amadote,</hi> or <hi>Robin,</hi> and the great <hi>Musk,</hi> a Wateriſh and well Scented Fruit, the different <hi>Graffs</hi> in ſome Trees ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and altering the <hi>Sap</hi> that comes from the <hi>Roots,</hi> much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in Water-works the Inſtruments do the Water that comes from the elevated Source, the Water of each of thoſe Artificial Fountains being Naturally alike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Repreſent any Figure whatſoever, of a <hi>Drinking-Glaſs,</hi> for inſtance, a <hi>Crown, Flower-de-Liz,</hi> &amp;c. according to the Difference of the Inſtruments, upon the opening whereof, it being forced out by its own Weight, riſes up in various forms.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Stoek</hi> of a <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> being equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to make any kind of Fruit, is by means of the <hi>Graffs</hi> determin'd to this or that ſort in particular.</p>
                     <p>And the particular Alterations which the <hi>Sap</hi> undergoes by reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Trees it enters, are no leſs Wonderful than Infinite.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Juggler,</hi> who of Simple Water which he Drinks Vomits up ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Water, all differing in Colour, Taſte, and Smell, performs by Art what nearly reſembles the Working of Nature in thoſe <hi>Stocks</hi> whereon the ſlips of ſeveral Trees are <hi>Graffed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now of this <hi>Sap,</hi> which may properly be ſaid to be nothing elſe but Water prepar'd by the <hi>Roots,</hi> ſome part may indeed enter into the very Body of the Tree for its Support, as I have already ſaid; but the greateſt part of it goes up, chiefly between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Wood,</hi> either to make ſome new Addition in the Height or Thickneſs of the Tree it ſelf, or to produce <hi>Leaves, Flowers, Fruits,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the Paſſage of the <hi>Sap.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Arguments we have to prove that the <hi>Sap</hi> aſcends principally between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> are grounded upon a vaſt number of undeniable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; whereof the firſt is that of <hi>Graffs.</hi> Now it is certain that theſe <hi>Graffs</hi> are not rightly apply'd, but between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Tree; and that the Experiment wou'd not ſucceed, unleſs the Slip, or little Branch, that is to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed, have its Bark likewiſe; and that they be ſo exactly plac'd one againſt the other, that the aſcending <hi>Sap</hi> may paſs under the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Graff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is only the <hi>Vine</hi> that is <hi>Graffed</hi> without ſuch an exact fitting of the <hi>Barks;</hi> and indeed, to ſpeak properly, it has no <hi>Bark;</hi> for the Body of it being ſo Porous, that the <hi>Sap</hi> aſcends in great quantity both athwart, and into every part, as well of the <hi>Bole</hi> as the <hi>Branches,</hi> it ſeems to Suck in in the Spring, more Nouriſhment than any other Plant we know of; and has alſo a power of Digeſting it; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that upon its iſſuing out of the Stock, which it eaſily does by any the leaſt Inciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on you can make in it, it will keep a long time without Corrupting, being in that very different from the <hi>Sap</hi> of <hi>Stone-Fruit-Trees,</hi> which will not keep much longer out of its Tree than the Blood of Animals out of their Bodies, but turns to Slime and Putrefaction, as ſoon as it is out of its Natural Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>There is, I ſay, no Plant, but only the <hi>Vine,</hi> that can be Graffed by a ſimple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into the Body of another Plant, without an exact fitting of the <hi>Barks</hi> to each other, nor indeed is a <hi>Vine-</hi>ſlip capable of being ſo juſtly Adapted. 'Tis true indeed all other Trees might be Graffed the ſame way as the <hi>Vine</hi> is, if in them as in the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> paſs'd up the <hi>Bole</hi> in ſuch a quantity as were ſufficient to join and incorporate the <hi>Graff</hi> into the Tree, which it does not.</p>
                     <p>Hence alſo it comes that as the <hi>Sap</hi> never paſſes out of ſuch new Branches in any part of the ſides of the Tree as are without <hi>Bark,</hi> ſo neither will it ever paſs out of the middle of the <hi>Bole</hi> when the upper part of the Tree is cut of, or of the Branches that are crop'd, or of any <hi>Stock</hi> when the Tree is cut down; whereas ordinarily about the end of any ſuch cut Tree or Branch having <hi>Bark,</hi> that being the place whither all the <hi>Sap</hi> that was prepar'd in the <hi>Root</hi> chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects its courſe, it there forms a great number of Branches which break through the <hi>Bark,</hi> and in their formation faſten upon that part of the Tree which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Breach they have made in the <hi>Bark;</hi> though theſe Branches are not near ſo firmly united to the Tree, as thoſe are to an old Branch which the <hi>Sap</hi> produces at the end of it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument to prove that a great part of the <hi>Sap</hi> paſſes up between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark,</hi> may be taken from the quantity of Water which goes out at the ends of a piece of Wood while it is in burning; and eſpecially if you burn it ſoon after it has been cut off from the <hi>Stock</hi> that nouriſhed it, for this Liquor iſſuing out like a whitiſh Froth, and bubling out from between the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Bark,</hi> falls down and turns to perfect Water.</p>
                     <p>From whence I conclude, that this is nothing elſe but the diſſolving of the ſame <hi>Sap,</hi> which having paſſed through the <hi>Roots,</hi> was formerly the Nutriment of the Tree, differing now from what it was then only in this, that whereas the Moiſture upon its entrance into the <hi>Roots,</hi> was by the acting of the <hi>Roots</hi> render'd capable of aſſuming the Nature and Quality of ſuch <hi>Sap</hi> as was proper for ſuch or ſuch Trees, becomes of ſomewhat a thicker conſiſtency, when the Branch which it was to have fed and enlarg'd, is ſever'd from the Live Tree to which it belong'd, or when the whole Tree is pluck'd up by the <hi>Roots.</hi> In either of theſe caſes it is ſo, as it were laid to Sleep, that it may be preſerv'd whole Years without any Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, provided the Tree or Branch be kept in a place that is moderately warm and moiſt; inſomuch that ſuch a Tree or Branch coming at the Years end to be ſet again in a good Earth, or <hi>Graffed</hi> upon a good <hi>Stock,</hi> and to have the benefit of a warm <hi>Sun,</hi> flouriſhes as well as thoſe that were never remov'd out of the places where they firſt grew. All which is ſufficiently confirmed by Experience in <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Graffs,</hi> we receive ſafe and ſound from Foreign Parts; and in others, which at certain Seaſons of the Year we ſend thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48210:254"/>
But if inſtead of Replanting this Tree, or making uſe of this Branch for a <hi>Graff,</hi> you put them into the Fire, you will ſee that part of the <hi>Sap</hi> which was not turn'd into the ſubſtance of the Tree, but only a little thicken'd for want of Action, as ſoon as it comes to be heated by the Fire, firſt to grow thin, and then to Rarifie it ſelf to ſuch a degree as to paſs out at the ends of the Tree or Branch in a thouſand little Sources; and that Liquor, which before its entrance into the Tree was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing but Water, and which afterwards ſuffer'd ſo many Alterations both in Colour and Taſte, and Conſiſtency, and other Qualities, recovers the Natural ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity it had before it enter'd the Tree, without any Remains of the Effects of thoſe great Changes it had undergone, except only a little ſharpneſs in the Smoak, which doubtleſs is only Accidental, and to be aſcrib'd to the Fire, by which thoſe pieces of Wood are conſumed.</p>
                     <p>I know very well that 'tis not only from between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark</hi> that the Fire makes this Rarified Water to paſs out, but that it does the ſame alſo at the ends of all the inward parts of the <hi>Wood</hi> ſucceſſively and circularly, as it were one Lair after another; which it does according as the Heat advancing reaches by degrees, and in a circular manner, the inner parts of the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet this is ſo far from deſtroying my Hypotheſis, that the <hi>Sap</hi> paſſes up chiefly between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark,</hi> that it mightily confirms it. For every one of the inward parts of the Tree having been in their turn, next to the <hi>Bark,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently each ſoaked in the <hi>Sap</hi> which paſſed by it, and indeed being it ſelf nothing elſe but <hi>Sap</hi> condenſed, it is no ſtrange thing to ſee it in its Diſſolution return to the ſame Matter of which it was at firſt made. And for the further proof of this Opinion, I have two Arguments to offer, both which ſeem to me very ſtrong and cogent.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that as it is the <hi>Sap</hi> which being for a time grown thick, and as it were cold, ſo ſtrongly glues and joins the <hi>Bark</hi> to the <hi>Wood,</hi> that they are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily pull'd aſunder; ſo upon its being heated either by the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the Spring or Summer, or by our common Fire, they become eaſily ſeparable. And this is eaſily concieveable to every one that conſiders that almoſt the very ſame thing is every day done in the uſe of common Glue.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond, you need only take a view of the inſide of the <hi>Bark,</hi> and the outſide of the Tree, and you will percieve in both an infinite number of little Gutters or Chanels which are ſeparated from each other by as many little Partitions, which ſerve to faſten the <hi>Bark</hi> to the Tree, and to be Paſſages for the <hi>Sap</hi> to aſcend up to the very top, both to be a continual Supply to all the ſeveral parts of the Tree, and to add new Growths to ſuch Parts as are capable of Enlargement.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving all thoſe little Chanels which in every part of the <hi>Wood</hi> appear croſs-wiſe from the <hi>Pith</hi> to the <hi>Bark,</hi> like ſo many ſtraight Lines drawn from the Center of a Circle to its Circumference, or the <hi>Sun</hi> as Painters uſe to draw it, and which are plainly ſeen in cutting a Turnip through the middle, I know not whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of aſſigning the <hi>Saps</hi> paſſage up into the Body of the Tree through the <hi>Fibres</hi> of it, I may not as reaſonably conclude, That theſe are the real Paſſages by which the <hi>Sap</hi> (which as I have already proved is Lodged, and performs moſt of its Actions between the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Bark)</hi> is conveyed into the Body of the Tree, to refreſh and feed all the inward Parts of it, ſince I cannot poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for what other Uſe Nature ſhou'd have intended thoſe little Chanels which are made with ſo much Exactneſs and Curioſity.</p>
                     <p>I have already obſerved, in ſpeaking of the Water which becomes <hi>Sap</hi> by the Operation of the <hi>Roots,</hi> that it undergoes a great variety of Alterations in the ſeveral Plants into which it is received.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the Cauſe of the Difference in <hi>Saps,</hi> and upon the Effects produced by <hi>Engraffing.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Opinion of our Modern Philoſophers, who aſcribe the great difference that is in <hi>Saps, as well as in other Sublunary Bodies,</hi> to the difference of Pores, is indeed very Ingenious and Pretty: But for my part, I muſt own, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. I cannot imagine how a Poiſonous Juice ſhou'd become wholeſom, an Inſipid Sweet, or a ſtinking one well ſcented, meerly by changing its Place;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48210:255"/>
and how its being in certain Pores of ſuch a Figure made it one thing, and then its paſſing thence into others of another Figure, ſhou'd make it the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, I ſhou'd make no great difficulty of agreeing with ſo many Ingenious Perſons as maintain this Doctrine of <hi>Pores,</hi> if they wou'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to give as good an account how the great Changes we ſee in Trees by the means of <hi>Graffs,</hi> might be perform'd the ſame way. I confeſs the Compariſon between this performance of Nature, and that of a Water Engine, appears very fit for their purpoſe. It appears at firſt ſight to have ſo much of Demonſtration in it, as may perhaps Puzzle a Man, but I dare ſay, can never perſwade or convince him. The Workings of Nature in the <hi>Graffs</hi> are too dark and intricate to be thereby ſufficiently illuſtrated; and the particulars wherein they plainly diſagree, do vaſtly exceed thoſe wherein they ſeem to agree, and for which the Fancy was ſo much Applauded, as will appear by inſiſting upon ſome particulars, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what light this way of Explication can give us therein.</p>
                     <p>The force of the Water-Inſtrument, the more it is uſed, the weaker it grows, and at laſt quite ſpends it ſelf; whereas on the contrary, that of the <hi>Graff,</hi> the more it is Employ'd, the ſtronger it grows.</p>
                     <p>Again, each of thoſe Inſtruments can repreſent but one ſort of Figure, while every <hi>Graffed</hi> Slip produces a vaſt number of diſtinct Effects, and all differing from one another. As for Inſtance, The <hi>Bark</hi> produces <hi>Wood, Leaves, Flowers, Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. which Fruits do alſo differ in their Colour, Shape, Taſte, Meat and Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Add hereto, that the Slip in producing an infinite number of other Slips, does alſo produce a like number of new Inſtruments for the conveyance of its <hi>Sap;</hi> a thing which our Water-Engines cannot any ways be ſaid to do, ſeeing they are incapable of Multiplying themſelves. As alſo, laſtly, That any Water-Engine will ſerve for all ſorts of Water, whereas each Slip is Reſtrained and Limited to one particular ſort of Fruit: Thoſe, for inſtance, of a <hi>Core-Fruit-</hi>Tree, ſerving only for the Production of ſuch Fruit, and it being impoſſible to employ thoſe of any ſort of Tree in producing the Fruit of another.</p>
                     <p>And now what Convincing Arguments does this Compariſon bring along with it? And how does it make it barely poſſible, that a ſmaller number of Pores ſhou'd of themſelves be able to alter the Diſpoſition of a much greater number of quite contrary Pores?</p>
                     <p>But that which ſtill adds to the Difficulty is, That the ſmaller number of Pores in the Slip being, as I may ſay, become Strangers, Weak, and in ſome ſort already Alter'd by its <hi>Inoculation,</hi> whereas the greater number of Pores in the Tree are, as it were, at Home, and ſupported by a ſtrong and vigorous Stock, one wou'd ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the former ſhou'd ſubmit to the latter, and yield to the Impreſſions which the ſtronger ſhou'd, according to the Courſe of Nature, make upon the weaker. But here we ſee the quite contrary, the ſtronger ſhamefully ſubmitting, and all the Glory and Advantage on the weaker's ſide; that a poor Slip pull'd from the Tree whereon it grew, and deprived of all Aſſiſtance from it, which one wou'd think abſolutely Neceſſary at leaſt to preſerve it in its Specific Being, and having nothing but a little of its Native <hi>Sap,</hi> ſhou'd not only Live, and Preſerve its own Species, but alſo be able as it were to Maſter that ſo much greater quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> with which it Mixes, <hi>That this ſmall Stream ſhou'd ſtop the Violence of ſo mighty a Torrent, and keep it ſelf within its own narrow Bounds, instead of being hurried away by the Violence of the Current to which it is joined.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The vigorous <hi>Stock</hi> was, by the particular manner of its Action upon the <hi>Sap,</hi> which its <hi>Roots</hi> had prepared about to produce a Fruit of ſuch a Taſte, Colour, Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>Sap</hi> finding one or more <hi>Graffs</hi> in its paſſage up the Tree, accommodates it ſelf to them, and produces both Trees and Fruits of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature.</p>
                     <p>Thus a <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> for Example, about to produce <hi>Quinces,</hi> which every Body knows to be a Hard, Harſh, Gritty, and Unpleaſant Fruit, produces a vaſt number of very good and ſweet <hi>Pears;</hi> and an <hi>Almond-Tree,</hi> which Naturally bears only <hi>Almonds,</hi> is thus made to bear <hi>Plumbs, Apricots,</hi> &amp;c. And all this by means of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Slips, which being, as I may ſo ſay, endued with a Commanding Power, and preſenting themſelves to the aſcending <hi>Sap,</hi> oblige it to paſs according to their Directions, and Subject it to all thoſe ſeveral Alterations which we daily ſee in <hi>Graffed</hi> Trees.</p>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48210:255"/>
Now the better to comprehend how this little <hi>Graff</hi> Works, and by what Power of Nature it ſerves it ſelf ſo advantagiouſly of that Maſs of Matter which were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to drown and deſtroy it, or at leaſt make it ſubmit to it, we may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly reſemble it to a weak Child, and one that is not of the Royal Blood, placed at the Head of an Army at the ſame time that it is Engaged. The Army continues reſolutely to purſue the Orders it received from its General, till the Young Succeſſor coming to give New Orders, Employs its Force and Courage in the Execution of a quite contrary Deſign. Now that which enables this New Commander, who is yet a Child, thus all on a ſudden to put the whole Army upon a different Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, can be nothing elſe but a certain Character of Majeſty which he carries in his Perſon, which makes the Army, how Numerous and Brave, and how Hot ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was upon another Deſign, at the very firſt to Acknowledge his Sovereign Authority, blindly to follow, and without any manner of Reluctancy to Execute his Orders; though perhaps it may not do ſo very long, no longer than till another New Commander ſhall get the ſame Advantage over him, which he had over the firſt. All which we ſee in ſome ſort performed by the <hi>Sap</hi> of the <hi>Graff,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has prevailed over that of the Tree, comes it ſelf to be ſubject to that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet upon it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But yet after all it muſt be owned, that though there be nothing either more common or more eaſie than Engraffing, there is nothing in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Vegetables</hi> that is more Wonderful, or harder to be Underſtood than it.</p>
                     <p>It ſhou'd ſeem that Nature has here placed the bounds of our Curioſity, Dazling our Sight when it wou'd pierce any farther, thinking it ſufficient we ſhou'd know how to apply the Agent and the Patient together, without diſcovering the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner of that Action whereby ſuch Wonderful Effects are produced; and perhaps if we knew it, we ſhou'd not be much better <hi>Graffers</hi> than we now are without that Knowledge: And a ſmall Experience is ſufficient to teach us both the Manner and the Succeſs of every kind of <hi>Graffs</hi> in all ſorts of Fruits. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be content to make the beſt Uſe we can of what we know already in this Particular, without ſpending time in endeavouring to advance our Knowledge fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein. Let us fix our Thoughts upon ſome other Things, which may be conſider'd with leſs Difficulty and more Advantage, and endeavour to diſcover ſomething that may be of uſe to us in the Better and Quicker Improvement of them.</p>
                     <p>From all that has been thus far Diſcourſed upon this Subject of <hi>Graffs,</hi> I cannot but conclude, That there muſt of Neceſſity be ſomething more extraordinary in all this than what can be aſcribed to the bare meeting together of certain Pores, ſome of one Figure, and ſome of another.</p>

And when I alſo obſerve ſome valuable Fruits, ſuch as <hi>Figs, Perdrigons, Peaches,</hi> &amp;c. expoſed to all the Injuries both of Air and Animals, without any other Defence than that of a little, thin and delicate Skin, while the <hi>Cheſnut,</hi> the <hi>Wallnut,</hi> the <hi>Acron,</hi> and <hi>Hazle-Nut,</hi> &amp;c. are Guarded with ſuch Prickles, Shell, and Rind.</p>
                     <p>When, I ſay, I conſider this Conſtant and Regular Courſe of Nature in each of theſe <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and wou'd explain all this by an infinite number of <hi>Pores</hi> of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Figures, I muſt own my ſelf quite loſt in the Contemplation, being not able to Solve any of that vaſt Crowd of Difficulties, which at the very firſt preſenting themſelves to my Curioſity, Diſorder and Confound my Thoughts.—I cannot know, for Inſtance,</p>
                     <p>How, by what, where, and when are all thoſe <hi>Pores</hi> made? For 'tis evident, they did not come all ready made out of the Earth, nor were they Incloſed in the ſubſtance of that Water which the <hi>Roots</hi> make uſe of in making the <hi>Sap.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whether they are all made at once, and ſeparated afterwards, or whether the firſt have a Power of making others as occaſion ſhall require? For if ſo, they muſt be ſuppoſed to produce one another in infinite Succeſſions.</p>
                     <p>And admitting this, how ſhall I certainly know the Original, and the place of this firſt <hi>Pore,</hi> which upon its paſſing out of this ſmall Stalk, is either to produce, or to find in its paſſage, ſuch a vaſt number of others as ſhall be exactly fit to qualify the <hi>Sap</hi> for thoſe ſeveral Uſes, of <hi>Bark, Subſtance, Seed, Smell,</hi> and all the other Parts and Qualities of the Fruit they are to make.</p>
                     <p>Whether this ſmall Stalk be really the Womb where all thoſe <hi>Pores</hi> are formed, or whether it is any more than a Chanel through which they only paſs, without leaving any of their number behind, when they go to make ſuch fair, uſeful, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcented Fruits.</p>
                     <p>How this Number of <hi>Pores</hi> ſo range themſelves in the Stalks of Fruits, as to make them always exactly of ſuch a determinate length; In Leaves, ſo as to make that half Leaf <hi>en caur</hi> which we find before the great Leaf in <hi>Orange-Trees:</hi> In the <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Almond,</hi> to preſerve the reſpective bigneſs of their Shells: In <hi>Plants,</hi> to obſerve the ſame diſtances between the knots whereby they are at certain lengths, diſtinguiſhed, as in the <hi>Roſe-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Sureau,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Corn;</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all this with ſo much exactneſs and proportion.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore when in the Months of <hi>January</hi> or <hi>February,</hi> Thirty <hi>Melon-Seeds,</hi> for Example, being ſet in the ſame Bed, are ſo far from Sprouting or Growing up all together, that there is ſometimes Three or Four, or Five or Six Months ſpace, between the firſt and the laſt.</p>
                     <p>I wou'd gladly have thoſe that will needs have <hi>Vegetation</hi> performed by a forcible bringing in of certain little Particles of Earth into the <hi>Plant,</hi> Reſolve me in theſe Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Whether Particles thus brought in, have <hi>Pores</hi> or not? If they have, then we ſhall have <hi>Pores</hi> brought one into another; And then pray conſider, whither ſuch a Notion as this will lead us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whether the <hi>Pores</hi> are all firſt Form'd before the <hi>Seed</hi> is Set, or whether they are afterwards made by the Heat of the Bed? They cannot ſay it is done the latter way; and if the former, I Demand further,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Whether thoſe <hi>Pores</hi> are always open and ready to receive, or they are open'd by the Heat of the Bed?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Suppoſing thoſe <hi>Pores</hi> always open, I wou'd know whether they have any thing within, or Nothing?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Upon this Suppoſal that they are all open, I ask further, Why thoſe in one Seed do not as well, and as ſoon draw in theſe Earthly Particles as thoſe of another?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Granting this Introduction of ſmall Particles of Earth, How comes it to paſs that thoſe Particles, which in all things elſe appear plainly to go upward, enter into the Seed for no other end, but only that they may immediately paſs out again downwards, that ſo they may be turn'd into <hi>Roots?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48210:256"/>
Seventhly, I Demand whether new <hi>Pores</hi> are Formed in the <hi>Root,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced Particles come in only through thoſe new <hi>Pores,</hi> or whether they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to come in only through thoſe of the Seed, through which they firſt enter'd in to make their <hi>Roots?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would alſo further know, Whether one ſort of <hi>Wood</hi> be more <hi>Porous</hi> than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I own that ſome have larger <hi>Pores</hi> than others, as the <hi>Liege,</hi> for Example, than the <hi>Ebene:</hi> But I cannot conceive how one ſhould have more than another, ſince all are made up of little Parts which come together ſucceſſively one after another.</p>
                     <p>Now if all <hi>Roots</hi> be equally <hi>Porous,</hi> how comes it that ſome Act more vigorouſly than others? The <hi>Vine,</hi> for Inſtance, and the <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> make abundantly more <hi>Roots</hi> than any other Trees.</p>
                     <p>Is it not reaſonable to aſcribe theſe Effects to a certain Principle of Action which exerts it ſelf more vigorouſly in thoſe than in any other <hi>Vegetables,</hi> juſt as we ſee more of vigour and ſprightlineſs in one Man than in another; and in one fort of Brutes than in ſome of another Kind?</p>
                     <p>I would alſo fain know, whence it happens, as we ſee it often does, that certain Trees newly Planted remain a long time in the Earth, ſome two or three Months; nay as many Years, without any the leaſt appearance of Action: As alſo how ſome Seeds continue whole Years without Sprouting?</p>
                     <p>This queſtionleſs muſt be acknowledged a matter of great Difficulty, and very Obſcure. In ſhort therefore, I will take it for granted, that there is more in the effecting of all this, than a meer meeting together of certain great or little <hi>Pores</hi> of different Figures. That we muſt look higher for the Original of that <hi>Vegetative</hi> Faculty, and own that Principle of Life to be neither a Free nor a Caſual, but a Neceſſary Agent; concerning which I ſhall ſpeak more at large <hi>hereafter,</hi> which by means of an External Heat, and a due Proportion of Moiſture, is <hi>determined</hi> to Form thoſe ſeveral Particles of Matter, ſome into Skin, others into Pulp, others into Juice, ſome to give the Fruit its Reliſh, and others its Smell; ſome to become Seeds, others Stalks of the Fruits, and others the Wood of the Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is this alſo that, by means of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which it Prepares in the <hi>Roots,</hi> makes the Trees capable of receiving an infinite variety of Alterations, juſt as the Moiſture of the Earth makes it capable of Producing, or rather indeed of being Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Production of ſo many ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Plants,</hi> all different one from another.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Living</hi> Stock of each Tree is, in effect, the ſame to <hi>Graffs</hi> that the Earth is to <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Plants;</hi> and in ſome ſort the ſame that the Air is to the Different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick, or Water to the Inſtruments of Water-works: That is, the <hi>Sap</hi> in each of thoſe Stocks is equally diſpos'd to produce this or that Effect; and conſequently is capable of great Alterations, according to the difference of the <hi>Graffs</hi> which are ſet upon the <hi>Stock;</hi> between which and them, there muſt however be ſome ſort of Natural Agreement.—Though after all, the farther I purſue this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, the greater Difficulties I find my ſelf Entangled in, and the leſs able I am to ſatisfy my own Curioſity.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould very willingly Embrace this New Opinion, if it could not ſhew me all the ſeveral Figures of thoſe Wonderful <hi>Pores,</hi> but only Teach me, how, upon occaſion, to direct Nature to make ſuch <hi>Pores</hi> as were for my Purpoſe, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Making of ſuch as were not. But now that there is no great likelihood that this Philoſophy will ever procure us ſuch an Advantage, ſince none has yet been able to attain to it, and that notwithſtanding all that is, or can be ſaid, we muſt have Recourſe to Divine Providence, and Aſſert that if what thoſe Gentlemen Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance be true, that every particular Kind of Fruit is of ſuch, or ſuch a Taſt, Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Shape, meerly becauſe its <hi>Pores</hi> are of ſuch or ſuch a Figure: (I ſay we muſt Aſſert) that 'tis the Divine Providence alone that has Ordained, that <hi>Pores</hi> of ſuch or ſuch a Figure ſhall certainly make ſuch or ſuch a ſort of Fruit. <hi>And then Pray, what New Diſcoveries has this Philoſophy made towards finding out of the Nature of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Beings? And did not the Old Hypotheſis go altogether as far in ſearching out the firſt Workings of Providence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if in favour of this Opinion it be urged, That one day <hi>Lunetts</hi> and <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes</hi> may poſſibly be invented, whereby theſe <hi>Pores</hi> may plainly be ſeen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, and that there wants only Time and Induſtry to bring all this to paſs, may it not alſo, with as good Reaſon be hoped, That the ſame Inſtruments may ſerve to Diſcover the Attractive Motion of the <hi>Roots,</hi> againſt which thoſe Gentlemen ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48210:257"/>
eagerly contend? Though to ſpeak my Mind freely, I cannot underſtand what a Company of <hi>Pores</hi> is able to effect; how each ſhould be joyn'd to its Fellow, ſo at leaſt as to make up any thing that is not it ſelf a <hi>Pore;</hi> what their ſides are made of, and what they are joyn'd together with. I am indeed of Opinion, that in every one of the Works of Nature there are a great many of theſe <hi>Pores;</hi> as alſo, tht they are much bigger in ſome Bodies than in others. But ſince <hi>Pores</hi> can be nothing elſe but little Bodies, that is, Figured Cells, having no ſolid Matter within, and compaſs'd about with their own ſides, thoſe ſides muſt of neceſſity be ſolid; and alſo be joyn'd together by ſomething elſe of a Nature different from their own. And this will engage us in ſuch deep Speculations, as are not leſs difficult than the Ideas of Accidents and Occult Qualities; which I think is as much as needs be ſaid, for 'tis no more poſſible that a Concourſe of many <hi>Pores</hi> ſhould make up a ſolid Body, without being determined by ſome other thing that is ſolid, than that in Arithmetic a Line of Ciphers ſhould make up an Effective Number, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the Head of it ſome one of thoſe Nine Principal Characters, which Cuſtom and Common Conſent has Veſted with a Power of Determining what each of thoſe Ciphers ſhall ſtand for in Numeration.</p>
                     <p>Their Notion, who hold that all theſe Changes can be Aſcrib'd to nothing elſe but ſuch different Qualities as the Great Author of Nature has thought good to fix in the ſeveral kinds of Bodies, is more eaſily conceiv'd, and better underſtood, by my weak and ſhallow Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Though after all, I do not pretend Magiſterially to Determine, whither of the two Opinions has the more of Certainty and Reaſon on its ſide, my Buſineſs being only to preſent to the World thoſe Thoughts which my Study, and the Remarks I have made upon <hi>Vegetation,</hi> have ſuggeſted to me. And in this Particular I ſhall uſe the ſame Diligence I have done in the reſt of the Book.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, I have upon Occaſion conſider'd ſeveral other Parts of the Works of Nature, and obſerv'd how the Heads of ſome ſorts of Birds are Adorned with Tufts and Combs, whilſt others are Diſtinguiſh'd either by the Feathers, or the Make of their Bodies.</p>
                     <p>And I have alſo often Admired the Melodious and Charming Notes of the Nightingale and Canary-Bird, while thoſe of the Magpy, the Jay, and the Crow, are ſo harſh and ungrateful. And how wonderfully ſatisfied am I in my ſelf, when conſidering theſe, and an infinite Number of other Particulars, I Reſolve all meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Good Pleaſure of the Great Author of Nature, which Ordain'd all theſe pretty Marks of Diſtinction that make up that Wonderful Harmony and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Great Machine, the World, without ever Troubling my ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how poſſibly, by the help of this Doctrine of <hi>Pores,</hi> all this might be well, and convincingly Accounted for.</p>
                     <p>So that Referring all this Variety we ſee in <hi>Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Seeds,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Providence of God, I ſhall only add, That ſo Wonderful has been the Contrivance of the Great Creator in every, the ſmalleſt piece of his Work-manſhip, as well as in thoſe great ones, the Heavens and the Earth, as ſhews his Wiſdom and his Power to be equally Infinite.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT to Return to the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and to ſee what Uſeful Inſtructions may be drawn thence for the Advancement of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> let us ſomething more cloſely conſider, whether the <hi>Roots</hi> have really any Attractive Faculty, whereby they, as the <hi>Mdſaraic Veins</hi> in the Body of an Animal, do, at their Extremities, Draw to them, and Suck in the Impregnated Moiſture of the Earth, or whether like the Cover of a Pot, they only by means of their <hi>Pores,</hi> receive the Vapours and Exhalations which are continually aſcending out of the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48210:257"/>
Each of theſe Opinions has its Patrons and Friends; and indeed, both ſeem to be Supported by good and plauſible Reaſons. But my preſent Buſineſs being only to offer my own Obſervations upon <hi>Husbandry,</hi> I ſhall be as Reſerv'd in giving my Judgment in this, as I have been in that other Caſe of <hi>Pores,</hi> and declare Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, That I am not able poſitively, to Determine in Favor either of the one, or the other.</p>
                     <p>And yet how Difficult ſoever it may be to Explain, or even to Conceive a clear Idea of what we call <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> in Sublunary Bodies, I cannot but own my Inclination to Approve rather of Living and Attractive Powers, than an Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Lifeleſs Row and Order of <hi>Parts of Matter.</hi> And indeed it ſeems to me very Reaſonable, to Aſſign Action to that alone which has need of it, namely, to <hi>Plants,</hi> to the end they may Attract, and Suck in ſuch Nouriſhment, as may be Neceſſary both to Preſerve and Enlarge themſelves, and to Multiply their Species. And thence I conclude, that 'tis they that Act.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt the Earth would not grow Lank, Meagre, and Hungry, as it does, if the <hi>Plants</hi> did not Suck it juſt as Animals do their Dams; and as they do not tarry till the Milk comes to find out them, ſo neither do the <hi>Plants</hi> expect till the Vapours and Exhalations come and preſent themſelves to the <hi>Pores.</hi> This Moiſtureriſes up continually out of the Bowels of all ſorts of Earth, though thoſe Earths do not thereby ceaſe to be ſtill Freſh; that is, in a Condition to produce all ſorts of Fruits. And ſince it is utterly falſe that the Goodneſs of any Rich Soil Decays, or is in the leaſt Diminiſhed by being not made uſe of in Feeding ſome ſet <hi>Plants,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, That when ſuch an Earth fails of its uſual Fruitfulneſs, as it ſometimes does, even to perfect Barrenneſs, this Decay muſt proceed from the Activity of the <hi>Roots,</hi> which by their Attractive Motion have Exhauſted all that Fruitful Salt which Nature had furniſhed it with. And if we obſerve how the <hi>Roots</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> ſet in a Cheſt of Earth, get out in great Numbers, at ſuch Holes or Crevices of the Cheſt as are neareſt the Ground, that they may there Grow and Multiply, I know not whether we may not, with very good Reaſon, allow them a kind of Local Motion.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, it is for Reaſons that Incline me to Favour this Opinion of an Attractive Power in the <hi>Roots,</hi> that I do leave but a very few <hi>Roots</hi> upon the Trees I Plant; for if I imagined that the <hi>Sap,</hi> which the Tree requires in great Abundance, did without any Action in the <hi>Vegetable,</hi> barely enter into the <hi>Roots</hi> through ſuch Holes, or <hi>Pores,</hi> as it found open, I ſhou'd certainly believe that the more old <hi>Roots</hi> I left on, the more <hi>Pores</hi> or Holes to receive the <hi>Sap</hi> I ſhou'd alſo leave, and that it wou'd aſcend in greater quantities into the Bodies of ſuch Trees, than of thoſe that had fewer <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my own Experience ſhews me that all this is falſe, and that a good Tree, of what ſort ſoever, being Planted in a good Earth, with a few <hi>Roots,</hi> and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhort, Grows much better and quicker than another equally Good, and Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time in as Rich an Earth with many long <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this Caſe I think I may ſafely rely upon my own Experience, ſince I herein advance nothing but upon above Thirty Years Tryal and Careful Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And upon the whole, I lay down this as a ſtanding Rule, That the more old <hi>Roots</hi> you leave upon the Tree you Plant, the fewer and the worſe the New ones will be which it ſends forth; whereas the fewer you leave, provided they be good ones, and indifferently ſhort, the more and the better the New ones will be. And to this I chiefly Aſcribe the different Succeſs we uſually obſerve in Planting.</p>

                        <p>Conſiderations upon the Vital Principle in <hi>Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Lay down this as another Maxim which I think never fails, and which, having already ſpoken ſomething of it, I come now more fully to Enlarge upon; Namely, That there is in every <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Plant</hi> a certain Principle of Life, which being Aſſiſted with all the neceſſary Circumſtances of a good Earth, due Moiſture, a favourable Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes every part of the <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>Plant</hi> ſo to Act, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all its Offices, that they all continue in their Natural Vigour, ſo long as this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48210:258"/>
Vital Principle is not injured; and that as ſoon as it is deſtroyed, the <hi>Plant</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Dies.</p>
                     <p>But this Vital Principle is not in all <hi>Plants</hi> lodged in one and the ſame place; for in ſome 'tis lodged in that outward Eye of the <hi>Plant,</hi> which is the firſt that appears above Ground, and diſtinguiſhes it from other <hi>Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Melons, Turnips,</hi> and all ſorts of <hi>Annual Flowers;</hi> and this being cut off, all the reſt of the <hi>Plant</hi> immediately dies, and that without recovery.</p>
                     <p>In others 'tis ſeated in the Ball of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Tulips, Jacintes, Imperiales, Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, &amp;c.</hi> And theſe <hi>Plants</hi> do not die, but when their round <hi>Root</hi> is ſpoiled by Heat, or Cold, or Wet, or by being cut or bruiſed; nor will the taking away the fore-mentioned Eye do them any great hurt.</p>
                     <p>In others, beſides its principal Seat, which I ſhall ſpeak of by and by, when I come to Treat of <hi>Great Trees,</hi> 'tis diffuſed like a kind of Seed through all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Parts, as is evident in the Branches of <hi>Vines, Fig-Trees, Quince-Trees, Salows, Ivy, Giroſtees, Jaunes,</hi> and in general of all ſorts that eaſily admit of either Engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing or Inoculation.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In others, as in all <hi>Trees,</hi> both thoſe that do, and ſuch as do not bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> this <hi>Vital Principle</hi> ſeems to be between the <hi>Bole</hi> and the <hi>Roots;</hi> for the Upper Parts may be cut off, and the <hi>Roots</hi> taken away, provided nothing be done to the very place where it is lodged, and yet the <hi>Tree</hi> be ſo far from being prejudiced thereby, that on the contrary this will make it ſend forth both more <hi>Branches,</hi> and more <hi>Roots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that which gave me the greateſt Light in judging of the Seat of this <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> was the Obſervations I made upon the Sprouting either of <hi>Almonds,</hi> or <hi>Peach-Stones,</hi> or the Seeds of <hi>Melons, Lettuces,</hi> or any other ſort of <hi>Pot-herbs;</hi> that when they come once to be throughly moiſten'd, and heated in the Earth, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of each ſwelling ſo, as not to be any longer contained within their reſpective <hi>Shells</hi> or <hi>Skins,</hi> it makes it ſelf a paſſage out at the ſharpeſt part of the <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> howſoever it happen'd to lie in the Ground; and thence iſſues out firſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a <hi>Root,</hi> white, and proportionable to the <hi>Nut,</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> out of which is ſprouts. This, directing its courſe downwards, grows longer and thicker, and ſends forth other ſmall <hi>Roots</hi> all along on every ſide of it. And all this it does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing appears to aſcend upwards to the ſurface of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>But at length when the <hi>Root</hi> has ſo fixed and ſtrengthen'd it ſelf, as to be able to ſupport and nouriſh the <hi>Plant,</hi> whereof it is to be the Foundation, then at the very ſame place where it ſprung out, the <hi>Nut</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> perfectly opens it ſelf, to give a paſſage to the Stem, which begins its Formation exactly in the ſame place with the Root; and by degrees it works it ſelf through all the Earth that lies upon it, and at laſt appears above Ground in a few ſmall Leaves, which ſhew both the Top of the <hi>Plant,</hi> and of what kind it is, and ſo grows up to its natural bigneſs.</p>
                     <p>I hold then, that there is in <hi>Plants</hi> a certain Principle of Life, and that is the very ſame that Philoſophers call <hi>The Vegetative Soul;</hi> and that 'tis a neceſſary Agent which at certain times cannot but act, and that too ſometimes after ſuch a manner as Men ſhall direct.</p>
                     <p>But to make it do ſo, care muſt be taken, that That part of the <hi>Plant</hi> where this Vital Principle is chiefly lodged, be perfectly ſound; that the Principle it ſelf be moved and actuated by a juſt degree of Heat; and laſtly, that if the <hi>Plant</hi> have Roots, they be found, and ſet in a good Earth, duly moiſten'd. But for the better clearing of this Particular, it may be neceſſary to obſerve theſe four Things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That that part of the <hi>Plant</hi> where the Vital Principle is ſeated be ſound, and in good condition: For if it be in the leaſt Putrified or Corroded, or have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any thing from Cold, Drought, or any other Accident, it will receive no benefit from that Heat which <hi>Plants</hi> require, but will at beſt Thrive but very ill, and perhaps quite die away.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it be Cheriſhed with a due and a proportionable degree of Heat, both in the the Earth, and in the Air; For ſome Plants are ſoon Heated, and put into Action, as all <hi>Spring-Flowers</hi> in General, the <hi>Indian Cheſnut,</hi> the <hi>Raſpis,</hi> the <hi>Sparagus,</hi> and moſt Kitchin-Herbs, and particularly the <hi>Oignons de Coronne Imperiale,</hi> the <hi>Tulip,</hi> and ſome others; ſome of which ſhoot out their Roots, and others their Stem, without being ſet in the Ground; and that too when the Power of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to be as it were aſleep, namely in the month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And others again are of a colder Complexion, and harder to be moved; ſuch as the <hi>Mulberry, Yew-ſeeds, Sweet Charvil, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore 'tis no wonder if
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48210:258"/>
all <hi>Plants</hi> do not enter upon Action at one and the ſame time, tho' the Heat both of the Earth, and of the Air, be the ſame to all, and upon that Conſideration might be ſuppoſed to Influence all alike. So that it is evident, that 'tis the different Nature of the <hi>Plants</hi> that makes them quicker or ſlower in entring upon a ſtate of Action.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Action of the <hi>Vital Principle</hi> is limited and confined to certain ſpaces of Time, which in ſome <hi>Plants</hi> are much longer than in others; as in all larger <hi>Trees,</hi> and eſpecially in thoſe we commonly call for diſtinction-ſake <hi>Green-Trees,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Yew,</hi> the <hi>Eſpicias,</hi> the <hi>Holly, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo in the <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> In moſt of which <hi>Trees,</hi> it ſcarcely ever gives over Acting either in Summer or Winter, provided none of thoſe four Qualifications be wanting. In other <hi>Plants</hi> this Seaſon of Action is much ſhorter, and can by no means be prolonged beyond that time Nature has aſſigned it, as in <hi>Lettices, Peaſe, Tulips, Anemonies, Hyacinths, &amp;c.</hi> all which have but a very ſhort time of Action, and appear in a manner quite dead within a very few months after they firſt began to give any certain ſigns of Life.</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing I am to obſerve is, That the <hi>Roots</hi> muſt not only be ſound, but alſo ſet in a good Earth duly moiſten'd: For if the <hi>Roots</hi> be Damaged, either by drought, or any other way; or if being Sound, they happen to be ſet in an Earth that is either bad, or exhauſted; or laſtly, if being good, it want due moiſture: In any of theſe caſes, you will not be ſenſible of any manner of Action the <hi>Plant</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms.</p>
                     <p>And this is a Truth which every body knows, ſo that I need not Enlarge upon it. We ſee daily Inſtances of it, eſpecially in the Spring, in <hi>Trees</hi> both kept in Cheſts, and newly Set. For if either of theſe want moiſture, without which they cannot Act, and conſequently grow too Hot, and Dry, they immediately ſeem as it were Faint, and in a dying Condition; but no ſooner are they wet either with a Shower, or by the Gardiner's Hand, then you immediately obſerve in them juſt ſuch another Change as is made the ſame way in Perſons recovered out of a Swoon.</p>
                     <p>For as in this latter Caſe, Perſons in a Swoon recover themſelves by receiving a little Wine, or Spirits; which Recovery is perform'd by the Nutritive Faculty, which coming to Act upon this new Supply of Nouriſhment, makes uſe of it as a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and diſpenſes it out of the Stomach, where it received it, to all the Parts of the Body: Juſt ſo when the <hi>Tree,</hi> which either in a Cheſt, or newly Set, had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for want of Water, comes to be Refreſhed by a new Supply of Water, its <hi>Roots,</hi> and eſpecially the extreme Parts of them, being throughly moiſten'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, immediately the Vital Principle begins to act again upon the moiſten'd Earth, and ſends up a great quantity of Sap, which diſtributing it ſelf into all the ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> its <hi>Boughs, Leaves, Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> puts them all into the very ſame condition they were in before, when for want of moiſture the <hi>Roots</hi> gave over Acting.</p>
                     <p>And this it does, provided this Ceſſation of Action be not too long, which if it be, 'twill kill the <hi>Plant;</hi> the Vital Principle being not able to preſerve it ſelf, if it have not always ſomething of moiſture to work upon, (which moiſture it can have no way, but by the Action of the <hi>Roots;)</hi> juſt as continual Evacuation, and long Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, prove mortal to Animals, which cannot live any conſiderable time without freſh Supplies of Food.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis likewiſe to be obſerved, That <hi>Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> which are all tender, and ſhort-lived, have much more need of conſtant Supplies of Sap to keep them alive, and to preſerve their Beauty, then the Stocks, or other Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which being more ſolid and maſſive, will live a long time, though the Roots ſhould perform no Action that might any way advantage them.</p>
                     <p>We are further to note, That though the greateſt part of the Sap, that is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Roots,</hi> goes up into the upper Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> yet it does not equally at all times make them grow longer; ſometimes it does only, and that too ſo as we cannot perceive it, ſtrengthen its Parts, and enable it to ſend forth fairer <hi>Sie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s;</hi> whereas when the Sap goes up in a greater abundance, it makes it ſhoot out in Length, as we often ſee it does in a double Quantity, at both the <hi>Solſtices,</hi> and at the <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the laſt place I hold, That the Vital Principle being duly moved, and quicken'd, ſerves as an Inſtrument to Enliven, to Strengthen, and to Envigorate the <hi>Roots:</hi> So that the Strength or Weakneſs of their Action, depends wholly upon the Strength or Weakneſs of the Motion or Impreſſion they derive from this Principle;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48210:259"/>
as alſo, That the Vigour and Activity of this Principle being not Infinite, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the Nature of the <hi>Tree</hi> which it is to Enliven, it communicates it ſelf to all the <hi>Roots</hi> that depend upon it, and which it is to Actuate, according to their ſeveral Capacities, as being Inſtruments it muſt neceſſarily make uſe of in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of its Office.</p>

                        <p>Conſiderations upon the Number of <hi>Roots</hi> to be left in the Planting of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom what has been ſaid, it evidently follows, that the more Numerous thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> are which depend upon that Principle, ſo much a leſſer ſhare of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Motion and Impreſſion does accrue to each of them in particular.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis moſt certain, that when only three or four <hi>Roots</hi> receive the whole Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a certain proportion of Vigor as might have been diſtributed to a greater Number; each, I ſay, of thoſe three or four being thereby more plentifully ſupplied, doth conſequently become capable of producing more, than if that Impreſſion had been divided amongſt a dozen.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo as certain, that ſince this Impreſſion can never lie uſeleſs in that part where it is received; it muſt neceſſarily act in proportion to what it is in it ſelf, that is either ſtrongly or weakly, according to its own Strength or Weakneſs. Now ſince the effect of this Impreſſion upon the <hi>Root</hi> is nothing but the Production of other <hi>Roots;</hi> if the Impreſſion it ſelf be weak and feeble, ſuch alſo by conſequence muſt the <hi>Roots</hi> be that are produced by it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis upon this Impreſſion that the Goodneſs and Vigour of theſe <hi>Roots,</hi> and the continuance of the whole <hi>Tree</hi> in its Beauty, do entirely depend: So that when the <hi>Roots</hi> ſucceed well, and exert themſelves ſtrongly, the <hi>Tree</hi> cannot fail of thriving both in its Trunk and Branches; as, on the contrary, if the <hi>Roots</hi> do not take well, the <hi>Tree</hi> will of neceſſity grow but very poorly.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: Since every one that Plants in a good Soil, propoſes to himſelf the Raiſing a <hi>Tree</hi> as ſoon as may be, that ſhall be Vigorous, and capable of being long Liv'd. He muſt take ſpecial Care ſo to order it in the Setting, as to make it in a little time put forth ſome of thoſe good new <hi>Roots,</hi> ſince it is from them only that he can expect the Accompliſhment of his Deſires.</p>
                     <p>Now for the better attaining of this, it is to be conſidered, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That although there are few <hi>Trees</hi> Planted, but what have ſome of theſe <hi>Roots;</hi> yet they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Advantage from them, whatever their Number be, if thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> ſoon after they are Planted do not produce new ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> You muſt take notice, that it is from theſe thick and ſtrong new-grown <hi>Roots,</hi> that <hi>Trees</hi> become fair, great, thick Leav'd, and firmly Rooted in the Ground; whereas thoſe new <hi>Roots</hi> which are ſmall and feeble, act but very weakly, and always diſcover the Symptoms of their Infirmity, either in the Leaves or Branches of the Trees belonging to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe thick and hard new <hi>Roots</hi> ſhoot forth only from two Places, <hi>viz.</hi> Either from the very Body of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which rarely happens; or elſe, as is moſt uſual, from ſome other thick and ſtrong old <hi>Roots:</hi> For, as I have obſerved before, ſuch <hi>Roots</hi> as are ſmall and feeble, can only produce others as feeble as themſelves, and therefore not likely to turn to any account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You muſt obſerve, that even of thoſe old, thick, and hard <hi>Roots,</hi> from which only you are to expect ſuch new ones to ſhoot out as you deſire, ſome are much better than others. The beſt, and principally to be choſen, are thoſe of the lateſt Growth out of the foot of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and they are eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their ſmooth and reddiſh Skin from thoſe that are older, which always look black, rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and full of wrinkles; whereby you will preſently diſcover them to be unfit for uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This ſort of good <hi>Roots</hi> cannot be produced, but by virtue of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion proceeding from the Vital Principle of the <hi>Tree;</hi> and this Impreſſion will be ſo much the more ſtrong and active, the fewer you leave of thoſe old <hi>Roots</hi> amongſt which it is to be divided.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve likewiſe, that this Impreſſion will be the more effectual, the nearer it is made to the Principle from which it proceeds. But this Nearneſs is not to be ſtrictly and abſolutely underſtood, but with ſuch a Reſtriction, as when we ſay, A good Eye can better diſtinguiſh Objects which are near, than thoſe which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48210:259"/>
are remote; ſince it is well obſerved by the Philoſophers, That all Extremes are to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> 'Tis to be obſerved, that theſe good new <hi>Roots</hi> by which the <hi>Trees</hi> are ſtrongly faſten'd in the Ground, and plentifully nouriſhed, generally ſhoot forth at the ends of the old <hi>Roots;</hi> provided they are not left of too great a Length, or planted above a Foot deep.</p>
                     <p>For you will find, that of theſe new <hi>Roots</hi> of the later Shoot, thoſe which grow at a greater diſtance from the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> are generally more lively, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of greater Virtue, than thoſe that grow nearer to it; which are always obſerved to be ſomewhat ſmaller than the others.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince the Extremities of the old <hi>Roots</hi> muſt not be too far diſtant from the <hi>Trunk,</hi> becauſe then the <hi>Tree</hi> will not be able to reſiſt the force of the Wind: It will be neceſſary to cut all of them in general ſomewhat ſhorter, as their Strength or Weakneſs will permit; that is, the weaker <hi>Roots</hi> may have more cut from them, but the ſtronger may admit of a greater length. Taking this as a General Rule: That the <hi>Roots</hi> of the ſtrongeſt and largeſt <hi>Trees</hi> ought not to be left above 9 or 12 Inches long; but for the weaker, it will be enough to leave ſome of them 2, and to others 5 or 6 Inches at moſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things being premiſed, our <hi>Gardiner</hi> muſt remember, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That to make a <hi>Tree</hi> which is planted in a good Soil thrive well, he muſt retain thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> only which appear Promiſing, Young, and of a ſufficient Bigneſs; and conſequently cut off all the Rags, and ſuch as we call <hi>Hairy Roots;</hi> as likewiſe all that through Age are worn out, rotten, or abandon'd by the Sap, which abandoning you may eaſily diſcover by this Sign, namely, When ſome younger, larger, and fairer <hi>Roots</hi> ſhoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> out above the old ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It muſt be allowed, (which yet, as I have already hinted, is not to be ſtrictly and literally underſtood,) that how ſmall ſoever the Number of <hi>Roots</hi> is which you retain, it will be ſufficient for receiving the whole Virtue of the <hi>Tree</hi>'s Vital Principle, and ſo become capable of producing ſuch new <hi>Roots</hi> as may be good and ſerviceable, ſo that oftentimes he muſt be contented with one ſingle <hi>Root,</hi> if all the reſt do not prove good; ſometimes he may keep 2 or 3, or 4 or 5 at moſt, all of them ſeparated at a due diſtance from each other: Theſe altogether make up what we call a <hi>Bed</hi> or <hi>Lay of Roots,</hi> and when they happen to be ſo many, muſt, in the Planting your <hi>Tree</hi> about a Foot deep, be diſpoſed ſo far below the Surface of the Ground, as may ſecure them from being killed either by Heat, Cold, or the Stroke of a Spade, (and for this, 8 or 9 Inches will be enough) but yet not ſo deep as to hinder them from enjoying of the comfortable warmth of the Sun, or ſo much of the Earth's moiſture as is neceſſary for their Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let him reſt fully aſſured, that if a young <hi>Tree</hi> thus planted, with a few, and thoſe but ſhort <hi>Roots</hi> left upon it, do not thrive in the two firſt Years; it would certainly have ſucceeded no better, though he had left it more <hi>Roots,</hi> and of greater length. So that without loſing any more time in a fruitleſs Expectation, to which all <hi>Gardiners</hi> are extremely ſubject, let him reſolve with all convenient ſpeed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Directions here preſcribed, to Plant another good <hi>Tree</hi> in the room of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have given you the <hi>Rules</hi> for Planting, which I had propoſed to my ſelf, with relation both to the <hi>Tree</hi> and the <hi>Soil;</hi> by the Obſervation of which, the <hi>Tree</hi> will put forth good new <hi>Roots,</hi> whereby that Nouriſhment is conveyed to it which cauſes it to thrive as well in the Body as Branches, and makes it continue vigorous, and every Year to bring forth plentifully both Leaves and Fruit.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR the better Illuſtration how that Nouriſhment, which in the Spring begins to enter into each <hi>Root,</hi> is at the ſame inſtant of time diſtributed into the Trunk, Branches, Leaves, and Fruit of the <hi>Tree.</hi> I cannot think of any fitter or more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Compariſon than that of a Torch, which, as ſoon as it is lighted in the midſt of a dark Room, does in a moment, and at once, diffuſe its Light in its whole Circumference, in every place of the Room wherever it can reach.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Sap</hi> being a Liquid, Light, and Subtil Body, which, as well as all Vapours and Exhalations, ſeems to participate of the Nature of Air, and conſequently to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48210:260"/>
have its Centre in the upper, rather than in the lower Parts: The Reſemblance in the ſubtility of their matter, which ſeems to be found between <hi>Sap</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> will, I hope, make my Compariſon allowable.</p>
                     <p>But how far ſoever it may hold in ſome Reſpects, yet I am very ſenſible there is a conſiderable difference in others. For as <hi>Light</hi> diffuſes its ſtrongeſt emiſſions upon thoſe parts of the Air that are neareſt to the Luminous Body, which is their Source and Original Cauſe, ſo likewiſe it grows ſenſibly Weaker in the Remoter Parts, in proportion to their greater or leſſer diſtance from that Source. And this is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Order of Nature, which hath determined every Agent to a certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Sphere of Activity, and to Act more powerfully upon thoſe Objects that are at a Reaſonable diſtance, than upon ſuch as being further off, are in ſome manner out of its reach.</p>
                     <p>But now on the contrary, the <hi>Sap</hi> produces its moſt conſiderable Effects, in thoſe Parts which are fartheſt diſtant from the <hi>Roots,</hi> from which it is originally deriv'd. For having a Natural tendency to raiſe it ſelf, with impetuoſity to the Extremities of the <hi>Tree,</hi> which are its proper Centre; it only makes a quick and brisk Paſſage through all the other Parts, which are the Channels to convey it to that Centre.</p>
                     <p>We find then, That the Sap which is prepared by the <hi>Roots</hi> in the Ground, makes its firſt Entrance in great Plenty into theſe Extremities of the <hi>Branches;</hi> the other parts of thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> tho' nearer to the <hi>Trunk,</hi> receive no benefit from that <hi>Sap,</hi> but proportionably as they lye nearer, or farther from the <hi>Spring</hi> which produced it. The only Advantage the Lower parts of thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> can get from it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds merely from the abode which that <hi>Sap,</hi> in its continual Aſcent towards thoſe Extremities, is ſometimes forced to make in the Neighbourhood of thoſe Lower parts. This abode happens, when that which was already come up of the firſt <hi>Sap,</hi> being not able to break out ſoon enough to be employed in putting forth <hi>Branches, Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> is a hindrance to the Attempt of that which comes after it, and conſequently ſtopping it by the way; for a while makes it tarry at ſome diſtance from thoſe extremities, till the paſſage be opened for it, to iſſue out as the foregoing <hi>Sap</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>And methinks, This ſeems to have a great Reſemblance with what often happens in a Stream, that is ſtopt in its deſcent by ſome Dam. This Stream haſtening to its Centre beyond that Dam, runs continually toward it, with all the ſwiftneſs that the preſſure of its own Weight can afford it. In the mean time, all the New Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which flows every moment from the ſame Spring, from whence both of them are deriv'd, ſtriving naturally to follow the Courſe of the foregoing, which iſſued out firſt; 'tis intercepted in its paſſage by that firſt, ſo as it cannot reach even the Dam; by reaſon that the firſt having as it were ſeized upon that principal Poſt, hinders it from flowing any further, juſt in the ſame manner as the Dam hindred the flowing of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>From hence it comes to paſs, Firſt, That both being ſo ſtopt, there is a great Conflux of Water made in a certain Tract of Land. Secondly, That thoſe parts of that Water, which are moſt diſtant from the Dam, dilate themſelves on every ſide, and conſequently Wet, Nouriſh, and even Drown ſometimes the <hi>Plants</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on its <hi>Banks,</hi> which would have been neither Watered nor Nouriſhed, could that Water inſtead of meeting with the ſaid Dam, have freely arrived whither its own Declivity would have carried it.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the <hi>Sap</hi> whoſe Source is in the <hi>Roots,</hi> having a natural propenſion to Riſe up to the Extremities of the <hi>Branches,</hi> to which it tends as its own Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, is, as we have already ſaid, ſometimes ſtopt far enough from its deſigned mark, by that which aſcended firſt, and which had not time enough by iſſuing forth to compleat its intended Work.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sap</hi> which aſcended laſt, continues never ſo little in the place where it is ſtopp'd, it never fails of producing ſome New Effect, which ſhews it has been ſtopp'd there: for its abode is never uſeleſs wherever it be; and the Effects produced by it are theſe.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR the better Underſtanding this Maxim, it is to be obſerved, That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of it Relates to thoſe <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> which tho' they grow ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bigger <hi>Branches,</hi> yet it is only in the parts which are fartheſt diſtant from their Extremities, that is to ſay in the loweſt part of the <hi>Branch:</hi> The Second part of it is concerning the <hi>Buds</hi> that grow upon the Weak <hi>Branches,</hi> in a place quite contrary to that of the big ones; <hi>Viz.</hi> In the very Extremities of them.</p>
                     <p>There are then, as you have already heard, two ſorts of <hi>Branches,</hi> Strong and Weak, upon each of which theſe <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> are formed; and I think I may preſume to ſay, That the <hi>Sap</hi> which is diffuſed through the whole extent of thoſe <hi>Branches,</hi> makes there as it were a Body of <hi>Sap:</hi> I am forced to expreſs my ſelf in theſe Terms, to render my Maxim more intelligible.</p>
                     <p>There is no queſtion to be made, as I have before intimated, but that a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportion of that <hi>Sap</hi> riſes up to the Extremity of all ſorts of <hi>Branches,</hi> than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it in any other parts.</p>
                     <p>Now I give the Name of <hi>Strong,</hi> as well to the whole <hi>Branch</hi> that is big and ſtrong, as to that part of all ſorts of <hi>Branches</hi> whatſoever, where the <hi>Sap</hi> is gathered in a greater quantity.</p>
                     <p>And I call <hi>Weak,</hi> as well the whole <hi>Branch</hi> whether ſmall and weak, as that part of any ſort of <hi>Branches</hi> whatſoever, which partakes of that <hi>Sap</hi> in a leſſer quantity.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppos'd, I poſitively affirm, that in the big and ſtrong <hi>Branches,</hi> where there is a greater confluence of <hi>Sap,</hi> that <hi>Sap</hi> forcing it ſelf upward to their Extremities, is conſequently convey'd thither in great Plenty. But that abundance as great as it is, may be fit to cauſe the putting forth many <hi>Branches,</hi> but is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the making of <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi> For experience tells us, that theſe are never brought forth, but in thoſe places where there is a juſt proportion of <hi>Sap, Viz.</hi> Neither too much nor too little.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis for this Reaſon probably, That we never ſee any <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> growing at the Prun'd or Lopp'd Extremity of a big <hi>Branch,</hi> except when the <hi>Sap</hi> has been diverted by ſome unknown Obſtacle, from Riſing up to it altogether, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its uſual Courſe; but upon the lower parts of the <hi>Branch,</hi> where the <hi>Sap</hi> is neither ſo plentiful nor ſo ſtirring, they are frequently produced.</p>
                     <p>And this is the Reaſon, that induced me to lay down this as a Maxim, <hi>That the</hi> Fruit-buds <hi>grow ſometimes upon the Weak of the Strong;</hi> That is to ſay <hi>upon the Weak</hi> part of the <hi>Strong Branch,</hi> where by <hi>Weak,</hi> the lower part of the <hi>Branch</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; foraſmuch, as there being really much leſs <hi>Sap</hi> in the lower, than in the upper part, or Extremity of the <hi>Branch,</hi> it has by conſequence a greater diſpoſition, to bring forth thoſe lovely <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> which ſo juſtly challenge our Admiration.</p>
                     <p>The former part of this Maxim being well underſtood, there will remain no great difficulty in the latter; ſo that when I ſay, That <hi>the</hi> Fruit-buds <hi>grow ſometimes upon the Strong of the Weak</hi> the meaning is plain, that they ſhoot out at the extremity of the <hi>weak Branches,</hi> wherein, tho' indeed there is but a ſmall quantity of <hi>Sap,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what is to be found in the big ones, yet there is more of it in the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than in any other parts of the ſame <hi>Branches,</hi> and therefore enough to make up the juſt meaſure, which is neceſſary to the Frame or Conformation of thoſe <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi> And this is the true Reaſon, why the middle ſiz'd <hi>Branches</hi> that are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too big nor too little, are commonly firſt loaded with <hi>Fruit-buds;</hi> the firſt years they begin to put out <hi>Buds</hi> at their ends, then continue from year to year to bring them forth in their whole length, but afterwards they ſhift from one part to another,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48210:261"/>
ſtill drawing back by degrees nearer to that big <hi>Branch</hi> out of which they ſprung, till at laſt they come to bear in that which is neareſt to the place from whence they had their firſt Production.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have obſerved elſewhere, in Diſcourſing of the means to prevent the ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, to which the <hi>Fruit-bearing Branches</hi> are Subject, that thoſe <hi>Branches</hi> never laſt long in any <hi>Trees:</hi> But that in <hi>Stone-Fruits,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Peaches,</hi> they never bear twice ſucceſſively in the ſame place. Commonly they die in the very year of their bearing, which is the following year after their ſhooting forth. But if any of them eſcape, the Reaſon is, that being grown a little bigger than they were, they put forth out at their Extremities, ſome other Fruitful <hi>Branches</hi> againſt the next year; but after that time they become Dry and Uſeleſs, and by conſequence muſt be cut off.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Core-Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> laſt ſomewhat longer, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> continue bearing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Length 5 or 6 years ſucceſſively, till at laſt they fall by the Common Fate of <hi>Fruit-bearing Branches,</hi> that is to periſh by their own Fruitfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is not improbable, but that the ſame thing may be ſaid, in Relation to the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe <hi>Fruit-Branches,</hi> that is generally obſerv'd in the <hi>Fruits</hi> themſelves, which decay conſtantly in a certain time; and the Reſemblance between them, is, in my Opinion, well enough Grounded, to admit the Compariſon. For as the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or mark of Corruption in <hi>Fruits,</hi> is the perfection of their Ripeneſs; that is to ſay, they are then neareſt to Corruption, when they have attained their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Maturity; ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Branches</hi> their beginning to bear, is the firſt Sign of their approaching Deſtruction; that is to ſay, according to the Common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> they begin to die, juſt in the ſame Moment, that they begin to bear <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to give ſome probable Reaſon of this particular Deſtruction; it cannot be ſaid, That the <hi>Fruit-bearing Branch</hi> deſtroys it ſelf, ſeeing it hath no peculiar Action diſtinct from the general Action of the Plant, whoſe great End is ſelf-preſervation. It is then more to the purpoſe, I conceive to ſay, that thoſe Parts <hi>(Viz.</hi> The <hi>Weak Branches)</hi> through which that ſmall quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> paſſeth, which makes the <hi>Fruit,</hi> being not ſtored with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> to ſtrengthen themſelves, and to reſiſt the injuries of the Air, do firſt begin to dry up inſenſibly, and ſoon after whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wither and Dye: Whereas the other parts which are furniſh'd with it in greater Plenty; <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Strong, Thick,</hi> and <hi>Vigorous Branches,</hi> being daily ſupplied with New <hi>Sap,</hi> and thereby Fortified againſt the Injuries of the Air, have alſo the good luck of a longer continuance.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is a Queſtion that has extreamly puzled the Curious, to explain the inward Frame of theſe <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> and I muſt confeſs, that the Contexture and Arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of thoſe little Leaves enfolded in one another, which make up thoſe <hi>Buds</hi> and diſtinguiſh them from the other parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> are an ample Subject for a very Curious but difficult diſquiſition; and I ſhould be extreamly glad to Arrive at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect underſtanding of this wonderful Maſter-piece of Nature.</p>
                     <p>But after having a great deal of pains to little purpoſe, I am forced to acquieſce and ſatisfie my Curioſity, by ſaying plainly and in the general, that thoſe <hi>Buds</hi> may probably be formed, almoſt after the ſame manner, with <hi>Cabbages</hi> and Loaf'd <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces.</hi> Let us ſee then, whether we can unfold the Myſtery of thoſe, and thereby attain to the knowledge of the other.</p>
                     <p>To find how far this Compariſon will hold, we muſt conſider, that of the ſeveral Species of Plants, there are ſome which commonly do but ſhoot forth outwardly, that is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48210:261"/>
they only lengthen and extend their Extremities. Of this ſort are ſuch as either grow upright, for Inſtance, <hi>Trees, Aſparagus, Artichokes;</hi> or ſuch as creep upon the Ground, as <hi>Melons, Gourds, Ivy,</hi> and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others there are which for a while do only ſhoot inwardly, to get a firmer and more compacted Subſtance, till at laſt they take the ſame way with the former; for Inſtance, All ſuch as are of an Orbicular Figure, as <hi>Cabbages, Loaf'd Lettuces,</hi> and even thoſe <hi>Plants</hi> which are tied together to make them grow white, as <hi>Chicorees, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe of the former kind ſhoot only at the Extremities of what was grown before; the others rarely ſhoot but only juſt round about their Center, in the ſame manner almoſt as we ſee Water ſpringing up in the ſource of a Fountain.</p>
                     <p>Having premiſed this: I ſay, That as <hi>Cabbage</hi> and <hi>Lettuces</hi> cannot grow round when their Root is too vigorous; that exceſs of Vigor cauſing them to grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in their Stem as much as their ſtrength will allow, and at laſt cauſing them to run up to Seed, when their ſtrength is much exhauſted; ſo likewiſe ſcarce any <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> can be produced on <hi>Trees</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> too much invigorated by the Sap, that exceſs of it cauſing them to exert themſelves in length inſtead of growing round, as it is neceſſary they ſhould do to become really <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A certain Mediocrity then of Vigor is requiſite in thoſe kinds of <hi>Plants,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their growing Round and Headed, as there muſt be a certain Mediocrity of Sap in <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> to produce <hi>Fruit-buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to underſtand after what manner thoſe Heads are framed in <hi>Cabbages</hi> and <hi>Lettuces,</hi> it is to be obſerved, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That thoſe outward Coats and Leaves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly firſt produced in thoſe <hi>Plants,</hi> and have their Formation begun as ſoon as the <hi>Plants</hi> themſelves. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That of all thoſe Leaves firſt produced, there uſually remain but few, which growing proportionably to the Dimenſions of the <hi>Cabbage</hi> or <hi>Lettuce,</hi> ſerve for Ramparts and Baſtions to defend the Nobler Parts lying inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and which are, as it were, the Cittadel or Magazine of the Place.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that ſome of thoſe old outward Leaves, either by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Nature, or the <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Induſtry, contracting their Extremities very cloſe to one another, do form a kind of Natural Girdle, or Cap as it were, which entirely covers and encloſes the Heart and Inſide of thoſe <hi>Plants;</hi> which being the Seat of their Vital Principle, and aſſiſted by the Action of the <hi>Roots</hi> which are produced by it, and reſembling, as we have ſaid already, the <hi>Spring</hi> of a <hi>Fountain,</hi> ſhoots continually from its whole Circumference an infinite number of ſmall Productions, which become ſo many ſmall Leaves.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe being confined, and hindred from ſpreading abroad, enfold and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelves for a while one within another, till they grow ſtrong enough to break open the Bars which reſtrain them in ſo narrow a compaſs, and violently to force their way out: And becauſe they are not expoſed to the Injuries of the Air, they remain tender, delicate, and white; as alſo being very numerous, and having but little room, they draw ſo cloſe together, that at laſt they become a hard and ſolid Body. And this is what is called <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and <hi>Loaf'd-Lettuces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is not improbable, but that <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> are formed juſt in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as thoſe <hi>Headed Cabbages.</hi> Without queſtion 'tis partly the Frame and Figure which makes the difference of their Denominations. In <hi>Trees,</hi> that ſmall, blackiſh, ſharp-topped Roundneſs which both makes, and encloſes the bloſſom, is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed <hi>Bud,</hi> than Head; as in <hi>Cabbage</hi> and <hi>Lettuce,</hi> their bigneſs and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cauſes them to be more fitly ſtyled Heads, than <hi>Buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am of opinion, That <hi>Onions</hi> are formed within the Ground almoſt after the ſame manner as the Heads of <hi>Cabbages</hi> and <hi>Lettuce</hi> are upon the ſurface of it.</p>
                     <p>Now as thoſe <hi>Onions, Cabbages,</hi> and <hi>Lettuce,</hi> when they are ſupplied with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional encreaſe of <hi>Sap,</hi> begin to diſcloſe themſelves, and to put forth that which they had a long time contained hidden within: Juſt ſo the <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> having in the Spring received an inward Encreaſe, as well by Rarefaction of their former <hi>Sap,</hi> as their new Nouriſhment, burſt out, and diſcloſe at laſt that <hi>Bloſſom</hi> which carries in it the <hi>Embrio,</hi> or firſt beginning of the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That firſt beginning of the <hi>Fruit</hi> is a very ſmall Particle, encloſed in the Heart of the <hi>Bloſſom,</hi> wherein is contained the <hi>Seed</hi> from which the <hi>Fruit</hi> is produced; nor does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them receive their Formation till the decreaſing of the Heat, and deſcent of the <hi>Sap</hi> of the foregoing Summer. The temperate Warmth of the Spring aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the <hi>Tree</hi> in bringing to perfection what was but juſt begun, at once gratifying the <hi>Gardiner</hi> with the agreeable Object of his Hopes and Deſires, and giving Nature an opportunity of multiplying its Productions.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon other Effects of the <hi>Sap</hi> relating to the Thickning and Lengthning of the Branches.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Come now to ſpeak again of thoſe Effects which owe their Being to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Sap in ſome particular Parts of the <hi>Trees,</hi> and theſe are in my Opinion evidently demonſtrated by the Inſtance of thoſe <hi>Willow-tops</hi> that grow to an extraordinary bigneſs in compariſon of their Trunk, which undoubtedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from hence, That their Top-branches being often Lopp'd off near the place of their ſhooting out, the Sap riſing up to it in its uſual courſe, cannot iſſue out ſo ſoon as it is arrived there, but is forced to tarry there for ſome time, and ſo ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and incorporating it ſelf in part to that place where it is ſtopp'd, it cauſes that Head to grow much bigger than all the reſt of thoſe Parts through which it only makes a quick Paſſage.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, and perhaps reaſonably enough, that the Sap cauſes-the bigneſs of the Branches in <hi>Trees,</hi> and the Leaves in all other <hi>Plants,</hi> almoſt in the ſame manner, as the melted Wax doth in <hi>Tapers, Flambeaux</hi> and <hi>Torches,</hi> with this difference only, (which yet doth not alter the Compariſon) That the Sap riſesup between the Wood and the Bark, aſpiring to the Center of light Bodies; whereas on the contrary, the melted Wax runs downward along the ſuſpended Wyck, becauſe it tends to the Center of heavy Bodies: And if it happens that any of that melted Wax ſtays any longer in one part than in another, it will not fail of producing the ſame Effect that the Sap doth in the Extremities of <hi>maimed Trees.</hi> I cannot find any thing in <hi>Mechanics</hi> fitter to give a lively Repreſentation, how Sap, though Liquid it ſelf, can contribute to the thickning a Solid Body by that Solidity which it ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; for it really grows thick as it were, by ſo many Coats ſucceſſively enfolded one over another, as is obvious enough to the Eye of him that doth but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the extremity of any Stump of a <hi>Tree,</hi> or that views the Structure of <hi>Onions, Radiſhes,</hi> and other Roots, when cut through the middle.</p>
                     <p>But now as to the Extenſion of the Branches of <hi>Trees,</hi> and Leaves of every <hi>Plant;</hi> (which is made in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> By the new Parts drawing nearer to the old ones, there is ſo cloſe an Union made, and, to ſpeak Philoſophically, ſuch an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and individual Incorporation, that it is impoſſible either to diſtinguiſh them by the Eye, or to unfold and ſeparate them from one another.) I ſay then, as to this Extenſion of Branches, the new Sap muſt needs have in ſome meaſure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of mollifying and melting the hard Extremity of each Branch, and Trunk, of the former Year's Growth, that ſo it may unite the new Liquid with the old Solid, and conſtitute a Body altogether like, ſo as that the leaſt difference cannot be perceived between them.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs, this is a Point that ſeems to me worthy of the higheſt Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor has the utmoſt of Humane Induſtry ever yet attained to any Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance comparable to that Imperceptible Extenſion of Branches: For though the <hi>Painters</hi> Colours laid on at ſeveral times, and the Solder which <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> make uſe of, afford us ſome ſaint Reſemblance of it; yet we muſt have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome other Effect of Nature, to give us a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of this ſo perfect an Union. For Inſtance; That of <hi>Ice,</hi> which by the ſharpneſs of the Cold is formed over all ſorts of Water, as we ſee it in the Baſin of a Fountain. 'Tis true, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of that Water which was Congeled to day, cannot abſolutely be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the inner Parts of that Water which will be Congeled to morrow, and ſo ſucceſſively from one Part to another, as the Cold continues to have a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Influence upon them: But the compariſon of <hi>Gutters</hi> in which the Icicles grow longer, proportionably as the Cold of the Air becomes more intenſe, repreſents ſtill more clearly, that lengthning of Branches which we can ſo difficultly ſolve in <hi>Trees,</hi> for to give an account how thoſe Knots and Eyes come to be ſo artificially
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48210:262"/>
placed at certain Diſtances, and to be ſo beautifully adorned with Leaves and Fruits, is beyond the Limits of our Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>But however, neither of theſe Compariſons will ſignifie much to us, unleſs there happen in the interval, from one day to another to be ſome abatement of Cold, ſo as it may certainly appear, that there has been ſome relenting of the Froſt: For when that continues without any intermiſſion, it has a like effect in the Water du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the extremity of Winter, that the Sap has in the extended Branches during the Heats of the Spring and Summer. The only difficulty lies in the firſt Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which happens at the end of the Winter; and this ariſes from the ſtirring activity in the Liquid Sap, which riſes up anew to the extremity of the hard and ſolid Branches of the preceding Year.</p>
                     <p>And here we may obſerve, That a Tree is eaſily to be cleft lengthways, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Head to the Foot, or from Foot to Head, as if in that Poſition the <hi>Fibres,</hi> of which its Trunk conſiſts, were in ſome manner like Threads wrapped cloſe one over another: But to take it breadthways or acroſs from one ſide to the other, 'tis very difficult to cleave it. For the ſeveral Parts are ſo compacted and linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that each of them ſeems to make a little All, perfect and entire in it ſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Separation be made of it, but by means of a ſharp-edg'd Tool.</p>
                     <p>What Effects are produced by the continuance of the Sap, are yet more fully demonſtrated by its contrary, namely by the too quick Paſſage of it, as it happens, (eſpecially in any ſort of <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> whether <hi>Core</hi> or <hi>Stone-Fruit)</hi> when the Sap follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its uſual Courſe, which is to aſcend by regular Steps to the extremities of the Branches, doth in its Paſſage open to it ſelf an indirect and extraordinary way into ſome other part of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and in few days puts forth what we call <hi>Suckers</hi> or <hi>Falſe Shoots.</hi> The <hi>Sap,</hi> I ſay, being thus diſordered, and making its Eſcape with ſome ſort of Violence, burſts out and riſes with an impetuous force, and during that firſt Effort, makes no ſtay in its Paſſage.</p>
                     <p>From hence it comes to paſs, that thoſe Eyes which are neareſt that breaking out are very far diſtant from one another, are flat and ill nouriſhed, ſo as to be ſcarcely diſcernible: But when the violence of that firſt Effort is ſomewhat abated, the <hi>Sap</hi> returns to its ordinary pace, and ſeems to have its regular Pauſes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it both forms thoſe Eyes nearer to each other, and affords them better Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that while the lower Parts are accounted uſeleſs and falſe Wood, the upper on the contrary prove fruitful and well condition'd.</p>
                     <p>The Reader perhaps may think, I have inſiſted too long upon this Compariſon between <hi>Sap</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> but as I could not explain my Notion more briefly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that extream quickneſs wherewith the <hi>Sap,</hi> after its being prepared by the <hi>Roots,</hi> ſeems as it were to fly to all the extremities of the Branches, ſo I wiſh that even thus I may have the good fortune to be underſtood.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall now proceed to give another Inſtance, wherein a lighted <hi>Torch</hi> and the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> have a mutual Analogy or Reſemblance, for a further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Opinion, concerning the different Operation of the <hi>Roots</hi> in relation to the <hi>Sap,</hi> which cauſes the Thickening, Lengthening, and indeed the Univerſal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For as a Luminous Body, the bigger and brighter it is, the farther will it diffuſe its Light; juſt ſo thoſe <hi>Roots</hi> that are thickeſt, hardeſt, and moſt vigorous in their Operation, do force up higheſt that <hi>Sap</hi> or Nouriſhment that is prepared by them.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is very eaſie to give a Reaſon how the Extremities of ſome <hi>Trees</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> come to die, which certainly in my Opinion is nothing elſe but only the want of ſome of thoſe ſubſtantial and ſtrong <hi>Roots</hi> growing out of the foot of the <hi>Tree;</hi> whence conſequently it happens, that there is not <hi>Sap</hi> enough prepared to riſe up ſo high as it uſed to do, either in former Years, or even in that very Seaſon wherein this Defect was obſerved.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtance: The <hi>Sap</hi> that in other Years uſed to riſe 3 or 4 Fathoms, may now perhaps riſe but 10 or 12 Feet, and of this you have a certain Indication when the new Branches ſhoot out no where but at a conſiderable diſtance below the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the old ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48210:263"/>
On the other hand, when the <hi>Sap</hi> in the beginning of the Year had advanced the Boughs 3 or 4 Feet in height, and yet towards the latter end of the Summer they begin to grow blackiſh, and at laſt to wither and die within 5 or 6 Inches of the Top; and this even when the <hi>Root</hi> ſeemed in the Spring to have ſufficiently done its part, and the <hi>Soil</hi> to have been duly qualified with ſuch a juſt proportion of Heat and Moiſture as was requiſite for their Vegetation: When this, I ſay, happens, it muſt be aſcribed to no other Cauſe than the drying up of their Moiſture by the exceſſive Heat of the Summer, in regard that their <hi>Roots</hi> being but ſmall and weak, could not ſo well reſiſt the Violence of it, as thoſe which were more vigorous and ſubſtantial. What means are proper to be uſed for the preventing of ſuch Accidents, I have already mentioned elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince the more vigorous the <hi>Root</hi> is, the more vigorouſly alſo it will act, and conſequently ſuck in more Nouriſhment, and cauſe that Nouriſhment to riſe ſo much higher, it muſt undoubtedly follow, that the riſing of the <hi>Sap</hi> to the Top of the Branches, whereby there is an Acceſſion made to their former length, proceeds only from this vigour and ſtrength of the <hi>Root;</hi> as on the other ſide, the weakneſs of the <hi>Root</hi> is the true cauſe that the <hi>Sap,</hi> not being in a ſufficient quantity to riſe to a conſiderable height, is confined much lower than its uſual pitch.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it ſeems probable, that as all Animals are limited to ſuch a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Size and Proportion, and, as a Fountain, containing ſuch a quantity of Water, and conveyed by a Pipe of ſuch a Capacity, cannot raiſe it up to a greater height than the Level of that Source from whence it flows.</p>
                     <p>In the very ſame manner the Dimenſions of all Vegetables ſeem to be confined to a certain ſtint both of height and circumference, ſo as to have a fixed Point to which the <hi>Sap</hi> may aſcend in order to the putting forth new Branches, but cannot poſſibly riſe higher to cauſe any further Production. Thus if we Lop a <hi>Tree</hi> 5 or 6 Feet, whoſe uſual height does not exceed 10 or 12, it will always appear vigorous and lively, till it have recovered its uſual height of 12 Feet; and the Reaſon is, becauſe it will be continually labouring to exert it ſelf to the utmoſt Sphere of its Activity, and conſequently there is no danger of its falling to Decay, or dying at the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of its Branches.</p>
                     <p>It muſt therefore be the <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s buſineſs to render himſelf expert in his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by a diligent Obſervation of what is neceſſary to be done, both in the Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>Trees,</hi> and the Manuring of the <hi>Ground;</hi> and indeed, the difference that is between a Fertile and Barren Soil, will aſſiſt him very much in the making a true Eſtimate of the Force and Vigour of the <hi>Sap.</hi> For in a Soil that is really good, a <hi>Tree</hi> will grow 30 or 35 Feet high, with a Circumference proportionable; but if the Soil be lank or barren, a <hi>Tree,</hi> though of the ſame Species, and as well Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd as the other, will not, perhaps, exceed 10 or 12 Feet. The former kind of Soil will prove fruitful in a manner without any Cultivation, but the latter will be good for nothing, if its Sterility be not ſupplied by the utmoſt Care and Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Gardiner.</hi>

                        <p>Reflections upon the Order of the <hi>Branches</hi> ſhooting out of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving thus given my Opinion, how the <hi>Sap,</hi> after its entrance into the <hi>Roots,</hi> does afterwards riſe up, and communicate it ſelf to the upper Parts of the <hi>Tree,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to Explain in what manner the new <hi>Branches</hi> grow out of the Extremities of thoſe of the precedent Year, and how it comes to paſs that their Shooting out is generally ſo ordered by Nature, that the higher <hi>Branches</hi> have moſt commonly ſome Advantage both in their length and thickneſs over the lower.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall reſume my former Compariſon of a Brook, which having its Courſe retarded for ſome time by a <hi>Digue</hi> or <hi>Dam,</hi> is hindred from continuing its Progreſs to its deſigned Journey's end. This Water then, which we will ſuppoſe amaſs'd together in a conſiderable quantity, as we ſee in larger Ponds, coming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to find divers Vents of equal Capacity, as well in the Body of the Dam which principally ſuſtained its Preſſure, as in the Walls built on each ſide of it, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it within ſuch a compaſs: This Water, I ſay, having either found or made theſe Breaches, will iſſue out at the ſame inſtant through all of them; but for the moſt part will run out in a much greater Stream, and with a ſtronger Current, at
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48210:263"/>
the breach of the Dam it ſelf, than at the Crannies of the ſides, and ſtill faſter in proportion, through thoſe breaches which have an aperture neareſt reſembling that of the Dam, than through thoſe which are more unlike. This ſo remarkable a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is caus'd by the Preſſure of the Water, haſtning continually towards its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which preſſure ſtill encreaſes the nearer it approaches to that Centre, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the meaneſt Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sap</hi> produces almoſt the ſame effect in the Branches of Trees; for having found in them ſeveral Apertures of an equal bigneſs, which we call Eyes, it makes its way at the ſame time through thoſe in the upper parts, but principally, and in greater abundance, through the laſt Eye, (That I mean, which is in the very Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Branch) and where the <hi>Sap</hi> makes its ſtrongeſt Effort, than it does through the others which are at ſome diſtance. 'Tis true if there be ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberance of <hi>Sap,</hi> that the parts of it which aſcended firſt are preſs'd forwards by the ſucceeding ones, it will then diſcharge it ſelf into the lower Eyes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more plentifully into thoſe which are neareſt to the top of the Branch, than into thoſe which are at a greater diſtance from it.</p>
                     <p>And as it falls out ſometimes that a Stream encloſed by a Dam in the Front, and by Walls on each ſide, by ſtriving to force its way out, happens to make a greater Eruption through one of its ſides than through the Dam it ſelf, ſo that the Water guſhes out in great abundance, where in all probability one ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it in a leſſer quantity. Juſt ſo we frequently Experience it in Trees, that the New Sprouts which ſhoot out at the Extremities of a Pruned Branch, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bigger do oftentimes prove much leſs than any of thoſe which at the ſame time grew out of it in other places.</p>
                     <p>Now, that I may give the beſt Reaſon I can of this Effect, which is ſo contrary to the Natural Courſe of the <hi>Sap;</hi> I conceive that this Alteration may proceed from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Sap</hi> endeavouring by its Natural Activity to make its Principal Paſſage through the Extremities of the Pruned Branch, is diverted by ſome Internal Cauſe which the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> cannot always diſcover; and being prevented by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle from riſing up in a full Stream to that Extremity, ſome part of it only can get through, but the more Spirituous and Active Particles of that Stream having inſinuated themſelves into ſome one of thoſe Eyes which were next below the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, begin there to exert their utmoſt Vigour, and communicate their Virtue to the remoter Eyes in greater or leſſer quantity, according as they are more or leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from that part of the Branch which ſerv'd as a Canal to Convey that Torrent of <hi>Sap</hi> to the Extremities of the Branches.</p>
                     <p>That little Portion of <hi>Sap</hi> which paſſed to the uppermoſt Eye or Eyes, having there produced Branches of but an indifferent bigneſs, communicates to them what it uſes to do to all the weak Branches; namely a great Diſpoſition to a quick Production of Fruit Buds. And upon this Account I take a particular Care in the Pruning my Trees, of this Branch, as of the greateſt value and importance to be Preſerved for the raiſing of Fruit.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs it is a difficulty which neither my long Study, nor diligent Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation have been able to Solve, how this <hi>Sap</hi> in proportion to its greater or leſſer Quantity ſhould produce ſuch different Effects. That it does ſo is very evident, and thence it was that I laid down this Paradox, That the Fruit is a Symptom of the Branches weakneſs; but the manner how, or the reaſon why this comes to be ſo, I have not yet been able to comprehend.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I find it leſs Difficult to give an Account how Soil comes to decay and grow Barren, by bearing thoſe Plants which are not of its Native Growth, ſuch as Corn, Trees, Pulſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but will not become lank or exhauſted by a plentiful Production of Thiſtles, Nettles, and many other Weeds.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe Obſervations, I think I may ſafely aver, that in all that Infinite variety of Speculations that ſerve for the Entertainment of our Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, there is not perhaps any Subject more Nice and Intricate to adjuſt rightly than that of <hi>Vegetation.</hi> 'Tis, I confeſs, a Field of very large Extent, and open to all the World, where every one has free liberty to enter and make what reſearches he pleaſes, though very few have had the good Fortune to ſucceed in the attempt. So many are the particular differences that perplex it, that nothing is ſo eaſie or ſo common as to fall into great miſtakes about it, when we pretend from our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon one Plant, to make Inferences concerning another; and from thence proceed to lay down ſeveral Concluſions and General Maxims.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the different Effects of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the Outward Parts of the <hi>Plants.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THough it be very probable that the Formation of the Roots, and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Plants, ſo far as it is tranſacted under Ground, is performed by Nature in the ſame manner, as I have formerly explain'd it in the Ch. of Plants. Yet as to their outward Appearance, they may not unfitly be compared to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little Republicks, each of them differing from the other in their Government, and having nothing in their manner of Acting common with their Neighbours, but the Polity of the one being pretty often quite contrary to that of the other. Thus we ſee, for inſtance, that Birds, though they all agree in the way of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their Species, <hi>viz.</hi> by Eggs, do notwithſtanding differ in their bigneſs and colour, in their Note, their way of Living, Acting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nature has Impreſs'd ſo great a diverſity in all <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as if ſhe had deſign'd as well to make us admire that Inexhauſted Stock of Variety in her Productions, as to confound and dazle the Underſtanding of Mankind, when it preſumes to Dive into the Myſteries of her Workmanſhip, and pretends to give Reaſons for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeſt of her Operations.</p>
                     <p>There have been in all Ages ſome very Ingenious Perſons, who have made it their buſineſs to become knowing in this Faculty; and even at this preſent time we ſee many that Study it with extraordinary Application. But the Misfortune is, that if we happen to make any, though but an inconſiderable Diſcovery, into the Nature of ſome one <hi>Vegetable,</hi> beyond the Medicinal Properties of it, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently too apt to flatter our ſelves with a belief, that we have attain'd to a perfect Underſtanding of it both in the Cauſe, and Manner, of its Being, and from thence make no ſcruple to infer Concluſions concerning others alſo; whereas if we look into the Matter but a little further, there will immediately occur to us ſo many Plants of a quite contrary Nature, as are more than enough to confound our Judgments, and deſtroy our Hypotheſis, or at leaſt to give a fatal blow to the greateſt part of what we pretend to lay down as Univerſal Maxims.</p>
                     <p>For inſtance, if we conſider the proceſs of Maturation, or what part it is that grows Ripe ſooneſt in <hi>Pears, Apples, Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. As likewiſe if we do but obſerve the order of Production in the Flowers of the <hi>Tubereuſe, Lilly, Hyacinth, Larks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet,</hi> viz. which of their Buds come to be firſt blown, we ſhall certainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ind that both in thoſe Fruits and Flowers, that part which is next to the Stalk, and ſo to the Bole and Roots, and which conſequently doth firſt receive its Being and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth alſo get the advantage of Priority in Ripening and Blowing. Which Ripeneſs as it is, with relation to Mans Uſe, the higheſt degree of its Perfection, ſo in reſpect to the duration of the Fruit or Flower, it is the neareſt ſtep to its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. This Conſideration, I ſay, is enough to encline one, to lay down this as a General Rule, That in all Plants, the nearer any Part is to that Place from whence it receives its Nouriſhment, ſo much ſooner doth that Part arrive to its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and Perfection.</p>
                     <p>But how ill grounded this Aſſertion would be, is ſufficiently Demonſtrated by what we continually ſee in <hi>Figs, Melons, Peaches, Plums, Abricots,</hi> &amp;c. namely that the beſt part, and which Ripens ſooneſt, is furtheſt from the Stalk, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that which is at the greateſt diſtance both from the Bole and Roots.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Orange-Trees, Jeſſimines, Pinks, Musk Roſes,</hi> &amp;c. the Buds that Flower firſt, are thoſe Growing at the Extremities of the Branches; and indeed, there needs no more to the putting our Naturaliſt to an Abſolute <hi>Non plus,</hi> than only to bid him conſider the Nature of the <hi>Rasberry</hi> and <hi>Roſe-Laurel Trees,</hi> neither of which keep any conſtant order either in the Ripening of their Fruit or Blowing of their Bud; for ſometimes that which is furtheſt off Ripens or Blows firſt, and ſometimes that which is neareſt. This unequal, or rather diſorderly way of acting, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extream difficulty be fix'd or ſtated by any General Maxims.</p>
                     <p>Thus then we ſee, that inſtead of laying down one General Aphoriſm concerning the order of Nature in the Ripening of Fruit, and Blowing of Flower Buds, we muſt deliver as many different Maxims as there are different Specie; of Fruits and Flowers upon the whole Face of the Univerſe.</p>

Again, if in the Spring we Examine what <hi>Branch</hi> it is out of which moſt Fruit. Grows, as <hi>Pears, Apples, Peaches, Plums, Abricots, Cherries, Goosberries,</hi> &amp;c. it will appear to be upon the Boughs of at leaſt one or two years former Growth, for here it was that the <hi>Fruit-Buds</hi> did upon the fall of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the preceding Summer receive their firſt Formation.</p>
                     <p>Now having gain'd this Point of Knowledge, we are tempted to infer from thence that all Bloſſoms have their Being a long time before the Fruit, but then on the other ſide, let us but look upon the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Wallnut-Tree,</hi> the Great <hi>Cheſnut,</hi> the <hi>Quince-Tree,</hi> the <hi>Rasberry-Buſh,</hi> &amp;c. and we ſhall ſee that in theſe Nature has Acted in a quite different manner than ſhe uſually doth in other <hi>Trees:</hi> For in thoſe I have now mentioned, the Bloſſoms precede the Fruit but a very few days, ſince both the Bloſſoms and the Fruit Grow only upon ſuch Branches as were put forth themſelves but that very Spring, and are almoſt Contemporaries in their Birth with the Bough it ſelf that is to ſupport them. However there is this difference between them, That <hi>ſome</hi> Fruits are form'd at the very <hi>extremity</hi> of the Bough, as <hi>Wallnuts, Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Quinces,</hi> and theſe for the moſt part do entirely put a ſtop to the Branches Growing any further, except only that on the <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Cheſnut-Trees,</hi> we ſee ſometimes that after the <hi>Nuts</hi> have received their formation at the top of the Bough, there will yet riſe <hi>Sap</hi> enough to make it grow conſiderably longer. Other Fruits there are which are produced on the lower part of the Branch, and theſe never hinder the Extenſion or Lengthning of it, as the <hi>Grape,</hi> the <hi>Mulberry,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we ſee what a mighty difference there is in the manner of the Production of ſeveral Fruits.</p>
                     <p>If we look, in the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> upon that part of the Branch which is firſt ſtripp'd of its Leaves, it will preſently appear that in moſt Trees it is the Top that firſt ſhews it ſelf bare, as if the <hi>Roots</hi> not being then ſo vigorous in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Heat of the <hi>Air</hi> not ſtrong enough to ſupply their Neceſſities, the <hi>Sap</hi> thereupon became incapable of riſing to its uſual heighth; but now on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Peaſe, Beans, Artichokes, Cabbage,</hi> and moſt ſorts of <hi>Pulſe</hi> or <hi>Legumes;</hi> as alſo in <hi>Almond</hi> and <hi>Peach-Trees,</hi> that are very vigorous and thriving; we find the lower part is firſt dried and decayed, whilſt at the ſame time the Top continues its Verdure, and Shooting forth. Can any thing be more irreconcileable than theſe two effects of <hi>Sap</hi> ſo contrary one to another?</p>
                     <p>In all Trees whether of Stone or Kernel Fruit, Ocular Experience tells us that the Fruit grows always juſt in the ſame place where its Bloſſom grew, as if the Bloſſom in its <hi>Exit</hi> or falling off ſeem'd only to give way to the coming of the Fruit, for whoſe ſake it was blown; but now in <hi>Wallnut-Trees, Cheſnuts</hi> and <hi>Haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>enuts,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Turky Wheat,</hi> &amp;c. we find no Fruit where the Bloſſoms were, ſo far rather to the contrary, that in thoſe Trees the Fruit is produced at the very end of the Branch where not one Bloſſom appear'd, and in <hi>Turky Wheat,</hi> the Bloſſom is form'd at the Top of the Stalk, and the Seed grows out from the very middle of each of the lower Leaves.</p>
                     <p>As to the order or proceſs of Nature in the Production of Fruits, the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it is made by the <hi>Fruit-buds,</hi> and as we have ſaid already concerning <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-Trees,</hi> every Bud contains in it ſeveral Bloſſoms, and conſequently ſeveral Fruits alſo; as in <hi>Stone Fruit-Trees</hi> every Bud contains but one Bloſſom, and therefore but one ſingle Fruit. In the midſt of every one of theſe Bloſſoms, there is a little Sting or Active Particle, from which within three or four days after Blowing the Fruit is form'd if the Weather prove favourable; that is, if the Rigor of the Cold do not deſtroy theſe precious Embryo's or Beginnings; ſo that ordinarily every Species of Fruit is Uſher'd in by its Bloſſom. But here we muſt except the <hi>Fig,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced entirely, and all at once, without any Bloſſom; and in <hi>Melons, Cucumbers, Gourds,</hi> &amp;c. the Fruit it ſelf appears before the Bloſſom, for it is not till ſome days after the Production of the <hi>Melon,</hi> that the Bloſſom which grows out of the Top of it receives its compleat Formation, and afterwards proceeds to Blowing. 'Tis upon the thriving of this Bloſſom that the Perfection of the Fruit depends; ſo that if that prove unable to reſiſt the Cold, and all its other Enemies, the Fruit will dye almoſt as ſoon as it is Born.</p>
                     <p>It is further obſervable, that though for the moſt part there remaineth nothing of the Bloſſom with the Fruit, ſo that this is not wont to appear before the Bloſſom is entirely gone, yet notwithſtanding we find that in the <hi>Pomegranate</hi> there is left ſome part of the Bloſſom which goes to the Conſtruction or Compoſition of it; unleſs you will ſay rather that part of the Fruit grows at the ſame time with the Bloſſom
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48210:265"/>
and is to it, if I may uſe the Compariſon, like a Cradle or Shell, and this as well for the preſervation of it, as to ſerve for a cover both to that ſort of congealed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and to the Grains or Kernels which are the very Eſſence and Subſtance of this Fruit.</p>
                     <p>In an Acorn the firſt thing that appears is a kind of Shell or Husk, of a Figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween round and flat, that ſhews it ſelf about the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> and which we may ſay ſerves in ſtead of a Bloſſom to it, ſince indeed it has no other: and out of the middle of this Husk the Acorn it ſelf grows, which Tradition tells us was the principal Food of Mankind in the Primitive Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p>Now as every Tree is compoſed of ſeveral Branches, ſome ſtrong and others weak, if we examine the place whereon ordinarily the Fruit grows, we find that Nature has induſtriouſly choſen to fructifie upon the weaker, and not upon the ſtronger Branches.</p>
                     <p>But now in Vines and Fig-Trees it is juſt the contrary, for it is generally ſeen that Grapes and Figs very rarely grow upon the weak Branches, but are in great plenty upon thoſe that be thicker, ſtronger and more vigorous. How then is it poſſible to reduce to one Maxim this inconſiſtency of Nature in chuſing ſuch different Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Production of Fruit?</p>
                     <p>If we conſider after what manner Trees are extended in length both in their Trunk and Branches, we find this remarkable Circumſtance, namely, that in the Spring and Summer whilſt the Sap acts moſt briskly, that which was the Top or Extremity of a Bough this moment, ceaſes to be ſo the next; by reaſon that the Sap aſcending continually without intermiſſion, ſtill puts out new Leaves above the precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; and the new ſhoot receives the ſame Treatment from the ſucceeding Sap, that it gave to that extremity of the Branch which immediately preceded it.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary in Artichokes, Aſparagus, Grapes, in all Leafs, and Fruits, in Tulips Pinks, and moſt ſorts of Flowers, we ſee that what was once the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme part, always continues ſo, ſo that their Augmentation or Growth is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and not form'd outwardly, as Experience ſhews us it is in Trees. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus, Artichoke, Tulip and moſt ſorts of Flowers appear plainly to grow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, though but in ſmall Threads or Filaments, out of the very ſubſtance or heart of the Plant, and afterwards encreaſe in thickneſs in the inſide of it by the aſſiſtance or ſupply of the Adventitious Nouriſhment. So that if we conſider by what ſmall and almoſt imperceptible degrees they riſe up from their Stalk, and are puſh'd up by the new Sap, it ſeems to have ſome reſemblance in the manner of its growth with a Syringe, where the Sucker is thruſt through the exteriour Tube till it come out through the Top of it.</p>
                     <p>Again, If we conſider what it is that cauſes the whiteneſs and delicacy of tyed Lettuce, Celeri, the Spaniſh or White Thiſtle, the Leek, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will appear to be either from their having been cover'd with dry Dung, dry Leaves, Earth or Mould, whereby they are hindred from receiving the uſual freſhneſs and virtue of the open Air.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that the parts thus covered being no longer penetrated by the Sun-beams, do not only loſe, together with their beautiful Green colour, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had of toughneſs, or of a bitter unpleaſant taſte; but alſo acquire a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whiteneſs, accompanied with that agreeable and delicate Reliſh for which they are ſo much eſteem'd. But in Aſparagus the caſe is quite otherwiſe, for in that we find thoſe parts the tougheſt and moſt ungrateful to the Palate which by their being deprived of the Suns immediate preſence, by the Mould or Dung that covered them, were become perfectly white: Whereas on the contrary the beſt and ſweeteſt parts are thoſe which are Green and Reddiſh. This in my Opinion is an inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable difficulty, that the being expoſed to the Air ſhould make ſome Plants tender, and others tough and hard at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Dazies and Gilliflowers are for ſome time white, but a little after, the Sun by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees changes them from White, into the moſt beautiful Red in the World.</p>
                     <p>In Pinks and Tulips, that Vivid Red which adorns them in their firſt blowing, forſakes them after the Sun has ſhin'd upon them for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>Moſt ſorts of Pears are coloured in the Bloſſom, and afterwards become Green, Grey, White or Yellow, and ſome of them towards the latter end, when they are near ripening, reſume a more lively Red than ever they had before.</p>
                     <p>Apricocks, as they advance nearer to Maturity, change from Green to White, and from thence turn to an admirable Vermillion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48210:265"/>
The Suns Influence makes early Peaches white, Mulberries black, Cherries, Straw-berries, Rasberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of an Orient redneſs, moſt kinds of Peaches of a Purple colour: In ſhort, it gives an incredible variety of Tinctures, both to Plums and other Fruits, as well as to all ſorts of Flowers. You ſee here how many Inſtances I have given of very material Differences.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Leaves of Plants and Trees, we commonly find but one upon a Stalk, and they grow upon the Boughs Chequerwiſe, in little Stories or Steps at a ſmall diſtance from each other. But nevertheleſs in ſome Trees we find growing upon one Stalk, three, five, or ſeven Leaves: as in the Elder, Walnut, and Roſe-Lawrel-Tree; upon others ſeven, nine, or eleven, as in the Aſh-Tree: Nay, upon others to the number of ſeventeen, nineteen, and twenty one, as in the Acacia; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with an odd Number. And it is obſervable, that when ſo many Leaves are found upon one Stalk, they never grow in Stories or Chequer'd, as I juſt now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, but are diametrically oppoſite one to another.</p>
                     <p>In Mulberry-Trees we ſee that in <hi>May,</hi> out of every Eye or Bud that was upon the Branches of the precedent Year, there grow ordinarily four or five Mulberries: Nay, ſometimes there appears a new Shoot, which is either longer or ſhorter in proportion to the quantity of Sap that was convey'd to the Bud from whence it ſprung.</p>
                     <p>In Fig-Trees, out of the Navel or midſt of every Leaf coming between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring and the middle of <hi>June,</hi> (which is about the time of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <hi>Solſtice,</hi> and conſequently of the greateſt Exuberance of the Sap) there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly grows a Fig at <hi>Autumn,</hi> of that kind we call ſecond Figs: But the number of them in our Climate does not exceed five or ſix, or ſeven at moſt, and that upon every good Branch only.</p>
                     <p>I ſay upon every good Branch only, becauſe all Branches have not the advantage of being ſo: For inſtance, ſuch as are weak, and thoſe great Suckers that riſe out of the foot of the Tree, with all that ſprout from the extremity of the pruned Stock: And laſtly, even thoſe great Boughs, or falſe Shoots rather, that grow out of the Trunk of the Tree, muſt not come under that Denomination. So that indeed none are to be eſteem'd good Branches but ſuch as at their firſt ſhooting are of a due bigneſs, and following the Natural Order of Production in all Branches; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we have already diſcourſed in another place.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Figs which are uſually called Figs of the firſt Sap, begin to appear about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and grow on a ſuddain to an indifferent bigneſs before the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth yet of any Leaves: The Seat where they grow is that very point or place where thoſe Leaves were put forth the Summer before that had not produc'd any of thoſe above-mention'd ſecond Figs, which uſe to be ripe at <hi>Autumn.</hi> Theſe Figs of the firſt Sap ſeldom fail of being ripe at the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> or in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> if the cold do not happen to pinch them, and make them fall: Or if during the Summer they eſcape being ſpoiled by violent Rains or exceſs of Heat: As for the Figs of the ſecond Sap, there is no hope of their coming to perfection, except in thoſe which being put forth by Mid-<hi>June,</hi> were come almoſt to their full bigneſs before the end of <hi>July;</hi> and even then it muſt be in a hot and dry Soil, and when it proves a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <hi>Autumn,</hi> and free from Froſts, and cold Rains, as it was in the Years 1670, and 1676.</p>
                     <p>Neither are Figs the only Fruits that are formed out of the Navel or Middle of their Leaf, ſince it is no more than what is common to them with many others, particularly to the Acorn and Jaſmin. Grapes indeed grow in a quite contrary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Reverſe or Back-ſide of the Leaf: which is very ſtrange and ſingular. Nor is it leſs remarkable, that in moſt Vines they grow commonly but at the third, fourth, or fifth Knot, which is at the lower part of the Branch; whereas all other Fruits are born throughout the whole length of that Branch, which we call the Fruit-Branch, and in greater plenty toward the Top than Bottom of it.</p>
                     <p>Quinces bear almoſt in the ſame manner with Rasberries, Azeroliers, and Pome-granates, <hi>viz.</hi> at the end of the ſmall Branches ſprouting from the Great Ones in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April:</hi> But if a Pear-Tree be graffed upon a Quince, it beareth only upon thoſe Branches that are of a Year or two's growth.</p>
                     <p>In all Plants the greateſt part of the Sap, as I have often ſaid, commonly riſes up between the Bark and the Tree; and perhaps ſome of it may aſcend through the Wood it ſelf: But in the Vine, which to ſpeak properly has no Bark, the Sap evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently riſes through the Subſtance or Body of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48210:266"/>
The increaſing of the Fruit in bigneſs, is cauſed by its Nouriſhment or <hi>Sap,</hi> which being convey'd from the Branch by the Stalk, as through a Pipe, into the Fruit between the Skin or Paring, and the Pulp, is there reduced to a thicker, and more ſolid Conſiſtence conformably to its reſpective Nature. And probably both the Wood of the Tree, and Stalk of the Fruit receive their Increaſe in Bulk much after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Nature has obſerved this Order in her Productions, that generally the faireſt Fruit grows upon the Top of the Bough, that the weakeſt Boughs are moſt fruitful in bearing, and that they bear but once a year. In <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> ſhe doth not keep to this Rule: For <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> bears Fruit twice a year. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It bears only upon the bigger Branches, ſo that (in <hi>Autumn</hi> particularly) thoſe <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> bears only, that are old enough to be of a ſufficient Strength and Vigor. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The earlieſt and largeſt Figs grow fartheſt from the Top, the others in proportion to their greater or leſſer Diſtance from it, advance more or leſs in their Forwardneſs and Bigneſs, and commonly they follow the ſame Order of Succeſſion in their Ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they did at their firſt growing.</p>
                     <p>The manner of the <hi>Indian Fig-Tree</hi>'s bearing its Fruit without the Support of any Trunk or Branches, and making uſe of its Leaves only to multiply and grow upon, is, in my Opinion, as ſurpriſing a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> as any of thoſe Objects which daily attract our Admiration.</p>
                     <p>Ordinarily moſt of our Plants are ſome time in the Bloſſom before they run up to Seed. But <hi>Purſlain</hi> runs to Seed almoſt without any Bloſſom at all: For as ſoon as the Stem is grown to a ſufficient Bigneſs, it begins to riſe up in ſeveral Stalks, all of them ſeparated from each other, and produces a Seed, which at firſt is white and tender. This Seed, which is contained in little Pods, as it ripens, becomes black and hard, and then the Pods opening themſelves, diſcover the little Treaſure includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, which before they had ſo carefully conceal'd.</p>
                     <p>The Difference of Colours in Fruit Bloſſoms, is very remarkable. <hi>Pears, Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> have a White Bloſſom: <hi>Apple-Trees</hi> a Red, <hi>Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> an Orange-colour, and <hi>Peach-Trees</hi> a light Purple; and of theſe Bloſſoms, ſome are double, ſome ſingle; ſome great, ſome middle-ſiz'd, and others very ſmall. That indented, or jagged Figure wherewith Nature has wantonly adorned moſt ſorts of Vigetables, and which by its different Cut or Edging, in every Species, gave Mankind the firſt Hint that hath ſince furniſh'd him with ſo many Varieties: This Artificial, and Curious Edging, may very well deſerve ſome Place in our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Meditations.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Circumſtances attending the Bulbs of <hi>Tulips,</hi> we cannot but acknowledge that Philoſophy has not yet been able to give us a ſatisfactory Account of them. They are put into the Ground in <hi>October,</hi> and there take Root, and in <hi>March</hi> following, each of them puts out a Stalk, in order to Budding, and Bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in due time. Hitherto you will ſay, there is nothing extraordinary, ſince the ſame thing is always ſeen in the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> the <hi>Hyacinth, Tuberoſe, Jonquil,</hi> &amp;c. but here then lyes the Wonder, that this <hi>Tulip-Stalh,</hi> which grew manifeſtly out of the very Middle, or Center of the Bulb, juſt as the Stalk uſually grows out of the Middle in all other Bulbs, is at length remov'd from its firſt Seat, <hi>viz.</hi> the Center, to the Outſide, or Superficies of its Bulb; a peculiar Caſe which happens not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plant. Now who is it that can ſolve the Difficulty how this Tranſpoſition is brought to paſs? Does the Bulb force it back again? Or does it by a ſort of <hi>Leger de main</hi> in its Aſcent, penetrate the ſides of the Bulb? This indeed is a Myſtery in Vigetation that can never be look'd upon with ſufficient Aſtoniſhment and Admiration.</p>
                     <p>It would be an endleſs Labour, ſhould I particularize all my Obſervations of this kind in Vegetables: But theſe are ſufficient to demonſtrate, that every Plant has a peculiar, determinate, certain, and infallible Stint or Term, for the Beginning and Duration of its Action, for the Manner of its Appearance above Ground, for the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its Soil, for the Taſte, Colour, and ſize of its Fruit, for the Figure, Bigneſs, and Colour of the Seed, the Difference of its Leaves and Stalk, or for the Parts of the Tree where the Fruit and the Seed grows. And though, as I have ſaid divers times, it be very difficult to explain all theſe peculiar Differences by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pores, the different Configuration of Parts, or Atoms of a Figure, juſtly proportioned for the Penetration of them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here, notwithſtanding, conclude this Subject at preſent, after I have given the Reader my Thoughts concerning that Circulation of the Sap, which ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have diſcovered in Plants.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Reflections upon their Opinion that maintains the Circulation of the <hi>Sap.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS I am of Opinion, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is in the <hi>Spring,</hi> a certain Rarefaction in all Vegetables, which is the firſt Mover in Vegetation. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is in every Plant a Vital Principle, which being a neceſſary Agent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the firſt Effects of that Rarefaction, as I have already diſcourſed elſewhere. So I cannot think of any Compariſon fitter, to make my Notion intelligible, than that of a Clock, which needs no more to ſet it going, than only to pull up the Weight, and give a little Jog to the Pendulum—The Truth is, I always thought it abſolutely impoſſible to make this pretended Circulation conſiſtent with the Action of the Roots, which we daily ſee to extend themſelves both in Length and Thickneſs at the very ſame Inſtant that they receive their Nouriſhment. And the Objections that prevail'd with me, were theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I cannot apprehend either at what time, or in what Place this Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould begin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot ſee either any Neceſſity, or Advantage of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſing we ſhould admit it, I am in the dark, whether we muſt aſſert one general Circulation only in every Tree, or whether there muſt be as many Circulations, as there are particular Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Time when it begins, if there be ſuch a Circulation, it muſt certainly have its Beginning the very ſame Inſtant that the Roots begin their Action, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt owe that very Beginning to the Influence and Virtue of the Roots; ſo that conſequently there may be a Time when there will be no Circulation, for as much as the Roots are not continually in Action. Now, as the principal Reaſon of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of Circulation in Animals is drawn from the Neceſſity of it, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Purifying the Blood, which, we are told, would be in great Danger of being corrupted, if not kept in continual Motion: So if that Inſtance hold in Plants, it muſt then alſo follow, that the <hi>Sap</hi> would be in the like Danger of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that very firſt Moment of its Circulations being intermitted; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we ſhould ſee a general Mortality of all thoſe Trees that ſhould happen not to be in Action; whatever the Cauſe of it might be, whether their being hindred by the Froſt, or their lying out of the Ground; and much more, that all Branches, when once ſeparated from the Tree that bare them, muſt immediately periſh; juſt as the Members, as ſoon as they are cut off from the Body. But now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more contrary to the Experience of every one, than this will, as appears evidently by that infinite Number of Plants, and Grafts, which are ſo frequently, and with ſuch good Succeſs, ſent into foreign Countries, without the leaſt ill Accident, provided they be not overmuch dry'd by exceſs of Heat.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing there be really ſuch a Circulation, and that it commences at the ſame time with the Action of the Roots: Yet how will they be able to ſolve the Production of thoſe Branches which ſhoot forth in the Spring, without any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Roots. That it is ſo, there can be no doubt, ſince we have Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it every Spring in Trees newly planted, and which have not yet put forth any new Roots. As alſo in Trees digg'd up in the Winter, and left lying on the Ground: and even Branches lopp'd off in that Seaſon, and ſet up an end in the Ground, will put out little Shoots in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>In fine, How is it poſſible to give a clear Account of this Circulation, when we find that Almonds, Nuts, and even common Seeds, ſhoot out within the Earth, and in a few days put forth a Root, growing in length downward, but do not cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Production to riſe up out of the Ground? When we ſee that, the Bulb of the <hi>Imperial</hi> will ſend out Roots in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but no Stalk; and on the contrary, other Bulbs put out Stalks in the <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> but no Roots; when <hi>Tulips, Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe's,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> grow upright in ſuch a manner, as that which was the extream Part at its firſt Appearance, ſtill continues ſo, and that all of it riſes entirely and at once from the Bottom to the Top; when the Sprouts ſhooting out from the Extremity of a Branch, which has been cut or cropt, have ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difference in Length and Thickneſs, as I have formerly deſcribed. It is, I think, ſufficiently clear from hence, that there is a very unequal Diſtribution made of the <hi>Sap;</hi> ſeeing that the Fruit-buds are form'd only upon the Top of the weak Branches, and grow only at the Bottom of the Strong. I muſt confeſs, it ſeems a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48210:267"/>
very difficult Task to me, to prove a Circulation in all theſe, and an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Examples, that I could produce upon this Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>If we can prove therefore that there is no Circulation in ſome Plants, I ſee no reaſon why we may not poſitively conclude againſt the Admiſſion of it in others.</p>
                     <p>But to give a further Demonſtration of the Impoſſibility of this Circulation, let us but conſider, that upon the Admiſſion of it, we muſt ſuppoſe in every Branch, three diſtinct, and ſeparate Paſſages, <hi>viz.</hi> two for the going, and returning of the imperfect <hi>Sap,</hi> and a third for the return of it when it is arriv'd at its Perfection, namely, to convey it to that Place where it is to make its Reſidence. I do not ſay there muſt be Paſſages for its <hi>Riſing</hi> and <hi>Deſcending,</hi> becauſe it happens very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the Branches hang downward, and Fruit-Branches generally grow in that Poſture; ſo that to ſpeak properly, we cannot ſay that the <hi>Sap Aſcends,</hi> when really it <hi>Deſcends;</hi> and for this Reaſon I choſe rather to ſay barely, that the <hi>Sap</hi> will need ſeveral <hi>Ways</hi> or <hi>Paſſages</hi> for the Conveyance of it in its going and return.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtance, I deſire to know where they will find theſe three diſtinct Paſſages in a Cherry-Stalk, or how the <hi>Sap,</hi> which in its firſt Motion, ſhould have riſen to the Extremity, or Top, and then return'd back immediately down to the Roots: how I ſay it ſhould be determin'd by Nature, to deſcend to the Cherry, which hangs down, and afterwards re-aſcend to that Place, where it turn'd out of the way that lead it upward, and from thence fall into that Path which was to convey it to the Root, and at laſt re-conduct it to the Place where it is finally lodg'd, to ſupply the Exigencies of the Fruit and Leaves.</p>
                     <p>I would ask further, Whether or no there be not a Circulation of <hi>Sap</hi> in the Fruit, as well as in the Tree; if ſo, then theſe two <hi>Saps,</hi> muſt, in their Return, have each of them their particular Way (which will cauſe a great Multiplication of Ways) or elſe they muſt neceſſarily mix together, and then would enſue an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Confuſion of the two <hi>Saps,</hi> one of which is affirm'd, by them, to be much Purer and Nobler than the other.</p>
                     <p>According to this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> muſt make a great many Journeys backward and forward, which is a thing very diſagreeable to Nature, who affects to be plain and ſimple in all her Operations. Why therefore may we not rather ſay, that the <hi>Sap</hi> acquires its Perfection that very Moment in which it arrives at the Roots; juſt as the Air is illuminated in every part, immediately upon the Sun's beginning to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above the <hi>Horizon?</hi> But further, admitting that this Circulation were neceſſary for perfecting the <hi>Sap,</hi> I would fain be ſatisfy'd where it is that the <hi>Sap</hi> receives this Perfection. It cannot be at its firſt entrance into the Roots, becauſe, according to the Principles of our Antagoniſts, it is there but in an imperfect and indigeſted State; neither can it be when it is arrived at the Extremities of the Boughs, or Fruit, ſeeing it doth not continue there, but has yet two Stages to travel further; for if it take up its Reſt in thoſe Extremities, it muſt then follow, that it was come to its compleat Perfection, and conſequently would have no need of returning to its firſt Sourſe. Neither can it be ſaid to be thus perfect at its ſecond coming into the Roots, becauſe then certainly it would take up its final Reſidence with them; for ſince it is indifferent to the <hi>Sap,</hi> when it is once perfectly digeſted, whether it be employed in the Formation of the Roots, Trunk, or Branches, Leaves or Fruits; it would undoubtedly fix it ſelf in the very firſt Place, where it ſhould find it ſelf qualified with all the Degrees of Perfection requiſite to its Nature.</p>
                     <p>Again, Suppoſing that the Extremity, or Top of the Branch, to which the <hi>Sap</hi> was to have riſen, were cut off, I deſire to know in what manner this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Ways, and turning out of the one into the other, could be ſolved, and what would become of the <hi>Sap</hi> deſign'd to have been made into Fruit, if it ſhould be ſtopp'd in the midſt of the Way, before it could arrive at its Journey's End.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be deny'd that this Doctrine of Circulation, draws an infinite Number of Inconveniencies along with it, which, in my Judgment, can be prevented no other way, but by the following Account of the Proceſs of the <hi>Sap</hi> in Vegetation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Vital Principle, which is the <hi>Firſt Mover</hi> in the Action of the Plant, being Invigorated by the Warmth of the Sun, immediately communicates to that Moiſture, which was attracted by the Roots, ſuch a Quality as is neceſſary to the making of it perfect <hi>Sap,</hi> which nevertheleſs is not determined in its own Nature, to any particular. Production, but may indifferently become either Fruit, Leaves, or Trunk; and as that <hi>Sap</hi> has all the Degrees of Rarefaction that are requiſite for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48210:267"/>
it, it muſt neceſſarily be a light and ſubtil Body, and conſequently extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to riſe up to all the Extremities of the Branches. Where it is very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it exerts it ſelf, in producing a great Number of Boughs, and Leaves, all of them bearing a Size proportionable to the abundance of the aſcending <hi>Sap:</hi> If it aſcend but in a very ſmall Quantity, it is employ'd in bearing an infinite Number of Bloſſoms, and good ſtore of Fruit, though it will be but ſmall in its Dimenſions. And laſtly, where the <hi>Sap</hi> riſes in a moderate Proportion in ſome certain Places, as either upon the Top of the weak Branches, or the lower part of the Strong, it there ſignalizes it ſelf in the Productions of Buds, and of large and beautiful Fruit.</p>
                     <p>But now to give a clear and rational Account of this admirable Diſtribution of the <hi>Sap</hi> unto every part of the Tree, either for the Beginning, Continuing, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating, and Determining it in its juſt Bigneſs and Proportion, is a Work above Humane Performance. Nature ſeems expreſly to have deny'd us that Priviledge, as if ſhe had ſeem'd induſtriouſly to hide from us, under a thick Veil, the Manner, both of her Conception and Production; ſo that hitherto, our ordinary Faculties have not been able to fathom this myſterious Subject of Vegetation.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny but that there is a Circulation of the Blood in all Animals; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Veſſels with their Extremities and Inſertions, and indeed the whole Structure of their Body is ſo exactly entire, and perfect in all its Extent, as that we cannot conceive an abrupt Beginning or End of them. Hence it is that they are ſo excellently fitted for the Reception of the Blood and Spirits, and reſtraining them from iſſuing out at any Extremity. But in Trees, whoſe encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in length is continually form'd outwardly, we muſt ſuppoſe the Veſſels to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at their Extremities, and that they receive their Augmentation in length, on their Outſide, as the whole Maſs of the Tree doth; ſo that there is no Analogy between the Veſſels in the Body of an Animal, and thoſe in a Tree, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Inference deduced from that Compariſon, muſt needs be erroneous.</p>
                     <p>The third Queſtion, wherein I deſire to be ſatisfy'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that there be ſuch a Circulation, we muſt ſay that there is but one general Circulation in each reſpective Tree, or elſe that there are as many particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations as there are Branches, is perhaps as difficult to reſolve as any. For if we admit but one in general, we ſhall be hard put to it to give an Account how a Slip ſet in the Ground, comes to take, ſo as in a ſhort time to become a perfect Tree. We muſt be forc'd to ſay, that in every one of theſe Branches there was a true Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, which ceas'd from Action as ſoon as they were cut off from the Tree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they grew; but that as ſoon as by their Re-plantation they were reſtor'd to a Condition of Acting of themſelves, their Circulation alſo began to reſume its Action; and by theſe Steps they came to be perfect Trees.</p>
                     <p>If therefore, to give a Reaſon for this Growth of Slips, we muſt admit of a particular Circulation in every Branch, we muſt likewiſe be forc'd to admit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Circulations in every Branch. For ſince any Branch may be divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts, if every one of theſe Parts be ſet in the Ground, with all the due Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances belonging to them, they will as eaſily take to grow, as if they had been entire Branches. But this Solution will draw us into a <hi>Progreſſus in infinitum,</hi> than which, in Ratiocination, nothing can be more abſurd.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when a Layer of a Vine being put into the Ground, takes a new Root, and thereupon that Part of the Layer next to the Earth, which before was the ſmalleſt, becomes in a little time thicker than the Part next adjoyning to the Tree: Muſt we not of neceſſity have recourſe to a new Circulation, ſince the former ſeems plainly to be at an end, or at leaſt to have become altogether uſeleſs I muſt confeſs, I cannot find any Expedient of adjuſting all theſe particular Circulations, with the general one, to make them act in Conformity with, and Subordination to it, when they are all together in the ſame Tree at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>Such a Cloud of Difficulties and Inconveniencies have prevail'd with me not to give any Credit to this new Opinion of the Circulation of the <hi>Sap,</hi> though I have at the ſame time an extreme Veneration for thoſe Worthy and Learned Perſons, who are the Authors of it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Reflections upon the Opinion that maintains the Conveyance of the Nouriſhment through the upper parts of the <hi>Plant.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere have been ſome of Opinion that the Nouriſhment of the Tree is not only derived to it through the <hi>Pores,</hi> and by the Operation of the <hi>Roots</hi> in the Earth, but that there is likewiſe ſome Contribution of maintenance afforded by the Air, and ſubtilly conveyed to it through the upper parts of the Tree. This Opinion of theirs is grounded upon this Obſervation, That if you make a very ſtrait liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture round any <hi>Branch,</hi> or even if you ſtrip the <hi>Bark</hi> off it, the <hi>Boughs</hi> that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that part ſo tyed or ſtripp'd, will notwithſtanding encreaſe both in length and thickneſs.</p>
                     <p>But to this I Anſwer, Firſt, That in ſome <hi>Vegetables, viz.</hi> In <hi>Almonds,</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> as alſo in ordinary <hi>Seeds,</hi> there is no Neceſſity for this Aerial Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, ſince the whole Series of their <hi>Vegetation</hi> is performed in the Bowels of the Earth without having the leaſt Communication with the Air.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I Anſwer that it is impoſſible to tye any <hi>Branch</hi> ſo ſtraitly as that the <hi>Sap</hi> (a Liquor not only very ſubtil and delicate, but alſo very Impetuous in its Operation) ſhall not inſinuate it ſelf, and find ſome paſſage through; for tho' the main ſtream of the <hi>Sap</hi> riſes up between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> yet it is certain that ſome little quantity doth conſtantly penetrate through the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the ſolid <hi>Wood,</hi> neither is it any Wonder if Nature, who out of her great abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> does frequently perform ſuch extraordinary and ſurprizing Wonders, may likewiſe in this caſe force up the <hi>Sap</hi> (which was ſtop'd in its Aſcent either by that ligature or ſtripping off the <hi>Bark)</hi> through the very ſubſtance or <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Wood,</hi> in order to its Nouriſhing the upper parts of the Tree, which muſt Infallibly have periſhed without a ſeaſonable Supply.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I ſay it may be Anſwer'd with very good Reaſon, that this Diſtenſion or Tumor of ſuch tyed Branches in their breadth, and accretion to their length, may be Stiled rather a kind of Dropſie, than a real and firm Augmentation of their ſound ſubſtance and continuity; for Experience tells us, That in Trees thus tyed or ſtripp'd, the upper parts of the Tree come to dye in a very little time, as they muſt needs do if the Channel be not open'd again to give a free paſſage to the true Nouriſhment of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>Now to give ſome other Inſtances, to confirm our Opinion, we may conſider that thoſe Plants whoſe <hi>Roots</hi> lye very deep in the Ground, as <hi>Tulip-bulbs,</hi> &amp;c. do always grow up to the greateſt heighth.</p>
                     <p>As alſo we may obſerve the <hi>Pointed</hi> and <hi>Pyramidal</hi> Extremity of all Branches; every one of which ſeem in the manner of their Growing, as with one conſent, Naturally to tend upward.</p>
                     <p>To which we may add, as another Corroborating Circumſtance, the <hi>ſhooting</hi> out of new Sprouts, upon the Back or Elbow of ſuch Branches as are bent violently, or by force, to the Ground; the <hi>Suckers</hi> that grow out of the foot of the Tree when it has been injured at the top: the decay of the Branches at the Extremities notwithſtanding their being ſtill vigorous at the <hi>Root,</hi> as alſo the Withering and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Plants at the top of their Leaves in hot Weather when they are newly Set: All theſe Inſtances ſeem to me evidently Contradictory of any deſcent of the <hi>Sap</hi> which they ſuppoſe to be caus'd by the Influence of the Air, either upon the <hi>Bark</hi> of the Tree, or the Extremity of the Branches.</p>
                     <p>The different Taſtes in Fruits which always have a ſmack of their Soil, are a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof that their Nouriſhment is derived from a Soil of ſuch a Savour, and not from the Air, which has none at all; and certainly if any of the <hi>Sap</hi> could find a paſſage acroſs, or through the ſolid Wood, it might as well enter in the ſame manner through the Skin of the Fruit; and ſo the Stalk, which by a long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription has hitherto been look'd upon as the true and only Channel for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the Aliment to the Fruit, would have a great many Partners in that Office, and conſequently become in a manner wholly uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny but that it is highly neceſſary for Trees to enjoy the benefit of a temperate Air, whereby the Bark may be rendered the more pliable and eaſie to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48210:268"/>
be dilated and loos'd from its incloſed <hi>Trunk,</hi> to give the freer paſſage for the <hi>Sap</hi> in its riſing up from the <hi>Root.</hi> Indeed, I can never be perſuaded to think that any Nouriſhment can be conveyed through that <hi>Rind,</hi> but am of Opinion rather, that a Tree depriv'd of all its Top Branches, in a very hot Region; as for inſtance, we may ſuppoſe a Row of Trees cut even at the Tops, and Planted in a Hedge to the South under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> would be ſo far from drawing in any Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the <hi>Bole,</hi> that even the <hi>Sap</hi> would be ſo much hindred by the heat of the Air from aſcending by its ordinary paſſage, as that the upper part of the Tree would Infallibly periſh; whence it would follow, that the <hi>Sap</hi> being made unable to riſe up to the ſmall upper Boughs, would burſt out at the foot into an infinite number of new and ſmall Productions.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe who from the Experiment of making an Inciſion into a Tree, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove this Intromiſſion of <hi>Sap</hi> into the upper part, or to defend the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Sap</hi> from that Liquor which will run plentifully out of ſuch an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in my Opinion they build their Hypotheſis upon a very Sandy Foundation.</p>
                     <p>For, Firſt, If we either cut or break off the Top of any <hi>Plant,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> will be ſeen plainly to guſh out in great abundance from each of the two Extremities bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of every <hi>Pore,</hi> as well in that part which retain'd its Situation, as in the other which was ſeparated from the former.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the Inciſion be made at the bottom, there will run out not only ſome part of that <hi>Sap</hi> which is continually aſcending, but alſo a little of that which being already upon its riſe, and having till then been ſupported by the ſucceeding <hi>Sap,</hi> muſt of neceſſity fall down when deſtitute of that Support and Foundation of which it was depriv'd by that Inciſion.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, If this Inciſion were a ſufficient proof of this Aſſertion, it muſt follow that all the uppermoſt <hi>Sap</hi> muſt make its way out at one ſingle hole, as we ſee the Water in a Veſſel runs all out at any hole it meets with: But Experience tells us, That how many Inciſions ſoever you make, either above or below the firſt, the <hi>Sap</hi> will iſſue through all of them, but moſt abundantly through the loweſt, and in leaſt quantity through the higheſt, which certainly muſt proceed from the Reaſon which I have given before.</p>

                        <p>Reflections upon the undiſtinguiſhable likeneſs of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Wood, Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere is hardly any <hi>Plant</hi> growing with us, during the whole Summer, puts out more <hi>Roots,</hi> and conſequently produces greater plenty of <hi>Sap,</hi> than the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> does; ſo that we may venture to build our Obſervations concerning <hi>Sap</hi> in general, upon ſuch Remarks as a particular Enquiry into the Nature of this Tree will afford us: The <hi>Sap</hi> whereof appears to me to have exactly the ſame Colour, Taſte, and Conſiſtence both in the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and the <hi>Stalk</hi> both of the <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> that it has in the <hi>Fruit</hi> it ſelf, whilſt it is yet Green; for when it comes to be Ripe and fit for Gathering, there is not the leaſt ſign to be perceived of that white <hi>Sap</hi> with which it was ſo plentifully impregnated before it was come to Maturity.</p>
                     <p>From hence we may very well advance this general concluſion, That there can be no material difference between that <hi>Sap</hi> which goes to the forming of the Fruit, and that which enters into the Compoſition of all the other parts of the Tree, ſince there is ſo great a Conformity between them at the time of its paſſing out of the Stalk into the Fruit. So that admitting the <hi>Sap</hi> for Fruit to be endued with ſome particular degrees of Perfection beyond what are to be found in the <hi>Sap</hi> of the Tree, yet what do they think becomes of it, when the Fruit which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to have form'd and nouriſh'd, chances to periſh, as oftentimes it doth, even in the <hi>Embryo,</hi> or at leaſt before it comes to Perfection? In this caſe it muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be mixed with the reſt of the <hi>Sap,</hi> and be equally employ'd with it in the Production of ſomething that is not Fruit.</p>
                     <p>And this will ſuggeſt the Reaſon to us why Trees without Fruit abound more in Wood than thoſe that bear Fruit plentifully; which according to the Opinion I ever had, is nothing elſe but the different proportions of the <hi>Sap;</hi> the ſmaller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48210:269"/>
whereof cauſes plenty of Bloſſoms and Fruits, as the greater quantity produces the like Encreaſe both in the Body and Leaves.</p>
                     <p>To this may be added, what I have already repeated ſo often, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Fruit grows at the Top of the weak Branches, but at the Bottom of the ſtrong; whence it appears, that no part of the Branch is exempted from bearing, and that they are under a very great miſtake, who, while they pretend to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why the weak Branches are generally moſt loaded with Fruit, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the Extremities, put us off with this Reaſon, That it is for the better concoction and refining of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which (ſay they) can be effected no other way than by ſo long a Paſſage and Percolation through the narrow Conveyances.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe this Fancy had ſome probability of Reaſon in it, how ſhall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Production of <hi>Grapes, Quinces, Mulberries, Azerolles, Rasberries, &amp;c.</hi> which receive their Formation at the ſame time that the Wood does upon which they grow: For Example: There grows upon every old Branch of a <hi>Vine</hi> that uſed to be Pruned in the Spring, as many new Branches as there were Eyes left upon it. Upon theſe Branches, and at the very ſame time with them are the <hi>Grapes</hi> formed, which ordinarily do not grow nearer to the end than the third, fourth, or fifth Knot, for from that diſtance the Branch runs up only in length, without bearing any Fruit.</p>
                     <p>This being granted, which indeed cannot be denied, I would ask them what Ground they have to aſſert, That the <hi>Sap</hi> is not ſufficiently prepared till it arrive at one of theſe three Eyes, and there receive its perfect Digeſtion: for they divide the <hi>Sap</hi> into two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Digeſted, and Indigeſted; the former they tell us is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed both in forming the <hi>Grapes</hi> in ſome one of thoſe three Knots, and in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Leaves and Branches; and yet there is always ſome Wood, Pulp, and Husk of the <hi>Grape</hi> between every one of theſe Knots, to the Formation of which both theſe <hi>Saps</hi> did contribute.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, After this Secretion of the Digeſted <hi>Sap</hi> from the Indigeſted, they come both of them to be re-united in order to the Production of Boughs and Leaves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the remaining part of the Year. I muſt confeſs ingenuouſly, I am not quick enough to penetrate into, and comprehend theſe ſo ſubtile and refined No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our modern Philoſophers.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are ſome, as I have formerly obſerved in my <hi>Treatiſe of Pruning,</hi> who Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Production of <hi>Fruits,</hi> proceed the ſame way they do in their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Generation of <hi>Animals. Animals</hi> (ſay they) <hi>do not Procreate their Like, but when they are in their Vigor, Generation being an Act of Vigor in all Natural Productions.</hi> Now ſince <hi>Trees</hi> are alſo Natural Beings, 'twill hence follow, that they are never Capable of bearing Fruit, but when they are in their full Strength and Vigour, it being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to make the Production of <hi>Fruit</hi> a ſign of the Weakneſs of the <hi>Tree.</hi> And they further add. <hi>That in all the Works of Nature, the Cauſe is known by the Effects, and every</hi> Extraordinary <hi>Effect muſt be produced by a ſuitable Strength and Vigour in its Agent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe indeed are very plauſible Arguments and Inferences, and which, when mentioned by Perſons of Reputation, may prevail with ſuch as do not ſee into the Weakneſs of them.</p>
                     <p>But though I highly Eſteem the Perſons, and the Works of thoſe Ingenious Men, who Argue after this manner; yet, when to expoſe my Notions, they make me Advance ſuch a one as this: <q>That the abundance of Moiſture which makes the <hi>Trees</hi> produce a great quantity of Branches and Leaves, is an Effect of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour;</q> they muſt give me leave to ſay ſomething in my own Defence. I might well ſay, and now I ſay it again, That <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> on <hi>Trees</hi> are ſigns of their Weakneſs, or, that they have but little <hi>Sap;</hi> as on the contrary, a great number of fair <hi>Branches</hi> without <hi>Fruit,</hi> is of the Vigour, or of the abounding quantity of their <hi>Sap.</hi> For I do not think that the word <hi>Moiſture</hi> does properly ſignifie the <hi>Sap</hi> in a <hi>Tree,</hi> and therefore ſhould not be underſtood in that Aſſertion of mine for any thing elſe, but the <hi>moiſture</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> where a <hi>Tree</hi> is planted; there being ſo great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48210:269"/>
a Difference between it and <hi>Sap.</hi> And we ſeldom ſee any very great Quantity of <hi>Sap</hi> in ſuch Fruit-Trees as have very much Moiſture about their Roots. Nay, We ſometimes ſee them die, by having their Roots too much drenched in Water; and they will never take well in very wet Ground; whereas, for the moſt part, they afford both much <hi>Lop-wood</hi> and Fruit, if they have naturally a Vigorous vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and are planted in a good Earth, indifferently moſten'd, and do thereupon ſend forth good Roots to furniſh the upper Parts with a ſufficient Quantity of <hi>Sap.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Terms therefore of <hi>Moiſture</hi> and <hi>Sap,</hi> are not to be promiſcuouſly uſed, the one being to be underſtood only for that Nouriſhment which is in the Tree, and the other for ſuch Water as may be about the Root of it.</p>
                     <p>That which has given Occaſion for Mens arguing upon the Production of Plants, after the ſame manner they do upon the Generation of Animals, has been this, as I conceive, that they imagin'd the Fruit to be the ſame, in reſpect to the Tree, that the young Animal is to its Syre that begat it; and wou'd thence conclude, that as Lyon's Whelp'd, for Inſtance, exactly reſembles its Syre in all its Eſſentials, ſo a Pear, or a Cherry muſt, in its Formation, that of its Tree, ſeeing that in time it may grow up to be as tall and big, and every way like it, juſt as the young Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does at length equal the Old One, both in Largeneſs and Proportion of Parts.</p>
                     <p>Now Nature it ſelf plainly ſhews us, that it does not act the ſame way in both theſe Caſes; and that the moſt that can be gather'd from ſuch Conſiderations, is, hat one Part of the Fruit of each ſort of Trees, is the ſame with reſpect to its Tree, that the Seed of the Animals is to its reſpective Animal.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſo well skill'd in Anatomy, as to know, whether the Seminal Matter in Animals require as much Force and Vigor to be formed in the Body, as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards does in being duly employ'd in order to Generation: But ſure I am that no Man ever diſtinctly perceiv'd in himſelf, either the Time or Manner of its Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any more than he did thoſe Circumſtances of the Formation of his Muſcles, Bones, or Cartilages: and that 'tis certainly a Proviſion in Nature, that of the whole Maſs of Nouriſhment, one Part ſhould go to the making of Seed, and the reſt ſhould be imployed either to the Encreaſe, or the Preſervation of the Animal, without ever making any ſenſible Effort, either in Framing, or perfecting any of the Internal Parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, he will find himſelf mightily miſtaken, that ſhall lay down this as a ſtanding Rule, that every kind of Fruit is in the Nature of a Caſe to ſuch a Seed as is capable of producing the ſame ſort of Tree with that it ſelf grew upon. The moſt ordinary way of Multiplying Trees, being not by their Fruits. And indeed who ever ſaw a <hi>Prunier de Perdrigon,</hi> or a <hi>Bigarotier</hi> grow from the Stones of the Fruit? a <hi>Fig,</hi> or <hi>Mulberry-Tree</hi> from the <hi>Seed,</hi> a <hi>Bon-Chreſtien,</hi> or <hi>Bergamotte</hi> from the Kernels of ſuch Pears? Though I know 'tis common for an Oak to come of an <hi>Acorn,</hi> and a Cheſtnut-Tree of its Nuts, and ſome others to be produc'd in the ſame way; yet Nature has provided other ways of multiplying them, <hi>viz.</hi> by young Siens growing out at the Roots, and ſeveral ſorts of Graffs. Some of thoſe ways which Nature makes uſe of in preſerving the ſeveral Kinds of Trees, I have already treated of in another Place: And now I come poſitively to affirm,</p>
                     <p>That if a Man firſt lays down ſuch a Maxim as this, that the only Reaſon why ſome Fir-Trees thrive well, is, becauſe they grow on the South ſide of a Mountain; And that others do not, becauſe they ſtand on the North Side of it: And thence draw Inferences, and apply them to Fruit-Trees, ſuch Arguments muſt neceſſarily be very weak, for theſe two ſorts of Trees are ſubjects very different, and therefore ſhould be as differently conſidered.</p>
                     <p>For what is chiefly to be conſidered in Fruit-Trees, is ſcarcely at all taken notice of in Firrs. In theſe latter, we are only to compare one Part with another, that is, barely to conſider the whole Bulk and Extent of the Tree, to ſee whether it be good for Maſts, Planks, Beams, or Joiſts. But in the other, all the Branches are to be carefully conſidered, both the Great and Small, which may be of uſe, and which not. In theſe we obſerve the <hi>Working</hi> of Nature, in Diſtributing the <hi>Sap</hi> to every ſingle Part of the Tree. But in the other, only to what particular Uſe it may be put in the Building of a Ship. Nature is not concern'd whether ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Firr-Tree be fit for Boards, and whether, or no, it be put to that Uſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may not be improperly ſaid, that ſhe is highly concerned in the Productions of Fruit-Trees, which are to bethe Food of the nobleſt Part of the Creation. And yet of all that is performed in the whole Courſe of Vegetation, theſe Fruits
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48210:270"/>
coſt Nature the leaſt pains in making, and the Philoſopher the moſt in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them.</p>
                     <p>And the more to puzzle and confound the Curious Enquirers in the Works of Nature, it proceeds in the Formation and Nouriſhment of Trees in a way quite different from that wherein perfect Animals are Generated and Preſerved; As if it thereby deſigned to prevent the drawing of any manner of Conſequences from the one, whereby to underſtand or illuſtrate the other.</p>
                     <p>The Diſtribution of Nouriſhment in perfect Animals is made in equal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to each of the Members, which exactly anſwer one another; ſo that the Right Arm or Thigh uſually receives no more than the Left; and ſo of the reſt: Whereas in Fruit-Trees the Sap is diſtributed in very unequal Meaſures; few of the Branches being perfectly of the ſame bigneſs, but ſome very large, others very ſmall, and a third ſort of a middle ſize between both; and conſequently requiring a proportionable Quantity of Sap.</p>
                     <p>It alſo ſometimes happens that ſome of the ſmaller Branches receiving more Sap than that particular uſe for which they ſeem'd to be deſigned, did require, grow in a ſhort time to an extraordinary bigneſs; and on the contrary, others that at firſt ſeem'd large ones, receiving a leſs Quantity of Sap than was neceſſary, never grow much bigger than thoſe of the ſmaller ſize.</p>
                     <p>And this may not unfitly be illuſtrated by thoſe Alterations we frequently obſerve in ſome Rivers, where the Main Stream does not always go in the very ſame place: Sometimes you'll ſee it bear ſtrongly upon one Bank, and within a few Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, quite removed to the oppoſite ſide, or elſe ſettle in the midſt between both. Only 'tis to be obſerved, that whether ſide ſoever it takes to, it commonly makes no very long continuance there.</p>
                     <p>For after the very ſame manner, we frequently ſee ſtrange Alterations in the Motion of the Sap in the Boughs, which are properly its Channel, and where it never conſtantly keeps the ſame courſe it firſt took. One Year it flows in ſo great a quantity into one of the ſmaller Boughs, which was juſt upon bearing, that it quite alters its Diſpoſition, and puts it upon lengthening and enlarging it ſelf; that Matter which otherwiſe would have been Fruit, aſſuming the Nature of, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Wood.</p>
                     <p>The next Year it may happen, that what formerly was employ'd in enlarging the Boughs, now changes its Office, and feeds them chiefly in order to the bearing of Fruit.</p>
                     <p>Another Year you ſhall ſee a Branch, which at firſt look'd as if it would have grown into a Maſſive Bough, begin all on a ſuddain to bear; the Channel through which the Sap paſſed before in a great quantity, being ſome way altered, and thereby the Branch hinder'd from growing any bigger than thoſe of the leſſer ſize.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis further obſervable, that Nature has for each kind of perfect Animals its own peculiar Mould, wherein they are all as it were caſt exactly into the very ſame ſhape, and have ſuch an Air as makes them very nearly reſemble each other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Deſigning and Forming of Fruit-Trees, it neither obſerves Proportion of Parts, nor Equality in Bigneſs, nor Reſemblance in Shape. In perfect Animals, the Eyes and the Ears, the Belly and the Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are always orderly placed in the ſame Parts of the Body: And none of theſe is ever ſuffered to grow in a wrong place, but when ſome frightful Monſter is to be produced: Whereas the Care of Nature is no further concerned about Fruit-Trees, but only that they ſend forth large Boughs, and yield good Fruit, whether it be on the top or below, on one ſide or the other: Nay, it ſeems willing ſo far to comply with the Ingenious Gardiner, as to obſerve his Orders and Conduct in the Management of Trees, ſuffering them to receive what ſhape he ſhall appoint them, and even to produce what Branches and Fruit he will, and where he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince many Productions may be in a Tree at the ſame time, and there is no one Exteriour part of it which is not capable of producing, whereas this Work of Nature is only performed in one certain part of Animals; How unreaſonable is it to argue in all things concerning the Production of Trees, from the Generation of Animals?</p>
                     <p>There is a certain Courſe of Action in the Sap, which very few have the Curioſity nicely to obſerve; and ſome are ſo wholly taken up with Studies of a higher and more delightful Nature, or with Buſineſs of greater Importance, that they cannot ſufficiently apply themſelves to ſuch Obſervations. And though it would be a very
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48210:270"/>
great Accompliſhment in any Perſon that has attained to ſome conſiderable Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in two or three Sciences, if it were poſſible for him to make himſelf as much Maſter of all the reſt; Yet a Man may properly be ſaid to be a Good Aſtronomer, a Geometrician, or Architect, though he be not perfectly well Skill'd in all the other Arts and Sciences. And it would be an unjuſt Cenſure, to ſay, That ſuch a Man is no Good Architect, becauſe he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Good Gardiner. For though an Architects Skill in Building might juſtly be ſuſpected, who ſhould make a Houſe with Smoaking Chimneys, or Rooms that would not hold a Bed; Yet, 'twould be hard to Queſtion the ſame Man's Abilities in Architecture, becauſe the Trees in his Orchard were not all well Ordered, or did not bear abundance of Good and Fair Fruit.</p>
                     <p>And ſpeaking with Reference to a Gardiner, there are a great many Parts of curious Knowledge which he has no Uſe of in his way, and would not in the leaſt contribute to the Advancement of his Skill or Art. As for inſtance, When one knows that the Marble of ſuch a Mountain at <hi>Genoua,</hi> or the Stone of <hi>Carriere de St. Leu</hi> are very good and fine, either to Build with, or to make Statues of; whereas thoſe of other Places are much Courſer, and leſs fit for ſuch Uſes: Pray, Why ſhould a Man break his Brain to find out the Reaſons of the Excellency of the one, the Imperfections of the other, ſince he can neither Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the one, nor make the other laſt for ever? All that is neceſſary in this Caſe, is, To know where to find the beſt, when he ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of it; and where the bad is, that he may not meddle with it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> the Firrs that grow on the South-ſide of a Mountain are much better than thoſe that grow on the North ſide of it. This many of us know upon our own Experience. But I believe a Man would find himſelf mightily miſtaken, if without any regard to the difference of the Earth, he ſhould thence conclude, that the only Reaſon why the latter are Bad, is becauſe they grew up expoſed to the North: For all our Modern Mariners agree, That the beſt Firrs for Maſts come from the moſt Northern Parts of <hi>Norway;</hi> Or if on the contrary, he ſhould lay down this as the only Reaſon why Firrs that ſtand expoſed to the South, are the Beſt; namely, Becauſe nothing elſe but the exceſſive Heat of the Sun can <hi>compreſs</hi> the Parts of that matter wherewith they are Nouriſhed, and conſequently harden and ſtrengthen the Fibers of ſuch Trees more than of thoſe that are not ſo directly expoſed to its Influence: How will this way of Arguing hold concerning ſuch Firrs as are almoſt continually in a Frozen Condition? Pray, Is not Cold as apt to cloſe, and harden, and ſtrengthen any thing as Heat? And is it not as uſual for Rains to come from the South, as from the North? And conſequently are not ſuch things as as lie to the South, as liable to be kept moiſt, as thoſe that lie towards the North?</p>
                     <p>From all which it appears, how unſafe it is, in Treating of Vegetation, to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on General Conſiderations; And that it is much better to examine Particulars; And that not barely with a Deſign to Feed and Gratifie a vain and uſeleſs Curioſity, but eſpecially to diſcover ſomething that may be of real Uſe and Benefit to the Artiſt in the way of his Profeſſion. We ſhall therefore take little or no notice of ſuch Notions, as being but barely probable, are not ſufficient to advance any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Maxime upon; and keep our ſelves from paying too great a defference to the Authority, and being Prepoſſeſſed with all the Opinions of Perſons, who, not contenting themſelves to know, and to be juſtly eſteemed for their Skill in ſome Things, take upon them to lay down Rules in others they do not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Every Body knows that Trees that grow in an open Plain, and in a dry Earth, yield more <hi>Top-Wood</hi> then ſuch as grow in a Foreſt, and in a moiſt Ground. But I believe it matters not much whether ſuch Trees as grow in a Plain be more expoſed to the South, or to the North; Such Poſitions being in ſome Countries not at all taken notice of. And this is evident, particularly in the Vines of <hi>Verſenay,</hi> which are much better when they are expoſed to the North, then to the South, notwithſtanding that <note n="*" place="margin">Auſter vites ſibi objectas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitat, Aquilo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How Neceſſary ſoever the Heat and Influences of the <hi>Sun</hi> may be in themſelves, and how advantageouſly ſoever any Plant may be expoſed to it, yet if it have not the Benefit of a good Earth, as well as the Proſpect of the Mid-day, or Afternoon Sun, we very ſeldom ſee that its Productions are any way Extraordinary. Hence comes that vaſt Difference we ſee in <hi>Vines,</hi> that have all exactly the ſame Poſition towards the Sun: And hence alſo it comes that we have ſo much Marſh Ground that is wholly Uſeleſs, ſo many Plains that are Rich and Fruitful even without Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and ſo many Mountains that produce nothing at all. If the <hi>Pipes</hi> of an <hi>Organ,</hi> or any other Inſtrument, be not good and well made, to what purpoſe is it to put them into the moſt Skillful Muſicians Hand? Are not all Mens Souls of the ſame Immaterial Subſtance, and equally Perfect in themſelves? To what therefore ſhall we aſcribe that Wonderful Difference we find between the Abilities of Wiſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, or Great Philoſophers, and the others who are ſo Dull and Rude, that they are capable neither of Ingenious Arts, nor Common Civility, but to the Difference of their Temper, and of the Organs of their Body?</p>
                     <p>'Tis moſt certain therefore, that the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi> Diſpoſition of the <hi>Earth</hi> is chiefly to be look'd upon as the Principal Cauſe of whatſoever Difference we find in its Productions—And in order to the ſeveral uſes they are to be put to, all that is neceſſary to be here further obſerved, is, That ſuch Trees as grow in large and thick Foreſts are much taller, and their Timber ſtreighter than thoſe that grow in thin <hi>Woods</hi> or <hi>Thickets.</hi>—The Reaſon whereof may be this, That every <hi>Tree</hi> having a kind of Natural Deſire to Enjoy the Benefit of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and as it were Fearing to be ſtifled by the cloſeneſs and over-topping of thoſe next it, endeavours to raiſe its Head ſo high as to reach the free and open Air: And all of them having, if I may ſo call it, this Natural Inſtinct, each endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top the reſt; and ſo all of them grow to a much greater height than thoſe that ſtand alone: And if ſuch a Foreſt happen to be very thick, the Trees growing up too haſtily to an exceſſive height, have not a proportionable Bulk, whereas ſuch as grow up more at liberty, having no ſuch Neceſſity of growing high on a ſudden, make the beſt advantage of their Nouriſhment, grow up leiſurely, and with a thickneſs anſwerable to their height.</p>
                     <p>And this may be ſufficient to ſatisfie our Curioſity, as well as to Direct the Artiſt what ſort of <hi>Trees</hi> may be fit, and which not, for his ſeveral purpoſes in <hi>Building.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall now, in the laſt place, conſider thoſe Superſtitious Obſervations our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Gard'ners</hi> make upon the Influences of the <hi>Moon</hi> in its Wain and Full.</p>
                     <p>I know they will take it ill, that I ſhould look upon that as a piece of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nay as downright Folly, which they pretend to have been the conſtant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Practice of all Times, and in all Parts of the World.—They will tell you that, according to the Opinion of the Ancients, every <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> is in a kind of Wain; and that above all the reſt, <hi>Good Friday</hi> is to be made choice of for Sowing all manner of Seeds; inſomuch that Sowing upon that day ſuch whoſe Fruit you would have to be early Ripe, they will perſwade you that they will be Ripe exactly at the time you expect, ſuch for Inſtance, as <hi>Melons, Cucumbers, Peaſe,</hi> &amp;c.—As alſo that thoſe you would not have to come ſo ſoon to their Maturity, will as exactly Anſwer your Expectation, namely all ſorts of <hi>Pot-Herbs, Coleworts, Lettuces, Ofeilles,</hi> &amp;c. And all this doubtleſs out of a profound Reſpect they bear to the day whereon they were ſet. And that ſuch as are ſet in any other time of the <hi>Moon</hi> do quite fail the <hi>Gard'ners</hi> Expectations.</p>
                     <p>This they will not be convinced to be a groſs Deluſion, as are alſo ſeveral others which they have received by a kind of Tradition from the Ancients, namely ſuch as theſe, That neither <hi>Plants,</hi> nor <hi>Graffs,</hi> nor <hi>Lopped Trees,</hi> will be quick in Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs they be ſet, or cut in the Wain of the <hi>Moon.</hi> And that ſo many days as any of theſe is done after the Full, ſo many years the ſooner will the Trees come to their Perfection in Bearing.</p>
                     <p>And they poſitively Aſſert, That the only Reaſon why ſome Trees are ſo long before they Bear, is becauſe they were either Set, or Cut, or Graffed while the <hi>Moon</hi> was either in the Encreaſe, or at the Full—This they contend for as a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48210:271"/>
matter of Univerſal Experience, and beyond all manner of Diſpute, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that can be ſaid, or ſhewn to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But for my part, I think there is nothing more Ridiculous, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Things themſelves they contend for, or their way of Proving what they Aſſert.</p>
                     <p>As to the Things themſelves, I profeſs that I have for above 30 years, obſerved with all the exactneſs imaginable, whether the ſeveral <hi>Phaſes</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> have ſuch different Influences upon <hi>Gardening,</hi> to the end I might follow an Opinion ſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received, if it ſhould prove true: And that after all, I find that all this is no more than the Old Sayings of ſome Unexperienced and Ignorant <hi>Gard'ners,</hi> who deſigned thereby to cover their own Ignorance, and hoped to be remember'd for ſuch <hi>Jargon</hi> among ſuch as knew nothing at all of Husbandry.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be the Boldeſt, and moſt Inſolent Man in the World, if I ſhould Decry, or go about to Diſprove a Maxim that has obtained for ſo many Ages, and is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by ſo many Perſons ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of its Truth, and ſo Zealous in the Defence of it, if I had not the Authority of a long Experience free from all manner of Prejudice, to confirm what I advance againſt it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, I have plaid the Critick in all the ſeveral Parts of <hi>Gardening;</hi> and laying aſide the Authority of Authors, and Modern Practice, I have expoſed the Errors of the one, and the Faults of the other: All which I have done with no other Deſign but only to Confirm and Improve what I found to be Good, and to Undeceive the World in what upon Experience proved to be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And among theſe latter I may juſtly reckon this Superſtitious Obſervation of the <hi>Moons</hi> Wain; for in what Quarter of the <hi>Moon</hi> ſoever you Set your <hi>Graffs,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you do it well, and at ſuch times of the Year as are proper for ſuch or ſuch <hi>Graffs;</hi> and upon ſuch Trees as Suit with the <hi>Graffs</hi> you ſet upon them, that the Stock be good, and rightly Qualified, that it neither ſend up too much, nor too little <hi>Sap;</hi> and that the <hi>Graff</hi>

                     <p>In like manner, Sow or Set any ſort of <hi>Seeds</hi> or <hi>Plants,</hi> in all the ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and I will promiſe you the ſame Succeſs in all, provided your Earth be good and well prepared; that there be no Fault in your Seeds or Plants, and that the Seaſon be favourable: And that the firſt day of the <hi>Moon</hi> will be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as good for that purpoſe as the laſt.—</p>
                     <p>Having thus conſider'd the thing it ſelf, we may, in the laſt place, look into the Abſurdity of it: For indeed, how it is poſſible that one and the ſame Influence of the <hi>Moon</hi> in one particular Poſition, ſhould at the ſame time affect Plants after ſuch a different manner, and produce in them quite contrary Effects.—'Twould be a rare Secret indeed, if the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhould hold an Intelligence with the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> cauſing ſome of his Plants to Spring up apace, and hindering the Growth of others, juſt as he would have them.—Nothing certainly would be of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the way of <hi>Gardening</hi> than this, if it were True; but ſince nothing is more repugnant either to Reaſon or Experience; and that I hope Men will grow Wiſer than to Trouble themſelves any longer about it, I ſhall ſpare my ſelf the Pains of expoſing it any further.</p>
