            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>I Am a woman poor and blind,</l>
               <l>and little knowledge remains in me;</l>
               <l>Long have I ſought, but fain would I find,</l>
               <l>what herb in my Garden were beſt to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A garden I have which is unknown,</l>
               <l>which God of his goodneſs gave to me,</l>
               <l>I mean my body, where I ſhould have ſown,</l>
               <l>the ſeed of Chriſts true verity.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My ſpirit within me is vered ſore;</l>
               <l>my ſpirit ſtriveth againſt the ſame:</l>
               <l>My ſorrows do encreaſe daily more and more,</l>
               <l>my conſcience ſuffereth moſt bitter pain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I with my ſelf being thus at ſtrife,</l>
               <l>would fain have been at reſt:</l>
               <l>Muſing and ſtudying in mortal life,</l>
               <l>what things I might do to pleaſe God beſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With whole intent and one accord,</l>
               <l>unto a Gardiner that I did know;</l>
               <l>I went and deſired him for the love of the Lord</l>
               <l>true ſeeds in my garden for to ſow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then this proud Gardiner ſeeing me ſo blind,</l>
               <l>he thought on me to work his will,</l>
               <l>And flattered me with words ſo kind,</l>
               <l>to have me continue in blindneſs ſtill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He fed me then with lies and mocks,</l>
               <l>for venial ſins he bad me go:</l>
               <l>To give my money to ſtones and ſtocks,</l>
               <l>which was ſtark lies and nothing ſo.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With ſtinking meat then was I fed,</l>
               <l>for to keep me from my ſalvation:</l>
               <l>I had Trentals of Maſs, and Balls of Lead,</l>
               <l>not one word ſpoke of Chriſts paſſion.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In me was ſown all kind of fained ſeed,</l>
               <l>with Popiſh Ceremonies many a one:</l>
               <l>Maſſes of Requiem, with other juggling deeds</l>
               <l>ſtill Gods ſpirit out of my garden was gone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then was I commanded moſt ſtrictly,</l>
               <l>if of my ſalvation I would be ſure,</l>
               <l>To build ſome Chappel or ſome Chauntry,</l>
               <l>to be pray'd for whilſt the world doth endure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Beware of a new learning (ſaith he) it is lies,</l>
               <l>which is the thing I moſt abhor:</l>
               <l>Meddle not with it in any manner of wiſe,</l>
               <l>but do as your fathers have done before.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>My truſt I did put in the devils works,</l>

               </l>
               <l>thus Chriſt of his merits I did deprave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I might liken my ſelf with a woful heart,</l>
               <l>unto the dumb man in <hi>Luke</hi> the eleven:</l>
               <l>From whence Chriſt cauſed the devil to depart</l>
               <l>but ſhortly after he took the other ſeven.</l>
