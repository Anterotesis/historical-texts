         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

GUIDE
TO
JURIES.</head>
            <p>OF what Date Juries be, is the
same to say, as when was <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
first Inhabited, altogether
uncertain. But that their Antiquity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>England</hi> runs to and beyond the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conquest, among the <hi>Danes,</hi> the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and the <hi>Britains,</hi> is most certain.
<hi>Olaus Magnus, Olaus Wormius, Vertega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Fortesc. Co. Lit.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> conquering the <hi>Britains,</hi>
mixed their Customs with the <hi>Brittish,</hi>
so the <hi>Danes</hi> those <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61804:9"/>
ones with theirs, and the <hi>Normans</hi> all
these with theirs; every Conquerour
making some alteration. Yet this Law
was, and from time to time hath been
preserved and continued an Inheritance
indisputable and Sacred unto us through
all Revolutions, without any Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>None but must acknowledge this of all
others, the best and most effectual way
to find out Truth. There is no other
Way or Art in the whole World, says
<hi>Fortescue,</hi> so remote from all Danger
of Subornation and Corruption, 75.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aaron</hi> had, it's true, in plain Letters
of Gold, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> wrote on
his Breast, signifying what he either had,
or ought have had, <hi>lucem in monte, ac in
voluntate rectitudinem,</hi> Ability in Parts,
and Integrity in Practice. But have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
all other Judges since had such
Parts and Practises? Their Interests,
Ambition, Pleasures, other Passions and
Frailties influenced them too much, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sufficient enough to render them,
as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> c. 33. v. 15. says,
<hi>Idols with Eyes, Ears and Mouths,</hi> viz.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61804:9"/>
               <hi>Such as would neither hear the Peoples
Complaints, regard the Oppressed, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a just Judgment.</hi> Judges have
Places and Preferments so extraordinary
Honourable and Profitable: And what's
their Tenure? Even during Pleasure, a
term for so long as they do nothing but
what and as pleases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do every
thing which and as does please, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And whose Pleasure must it be? Truly
every ones too, that any how has or
can make any Interest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus a short
Syllogism proclaims them little other
than Bond-slaves to such Mens pleasures,
and menaces the People with the worst
of all Miseries, Law-oppression, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
under colour of Law; unless it
be conceivable Mens pleasures were to
have the Judges give Sentence against
them. Judges also were all Lawyers we
know, used just before to take Fees, it's
the more therefore all forget it now.
Judges are concerned in so many Causes,
they are subject to be tempted the oftner,
and every Temptation is the greater,
because they know, if would yield, their
gain might be so often. Judges are so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61804:10"/>
few, it's plain they may the easier be
Corrupted. Judges cann't want Courage,
they think themselves lyable to no Action,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any case, do what they will, but
are absolutely dispunishable, <hi>Co. 12. 24,
25. Hutton.</hi> Whereas a Jury on the
other side, if it err, in many cases it's
lyable to an Attaint, the greatest Funish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they know on this side Death.
A Jury consists of many Persons. Those
which be Jury-men in one Case, yet may
be in few more. They be Men of other
Professions, used never in any Case to take
Fees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are not prejudiced with
fear of losing their Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to further manifest the difference
of Tryal by Judges, and of this by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Jury-men all are, and must be <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri
&amp;c. legales homines: Liberi</hi> free of,

People, and those of good Repute,
no Body's bound to take notice of it,
<hi>Mir.</hi> 200. They must be such Persons
as are named and returned at the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sheriff or Coroner. They must
be every one Sworn every several Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and that in and by a particular Oath.
If any of the Grand Jury be as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
any wise amiss, what they do is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61804:11"/>
quashed and made void on bare motion
to the Court. If any of the Petty-Jury
happen so, Party by Challenging of
them, as appear to be Sworn, either sets
aside the <hi>Pannel, viz.</hi> all of them, or may
any of them, by taking Exception to
the Poll, <hi>viz.</hi> to them severally, as the
Case falls out; and peremptorily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shewing any Cause, may Challenge
and set aside as many as will, under 36,
in case of High-Treason or Misprision of
High-Treason; or under 21, in case of
any Felony. And shewing any such
Cause as aforesaid, as many as will, in
any Case whatsoever, <hi>Co. L.</hi> 156. Now
they are such Elect and Choice Men,
because of the great Trust reposed in
them: And must be Equals, that the
Defendant may the better speak to, and
expostulate with, or reflect upon them,
if do amiss. And that they may not
be over awed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by's being greater
than them; (whereas <hi>Magna stupem, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periora
perstringunt.</hi> Greater things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and astonish us, and things above
us dazle our Eyes.) Nor be careless
or perfunctory for his being much less
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61804:11"/>
than them, <hi>(Inferiora ut exigua &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
contemnimus.</hi> We are apt to slight
things beneath us, as small and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
or inconsiderable.) And must be
of the Neighbourhood, that coming from
nigh where the Question arises, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
in all probability, may have the
better knowledge of them, to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
or to approve of them; and such
may also the more likely know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
themselves of the Party, of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of the Credit of the Witnesses, and
all Circumstances. <hi>Lex intendit vicinus
vicini facta sciat. Co. L.</hi> 78. Thus if the
Place happen disputable, whence the Jury
shall come, they shall come from whence
the matter is like best to be known,
21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. Besides, in this way of or
by Jury, where Life or Member is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
or in any danger, and in all
other Criminal Causes, is required two
Tryals of the Party before he can be
said Guilty, or any Judgment can be
given against him: and the Party must
also be found to be Guilty on both these
Tryals, else all is nothing. The Grand
Jury must first Examine the matter, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61804:12"/>
the Petty-Jury after Examine all again,
to prevent and secure against all Surprizes
of the Party, and Mistakes or Errors in the
Jury. It seems as if very Anciently the
number on a Jury was indefinite, but it
was all the Persons present, come as
would come, <hi>Brit. N. Bacon, &amp;c.</hi> Like
as of Old it was here of those we now call
the House of Commons: <hi>Concil. Brit.
350. Ingulph.</hi> &amp;c. And in the Tryals
at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Vox Populi</hi> was the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
(except in Case of a Senator, which
indeed was Tryed by his Peers, other
Senators.) Hence probably it was, that
all Courts were at first to be open, and
so accessible. Likewise <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. and
some other Texts of the Old Testament,
seems as if the Tryal amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>
were so: But in Analogy of late it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the number of twelve, like as
the Prophets were twelve, to foretell
the Truth, the Apostles twelve to preach
the Truth; the Discoverers twelve, sent
into <hi>Canaan</hi> to seek and report the
Truth; and the Stones twelve, that the
Heavenly <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is Built on: And
as the Judges were twelve anciently to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61804:12"/>
Try and Determine matters of Law,
and always when there is any wageing
Law, there must be twelve to Swear in
it; and also as for matters of State,
there were formerly 12 Councellors of
State. And any thing now which any
Jury can be said to do, must have the
joint consent of twelve, <hi>West. 2. c.</hi> 13.
Else it's in construction of Law, not the
doing of the Jury, but of Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and void. <hi>Mir. 42. 200. 41. Ass.
11. 6 H. 4. 2. 21 E. 3. 31. 29 E. 3.
43. Finch.</hi> 58. The Grand Jury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of more Persons commonly than
twelve, but as aforesaid twelve agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it's enough, and so many of them
must. So that by the Law of Juries
24 Men in all, first and last, find one
Guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Judgement can
be given, or one can be punished for
the Fault one's accused of. And besides,
every Man of the latter Jury, even all
the whole twelve, must all and every of
them agree, and be of that one and only
Mind; (much to suspect, unless one be
certainly and plainly Guilty. It's more
for all twelve, than for twenty nine out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61804:13"/>
of thirty to agree) Any of the Grand
Jury giving in a Presentment or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without eleven more of the same
Mind, and agreeing with him, ought to
be Imprisoned, 40. <hi>Ass.</hi> 10. which also
for any one of the Petty-Jury to do,
none will deny but to be worse. A
Judge was Hanged for giving Judgment
on the Verdict of eleven Jury-men, <hi>Mir.
296.</hi> But on the other side, the Judges
are not so many at a Tryal scarce ever,
the major part of them agreeing, it's
enough; their Tryal would be but one,
or once only; they are never sworn at
the Tryal, nor ever at all, but only once,
and that exceeding generally; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
any of them be excepted against,
or Challenged, (though Anciently might,
<hi>Lamb. Mir. Bract. Flota)</hi> be they never
so great strangers, professed Enemies,
and otherwise ill qualified; and though
the King be Party, yet chooses them
himself against one.</p>
            <p>Besides, if Judges had Power of both
determining the matter of Fact, and also
the matter of Law, as must, if were
no Juries, their Latitude of Erring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61804:13"/>
must then be the greater, and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrong or mischief might be the more,
in as much as might wrong one then in
both the Fact and Law; and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
so to do, would be Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
since then it must be harder to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them, as whether erred in the Fact,
or in the Law, or partly in both; like
as it's easier seeking a Bush than a Wood:
And as it's said, <hi>Occasio facit furem:</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
makes many a Whore. But
were Judges presumed Saints, and never
so upright, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet who can imagine
but at a Tryal, when Witnesses are all
Examined, and Evidence all given, the
Jury being so many Persons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
knowing something of the matter
before, they may all assisting one another
better observe, remember, and judge
upon the whole matter, than any one
or two, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others, though called Judges?
Certainly one may do more with help
than without. So the Proverb is, <hi>Ne
Hercules quidem contra duos; oculi plus
oculo vident:</hi> Two to one is odds at
Foot-Ball: And, <hi>Non omnes sed pauci de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi
aut decipere possunt,</hi> The fewer may the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61804:14"/>
more easily deceive, or be deceived
<hi>Quandoque bonus dormit at Homerus. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
sine Crimine vivit. Humanum est er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare.</hi>
It's natural for Man to err. None's
without fault, and the surest Foot may
slip.</p>
            <p>Visc. St. <hi>Albans, Aph.</hi> 8. says, That's
the best Law, which leaves the least to
the Arbitrariness of a Judge; and <hi>Bract.
119.</hi> says, Judges represent the King's
Person, they are his Officers, and Act in
his stead, (and hence concludes) they

of Life or Member, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Where the
King's Party) for, says he, the King is
thus Judge as it were in his own Cause.</p>
            <p>Thus appears what is the Difference
of Judges and Juries, and something of
the Reason why the Parliament has all
along been so Zealous for Tryals by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as no fewer than 58 several times
since the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
and confirmed the Tryal by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
no one Priviledge else nigh so often
remembred in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now, for the Power and Authority of
<hi>Juries,</hi> and how the Wisdom of the Law
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61804:14"/>
hath entrusted and enabled them in this
Tryal. The Law says, in Tryals, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Complaints as made, or any
matter as alledged be true or not, the
Judges ought not, nor can say, nor have
any thing at all to do therewith, but the
Jury only. <hi>Ad questionem facti non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent
Iudices.</hi> All the whole, or most
they can do, or at least ought, is only
after and upon what the Jury, or the
Parties themselves agree first to be true.
What the Jury does, is called <hi>Verdictum,
Veridictum,</hi> the declaring of what is the
Truth in the Matter. What the Judges
do, is called <hi>Judicium, Juris dictum,</hi> the
telling only of what is the Law. Thus
it is, that every finding of the Jury as
their Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be positive, what
the Fact and Party's intent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was,
and not saying only what their Evidence
is, that it was; for the Judges can't even
so far meddle with, or take Conusance
of the matter of Fact, as but to say, then
the Fact, Case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is so and so, if you
agree, your Evidence to be so and so,
and accordingly give Judgement. <hi>Co. 9.

As <hi>A.</hi> delivers <hi>B.</hi> Goods, and after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them again of <hi>B.</hi> but he refuses
to deliver them again; if <hi>A.</hi> sues <hi>B.</hi> for
finding these Goods, and converting them
to his own Use; the Judges will tell the
Jury, since <hi>B.</hi> refuses to re-deliver them,
this is Evidence enough to find him Guilty
of converting them to his own Use, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and is in Law a Conversion. But if the
Jury gave their Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> specially,
as that <hi>A.</hi> delivered <hi>B.</hi> the Goods, and
after re-demanded them, but <hi>B.</hi> refused
the delivering of them back, without say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
positively <hi>B.</hi> converted them to his
own Use, or not saying generally, we
find for the Plaintiff, which is <hi>tantamount,</hi>
the Judges cann't say and judge <hi>B.</hi> Guilty,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but must discharge him. So where
in a Tryal, fraud is pretended by one
Party done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the other, the Judges
will tell the Jury, such and such parts
of the Evidence prove the Fraud, or in
construction of Law are Fraud. But if
the Jury give their Verdict specially, that
such and such things are true, (which
the Judges said prove the Fraud) and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61804:15"/>
not saying positively there was Fraud,
the Judges cann't say or judge Fraud, nor
take the least notice of any thing as such.
In the case of <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ao. 1 E.</hi> 3. it was adjudged there,
28 <hi>E. 3. n.</hi> 10. that the matters he was
accused of, though were notorious, and
known to them all in Parliament, and all
People else, yet they could not give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon this, nor any time ought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
on any knowledge of their own. One
Condemned of Trespass in the Common-Pleas,
the Judges seeing him in Court,
and knowing him never so well, yet it
was adjudged, if he deny himself to be
the same Person, they cann't say he is,
and so cause him apprehended; because
they cann't judge of any thing, nor take
notice, but only of what is upon Record
before them, 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 55. Thus if <hi>A.</hi>
be Indicted of steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
five shillings,<note place="margin">In <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time, 1 <hi>s.</hi> was as much as 40 now, and before then, more; yet the Law was then, one must steal above the value of 1 <hi>s.</hi> to be Gullty of Felony: So that Merciful Juries now value by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient shilling, and save many, not Guilty of above the value of 40 <hi>s.</hi> present Money.</note> the
Jury may give a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
that he is Guilty
of stealing the five
shillings, but only to
the value of ten pence;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61804:16"/>
and the Judges here
cann't say, the five
shillings were more
worth or less, though
never so apparent.
King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth
asking Judge <hi>Gascoyn,</hi> what if he saw
<hi>A.</hi> kill <hi>B.</hi> and the Jury will find not
that <hi>A.</hi> killed <hi>B.</hi> but that <hi>C.</hi> did? He
answered, I can only Reprieve <hi>C,</hi> and
then intercede with your Majesty for
his Pardon. <hi>Pl.</hi> 83. The Infamous
<hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> proceeding to judge
as Judges, of matters upon Information
by Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwise than by
Juries; this was one indelible blot in
their Escutcheon, though had an Act of
Parliament, 11 <hi>H. 7. c.</hi> 3. to warrant
them in so doing: <hi>Ander.</hi> l. 1. 156.
When a Prisoner is Arraigned, he says,
he puts himself on God and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
(neither of which are the Judges)
for his Tryal; which Countrey is the
Jury. So it is manifest, Juries have the
sole Power and Conusance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, as whether a thing be true
or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Judges have at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61804:16"/>
most only to do with matters of Law.</p>
            <p>Jury men have also the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Law, but with this difference
from that of Fact, that it's necessary they
determine the matter of Fact. But they
may either refuse to meddle with any
thing of Law, and leave it to the Judges,
or at their Election, may take upon them
knowledge of the Law, and determine
both Fact and Law themselves. <hi>Lit.</hi>
§. 368. and so is every days Experience,
whereof see more anon, speaking of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Verdicts, and special Verdicts.
Only if a Jury give a Verdict, setting
forth specially or particularly how the
matter was, and then draw an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
as to the matter of Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the Judges will judge against, and
so make the Judgment of the Jury in the
matter of Law void, <hi>Hob.</hi> 53. As suppose
<hi>A.</hi> be Indicted of Murdering <hi>B.</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi>
of <hi>Feb. &amp;c.</hi> And the Jury give their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
that <hi>A.</hi> gave the Wound at <hi>C.</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi>
of <hi>Feb.</hi> and that <hi>B.</hi> died at <hi>D.</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> of
<hi>Feb.</hi> And conclude, that <hi>A.</hi> murdered <hi>B.</hi> at
<hi>C.</hi> or on the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> Now the Law
saying the Murder was on, and at the place
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61804:17"/>
and time, when and where the Party died,
the Judges will judge against the Judgment
of the Jury, <hi>Co.</hi> 4. 42. So <hi>Anno</hi> 1654. in
<hi>B. R.</hi> between the Protector and <hi>Somner,</hi>
the Court said, the Jury had concluded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their premises, finding he killed
two Men on the Road, but calling it Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter,
<hi>se defendendo,</hi> and so the Judges
ordered him to be Tryed again.</p>
            <p>Thus we see, Judges are unessential
and needless in a Tryal by Jury, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to assist it, by answering and
informing what the Law is, where diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
arise, or at least the Primitive
Constitution might be thus. Like as also
yet they be in the House of Lords, or when
any Tryal is by the Lords, but Assistants
only, when consulted, and no Parties of
or at the Tryal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or as it is, and
always has been in Courts Barons, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Courts, Courts of Ancient Demesne,
and County Courts, 6 <hi>E. 4. 3. Crompt.</hi>
232, 233. and where the Sheriff is made
Judge, though by the King's Writ, <hi>&amp;c.
Co.</hi> 6. 11, 12. The very form of special
Verdicts to this day, looks as if it were
so. As in Murder, the Jury find and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61804:17"/>
give their Verdict (first) how, and in
what manner particularly the Fact was
committed, and then say, but whether
upon the whole matter aforesaid, the
killing aforesaid of <hi>J. S.</hi> be Murder, (in
construction of Law) the Jury is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and therefore ask the Advice of
the Court; and (further saying,) if upon
the whole matter aforesaid, it seem to
the Judges and Court, that it is Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then <hi>the Jury</hi> on their Oath, <hi>say,
the said I. N. is Guilty</hi> in manner and
form as by the Indictment against him
is supposed. And if upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it seem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it is not Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then, <hi>&amp;c. I. N.</hi> is not Guilty in
manner, <hi>&amp;c. Co.</hi> 9. 64. So all the Judges
do is but Advice, though in matter of
Law; and it's the Jury only that judges
one Guilty or not Guilty of Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and whether it be Murder, or what one
is Guilty of, by the Advice and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
only of the Judges, without their
being any wise any Parties of or in giving
such Judgment. And the Reason, and only
Reason, why it ever seems otherwise, may
rise hence, that the Judges of <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61804:18"/>
keep the said inferiour Courts to their
due Bounds, Methods, and Order. And
the Lords keep the Judges to theirs, when
amongst them; but there's no Body does in
<hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi> The like is hinted by the
<hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Marlb. c.</hi> 26. which says, <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>non adjudicetur coram Iustitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijs,</hi>
Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall not be adjudged in
the presence of the Judges: Shewing the
Judgment always to be in the presence of,
not by the Judges. The Ancient Books call
Jury-men Judges, as <hi>Mir.</hi> 209. And it's
not for nothing, the Law is so tender of
them: He that strikes one of them, it's
perpetual Imprisonment, and forfeiture of
the offending Hand, <hi>Judg.</hi> 174.</p>
            <p>It perhaps may be pardonable in
Councellors, because for their Fees, and not
pretending Authority: But why Judges,
though apt to Indulge, Improve, and
Extend their own Power and Jursdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should offer to brow-beat, threaten,
order, impose upon, or wheedle, flatter,
tempt, insinuate with, or any wise lead,
perswade, direct, incline or dispose Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
how to find their Verdict, unless
only directing them so far as Juries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61804:18"/>
of them, it's hard to say. People
daily Rob, and so have done, on <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi>
but it's ne'er the more Lawful.
Thus are Judges Trumpets, and Juries
the Eccho, let who will blow. Thus
are Juries but an empty Name: Thus is
turned topsy-turvy all the whole thing
of Juries. Thus might the Judges draw,
and ingross to themselves the whole Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Tryal, and be in Effect Judges
and Juries too. Thus is the Tryal by Juries
a colour, a sham, and really no Tryal at
all by Jury. Were this allowable by
Law, we should never have had any;
the having them would thus be only an
unnecessary trouble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas, <hi>Lex
nunquam per plura quod possit per pauciora.</hi>
The Law never sets up or requires any
thing so vain or fruitless.</p>
            <p>But some will say, the Jury can do
nothing, but on the Evidence given in
Court, which the Judges hear as well as
the Jury, and so may see the Truth, and
know how the Verdict ought to be, as
well as the Jury, and consequently they
may Instruct, Assist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Jury. It's
true, they may be helpful, they may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61804:19"/>
assist, but however, it's no matter for
their being as aforesaid, too Officious.
And besides, as aforesaid, that the Jury
is Neighbours of the Fact, of the Party,
of the Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Judges
strangers; and the Jury be more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the Judges fewer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Jury also is not bound up to the Evidence
only given in Court, or that the Judges
hear, but may go upon their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
knowledge. Suppose <hi>A.</hi> sues <hi>B.</hi> on
a Bond forteen pounds, and <hi>B.</hi> pleads
payment, but at Tryal proves nothing:
The Judges themselves say to the Jury,
you must find for <hi>A.</hi> unless know the
Money paid your selves: Which shews,
the Jury may find for <hi>B.</hi> if they know
the Money paid, though the Judges knew
nothing of it, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 29. So <hi>Hob.</hi> So
if one be Arraigned, and no Witness
produced against him, the Court says
the like; as was seen this <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
Term, 81. in <hi>B. R. Bradley</hi>'s Case, and
by daily practice. They use their own
knowledge besides, and often against the
the Evidence in Court, <hi>Cr. El. 616.
Groves</hi> and <hi>Short</hi>'s Case. So in <hi>Plowd.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61804:19"/>
410, 411. So a great Case adjudged in
<hi>B. R. Hill.</hi> 21 C. 1. And another there,
22 C. 1. And so says <hi>Stanf.</hi> If a Jury know
any thing of themselves, it's as much as
by Evidence, 130. So <hi>Plowden</hi> says, a
Petty-Jury is sometimes bound to give
their Verdict, though have no Evidence,
<hi>f.</hi> 12. Hence in all Cases at Common
Law, one Witness is accepted of as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
and doubtless any Verdict is good,
though in such Cases, without any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
given in Court, because the Jury
is presumed to know somewhat of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Whereas in all other Countries
in the World, where Juries be not used,
and here when the Tryal is without a Jury,
there must be at least two, as hereafter
shall be said more at large. Thus in any
Attaint brought against a Jury, more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may be given on that side the Jury
passed of or for, or in behalf of the Jury,
than was given before, <hi>Dy.</hi> 53. b. which
could not be, if their own knowledge
were not Evidence, as well as that given
in Court. <hi>Styles</hi> says, 23 <hi>C.</hi> 1. in <hi>B. R.</hi>
it was adjudged, that the Grand Jury
are not bound to find an Indictment,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61804:20"/>
though have Evidence, since they may
know something of themselves to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance
it. So is <hi>Plowden,</hi> A Jury may
sometimes go against their Evidence given
in Court, 8. b And one may read, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were Anciently punished for going
though according to the Witnesses, if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
false ones, <hi>Mir.</hi> 48. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to a Grand Jury is seldom heard
by the Judges, which yet could not be,
if none were Evidence but what given in
Court. Likewise, a Jury knowing of a
Record, Statute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may give their
Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to <hi>it,</hi> though
never given in Evidence. <hi>Moor</hi> says,
a Jury-man delivered his Companions a
certain Paper concerning the Question
out of Court, yet the Verdict was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
good, <hi>Case</hi> 656. Besides, if it
happen they have no other Evidence
but what the Judges know as well as
they, yet they ought by, and according
to the true purport and meaning of their
Oaths, to proceed on it in their own
sense, and as they apprehend or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it themselves, and no otherwise,
though the Judges differ with them;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61804:20"/>
else how can they discharge their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?
And it often falls out, they may
differ. No two Lawyers, nay, Judges,
reading or hearing the very same Case,
but presently make different Inferences,
Deductions, Collections, Conclusions and
Arguments, yea, the same Person at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
times; like as the Philosophers
hold our Senses and Sentiments as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
as Physiognomies. And why should
<hi>A.</hi> impose his Opinion on <hi>B.</hi> rather than
<hi>B.</hi> on <hi>A?</hi> So of Judges and Juries. One
cann't see by another's Eyes. And this
is certain, every thing any Jury does,
as a Jury, is on Oath, and they swear
to be true by Vertue of the Oath at first
administred them; therefore if any of them
happen to joyn in a Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the
rest, against <hi>his</hi> Opinion, or not throughly
satisfied in their <hi>own</hi> private judgment, such
a Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though never so true and
good in it self, yet makes the Party or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as aforesaid, not satisfied, certainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn,
at least <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> as to their
Conscience: For Perjury is not only a Lye
confirmed by Oath, but likewise either
when any one being deceived, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61804:21"/>
that to be true which is not, rashly,
or unadvisedly swears it to be true. Or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when any one thinking a thing not true,
swears it is true, though indeed it be true,
<hi>Flet. 334. Bract.</hi> 288, 289, 292. and all the
Casuists. So is seen in <hi>Palmer</hi>'s Reports.
One was Indicted and Punished for swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing so and so, because he did not
know it to be true as he swore. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole, one may see a Judge ought
not to meddle at all with the Jury: If
he differ not with them, it's needless and
troublesome; if he differ, they are not
to mind him; take it which way one will.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it will be urged, that this
must be understood only as to trying
matter of Fact, and that however, as
to matter of Law, the Jury ought always
to be advised and governed by the Judges
though not as to matter of Fact: No
no further than a mannerly deference that
is payable to the Judges, as more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Laws. For if the Judges say,
or any Witness swear the Law to be
so and so, no Jury is by Law bound
or any wise obliged beyond their own
Reason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at least to believe them in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61804:21"/>
it, 9 <hi>H. 6. 38. Finch</hi> 58. If an Attaint
be brought against a Jury, it's no Excuse,
that the Verdict is according to the Judges
Directions, <hi>Cro. El.</hi> 309. 18.</p>
            <p>Now says a timerous Ignorant Juror,
Oh! but whether the Law be thus or
not, the Judges will Punish the Jury if
comply not with them. This sure would
be pretty! A Jury, perhaps, forsworn,
and lyable to an Attaint, if do comply,
and yet punishable if do not: No, no,
the Law (which is nothing but improved
and refined Reason) was never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to suffer this. <hi>A.</hi> levyed a
Fine of Lands to <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> paid <hi>A,</hi> the
purchase-money: But after <hi>A.</hi> said, he
was then at levying the Fine under Age
of One and Twenty Years old, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fine was void. The Law says
here, the Judges shall determine by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Party, whether he were of
full Age or not, and the Jury shall not,
(the true Reason being, that if the Party
seem of full Age, though he be not, he
shall not avoid the Fine, to prevent cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas, if the Jury were to
try it, they must not go according to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61804:22"/>
seeming, but real true Age, and so if he
want but a Day of One and Twenty
Years, he must thus be adjudged under
Age, as much as if he wanted Twenty
Years, and <hi>B.</hi> should be cheated.) This
Fine was after reversed by King's Bench,
because <hi>A.</hi> did appear, and was also
proved by four Witnesses to be under
Age: But the Validity of the Fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after to be disputed in Common Pleas,
on a Tryal by Jury, though the Court
here told the Jury, that notwithstanding
some Witnesses prove to you <hi>A.</hi> was of
full Age at levying the Fine, yet you
ought not to heed them, for the Judges
have the sole and only power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
whether of full Age or not, and
the Judges of the King's Bench have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
determined it; nevertheless, the
Jury being somewhat extraordinary, and
not so very leadable Men, gave their
Verdict contrary to the Direction of the
Court, and as if <hi>A.</hi> were then of full
Age: And an Attaint being after brought
against the <hi>Jury,</hi> the <hi>Jury</hi> was acquitted
and commended, <hi>Dy. 201. &amp;</hi> 301. And
the <hi>Jury</hi> is the more justifiable in it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61804:22"/>
since the Judges first altered the Law,
in trying by Witnesses, and not only
by Inspection, as <hi>Juries</hi> also do, which
in Tryals by Witnesses are, as aforesaid,
the more competent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a memorable Case of <hi>Bushel,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by Lord Chief Justice <hi>Vaughan,</hi>
where <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Penne,</hi> two Quakers,
were Indicted at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> for their
Meetings; and the <hi>Jury,</hi> whereof <hi>Bushel</hi>
was the Fore-man, would not find them
Guilty: The Court, mighty angry, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and Committed the <hi>Jury,</hi> alledging
for cause, that they (the <hi>Jurors)</hi> against
the Law of the Realm, against full and
manifest Evidence, and against the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Court in matter of Law,
to them in Court openly given and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
had acquitted the said <hi>Meade</hi> and
<hi>Penne:</hi> But upon long and serious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
it was after adjudged, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment,
Fining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was unlawful, and
accordingly the Jury were discharged,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Another time also a Jury-man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
with all the rest, and that no less
than two days, the Judges asked him
what he would do? Says he, rather
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61804:23"/>
starve and dye in Prison than consent;
the Court fined and committed him; But
on better Consideration, discharged him
without more ado: All the Court can
do, being only to (carry them in Carts, if
in the Circuit; along with them, and)
keep them without Meat, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
till will agree, 41 <hi>Ass.</hi> 11. says <hi>Mir. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's</hi>
ought not to be threatned, but to
be free, differing in Opinion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 273.
And it was resolved in Parliament, <hi>Anno
1677.</hi> That the Presidents and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Fining, <hi>&amp;c. Juries,</hi> in or for giving
their Verdicts, are Illegal. And <hi>Keeling,</hi>
Chief Justice of <hi>B. R.</hi> was called to Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Parliament for such Practises.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Lit. f.</hi> 369. says, If any
Labour a <hi>Jury,</hi> Instruct them, or put
them in fear, or the like, it's Punishable,
as Maintenance or Embracery, either at
King's Suit, or at Parties; and perhaps,
it would puzzle one to shew, why a Judge
is not within this Law; for how can
he be said to do this as a Judge, when
to do so is no part of his Office? And why
should any usage alter the Case here,
any more than in other Cases of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61804:23"/>
the Laws; it's much too, any Judge
should offer such a thing, considering he
that judges without a <hi>Jury,</hi> certainly
judges without Authority: And he that
judges with a <hi>Jury,</hi> but governed or
led by him, judges only by colour of
a <hi>Jury,</hi> and by colour of Authority,
and thus makes himself forsworn in and
by the Oath taken at his being Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Judge, makes the <hi>Jury</hi> all forsworn,
violates the greatest Priviledge of the
Subject, infringes the most often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
Law of the Kingdom, and also
does particularly the Party offended the
greatest Wrong imaginable, in as much
as by colour of Law, and makes all the
<hi>Jury</hi> accessaries to the whole.</p>
            <p>Hence it's improbable any Judge should
offer the contrary: But however, a <hi>Jury</hi> in
any Indictment, Presentment, or Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ought, and may give their Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
according to their own Conscience, without
any fear of Punishment one way or other.</p>
            <p>And in any other Case, as where the
King is no Party, but an Attaint hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to lye, they may be punished no
other way. Also no Punishment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61804:24"/>
lyes for or against a <hi>Jury,</hi> which
consists of above Twelve Men, 14. <hi>H. 7.
13.</hi> Nor does Attaint ever lye where the
Witnesses are not on Oath, or for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against what any such Witness says;
nor in any Appeal of Maim, Murther,
or Felony, <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 107. Nor in other
Appeals, as <hi>Regist. 122. Attaint.</hi> 59, 62.
&amp; 22 <hi>Ass.</hi> 82. say. Nor does ever any
Action lye against any <hi>Jury</hi> for going
against their Evidence: And where an
Attaint is brought, it must be Tryed by
a <hi>Jury</hi> of Twenty four Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The only Cases the Judges have any
Power over</hi> Juries <hi>in, are, where in their
Behaviours they become guilty of any
such thing as the Judges may justly call
an unlawful Contempt,</hi> 4 E. 4. 27. 36

the Justices of the Peace of every

an Enquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enquire of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments
of other Enquests taken afore
them, and afore others, of such Matters
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61804:24"/>
and Offences as are to be inquired and
presented afore Justices of Peace, whereof
complaint shall be made by Bill or Bills,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if any such Concealment be
found of any Enquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had or made
within one year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Justices may
Amerce or Fine them at Discretion.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>H. 7. c. 1. viz.</hi> as much as is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
for such Offence, as is said in
a like Case by Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> 10. 140. and
in <hi>Dalton, p.</hi> 541, 23. If any refuse to
be on a <hi>Jury,</hi> not offering sufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
he is Finable, 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 12. So if
any of either <hi>Jury</hi> give a Verdict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as aforesaid, twelve not agreed. So the

Now something more how, and what it
ought to do. The Oath it self, but that
it's so general, would else be Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well as Obligation sufficient. The
Oath of a</hi> Grand Jury-man <hi>is,</hi> I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
enquire, and true Presentment make,
of all such things and matters as shall be
given me in Charge, or shall come to my
knowledge concerning this present Service.
The King's Council, my own and my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
I well and will truly keep secret. I
will Present nothing for Malice, Lucre,
or Evil Will: Nor will I leave any thing
unpresented for Love, Favour, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Reward, or any hopes thereof: But
in all things that shall concern this present
Service, I will present the Truth, the whole
Truth, and nothing else but the Truth.
So help me God. <hi>The Oath of the</hi> Petty-Iury
<hi>is,</hi> I will well and truly-Try, and
true Deliverance make, between our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord the King, and the Prisoner at
the Bar, according to my Evidence. So
help me God. <hi>That of the</hi> Grand-Iury
<hi>was part of it Anciently,</hi> Quod neminem
accusare velint innocentem, <hi>To accuse no
Person innocent,</hi> Ll. Ethelred. <hi>And</hi> pour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61804:25"/>
rien ne levray que je verite ne diray. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall hinder me from speaking the
Truth,</hi> Brit. 12. 135. Crompt. 304.</p>
            <p>The Scripture teaches one his Duty
upon an Oath: It says, <hi>One must swear
in Truth, in Justice, and Judgment, Jer.
c. 4. Deut. c. 16. Exod. c. 20. Dan. c. 5.
Levit. c. 14. Zech. c. 13. Acts c.</hi> 5. and
the <hi>Proverbs</hi> in several places. <hi>In Truth,</hi>
with one's Eyes, neither in a Telescope
or Microscope; not proceeding by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
or seemingness of things, not
by adding nor diminishing, not by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating
or palliating, not by Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or Reservation, not by Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Accepting the matter otherwise
than really and truly it is, not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doubtful, or not
certainly true, as true; nor omitting any
thing certainly true, but always as the
naked Truth is, so and so. In <hi>Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
not at a venture, as by casting Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
not as matter of Form, not rashly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorily,
or negligently passing or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
over things, not by implicite Faith,
or in complemental Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not
upon trust or belief, further than with,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61804:26"/>
and upon good and great Deliberation,
Considerateness, Reasoning, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
according to ones own Conscience,
and because one's mature and settled Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is so and so. In <hi>Justice,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fairly, impartially, with Integrity,
and according to the Merits of the Cause,
without charging one with Murder that's
Guilty but of Man slaughter; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Malice, Fear, Hope, Pity, Favour,
Affection, Passion, Corruption, or other
Prejudice, Byas, Consideration, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or sinister End or Design: But all
throughout purely, because is so and so
more than otherwise. And consonant to
Scripture, as well as generally in all other
things, so also in this are even Morals
and Politicks. The Wise Men (so call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
of <hi>Greece,</hi> were called so from their
living Prudently, Justly, and Honestly,
such also are they <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls so, 1 <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph.</hi>
&amp;c. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, He's the
Wise Man that sticks to Truth, <hi>Neque
quicquam fingit,</hi> and abhors and banishes
every thing else, not so much as admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of any Stories, Fictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
<hi>Machiavel</hi> says, <hi>Judex cujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61804:26"/>
gratiae nec potentiae cedet, neque mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordia
nec invidia nec odio comovebitur
sed vere semper &amp; incorrupte ex legibus
judicabit.</hi> Judges must not be moved for
the Power of any one, nor for any ones
sake, one way or other, nor with Pity or
ill Will, but always go according to
Law, truly and without Byas. <hi>Justinian</hi>
speaking of Judges, says, <hi>Eorum est ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
puras Deo, Imperatori &amp; Legi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stare.</hi>
They must be inoffensive to God,
the King, and the Law. <hi>Non illum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli
fasces, non purpura regum flectunt,</hi>
No Acclamations of the People, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the King, neither of these move
them. <hi>Contra rempublicam, nec contra
jus jurandum amici causa, vir bonus non
faciet.</hi> Against the common good or an
Oath, no Man will stir an Inch, if
honest, though it be for a Friend's
sake. <hi>Judex ponit personam amici cum,
Iudicis induit.</hi> Judge <hi>Hales</hi> is a Friend,
as <hi>Hales,</hi> but none as a Judge. <hi>Si om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
facienda sint quae amici velint non
amicitiae tales sed conjurationes putandae
sunt. Cicero.</hi> What a Judge does at the
Request of his Friend, is really and truly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61804:27"/>
no Friendship, but is making himself
and Friend guilty both of a Crime. The
<hi>Areopagites</hi> (were Judges that) heard
Causes only in the dark, that they might
take Notice what was said, and not who
spoke. And what is said of Judges by
these Authors, must by us in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
be applyed to <hi>Juries.</hi> The Book
whereon Swearing one layes one's hand;
is God's Everlasting Truth, and most
Holy Word; so that if one forswears
one's self, one virtually in so doing ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forsakes God, and his Mercy and
Truth. Says a Learned Man, part of the
Oath is, <hi>So help me God, viz.</hi> I pray
God he will never help me, if I shall
not sincerely and faithfully keep this my
Oath. <hi>Cajetanus</hi> says, 2 <hi>Qu.</hi> 98. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
is of it's Nature a Contempt of
God. And as the Proverb says, <hi>Malum
est ludore cum Sanctis:</hi> It's however ill
jesting with edg'd Tools.</p>
            <p>By the Oath of the <hi>Grand-Iury,</hi> one's
bound to observe as well the Charge
which shall be given by the Court, as
the Form of the Oath it self. But this
it's plain must be understood, so far as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61804:27"/>
the Charge is according to Law, and
not contrary or repugnant to the Oath
it self, and no further or otherwise.</p>
            <p>Anciently the Charge was given in
Writing to the <hi>Jurors, Brit. 9. Bract.
l. 3. c. 1. Dalton p.</hi> That the <hi>Jury</hi>
might easier remember it, their Minds
be refreshed, and perhaps, themselves
Edified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> does, is by
way either of Presentment or Indictment.
<hi>By Presentment,</hi> when they know of a
a Crime or Fault themselves, and give
a short Note of the Parties Name, place
of Abode, and Fault, without Form, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it to the Court to put into Form.
<hi>By Indictment,</hi> when the Party and Fault
are ready brought them in Parchment,
drawn up in Form: And indeed, the
most true difference is only, that the
one is in Form, and the other not.</p>
            <p>In an Indictment, first they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and understand it well and throughly:
And if they cann't understand it, ask the
Assistance of the Court, either to give
them a Clerk on Oath to <hi>English</hi> it for
them, or otherwise as need shall require.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61804:28"/>
Then they must consider, if the Fault, as
alledged, with the Circumstances and Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations;
amount to, and be a real
Fault or not, and also worth complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of; for <hi>De minimis non curat Lex.</hi>
The Law minds not every little thing,
and this is daily experienced in Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Ac. of Case. If it be no
Fault, or one not worth complaining of,
which in Law, as aforesaid, is all one,
they reject the Bill, and meddle no more
with it. If they find it a Fault, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
as aforesaid, then they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if know it true so of themselves;
which if they do, or other Evidence sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them it is, they Indorse, or write
on the Back side of it, <hi>Billa vera,</hi> this
Bill is true: But if they do not know
it themselves, nor be satisfied by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then instead of <hi>Billa vera,</hi> they
write <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> We know not: And
afterwards thus deliver all the Indictments
into Court.</p>
            <p>The Clerks of Court, to get Fees, and
perhaps, some others for one sinister end
or other, will be apt to say, that the
<hi>Grand-Iury</hi> ought to find an Indictment,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61804:28"/>
or make a Presentment against any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Offence or Offender, though have
but colour of Evidence, or a probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the thing being true, and that
what they do is but matter of Course,
a Ceremony; matter of Form, barely
an Accusation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that this is not
so indeed, is apparent, for what end then
is a <hi>Grand-Iury?</hi> Only for show. The
Law would certainly then have never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
one to be at all. We see they
are obliged to be Sworn, and they are
as much on their Oath as any other
<hi>Jury,</hi> which then should be the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The very form of their Oath teaches
us better. The Oath is, <hi>Diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</hi>
&amp;c. not <hi>negligently,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>True
Presentment make,</hi> not <hi>probable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for lucre,</hi> &amp;c. not excepting the
Clerks, <hi>&amp;c. According to Evidence,</hi>
not <hi>Presumption: The whole Truth, and
nothing else but the Truth,</hi> which how
can be at such a rate as the Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
speak of?</p>
            <p>But then they Object, that these words,
<hi>According to the best of one's Knowledge;</hi>
are added. If they be, it's against Law,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61804:29"/>
               <hi>Mir. 304. Brit.</hi> 12. 135. And altering
an Oath, is imposing a new one, which
cannot be without an Act of Parliament,
<hi>Inst.</hi> 2. 479, 658, 719. But however,
May <hi>Jurors</hi> in such case wink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
they may not know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These words
are <hi>best of,</hi> &amp;c. and not <hi>worst;</hi> they are
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> not <hi>Ignorance;</hi> they imply
the <hi>best</hi> one <hi>can</hi> know or find out: And
not only what one already <hi>does</hi> know,
for then what need the word <hi>best?</hi> And
besides, they relate to the word <hi>enquire,</hi>
as well as any other word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the
more one considers them, the less one
shall find they really alter the Oath.</p>
            <p>Then, say they, all a <hi>Grand-Iury</hi> does,
is but presenting in form, and not in
form as aforesaid, and is only supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
as it were, and nothing positive or
certain, grounding themselves only on
this, that the Form of the Indictment
is, <hi>The Jury upon their Oath Present,</hi>
instead of <hi>The Jury upon their Oath say;</hi>
and so infer, that if any thing in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
or Indictment be false, yet it's
no Perjury. Alas, to see Men in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
what hold they'll catch at! Could
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61804:29"/>
               <hi>Argus</hi> himself have seen this Exception?
No, unless blind. <hi>Present</hi> and <hi>say</hi> are
undoubtedly here, and in such like cases, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mous 
Terms. To <hi>Present</hi> on Oath, is to
give the Court to understand on Oath: And
to <hi>say</hi> on Oath, is to tell the Court on Oath;
and an infinite of Indictments be <hi>say</hi> instead
of <hi>present, Rast. 263. Kitch. 100. Co.</hi>
9. 114. And <hi>Fleta</hi> goes so far, as calls
an Indictment a Verdict, <hi>f.</hi> 113. The
words also of the Oath be, <hi>to truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
and not <hi>say.</hi> And Lord <hi>Coke</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
calls the <hi>Grand Jury-men</hi> all wilfully
Forsworn and Perjured, if wrongfully
find an Indictment, <hi>Inst.</hi> 3. 33.</p>
            <p>Then, say they, but Indorsing <hi>Billa
vera,</hi> as aforesaid, implies not that the
<hi>Jury</hi> takes upon them to know, or say,
the Bill, or the Contents, are true; but
<hi>vera</hi> there signifies probable, or fit for
Enquiry. But then, why not another
word used more properly and usually
<hi>Latin</hi> for such a sence than, and instead
of <hi>vera?</hi> And what is <hi>Latin</hi> for true,
if it be not? And is not true, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
accepted <hi>English</hi> word of, and for
<hi>vera?</hi> And is not <hi>Billa vera</hi> the Answer
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61804:30"/>
made to their Oath, that they shall true
Presentment make? This is like the
rest.</p>
            <p>Then, say they, this is no Tryal, but
in Order to bring to Tryal, and the
Party is at no prejudice if the Bill be
found. It's true, it's no determinative
Tryal that finally concludes either Party,
because it's but one of two, which every
one accused of a Crime must have as
aforesaid. But it's so much a Tryal, as
Learned <hi>Fleta, f.</hi> 113. looks upon it no
less one than any other. The form of
their Indictment is the same of that of
a Verdict. All things are, or ought to
be alike in the whole Proceedings, and
to differ nothing, but the one to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other, and the latter to be final,
the other not. The <hi>Stat.</hi> of 23 <hi>H. 8.
c.</hi> 23. Enacts, One shall be Indicted of
High Treason in what County the King
pleases. And the <hi>Stat. 1, 2 P. M. c.</hi> 10.
says, That Tryals for Treason, shall be
according to Common Law: This Act
repeals the other, though speaks only of
Tryals, and the other of Indictments,
<hi>Anders. (1.) 104, 105. Inst.</hi> 3. 27.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61804:30"/>
which shews an Indictment is a Tryal.
One of the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> cann't be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
on the other: And why? says
the Law, for he has once already found
the Party Guilty, and if should not again,
he must Perjure himself, <hi>Brit. 12. 25 E. 3.
c. 3. 7 E. 4. 4. Stanf.</hi> 158. It puts
the Defendant to Disgrace, Trouble,
Damage, Danger of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It makes
him lyable to an Out-lawry, to Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to every thing but
very Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the final Judgment it
self. It gains Credit, and gives Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to auother <hi>Jury</hi> to find one Guilty.
It produces this Effect, that if the other
<hi>Jury</hi> find one guilty never so wrongfully,
no Attaint lies against them, nor other
Punishment: And what's the Reason?
The Law says, because he is found Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not by these other twelve only, but
in all, by Twenty four or more, this
latter and the other <hi>Jury</hi> too, <hi>Attaint.

him, whereas he that brings one against
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61804:31"/>
any one that was never Indicted of the
same Offence, may be liable to great
Punishment, if wrongfully brought, <hi>Stanf.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61804:31"/>
it: So that upon the whole, if a Peer
have but seven Peers among all the rest
that bear him ill will, or either any ill
wisher, that can make him so many of
them his Enemies, he must Dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
fall back, fall edge. And to help the
matter, he shall always be sure of the
ablest Council in the Kingdom, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the Cause against him.</p>
            <p>Suppose one should ask any Honest
Man this Question: Were he not on
his Oath, yet would he find an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
of Course, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to expose one,
and put him to such Inconveniences, as
aforesaid? Certainly, says he, No. And
the Monster that would, does it wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
because is not certain he does o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
And being on his Oath, as
aforesaid, it's not only doing wrong,
but tainting himself Crimson red in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
too; sure a Malicious way of doing
wrong. It's doing wrong also by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Law and pretended Authority,
the greatest Mischief and Injustice, says
the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> of all other, <hi>Inst.</hi> 2. 48.
The damage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too in all these Cases
is the greater yet, that the Party can
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61804:32"/>
very scarcely, if at all, expect any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
or Amends: Whereas in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cases he may easily. For against
the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> or any of them, no
Action lyes, in as much as doing what
they do on their Oaths, the Law will
not presume, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
them. And though one be Indicted at
the Instance, or upon the Endeavours of
some other Person, (all the <hi>Jury,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
being sworn to Secrecy) can one
easily discover, and prove who this Person
is, what he did, and prove it at a Tryal?
Which yet one must do fully, if expect
any thing but making bad worse. And
might one recover damage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it's
damage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be put to the Trouble
and Hazard of the Recovery. Well
therefore, says <hi>Fleta, f. 52. Valde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarium

says, no less Care or Concern at all lies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61804:32"/>
on the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> than does on the
<hi>Petty Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law, (to see its Nature, how
it inclines generally, that one may the
better guess in this matter) it is not with
us like those of <hi>Draco:</hi> It's as tender
of the Lives, Liberties, and Credits of
the People, (none can deny in all cases
else) as a Mother of her Child, and why
then not in this also? It will presume
nothing dishonest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any one, or
any time, but it will, and always does
presume all Persons and Things Honest,
True, Innocent, &amp;c. till the contrary be
proved, <hi>Co. L. 78. b</hi> As <hi>Ovid</hi> says, <hi>Sit
piger ad poenas princeps ad praemia velox.</hi>
So <hi>Lamb. Sax.</hi> Laws cry often Clemency
and Forgiveness as well as Justice. And
<hi>Lex Angliae Lex misericordiae est,</hi> Says
<hi>Coke, Inst.</hi> 2. 315. Like the Laws of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whence it was first derived, which
shews Mercy is not opposite to, but part
of Justice, 1 <hi>John 1. 9. Psal. 71. 1, 2.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61804:33"/>
leans that way which is the milder. One
brings an Appeal, if the Jury be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the Defendant shall be acquit, and
the Appellour imprisoned, <hi>Fleta 52. Mir.</hi>
224, 273. So a Jury being doubtful if
one were a Villain or not, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
free, <hi>Fleta 238. Bene tibi praecipiunt</hi>
(says <hi>Cicero) qui vetant quidpiam agere
quod dubites aequum sit vel iniquum; aequitas
enim lucet ipsa per se, dubitatio autem cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem
significat injuriae.</hi> They do well,
that forbid, one doing a thing when du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious,
whether right or wrong; for where
it's right, the thing is necessarily as clear
as the Sun: But any doubt speaks the
thing not to be so. As if a Physitian
give one Physick, he must give one that
he is sure will do one good, or no harm,
and not what he doubts may do one
harm. It's also plain, if I doubt, I must
not say, I am certain, (as <hi>Billa vera)</hi>
but I know not certainly, (as <hi>Ignoramus)</hi>
else I tell a Lye. It's very remarkable
too about all Indictments, the <hi>Jury</hi> only
says, either <hi>it's true,</hi> or <hi>we know not,</hi>
and never that <hi>it is not true;</hi> which shews,
if they be doubtful, or not fully satisfied,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61804:33"/>
the Indictments must be Endorsed not
<hi>Billa vera,</hi> we know it is true, but <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus,</hi>
we do no not know it is true.
And the Law does not put it upon the
<hi>Grand Jury,</hi> to say the Bill is not true,
if they do not find it, though does put
it upon them to say positively, the Bill
is true, if they find it, and so encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
the finding Indictments <hi>Ignoramus.

Oracle of our Laws, <hi>Co. L.</hi> 115, 391,
45, 94, 113. has it, That whatever was
Law, is yet, unless altered by Act of
Parliament, which this never was. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the other side, if a <hi>Grand Jury</hi>
do not find the Bill against any one,
there can be no harm then to any Body;
but another Indictment may some other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61804:35"/>
time be brought, when there's better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or a worse Jury. For though
one's Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall come but once in

it may yet a Thousand times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Grand-Iury,</hi> for they never say
the Party is not Guilty, but at most say
<hi>Ignoramus,</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Any thing any Jury does, ought be <hi>Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Evangelium,</hi> like what they laid their
Hands on, taking their Oath. When
they write <hi>Billa vera</hi> on an Indictment,
they undeniably compare the Truth of
the Contents therein, to the Truth of
the Gospel, and this upon Oath. Thus
one would admire how it comes to pass,
that they of the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hear but one side: Their Oath, it's
apparent, is against this: It says, <hi>Present
the whole Truth,</hi> not concealing or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any part of it; which implies as
well all one side can inform them as the
other. And so appears by less strong
Cases far, an Attaint lies against a Jury
(swearing to well and truly Try the
issue between the Parties) when every
word of the Verdict may yet be true,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61804:35"/>
only it not being the whole Truth. As
if one having had common appendant
time out of Mind, bring an Assize of
the Common, making his Title that he
hath had common time out of Mind,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (without speaking of the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency)
and so the Jury find for him:
For thus he should else have Common
in gross, when his Right or Title is
not to <hi>such,</hi> but to Common Appendant,
<hi>F N B. 107. a. 10 E. 4. 17. 49 H. 6.
17.</hi> So one having had a Rent in Fee, as
Forrester of such a Forrest, time out of
Mind; in an Assize for it, makes Title,
by saying he had a Rent out of that
Land, time out of Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
saying as Forrester, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and the
Jury find for him, for he hath not had
the Rent by Prescription, as must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Claim and Verdict, as
aforesaid, <hi>ibid. b. Co.</hi> 5. 78, 79. So
that it is not enough for a Jury to say
the Truth, but the whole Truth, though
too no such Word as this of whole
Truth, be mentioned in the Oath. It
proceeds, and says, <hi>And nothing else
but the Truth,</hi> which how can possibly,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61804:36"/>
or any <hi>Jury-man</hi> be satisfied in, unless
hear both Parties? It says, <hi>You shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
Enquire,</hi> &amp;c. not by halves, or
but hearing one side only. It's a Maxime,
<hi>Qui statuit aliquid parte inauditâ alterâ
aequum licet statuerit haud aequus fuerit.</hi>
He that judges or determines any thing,
when but one side only is heard, does
unjustly: And the Judgment, or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
though in self be never so just
or right, yet shall he no wise be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Just Judge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it not a common
Saying, <hi>One Tale is good, while another
is told?</hi> One at this rate might be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for a Cut-purse, when but an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Glover; so might Chyrurgions, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
Bayliffs, Jaylors, Hang-men, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for but doing what belongs
to their several and respective Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the matter may be managed, and
yet saying nothing but Truth neither,
only not the whole Truth. Is there not
in all Determinations else, the Hearer
and <hi>Defendant,</hi> as well as <hi>Complainant?</hi>
Thus erred <hi>Judah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
in judging <hi>Thamar</hi> to be Burnt, upon
Report, when she was unheard, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61804:36"/>
24, 25, 26. So was <hi>Joseph</hi> faisly accused
of Lying with his Mistress, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Prison, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 19, 20. So was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth</hi>
falsly accused by <hi>Ziba,</hi> and
deprived of all he had, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. Which
being all Presidents, and Damned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
must, or shall any one be so hardy
as to embrace and follow them now?
Either one's Guilty or not; if be, let him
yet have fair play for his Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If
not, why should he then be Indicted? So
that, why should he not be heard?
Else one's Condemned first, and Heard
after; or indeed Hanged first, and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after, or little less. The true intent
of the Law herein seems, as if Men
were to be handled not thus, but that
the Defendant should be heard at first,
and if he then could give satisfaction,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> he might be at no further trouble,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if he could not, that he should
have such trouble, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and having No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thus, might prepare himself the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so not be surprized at the final
and concluding Tryal, or have any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Pretence that he was surpriz'd,
or any wise unprepared at this final Tryal.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61804:37"/>
This method being most Honourable for
the King and the Law, and also most
safe for the People. And the Reason
why it was ever otherwise, seems bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Result of some Artifice of the Clerks,
to get themselves Money, imposing on
the <hi>Juries;</hi> or from this, that Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being made without the Party
heard, therefore the <hi>Jury</hi> thought they
might find an Indictment likewise. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
they ought always to distinguish; for
a Presentment is on their own knowledge,
when they know all the whole matter,
even what the Defendant can say for
himself; but an Indictment is found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Witnesses, which tell their Tale to
a hairs breadth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as makes the most
for the side they are produced of. And
at length after some few Presidents, it
has now grown into Practice: <hi>Dato
uno absurdo mille sequuntur:</hi> All can be
pretended why it should be so now,
is but Practice and President. And when
it's against Justice, against Truth, against
any ones Judgment, sure one ought
rather to Correct than Approve of, or
follow such Practice or President. At
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61804:37"/>
least wise a <hi>Grand Jury</hi> ought hear both
Parties, if present, or easily, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
to be heard.</p>
            <p>It would likewise amaze one, to see
how the Clerks, for their Gain, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for other Ends, have often prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Jurors to find a Bill true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
when in all the Circumstances of Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation,
or most of them, false, if not
in the Fact it self; and those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
too altering the very Fact, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
about as much as white Feathers
would a black Crow.</p>
            <p>Considering how true Presentments,
Indictments, and Verdicts ought to be,
and that the whole Truth, and nothing
but the Truth must, or may be in them:
That the <hi>Jury</hi> undertake the Bill is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
true, not only as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in general, but even in
every particular, all the Circumstances,
Aggravations, and every individual word,
(for if it be not true in the least word,
it's not true, but false, and Perjury.)
<hi>Stanf.</hi> says well, <hi>f. 96. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> De faire bon
Enditement est requisite a conustre &amp;
d' aprendre que sera dit Treason. ou Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61804:38"/>
ou non:</hi> To perform the Duty of
one on the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> it's necessary
to learn and know what's called Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
what Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what not:
Hence also one learns, one must not in
an Indictment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> call, or suffer called
Felony, Treason; Man-slaughter, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
nor one Crime by the Name of
another: Or mention, or suffer mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
words spoke, or things done, other
or after another manner than really or
truly were said or done; and therefore
the Judges give the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> to this
day their Charge so distinguishing, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and directive of all, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the several Crimes, their Natures,
and how to call them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Clerks draw an Indictment,
Information, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they'll not only alledge
and insert in it the very Fact, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one
is accused of, but craftily, and full of
Art, stuff and load it, into the Bargain,
with several fictitious and fleight Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of their own, to swell up, and
aggravate the matter; as Circumstances
of Malice, or Design, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Party,
when did the Fact, spoke the words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61804:38"/>
So that sometimes from a Mouse, a
Mountain; from nothing, or what's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
it will in such a Dress shew
and strut like a Giant, a Monster, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And all this, forsooth, they'll call mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Form, and then endeavour to
perswade a Jury, if they find the chief
matter, or that part which they'll call
the matter of Substance, true, they must
of course find all the rest, which <hi>they</hi> please
to call matter of Form, true also. This
usual way of wording Indictments is so
notorious, dangerous, hurtful and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
that it several times, and in all
Ages, has been complained of by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whatsoever, except the Clerks and
Prosecutors themselves, whilst Clerks and
Prosecutors. It has been a Complaint
in and of Parliament, by King, Lords,
and Commons; See 4 <hi>H. 4. c. 2. 37 H. 8.
c.</hi> 8. This is that whereof may be said,
as was in <hi>Courtin Hertsey</hi>'s Case, <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
creare ex nihilo malum, Diabolicum
est.</hi> It's the part of the Devil himself
to make a small fault be, or seem a great
one. But no Complaint, no Argument will,
or can prevail with a Covetous Clerk,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61804:39"/>
getting Fees, or a Malicious Prosecutor,
troubling whom he has Envy or Malice
against, to desist their Advantage. And
as the true Circumstances of any Crime
do always, or mostly aggravate or alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
it, and all those suggested thus by
the Clerk, if the Bill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be found by
the Jury, (though pretended only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Form) become thus as true, and
the Judges must adjudge a Punishment
accordingly, as if all were really true:
Thus is a Trap set to catch the Jury
and Defendant; the Jury to Perjure
themselves, and wrong the Defendant,
and the Defendant to be adjudged of
a Crime, when perhaps guilty of none,
or at least of a worse Crime than tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is. A Jury therefore, ought first
consider, as aforesaid, if the matter of
Substance, or chief matter, be Criminal at
all; and if be, then if considerable: And
if be not Criminal, or considerably Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in it self; then if the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as alledged, make it so; and if not,
then to reject it. If it be considerably
Criminal, with or without the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
then consider if you know it of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61804:39"/>
your selves, or by Evidence be satisfied
it is true, both it self and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
If the matter it self be not
true you reject the Bill; (for where's
no Body, is certainly no Shadow:) If
the matter be true, but the difficulty be
about the Circumstances, then consider
if they be material; if not, you find the
Bill; if be, then consider if they be
consistent, or the matter will bear them;
if not, then reject the Bill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or at
least strike them out of the Bill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If
be, then consider if they be true on your
own knowledge, or by the Evidence giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
you; if be, then find the Bill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if not, they must be struck out, or the
Bill return'd <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> &amp;c. As for
Example, The <hi>matter</hi> must be <hi>Criminal
and Considerable:</hi> This partly appears
before; but further, Suppose the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
of <hi>A.</hi> get a Woman with Child,
and secretly run away upon it, and <hi>A.</hi>
procure a Warrant to Apprehend him
for it: But <hi>B.</hi> a Stranger knowing of
the Warrant, Lodges, Comforts, and
Assists the Apprentice in unknown places,
that the Warrant cann't be served; the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61804:40"/>
Stranger is not punishable, 15 <hi>Jac. B. R.
Vaughan</hi>'s <hi>c.</hi> If a Commission be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to two, and one of them execute it
alone, without the other, and accordingly
Fine People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet no Indictment
lies, for it was an Error of Judgment,
27 <hi>Ass.</hi> 23. If one say to a Justice of
Peace, Executing his Office at his House,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not on the Bench, certain scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

yet he may not be Indicted for
it, <hi>Hides c. Trin. 11. C. 1. B. R.</hi> And
so was Sir—<hi>Sackfield</hi>'s <hi>c.</hi> these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all inconsiderable Faults. And as to
whether <hi>the Circumstances,</hi> or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Principal, <hi>be material or not:</hi>
Those words or parts be only words of
Form, and but those only which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
implyed, as that if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
or the rest, be true, these must be
so too, and cann't possibly be otherwise,
and thus become needless to be proved,
being before proved, as and by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
consequence of the other Proof;
so he that proves a Shadow, proves also
a Body, since there must be a Body to
cause it; and those words be material
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61804:40"/>
which may cause a different Judgment
or Punishment, or that aggravate the
Fault, make it greater, of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or any wise alter it, and therefore
are not to be presumed, but must be
proved. The Jury must observe also
<hi>whether consistent,</hi> as an Indictment of
or for Felony, saying, that one such a
Day Feloniously cut down such Trees,
and carried them away; or with Force
and Arms such a dav cut down such and
such Trees, and Feloniously carried
them away; this is inconsistent, for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
can never be about standing Trees,
<hi>Indict.</hi> 4. So of growing Apples, of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or any thing fixed to the Free-hold:
But all it can amount to, is only Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
unless the falling appear by the
Indictment to be one time, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away, another. So if a Mad-man,
a Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have no Discretion,
be said to do things maliciously, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
any thing, this is inconsistent, or
impossible, in as much as no Malice or
Design can be in such. <hi>If necessarily
implyed, for if be not, they must be proved,</hi>
&amp;c. Every Jury must go by <hi>Probata,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61804:41"/>
what's proved, as well as <hi>Allegata,</hi> what
is only alledged. Where one's Accused
of knowingly keeping a Dog wont to
worry Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the knowledge must
be proved as well as the rest, <hi>Cockrain</hi>
and <hi>Davies c. B. R. 17 C.</hi> 1. So the
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> when sued Lord <hi>Digby,</hi>
for maliciously speaking such and such
words, he proved the malice as well as
words. If one pleads a Feoffment by
Deed, and the other denies it, it must
be proved to be by Deed, <hi>Co. L. 281, <hi rend="sup">b</hi>
               </hi>
So if one be Indicted of Murder, as that
he with Malice, Fore-thought, killed
such a one, the Malice fore thought
must be proved; for in these Cases the
killing might be either by chance, as
the Glance of an Arrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Physick, by a Champion in Tryal
by Battel, by a Hang-man doing his
Office, or by one <hi>non Compos mentis,</hi>
&amp;c. In which Cases is no Malice, and
and therefore the Indictment not to be
found: So the Words might be spoke
in Jest, or a Thousand other ways,
and not maliciously. So one might keep
such a Dog, and not know he was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61804:41"/>
such, and the Fault would then be none
at all in him. The Law also may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times be broke in the Letter, yet
without any Fault, if the Intent of the
Law be not broke: As when things are
done to avoid a greater Inconveniency,
or by Compulsion, or for Necessity, or
by involuntary Ignorance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in
these and such like Cases, the Party
ought not be Indicted, though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be true in it self. The <hi>Romans</hi> had
a Law, <hi>He should dye that climbs over
the Wall in the Night;</hi> yet one doing
so to discover their Enemies, was by
the Senate adjudged Innocent, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
So it's Lawful with us, to
pull down another's House when a Fire
happens, or in Time of War, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a greater Mischief. So one being
to appear to a Writ, but hindred by
Floods, Sickness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> does not, he is
Excused. One forces and uses one's
hand to kill a third Person, he is only
Guilty: So an Infant, or one <hi>non sanae
memoriae,</hi> kills another, it's excusable.
So that where any Fact or Words in
an Indictment might be as well under
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61804:42"/>
any of these Circumstances, as what
other the Clerk or Prosecutor is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to alledge, these alledged must be
proved, for it's plain, are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
implyed. And yet if a Man
should do any wise thus, the Clerks
will draw up the Indictment or Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as if none of these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were in the Case, but that it was
Maliciously, in contempt of the Laws,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it seems hard a Man should
be Hanged for stealing under a Necessity,
where the taking is upon absolute Necessity
indeed, and it's not the Parties Fault,
but Misfortune, he fell into such Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And especially if the Party whom
the taking is from, have not the like
necessity for the same thing, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that takes, be very Serviceable or
Profitable to the Kingdom or Common
Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he must be, though the
thing so taken be not of the Value of
13 <hi>d.</hi> if the Jury agree he did it Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously;
whereas one Guilty of Perjury,
though does one a Hundred thousand
times more harm, shall only suffer an
inconsiderable Rebuke. And why should
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61804:42"/>
a Jury in this Case find it done Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously,
this was done under Force and
Necessity, to preserve a Man's Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
instead of an House, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what's said
Felonious, must be, <hi>Felleo animo,</hi> with
an ill affected Mind, with a Mind not
barely to do the thing, but an itching
also to do Mischief; (only this itching
indeed shall be presumed, unless Cause
appear to the contrary.) As if one takes
a thing out of another's Possession, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with some colour as his own, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
this is adjudged no Felony: Why? for
not done with any Felonious Intent, as
appears by his claiming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the
like Stealing, as aforesaid, was not for
Mischief sake at all, but for Necessity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus <hi>David,</hi> against the Law, took and
eat that Bread which was provided for
the Table of God only, <hi>Exod. c. 29.
1 Kings</hi> 21. Our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
plucked off, and eat the Ears of
another's Corn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. And he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had need of an Asse, took that
was none of his, but anothers; and had
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> ready to perish, taken <hi>Dives</hi>'s
Crumbs against his Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61804:43"/>
seems he had no more sinned than he
mis-behaves himself, that does what the
Lord bids, and the Steward forbids, under
the Rules aforesaid. A Jury therefore, not
observing the Rules aforesaid, gives a
Verdict not only against the present and
immediate Defendant, but also in him
even against <hi>David, Christ,</hi> &amp;c. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
thus in his Case. In the Civil
Law, (that of the Admiralty particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
if a distressed Ship takes water by
force of another where is Plenty, it's
no Theft; because of the necessity, so
adjudged several times. If an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
mention one Seditiously, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to disturb the Government, and
to withdraw from the King the Love of
his Subjects, and said of him such and such
Words, here the Words might, perhaps,
be spoken within the Priviledge of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in Parliament, or in a Jocular
Way, or Ironically, when one means the
contrary; or by way of Supposition, in
Argument, or when one meant a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thing, or no harm at all; and this
perhaps too explained at the same time
in other words accordingly, or the Words
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61804:43"/>
in the Indictment be but part of the
Sentence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or transposed, or some
how else altered. So if a Complaint be,
that one falsly and maliciously, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
designing to break his Credit, and ruine
his Trade, called such a one a Bankrupt,
here, perhaps, he was a Bankrupt then, or
no Tradesman at all; therefore in these
and such Cases, the Circumstances alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
being not implyed necessarily, though
the Fact or words were spoke, they must
be proved. But to instance some Cases ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
by the Judges themselves: If <hi>A.</hi>
bring an Appeal against <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> is after
acquitted; now, should <hi>B.</hi> Indict <hi>A.</hi> for
maliciously, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bringing the Appeal,
the Indictment ought not be found,
if <hi>B.</hi> were Indicted before of the same
Fault, he was after Appealed against for,
because his being before Indicted proves
there was at least colourable Reason
why the Appeal was brought, and not
Malice only, <hi>Coron. 178. 40 E.</hi> 3. 42.
A Chvrurgion was Indicted, for that he
by Negligence in Curing one's Hand,
maimed it; the Negligence must be
proved, 48 <hi>E. 3. 6. 11 H.</hi> 6. 18. So in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61804:44"/>
Actions for Words, which holds the same
Law as in Indictments, <hi>&amp;c. A.</hi> sues
<hi>B.</hi> for falsly and maliciously calling him,
being an Heir, a Bastard; Action will
not lye, if <hi>B.</hi> pretend himself Heir, for
then it was not maliciously, but only as it
were in order to get or claim the Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And it's Lawful thus to slander another,
justifying one's own Title, <hi>Co.</hi> 4. 10.
So <hi>Molton</hi> sues <hi>Clapham,</hi> for that a Suit
depending between them, upon reading
certain Affidavits in Court, <hi>Clapham</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
then and there, falsly and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
said, there is not a Word true in
the Affidavits, and that he would prove
it by 40 Witnesses; here the Words,
though were agreed false, yet being not
spoke maliciously, but out of other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
as in his Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforesaid,
Action does not lye, <hi>B. R. 14 C. 1.
Rot.</hi> 459. So a Councellor calling one
a Thief at a Tryal, the like; for it's
not malicious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if material for the
Cause he manages, <hi>Montagues c.</hi> So
where <hi>A.</hi> says to his Friend <hi>B.</hi> that <hi>C.</hi>
hath the <hi>French Pox,</hi> therefore advising
him not to keep him Company; for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61804:44"/>
spoke as Advice to a Friend, and not
maliciously, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Rudley</hi>'s <hi>c. 40,
41, El. in B.</hi> And thus is further seen
the Cause or Occasion of speaking words,
or doing any thing, must be considered
as well as the Words or Fact: And
says <hi>Coke, This</hi> is a <hi>General</hi> Rule, <hi>Co. 4.
14.</hi> Also it's another Rule, All Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Fact or Word, ought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to be made the least of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
<hi>Verba accipienda sunt in mitiori
sensu.</hi> Words shall be taken spoke in
that sence which is most innocent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
See of this several Examples, <hi>Co. 4. 17.
Hob. 473. C. 4. 19. Co.</hi> 4. 13. for the
Law will <hi>presume</hi> Innocency further than
down-right proved, as aforesaid, to the
contrary. <q>And if <hi>Juries</hi> should not
be cautious, as aforesaid, one might
be Indicted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for saying <hi>The King
is a fit Man to Govern,</hi> or for any
thing in the World. Suppose <hi>A.</hi> be
Indicted <hi>for maliciously, and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to withdraw the King's Subjects from
their due Allegiance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>saying, The
King is a fit Man to Govern,</hi> and <hi>A.</hi>
should be found Guilty of it, because
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61804:45"/>
he said these words; <hi>A.</hi> would be in
a sad case, the Judges must give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if the Words were spoke
Ironically, or in a contrary Sence than
they were, for <hi>so</hi> the Circumstances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
import, <hi>though be found of
course.</hi>
               </q> If a Jury find an Indictment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Word <hi>felonicè</hi> in it, they
find one Guilty of Felony, be the Fact
what it will, and so as a Felon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
must suffer: So also if the word
<hi>proditoriè,</hi> for High Treason; and why
may not they as justifiably find these
words of course, as other not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
implyed? Where an Indictment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is grounded upon a Statute, then
every little Word must be proved that
is also in the Statute, though seeming
implyed, or little more than immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
this <hi>all agree.</hi> For want of these,
and such like Observations, one <hi>Tho.
Burdett,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> was Condemned, Hanged
and Beheaded at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourth's Time, when the matter proved
was only, that he being absent, the King
hunted in his Park, and killed a white Buck,
which Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi> fancied above the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61804:45"/>
rest of his Deer, and that Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi>
hearing of this, wished the Bucks Horns
in his Belly that Advised the King so
to do, <hi>Speed</hi>'s <hi>Hist.</hi> 700. Much like
was it also with one <hi>Walter Walker,</hi> who
was Beheaded in <hi>Smithfield, Anno</hi> 1476.
when all proved against him, was only,
that he (Living <hi>at the Sign of the Crown</hi>
in <hi>Cheapside, London)</hi> said to his Child,
to pacifie him when he cryed, <hi>Peace,
peace, Child, thou shalt be Heir of the
Crown.</hi> But who can open some <hi>Jury-mens</hi>
Eyes, to see how like an Ox led
to the Slaughter they be imposed upon,
and cheated, to cheat others of their
Lives, Fortunes, and all that's dear to
them; though by their Example too of
Acting thus, they make Presidents, and
give countenance to after Juries to be
like themselves, and consequently expose
and render themselves, they know not
how soon, in the same predicament, and
to be punished as the Criminal was they
punished. <hi>Or by the Evidence given you.</hi> 
               <q>Evidence is only such a Testimony
that makes somewhat relating to the
issue or matter in Question clear, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61804:46"/>
and plain to the <hi>Jury;</hi>
               </q> hence
says <hi>Coke Lit. 283. Probationes debent
esse evidentes &amp; perspicuae.</hi> And thus is
it, all the Witnesses or Testimony in
the World of things impossible, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
inconsistent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can be no more
than <hi>bare Testimony,</hi> and cannot any wise
amount to, or be called <hi>Evidence.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Jury must consider the Credit and
Authority of the Evidence, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or extent of what is Evidenced.
<hi>First,</hi> If the matter proved amount to
such plain and full Proof as is required.
An Indictment laid against three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
may not be found against all three,
when the Evidence is only against one
or two of them; nor if laid against one
Person for three Faults, may it be found
against that one for all the three mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
when but one or two of them are
proved; nor when the Evidence is but
to part of a Matter or Fault, may the
Indictment be found for the whole; but, as
aforesaid, all found must be proved. Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforesaid, brought upon, or
referred to <hi>any Statute,</hi> the words of the
Statute mentioned in such Indictment,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61804:46"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be proved very strictly, even
to a tittle; the Proof must hit the Bird
in the Eye. As one Indicted on the
Statute for <hi>Maliciously disturbing a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
at Divine Service,</hi> every one of
these Words must be proved; so for
<hi>wilfully and corruptly forswearing one's
self;</hi> so <hi>for one's gain keeping a Gaming-House.</hi>
But in other Cases, as <hi>at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law,</hi> if the proof and words in the
Indictment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differ either in the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or the <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,
or so as the difference be not
somewhat considerable or material, as
aforesaid; such is indeed no difference
in Law, nor by the Jury to be taken
as any. In the <hi>matter,</hi> as in a Complaint
for these words, <hi>B. is a maintainer of
Thieves, and a strong Thief himself;</hi> here
the word <hi>strong</hi> signifying little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
need not be proved spoken, <hi>Dy.</hi>
21. 75. But if the Allegation and Proof
materially differ, otherwise; as for these
words, <hi>If</hi> B. <hi>might have his will, he
would kill all the true Subjects in</hi> England,
<hi>and the King too.</hi> Now, the Proof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Defendant said, <hi>I think in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61804:47"/>
my Conscience, that if</hi> B. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the best
Opinions in this Case are, that this is
not sufficient Proof; for the Words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
are more positive and absolute, and
move Credit more in one's Ears than
those proved, and so are not in effect
the same, but materially differ. So of
these Words, <hi>B. procured eight or ten
Witnesses of his Neighbours, to Perjure
themselves;</hi> the Proof being only that
the Defendant said, B. <hi>had caused eight
or ten,</hi> &amp;c. This is no Proof, for one
may be a <hi>Cause,</hi> and yet not a Procurer,
there being remote Causes, <hi>Causa sine
quâ non,</hi> as well as others so nigh, as
that of procuring. Such a Cause as this
<hi>B.</hi> might be, though only Plaintiff or
Defendant in a Suit, for had there been
no Suit, there could be no Perjury. And
the most favourable and innocent Sence
of Words is to be taken, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As for the <hi>manner,</hi> An Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being for Murder <hi>by Poyson;</hi> if the
Proof be, it was <hi>not by Poyson,</hi> but
a Weapon, Burning or Drowning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
this will not do; for the manner prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is of another Nature proved than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61804:47"/>
but if the difference were only
thus, that the Poyson alledged were of
one sort, and that proved of another,
this being immaterial, (both agreeing it
was by Poyson) the Proof may serve.
So Murder alledged to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>by a Dagger,</hi> the proof being it
was <hi>by a Sword</hi> or Bill, may serve; but
proof <hi>by Poysoning</hi> will not do. If an
Assault and Battery be alledged to have
been <hi>at A.</hi> the proof being it was <hi>not
at A.</hi> but <hi>B.</hi> may serve, provided the
Offence be neither greater or lesser, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
committed at <hi>A.</hi> or <hi>B.</hi> But if the
place alledged aggravate the Fault, it's
otherwise; or if both places be not
in the same County. So of the like
difference in time alledged and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Now,</hi> as to the Credit and
Authority of what is Witnessed: <q>It's
no proof or Evidence to a <hi>Jury,</hi> which
is against their own knowledge, nor
any other but that only, which
confirms them in what did know, or
acquaints them with what did not
know.</q> The only Reason, said my
<hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> at Lord <hi>Cornwallis</hi>'s
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61804:48"/>
Tryal, why a Prisoner is allowed no
Councel in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> or in any
thing but matter in <hi>Law,</hi> when <hi>Life</hi> or
<hi>Member</hi> is concerned, is only this, <hi>The
Evidence whereby he shall be Condemned,
ought to be so plain and evident, that
all the Council in the World may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
able to say nothing against it, or
in his Defence.</hi> Nothing ought so much
as raise a suspicion, says <hi>Horne,</hi> but what
comes from <hi>grave and good People,</hi> those
which be <hi>Credible,</hi> and heed what
they say, <hi>Mir.</hi> 200. And not from
others, as ill-tongued, ill disposed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
People, <hi>Bract. Brit. Stanf.</hi> 
               <q>The
great Lord <hi>Coke</hi> says, of old time (as
yet, says he, indeed it ought to be)
Any Indictment was not to be found
but on Credible Witnesses, and plain
and direct Proof; and never upon
Probabilities or Inferences,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Inst.</hi>

many hold, there should be <hi>two</hi> good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
produced to the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61804:48"/>
prove every Indictment: And the Proof,
says <hi>he,</hi> ought to be <hi>more</hi> clear than
<hi>Light.</hi> Every <hi>Jury</hi> must always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
they may presume nothing but <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;</hi>
and <hi>Innocency</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they ought,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the contrary proved. Of Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Argumentative Verdicts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
finding one Guilty, there be several very
sad Examples. One the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> tells
of, is, <hi>There being two Brothers, one dies,
leaving an Estate, and an only Child, the
other Educates it, and one Night correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, it cryed, Good Vnkle do not kill
me, and next morning it was gone no Body
knew whither. This Brother is Accused
of its Death, upon Evidence of the matter
aforesaid, that he beat it, it was Young,
about Nine years old, it cryed as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
it was never heard of since, and
that the Vnkle enjoys an Estate by this.

in all these Cases. Thus if a Jury find
the Words not spoke, or the Fact not done,
with, and according to the Aggravations
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61804:57"/>
and Circumstances in an Indictment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
mentioned: They ought either <hi>not find</hi> the
Indictment, (for one not being Guilty as
the Indictment mentions, is consequently
not Guilty of that Indictment, but rather
seems, if guilty at all, guilty of some other
matter than which he stands Indicted of,
and so of some other Indictment only; and
then let the Prosecutor, if so fond of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
his Neighbours, bring such other)
Or <hi>strike out</hi> what they have not sufficient
Evidence of, as do often in Indictments of
Murder, (which say the Defendant <hi>of his
malice fore-thought Feloniously Killed and
Murdered</hi> such a one) strike out the words
<hi>of his malice fore-thought</hi> and <hi>murdered,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Evidence of the Malice, but suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of the rest, and then endorse it <hi>Billa ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
and so find the Bill <hi>Man-slaughter,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>Murder.</hi> So was it of an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against Ld. <hi>Chandois</hi> and Count <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
his second in a Duel. In like manner,
when the Evidence proves a Fact done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by mischance, defending one's self, in
time and place of War, when Defendant
was <hi>non Compos mentis,</hi> an Officer doing his
Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> alter the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61804:57"/>
accordingly. So of the <hi>Petit Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
only it does not alter the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but instead of altering Murder
to Man-slaughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforesaid, in the
Indictment, they only say, Guilty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter,
and not of Murder; or guilty of
Chance-medley, <hi>Se Defendendo,</hi> &amp;c. Or
they may tell the Court particularly and
plainly how they find the truth in, and of
the whole matter to be so far as concerns
the Fact, or what was done or said. As in
Cases of Words, what were spoke, where,
to what intent, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and so leave it to the
Court to judge on it according to Law, and
to tell what the Law is thereupon, and so be
discharged themselves, which is called giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>special</hi> Verdict. Suppose <hi>A.</hi> bring an
Action of Debt on a Bond against <hi>B.</hi> as Heir
of <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> pleads he hath nothing from
<hi>C.</hi> to pay any thing with; and <hi>A.</hi> replyes,
that he has, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so the Issue is joyned
(or what the Jury be to Try, is) whether <hi>B.</hi>
has any thing, as aforesaid, or not. <hi>A.</hi> proves
that <hi>B.</hi> had before the Action, brought
something so, but aliened by Fraud and ill
Practice, to deceive <hi>A.</hi> of his Debt. Now,
they finding the matter or case to be thus
indeed, and the Law being (for there is a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61804:58"/>
Statute, 13 <hi>El.)</hi> that such aliening shall be
void, and consequent, the Heir chargeable
nevertheless: They may, if will, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
either take upon them to know the
Law, and in this, or any Case, say <hi>generally,</hi>
they find for <hi>A.</hi> Or not take Notice of the
Law, but <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> and so tell the
Court how, and what they find the matter
to be; and thus leave it to the Court to
judge in Law, whether ought to be found
for, and this is their most safe way. To this
end was the <hi>Stat. of West. 2. c.</hi> 3. that if a
Jury doubt on the Evidence what the Law
is, and therefore what to do, they might
leave it to the Judges to determine. But,
says <hi>Coke,</hi> this Statute is only in <hi>affirmance
of the Common Law, Inst. 2. 425. 13 E. 1.
39.</hi> See a <hi>special</hi> Verdict in Case of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Co. 4. 44. Co.</hi> 9. 63. One in an <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
N. B. Entr. 375, 378. Co.</hi> 1. 22.
One in <hi>Attaint, Dy.</hi> 173. So in a Case
about <hi>Murder,</hi> the Jury tell the Court; they
find the Killing itself to be true, but not the
Killing Feloniously, as mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
and so ask the Opinion of the
Court if it be Murder, <hi>Go.</hi> 9. 69. So the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
found the Parties Indicted for <hi>Riotously</hi>
tearing the Petition, Guilty of tearing the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61804:58"/>
but not of the <hi>Riot,</hi> &amp;c. It's true,
it's doubted in <hi>Moor, c.</hi> 1002. whether in
a Writ of Right a Jury may give a special
Verdict. But <hi>as</hi> there is no Reason, that if
the Cause be indifferently plain, as to the
Law, the Jury themselves should not put
an end to it, giving a <hi>General</hi> Verdict, as
Guilty or not Guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without so much
further Charge, loss of Time, increase of
Trouble, as otherwise must needs follow;
yet on the other hand, there is as little why
if there be difficulty in Law upon the case
that they being mostly unlearned in Law
should be bound to find <hi>generally</hi> Guilty or
not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so find and say on a sudden
what is the very Law, as well as Fact, when
some such Cases have several years puzled
all the Judges to resolve. And it's against all
Reason, that the Election of giving a special
Verdict, or general Verdict, should be in the
Judges too; for the Jury best knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their own Capacities and Strength, do
therefore best know when meet with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to them in Law, and so when to give
the one or other: And accordingly are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving by your Friend received
your Treatise concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
with desire that I should
shew it to one, whose course
of Study is so well known to
be Conversant with Ancient Records and
Books, as his Judgment is worthily
Esteemed, I did, after I had read it over,
perform that Trust, by shewing it to that
Learned Gentleman, whose Opinion your
Friend told me was desired; and further by
that Gentleman, it was Communicated to
another Worthy Person of the same Course
of Study; and both of them having read it
over, I from them return it to you, with
Assurance, that they, as well as I, have
had much Satisfaction and Delight, by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so useful Subject Matter so Learnedly
Treated of, in a time, when the Publishing
it seems <hi>not only Seasonable, but Necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish we might have the Happiness to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61804:60"/>
know you, but being assured by your
Friend, that you have taken a Resolution
as yet, to Conceal your Name, we must
for the present, think it enough to believe
that Treatise is composed by a <hi>Worthy,</hi> as
we find it could be done by no other than
a <hi>Learned Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I must, in returning your <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi>
present you some Matters and Cases
which occurred to our Thoughts in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; which being agreeable with yours
on that Subject, yet some of those Cases
and Instances, I am about to mention, not
being so particularly Express'd in your
Book, though two or three Passages which
are in yours, [as concerning all the Twelve
of a <hi>Jury</hi> of Tryal to consent in Verdict;
and in <hi>Grand Juries,</hi> Twelve at the least to
Consent in making Presentments, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments;
and the Matters of <hi>Empson</hi> and
<hi>Dudley.]</hi> I shall herein repeat, because
they will relate to the other Paragraphs
here intended, what may seem not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in yours, are offered to you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
whether you will insert them in some
proper Places among the Leaves, and
Parts of your Book, and reject the rest
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61804:60"/>
that I shall Write in these Papers, unless
you please to receive them all together as
they will be sent to you, by way of Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which yet must want the Ceremonial Form
of Address, whil'st you forbear to let me
know, to whom to direct my Respects.</p>
            <p>What I am about to present to you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to this Matter, are:</p>
            <p>Let any Sober Citizen consider, how
Legal, Just, and Reasonable, he would
think it, if being of clear Reputation,
Credit, and Innocency, he should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for some Base, yet Capital Crime,
upon the Oath of a <hi>strange</hi> or <hi>bad Fellow</hi>'s
Evidence, who should be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> or vehemently
suspected to be a <hi>Rascal,</hi> notwithstanding
which they should (by the Judges Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections)
find the Bill, and thereupon the
Citizen should be publickly arrested by
Officers, haled from his House or Shop,
commited to Prison, his Goods invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and Guards set upon his House
to prevent pretended Imbezlements, and
his Credit and Reputation utterly ruin'd
without Remedy. And after all this, that
it should be said, the <hi>Grand Jury did well
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61804:61"/>
to find the Bill, from whence all these sad
and woful Consequences follow'd,</hi> upon
such late applauded Notions, that the <hi>Grand
Jury</hi> are not to be Judges of the Credibility
of the Evidence; or that tho Citizen is not
in danger of his Life, till his Tryal by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; How much would such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have been abhorred, and declaimed
against, if a Woman, notorious for being
a Common Whore, should have indicted
the late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for a
Rape, and the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> should have
found the Bill, whereupon the Archbishop
was to be committed to Prison, suspended
from Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, his Goods
and Chattels all over <hi>England</hi> inventoried
by the Sheriffs? Would the Plea have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> in the Opinion of
any Unbyassed and Impartial Man, that
though they believed in their Conscience,
that the leud Woman swore false, yet,
they being to find according to her posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Evidence, they, as so many Parish-Clarks
were but to say <hi>Amen</hi> to her
Oath of the Fact; and so find <hi>Billa vera</hi>
against that Eminent Prelate?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61804:61"/>
It may be also considered, whether the
Statute 13 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 1. which requires
that Persons shall be Indicted and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Testimony and Depositions of
<hi>Two Lawful and Credible Witnesses upon
Oath, can be interpreted to make the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Two Witnesses not Credible, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Evidence?</hi> If the Witnesses are to be
Credible, as the Statute plainly declares
they ought to be, then it may be further
ask'd, Who are to be Judges thereof? If
the Judges; Then they take upon them
to determine <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms
Judges both of Law and Fact: And
what need then is there of <hi>Grand Juries?</hi>
But that the Credibility of the Lives, as
well as the Circumstances of the Evidence
of the Witnesses is intirely lest to the <hi>Grand
Iury,</hi> is plain from this; That if one of
the Judges be produced as a Witness, he
must in that respect, for that time, leave
his place as a Judge, and be sworn, and
appear before the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordinary Witness.</p>
            <p>Besides, If the Intire Judgment of the
Evidence had not by the Law been left to
the Jury, then they would be finable if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61804:62"/>
they should refuse to find according to the
direct Swearing of the Witnesses, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true or false, probable or improbable
to them,) and if they should not impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
follow the Pleasure and Direction of
the Judges.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>Jury</hi> is not finable, is adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Case you remember of <hi>Bushel,</hi> in
the Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Reports, by solemn and
seasonable Resolution of the Judges.</p>
            <p>And should not the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the credibility of the Evidence before
them, the <hi>Affidavits</hi> of Two Persons, who
should swear Treasonable Words against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man, would be sufficient to bring him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon the <hi>Jury of Life and Death,</hi>
and then the Trouble of a <hi>Grand Jury</hi>
would seem only a piece of needless For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
which our wise Ancestors never
thought so slightly of before; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Use of them would never have
been continued, nor would Men of so Great
Worth, as they generally are, or should be,
serve therein; where Sheriffs make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their Duty to return such.</p>
            <p>It may not seem Impertinent here, to
mention a Memorial, or Credible Report,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61804:62"/>
of what happened in the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> concerning a <hi>Jury</hi> at a Tryal,
whereof the Substance is; That a Murder
being committed, a Man, who was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for the Fact, was Arraigned before
the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Anderson,</hi> at the
Assizes; the Evidence was so strong, that
the Judge directed the <hi>Jury</hi> to find the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
Guilty; and they going together to
consult of their Verdict, Eleven were for
finding him Guilty, but the Twelfth Man
was against it: This begat great Dispute,
and the Judge expecting a present Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
sent for them, to know the Reason
why they staid so long, he being ready to
rise; the Jury told him, they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
but one, whereupon the Judge aske
him, why he did not agree with his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
to find the Prisoner guilty, seeing
there was so plain and full Evidence? To
this the twelfth Man gave no Answer,
<hi>(where by the way may be noted, that none
of the Jury are bound to declare their Reason
for their Opinion.)</hi> So the Jury was sent
out again; but no Perswasions could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with the twelfth Man to agree with
the rest: Therefore the Jury were to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61804:63"/>
shut up all Night without Meat or Drink,
and in the Morning great were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
from the Eleven, of the Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Health; so that the Judges in
Commiseration sent for them, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with the Twelfth Man, the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was found Not guilty, and so acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
After the Jury had given in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
the Chief Justice desired to speak
with the twelfth Man, and that he should
come to his Lodgings after the Court should
rise: When he came, his Lordship taking
him aside, told him, that the Countrey
look'd on him as an Honest Man, but in
what he had done, he much doubted there
was something extraordinary, and desired
him to tell him what it was: The Juror,
with a disturbed Mind, told him, that if it
might not turn to his Prejudice, he would
discover the whole Business: To which
the Chief Justice replyed, that it should
not, and gave him his Hand upon it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Juror with tears told him, that he
was the Person that had unfortunately kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Man, and that the Prisoner was not
guilty of it; and that this Juror had not
sought to serve in the Jury; and confessed,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61804:63"/>
that after he was sworn, <hi>upon his Lordships
Directions, and the Juries Importunities, he
had once resolved to comply, and find the
Prisoner guilty;</hi> but when he considered,
that was to add Perjury, and another Murder
unto Murder, he resolved to be starved to
Death, rather than to agree thereunto.
When the Chief Justice had heard him out,
you have, saith he, done a very ill thing;
but seeing you have not added one crying
sin to another, Pray God for Pardon, and
I will get you the Queens Pardon.</p>
            <p>Sir, You having mentioned in your
Book, I might omit to say any thing, that
Juries of Tryal every one of the twelve
must agree, or no Verdict can be given,
and no way should be introduced to go to
the Vote, and Poll amongst themselves
for the major part. But I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
mentioning it again, because special
Notice should be taken thereof.</p>
            <p>And also of what you have very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that Grand Juries ought not <hi>to find
any Bill, or make any Present men or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unless twelve of their number agree to
the Presentment or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Rule
of Law being very clear <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61804:64"/>
may appear by the Statute that direct En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
to be by the Oath of twelve Men:
And all the said Statutes prove, and some
of them expresly declare, that Enquiry by
the Oath of twelve Men hath always been
the laudable Custom and Usage of this
Realm: Therefore though Grand Juries
consist of a greater Number, and may put
matters that come before them to the Vote
and Poll, yet the major part of them ought
to be twelve at the least, to agree to any
Bill of Presentment or Indictment; for
there cannot lawfully be any Presentment
or Indictment, unless twelve of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereunto, which I could not forbear
the more expresly to repeat; <hi>It being fit
and necessary for all Gentlemen, and others
who serve in Grand Juries to know,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Mistakes of what is so plainly the Law,
in all Cases of Presentment and Indictment
by <hi>Grand Iuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Juries</hi> are Judges not only of Fact,
but of Law, by your Treatise may more
fully be seen, and may clearly appear by
their Power to give Special Verdicts as
well in Capital as Common Matters, as
in Case of <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dictment of Burglary, they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61804:64"/>
may find only the Felony, and acquit of
the Burglary, and many such like Cases,
as where Indictment for stealing Goods
therein mentioned, of the Value of Ten
Pounds, they may find the same to be but
Ten Pence, and so to be but <hi>Petit Larceny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I hope it will not seem tedious to
shew that <hi>Juries,</hi> as well of <hi>Inquiry</hi> as
<hi>Tryal,</hi> have sometimes been Judges also in
Matters of the Church and Religion, even
in time of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in Cases of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> such ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was the Care and Watchfulness, which
our Law provided against the Danger and
Incroaching Jurisdiction of the <hi>Popes</hi> and
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which have always had
Designs against <hi>England, our Laws and
theirs being incompatible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore from the time of King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>the Third, and the Reigns of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Kings, there have been Laws made,
That</hi> if any of the Kings Subjects obtain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
or Promotion to Benefices, or if any
Appeal from the Kings Courts of Justice to
the Court of. <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. they shall be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
during Life, and forfeit their Lands
and Goods, and be out of the Kings Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61804:65"/>
               <hi>And we know, that the way of Inquiry
and Tryal in these Cases hath always been
by</hi> Juries.</p>
            <p>There are some other Matters compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
within the Construction of the Statute
of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> as the drawing Matters any
where else to another Examination than in
the King's Courts of Law. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Offences made to be under the like
Punishment, and call'd <hi>Praemunire</hi> by other
Statutes, which we need not here mention;
my Intention being only hereby to shew,
that <hi>Juries</hi> have been anciently Judges of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Matters,</hi> even in time of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for their having been Judges of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
also, we may see after King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth had cast off the <hi>Pope</hi>'s usurped
Supremacy, and by the Power of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
restored the Crown and Laws of
<hi>England</hi> in Church Matters, to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Rights and Usage, but had not then
cast off the <hi>Popish Religion;</hi> He, with the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the
Commons in Parliament, in the Thirty first
Year of his Reign, even at the Instigation
of the Clergy. (as is recited in the Record
of that Statute, and in <hi>Rastal</hi>'s Printed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61804:65"/>
Book of Statutes at large, 31 <hi>H. 8. c. 14.)</hi>
Enacted that the Statute (commonly
call'd) of six Articles; whereby,</p>
            <p>1. The Real Presence in the Sacrament
was to be believed.</p>
            <p>2. That the Communion in both kinds
was not necessary.</p>
            <p>3. That Priests ought not to Marry.</p>
            <p>4. That Vows of Single Life are to be
kept.</p>
            <p>5. That Private Masses were agreeable
to God's Word.</p>
            <p>6. That Auricular Confession was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that if any one should Publish, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
Say, Affirm, Argue or Hold any
Opinion against the said Articles, he should
suffer Pains of Death, without Benefit of
Clergy, and forfeit all his Estate, Real
and Personal, and Commissions were to
be directed to the Bishops of the Diocess,
their Chancellors, Commissaries, and other
Persons, as the King should appoint, to
<hi>Inquire by the Oaths of Twelve Men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which Statute, the Learned Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
in his <hi>History of Reformation,</hi> Folio
266. hath observed, <q>That there was but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61804:66"/>
one Comfort which the poor Reformers
could pick out of the whole Act, That
they were not left to the Mercy of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
in their Ecclesiastical Courts, but were
to be Tryed by a Jury, where they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more Candid and Gentle Dealing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But though these Matters were thereby
to be brought before a <hi>Jury,</hi> yet so great
were the Arts and Industry of the Bishops,
and those who were then most Zealous to
uphold <hi>Popery,</hi> that they endeavour'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to bring back these things to their
way of Determining without, and to lay
aside <hi>Juries,</hi> and often when these Matters
were brought before <hi>Juries,</hi> they did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe
them, and overstrained this Law, and
so dreadful were the Storms, and so griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the Persecutions against the then Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
that in the <hi>35th.</hi> Year of the same
Kings Reign, to qualifie the Severity, (as
by the Record thereof, and <hi>Rastal</hi>'s Book
of Printed Statutes at large, 35 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 5.
may be seen) that whereas by force of the
former Statute of 31 <hi>H. 8. Certain false
Accusations and Presentments were brought
against the Kings Subjects; and such Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
and Presentments were kept secret from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61804:66"/>
the knowledge of the Accused, till time espyed,
and they by Malice Convict, to the great
Peril and Danger of the Subject.</hi> It was
therefore Enacted, that Presentments and
Indictments on the said Statute, whereunto
any Person shall be call'd to answer, <hi>shall
be in open Court, upon the Oaths of Twelve
indifferent persons, according to Equity and
good Conscience, and as other Presentments
have been used to be taken in this Realm in
such <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Causes, according to the good
and laudable Custom and Vsage of the same.
And that the Inquiry and Tryals upon the
said Presentments and Indictments, may
Iustly and Charitably proceed without Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Malice accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Object against this last recited
Act, That the Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of the
six Articles, was afterwards, in the time
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Repealed, and
that this latter Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is also
Repealed, or of none Effect. It is to be
answered, That though the first be repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that the latter Statute, in what it
relates to the former Statute in that respect
be Repealed, or of no Use, yet as to what
<hi>it doth Declare and Affirm to be the Ancient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61804:67"/>
and long used Course of Law, that Juries
should proceed according to the Laudable
Custom and Vsage of this Realm, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to good Conscience and Equity, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without Malice or Corruption, and that
the Lives of the Subjects ought not to be drawn
into danger by False and Malicious Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Secret or Corrupt Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are such <hi>Fundamental Maxims,</hi>
and Rules of Law, as cannot be repealed,
and no Judges whatsoever may give any
Expositions to the contrary, any more than
they can do against <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or any
other Fundamental Maxims or Rules of our
Laws and Government.</p>
            <p>Thus you may see, what was then decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the <hi>greatest Authority on Earth, the
King, Lords and Commons in Parliament,</hi>
that the Laudable Custom and Usage of
this Realm, hath ever been for <hi>Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
to make their Presentments and Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to good Conscience and
Equity, and <hi>that they ought to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as well Charitably as Justly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore in such Matters as belong
to Grand Juries to enquire, or are brought
before them, they have as large Power as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61804:67"/>
a Lord Chancellour hath, in matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Cognisance. Well might Antiquity
call them Grand Juries, as <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
is called the Great Charer, from its great
and weighty Contents.</p>
            <p>Here I would not have it thought a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
to add, that having seemed before
to speak only of Grand Juries, and Juries
of Tryal in Criminal Causes, that the like
Rules are to be observed concerning Juries
a Tryal of Actions between Party and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the Judge should always leave the
matter impartially and fairly before them,
which would much diminish the number of
trivial Actions, as of slander for Words,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof there may be some doubt,
whether some of them would bear an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if the Judge would be pleased at the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
not to countenance either Party; where
a great Man sometimes will bring Action
against a mean or poor Man, for Words it
may be but slightly proved, though by
Witnesses of seeming Gravity, and not give
Directions thereupon, to give excessive
Damages by reason of the great Quality of
the Plaintiff.</p>
            <p>I shall further take leave to Observe, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61804:68"/>
               <hi>both Juries of Inquiry, and Juries of Tryal,
with their Power and Priviledges,</hi> are so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
the Rights of <hi>English-men,</hi> that even
when strong Endeavours were used to say
them aside by an Act of Parliament, which
<hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> (whom, though you
mentioned in your Book, and I must take
occasion to repeat with some Observation
thereon) had procured in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
without Juries; yet when, like wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Gardiners; (for Gardiners may be a
Simile for Councellors and Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Government, and be stiled good
or bad as they behave themselves) the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
<hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> instead of using
the Power they possest in their Masters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
which should have been for preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had cut down some of those Ancient
Trees of wholesom Fruit, [the way of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
and Tryal by Juries] and digged
deep to bury them by the Act of Parliament
they had obtained to that purpose, and
hoped they would never rise again: Yet,
<hi>there being a lasting Life in our good old
Laws,</hi> (though sometimes as little to be
discerned, as when the Life of Trees in
Winter-time retires invisibly to their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61804:68"/>
Roots:) The Act of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. was repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an Act of Parliament, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and
the Use of Juries restored <hi>and sprang up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
to the Confusion and Destruction of
those Treacherous Gardiners, of whom the
History is Famous enough, to be a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all others to avoid the like mischief.</p>
            <p>And how careful Judges have since been,
and ought to be to maintain the Ancient and
Rightful Course of Law, and not to go out
of it, may be seen in <hi>Anderson</hi>'s Reports,
<hi>fol.</hi> 156. where <hi>Empson</hi>'s Indictment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
at large. That Act of Parliament
by which he and <hi>Dudley,</hi> being as in the
<hi>94th. Psalm,</hi> ver. 20. like the seeking <hi>to
establish Mischeif by a Law,</hi> and so contrary
to the good Fundamental Law of <hi>England,</hi>
to Enquire and Try by Juries; <hi>That though
it was an Act of Parliament they acted by,
it proved too weak to save their Heads;</hi> and
became Fatal to them who procured, and
were chief Instruments in the Execution of
it, and the inferiour Instruments, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
and Promoters, were also severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished, and dyed shortly after, as
mentioned by the History of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, Written by the Lord <hi>Herbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61804:69"/>
As an Appendix to the Treatise of Juries,
might be also recommended to your Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
the late increase of <hi>Informations
in the Crown-Office of Court of the Kings
Bench in Criminal Cases, not specially and
particularly exprest or directed by any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;</hi>
for thereby the Subject is drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>hazard of Liberty and Estate,</hi> without
Presentment or Indictment of Grand Jury,
and thereby deprived of that <hi>great and
good out-guard of his</hi> Liberty and Property,
the Inquest by Oath of twelve Men, before
he should be brought to Tryal, which is
worth the Judges Care to rectifie, or will
he worthy the Consideration of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by a Law, more fully to remedy for
the future.</p>
            <p>By having after named <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
History, mentioned the Mischief, which
if not carefully prevented, would grow by
the Increase of the last mentioned Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the King's Bench, I do not in either
of these Cases, intend any Reflection on any
of the Judges; for as I am a Son of a Judge,
who whilst he lived made it his Care to
maintain, as well as use the Rules and due
course of Law, and often, as well in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61804:69"/>
as private Discourse, would praise the
Excellency of our Laws, and particularly
those of Enquiry and Tryal by <hi>Juries;</hi> I
bear such Honourable Respect and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the present Judges, as to believe and
hope, that whatsoever (may sometimes
happen) they always do, and will for the
future, make it their Care to preserve the
Law in its due Course, and to prevent any
Mischief or Inconvenience from Entring or
Growing in the Use or Practice of it.</p>
            <p>I would here close, but that I could not
totally forbear to take some Notice of the
Ways, which are used to punish those <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
who do not Conform in the Outward
Manner of Worship and Ceremonies, though
they agree with our</hi> English Church <hi>in the
Main Doctrines thereof,</hi> and in all respects
behave themselves <hi>Peaceably,</hi> whereof I
crave leave freely to say my Mind.</p>
            <p>That, though I love our Church, and
frequently and duely receive the Sacrament,
and I, and all my Family come constantly
to Church every Sunday, (except hindred
by Sickness, or other Extraordinary Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment)
and continue decently there, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the Time of Divine Service; and I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61804:70"/>
so well love the <hi>Common-Prayers</hi> thereof,
that I use part of them in my Family; and
would perswade all I can to the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;
yet I have that Kindness to all
those Protestants, commonly call'd <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
who by reason of <hi>Tenderness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
different Education, or Vse of other
manner of Worship, and who, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in Opinion, concerning some lesser Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
yet hold the main Doctrine of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
wherein all Protestants agree,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their different manner of Worship.</p>
            <p>And I could use many Arguments for
<hi>Gentleness</hi> towards them; whereof I shall
here only name the <hi>Topicks</hi> of some of them;
which are,</p>
            <p>From the common sense of Humanity.</p>
            <p>From Principles of Right Reason.</p>
            <p>From Christian Charity.</p>
            <p>From Divine Command, and the Holy
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>From its being well pleasing to God, and
the Way to have his Blessing.</p>
            <p>That the beginning of Persecution of, and
among Christians, was from Antichristian
Principles.</p>
            <p>That Persecution is chiefly used by the
<hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61804:70"/>
That Vnion of Protestants is the Common
Interest of the Protestant Religion, both here
and abroad.</p>
            <p>That Vnion of Protestants is the best way
to preserve and defend us from the Idolatry,
Policy, and Force of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the safety of Christendom depends
upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the best way to preserve the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> so as thereby it would Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
and hinder the <hi>French King</hi> from
gaining the <hi>Vniversal Monarchy,</hi> and be a
means to preserve the Countries and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of <hi>all other Princes of Europe in</hi> Safety.</p>
            <p>That it would much encrease the Peopling
of this Land by quiet dwelling here.</p>
            <p>That it would infinitely inrich this Nation
by increase of Trade, and Value of Land.</p>
            <p>That Trade being thereby encreas'd, his
Majesties Customs will be also very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd.</p>
            <p>That Gentleness, Mercy and Kindness, are:
honourable Qualities.</p>
            <p>That these Qualities are agreeable unto
the Gracious Expressions of his Majesty, to his
Protestants Subjects concerning the fame.</p>
            <p>That it is suitable to the Kindness he shewes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61804:71"/>
to the Persecuted <hi>French Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we hope some of his Counsellors and
our Best Magistrates, are of the like Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Mind,</hi> concerning Gentleness to be
used to <hi>Protestant Dissenters,</hi> and that the
Measure of their Goodness, will be esteem'd
and taken by the Degrees of their Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to such Gentleness.</p>
            <p>I could name more Particulars, from
whence much might be said on every of
them to this purpose; which Task, though
it would be rather pleasant than difficult, I
shall not meddle with, but leave it to some
other, who will better perform it than I
can, it being unnecessary here to say more
thereof, because it is here only proper to
Observe how some late Acts of Parliament,
relating to Church Matters, leaving the
Trust of punishing thereby, to the Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Magistrates, without the use of
<hi>Juries</hi> (which is so great a Trust, as was
not usally left to any Judges in former Ages)
those who have that Power ought to be the
more careful, discreetly and prudently to
use it with Moderation, <hi>and not to abuse so
great a Trust by overstraining such Laws
hunting after, and taking all Occasions they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61804:71"/>
can to punish their fellow Subjects with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
or beyond the Rigor, and contrary to the
Intention of those Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas one of the late Acts, allows
an <hi>Appeal,</hi> it may yet seem hard for an
<hi>Englishman,</hi> to be put to that <hi>after-game</hi> of
a hopeless Tryal of his Appeal by a <hi>Jury,</hi>
when he is deprived of his <hi>first legal Guard,
a Grand Jury,</hi> to whom by the <hi>Laudable
and Ancient Vsage of</hi> England, <hi>all Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Indictments in Criminal Matters
do belong.</hi> And it is further to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Person who is brought into
this Trouble, may be under great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whether to desire, or how to manage
his Appeal, when, perhaps, <hi>all his Goods,</hi>
by selling whereof he might provide Money
to deposite, as the Law requires, before he
can be admitted to Appeal, <hi>are taken from
him by Distress, and at last his Appeal shall
be tryed before the same Justices,</hi> that inflicted
the Penalty on him, and also that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
at the Tryal shall be managed by
the Informers, who are to be Sharers of the
Profit, they can get by the poor Man's ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These are some of the Considerations I
could not omit to mention, together with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61804:72"/>
my wish, that the good Reputation of our
Ancient Laws, may not be clouded by any
more such New Laws, as herein seem to
imitate Ecclesiastical Courts, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are without Juries, which it seems
some of our Clergy in times past, did think
to bring to pass, whereof, though I could
mention some Instances, I shall only cite
one fully to our purpose, out of the Lord</hi>
Cokes <hi>2d. part of</hi> Institutes, <hi>being his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
on some Statutes,</hi> fol. 599, <hi>&amp;c. where
he saith,</hi> It will conduce much to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of this matter, to report unto you
what Articles Archbishop <hi>Bancrost</hi> exhibited
in the Name of the Clergy, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
Term, 3 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> to the Lords of the Council,
against the Judges of the Realm, Entituled,
Certain Articles of Abuses, which are desired
to be reformed in granting Prohibitions. And
the Answers thereunto, upon mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Consideration, in <hi>Easter</hi> Term
following by all the Judges and Barons of the
Exchequer, with one unanimous consent under
their Hands, Resolutions, which were by
them delivered to the Lords of the Council,
and for distinction-sake, because there might
be occasion often to cite them, called, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi
Cleri, 3 <hi>Jacobi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61804:72"/>
These Articles, and their Answers being
very long, I must refer to be there read, as
being very material to be known, how
the Clergy endeavoured to get the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Businesses into their Courts, to be
determined without Juries, and so encroach
upon, and alter the Course therein, of our
good <hi>English</hi> Laws and Government. At
the end of those Articles and Answers, the
same Author further saith,</p>
            <p>That the Clergy claimed to Interpret all
Statute-Laws, concerning the Clergy; but it
was resolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi>
That the Interpretation of Statutes concerning
the Clergy, being a parcel of the Laws of the
Realm, belong to the Judges of the Common
Law. <hi>And saith,</hi> Magna est veritas &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valet.
<hi>To which, as agreeing to the truth
thereof, I may add,</hi> Lex <hi>Angliae</hi> optima
est, &amp; praevalebit.</p>
            <p>I would not have any of our present Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
think I reflect on them, for I truly and
heartily Honour, some of our Bishops and
Dignified Clergy, and any others of them,
whose soundness of Doctrine, great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and good and sober Lives, are, and
might be, Examples for all the rest, and for
whose sake, I bear Civil Respect to the rest
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61804:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that are not altogether so praise worthy, as
those Good and most Reverend Men, to
whom I bear my chief Respects, but shall
say no more of any of them here, but that I
hope, they will leave off severe Punishing
their fellow-Christians, <hi>and for bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Col. 3. 13 <hi>And study to be quiet, and
meddle with their own Business,</hi> 1 Thes. 4.
11. And that by a re-view of these Laws,
these things will in due time receive pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and gentle as well as sufficient Cure and
Remedy in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I hope you will pardon me,
for having, perhaps, been too tedious, seeing
your excellent Treatise contains so much on
the behalf of Juries, that all that I can say,
may seem needless; and you may think fit
to lay aside what I have written; yet if it

know, to whom we owe our Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Peace might cause a new Inquest to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
(but the words, <hi>take Inquest,</hi> do not
give the Justices power to name, who shall
be returned, <hi>which is the Sheriffs Office)</hi> and
it is to be only and purposely to enquire of
such Concealment; and doth not extend to
enquire of any other Offences whatsoever;
and then after such wilful Concealment is
found by such Inquest, <hi>The same Justices of
the Peace in the County Sessions, might fine
the Jury of the former Inquest.</hi> By which may
be observed, That <hi>the said clause of the said
Act of</hi> 3 H. 7. <hi>doth fully and clearly prove,
that by the common Law, Juries were not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
concerning their Presentments, Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Verdicts.</hi> And even that Clause,
since that time, being One hundred, Ninety
and four Years, or thereabouts, hath seldom
or never been used. Our Books of Reports
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61804:74"/>
of Law-Cases not affording any plain or full
Instance of any Proceeding on that Clause of
that Statute. Therefore it may seem, as
<hi>Littleton</hi> saith in his Book, <hi>Sect. 108. That
in as much as it was never seen or heard, that
any Action was brought on the Statute of</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>(which was made</hi> 20 H. 3.) <hi>For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he treats of in that Section, no Action could
be brought thereon. For if any Action might
have been brought for that matter, it shall be
intended, that it would some time or other
have been put in ure.</hi> And with this agrees
the Ld. <hi>Coke,</hi> in his Comment on that place.
And also the Judges, in their Arguments on
a late case of Action brought on the Statute,
about the Return of Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did cite the said place of <hi>Littleton.</hi>
By which appears concerning such unusual
manner of final Juries by the Clause of 3 <hi>H.</hi>
7. how there ought to be great Caution, in
Executing any Acts or Statutes, where they
alter the Common Law and Course thereof;
seeing that Act of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in that particular,
and other memorable things therein, made
then such Alterations of the Common Law
of this Realm, as I forbear any further here
to mention.</p>
