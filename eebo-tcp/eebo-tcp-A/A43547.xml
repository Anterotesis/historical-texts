            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T my being with you last, you seemed to bee much scandalized for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> You told me you were well assured that her <hi>Doctrine</hi> was most true and orthodox, her <hi>Government</hi> conform to the word of God, and the best Ages of the Church; her <hi>Liturgy</hi> an Extract of the Primitive Formes: Nothing in all the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure but what did tend to edification, and increase of Piety. But that you were not satisfied in the waies and meanes by which this Church proceeded in her <hi>Reformation</hi>: That you had heard it oft objected by some Partisans of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54783:3"/>
was meere <hi>Parliamentarian;</hi> or, as Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> said long since, That <hi>we had a Parliament-Religion, a Parliament-Faith, and a Parliament-Gospell;</hi> to which <hi>Sanders</hi> and some others added, That we had <hi>none but Parliament Bishops, and a Parliament-Clergy.</hi> That you were apt enough to think, the <hi>Papists</hi> made not all this noise without some ground for it, in regard you see the <hi>Parliaments</hi> in these latter times so bent to catch at all occasions whereby to manifest their power in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And finally, that you were heartily ashamed, that being so often choaked with these objections, you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew how to traverse the Inditement, or plead not guilty to the Bill. This was the sum of your Discourse; and upon this you did desire me to be think my selfe of some fit plaister for this sore, to satisfie you (if I could) of your doubts and jealousies, assuring me that your desires proceeded not from curiositie, or an itch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or out of any disaffection to the high Court of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> but meerly from an honest zeale to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose credit and renown you did far prefer before your life, or whatsoever else could be deere unto you; adding withall, That if I would take paines for your satisfaction, and help you out of those perplexities which you were involved in, I should not
<pb facs="tcp:54783:3"/>
only doe good service to the Church it selfe, but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a wavering Member of it, whom these objections mainly stagger in their Resolution. In fine, that you desired to be informed how far the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have been interessed, in the former times, in matters which concern <hi>Religion,</hi> and God's publique worship; what ground there is for all this clamour of the <hi>Papists</hi>; and whether the two Houses, or eyther of them have exercised, of old, any such authority in things of <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall</hi> nature, as they now pretend to. VVhich, though it be a dangerous and invidious Subject (as the times now are) yet for your sake, and for the truths, and for the honour also of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> which seeme to suffer much in the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall undertake it; Premising first, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to say any thing to the point of <hi>Right,</hi> whether or not the <hi>Parliament</hi> may lawfully meddle in such matters as concern <hi>Religion,</hi> but shall apply my selfe only unto matters of fact, as they relate unto the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> here by Lawe established. And for my method in this businesse, I will begin with the <hi>Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his authority; descending next to the <hi>Translation</hi> of the Scriptures into the <hi>English</hi> tongue, and the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals</hi> and <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> and so proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:54783:4"/>
the power of making <hi>Canons</hi> for the well ordering of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the direction of the people in all such particulars as doe concern them in the exercise of their <hi>Religion.</hi> And in the canvasing of these points, I shall make it good, that till these busie and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate dayes, in which every man intrudeth on the <hi>Preistly</hi> function, the <hi>Parliaments</hi> did not any thing at all either in matters <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> or in making <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> or in <hi>translating</hi> of the Scriptures; and that concerning <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> they did nothing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but strengthen and establish what was done before in the <hi>Clergy-way,</hi> by adding the Secular authority to the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the Church, according to the usage of the best and happiest times of Christianity.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND first, beginning with the <hi>Ejection</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his authority, that led the way unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion which did after follow: It was first voted and decreed in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> before ever it became the subject of an Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> For in the yeare 1530. 22<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>H.</hi> 8. the <hi>Clergy</hi> being caught in a <hi>Premunire</hi> were willing to redeeme their danger by a summe of money, and to that end the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> bestowed upon the king the summe of 100000 pounds, to be paid by equall portions in the five yeares following. But the king would not so be satisfied unlesse they would acknowledge him for the <hi>supreme head on Earth of the Church of England,</hi> which though it was hard meate, and would not easily downe amongst them, yet it passed at last. For, being throughly debated in a <hi>Synodicall</hi> way, both in the upper and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er houses of <hi>Convocation,</hi> they did in fine agree upon this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>Cujus (Ecclesiae sc. Anglicanae) singularem Protectorem, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum et supremum Dominum, et (quantum per Christi leges licet) supremum Caput, ipsius Majestatem recognoscimus.</hi> To this they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54783:5"/>
all assented and subscribed their hands, and afterwards incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it into the publique Act or Instrument, which was presented to the King in the name of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> for the redeeming of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the graunt of their money, which as it doth at large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Records and Acts of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> so is it touched upon in an Historicall way in the <hi>Antiq. Britan: Mason de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist. Anglic.</hi> and some other Authors; by whom it also doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that what was thus concluded on by the Clergy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was also ratified and confirmed by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> for the Province of <hi>Yorke</hi> (according to the usuall custom) save that they did not buy their Pardon at so deare a rate. This was the leading Card to the game which followed. For on this ground were built the <hi>Statutes</hi> prohibiting all <hi>Appeales</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for <hi>determining all Ecclesiasticall suites and controversies within the Kingdome</hi> 24. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12. That for <hi>the manner of Electing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating of Archbishops and Bishops.</hi> 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. and, the <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the payment of all impositions to the Court of Rome</hi>; and <hi>for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning all such Dispensations from the See of</hi> Canterbury <hi>which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were procured from the Popes of Rome.</hi> 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c,</hi> 21. which last is built expresly upon this foundation; <hi>That the King is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supreme Head of the Church of England, and was so recognized by the Prelates and Clergy, representing the said Church in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> And on the very same foundation was the Statute raised 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. where in the King is declared <hi>to be the supreme head of the Church of England, &amp; to have all honors &amp; Preeminencies which were annexed unto that Title,</hi> as by the Act it selfe doth at full ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, which Act being made (I speake it from the Act it selfe) only for <hi>corroboration and confirmation</hi> of that which had beene done in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> did afterwards draw on the Statute for the <hi>Tenths</hi> and <hi>First-fruits,</hi> as the point incident to the <hi>Headship</hi> or supreme authority, 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8, <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The second step to the <hi>Ejection</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> was the <hi>submission of the Clergy</hi> to the said <hi>K. Henry,</hi> whom they had recognized for their <hi>supreme Head.</hi> And this was first concluded on in the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> before it was proposed or agitated in the houses of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and was commended only to the care of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that it might have the force of a Law by a <hi>civill Sanction.</hi> The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54783:5"/>
whole debate with all the traverses and emergent difficulties which appeared therein are specified at large in the Records of <hi>Convocation, Anno</hi> 1532. But being you have not oportunity to consult those Records, I shall prove it by the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> called commonly the <hi>Act of the submission of the Clergy,</hi> but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Title in the <hi>Abridgement</hi> of the Statutes set out by <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, That the Clergy in their</hi> Convocations <hi>shall enact no Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without the Kings assent.</hi> In which it is premised for granted that the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> had not only <hi>acknowledg'd according to the Truth, that the</hi> Convocation <hi>of the same</hi> Clergy, <hi>is, alwaies hath beene, and ought to be assembled alwaies by the Kings Writ; but also submitting themselves to the Kings Majesty, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi> in verbo Sacerdotii, <hi>That they would never from henceforth presume to attempt, alleage, claime, or put in ure, enact, promulge or execute any new</hi> Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or other, <hi>or by whatsoever other name they shall be called in the</hi> Convocation, <hi>unlesse the Kings most Royall assent may to them be had, to make, promulge and execute the same, and that his Majestie doe give his most royall Assent and Authority in that behalfe.</hi> Upon which ground worke of the <hi>Clergies,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> shortly after built this superstructure, to the same effect: <hi>viz. That none of the said</hi> Clergy <hi>from thenceforth should presume to attempt, alleage, claime or put in ure any</hi> Constitutions <hi>or</hi> Ordinances, Provinciall or Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, <hi>or any other</hi> Canons; <hi>nor shall enact, promulge, or execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such</hi> Canons, Constitutions, <hi>or</hi> Ordinances Provinciall <hi>(by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever name or names they may be called) in their</hi> Convocations <hi>in time comming (which alwaies shall be assembled by the kings Writ) unlesse the same</hi> Clergy <hi>may have the kings most royall Assent and Licence to make, promulge and execute such</hi> Canons, Constitutions <hi>and</hi> Ordinances Provinciall <hi>or</hi> Synodicall, <hi>upon paine of every one of the said</hi> Clergy <hi>doing the contrary to this Act, and thereof convict, to suffer imprisonment and make fine at the kings will.</hi> 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. So that the <hi>Statute,</hi> in effect, is no more than this, an <hi>Act</hi> to bind the <hi>Clergy</hi> to performe their promise, to keepe them fast unto their word for the time to come, that no new <hi>Canon</hi> should bee made in the times succeeding in favour of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or to the diminution of the <hi>Kings Royall Prerogative,</hi> or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54783:6"/>
contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> as many <hi>Papall Constitutions</hi> were in the former Ages: which <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> I desire you to take notice of, because it is the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Churches power in making <hi>Canons, Constitutions,</hi> or whatsoever else you shall please to call them in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</hi>

Entituled an <hi>Act extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of Rome.</hi> By which it was Enacted <hi>That if any person should extoll the authority of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>he should incurre the penalty of a Praemunire; that every Officer, both</hi> Ecclesiasticall <hi>and</hi> Lay, <hi>should be sworne to renounce the said Bishop and his authority, and to resist it to his power, and to repute any Oath formerly taken in maintenance of the said Bishop, or his authority, to be void; and finally that the refusall of the said Oath should be judged high Treason.</hi> But this was also usherd in by the Determination first, and after by the Practice of all the <hi>Clergie.</hi> For in the yeare 1534, which was two yeares before the passing of this Act, the King had sent this <hi>Proposition</hi> to be agitated in both <hi>Vniversities,</hi> and in the greatest and most famous <hi>Monasteries</hi> of the Kingdome, that is to say, <hi>An aliquid authoritatis in hoc regno Angliae</hi> Pontifici Romano <hi>de jure competat plus quam alii cuicunque Episcopo extero?</hi> By whom it was determined <hi>Negatively,</hi> that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no more power of right in the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> than any other forraigne Bishop: Which being testified and returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands and seales respectively (the Originals whereof are still remayning in the Library of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>) was a good preamble to the Bishops and the rest of the Clergy assembled in their <hi>Convocation</hi> to conclude the like. And so accordingly they did, and made an <hi>Instrument</hi> thereof subscribed by the hands of all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and others of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and afterwards confirmed the same by their <hi>corporall Oathes</hi>: The copies of which <hi>Oathes</hi> and <hi>Instrument</hi> you shall finde in <hi>Foxes Acts and Monuments vol.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 1203. and <hi>fol.</hi> 1210. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1211. of the Edition of <hi>Iohn Day, An.</hi> 1570. And this was semblably the ground of a following Statute 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Wherein another <hi>Oath</hi> was devised and ratified, to be imposed upon the Subject, for the more cleare asserting of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54783:6"/>
                  <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> and the utter exclusion of the <hi>Popes</hi> for ever; which Statutes though they were all repealed by one Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. of <hi>Phil. &amp; Mary c.</hi> 8. yet they were brought in force againe 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. save that the name of <hi>Supreme Head</hi> was changed unto that of the <hi>Supreme Governour,</hi> and certaine clauses altered in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> Where (by the way) you must take notice that the Statutes which concerne the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> are not <hi>introductory</hi> of any new Right, that was not in the Crown before, but only <hi>declaratory</hi> of an old, as our best Lawyers tell us, and the Statute of the 26. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. doth clearly intimate. So that in the <hi>Ejection</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the first and greatest step towards the worke of <hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> did nothing, for ought yet appeares, but what was done before in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and did no more than fortifie the results of <hi>Holy Church</hi> by the Addition and Corroboration of the <hi>Secular Power.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE second step towards the worke of <hi>Reformation,</hi> (and indeed one of the most especiall parts thereof) was the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and the permitting all sorts of people to peruse the same, as that which visibly did tend to the discovery of the errors and corruptions in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the intolerable Pride and Tyranny of the <hi>Romane</hi> Prelates, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which grounds it had beene formerly translated into <hi>English</hi> by the hand of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and after, on the spreading of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine, by the paines of <hi>Tyndall,</hi> a stout and active man in king <hi>Henries</hi> daies, but not so well befreinded as the worke deserved: especially considering that it happened in such a time when many printed Pamphlets did disturbe the State (and some of them of <hi>Tindals</hi> making) which seemed to tend unto Sedition and the change of Government. Which being remonstrated to the King, he caused divers of his Bishops, together with sundry of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedest and most eminent Divines of all the Kingdome to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: whom he required freely and plainly to declare aswell
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54783:7"/>
what their opinion was of the foresaid <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> as what they did thinke fit to be done concerning the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue; And they upon mature advise and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, unanimously condemned the aforesaid bookes of Heresie and Blasphemie (no smaller crime.) Then, for <hi>translating</hi> of the Scriptures into the <hi>English</hi> tongue, they agreed all with one assent, that it depended wholly on the Will and Pleasure of the Soveraign Prince, who might doe therein as he conceived to be most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his occasions; but that with reference to the present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of things, it was more expedient to explaine the Scripture to the people by the way of <hi>Sermons,</hi> then to permit it to be read pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously by all sorts of men: yet so that hopes were to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the <hi>Laity,</hi> that if they did renounce their errours, and presently deliver to the hands of his Majesties Officers all such bookes and <hi>Bibles</hi> (which they conceived to bee translated with great fraud and falshood) as any of them had in keeping, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty would cause a true and catholick <hi>Translation</hi> of it to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in convenient time, for the use of his Subjects. This was the summe and substance of the present <hi>Conference,</hi> which you shall finde laid downe at large in the Registers of Archbishop <hi>Warham.</hi> And according to this advice the King sets out a <hi>Proclamation</hi> 
                  <q>not only prohibiting the buying, reading, or translating of any the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid bookes, but straitly charging all his Subjects which had any of the bookes of Scripture, eyther of the old Testament or of the new, in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, to bring them in without delay.</q> But for the other part, of giving hopes unto the people of a true <hi>Translation,</hi> if they delivered in the false (or that at least which was pretended to be false) I finde no word at all in the <hi>Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That was a worke reserved unto better times, or left to be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the Bishops themselves, and other learned men who had given the counsell; by whom (indeede) the people were kept up in hope that all should bee accomplished unto their desires.</p>
               <p>And so indeed it proved at last. For in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the yeare 1536. the authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> being abrogated, and <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> fully setled in the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> did agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a forme of Petition to be presented to the King, that he would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54783:7"/>
graciously indulge unto his Subjects of the <hi>Laity</hi> the reading of the <hi>Bible</hi> in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, and that a new <hi>Translation</hi> of it might be forth with made for that end and purpose. According to which godly motion, his Majesty did not only give order for a new <hi>Translation,</hi> which afterwards he authorized to be read both in publique and private; but in the <hi>interim</hi> he permitted <hi>Cromwell</hi> his <hi>Vicar-Generall</hi> to set out an <hi>Injunction</hi> for providing the whole <hi>Bible</hi> both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> after the <hi>translation</hi> then in use, (which was call'd commonly by the name of <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <hi>Bible,</hi> but was indeede no other, than that of <hi>Tyndall</hi> somewhat altered) to be kept in every parish Church throughout the kingdome, for every one that would to repaire unto, and caused this marke or character of authority to be set upon them in red Letters <hi>Set forth with the Kings most Gracious Licence,</hi> which you may see in <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts &amp; Monum. p.</hi> 1248. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1363<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterwards, when the new <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation</hi> so often promised, and so long expected, was complete and finished, printed at <hi>London</hi> by the Kings authority, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by a grave and pious Preface of Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>; the King sets out a <hi>Proclamation</hi> dated May. 6. <hi>An.</hi> 1541.<q>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the <hi>Curates</hi> and <hi>Parishioners</hi> throughout the kingdome, who were not already furnished with <hi>Bibles</hi> so authorized and translated as before is said, to provide themselves before <hi>Alhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi> next following, and to cause the <hi>Bibles</hi> so provided to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced conveniently in their severall and respective Churches; straitly requiring all his Bishops and other Ordinaries to take speciall care, to see his said Commands put in execution.</q> And therewithall came out <hi>Instructions</hi> from the King to be published by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their severall parishes, the better to possesse the people with the Kings good affection towards them in suffering them to have the benefit of such heavenly Treasure; and to direct them in a course by which they might enjoy the same to their greater comfort, the reformation of their lives, and the peace and quiet of the Church. Which <hi>Proclamation</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> are still preserved in that most admirable Treasury of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton.</hi> And unto these Commands of so great a Prince, both Bishops, Priests and People did apply themselves with such cheerefull reverence, that <hi>Bonner</hi> (even that bloody butcher, as he after proved) caused sixe of them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54783:8"/>
to be chayned in severall places of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in <hi>London,</hi> for all that were so well inclined to resort unto, for their edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and instruction, the booke being very chargeable, because very large; and therefore called commonly (for distinctions sake) <hi>The Bible of the greater Volume.</hi> Thus have we seene the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> faithfully <hi>Translated</hi> into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, the <hi>Bible</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly set up in all parish-churches, that ev'ry one w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would might peruse the same, and leave permitted to all people to buy them for their private uses, and reade them to themselves, or before their families, and all this brought about by no other meanes than by the Kings authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only grounded on the advice and judgement of the <hi>Convocation.</hi> But long it was not I confesse, before the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> put in for a share, and claimed some interest in the worke; but whether for the better or the worse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I leave you to judge. For in the yeare 1542, the King being then in agitation of a league with <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, he caused a complaint to be made unto him in his Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> 
                  <q>That the liberty granted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in having in their hands the bookes of the old and new <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> had beene much abused by many false glosses and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were made upon them, tending to the seducing of the people, especially of the younger sort, and the raysing of sedition within the Realme. </q>And thereupon it was enacted by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Parliament</hi> (on whom he was content to cast the envy of an Act so contrary to his former gracious <hi>Proclamations</hi>) <hi>that all manner of bookes of the old and new</hi> Testament <hi>of the crafty, false, and untrue Translation of</hi> Tyndall, <hi>be forthwith abolished, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be used and kept. As also, that all other</hi> Bibles <hi>not being of</hi> Tyndalls <hi>translation in which were found any Preambles or Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, other than the quotations or Summaries of the Chapters, should be purged of the said Preambles and Annotations, eyther by cutting them out, or blotting them in such wise that they might not be perceived or read.</hi> And finally <hi>that the</hi> Bible <hi>be not read openly in any Church, but by the leave of the King or of the Ordinary of the place; nor privately by any Women, Artificers, Prentices, Iourneymen, Husbandmen, Labourers, or by any of the servants of Yeomen or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> with severall paines to those who should doe the contrary. This is the substance of the Statute of the 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54783:8"/>
which though it shewes that there was somewhat done in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in a matter which concern'd <hi>Religion</hi> (which howsoever if you marke it, was rather the adding of the <hi>penalties,</hi> than giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny resolution or decision of the points in Question) yet I presume the <hi>Papists</hi> will not use this for an Argument, that we have eyther a <hi>Parliament-Religion,</hi> or a <hi>Parliament-Gospell</hi>; or that we stand indebted to the <hi>Parliament</hi> for the use of the Scriptures in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Tongue, which is so principall a part of the Reformation. Nor did the <hi>Parliament</hi> speede so prosperously in the undertakiug (which the wise King permitted them to have an hand in for the foresaid ends) or found so generall an obedience in it from the common people, as would have beene expected in these times, on the like occasion; but that the King was faine to quicken and give life to the Acts thereof by his <hi>Proclamatiom. An.</hi> 1546. which you shall find in <hi>Fox</hi> his booke. <hi>fol.</hi> 1427.</p>
               <p>To drive this nayle a little farther. The terror of this Statute dying with <hi>H.</hi> 8. or being repealed by that of K. <hi>E.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12. the <hi>Bible</hi> was againe made publique; and not only suffered to be read by particular persons, either privately, or in the Church; but ordered to be read over yearely in the Congregation, as a part of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or divine Service; which how farre it relates to the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> we shall see anon. But for the publishing thereof in print for the use of the people, for the comfort and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of private persons, that was done only by the King, at least in his name, and by his authority. And so it also stood in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> being againe review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some of the most learned Bishops appointed thereunto by the <hi>Queenes</hi> Commission (from whence it had the name of the <hi>Bishops-Bible</hi>) and upon that Review, reprinted by her sole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and by her sole authority left free and open to the use of her well affected and Religious Subjects. Nor did the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> doe any thing in all her Reigne with reference to the Scriptures in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, otherwise than as the reading of them in that tongue in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> is to be reckoned for a part of the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> whereof more hereafter. In the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation</hi> of them into <hi>Welch</hi> or <hi>British,</hi> somewhat indeed was done which doth looke this way. It being ordered in the <hi>Parliament</hi>

5. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 28. That the B.

And for the new <hi>Translation</hi> of K. <hi>Iames</hi> his time, to shew that the <hi>Translation</hi> of Scripture is no worke of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as it was principally occasioned by some passages in the <hi>Conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> without recourse unto the <hi>Parliament,</hi> so was it done only by such men as the King appointed, and by his authority alone imprinted, published and imposed; care being taken by the <hi>Canon</hi> of the yeare 1603. <hi>That one of them should be provided for each severall Church, at the charge of the Parish.</hi> No flying in this case to an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> either to authorize the doing of it, or to impose it being done.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ext, let us look upon the method used in former times in the <hi>reforming</hi> of the Church, whether in points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or in <hi>formes</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and we shall find it still the same. The <hi>Clergy</hi> did the worke as to them seemed best, never advising with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but upon the <hi>post fact,</hi> and in most cases not at all. And first for <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals,</hi> there was but little done in king <hi>Henries</hi> time but that which was acted by the <hi>Clergie</hi> only in their <hi>Convocations,</hi> and so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54783:9"/>
commended to the people by the Kings sole authority, the matter never being brought within the cognizance of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For in the yeare 1536, being the yeare in which the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie was for ever banished, there were some <hi>Articles</hi> agreed on in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and represented to the King, under the hands of all the Bishops, Abbats, Priors, and inferiour Clergy usually called unto those meetings; the Originall whereof being in Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Library I have often seene: which being approved of by the King, were forthwith published under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Articles devised by the Kings Highnesse to stable Christian quietnesse and unity amongst the people.</hi> In which it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, first; that those <hi>Articles</hi> make mention of 3 Sacraments only, that is to say of <hi>Baptisme, Penance,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar.</hi> And secondly, that in the declaration of the Doctrine of <hi>Iustification, Images, honouring of the Saints departed,</hi> as also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many of the usuall Ceremonies, and the fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> they differ'd very much from those opinions which had beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as you may partly see by that extract of them which occurres in <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vol.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 1246. For the confirming of which booke, and recommending it to the use of the people, his Majesty was pleased in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of the yeare 1536. to give command<q>To all Deanes, Parsons, Vicars and Curats, so to open and declare in their Sermons and other Collations the said <hi>Articles</hi> unto them which be under their Cure, that they might plainly know and discerne, which of them be necessary to be beleeved and observed for their salvation, and which doe only concerne the Decent and politique Order of the Church. </q>And this he did upon this ground, that <hi>the said</hi> Articles <hi>had beene concluded and condiscended upon by the</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>and</hi> Clergy <hi>of the Realme</hi> in their <hi>Convocation,</hi> as appeareth in the very words of the <hi>Injunction</hi>: for which see <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments fol.</hi> 1247. I finde not any thing in <hi>Parliament</hi> which relates to this, either to countenance the worke, or to require obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and conformity from the hands of the people. And, to say truth, neither the King nor Clergy did account it necessary, but thought their owne authority sufficient to goe through with it, though certainly it was more necessary at that time then in any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54783:10"/>
since, the power and reputation of the <hi>Clergy</hi> being under foot, the King scarce setled in the <hi>Supremacy</hi> so lately recognized unto him, and therfore the authority of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of more use than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in times well ballanced and established.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that in some other yeares of that Princes Reigne, we finde some use and mention of an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in matters which concern'd Religion, but in was only in such times when the hopes of <hi>Reformation</hi> were in the wane, and the worke went retrograde. For in the yeare 1539. being the 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. When the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s power began to decline, and the King was in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of compliance with his neighbouring Princes, there passed an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> commonly called the Statute of the six <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> (or the whip with six stringes) In which it was enacted. <q>
                     <hi>That whosoever by word or writing should preach, teach, or publish, that in the blessed Sacrament of the</hi> Altar, <hi>under forme of bread and wine, there is not really the naturall Body and Blood of our</hi> Saviour Jesus Christ, <hi>conceived of the virgin</hi> Mary, (<hi>or affirme otherwise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then was maintained and taught in the Church of</hi> Rome) <hi>should be adjudged an</hi> Heretick, <hi>and suffer death by burning, and forfeit all his Lands and Goods, as in case of high Treason. Secondly, that Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver should teach or preach, that the Communion of the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in both kindes <hi>is necessary for the health of mans Soule, and ought so to be ministred. Thirdly, or that any man after the</hi> Order <hi>of</hi> Priest-hood <hi>received might</hi> marry, <hi>or contract matrimony: Fourthly, or that any woman which had</hi> vowed <hi>and professed</hi> chastity, <hi>might contract marriage. Fifthly, or that</hi> private Masse <hi>were not lawfull and laudable, and agreeable to the word of God. Or, sixthly, that</hi> Auricular Confession <hi>was not necessary and expedient to be used in the Church of God, should suffer death, and forfeit Lands and Goods, as a felon.</hi> 31 <hi>of H.</hi> 8. <hi>c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 14. </q>The rigour of which terrible Statute was shortly after mitigated in the said Kings Reigne, 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c,</hi> 10. and 35. <hi>of H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5. and the whole Statute absolutely repealed by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12. But then it is to be observed first, that this <hi>Parliament</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, did not determine any thing in those six points of Doctrine which are therein recited, but only tooke upon them to devise a course for the <hi>suppressing</hi> of the contrary opinions, by adding by the secular Power, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

of Death, and forfeiture of Lands and Goods, unto the censures of the Church, which were grown weake, if not invalid; and consequently, by degrees became neglected ever since the said King <hi>Henry</hi> tooke the Headship on him, and exercised the same by a Lay <hi>Vicar-Generall.</hi> And secondly, you must observe that it appeareth evidently by the Act it selfe, that at the same time the King had called a <hi>Synod</hi> and <hi>Convocation of all the Archbishoppes, Bishoppes, and other learned men of the Clergy, that the Articles were first deliberately and advisedly debated, argued and reasoned by the said Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men of the Clergy, and their opinions in the same declared and made knowne,</hi> before the matter came in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and finally that being brought into the <hi>Parliament,</hi> there was not any thing declared and passed as <hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> but <hi>by the assent of the Lords spirituall, and other learned men of the Convocation,</hi> as by the Act it selfe doth at large appeare. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, whatsoever may be drawne from hence, can be only this, That King <hi>Henry</hi> did make use of his Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> for the establishing and confirming of some points of <hi>Popery,</hi> which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be in danger of a <hi>Reformation.</hi> And this compared with the Statute of the 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35. prohibiting the reading of the <hi>Bible</hi> by most sorts of people, doth clearely shew that the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of those times did rather hinder and retard the worke of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in some especiall parts thereof, than give any furtherance to the same.</p>
               <p>But to proceede. There was another point of <hi>Reformation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, but not produced, nor brought unto perfection till after his decease, and then too, not without the midwifery of an Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For in the yeare 1537. the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and others of the Clergy of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> had composed a booke entituled the <hi>Institution of a Christian man,</hi> which being subscribed by all their hands, was by them presented to the King, by his most excellent judgement to be allowed of, or condemned. This booke, conteyning the cheife heads of Christian Religion, was forth with printed, and exposed to publique view. But some things not being clearely explicated, or otherwise subject to exception, he caused it to be reviewed, and to that end; as <hi>Supreme Head, on Earth, of the Church of England</hi> (I speake the very words of the

Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Where note that the two houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> were so farre from medling in the matter which was then in hand, that they did not so much as require to see the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> and Decrees of those learned men whom his Majesty had then assembled, before they passed the present Act to binde the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fully to beleeve, observe and performe the same; but left it wholly to the judgement and discretion of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54783:11"/>
and trusted them besides with the ordaining and inflicting of such <hi>paines</hi> and <hi>penalties</hi> on disobedient and unconformable persons, as to them seemed meete.</p>
               <p>This ground worke laid, the worke went forwards in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and at last being brought unto as much perfection as the said Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men could give it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the cooperation and concurrence of the <hi>Royall assent,</hi> it was presented once againe to the King's consideration, who very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perused it, and alterd many things with his owne hand, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the booke it selfe still extant in the famous Library of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and having so altered and corrected it in some passages, returned it to the Arcbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed some further paines upon it, to the end that being to come forth in the Kings name, and by his authority, there should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the same which might be justly reprehended. The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being in this forwardnesse, the King declares in <hi>Parliament, An.</hi> 1544. being the 34 yeare of his Reigne <q>his zeale and care, not only to suppresse all such bookes and writings as were noysom and pestilent, and tended to the seducing of his subjects: but also to ordaine and establish a certaine forme of pure and sincere tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, agreeable to Gods Word, and the true doctrine of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church, whereunto men may have recourse for the decision of some such controversies, as have in times past, &amp; yet doe happen to arise.</q> And for a preparatory thereunto, that so it might come forth with the greater credit, he caused an Act to passe in <hi>Parliament</hi> for the <hi>abolishing of all bookes and writings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing any matters of</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>contrary to that doctrine which since the yeare</hi> 1540. <hi>is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any time during the Kings life, shall be set forth by his</hi> Highnesse, <hi>and for the punishment of all such</hi> (and that too with most grievous paines) <hi>which should preach, teach, mainteine or defend any matter or thing contrary to the</hi> booke of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>which was then in readinesse</hi> 34.35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Which done he caused the said booke to be imprinted in the yeare next following, under the Title of <hi>A necessary Doctrine for all sorts of people</hi>; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing a Preface thereto in his owne Royall name, to all his faithfull and loving Subjects, that they might know the better in those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, what to beleeve in point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and how they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54783:12"/>
were to carry and behave themselves in point of practice. which Statute, as it is the greatest evidence which those times afford, to shew, that both, or either of the houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> had any thing to doe in matters which concern'd <hi>Religion</hi>; so it entitles them to no more (if at all to any thing) then that they did make way to a booke of doctrine which was before digested by the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> only, revised after and corrected by the <hi>Kings</hi> owne hand, and finally perused and perfected by the <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> And more than so (besides, that being but one swallowe, it can make no summer) it is acknowledged and confessed in the Act it selfe (if <hi>Poulton</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it rightly in his <hi>Abridgement</hi>) that <hi>recourse must be had to the Catholick and Apostolick Church, for the decision of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi> Which as it gives the <hi>Clergy</hi> the Decisive power, so it left nothing to the Houses but to assist and ayde them with the <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> sword, when the <hi>Spirituall</hi> Word could not doe the deede, the point thereof being blunted, and the edge abated.</p>
               <p>Next let us looke upon the time of king <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and we shall find the <hi>Articles</hi> and Doctrine of the Church (excepting such as were conteined in the booke of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>) to be composed, confirmed and setled in no other way than by the <hi>Clergy</hi> only in their <hi>Convocation,</hi> the kings authority cooperating and concurring with them. For, in the <hi>Synod</hi> held in <hi>London An.</hi> 1552. The <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> did compose and agree upon a booke of Articles, conteining the chiefe heads of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> especially with referrence to such points of Controversie as were in difference betweene the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formators</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other opponents whatsoever; which after were approved and published by the Kings authority. They were in number 41, and were published by this following Title, that is to say, <hi>Articuli de quibus in</hi> Synodo London, <hi>An.</hi> 1552. <hi>ad tollendum opinionum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentionem, et consensum verae</hi> Religionis <hi>firmandum, inter</hi> Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos <hi>&amp; alios</hi> Eruditos viros <hi>convenerat, Regia Authoritate in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem Editi.</hi> And, it is worth our observation, that though the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> was held at the very time, and that the <hi>Parliament</hi> passed severall Acts which concerned Church-matters, as <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>Act for uniformity of Divine Service, and for the confirmation of the booke of Ordination,</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>An Act declaring which daies only shall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54783:12"/>
be kept for holy-dayes, and which for fasting dayes, c.</hi> 3. <hi>An Act against striking or drawing weapon either in the Church, or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c.</hi> 4. and finally another Act <hi>for the legitimating of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of Priests and Ministers, c.</hi> 12. yet neither in this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> nor in that which followed, is there so much as the least sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which reflects this way, or medleth any thing at all with the booke of <hi>Articles.</hi> Where, by the way, if you behold the lawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Priests Marriages</hi> as a matter <hi>Doctrinall,</hi> or thinke we owe that Point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the indulgence granted to the <hi>Clergy</hi> in it, to the care and goodnesse of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> you may please to know, that the point had beene before determined in the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and stands determined by and for the <hi>Clergy</hi> in the 31. of those <hi>Articles,</hi> and that the <hi>Parliament</hi> looked not on it as a point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but as it was a matter <hi>practicall,</hi> conducing to the benefit and improvement of the Common-wealth. Or if it did, yet was the Statute built on no other ground-worke, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the <hi>Clergy, the Marriage of Priests being before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be most lawfull</hi> (I use the very words of the Act it selfe) and <hi>according to the word of God, by the learned</hi> Clergy <hi>of this Realm in their</hi> Convocations, <hi>as well by the common assent, as by subscription of their hands.</hi> 5.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>And, for the time of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> it is most manifest that they had no other body of Doctrine in the first part of her Reigne, then only the said <hi>Articles</hi> of K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s booke, and that which was delivered in the booke of <hi>Homilies</hi> of the said kings time; in which the <hi>Parliament</hi> had as little to doe, as you have seene they had in the booke of <hi>Articles.</hi> But in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the yeare 1562. being the fifth of the Queenes Reigne, the Bishops and <hi>Clergy</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into consideration the said <hi>booke of Articles,</hi> and altering what they thought most fitting, to make it more conducible to the use of the Church, and the edification of the people, presented it unto the Queene, who caused it to be published with this name and Title, <hi>viz. Articles whereupon it was agreed by the Archbishops and Bishops of both</hi> Provinces <hi>and the whole</hi> Clergy <hi>in the</hi> Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>holden at</hi> London <hi>An.</hi> 1562. <hi>for the avoiding of diversitie of opinions, and for establishing of consent touching true</hi> Religion, <hi>put forth by the</hi> Queenes <hi>authority.</hi> Of any thing done or pretended to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54783:13"/>
be done by the power of <hi>Parliament,</hi> either in the way of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or of confirmation, not one word occurres either in any of the printed bookes, or their publique Registers. At last indeed in the thirteenth of the said Queenes Reigne (which was eight yeares full after the passing of those <hi>Articles</hi>) comes out a Statute for <hi>the redressing of disorders in the Ministers of holy Church</hi>; In which it was enacted. <q>That all such as were ordeined <hi>Priests</hi> or Ministers of God's Word and Sacraments, after any other <hi>forme</hi> than that appointed to be used in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; all such as were to be ordeined, or permitted to preach, or to be institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into any <hi>Benefice</hi> with cure of Soules, should publiquely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the said <hi>Articles,</hi> and testifie their assent unto them</q>: which shewes (if you observe it well) that though the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> did well allow of and approve the said <hi>booke of Articles,</hi> yet the said booke owes neither confirmation nor authority to the Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> So that the wonder is the greater, that that most insolent scoffe which is put upon us by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Religion by the name <hi>Parliamentaria Religio,</hi> should passe so long without controle, unlesse perhaps it was in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Formes of worship, of which I am to speake in the next place.</p>
               <p>But first we must make answere unto some objections which are made against us, both from Law and practise. For Practise, first it is alleaged by some out of Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> in his answere to the cavill of Dr. <hi>Harding,</hi> 
                  <q>to be no strange matter to see Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes debated in <hi>Parliament</hi>; and that it is apparent by the Lawes of K. <hi>Inas,</hi> K. <hi>Alfred,</hi> K. <hi>Edward, &amp;c.</hi> That our godly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers the Princes and Peeres of this Realme, never vouchsafed to treate of matters touching the common State, before all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Causes Ecclesiasticall</hi> had beene concluded. <hi>Def. of the Apol. pt.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. §. 1. </q>But the answere unto this is easy. For first, if our <hi>Religion</hi> may be called <hi>Parliamentarian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath received confirmation and debate in <hi>Parliament,</hi> then the Religion of our Forefathers, even <hi>Papistry</hi> it selfe (concerning which so many Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> were made in K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and Q. <hi>Maries</hi> time) must be called <hi>Parliamentarian</hi> also. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is most certaine, that in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> or <hi>Common
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54783:13"/>
Councels</hi> (call them which you will) both of King <hi>Inas</hi> time, and the rest of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings which Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> speakes of, not only <hi>Bishops, Abbats,</hi> and the higher part of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but the whole body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> generally had their votes and suffrages, eyther in person or by Proxy. Concerning which, take this for the leading Case, That in the Parliament or Common Councell in K. <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s time, who first of all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings received the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, the <hi>Clergy</hi> were convened in as full a manner, as the Lay sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The first point which was altered in the publique <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> was that the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Pater-noster,</hi> and the ten <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> were ordered to be said in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the people might be perfect in them, and learn them without book, as our phrase is. The next; the setting forth and using of the <hi>English Letanie,</hi> on such daies and times, in which it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customably to be read as a part of the Service. But neither of these two was done by <hi>Parliament,</hi> nay (to say truth) the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> did nothing in them. All which was done in eyther of them, was only by the Kings authority, by virtue of the <hi>Head ship</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> which was vested in him, eyther cooperating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with his <hi>Convocation,</hi> or else directed and assisted by such learned <hi>Prelates,</hi> with whom he did advise in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Church, and did relate to <hi>Reformation.</hi> By virtue of which <hi>Head-ship</hi> or <hi>Supremacy</hi> he ordained the first, and to that end caused certain <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Injunctions</hi> to be published by the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> then his <hi>Vicar-Generall. An.</hi> 1536. And by the same did he give order for the second, I meane, for the saying of the <hi>Letany</hi> in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, by his own royall <hi>Proclamation. An.</hi> 1545. for which, consult the <hi>Acts</hi> &amp; <hi>Mon. fol.</hi> 1248. 1312. But these were only preparations to a greater worke which was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the times of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. In the beginning of whose Reigne there passed a <hi>Statute</hi> for the <hi>administring the Sacrament in both kindes to any person that should devoutly and humbly desire the same.</hi> 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. In which it is to be observed, that though the <hi>Statute</hi> doe declare, that the ministring of the same in <hi>both kinds</hi> to the people was more agreeable to the first <hi>Institution</hi> of the said Sacrament, and to the common usage of the <hi>primitive</hi> times. Yet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54783:14"/>
Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> assures us (and we may take his word) that they did build that Declaration, and consequently the Act which was raised upon it, <hi>upon the Iudgement and opinion of the best learned men, whose resolution and advise they followed in it. fol.</hi> 1489. And for the <hi>Forme</hi> by which the said most Blessed Sacrament was to be so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Common people, it was commended to the care of the most grave and learned Bishops, and others, assembled by the King at his Castle of <hi>Windsor</hi>; who upon long, wise, learned and deliberate advice did <hi>finally agree</hi> (saith <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>upon one Godly and uniform Order for receiving the same, according to the right rule of Scriptures, and the first use of the primitive Church. fol.</hi> 1491. which Order, as it was set forth in print. <hi>An.</hi> 1548. with a <hi>Proclamation</hi> in the name of the King, to give authority thereunto amongst the people, so was it recommended by especiall Letters writ unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Bishop severally from the Lords of the Counsell, to see the same put in execution; A copy of which Letters you may find in <hi>Fox. fol.</hi> 1491. as afore is said.</p>
               <p>Hitherto nothing done by <hi>Parliament</hi> in the <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> but in the following yeare there was. For the Protector and the rest of the Kings Counsell being fully bent for a <hi>Reformation,</hi> thought it expedient that one uniform, quiet and godly Order should be had throughout the Realm, for Officiating God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service. And <hi>to that end</hi> (I use the very words of the Act it selfe) <hi>appointed the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and certain of the most learned and discreet Bishops, and other learned men of the Realm to meet together, requiring them, that having as well eye and respect to the most pure and sincere</hi> christian Religion <hi>taught in Scriptures, as to the</hi> usages <hi>in the</hi> primitive Church, <hi>they should draw and make one convenient and meet</hi> Order, Rite <hi>and</hi> Fashion <hi>of</hi> Common Prayer, <hi>and Administration of</hi> Sacraments <hi>to be had and used in this his Majesties Realm of</hi> England. Well, what did they being thus assembled? that the Statute tells us: where it is said, that <hi>by the ayd of the holy Ghost</hi> (I pray you marke this well) <hi>and with one u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform agreement they did conclude upon and set forth an</hi> Order, <hi>which they delivered to the Kings Highnesse, in a book entituled, The Booke of Common-Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, after the use of the Church</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54783:15"/>
of <hi>England.</hi> All this was done before the <hi>Parliament</hi> did any thing. But what was done by them at last? Why first, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the most godly travaile of the Kings Highnesse, and the Lord Protector and others of his Highnesse Counsell, in gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the said Bishops and learned men. Secondly, the godly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Orders, Rites and Ceremonies in the said book mentioned. Thirdly, the motives and inducements which inclined the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said learned men to alter those things which were altered, and to reteine those which were reteined; and finally, taking into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the honour of God, and the great quietnesse which by the grace of God would ensue upon it; they gave his Majesty most hearty and lowely thanks for the same, and most humbly prayed him that it <hi>might be ordeined by his</hi> Majesty, <hi>with the assent of the Lords and Commons assembled in</hi> Parliament, <hi>and by authority of the same, that the said</hi> Form of Common-prayer <hi>and none other, after the Feast of</hi> Pentecost <hi>next following, should be used in all this Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Dominions with severall penalties to such, as either should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave</hi> or neglect the same. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. So far the very words of the Act it selfe. By which it evidently appeareth that the two Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> did nothing in the present businesse, but impose that <hi>Form</hi> upon the people, which by the learned and religious <hi>Clergie men</hi> (whom the King appointed thereunto) was agreed upon, and made it <hi>penall</hi> unto such as eyther should deprave the same, or neglect to use it. And thus doth <hi>Poulton</hi> (no meane Lawyer) understand the Statute, who therfore gives no other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to it in his <hi>Abridgement</hi> published in the yeare 1612<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than this <hi>The Penalty for not using uniformity of Service, and Ministration of the Sacraments.</hi> So then, the making of <hi>one uniform Order</hi> of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Divine Service, was the worke of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the making of the <hi>Penalties,</hi> was the worke of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so much for the first Liturgy of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reigne; in which you see how little was done by the authority or power of <hi>Parliament,</hi> so little, that if it had beene lesse, it had been just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But some exceptions being taken against the Liturgy by some of the preciser sort at home, and by <hi>Calvin</hi> abroad, the book was brought under a review: and though it had been framed at first (if the <hi>Parliament</hi> which said so erred not) by <hi>the ayd of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54783:15"/>
holy Ghost himself,</hi> yet to <hi>comply with the curiositie of the</hi> Ministers, and <hi>mistakes of the</hi> People, <hi>rather then for any other weighty cause,</hi> As the Statute 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. it was thought expedient by the King, with the Assent of the Lords and Commons in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> assembled, that the said <hi>Order of Common-Service</hi> should be faithfully and godly perused, explained and made fully perfect.</p>
               <p>Perused and Explained; by whom? Why, questionlesse by those who made it; or else, by those (if they were not the same men) who were appointed by the King to draw up, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> for the use of the Church. And this <hi>Assent</hi> of theirs (for it was no more) was the only part that was ever acted by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in matter of this present nature, save that a Statute passed in the former <hi>Parliament,</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12. unto this effect, <hi>that such Form and manner of making and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Deacons <hi>and other</hi> Ministers <hi>of the</hi> Church (which before I spake of) <hi>as by six Prelates, and six o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of this Realm, learned in Gods Lawes, by the King to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and assigned, shall be devised for that purpose, and set forth under the Great Seale, shall be lawfully used and exercised, and none other.</hi> Where note, that the King only was to nominate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the men, the Bishops and other learned men were to make the book, &amp; that the <hi>Parliament</hi> in a <hi>blinde obedience,</hi> or at the least upon a charitable confidence in the integrity of the men so nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, did confirm that book, before any of their <hi>Members</hi> had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seene it, though afterwards indeed, in the following <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> this book, together with the book of <hi>Common-prayer,</hi> so printed and explained, retained a more formall confirmation, as to the use thereof throughout the kingdome, but in no other respect, for which see the Statute 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1.

All that the <hi>Parliament</hi> did in it; being to put it into the condition in which it stood before in King <hi>Ed.</hi> Reigne, partly by repealing the Repeale of King <hi>Ed.</hi> Statutes, made in the 1 of Q. <hi>Mary cap.</hi> 2. and partly by the adding of some farther penalties on such as did deprave the book, or neglect to use it, or wilfully did absent themselves from their parish-Churches. And for the <hi>Alterations</hi> made therein in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, being small and in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> only, and for the additions of the <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings</hi> at the end of the <hi>Letany,</hi> the Prayer for the Queen and the royall Issue, and the doctrine of the Sacraments at the end of the <hi>Catechisme,</hi> which were not in the book before; they were never referred unto the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but were done only by authority of the Kings <hi>Commission,</hi> and stand in force by virtue only of his <hi>Proclamation,</hi> which you may find before the book, the charge of buying the said book so explained and altered, being layd upon the severall and respective parishes, by no other authority than that of of the eightieth <hi>Canon,</hi> made in <hi>Convocation. An.</hi> 1603. The like may also be affirmed of the <hi>Formes</hi> of Prayer for the <hi>Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration</hi> day of our Kings and Queenes, the Prayer-books for the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and the fifth of <hi>August,</hi> and those which have beene used in all publique <hi>Fasts:</hi> All which, without the help of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> have been composed by the Bishops, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the King.</p>
               <p>Now unto this discourse of the <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> I shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a word or two of the times of <hi>Worship,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daies</hi> observed in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and so observed, that they doe owe that observation cheifely to the Churches power. For whereas it was found in the former times that the number of the holy daies was grown so great, that they became a burden to the common people, and a great hindrance to the thrift and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of the kingdome; there was a <hi>Canon</hi> made in the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. An.</hi> 1536, for cutting off of many superstitious and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54783:16"/>
holy daies, and the reducing them unto the number in which now they stand (save that St. <hi>Georges</hi> day, and <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalens</hi> day, and all the Festivals of the blessed Virgin had their place amongst them) according to which <hi>Canon,</hi> there went out a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory</hi> from the Archibishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to all the Suffragans of his <hi>Province,</hi> respectively to see the same observed in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Diocesses, which is still extant on Record. But being the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church was then in the wane, it was thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to confirm their Acts, and see execution done upon it by the Kings <hi>Injunction</hi>: which did accordingly come forth with this <hi>Form</hi> or preamble, That the <hi>abolishing of the said holy daies was Decreed, ordained and established by the kings Highnesse Authority, as supreme Head in Earth of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>with the common consent and assent of the</hi> Prelates <hi>and</hi> Clergy <hi>of this his Realm, in Convocation lawfully assembled and Congregate,</hi> Of which see <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments fol.</hi> 1246.1247. Afterwards in the yeare 1541. The King perceiving with what difficulty the People were induced to leave off those <hi>holy daies,</hi> to which they had been so long accustomed, published his <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the twenty third of Iuly, for the abolishing of such <hi>holy daies</hi> (amongst other things) as were prohibited before by his <hi>Injunctions</hi>: both built upon the same foundation, namely, the resolution of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so it stood untill the Reigne of King <hi>E.</hi> 6. at what time the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the publique <hi>Liturgy</hi> drew after it by consequence an alteration in the present businesse, no daies being to be kept or accounted <hi>holy,</hi> but those for which the Church had set apart a peculiar office, and not all those neither. For, whereas there are severall and peculiar offices for the day of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the day of St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apostles; neither of these are kept as <hi>holy daies,</hi> nor reckoned or esteemed as such in the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> wherein the names and number of the <hi>holy daies</hi> is precisely specified, which makes some think the Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> to have had an over-ruling power on the <hi>Common-prayer Book</hi>; but it is not so, there being a specification of the <hi>holy daies</hi> in the book it selfe, with this direction, <hi>These to be observed for holy daies and none other</hi>; in which the Feasts of the <hi>Conversion of St. Paul,</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54783:17"/>
the Apostle <hi>Barnabas</hi> are omitted plainly, and upon which specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Stat. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which concerns the <hi>holy daies</hi> seemes most exprestly to be built. And for the <hi>Offices</hi> on those daies in the <hi>Common-prayer Book,</hi> you may please to know that every <hi>holy-day</hi> consisteth of two speciall parts, that is to say, Rest, or cessation from bodily labour, and celebration of Diuine or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties; and that the dayes before remembred are so far kept holy, as to have still their proper and peculiar <hi>Offices,</hi> which is observed in all the <hi>Cathedralls</hi> of this kingdome, and the <hi>Chappels Royall,</hi> where the service is read every day; and in most Parish churches also as oft as eyther of them fals upon a <hi>Sunday,</hi> though the people be not on those daies enjoyned to rest from bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, no more then on the <hi>Coronation day,</hi> or the fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which yet are reckoned by the people for a kind of <hi>holy daies.</hi> Put all which hath been said together, and the summe is this, That the proceedings of this Church in the Reformation were not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Regall,</hi> (as it is objected by some <hi>Puritans</hi>) much lesse that they were <hi>Parliamentarian</hi> in so great a work, as the <hi>Papists</hi> falsely charge upon us, the <hi>Parliaments</hi> for the most part doing little in it, but that they were directed in a justifiable way, the worke being done <hi>Synodically,</hi> by the <hi>Clergie</hi> only, according to the usage of the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, the King concurring with them, and corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what they had resolved on, eyther by his own single Act in his Letters Patent, <hi>Proclamations</hi> and <hi>Injunctions,</hi> or by some publique Act of State, as in times, and by Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi>

And thirdly, by the sole authority of the Soveraigne Prince, according to the Precedents laid down in the book of God, and the best ages of the Church. Concerning which you must remember what was said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54783:18"/>
Statutes which concern the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> are <hi>Declaratory</hi> of an old Power only, not <hi>introductory</hi> of a new; which said, we shall the better see whether the <hi>Parliament</hi> have had any thing to doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in making <hi>Canons,</hi> or prescribing Orders for the regulating of <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> matters, and unto whom the same doth of right belong according to the Lawes of the Realm of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first, King <hi>Henry</hi> being restored to his <hi>Head-ship</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> (call it which you will) did not conceive himself so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in it (though at first much enamor'd of it) as not some times to take his <hi>Convocation</hi> with him, but at all times to be advised by his <hi>Prelates,</hi> when he had any thing to doe that concerned the Church; for which there had been no provision made by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons,</hi> grounding most times, his <hi>Edicts</hi> and <hi>Injunctions</hi> Royall, upon their advise and resolution. For on this ground, I mean the judgement and conclusions of his <hi>Convocation,</hi> did he set out the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of the yeare 1536. for the abolishing of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and superfluous holy daies, the exterminating of the Popes authority, the publishing of the book of Articles, which before we spake of num, 8. by all Parsons, Vicars and Curats; for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching down the use of Images, Reliques, Pilgrimages and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Miracles; for rehearsing openly in the Church, in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish tongue,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Pater-noster,</hi> and the ten <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; for the due and reverent ministring of the Sacraments and Sacramentals, for providing <hi>English Bibles</hi> to be set up in every Church for the use of the people; for the regular and sober life of <hi>Clergy</hi> men, and the releefe of the poore. And on the other side the King proceeded some times only by the advice of his <hi>Prelates,</hi> as in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of the yeare 1538. for quarterly Sermons in each Parish; for admitting none to preach but men sufficiently Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed: for keeping a Register book of Christnings, Weddings and Burialls; for the due paying of Tythes, as had been accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: for the abolishing of the commemoration of <hi>St. Tho. Becket</hi>: for singing <hi>Parce nobis Domine,</hi> instead of <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> and the like to these. And of this sort were the <hi>Injunctions</hi> which came out in some yeares succeeding, for the taking away of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Reliques,</hi> with all the Ornaments of the same: and all the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and writings of fained Miracles, and for restraint of offering
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54783:18"/>
or setting up lights in any Church, but only to the <hi>Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar,</hi> in which he was directed chiefly by Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>: as also those for eating of white-meates in the time of Lent, the abolishing the fast on <hi>St. Marks</hi> day, and the ridiculous (but superstitious) sports, accustomably used on the dayes of <hi>Saint Clement, St. Catherine</hi> and <hi>St. Nicholas.</hi> All which and more was done in the said Kings Reigne without help of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For which I shall refer you to the <hi>Acts &amp; Mon. fol.</hi> 1385. 1425. 1441. The like may also be affirmed of the <hi>Injunctions</hi> published in the name of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>An.</hi> 1547. and printed also then for the use of the Subjects: and of the severall Letters missive which went forth in his name, prohibiting the bearing of Candles on <hi>Candlemas</hi> day: of Ashes in <hi>Lent,</hi> and of Palmes on <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi>: for the taking down of all the Images throughout the kingdom: for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Communion in both kinds, dated <hi>March</hi> 13. 1548. for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogating of private Masses <hi>Iun.</hi> 24. 1549. for bringing in all <hi>Missals, Graduals, Processionals, Legends</hi> and <hi>Ordinals,</hi> about the latter end of December of the same yeare: for taking down of Altars and setting up Tables instead thereof <hi>An.</hi> 1550. and the like to these: All which particulars you have in <hi>Foxes</hi> book of <hi>Acts &amp; Mon.</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> life, which whether they were done of the Kings meer motion, or by advice of his Counsell, or by consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with his Bishops (for there is little left upon Record of the <hi>Convocations</hi> of that time, more than the <hi>Articles</hi> of the yeare 1552) certain I am that there was nothing done, nor yet pretended to be done in all these particulars, by the authority of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus also in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, before the new Bishops were well setled, and the Queen assured of the affections of her <hi>Clergy</hi> she went that way to work in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which not only her two Predecessors, but all the godly Kings and Princes in the <hi>Iewish</hi> State, and many of the <hi>Christian</hi> Emperours in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> times had done before her, in the well ordering of the Church and People committed to their care and government by Almighty God. And to that end she published her <hi>Injunctions An.</hi> 1559. A <hi>book of Orders An.</hi> 1561. Another of <hi>Advertisements An.</hi> 1562. all tending nnto <hi>Reformation,</hi> unto the building up of the <hi>new Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> with the advise no doubt of some godly <hi>Prelates,</hi> as were then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54783:19"/>
about her. But past all doubt, without the least concurrence of her Court of <hi>Parliament.</hi> But when the times were better setled, and the first difficulties of her Reigne passed over, she left <hi>Church-work</hi> to the disposing of <hi>Church-men,</hi> who by their place and calling were most proper for it. And they being met in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and thereto authorized as the Lawe required, did make and publish se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall books of <hi>Canons,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> 1571. <hi>An.</hi> 1584. <hi>An.</hi> 1597. Which being confirmed by the Queene under the broad Seale of <hi>England,</hi> were in force of <hi>Lawes</hi> to all intents and purposes, which they were first made; but being confirmed without those formall words, <hi>Her Heires</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> are not binding now, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired together with the Queene. No Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> required to confirm them then, nor never required ever since on the like occasion. A fuller evidence whereof we cannot have, then in the <hi>Canons</hi> of the yeare 1603. being the first yeare of King <hi>Iames,</hi> made by the <hi>Clergy</hi> only in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and confirmed only by the King. For, though the <hi>old Canons</hi> were in force, which had been made before the <hi>Submission of the Clergy</hi> as before I shewed you, which served in all these wavering and unsetled times for the perpetuall standing rule of the Churches Government; yet many new emergent Cases did require new Rules, and whilest there is a possibility of <hi>mali mores,</hi> there will be a necessity of <hi>bonae Leges.</hi> Now in the Confirmation of these <hi>Canons</hi> we shall find it thus, That the <hi>Clergy</hi> being met in their <hi>Convocation</hi> according to the Tenour and effect of his Majesties Writ, <q>his Majesty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by virtue of his <hi>Prerogative Royall</hi> and <hi>Supreme authority</hi> in Causes <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> to give and grant unto them by his Letters Patents dated <hi>Apr.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp; Iun.</hi> 25. full, free, and lawfull liberty, licence, power, and authority, to confer, treate, debate, consider, consult, and agree upon such <hi>Canons, Orders, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi> as they should think necessary, fit, and convenient, for the honour and service of Almighty God, the good and quiet of the Church, and the better Government thereof from time to time, &amp;c. to be kept by all persons within this Realm, as far as lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being members of the Church, it may concern them: which being agreed on by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and by them presented to the King, humbly requiring him to give his Royall assent unto them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54783:19"/>
to the Statute made in the 25. of K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and by his Majesties Prerogative and Supreme authority in Ecclesiasticall Causes, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and confirm the same: his Majesty was graciously pleased to confirm and ratifie them by his Letters Patents, for Himselfe, his Heires and lawfull Successours; straitly commanding and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his loving Subjects, diligently to observe, execute and keep the same in all points, wherein they doe or may concern all or any of them</q>. No running to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to confirm these <hi>Canons,</hi> nor any question made till this present, by temperate and knowing men, that there wanted any Act for their confirmation, which the Lawe could give them.</p>
               <p>But against this, and all which hath been said before, it will be objected, That being the Bishops of the Church are fully and wholly <hi>Parliamentarian,</hi> and have no more authority and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>nisi a Parliamentis derivatam,</hi> but that which is conferred upon them by the power of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as both <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Schultingius</hi> doe expresly say; whatsoever they shall doe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon, either in <hi>Convocation,</hi> or in private <hi>Conferences,</hi> may be called <hi>Parliamentarian</hi> also. And this last calumny they build on the severall Statutes 24. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>touching the manner of electing and Consecrating Archbishops and Bishops.</hi> that of the 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>appointing how they shall be chosen, and what Seales they shall use.</hi> those of the 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12. and 5 <hi>&amp;</hi> 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>for authorising of the book of Ordination.</hi> But chiefly that of the 8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good all Acts since 1 <hi>Eliz. in consecrating any Archbishop or Bishop within this Realm.</hi> To give a generall answer to each seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cavill, you may please to know; that the Bishops, as they now stand in the Church of <hi>England</hi> derive their Calling together with their Authority and Power in <hi>Spirituall</hi> matters, from no other hands, than those of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> their <hi>Temporall</hi> honors and possessions, from the bounty and affection only of our Kings and Princes; their <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Jurisdiction in Causes <hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, Testamentary</hi> and the like, for which no Action lieth at the <hi>Common-Lawe,</hi> from continuall usage and prescription; and owe no more unto the <hi>Parliament</hi> than all sort of Subjects doe besides, whose fortunes and Estates have been occasionally and collaterally confirmed in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And as for the particular Statutes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54783:20"/>
which are touched upon, that of the 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth only constitute and ordain a way by which they might be chose and consecrated, without recourse to <hi>Rome</hi> for a <hi>confirmation,</hi> which formerly had put the Prelates to great charge and trouble: but for the <hi>Form</hi> and manner of their <hi>Consecration,</hi> the Statute leaves it to those <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> wherewith before it was performed; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Sanders</hi> doth not stick to affirm, that all the Bishops which were made in King <hi>Henries</hi> dayes were Lawfully and Canonically ordained and Consecrated, the Bishops of that time, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken and acknowledged in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, for lawfull and Canonicall Bishops, but called on to assist at the Consecration of such other Bishops (<hi>Cardinall Poole</hi> himselfe for one) as were promoted in her Reigne, whereof see <hi>Mason</hi>'s book <hi>de Minist. Ang. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c..</hi> Next for the Statute 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. besides that it is satisfied in part by the former Answer as it relates to their <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Consecrations,</hi> it was repealed in <hi>Terminis</hi> in the first of Q. <hi>Maries</hi> Reigne, and never stood in force nor practice to this day. That of the authorizing of the book of <hi>Ordination</hi> in two severall <hi>Parliaments</hi> of that King, the one <hi>a parte antè,</hi> and the other <hi>a parte pòst,</hi> as before I told you, might indeed seem somewhat to the purpose, if any thing were wanting in it which had been used in the formula's of the <hi>Primitive times</hi>; or if the book had been composed in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or by <hi>Parliament men,</hi> or otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more Authority from them, then that it might be lawfully used and exercised throughout the Kingdom. But it is plain that none of these things were objected in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, when the <hi>Papists</hi> stood most upon their points, the <hi>Ordinall</hi> not being called in, because it had too much of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but because it had too little of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and relished too strongly of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Piety. And for the Statute of the 8 of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is cheifly stood on, all that was done therein was no more than this, and on this occasion. A question had been made by captious and unquiet men, and amongst the rest by Dr. <hi>Bonner,</hi> sometimes Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London,</hi> whether the Bishops of those times were lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained, or not; the reason of the doubt being this (which I mervaile <hi>Mason</hi> did not see) because the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> which was annulled and abrogated in the first of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> had not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54783:20"/>
been yet restored, and revived by any legall Act of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time: which Cause being brought before the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the 8. yeare of her Reigne, the <hi>Parliament</hi> took notice first, that their not restoring of that book to the former Power in Termes signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and expresse, was but <hi>Casus omissus</hi>; and then declare that by the Statute 5 <hi>&amp;</hi> 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. It had been added to the Book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer,</hi> and Administration of the Sacraments, as a member of it, at least as an Appendant to it, and therefore by the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. was restored againe together with the said book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> intentionally at the least, if not in <hi>Terminis.</hi> But being the words in the said Statute were not cleare enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all doubts, they therefore did revive it now, and did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly enact, that <hi>whatsoever had been done by virtue of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, should be good in Lawe.</hi> This is the Totall of the Statute, and this shewes rather in my judgement, that the Bishops of the Queenes first times had too little of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in them, then that they were conceived to have had too much. And so I come to your last objection which concernes the <hi>Parliament,</hi> whose enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning all occasions to manifest their power in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doth seem to you to make that groundles slander of the <hi>Papists</hi> the more faire and plausible.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that many <hi>Members</hi> of both Houses in these latter times, have been very ready to imbrace all businesses which are offered to them, cut of a probable hope of drawing the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of all Affaires as well <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> as <hi>Civill</hi> into their own hands: and some there are who being they cannot hope to have their fancies authorised in a <hi>Regular</hi> way, doe put them upon such designes, as neither can consist with the nature of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> nor the esteem and reputation of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> And this hath been a practice even as old as <hi>Wicklef,</hi> who in the time of K. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. addressed his Petition to the <hi>Parliament</hi> (as we reade in <hi>Walsingham</hi>) for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the rooting out of many false and erroneous Tenents, and for establishing of his own Doctrines (who though he had some <hi>Wheat,</hi> had more <hi>Tares</hi> by ods) in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; lest he might be thought to have gone a way, as dangerous and unjustifiable, as it was strange and new, he laid it down for a Position, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54783:21"/>
Lords</hi> (where by the way, this ascribes no authority or power at all to the <hi>House of Commons</hi>) might lawfully examine and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> the <hi>Disorders</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and on discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the errors and corruptions of it, devest her of all Titles and Temporall endowments, till she were <hi>reformed.</hi> But for all this, and (more than this) for all he was so strongly backed by the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> neither his <hi>Petition</hi> nor his <hi>Position</hi> found any wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> further than that it made them cast many a longing eye on the <hi>Churches Patrimony,</hi> or produced any other effect towards the worke of <hi>Reformation,</hi> which he chiefly aymed at, then that it hath since served for a <hi>Precedent</hi> to <hi>Penry, Pryn,</hi> and such like turbulent <hi>Innovators</hi> to disturbe the <hi>Church,</hi> and set on foot those dreames and dotages, which otherwise they durst not publish. And to say truth, as long as the <hi>Clergy</hi> were in power, and had authority in <hi>Convocation</hi> to doe what they would in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which concern'd <hi>Religion,</hi> those of the <hi>Parliament</hi> conceived it neither safe nor fitting to intermeddle in such businesse as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the <hi>Clergy,</hi> for feare of being questioned for it at the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> barre. But when that power was lessen'd, if it were not lost, by the <hi>Submission</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> to K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the Act of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> which ensued upon it; then did the <hi>Parliaments</hi> begin to intrench upon the <hi>Church</hi>'s Rights, to offer at and enterteine such businesses, as formerly were held peculiar to the <hi>Clergy</hi> only; next, to dispute their <hi>Charters,</hi> and reverse their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and finally to impose some hard Lawes upon them: Of which <hi>Matt. Parker</hi> thus complaines in the life of <hi>Cranmer, Qua Ecclesiasticarum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum potestate abdicata, populus in</hi> Parliamento <hi>coepit de rebus divinis inconsulto</hi> Clero <hi>Sancire, tum absentis Cleri privilegia sensim detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, juraque duriora quibus</hi> Clerus <hi>invitus teneretur, constituere.</hi> But these were only <hi>tentamenta,</hi> offers and undertakings only, and no more than so. Neither the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of K. <hi>Edward,</hi> or <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> times knew what it was to make <hi>Committees for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or thought it fit that <hi>Vzzah</hi> should support the <hi>Arke,</hi> though he saw it tottering. That was a worke belonging to the <hi>Levites</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, none of the other <hi>Tribes</hi> were to meddle with it. But as the <hi>Puritan faction</hi> grew more strong and active, so they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more openly to the Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but specially to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54783:21"/>
the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> putting all power into their hands as well in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall Causes,</hi> as in matters <hi>Temporall.</hi> This, amongst others, confidently affirmed by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> in the Epistle to his book called <hi>Anti-Arminianisme,</hi> where he averres, that <hi>all our Bishops, our Ministers, our Sacraments, our Consecration, our Articles of Religion, our Homilies, Common-Prayer-book, yea and all the Religion of our Church, is no other way publiquely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, supported, or established amongst us, but by Acts of Parliament.</hi> And this not only since the time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Church affaires were determined, ratified, declared and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Act of Parliament, and no wayes else, even then when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Church-men had the greatest sway.</hi> Which strange asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion falling from the Pen of so great a <hi>Scribe,</hi> was forthwith cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received amongst our <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who hoped to have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est places, not only in the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> but the Court of <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> advancing the authority of <hi>Parliaments</hi> to so high a pitch, that by degrees they fastned on them, both an <hi>infallibility</hi> of judgement, and an <hi>omnipotency</hi> of Power. Nor can it be denied (to deale truly with you) but that they met with many apt Schollers in that house, who eyther out of a desire to bring all the grist to their own Mill, or willing to enlarge the great power of <hi>Parliaments</hi> by making new <hi>Precedents</hi> for Posteritie, or out of faction, or affection, or what else you please, began to put their Rules in practise, and draw all matters whatsoever within the cognizance of that Court; In w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> their embracements were at last so generall, and that humour in the House so prevalent, that one being once demanded what they did amongst them, returned this Answer, <hi>That they were making a new Creed</hi>: Another being heard to say, <hi>That he could not be quiet in his Conscience, till the holy Text should be confirmed by an Act of Theirs,</hi> which passages if they be not true and reall (as I have them from an honest hand) I assure you they are bitter jests. But this, although indeed it be the sicknesse and disease of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times, aud little to the honour of the Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> can be no prejudice at all to the Cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> or to the way and meanes of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> amongst sober and discerning men: the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> being setled, the <hi>Liturgie</hi> published and confirmed, the <hi>Canons</hi> authorized and executed, when no such
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54783:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
humor was predominant, nor no such Power pretended to, by both or eyther of the Houses of the High Court of <hi>Parliament.</hi>

Which if it may be serviceable to your selfe, or others, whom the like doubts and prejudices have possessed or scrupled, it is all I wish: my studies and endeavors ayming at no other end, then to doe all the service I can possibly to the <hi>Church</hi> of God; to whose Graces and divine Protection you are most heartily commended in our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. by</p>
