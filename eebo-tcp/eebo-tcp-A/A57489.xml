         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there's something so happily express'd, the Graces are so numerous, yet so unaffected, that I don't wonder why all the Original Touches of so incomparable a Master, have been enquired after, with so Publick and General a Concern. Most of his other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, especially those in Verse, have long ago bless'd the Publick, and were received with Vniversal Delight and Admiration, which gives me Encouragement to believe, that his Letters will find the like Reception. Tho' most of them were written upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Occasions, to an Honourable Person who was happy in his Lordship's Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with no intention to be ever made publick; yet that constant good Sence, which is all along visible in them, the Iustice of the Observations, and the peculiar Beauties of the Style, are Reasons sufficient, why they should no longer be conceal'd in private Hands.

            <p>As for the Letters by other Hands, that make up this Volume, some of them were written by Gentlemen, that are wholly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to me, and others belong to those that are so much better known in the World than myself, that I can say nothing upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but what falls vastly short of their Merit. But I cannot forbear to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Mr. <hi>Otway</hi>'s: They have that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable Tenderness in them, that I dare op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to any thing of Antiquity; I am sure few of the present Age can pretend to come up to them. The Passions, in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of which, he had a Felicity peculiar to himself, are represented in such lively Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that they cannot fail of affecting the most insensible Hearts, with pleasing Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. I cou'd wish we had more Pieces of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the same Hand, for I profess an intire Veneration to his Memory, and always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him as the only Person, almost, that
<pb facs="tcp:37805:4"/>
knew the secret Springs and Sources of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and made a true use of them. Love, as it is generally managed by other Hands, is either raving and enthusiastical, or else dull and languishing: In him alone 'tis true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and at the same time inspires us with Compassion and Delight. After this, I will not venture to say any thing of my own Trifles that bring up the Rear. Some of 'em were written long ago, and now huddled in haste; the rest had a little more Care and Labour bestow'd upon them. If they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in the least to your Entertainment, which was my only Design in publishing them, I have attain'd my Ends: I have some others by me, which I may, perhaps, publish hereafter, if these meet with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Success.</p>
            <p>I need not, and I am sure I cannot make you a better Panegyrick than to acquaint the World, that you were happy in my Lord <hi>Rochester</hi>'s Friendship, that he took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in your Conversation, of which even his Enemies must allow him to have been the best Iudge, and that in the Politest Reign we can boast of in <hi>England.</hi> The Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of so impartial a Iudge, who was, in his Time, a Scourge to all Blockheads, by what Names or Titles soever dignisied, or
<pb facs="tcp:37805:4"/>
distinguish'd, is above all the Incense that a much better Hand than mine can presume to offer: Shou'd I put out all the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sails, as 'tis the way of most Authors, I cou'd soon erect you into a great Hero, and Deliverer; and tell how often you have triumph'd over inveterate Distempers, and restor'd the Sick to that only Blessing, that makes Life supportable. I cou'd tell how, by your single Merit, you have ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>led a Faction form'd against you with equal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Ignorance; I cou'd tell what Marks of Munisicence you have left behind you, in the Place that was honour'd with your Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and how generously ready you are to serve your Friends upon all Occasions. But after all, the highest thing I will pretend to say of you her is, That you were esteem'd, and valu'd, and lov'd by my Lord <hi>Rochester.</hi> 'Tis true, as there never was any Conspicuous Merit in the World, that had not, like <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> Monsters to encounter, so you have had your share of them; but, Heaven be prais'd, your Enemies, with all their vain Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, have only served to six your Interest, and advance your Reputation: Tho' I know you hear of nothing with more Vneasiness, than of the Favours you do; yet I cannot omit to tell, and indeed I am vain upon it,
<pb facs="tcp:37805:5"/>
that you have condescended so low, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert those Hours you cou'd steal from the Publick, with some of my Trifles, that you have been pleased to think favourably of them, and rewarded them. For all which Obligations, I had no other way of expressing my Gratitude but this; which, I am afraid will but inflame the Reckoning, instead of paying any part of the Debt: But this has been the constant Vsage in all Ages of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus,</hi> and, like Senators that take Bribes, we have Antiquity and Vniversality to plead in our Excuse. But I forget that you are all this while in pain, till the Dedication re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leases you: Therefore I have nothing but my Wishes to add, That you, who have been so happy a Restorer of Health to others, may ever enjoy it yourself, that your Days may be always pleasant, and your Nights easie, and that you'll be pleas'd to forgive this Presumption in</p>

            <head>THE Bookseller's Preface.</head>
            <p>HAving, by the Assistance of a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend, procured the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters that were written by the late Incomparable Earl of <hi>Rochester</hi> (the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of all which I preserve by me, to satisfie those Gentlemen, who may have the Curiosity to see them under his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's hand) I was encouraged to trouble others of my Friends, that had any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their Custody, to make this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which I now publish.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Letters that were written by the abovemention'd Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, have something so happy in the Manner and Stile, that I need not lose my Time to convince the World they are genuine. I may say the same of Mr. <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>'s Letters, that they are full of Life and
<pb facs="tcp:37805:6"/>
Passion, and sufficiently discover their Author. And that this Collection might be compleat, I got some that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Fam'd <hi>Orinda,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Katherine Phillips,</hi> to be added to the rest; together with others by some Gentlemen now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that the Reader might have a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Entertainment.</p>
            <p>Our Neighbouring Nations, whom I don't believe we come short of in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, have printed several Volumes of Letters, which meet with publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; I am satisfied, that if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>England</hi> wou'd be as free, and Communicative to part with theirs, we might show as great a Number, and as good a Choice as they have done. It has been used as an Objection against pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing things of this Nature, That, if they are written as they ought to be, they shou'd never be made publick. But I hope this Collection will disarm that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for tho' the Reader may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand every particular Passage, yet there are other things in them that will make him sufficient Amends.</p>
            <p>I have only a word more to add: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Noise of this Collection, several Gentlemen have been so kind, as to send
<pb facs="tcp:37805:6"/>
me in Materials to compose a Second, which is now printed; and, on the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Second, I have procured as many of the Lord <hi>Rochester</hi>'s the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Etheridge,</hi> which will almost make a third Vol. which if I can compleat, it shall be publish'd next <hi>Trinity-Term</hi>; and therefore those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that have any Curious Letters by them, written by those Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and are willing to oblige the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by letting them come abroad, are desired to send them to me, who will take care to have them faithfully Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd for the Press, and Printed in the third Vol. which will be intirely theirs, and no modern one mixt with them.</p>

               <p>YOU cannot shake off the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man intirely; for, I perceive, you have no Opinion of a Letter, that is not almost a Gazette: Now, to me, who think the World as giddy as my self, I care not which way it turns, and am fond of no News, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of my Friends, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their Kindness to me, which is the only Error I wish to continue in 'em: For my own part, I am not at all stung with my Lord <hi>M</hi>—'s mean Ambition, but I aspire to my Lord <hi>L</hi>—'s generous Philosophy: They who would be great in our little Government, seem as ridiculous to me as School-boys, who, with much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and some danger, climb a Crab-tree, venturing their Necks for Fruit, which solid Pigs would disdain, if they

And now, Dear <hi>Harry,</hi> if it may agree with your Affairs, to shew yourself in the Country this Summer, contrive such a Crew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as may not be asham'd of passing by <hi>Woodstock</hi>; and, if you can debauch Alderman <hi>G—y,</hi> we will make a shift to delight his Gravity.

               <p>IF it were the Sign of an honest Man, to be happy in his Friends, sure I were mark'd out for the worst of Men; since no one e'er lost so many as I have done, or knew to make so few. The Severity you say the Dutchess of <hi>P</hi>— shews to me, is a proof, that 'tis not in my power to deserve well of Any-body; since (I call Truth to Witness) I have never been guilty of an Errour, that I know, to her: And this may be a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, that remain in the Mistake of being kind to me, never to expect a grateful Return; since I am so utterly ignorant how to make it: To value you in my Thoughts, to prefer you in my Wishes, to serve you in my Words; to observe, study, and obey you in all my Actions, is too little; since I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all this to her, without so much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37805:25"/>
as an offensive Accident. And yet she thinks it just, to use me ill. If I were not malicious enough to hope she were in the wrong; I must have a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Opinion of myself. I wish your Interest might prevail with her, as a Friend of her's, not mine, to tell how I have deserv'd it of her, since she has ne'r accus'd me of any Crime, but of being Cunning; and I told her, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had been Cunninger than I, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade her so. I can as well support the Hatred of the whole World, as Any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, not being generally fond of it. Those whom I have oblig'd, may use me with Ingratitude, and not afflict me much: But to be injur'd by those who have oblig'd me, and to whose Service I am ever bound; is such a Curse, as I can only wish on them who wrong me to the Dutchess.</p>
               <p>I hope you have not forgot what <hi>G—y</hi> and you have promis'd me; but within some time you will come and fetch me to <hi>London:</hi> I shall scarce think of coming, till you call me, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many prevalent Motives to draw me to the Court, if it be so that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

has no need of my Service, nor my Friends of my Company.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi> is a Man of a fluent Stile and coherent Thought; if, as I suspect, he writ your Postscript.</p>

A Foreign Prince ought to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self like a Kite, who is allow'd to take one Royal Chick for his Reward; but then 'tis expected, before he leaves the Country, his Flock shall clear the whole Parish of all the Garbage and Carrion many Miles about.

I ever thought you an extraordinary Man, and must now think you such a Friend, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Courtier, as you are, can love a Man whom it is the great Mode to hate. Catch Sir <hi>G. H.</hi> or Sir <hi>Carr,</hi> at such an ill-bred Proceeding, and I am mistaken: For the hideous Deportment, which you have heard of, concerning running naked, so much is true, that

we went into the River somewhat late in the Year, and had a Frisk for forty Yards in the Meadow, to dry our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. I will appeal to the King and the Duke, If they had not done as much; nay, may Lord-Chancellor and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops both, when they were School-boys? And, at these Years, I have heard the one Declaim'd like <hi>Cicero,</hi> the others Preach'd like St. <hi>Austin</hi>: Prudenter Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I conclude, they were, ev'n in Hanging-sleeves, than any of the flashy Fry, (of which I must own myself the most unsolid) can hope to appear, ev'n in their ripest Manhood.</p>
               <p>And now, (Mr. <hi>Savile</hi>) since you are pleas'd to quote yourself for a grave Man of the Number of the Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd, be pleas'd to call to mind the Year 1676, when two large fat Nudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties led the Coranto round <hi>Rosamond</hi>'s fair Fountain, while the poor violated Nymph wept to behold the strange De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Manly Parts, since the Days of her dear <hi>Harry</hi> the Second: P— ('tis confess'd) you shew'd but little of; but for A— and B—, (a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier

What ill Star reigns over me, that I'm still mark'd out for Ingratitude, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly us'd barbarously to those I am oblig'd to! Had I been troublesom to her in pinning the Dependance of my Fortune upon her Solicitations to the King, or her Unmerited Recommendations of me to some Great Man; it would not have mov'd my Wonder much, if she had sought any Occasion to be rid of a use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Trouble: But, a Creature, who had already receiv'd of her all the Obligations

he ever could pretend to, except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her good Opinion, for the which he resolv'd, and did direct every step of his Life in Duty and Service to her, and all who were concern'd in her; why should she take the Advantage of a false idle Story, to hate such a Man; as if it were an Inconvenience to her to be harmless, or a Pain to continue just? By that God that made me, I have no more offended her in Thought, Word, or Deed, no more imagin'd or utter'd the least Thought to her Contempt or Prejudice, than I have plotted Treason, conceal'd Arms, Train'd Regiments for a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.

thing I will ever say of her. For her generous Resolution of not hurting me to the King, I thank her; but she must think a Man much oblig'd, after the calling of him Knave, to say she will do him no farther Prejudice. For the Countess of <hi>P</hi>—, whatever she has heard me say, or any body else, of her, I'll stand the Test of any impartial Judge, 'twas neither injurious nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly; and how severe soever she pleases to be, I have always been her humble Servant, and will continue so. I do not know how to assure myself the D. will spare me to the King, who would not to you; I'm sure she can't say I ever injur'd you to her; nor am I at all afraid she can hurt me with you; I dare swear you don't think I have dealt so indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly in my Service to her, as to doubt me in the Friendship I profess to you. And, to shew you I rely upon yours, let me beg of you to talk once more with her, and desire her to give me the fair hearing she wou'd afford any Footman of hers, who had been complain'd of to her by a less-worthy Creature, (for such a one, I assure myself, my Accuser is) unless it be for her Service, to wrong the most

I will tell you some Passages, and you shall do well to clear yourself of them. It is said, That the University of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> brought their <hi>Album</hi> unto you, desiring you to write something therein, and that you did <hi>scribere in Albo</hi> these words,

Why, 'twas the justest and bravest Action that ever was done in</hi> England, <hi>or any where else</hi>; with other words to the same effect. It is said also, That you having heard of a Design to seize upon you, or to cause you to be taken Prisoner, you took notice of it to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> himself, and said, <hi>I hear there is a Design to seize upon me: But who is it that hath that Design?</hi> Est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have not seen Mr. <hi>Pedcombe</hi> since; but, within a few Days I will put him in mind of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Friendship to you, and try what he can or will do.

            <head>The Honourable <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi>'s LETTER, AGAINST BRIBERY, AND Arbitrary Government. Written to his Friends, in Answer to Theirs, perswading his Return to England.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am sorry I cannot in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form myself to the Advices of my Friends; if theirs had any joint concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with mine, I would willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37805:38"/>
my Interest to theirs; but when I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone am interested, and they only advise me to come over as soon as the Act of Indemnity is pass'd, because they think it is best for me, I cannot wholly lay aside my own Judgment and Choice. I confess, we are naturally inclin'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in our own Country, and I have a particular Love to mine; I hope I have given some Testimony of it; I think that being exil'd from it is a great Evil, and would redeem myself from it with the loss of a great deal of my Blood: But when that Country of mine, which us'd to be esteem'd a Paradise, is now like to be made a Stage of Injury, the Liberty which we hoped to establish oppress'd, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Prophaneness, Loosness, Luxury and Lewdness set up in its heighth; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Piety, Virtue, Sobriety, and Modesty, which we hoped God, by our Hands, would have introduc'd; the Best of our Nation made a Prey to the Worst; the Parliament, Court and Army corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the People enslav'd, all things ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and no Man safe, but by such evil and infamous Means as Flattery and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery; what Joy can I have in my own Country in this Condition? Is it a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37805:39"/>
to see all that I love in the World sold and destroy'd? Shall I renounce all my old Principles, learn the vile Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts, and make my Peace by bribing some of them? Shall their Corruption and Vice be my Safety? Ah! no; better is a Life among Strangers, than in my own Country upon such Conditions. Whil'st I live, I will endeavour to preserve my Liberty; or, at least, not consent to the destroying of it. I hope I shall die in the same Principle in which I have lived, and will live no longer than they can preserve me. I have in my Life been guilty of many Follies, but, as I think of no meanness, I will not blot and defile that which is past, by endeavouring to provide for the future. I have ever had in my Mind, that when God should cast me into such a Condition, as that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save my Life, but by doing an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing, He shews me the time is come wherein I should resign it. And when I cannot live in my own Country, but by such means as are worse than dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, I think He shews me, I ought to keep myself out of it. Let them please themselves with <hi>making the King glorious,</hi> who think a <hi>Whole People</hi> may justly be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37805:39"/>
sacrific'd for the Interest and Pleasure of <hi>One Man,</hi> and <hi>a few of his Followers:</hi> Let them rejoice in their Subtilty, who, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the former, Powers, have gain'd the Favour of this, not only preserv'd, but advanc'd themselves in these dangerous Changes. Nevertheless (perhaps) they may find the King's Glory is their Shame, his Plenty the Peoples Misery; and that the gaining of an Office, or a little Mony, is a poor Reward for destroying a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! (which, if it were preserved in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Vertue, would truly be the most glorious in the World) and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may find they have, with much Pains, purchas'd their own Shame and Misery, a dear Price paid for that which is not worth keeping, nor the Life that is accompanied with it; the Honour of <hi>English</hi> Parliaments have ever been in making the Nation glorious and happy, not in selling and destroying the Interest of it, to satisfie, the Lusts of one Man. Miserable Nation! that, from so great a heighth of Glory, is fallen into the most despicable Condition in the World, of having all its Good depending upon the Breath and Will of the vilest Persons in it! cheated and sold by them they trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!

               </gap>t in Guilt to that of <hi>Iudas!</hi> In all preceeding Ages, Parliaments have been the Pillars of our Liberty, the sure Defenders of the Oppressed: They, who formerly could bridle Kings, and keep the Ballance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual between them and the People, are now become the Instruments of all our Oppressions, and a Sword in his Hand to destroy us: They themselves, led by a few interested Persons, who are willing to buy Offices for themselves by the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the whole Nation, and the Blood of the most worthy and eminent Persons in it. Detestable Bribes, worse than the Oaths now in fashion in this Mercenary Court! I mean, to owe neither my Life nor Liberty to any such Means; when the Innocence of my Actions will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect me, I will stay away till the Storm be overpass'd. In short, where <hi>Vane, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Haslerigg</hi> cannot live in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I cannot live at all. If I had been in <hi>England,</hi> I should have expected a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them; or, tho' they may be the first, as being more eminent than I, I must expect to follow their Example, in Suffering, as I have been their Companion in Acting. I am most in Amaze at the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37805:40"/>
mistaken Informations that were sent to me by my Friends, full of Expectations, of Favours, and Employments. Who can think, that they, who imprison them, would employ me, or suffer me to live, when they are put to death? If I might live, and be employ'd, can it be expected that I should serve a Government that seeks such detestable Ways of establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itself? Ah! no; I have not learnt to make my own Peace, by persecuting and betraying my Brethren, more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and worthy than myself: I must live by just Means, and serve to just Ends, or not at all, after such a Manifestation of the Ways by which it is intended the King shall govern. I should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced any Place of Favour into which the Kindness and Industry of my Friends might have advanc'd me, when I found those that were better than I, were only fit to be destroy'd. I had formerly some Jealousies, the fraudulent Proclamation for Indemnity, encreas'd the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those three Men; and turning out of all the Officers of the Army, contrary to Promise, confirm'd me in my Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, not to return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:37805:41"/>To conclude, The Tide is not to be diverted, nor the Oppress'd deliver'd; but God, in his time, will have Mercy on his People; he will save and defend them, and avenge the Blood of those who shall now perish, upon the Heads of those, who, in their Pride, think nothing is able to oppose them. Happy are those whom God shall make Instruments of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in so blessed a Work.

It is impossible to see you, without surrendring one's Heart to you; and he that hears you talk, and can still preserve his Liberty, may (for ought I know) revive the Miracle of the <hi>three Children</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and call for a Chamlet Cloak to keep him warm in the midst of a Fiery Furnace. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (Madam) I am none of those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle-mongers; I am true Flesh and Blood, like the rest of my Sex; and, as I make no Scruple to own my Passion to you, so you (Madam) without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Danger of being question'd by the Parliament, may pretend to all the Rights and Priviledges of a Conqueror. My Comfort is, that all Mankind, soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

or later, must wear your Chainr; for you have Beauty enough to engage the nicest Heart, though you had no Wit to set it off: And you have so plentiful a share of the last, that were you wholly destitute of the former, as I have already found to my Cost, you have but too much, you could not fail of harming the most Insensible. For my own part, I confess myself an Admirer, or, if you please, an Adorer of your Beauty: But I am a Slave, a meer downright effectual Slave to your Wit.

But it is not without the least Astonishment, that I receiv'd the News of what befel you t'other Day; it still makes me tremble, and leaves a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Impression behind it, not easie to be imagin'd. For Heaven's sake, Madam, what could urge you to so cruel a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that might have prov'd irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fatal to yourself, and matter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Affliction to your Friends? What Harm have I, and a Thousand more of your Adorers done you, that you should so terribly revenge the supposed Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of another upon them? Or, Why should you, whom Beauty and Wit have put in a Capacity to subdue our whole Sex, lay to Heart the Unkindness of one Lover, who may proceed to a new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction when you please? If I had Vanity

enough to aspire to be your Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, I wou'd e'en advise you to bury the remembrance of what is past, and either to punish all Mankind, as you ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily may, though I need not instruct you how; or else to chuse some happy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite out of the Throng of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and showre your Favours upon him.

                  <p>I Endure too much Torment to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and have endur'd it too long not to make the severest Complaint. I love you, I dote on you; Desire makes me mad, when I am near you; and Despair, when I am from you. Sure, of all Miseries, Love is to me the most intolerable; it haunts me in my Sleep, perplexes me when waking; every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Thought makes my Fears more powerful; and every delightful one makes my Wishes more unruly. In all other Uneasie Chances of a Man's Life,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37805:45"/>
there is an immediate Recourse to some kind of Succour or another: in Wants, we apply ourselves to our Friends; in Sickness, to Physicians: but Love, the Sum, the Total of all Misfortunes, must be endur'd with Silence, no Friend so dear to trust with such a Secret, nor Remedy in Art so powerful, to remove its Anguish. Since the first Day I saw you, I have hardly enjoy'd one Hour of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Quiet: I lov'd you early; and no sooner had I beheld that soft bewitching Face of yours, but I felt in my Heart the very Foundation of all my Peace give way: But when you became ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I must confess, that I did then rebel, had foolish Pride enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise myself, I would in time recover my Liberty: In spight of my enslav'd Nature, I swore against myself, I would not love you: I affected a Resentment, stifled my Spirit, and would not let it bend, so much as once to upbraid you, each Day it was my chance to see or to be near you: With stubborn Sufferance I resolv'd to bear and brave your Power; nay, did it often too, successfully, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally with Wine or Conversation I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or appeas'd the <hi>Daemon</hi> that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37805:45"/>
me; but when at Night, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my unhappy self, to give my Heart an account why I had done it so unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural a Violence, it was then I always paid a treble Interest for the short Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ease which I had borrow'd; then every treacherous Thought rose up, and took your part, nor left me till they had thrown me on my Bed, and open'd those Sluces of Tears that were to run till Morning. This has been for some Years my best Condition: Nay, Time itself, that decays all things else, has but encreas'd and added to my Longings. I tell it you, and charge you to believe it as you are generous, (which sure you must be, for every thing except your Neglect of me, perswades me that you are so) even at this time, tho' other Arms have held you, and so long trespass'd on those dear Joys that only were my Due; I love you with that tenderness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that purity of Truth, and that since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart, that I could sacrifice the nearest Friends or Interests I have on Earth, barely but to please you: If I had all the World, it should be yours; for with it I could be but miserable, if you were not mine. I appeal to yourself for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37805:46"/>
Justice, if through the whole Actions of my Life I have done any one thing that might not let you see how absolute your Authority was over me. Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands have been always sacred to me; your Smiles have always transported me, and your Frowns aw'd me. In short, you will quickly become to me the greatest Blessing, or the greatest Curse, that ever Man was doom'd to. I cannot so much as look on you without Confusion; Wishes and Fears rise up in War within me, and work a curs'd Distraction through my Soul, that must, I am sure, in time have wretched Consequences: You only can, with that healing Cordial, Love, asswage and calm my Torments; pity the Man then that would be proud to die for you, and cannot live without you, and allow him thus far to boast too, that (take out Fortune from the Ballance) you never were belov'd or courted by a Creature that had a nobler or juster Pretence to your Heart, than the Unfortunate and (even at this time) Weeping</p>

                  <p>IN value of your Quiet, tho' it would be the utter ruine of my own, I have endeavoured this Day to perswade myself never more to trouble you with a Passion that has tormented me sufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and is so much the more a Torment to me, in that I perceive it is become one to you, who are much dearer to me than my self. I have laid all the Reasons my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Condition would let me have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to, before me: I have consulted my Pride, whether a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37805:47"/>
have consulted too my very self, and find how careless Nature was in framing me; seasoned me hastily with all the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inclinations and Desires, but omitted the Ornaments that should make those Qualities become me: I have consulted too my Lot of Fortune, and find how foolishly I wish possession of what is so precious, all the World's too cheap for it; yet still I Love, still I dote on, and cheat myself, very content because the Folly pleases me. It is Pleasure to think how Fair you are, tho' at the same time worse than Damnation, to think how Cruel: Why should you tell me you have shut your Heart up for ever? It is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unworthy of yourself, sounds like Reserve, and not so much Sincerity, as sure I may claim even from a little of your Friendship. Can your Age, your Face, your Eyes, and your Spirit bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to that sweet Power? No, you know better to what end Heaven made you, know better how to manage Youth and Pleasure, then to let them die and pall upon your Hands. 'Tis me, 'tis only me you have barr'd your Heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. My Sufferings, my Diligence, my Sighs, Complaints, and Tears are of no

power with your haughty Nature; yet sure you might at least vouchsafe to pity them, not shift me off with gross, thick, home-spun Friendship, the common Coin that passes betwixt Worldly Interests: must that be my Lot! Take it Ill-natur'd, take it; give it to him who would waste his Fortune for you; give it the Man would fill your Lap with Gold; court you with Offers of vast rich Possessions; give it the Fool that has nothing but his Mony to plead for him; Love will have a much nearer Relation, or none. I ask for glorious Happiness; you bid me Welcome to your Friendship, it is like seating me at your Side-table, when I have the best Pretence to your Right-hand at the Feast. I Love, I Doat, I am Mad, and know no measure; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Extreams can give me ease; the kindest Love, or most provoking Scorn: Yet even your Scorn would not perform the Cure, it might indeed take off the edge of Hope, but damn'd Despair will gnaw my Heart for ever.

               <p>AS I hope to be sav'd, and that's a bold word in a Morning, when our Consciences, like Children, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most uneasie; when the Light of Nature flashes upon us with the Light of the Day, and makes way for the calm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Thought, that Eternal Foe to Quiet; but, I thank my Stars, I have shook that Snake out of my Bosom, and made Peace with that Domestick Enemy <hi>Conscience,</hi> and so much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous by being so—</p>
               <p>—But, as I was going to say, your Letter has put new Life into me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd me from the Damp, that Solitude and bad Company has flung me into; 'tis as hard to find a Man of Sense here, as a handsom Woman: A Company of Country 'Squires round a Table, is like a Company of Waiters round a dead Corps,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37805:52"/>
they are always ridiculously Sober and Grave, or, which is worse, impertinently Loud: Wine, that makes the gay Man of the Town brisk and sprightly, only serves to pluck off their Vail of Bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a Mask that Fools ought always to wear; and which, once off, makes 'em as nauseous, as a bare-fac'd Lady of the Pit; they are as particular in their Stories, as a Lawyer in his Evidence, and husband their Tales, as well as they do their Moneys: In short, as Madam <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> says, They are my Aversion of all Aversions.</p>
               <p>You may easily imagine, I have too much of the Men, but on my word, I have too little of the Women: Full of Youth, Vigour and Health I lye fallow, and, like the Vestal Virgins, am damn'd to Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Chastity in the midst of Flames. God knows what hard shifts I use, my Right-hand often does, what (like Acts of Charity) I'm asham'd my Left-hand shou'd know. As much as I despise the Conversation of these Fops, I court it out of an apprehension of being alone, not daring to trust myself to so dangerous a Companion as myself. 'Tis in these cool
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37805:53"/>
Intervals of Solitude, that we conspire Cuckoldom against our Friend, Treason against the State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Devil of Lust and Ambition, like other Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, only appears to us when we are alone.</p>
               <p>The Talking of the Devil, puts me in mind of the Parsons: I had the Benefit of the Clergy this Week; I mean the Company of two honest unbigotted Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; I drank a Bowl to the <hi>Manes</hi> of our immortal Friend, one that was as witty as Necessity, and discover'd more Truths, than ever Time did: One that was born to Unchain the World, that struggl'd with Mysteries as <hi>Hercules</hi> did with Monsters, and, like him, too fell by a Distaff.</p>
               <p>After so mournful a Subject, I'gad I'll make you Laugh— The Duce take me, if I did not, last Week, assist at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of making a Christian; nay, more Sir, I was, <hi>Honos sit Auribus,</hi> a Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who am</p>

Seriously, your last Fight makes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all of a Noise here below; it has made itself heard in a place, where the very Thunder of Heav'n is not heard; and has made your Glory known in a Country where even the Sun is not known. There are a great many <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> come hither, who were in the Action, and have inform'd us of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. I see no reason why the People of that Nation shou'd pass for Bullies; for I can assure you they are very civil Persons, and the King sent 'em hither t'other Day very mild and quiet. To tell you the truth, my LORD, you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37805:57"/>
your Affairs very well of late. To see with what speed you fly o're the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea,</hi> wou'd make one think you absolutely Master of it: There is not at present, in all its extent, one single Privateer in safety, and, if you go on at this rate, I can't see how you'd have <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Algiers</hi> subsist. We have here the <hi>Caesars,</hi> the <hi>Pompeys,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi>; they all agree, That you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly follow their Conduct in your way of fighting: But <hi>Caesar</hi> believes you to be superlatively <hi>Caesar.</hi> There are none here, ev'n to the <hi>Alaricks,</hi> the <hi>Gense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,</hi> the <hi>Theodoricks,</hi> and all the other Conquerors in <hi>icks,</hi> who don't speak ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well of this Action; and in Hell it self (I know not whether you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that Place) there is no Devil, my LORD, who does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess ingenuously, That at the Head of an Army you are a greater Devil, than himself: This is a Truth that your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enemies agree in.

Hell is extreamly byass'd in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. There is but one thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to your Conduct, and that is the little care, that you sometimes take of your Life. You are so well belov'd in this Country, that they don't desire your Company. Believe me, my LORD, I have already said it in the other World, a Demi-God, is but a <hi>very little thing,</hi> when he is dead; he's nothing like what he was, when he was alive. And as for me, who know already, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience what it is <hi>to be no more,</hi> I set the best Face on the Matter I can; but to hide nothing from you, I die with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to return to the World; were it only to have the Pleasure to see you there; in pursuance of this intended Voyage, I have already sent several times to find out the scatter'd Parts of my Body to set 'em together, but I cou'd never recover my Heart, which I left at parting with those seven Mistresses, that I serv'd, as you know so faithfully, the whole seven at once.

            <head>A LETTER Writ by Mr. <hi>DENNIS,</hi> Sent with the following SPEECH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have here sent you inclos'd, what I promis'd you by the last Post, and I think myself oblig'd to give you some account of it. In the late Appendix to the new <hi>Observator,</hi> I find the Author reasonably complaining of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of History by the <hi>French,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37805:59"/>
a reasonable guess, how false the History of this Age (as far as it is writ by them) is like to come out in the next. And particularly what Monsieur <hi>Pelisson</hi>'s History of the present King of <hi>France</hi> is like to be, which is now wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by that King's own order. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Boileau,</hi> who writ the enclos'd, has at least as great a share in that History as Monsieur <hi>Pelisson:</hi> And therefore you have in the enclos'd, in the which he has very artfully inserted a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of his Prince, a Pattern of what his part of the History will be. For having flatter'd his Master in this small <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> we have all the reason in the World to believe, That he will flatter him too in his History. And that he has flatter'd him here, you will plainly find; not only by Exaggerations, which are in some measure to be allow'd to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but in affirming things which are directly contrary to the truth. Such are those two remarkable Passages of the <hi>French</hi> King's offering Peace to the late Confederacy, for the general good of <hi>Christendom,</hi> (which not so much as a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who has common Sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves) and of his Bombarding <hi>Genoa,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:37805:60"/>
only to be reveng'd of its Insolency and of its Perfidiousness, which every Man, who has heard the Story of Mr. <hi>Valdryon,</hi> must laugh at. Now since it is to be presum'd, that Monsieur <hi>Boileau</hi> will flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him in his History, because it is plain that he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>latter'd him in his <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>; What are we to expect from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Pelisson,</hi> whose sincerity is by no means so much talk'd of as the other's? I thought to have concluded here: But it comes into my mind to make two Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon the Panegyrical part of the enclos'd. The first is this, That since Monsieur <hi>Boileau,</hi> who is, in the main, a Man of Sincerity, and a lover of Truth, could not but flatter <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth</hi> when he commended him; we may conclude, that it is impossible to give him a general commendation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery. For, where a Satyrick Poet paints, what other Man must not daub? The second Reflection is this, That since this <hi>Panegyrick</hi> is scarce to be supported, notwithstanding the most admirable ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Author, which shines through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and an Art to which nothing can be added, (remember that I speak of the Original) and beyond which nothing can
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37805:60"/>
be desir'd; you may easily conclude how extreamly fulsom the rest of the <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi> upon <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth</hi> must needs be, whose Authors fall infinitely short of <hi>Boileau</hi>'s, either Genius, or Art, or Vertue.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>THe Honour this Day confer'd upon me, is something so great, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, so little expected; and so many several sorts of reasons ought to have for ever excluded me from it, that at this very Moment, in which I return my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37805:61"/>
Acknowledgments, I am doubtful if I ought to believe it. Is it then possible, can it be true, Gentlemen, that you have in effect judg'd me worthy to be admitted into this illustrious Society, whose famous Establishment does no less honour to the memory of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> than all the rest of the numerous Wonders of his matchless Ministry? And what must be the thoughts of that great Man? What must be the thoughts of that wise Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, who after him enjoy'd the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Protectorship; and after whom it was your Opinion, that none but your King had right to be your Protector? What must be their thoughts, Gentlemen, if they should behold me this day, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Part of this Glorious Body, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their eternal care and esteem; and into which by the Laws which they have establish'd, by the Maxims which they have maintain'd, no one ought to be receiv'd, who is not of a spotless Merit, an extraordinary Wit, and comparable even to you? But farther, whom do I succeed in the Place which you are pleas'd to afford me here? <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Monsieur de</hi> Besons.</note> Is it not a Man who is equally renown'd for his great Employments,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37805:62"/>
and his profound Capacity? Is it not a Magistrate who fill'd one of the formost Seats in the Council; and who, in so many important Occasions, has been Honoured by his Prince, with his strictest Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: A Magistrate, no less wise than Experienc'd, watchful, laborious; with whom the more I compare myself, the less Proportion I find.</p>
            <p>I know very well, Gentlemen, (and who can be ignorant of it,) that in the choice which you make of Men who are proper to supply the Vacancies of your learned Assembly, you have no regard either to Place or to Dignity: That Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness, Learning, and an Acquaintance with all the more gentle Arts, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways usher'd in naked Merit to you, and that you do not believe it to be unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you, to substitute in the room of the highest Magistrate, of the most exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten no other Dignity, than that which his Desert has given him upon <hi>Parnassus.</hi> But if you barely consider me as a Man of Learning, what can I offer you that may
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37805:62"/>
be worthy of the favour, with which you have been pleas'd to honour me? Is it a wretched Collection of Poetry, success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rather by a happy temerity and a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous imitation of the Ancients, than by the beauty of its thoughts, or the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its expressions? Is it a Translation that falls so far short of the great Master-pieces with which you every day supply us; and in the which you so gloriously revive <hi>Thucydides, Xenophon, Tacitus,</hi> and all the rest of the renown'd Heroes of the most learn'd Antiquity? No, Gentlemen, you are too well acquainted with the just value of things, to recompence at a rate so high, such low Productions as mine, and offer me voluntarily upon so slight a foundation, an Honour which the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my want of Merit, has discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd me still from demanding.</p>
            <p>What can be the reason then, which in my behalf has so happily influenc'd you upon this occasion? I begin to make some discovery of it, and I dare engage that I shall not make you blush in exposing it. The goodness which the greatest Prince in the World has shewn in employing me, together with one of the first of your
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37805:63"/>
illustrious Writers, to make one Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the infinite number of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Actions; the Permission which he has given me to do this, has supply'd all my Defects with you.</p>
            <p>Yes, Gentlemen, whatever just Reasons ought to have excluded me ever from your Academy, you believed that you could not with Justice suffer that a Man who is destin'd to speak of such Mighty Things, should be depriv'd of the Utility of your Lessons, or instructed in any other School than in yours. And, by this, you have clearly shewn, that when it is to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rve your August Protector, whatever Consideration might otherwise restrain you, your Zeal will not suffer you to cast your eyes upon an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thing but the Interest of your Master's Glory.</p>
            <p>Yet suffer me, Gentlemen, to undeceive you, if you believe that that great Prince, at the time when he granted that favour to me, believ'd that he should meet within me a Writer, who was able to sustain in the least, by the Beauty of Style, or by the magnificent Pomp of Expression, the Grandeur of his Exploits. No, Gentlemen,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37805:63"/>
it belongs to you, and to Pens like yours, to shew the World such Master-pieces; and he never conceiv'd so advantageous a thought of me. But as every thing that he has done in his Reign is Wonderful, is Prodigious, he did not think it would be amiss, that in the midst of so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd Writers, who with emulation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe his Actions in all their Splendour, and with all the Ornaments of the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest Eloquence, a Man without Artifice, and accus'd rather of too much Sincerity than of Flattery, should contribute by his Labour and by his Advice, to set to shew in a proper light, and in all the simplicity of the most natural Style, the Truth of those Actions, which being of themselves so little probable, have rather need to be faithfully related, than to be strongly exaggerated.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Gentlemen, when Poets and Orators, and Historians, who are sometimes as daring as Poets or Orators, shall come to display upon so happy a Subject, all the bold strokes of their Art, all their force of Expression; when they shall say of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, more justly than was said of a famous Captain of old,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37805:64"/>
that he alone has atchiev'd more Exploits than other Princes have read; that he alone has taken more Towns, than other Monarchs have wish'd to take: When they shall assure us, that there is no Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the face of the Earth, no not the most Ambitious, who in the secret Prayers that he puts up to Heaven, dares presume to Petition for so much Glory, for so much Prosperity as Heaven has freely granted this Prince: When they shall write, that his Condust is Mistress of Events; that Fortune dares not contradict his Designs: When they shall paint him at the Head of his Armies, marching with Gigantick Strides, over great Rivers and the highest Mountains; thundring down Ramparts, rending hard Rocks, and tearing into ten thousand pieces every thing that resists his impetuous Shock: These Expressions will doubtless appear great, rich, noble, adapted to the lofty Subject; but at the same time that the World shall wonder at them, it will not think itself oblig'd to believe them, and the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uth may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily disown'd or mistaken, under the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise of its pompous Ornaments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:37805:64"/>But, when Writers without artifice, and who are contented faithfully to relate things, and with all the simplicity of Witnesses who depose, rather than of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, who make a Narration, shall rightly set forth, all that has pass'd in <hi>France,</hi> ever since the famous Peace of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi>; all that the King has done in his Dominions, to re-establish Order, Discipline, Law: when they shall reckon up all the Provinces which he has added to his Kingdoms in succeeding Wars, all the Advantages, all the Victories which he has gain'd of his Enemies; <hi>Holland, Germany, Spain,</hi> all <hi>Europe</hi> too feeble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him alone, a War that has been always fruitful in prosperity, and a more glorious Peace: When Pens that are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, I say, and a great deal more careful to write the Truth, than to make others admire them, shall rightly articulate all these Actions, disposed in their order of time, and attended with their real circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; who is it that can then dissent from them, I do not say of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I do not say of Allies; I say of our mortal Enemies? And tho' they shou'd be unwilling to acknowledge the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37805:65"/>

            <p>I Am sorry I must change my Style, and tell you I am now fully satisfied that your Ladiship never will be so; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fear'd your Desires wou'd exceed your Returns: But when I heard you were supply'd by three Nations, I thought you might have been modestly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And I have even yet good nature enough to pity your unfortunate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather Constitution, that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges half the Town of necessity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline all sorts of Commerce with you; I cou'd have wish'd you had had Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation enough left for me to have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, tho' you have cruelly robb'd me of the Joy of Loving, without making yourself any reasonable Advantage of it; had your Soul consulted my Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I should have had fairer play for my Passion, and not have been thus sacrifi'd to your most Egregious Follies; yet,

thinking me worthy of your Concern, tho' I visibly perceive most of my Letters have lost their way to your Ladiship. I beseech you be pleased, first, to believe I have written every Post; but, secondly, since I came, and then to enquire for them, that they may be commended into your hands, where alone they can hope for a favourable residence; I am very much a Sharer by Sympathy, in your Ladiship's satisfaction in the Converse you had in the Country, and find that to that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Company Fortune had been just, there being no Person fitter to receive all the Admiration of Persons best capable to pay them, than the great <hi>Berenice:</hi> I hope your Ladiship will speak me a real Servant of Dr. <hi>Wilkins</hi>; and all that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with you, have enrich'd all this Summer with yours. I humbly thank your Ladiship for your Promise of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, which indeed merits a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, not View only, but Universal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, if my Vote be considerable in things so much above me. If it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, oblige me with the sight of one of them, which (if your Ladiship com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it) shall be very faithfully return'd you. And now (Madam) why was

that a cruel Question, When will you come to <hi>Wales?</hi> 'Tis cruel to me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that it is yet in question; but I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg your Ladiship to unriddle that part of your Letter, for I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand why you, Madam, who have no Persons alive to whom your Birth hath submitted you, and have already by your Life secur'd to yourself the best Opinion the World can give you, should create an Awe upon your own Actions, from imaginary Inconveniencies: Happiness, I confess, is twofac'd, and one is Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that Opinion is certainly <hi>our own</hi>; for it were equally ridiculous and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to shape our <hi>Actions</hi> by others <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> I have had so much (and some sad) Reason to discuss this Principle, that I can speak with some Confidence, That <hi>none will ever be happy, who make their Happiness to consi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37805:78"/>
because there are some so supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the World, that will abstain from Meat, upon some Score or other, upon every day in the Year, that is, some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some days, and others upon others, and some upon all. You know, Madam, there is nothing so various as <hi>Vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> nothing so untrue to itself: Who shall then please, since none can fix it? 'Tis a Heresie (this of submitting to every blast of popular extravagancy) which I have combated in Persons very dear to me: <hi>Dear Madam,</hi> let them not have your Authority for a relapse, when I had almost committed them; but consider it without a Byass, and give Sentence as you see cause; and in that interim put me not off (<hi>Dear Madam</hi>) with those Chymera's, but tell me plainly what inconvenience is it to come? If it be one in earnest, I will submit, but otherwise I am so much my own Friend, and my Friend's Friend, as not to be satisfied with your Ladiship's taking measure of your Actions by others Opinion, when I know too that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest could find nothing in this Journey that they could condemn, but your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Charity to me, and that Censure you have already supported with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

and (notwithstanding my own consciousness of no ways deserving your sufferance upon that score) I cannot beg you to recover the Reputation of your Judgment in that particular, since it must be my Ruine. I should now say very much for your most obliging Commands to me, to write, and should beg frequent Letters from your Ladiship with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible importunity, and should by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from my <hi>Lucasia</hi> excuse her last Rudeness (as she calls it) in giving you account of her Honour for you under her own Hand, but I must beg your pardon now, and out-believing all, I can say up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one of these accounts, for really, <hi>Madam,</hi> you cannot tell how to imagine any Person more to any one than I am,</p>

is not to be imagin'd by any Soul wound up to a less concern in Friendship than yours is, and therefore I cannot hope to make others sensible of my vast desires to enjoy you, but I can safely appeal to your own illustrious Heart, where I am sure of a Court of Equity to relieve me in all the Complaints and Supplications my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can put up: Madam, I am assured you love me, and that being once grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis out of dispute, that your Love must have nobler circumstances than mine, but because the greatness and reality of it must be always disputed with you, by me there must of necessity remain the obligingness of your Love to weigh down the Ballance, and give you that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over me in friendship, which you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably have in all things else, and if this reasoning be true, (as sure there are all Sciences in Friendship, and then Logick cannot be excluded) I have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued myself into handsom necessity of being eternally on the receiving hand, but let me qualifie that seeming mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by assuring you, that even that is the greatest testimony of my esteem for your Ladiship, that ever I can give; for I have a natural pride (that I cannot

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37805:82"/>
a disappointment to me is the greatest of Miseries; and then, Madam, I trust you will be convinc'd of this necessity there is of your Life and Health, since Heaven it self appears so much concern'd in it, as to restore it by a Miracle: And, truly, had you been still in danger, I should have look'd upon that as more ominous than the Blazing-star, so much discours'd of; but you are one of those extraordinary Blessings which are the Publick Concernments, and are, I trust, reserv'd to be yet many Years an Example of Honour and Ornament to Religion.</p>
               <p>Oh, Madam, I have abundance to tell you and ask you, and if you will not hasten to hear it, you will be almost as cruel as <hi>Arsaces</hi>; but you will come, and, if you find any thing in this Letter that seems to question it, impute it to the continual distrust of my own Merit, which will not permit me easily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my self favoured: Dear Madam, if you think me too timerous, confute me by the welcome Experiment of your Company, which, really, I perpetually long for, and again beg, as you love me, and claim as you would have me

not as utterly weary of hunting after you any longer, as ever Statesman was of serving the Publick, when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick forgot to bribe his private Interest. Shou'd I but set down how many tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Leagues I have travell'd, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten I have shot all the City-gates, cross'd <hi>Lincolns-inn Fields,</hi> pass'd the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Exchange,</hi> and doubled the Cape of <hi>Covent-garden</hi> Church to see you, I shou'd grow more voluminous than <hi>Coryat</hi>; and you'd fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy yourself, without doubt, engaged in <hi>Purchase</hi>'s or <hi>Hackluyt</hi>'s Itineraries. As you are a Person of half Business and half Pleasure, (which the Wise say, is the best Composition in the World) I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd you in your two Capacities, and order'd my Visits accordingly. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I call'd upon you betimes in a Morning, when nothing was to be met in the Streets, but grave Tradesmen, stalking in their Slippers to the next Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-house; Midnight-drunkards, reeling home from the <hi>Rose</hi>; industrious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, who had been earning a Penny over Night, tripping it on foot to their Lodgings; Ragmen, picking up Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for <hi>Grubstreet</hi>; in short, nothing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37805:87"/>
but Bailiffs, Chimney-sweepers, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwomen, and other People of the same early Occupations, and yet, as my ill Stars contriv'd it, you were still gone out before me. At other times I have call'd at Four in Afternoon, the Sober Hour, when other discreet Gentlemen were but newly up, and dressing to go to the Play; but to as little purpose as in the Morning. Then, towards the Evening, I have a hundred times examin'd the Pit and Boxes, the Chocolate-houses, the Taverns, and all places of publick resort, except a Church, (and there, I confess, I cou'd no more expect to meet you, than a right <hi>Beau</hi> of the last <hi>Paris</hi> Edition in the <hi>Bear-garden</hi>) but still I failed of you eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, tho' sometimes you 'scaped me as narrowly as a Quibble does some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Statesmen I cou'd name to you. Is it not strange, thought I to my self, that every paltry Astrologer about the Town, by the help of a foolish Telescope, shou'd be able to have the Seven Planets at a Minute's warning, nay, and their very Attendants, their <hi>Satellites</hi> too, tho' some of them are so many hundred thousand Miles distant from us, to know precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they go to Bed, and what Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

But, for my part, I believe a Man may sooner find out a true Key to the <hi>Revelations,</hi> than discover your By-haunts, and solve every Problem in <hi>Euclid</hi> much easier than yourself. With all Reverence be it said, Your Ways are as hard to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as those of Heaven; and the Dean of <hi>P</hi>—, who in his late History of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has explain'd all the several <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena's</hi> of it, but his own Conversions, is the fittest Person I know of in the World to account for your Eclipses. Some of your and my good Friends, (whom I need not mention to you) have cross'd the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, made the <hi>Tour</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> seen the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> and might, if they pleas'd, have got drunk with a dozen of <hi>German</hi> Princes, in half the time. I have been beating the Hoof up and down <hi>London,</hi> to find out you; — so that at last, after a World of mortifying Disappointments, taking a <hi>Martial</hi> in my hands, I happen'd to light upon an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram of his, address'd to <hi>Decianus,</hi> a very

At last, when Matters were ripe, I disclosed the unwelcome Secret to him —. He raved and wept, and, after some interval, wept and raved again; but, thanks to my pious Advice, and the kind Influence of t'other Bottle, it was not long before the Paroxysm was over. I cou'd almost wish you had been by, to see how heroically he threw off your Chains; with what Alacrity he tore you from his Bosom; and, in fine, with what a Christian Self-denial he renounc'd you; more heartily, I dare swear, than his Godfather abjur'd the Devil for him at his Baptism.</p>
               <p>And now, Madam, tho' I confess you have prevented my Curses, by your choice of such a Coxcomb, and 'tis not good Manners to solicite a Judgment from Heaven on every such Accident at this, (for Providence wou'd have a fine time on't, to be at the expence of a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, for every Woman that forswears

herself) yet so much do I resent the ill usage of my Friend, that I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give you this conviction, how earnestly I can pray, when I set my self to't. Therefore give me leave, Madam, to throw these hearty Ejaculations at your Head, now, since I shall not have the honour to throw a Stocking at you on the fatal Night of Consummation.</p>
               <p>May the Brute, your Husband, be as Jealous of you, as Usurpers are of their new Subjects, and, to shew his good opinion of your Judgment as well as your Virtue, may he suspect you of a Commerce with nothing of God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; nothing like a Gentleman that may serve to excuse the Sin, but lowsie Bush-begotten Vagabonds, and hideous Rogues in Rags and Tatters, or Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that stole into the World, when Nature was asl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him that way; under which preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may he never open his Mouth, but to Curse, nor lift up his Hands, but to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise you.

Thus may your Nights be spent in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Quarrels, and your Nuptial-sheets boast of no honourable Blood but what's owing to these Nocturnal Skirmishes. May he lock you up from the sight of all Mankind, and leave you nothing but your ill Conscience to keep you company, till at last, between his penurious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and the sense of your own guilt, you make so terrible a Figure, that the worst Witch in <hi>Mackbeth</hi> wou'd seem an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to you.

               <p>I Found a Letter of your Ladiship's own Hand left for me last Night at my Lodgings.

But, with submission, methinks the Language of all three was very sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing: You complain of my absence, and coldness, and the Lord knows what, tho' 'tis but four days ago since I gave you the best convictions of my Love I cou'd, and you flatter'd me strangely, if you were not satisfied with them: May I be as unacceptable to all Womankind as an old Eunuch with <hi>Io. Haynes</hi>'s Voice, if there's a Person in the Universe whom I adore above yourself; but the devoutest Lover upon Earth may sometimes be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37805:95"/>
without an Offering, and then certainly he's excused by all Love's Cannon-Law in the World, for not coming to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi> There are People I know that love to hear the rattling of the Boxes, and show themselves at the Groom-Porter's, when they have not a Farthing in their Pockets; but for my part, I cou'd never endure to be an idle Looker on. I have a thousand Obligations to your Ladiship, and till I am in a capacity to repay them, shou'd be as uneasy to see you, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creditor when I have no Money to send him going. I am so very honest in my own nature, that I wou'd not put you off with half Payments, and if I were not, your Ladiship is so discerning, that I might much easier palm clipt Mony upon a Jew, than succeed in such a trick with so nice a Judge. Perhaps, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you are scrupulous in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter even to a Fault. 'Tis not enough for you, that your Mony is Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and that other People wou'd be glad on't, for if it is not of the largest size, or wants one grain of its due weight, you reject it with indignation. But, what is the hardest case of all, (and you must pardon me, Madam, if I take this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37805:95"/>
occasion to reproach you with it) you are for engrossing a Man's whole Cash to your self, and, by your good will, wou'd not leave him one solitary Testar to distribute among the Needy else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, tho' you don't know what Objects of Charity he may meet abroad. This, in truth, is very severe usage: 'Tis the same as if the Government shou'd only take care to pay off the Soldiers in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and suffer the poor Seamen to starve. Even the Royal-Oak Lottery, who are fit to be imitated by you in this particular, never strip a Man intirely of all, but let him march off decently with a Crown or two to carry him home. If this Example won't work upon you, pray learn a piece of Tartarian-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, a Nonconformist Parson, who is a kind of a rambling Church Tartar, but of the worser sort, after he has grazed a beloved Text as bare as the back of one's Hand, is glad

for his own convenience, to remove to another. Both these Instances, you'll say, look as if I advised you to supply my defect in another place; I leave that to your own discretion, but really your humble Servant's present Exigences are such, that he must be forced to shut up his Exchequer for some time.</p>
               <p>I have a hundred times wished, That those unnatural Rogues, the Writers of Romances, had been all hanged, (<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> before me did the same for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries) for giving you, Ladies, such wrong Notions of things.

               <p>A Gentleman, that lives in your Neighbourhood, told me this Morning, after we had had some short Discourse about you, that you have buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Wife. You and I, Doctor, knew one another, I think, pretty well at the College; but being absolutely a stranger to your Wife's Person and Character, the Old Gentleman in Black take me, if I know how to behave my self upon this occasion; that is to say, whether to be Sad or Merry; whether to Condole, or Congratulate you. But, since I must do one or t'other, I think it best to go o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37805:98"/>
right. But if this won't suffice, I have Argument to make use of, that you can no more answer, than you can consute <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> I don't mean the Popish Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of that Name, (for, I believe, you have oftner laid him upon his Back, than Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> deceased) but an ungodly Vessel holding about six Gallons, which, in some Parts of <hi>England,</hi> goes by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name (the more's the pity 'tis suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd) and is call'd, a <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> — And thus I urge it. — Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, was either a very good, or a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad, or an indifferent, a between Hawk and Buzzard Wife; tho' you know the Primitive Christians, for the four first Ages of the Church, were all of Opinion, that there were no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Wives<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> however, <hi>disputandi gratia,</hi> I allow them here. Now, if she was a good Wife, she's certainly gone to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

If she was a bad one, your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will suggest the same to you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37805:98"/>
going to Councils and Schoolmen. So now it only remains upon my hands to prove, that you ought not to be concern'd for her Death, if she was an indifferent Wife; and Publick Authority having not thought fit as yet, to oblige us to mourn for Wives of that denomination, it follows, by the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> about things indifferent, that you had better let it alone, for fear of giving Scandal to weak Brethren.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Doctor, if you'll take my Advice, in the first place, Pluck up a good Heart; secondly, Smoak your Pipe, as you used to do; thirdly, Read mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; fourthly, Drink plentifully; fifthly and lastly, When you are distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Spoon-meat to the People next Sunday from your Pulpit, cast me a Hawk's Eye round your Congregation, and, if you can, spy out a Farmer's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plump and juicy, one that's likely to be a good Breeder, and whose Father is of some Authority in the Parish, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that may be necessary for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Holy Church) say no more, but pelt her with Letters, Hymns and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sonnets, till you have gain'd your

I told her, she was resolv'd to act <hi>Sampson's</hi> part, and Kill more People in the last Scene of her Life, than other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cou'd pretend to do in the whole five Acts of theirs. By a certain awkard Joy, that display'd itself all over her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and glowed even through her Cheeks of Buff, I cou'd perceive this nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous Incense was not unwelcome to her. 'Tis true, she had the Grace to deny all this; and told me, I rallied her, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd it so, as intriguing Sparks deny they have lain with fine Women, and some
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37805:103"/>
Wou'd-be Poets deny their writing of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless Lampoons, when they have a mind at the same time to be thought they did what they coldly disown. I cou'd not but observe upon this, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions, how merciful Heaven has been to us, in weaving Self-love so closely into our Natures, in order to make Life palatable. 'The Divines indeed arraign it as a Sin; that is, they wou'd make us more miserable than Providence ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd us, though were it not for this very Sin, not one of them in a hundred wou'd have Courage enough to talk in publick. For my part, I always consider'd it as the best Friend, and greatest blessing we have, without which, all those merry Farces that now serve to entertain us wou'd be lost, and the World itself be as silent and melancholy as a Spanish Court. 'Tis this blessed Vanity that makes all Mankind easie and chearful at home, (for no Body's a Fool, or a Rascal, or Ugly, or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in his own Eyes) that makes a Miser think himself Wise, an affected Coxcomb think himself a Wit, a thriving gay Villain think himself a Politician, and, in short, that makes my Lady <hi>Court-all</hi> believe herself agreeable. But to quit
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37805:104"/>
this Digression and pursue my Story.</p>
                     <p>On the Day abovemention'd, this dry Puss of Quality, that had such a furious longing to be Matrimonially larded, stole out of her House with two of her Grave Companions, and never did a Country Justice's Oatmeal-eating Daughter of Fifteen use more discretion to be undone with her Father's Clark, or Chaplain. <hi>Gray</hi>'s <hi>Inn</hi> Walks was the place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, where, after they had taken a few Turns, <hi>Lisanio</hi> and she walked sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to the Chappel, and the Holy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician Conjur'd them into the Circle. From thence they drove home in several Coaches, Din'd together, but not a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of the Wickedness they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, till towards Night, because then I suppose their Blushes were best conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they thought fit to own all. Upon this some few Friends were invited, and the Fiddles struck up, and my old Lady frisk'd about most notably, but was as much overtopp'd, and put out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by the Young Women, as <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-house</hi> with the New Buildings. Not to enter into a Detail of all that happen'd, this rusty Gammon of Bacon at last was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37805:104"/>
dished up between a pair of clean Sheets, soon after the Bridegroom follow'd, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act <hi>Curtius</hi>'s Story, and leap alive into a Gulf. Let others envy his fine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, and brace of Footmen, that think it worth the while; as for me, I shall always pity the Wretch, who, to fill his Guts at Noon, obliges himself to work in a Mine all Night. A poor Knight of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> that Dines upon good whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Air in the Temple-Walks, is a Prince to him.</p>
                     <p>I met <hi>Lisanio</hi> this Morning at the <hi>Rain-bow,</hi> and whether 'twas his Pride, or ill Humour, since Marriage, I can't tell; but he looked as grum as a Fanatick that fancies himself to be in the State of Grace. I have read somewhere, that the Great Mogul weighs himself once a Year, and that the Courtiers rejoyce or grieve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Royal Body increases or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishes. I wonder why some of our Nice Beaux that are Married, don't do the like, to know exactly what Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Spouse makes upon the Body Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. As for <hi>Lisanio,</hi> I wou'd advise him never to do it, because if he wastes proportionably to what he has done this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37805:105"/>
Week, a Skeleton will out-weigh him by the Year's End. But this is not half the Mortification that a Man must expect, who, to shew his Courage, ventures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Widow. Though he mounts the Guard every Night, and wears out his Carcase in her Service, till at last, like <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therington,</hi> in the Ballad, he fight's upon his Stumps, yet he's never thanked for his pains; But labours under the same ill Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances with a King that comes after one that is deposed, for he's sure to be told of his Predecessor upon all occasions. The second Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question, a Noble Structure, and yet we find the old Fellows wept, and shook their Heads at it: Every Widow is so far a Jew in her Heart, that as long as the World lasts, the second House will fall short of the Glory of the first. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am apt to imagine the Complaints is just, for a Maid and Widow are two different things; and how can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that a Man shou'd come with the same Appetite to a Second-hand Dish, as he brought with him when it was first serv'd upon the Table?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:37805:105"/>And now Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> I am upon the Chapter of Widows, give me leave to add a word or two more. A true Widow is as seldom unfurnish'd of an Excuse to Marry again, as a true Toper is without an Argument for Drinking. Let it rain or shine, be hot or cold, 'tis all one, a true Son of <hi>Bacchus</hi> never wants a good Reason to push about the Glass. And so a Widow, if she had a good Husband, thinks herself obliged, in meer Gratitude to Providence, to venture again; and if he was a bad one, she only tries to mend her hand in a second Choice. It was not so with the People of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> The former had a King that lost his Life in their Quarrel, and they wou'd have no more, because he was too good for them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one thing more to say before I have done, which though it looks like a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox at first sight, yet after you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd a while upon it, I fancy you'll grant to be true: 'Tis in short this, That a Man is the decay of his Vigour, when he begins to mistrust his Abilities, had

much better Marty a Widow than a Maid, For, as Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> has long ago observed, a Widow is a sort of Quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and you know the finest Racer may be as soon founder'd there, as the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Dray-horse. I am</p>

                     <hi>My Dear</hi> DOCTOR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have not writ to you these two Months, for which I expect to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reprimanded by you, when you come to Town. And yet why shou'd you wonder at such a poor Fellow as I am, for being backward in my Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if you consider 'tis the Case of <hi>Lombard-street,</hi> nay of the <hi>Bank,</hi> and the <hi>Exchequer</hi> it self (you see I support myself by very honourable Examples) at this present melancholy juncture, when, with a little alteration of Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Words, a Man may truly say,
<q>
                     <l>Nothing of <hi>Ready Cash</hi> is found,</l>
                     <l>But an Eternal <hi>Tick</hi> goes round.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>However, to make you some amends for so long a Delay, I come to visit you now, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, with an Olive-branch in my Mouth; that is, in plain
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:37805:109"/>
                  <hi>English,</hi> I bring you News of a Peace, of a firm, a lasting, and a general Peace, (for after this merry rate our Coffe-house <hi>Politicians</hi> talk) and pray do but consider, if 'twere only for the Pleasure of such an Amusement, what will be the happy Effects of it.</p>
               <p>In the first place, this Peace will soon beget good store of Money, (the want of which, though we are sinful enough in all Conscience, is yet the most Crying Sin of the Nation) and this Money will naturally end in a great deal of Riot and Intemperance; and Intemperance will beget a jolly Race of brave Diseases, with new Names and Titles; and then, <hi>My dear Doctor,</hi> you Physicians will have a Blessed Time on't.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who, were it not for two or three Noble Peers, some of their never-failing Clergy-Friends, a few well-disposed Widows, and stirring Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors, that keep up the Primitive Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly forget the Use of their Lungs, they too will see glorious Days again. I was told a melancholy Story t'other Day of two hopeful young Attorneys, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the general Decay of their Profession,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37805:110"/>
were glad to turn Presbyterian Divines; and that you'll say is a damn'd Time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when Lawyers are forced to turn Peace-makers. But as the World grows richer, People will recover by degrees out of this State of Laziness; Law Suits will multiply, and Discord make as splendid a Figure in the Hall as ever. Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong Squires will Rebel against their Lady Mothers, and the Church no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er connive at the abominable Sacrilege of Tythe-Pigs and Eggs converted to Lay Uses.</p>
               <p>And then, as for the honest Good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the Town, whose Souls have mourn'd in Secret, ever since the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Abdication of Claret; how will they rejoyce to see their old Friend sold at Twelve-pence a Quart again? What Matter of Joy will it be to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Liege-people, that they can get Drunk with half the Cost, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with half the Repentance next Morning? This will in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, revive the drooping Spirits of the City Sots; for nothing goes so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a true <hi>Cheapside</hi> Conscience, as an expensive Sin. As times go now, a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother can hardly peep into a Tavern
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37805:110"/>
without entailing a Week's Sobriety up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself; which, considering what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions there may be to drink away the Publick and Private Calamities, is a sad Mortification. Wine indeed is grown a sullen Mistress, that will only be enjoy'd by Men of some Fortune, and not by them neither, but upon solemn Days; so that if these wicked Taxes continue, <hi>Canary</hi> it self, tho' a Confederate of ours, is like to meet the Fate of condemn'd Criminals, to return to the dismal Place from whence it came, an Apothecary's Shop; and to be distributed about by discreet Nurses in the Primitive sneaking Gill. 'Tis true, the Parliament, as it became those to whom the People had delegated their Power, thought to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate these Grievances, by the Six-penny Act, and laying a Five hundred Pound Fine upon Cellar-Adultery; but the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, an impudent Generation, broke through these Laws as easily as if they had been Senators themselves; nay, had the Boldness to raise new Exactions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject: This obliged one half of the Town, at least, to come down a Story lower, and take up with dull <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Manufacture, so that half our Wit
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37805:111"/>
lies buried in execrable Flip, or fulsome <hi>Nottingham.</hi> To this may be ascribed all those phlegmatick, sickly Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have loaded of late both the Theatres, most of which puny Butter-prints, like Children begot by Pockey Parents, were scarce able to endure the Christening; and others, with mighty pains and difficulty, lived just long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (a <hi>Methuselah</hi>'s Age!) to be Crown'd with Damnation on the third Day. But when Money circulates mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and Claret is to be had at the old Price, a new Spirit will appear abroad, Wit and Mirth will shake off their Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and <hi>Parnassus,</hi> that has made such heavy returns of late Years, will trade considerably. It would be too tedious to reckon up all the other Advantages that the Kingdom will receive by this joyful turn of the Scene; but there are some behind, which I must not omit, because the Publick is so nearly concern'd in them. We have a World of Married Men now, that, to save Charges, take St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice in the Literal Sence, and, having Wives, live as if they had none at all, and so defraud both them and the Government; but upon the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37805:111"/>
Arrival of Peace, they'll vigorously set their Hands to the Plough again, and the Stale Batchelors too will find Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Marry, and leave behind them a pious Race of Fools, that, within these Twenty Years, will be ripe to be knock'd in the Head, in defence of the Liberty of the Subject, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion.</p>
               <p>We hear there's such a thing as New Money in the City, but it only visits the Elect, for the Generality of People are such Reprobates to the Government, that they may sooner get God's Grace, than a Mill'd Crown-piece. To inflame our Reckoning, tho' there's so little Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stirring in the Nation, that Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> is in greater hopes than ever of making his Paper-project take, yet the World was never so unseasonably scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous. What an Usurer wou'd have leap'd at in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Time, our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Porters now reject; which is full as ridiculous, as if in the present Difficulty of raising Recruits, a Captain shou'd resolve to take no Men but such as were eight Foot high, or a Gentleman in the last Ebb of his Fortune, when he can scarcely pay for Small-beer, shou'd then,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37805:112"/>
and never before, fall in Love with <hi>Champagen.</hi> The last Year we had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough, such as it was, merrily Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, the Lord knows, however it made a shift to find us Wine and Harlots: Now 'tis all silenc'd, and in the room of it, (but that too, will soon suffer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision) Faith passes for current, and never was there a Time of more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Chalk, since the Apostolical Ages. This, among other Evils, cannot but have an ill Effect, <hi>My dear Doctor,</hi> upon the Gentlemen of your Profession; for People at present, are so taken up with the Publick Transactions, or their own Losses, that they have no leisure, or are so poor, that they have no fancy to be Sick. The Generality of those that are, Christen a Distemper as they do Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> by the Name of God's Blessing, and tho' a Legion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases invest them, don't think it worth the while to send for a Physician to raise the Siege: If they do, 'tis for none of the College, 'tis for some Half-Crown Chirurgeon, who has cheated the World into an Opinion of his Skill, by putting Greek into his Sign, or for a Twelve-penny Seventh Son, that preaches on
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:37805:112"/>
Horseback in the Streets; but in the Case of Chronical Diseases, <hi>let the World rub,</hi> is the general Language. Men put off the mending of their Bodies, as they do of ill-tenanted Cottages, till they have Money to spare. There's a venerable Bawd in <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> that had her Windows demolished last <hi>Shrove-Tuesday,</hi> and she won't repair them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till there's a General Peace.</p>
               <p>I believe no Body in the Nation will be averse to it, but only our Friends in Red, and these find their Account so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in the continuance of the War, that if they ever pray, which, I believe, is but seldom, we must excuse 'em if 'tis against that Petition, <hi>Da pacem Domine in Diebus nostris.</hi> Some of 'em quitted <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> and some aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd other Stations to go into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and these upon a Change of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, must either turn Padders upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>'s, or the King's high Road, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn Authors, or <hi>Grands Voleurs,</hi> in their own defence. But <hi>Paul</hi>'s will be built in a short time, and then a <hi>Low-Country</hi> Captain will make as busie a Figure in the Middle Isle, as ever his Predecessors did in the Days of <hi>Ben.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:37805:113"/>
Iohnson.</hi> Some of them may fight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Battels of <hi>Steenkirk</hi> and <hi>Landen</hi> in Ordinaries, or demonstrate how <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> was taken, by scaling the Walls of a <hi>Christmas</hi> Pye; and others set up Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Schools, to instruct the City Youth. The latter, indeed, will act most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; for I observe, that when People are forc'd to change their Professions, they keep to 'em as nigh as they can, tho' they act in a lower Sphere: So for instance, a batter'd Harlot makes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Bawd, and a broken Cutler an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grinder of Knives. As for the Poets, I believe they are the most indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Men in the Kingdom as to what happens: They have lost nothing by the <hi>French</hi> Privateers since the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor are like to do, if the War lasts Seven Years longer, so it may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed they will not be angry to see the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calumny of their Profession, I mean their Poverty made universal; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if to pay People with fair Words, and no Performance, be Poetical, there's more Poetry in <hi>Grocers-hall,</hi> than in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>My dear Doctor,</hi> after all this mighty Discourse of a Peace, for my
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37805:113"/>
part, I shou'd believe as little of it, as I do of most of Mr. <hi>Aubrey</hi>'s Apparition Stories, but that we have not Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry on this great Law Suit, much longer, (for in effect, War is no other, only you must Fee more Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and give greater Bribes) and the Lord have Mercy, say I, on a Man that Sues, or a Prince that fights for his Right in <hi>Forma Pauperis.</hi> This, and nothing but this, makes me imagine we shall have a Peace, and not the Christian Piety of one or t'other side. And to say the truth, half the Vertue in the World, if traced to the Cradle, will be found to be the lawful Issue of meer Necessity. People lay aside their Vices, to which their Vertues succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOu seem to wonder, what should be the reason that Men, in Matters of <hi>Gallantry,</hi> generally have incurr'd the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Inconstancy, when Women prove faithful even to an Inconveniency. One reason I believe is, that we hate to be long confin'd, and their Conversation soon palls; tho' what may be assigned, with greater plausibleness, I think is, that those very Favours a Woman grants to her Lover, increase and continue her Affection, but withal lessen his. Mens
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37805:118"/>
Passion almost always extinguish with possession; and what is the Parent of a Woman's Tenderness is the Paricide of ours: We seldom adore longer than we desire, and what we aim at most can be conferr'd but once. In our Sex there is not that fatal distinction: but as a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, after yielding, has dispossess'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of that Jewel which every one was willing to have purchas'd, and only courted her for. I believe the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Love from Women, are more real than ours; there being too frequently more of Vanity than Verity, more of Study than Affection in our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: But it's no small Wound in a Woman's Heart, that constrains her to speak, and I really am of opinion, that she can hardly love more violently, who confesses she loves at all. A Word some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drops from their Mouths, which, as it was undesign'd, gives a clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a growing Inclination, than all the elaborate Actions and affected Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishings, the greatest part of Gallants put in practice. A lovely Face is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the most agreeable Object our Eyes can behold, and the very Sound of the Voice of one we dearly love, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37805:119"/>
the softest Harmony: Yet, by I know not what Fate, I have seen the Juncture when both were without any effect, and this more than once. The Latitude (I fancy) which we take in our Addresses, makes the Impression but feeble: Variety of Objects distracts the choice, and we conserve our Liberty while we are pitching upon a Tyrant. The indulgence of one Woman, who is not extreamly charming, makes some sort of reparation for the slighted Vows we vainly offer'd to a cruel Beauty. Few Men are so much in love, as to be Proof against the continued Scorn of the most agreeable <hi>Phillis:</hi> We ask to obtain, not to be deny'd; and he that can find the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOu have now, at length, left scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Watch, and teizing the Exchange-women, bid adieu to <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and taken up with Barrel-ale. You are all the Morning galloping after a Fox; all the Evening in a smoaky Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-corner, recounting whose Horse leap'd best, was oftenest in with the Dogs, and how readily Lightfoot hit the cooling Scent, and reviv'd your drooping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with a prospect of more diversion; which some Men, who think themselves as wise in the enjoyment of this World, as all the Men in <hi>Oxford-shire,</hi> are pleas'd to term meer fatigue. And I believe your own Footman would not ride so far and so hard to fetch a good Dinner, as both of you do to see the Death of a stinking Beast. Has not the <hi>Rose</hi> as good Accommodation as your <hi>Catherine-wheel</hi> Inn? And does not a Masque give a more Christian-like chase, and conclude in more satisfaction than the Animal you

wot of? I saw your Letters to some of our Club, and laugh'd not a little at the strangeness of your Style; it smelt of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Tobacco, and was stain'd with your dropping Tankard. You acquainted 'em at large with the Scituation of your Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-house; how a knot of branching Elms defended it from the North-wind; that the South-sun gave you good Grapes, and most sort of Wall-fruits; your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons came on apace, and you had hopes of much good Fruit this Summer.
