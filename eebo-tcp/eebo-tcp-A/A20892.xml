         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I muſt then, that I may beleeve

meaſure: and ought to
thinke that if indeed you have
any greife, tis becauſe I want
the bleſſing of your company

I ſhould declare no leſſe

where all familiarity is a

who are impertinent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune.
I have a double cauſe
of paine, the privation of a
great good, and the ſufferance
of a great ill. You cannot be ſo

to make you forget mine:

then, that when you thinke on

this cannot equall what I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for ſo many excellent

and all you but one alone. I
ought to reckon the cauſes of
my ſorrow ſo many as you are
moſt accompliſhed Ladies: or
rather ſo many as are the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualities which each of you
poſſeſſeth. Now if we meaſure
the greatneſſe of diſpleaſure
by that of the object, judge
how much I ſuffer, by what I

thinke that I can forget you.
Never imagine I meane to

my ſelfe but too much with

Letter bewraies it: well, think
what you pleaſe, I beleeve
there is no more danger to
borrow a good thing from a

fruite from a tree of our owne:
We do not reade them meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for pleaſure, but partly for

uſe. But to returne to our man;
I proteſt I deſire not ſuch a
good fortune; I love better the
reſtleſſeneſſe of your Spirit,
than the tranquillity of his, I
ſpeake of thoſe noble cares
which knowledge bringeth
forth; and of that moderate
feare which ſerves but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
the ſoule, and not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it. The happineſſe of theſe
people whereof you write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mee, is like to that of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe,
their ſpirit is quiet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.
I muſt make you
laugh as I conclude this Letter
at a compariſon, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you will judge a little too
high for mee. It ſeemes that
men may bee ſet ſafe from the
blowes of misfortune, as from
thoſe of thunder, by being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high, or very low; but in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10498:13"/>
both theſe, albeit, the ſafety
be equal, the glory is not. I had
rather ſcape a tempeſt being on
the mount Olympus, then in a
cave. And to talke like your
booke (the onely one that can
make mee guilty of theft.) I
would rather chooſe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
then below affliction, and
be thereof uncapeable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
rather then ſtupidity. I
conclude this then, beſeeching
you to ſpeake no more of that
matter, &amp; not to pleade againſt
your owne Intereſt, in quitting
that of great Spirits. You have
thereof too great a ſhare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.
And if I defend them,

            <p>MAdam, write what you
liſt for great ſpirits, it
ſeemes to mee they have more
glory, then happineſſe. And
that it is difficult to have great
ſplendor and little care. It is
true they are much eſteemed
which outſhine others: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
I thinke that with
all this advantage, they may
be compared to the buſh in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, which had much
brightneſſe, but yet was full of
thornes. There are indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſharpe points under theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10498:14"/>
glorious rayes: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cares which knowledge
encreaſes, rather then cures.
Let us ſpeake freely, and not
ſuffer our ſelves bee charmed
by this ſame faire appearance.
As thoſe that have a feaver
would willingly be leſſe ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they might bee leſſe
tormented, ſo I beleeve the
miſerable would wiſh their
knowledge diminiſhed, for to
diminiſh their affliction. In this
we may ſpeake of ſpirits, as of
the ſenſes, the moſt delicate do
ſooneſt feele. Phiſicke like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and Philoſophy doe in
the ſame manner heale the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
and the diſeaſed. The
one ſtupifies the ſenſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there is no ſorrow:
the other endeavours to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the attention, without
which there is no ſadneſſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10498:15"/>
whence you may learne that
the moſt ignorant are the leaſt
unfortunate. I deny not but
there are ſome which lift them
ſelves above miſery, and doe
ſurmount it; but I thinke theſe
are very rare: I ſee few that do
reſemble you. And to tell you
who they are, which put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to moſt paine, I beleeve
they are neither the great nor
the little, but onely the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
Mee thinkes diſquiet
formes it ſelfe in the ſoule, as
clouds doe in the Aire: The
Sunne ſometimes drawes up
vapours, which afterwards it
can hardly diſperſe; and theſe
middling Spirits precipitate
themſelves into thoſe cares,
from which they can never get
free, whiles great ſpirits over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
diſcontent, and the leſſer
know it not, the middle ſort are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10498:15"/>
intangled therein. So Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
reprobates the Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme,
from hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and morality rejects them
in point of civill felicity. Theſe
then are they which have cauſe
to complaine. And whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
ſeemes to mee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky,
ſince it onely ſerves to
leade them into many Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes,
but not to conduct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out. Have I not then reaſon to
thinke that thoſe which have
leſſe ſpirit, have leſſe paine? If
there bee ſo few which van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
affliction, is it not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that I follow the path moſt
beaten, and content my ſelfe
by ignorance to be below evil,
not being able by Iudgement
to lift my ſelfe above it. Since
the felicity of the loweſt wits
is true, I care not tho it be leſſe
glorious then that of great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

Tis a choyce worthy of
ſhame for himſelfe, of envy for
many, of admiration for all, we
are young, and it is to us a
ſtrange thing to ſee that in our
dayes, ſhe hath found a fortune
ſo prodigious, in the decline of
hers, And that any ſhould fall
in love with her, Albeit ſhee
wants the three goods, which
are thereof the ordinary cauſe,
for ſhe is neither faire, nor rich,
nor young. I do not doubt but
ſhe hath experience, ſure I am
ſhe hath age enough to get it:
but I cannot ceaſe to admire
that any man could fancy her
with all her knowledge. If ſhe
deſerved to be ſought unto, it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10498:17"/>
was like ſome <hi>Sibil,</hi> I meane to

of meere pitty to ſuccour old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
If ſtrangers finde them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they will take her for

could take from her. Time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
raviſh away thoſe goods
ſhee never poſſeſt. All it could
doe, is onely to make her more
aged, not more ill favoured.
She is rather an old deformity
then, woman. It might well
deprive her of ſtrength, but not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10498:17"/>
of beauty. It hath toucht no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but her haire, and by this

By your diſcourſe it ſhould

happens that time effacing the

Tis there that he is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Hath ſhee not Prudence, and
Vertue? And without theſe

ſomething deformed, then a

will become an honeſt man in

ceaſe to be Miſtreſſes after

that I love you; and thoſe that
accuſe me of ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I uſe this word, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cleere themſelves, they
know no more the lawes of

the word Love expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
reſpect, better than that of
feare. And I know not why
men take it ill, ſince God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is contented with it, when
he ſayes that we ſhould adore
him, he ſayes alſo that wee
ſhould Love him. I ſay more
he contents not himſelfe to
permit, but he commands it.
Tis ſtrange to ſee how farre
the vanity of man extends:
which is not ſatisfied with the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10498:21"/>
ſame termes that God would
have us employ, to expreſſe
the reſpect we owe him. Are
we equall unto him, if wee ſay
wee Love him? or have men
reaſon to demand more of one
another than God himſelfe
demands of them? but leave
wee theſe divine arguments,
there are enough humane,
feare may well be without
Love, but Love never without
feare; ſlaves may feare and yet
not Love, but children cannot
Love, and not feare: Tis ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

them with diſpute. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
them freely to every

If I thought to diſpleaſe

and ſhould aſſuredly beleeve
my obedience blameable. I
would not endanger the loſſe
of your friendſhip to defend a
word or a ſillable. I am not ſo
blinde to violate the lawes of
civility to maintaine thoſe of
Grammar. I could likewiſe
tell you that you ſhould not
put your ſelfe in choler againſt

you have toucht ſo neere the

a few words to make it appeare
reaſonable. It ſeemes to me
then that ſpeaking to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
us; its better to ſay wee
honour them, than to ſay one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we love them. I thinke it
would make the Court laugh
heartily, if one ſhould ſay to
the Queene in a Complement,
Madam I love you. It may be
this would paſſe in another
Country, or in another age:
but ſeeing we ought to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
our language to thoſe
that live with us, there is no
reaſon to reigle our civility by
that of <hi>Pharamond</hi> or of <hi>China.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:10498:23"/>
I am not much taken with
Proverbes, excepting thoſe of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> but yet I muſt tell you
I like that which counſels to
live, as few doe, but to ſpeake
with the moſt, wee ought not
to doe as others, but to ſpeake
like them: our actions we muſt
conforme to reaſon, but our
words to cuſtome. Tis a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to play the Philoſopher up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every name, to ſee if it doe
well expreſſe the nature of the
thing, we ought in this rather
to follow uſe than argument,
but I am content to employ
both the one and the other to
cleere our difficulty; as for uſe
tis plaine enough on my ſide,
and now let us ſee if reaſon be
contrary. Is it not true that
wee ought to entertaine great
perſons with diſcourſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
our ſubmiſſion. And I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10498:23"/>
leave you to thinke if this
word imploying reverence, be
not fitter for this than that of
love, or friendſhip, ſince when
a Nobleman ſayes I love you:
A vaſſall cannot reply as much
without treating him like an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
what difference ſhould
there then be betweene the
Complements of the high and
the low, and wherein ſhould
the Language of Authority be
diſtinguiſhed from that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?
that which they
ſay for fathers, may be ſaid
for all others on whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
Love doth never aſcend
which ſhewes not onely that
Children doe not returne as
much love as they receive
from their Parents; but alſo
that they ought not to ſay they
love them, but when Parents
promiſe affection, Children
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10498:24"/>
muſt offer obedience; this
Complement muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to the ſpring, not that
we are not obliged to love
them, but our love in this place
muſt expreſſe it ſelfe by the
mouth of feare. And whereas
you ſay that God commands
we love him, and a word
which pleaſes him ſhould not
diſpleaſe men: I will anſwere
onely, that in the ſame place
he commands alſo that wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
him, and that he requires
feare as well as love; or I may
cite one Law for another. If
God will that we love him,
he wils alſo that we honour
our Parents. It ſeemes to me
there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the honour we owe to
him, and that we render unto
men; he requires our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and demands rather the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10498:24"/>
motions of the heart, then the
words of the mouth: he hath
no neede of any man, but wee
have neede one of another, he
craves the ſervice of the heart,
and men want that of the hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he deſires not our actions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
becauſe they proceede
from love; and men oft times
ſeeke not affection, but onely
for the profitable effects which
it produceth, ſay what you liſt
wee draw more ſervice from
ſlaves, which feare without
love, then from thoſe which
love without feare Love doth
often aſpire to equality, but
feare doth alwayes containe
within reſpect. Men therefore
are to ſeeke that which is moſt
aſſured, whileſt God loves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us, but that which is
moſt noble. This is the reaſon
that ſpeaking to thoſe of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10498:25"/>
degree then our ſelves, tis
better to ſay we honour them,
then, we love them; this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
doth more pleaſe, and
the terme of reſpect doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expreſſe our dependance
than that of love or friendſhip.
I could purſue this matter, and
bring many other reaſons to
maintaine my cauſe, but it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
me to ſhew that it is not ſo
ridiculous as you deſcribe it.
I neede not ſo many proofes,
tis enough that I have cuſtome
on my ſide, ſince our language,
and civility, doe abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
thereupon, but to finiſh
this Letter, I muſt make you a

to thinke you have made

to your owne humour, as well

it ſtrange that you ſhould fall

you have thereof reſtified
ſo much horrour, you ſay that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10498:36"/>
the recreations there found are
more ſolid: I ſhould rather ſay
they are more dull. Your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

that there is not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy

goods which others provide

his affection which ought to

his crime; as if hee had

he of whom you complaine is

well enough how you are abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
you had ſome doubt of

otherwiſe I ſhould judge you
more worthy to be jeer'd then

have no other, but to write to
you ſome of the abſurdities
which they attribute to them,
and not to combat them by
reaſon. And I think to ſet them
downe, is enough to confute
them, and to ſhew their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy,
ſufficient to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in hatred. I will tell you then,
that one of their principall
maximes is to condemne all,
they cannot comprehend: as if
their opinion ought to be the
rule of our actions, and nothing
were reaſonable, but what is
thereto conformable: by their
ſayings, the vertue which wiſe
men follow, is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10498:41"/>
but a Chimera. Religion
overthrowes their ſenſe, and
with an ignorance and impiety
without paralell, they find not
onely what to reforme in the
providence of men, but alſo in
that of God himſelf; in ſo much
that there is nothing divine, nor
humane, wherein they find no
blemiſh. I leave you to judge,
if it be ſo, how much this ſect
ſhould be abhord by thoſe that
have ſoule or conſcience. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
tis a misfortune
that the novelty of this (with
ſome dexterity, they obſerve
to eſtabliſh it) gaines the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, who admire, if
they doe follow them. Theſe
brave ſpirits ſay, that they are
bent againſt none, but bad o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and that their chiefe
aime is to reſtore reaſon, and
vertue to their ancient force.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10498:42"/>
Howbeit, they are accuſed to
oppoſe both the one, and the
other, to the end they may the
better eſtabliſh licentiouſneſſe,
and vice. I could ſay more but
I would have my words as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
as my thoughts. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
I feare to deſcribe them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to the errour of
the world, then according to
the truth of their being. let us
leave then what they ſay of
their conſcience, to ſpeake of
that they ſee in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
let us quit their actions,
to entertaine our ſelves with
their lookes. If they have not
faults enough to condemne
them, at leaſt they have markes
viſible enough to make them
be knowne. They have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
deportments, whereby
when they would demonſtrate
the force, they ſhew but to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10498:42"/>
much the feebleneſſe of their
ſoules. If their life fright you,
their countenance makes you
laugh; and if they be Atheiſts
in heart, they are Buffons in
converſation. You ſhall ſee
ſome of theſe fellowes retire
from the company, the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
puld downe in their eyes, the
band out of order, and bigger
then ordinary, ſtriking with
their feete againſt the ground.
Inſtead of being aſhamed of
themſelves they perke up and
downe every where, and doe
not onely make private places
the witneſſes of their folly, but
alſo the publicke, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Exchange, the Walkes,
with all their ſtudyed poſtures
they would paſſe for great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
never thinking that their
apiſh trickes, doe better reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
madmen, then ſages. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10498:43"/>
they take them for
ſignes of a brave ſpirit, and
would have their ſtupidity,
paſſe for vigour, their coldneſſe
for prudence. They call their
ſilence an effect of that divine
raviſhment, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of beautious thoughts,
thus they name their defects,
and would have their ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
paſſe for ſageneſſe. This
dazzles but the vulgar, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thoſe onely which love
novelty better then reaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. But
let us paſſe on. They offend
not onely in the beleife they
hold of themſelves, but in that
they have of others, they
ſeeme diſpleaſed, and are diſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
even with the beſt things.
Although any ſpeak excellent
well in their company, they
give, or deny their approbation
by a nod, or a ſmile. Theſe are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10498:43"/>
the judges of our diſcourſe, and
our actions. Rarely doe they
give a perfect praiſe: they find
that ſolid ſpirits are groſſe, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
light, or ignorant. If any
good word eſcape them, as it
may happen ſometimes by
chance, tis ſtrange to heare
with what accent they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it. But we have ſpoken
enough of them; that which
they doe to acquire the eſteem
of the world loſes it, they
would paſſe for wiſe, and are
thought extravagant. Never
ſect was leſſe followed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

theirs: and I thinke they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in their opinion, when
they think well of themſelves.
This is what I have to write
touching the judgement many
make of brave ſpirits. I pray
you beleeve this Letter is none
of the leaſt witneſſes of my

            <p>MAdam, having well read
your Letter, I am much

in reputation for a noble ſpirit,
would blame thoſe that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſave that their opinions

we not to eſteeme their worth,

then wander with a multitude

that they are but Ieer'd: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
They doe no more in this

it ſelfe appeared ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10498:45"/>
to the eyes of many? and
have we not alwayes ſeen, that
people are no leſſe incenſed,
when you reverſe ſome ſottiſh
cuſtome, then if you had beate
downe all their Altars, and
rob'd them of their I dols! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the cauſe of this hate is
eaſie to be found: It is becauſe
the middle ſpirits cannot ſuffer
what is above them: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unable to raiſe themſelves,
they thinke it glory enough to
endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the downefall of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
We love reſemblance,
becauſe we love our ſelves. It
is not miſery alone, but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
alſo that ſeekes comfort
in company, and you know that
ſpirits, no more then the eyes,
can ſuffer brightneſſe, when
themſelves are feeble. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that if they be wicked, tis
reaſon they be hated: and if
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10498:45"/>
they be enemies to religion, I
proteſt, that I am not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
from their ſect, but alſo
afraid of it. If wee could love
ſpirit without goodneſſe, wee
muſt needes love the devils:
ſeeing they have much more of
it then all the Libertines of the
time, but if you except this, I
am not reſolv'd to hate them,
becauſe others doe not love
them. I muſt ſee whether they
be innocent or guilty, that I
may not abuſe my love nor
hate, whereof are they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
Tis ſaid they oppoſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and endeavour to baniſh
it from commerce. In this ſure
they are not much in the
wrong, ſince oftentimes tis but
a Mountebank that ſets a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
for a truth. If they have
nothing to doe, but with her, I
am of their ſide, what is there
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10498:46"/>
oft more troubleſome, then
that we call Complement?
To what end ſo many offers of
ſervice which we never meane
to performe. To what ſerve all
thoſe ſtudied phraſes, but enter
abuſe each other? and what
colour for it, to uſe the ſame
diſcourſe to every impertinent
fellow, &amp; to our honeſt friends
to ſpeake plainely, our civility
hath too much dawbing; and
is but a comaedian: ſhe ſpeakes
the language of the ſtage, and
plaies a fained part, and ſay
what they liſt, we are obliged
to thoſe which would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the plaiſter of diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and reſtore freedome to
ſociety, candor to commerce.
They will tell me, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the humor of great ſpirits,
we ſhould ſpeake with no leſſe
Sophiſtry, though fewer words:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10498:46"/>
I anſwer, that if there bee no
leſſe craft, there would be leſſe
diſprofit, and if there be no
more reality, at leaſt there
would be leſſe trouble, wee
ſhould be no more non pluſd
with theſe Complement. flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
converſation ſhould be
more free, leſſe importune. I
know tis oppoſite to the humor
of many, to ſpeake after any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moode: but what imports
the number of thoſe that are in
error? we muſt not give over
combatting this monſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it hath many heads. As
we may condemne ſuperſtition
without offence to piety: wee
may alſo oppoſe unreaſonable
ceremonie, without engaging
true civility; yon will ſay to
me, perhaps, that if the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of theſe faſhions of ſpeech,
and living, were in the wrong;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10498:47"/>
thoſe that follow them are in
the right; that it is dangerous
to reverſe an eſtabliſhed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome;
and that it is oft harder
to turne the courſe, then that
of a river. I confeſſe it difficult
but you ſhall grant me, that it is
more noble to undertake it,
and more glorious to goe
through with it. If none had
been ſo hardy to change unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
faſhions, wee ſhould yet
be appareld like thoſe Ladies,
painted in the Galleries at the
<hi>Louuer:</hi> we ſhould yet weare
great ſleeves, and fardingals,
Let us ſpeake of the cuſtomes
in carriage, and cloathing, as of
that of ſpeech: and let us ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
if we can, from converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a thouſand petty toyes, no
leſſe tedious, then ſuperfluous,
chiefly let us not take it ill, that
ſome endeavour it. Let us
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10498:47"/>
march cheerefully in the way
that others have plained for us.
If we have not courage enough
to doe this, let us leave the war
to others, and be content our
ſelves to enjoy the frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of
victory. Although I would not
enterpriſe to force this enemy
out of the world, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I wiſh him expeld. I know
we have neede of civility; but
ſince it depends on our owne
judgement, we erre if we make
it not leſſe irke ſome. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we toucht matter of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
which theſe great Spirits
deſire not ſo over orderly, doe
not you finde it ſtrange, to ſee
many like puppets, habiliate
themſelves, as if they went to
make a ſhew upon the Theatre:
This is enough to put Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
in choller, and Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
into a laughter. But let us
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10498:48"/>
not forget that which makes
brave ſpirits moſt odious: they
ſay they do ſometimes dream,
inſtead of diſcourſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
&amp; that this is aneffect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or ignorance: that in
this they cannot be defended,
ſeeing they are either unable
to talke as they ſhould, or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
not to be underſtood. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
tis for theſe two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that I would commend
them: for if they cannot ſpeake
have they not reaſon to hold
their peace? If they can, but
cannot bee underſtood, why
ſhould they diſplay their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
conceptions before ſots
that know not the price, take
their ſilence how you will, it is
very reaſonable, ſince holding
their peace, they ſhew at leaſt,
that if they have ſome defect,
they have not that to ſhew it,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10498:48"/>
and if they have ſome good
qualities, they looke for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Iudges, whoſe eſteeme
is worth meriting, ſay what
they will, when our company
is neither fit to diſcourſe, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to apprehend, wee muſt
have recourſe to fancy, ſeeing
there is no ſatisfaction to be
expected in ſpeech, or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All that remaines to ſpeak
of, is their apiſh lookes, which
I will not defend, if they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant:
I will onely ſay that
if this be bad in them, we muſt
not therefore ceaſe to praiſe
that which is good, we doe not
leave the uſe of Moone-light,
for any ſpots we find in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
nor doe we feare to gather
flowers, though they dwell in
the neighborhood of thornes.
Finally let them baw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I ſought to you alwayes with

nothing alterd in mee, but the
ordinary alacrity, which I
ſhewed, when we were better
agreed. Your countenance was
chang'd by miſpriſion, mine by
affliction. I complain'd of you,
inſtead of condemning you:
&amp; the extremity of my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
carryed me to the point, to
offer you the pardon you

carryed me; and put your ſelfe
no more in danger, to loſe a

I beſeech you eſteeme more
my affection, then your over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
and beleeve when you
ſhall be ſicke again of the ſame
diſeaſe, I have no more to doe,
but undeceive you to make
you whole. Its no great matter
I aske of you, if to inſtruct you,
be to ſatisfie. Remember that
you have never beene ſo cruel,
as when you have been ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
doe not imagine but
that there are ſlanderers: and
when you heare ill of me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of thinking my actions ſo,
can you not conſider they may
be falſe reports? Is there not
as much reaſon to beleeve mee
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10498:52"/>
innocent, as them true? And
what, muſt I to conſerve your
friendſhip, put all liers to death
and to eloigne you from error,
baniſh all ſeducers? If it were
ſo, your affection would not be
aſſured: it is better finde a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
more certaine for mee,
more glorious for you. Chaſe
away credulity, and Ile quit
my feare. your friendſhip will
be ſtable, provided your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
be not too light. We need
not diſarme thoſe that aſſaile
us, when we have bucklers to

If we cannot take malice from

ſo farre knowing, till ſhe come

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10498:55"/>
but when ſhe ſets upon this, ſhe
is in danger oft times, not to

that they might moderate the
deſire of knowledge, which
men ſtudy for neceſſity, women

if many Ladies of quality

cannot be affirmed, but of the
moſt ſtupid, &amp; the moſt groſſe,
how ignorant ſoever a woman

Never change it, what ever be

            <p>MAdam, there was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with us, when we
received the curious book you
ſent. I wiſh you had been here,
to obſerve the opinions of the
Countrey, they are either
groſſe, or falſe. To praiſe an
excellent peece, they content

trimme. There was a dame you

ſaw her; And judge what wee

ought to feare, or hope from

Thinke into what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
you have ſent honeſt <hi>F.</hi> to
make leſſons of morality.
Count it not ſtrange if they
give him not the approbation
hee deſerves, and if hee be no
better received in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
then thoſe that preach the
Goſpell among Turkes. At

ſo full of choyſe things, that
not to know all, were to injure
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10498:66"/>
the author. That which I find
there extraordinary, is that in
reading, we meet alacrity with
inſtruction, whereas others do

this advantage is gotten, not

And we have either of us given

There is but one misfortune,
which is that we cannot agree,
to reade it one after the other,
we would have it without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,

The meaning is we beg

            <p>MAdam, tis nothing ſtrange
if in the Countrey they
doe not eſteeme good bookes
as they ſhould: wee have not
indeed many here which can
Iudge of them ſoundly. There
is no body that praiſes not that
you received; and I can aſſure
you, that never was approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo generall, as that is given
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10498:67"/>
it. I ſpeake of that of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort, which ſpeake without
paſſion, and without intereſt.
There are ſome people found,
which not being able to know
good things, or to ſuffer their
brightneſſe, ſtraine themſelves
to make them ill, but they
have gained nothing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to have their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

appeare, they have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to change their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
albeit, perhaps they
have not diminiſhed their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.
But whatever they utter of
it, or would perſwade indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
men, it is profitable to all
ſorts of humours, and perſons.
The learned doe there finde
content, and the ignorant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Nevertheleſſe I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
you of one thing, that
whatever eſteeme you make of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10498:67"/>
this booke, you ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a ſpeciall one for him that
made it, you deſire to ſee him,
and I aſſure my ſelfe, you will
be no leſſe ſatisfied with his
entertainement, then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his writings. You ſhall
obſerve nothing in his viſage,
nor his diſcourſe, which ſmels
of that, we call an Author. And
you ſhall not finde in him that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aturall or affected dulneſſe of
many, which dreame in the

reaſon of their ſilence, but
that they compoſe. Theſe are
fitter for a cloſet, then ſociety,
they cannot expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but by the pen. He, you
ſhall ſee, is not of this humour:
he ſpeakes yet better then hee
writes, and gives the lye to
thoſe, who maintaine that the
ſame temperament cannot be
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10498:68"/>
proper to both. There is no
leſſe force in his diſcourſe then
judgement in his writings. And
above all you may marke in
both an extraordinary facility.
I ſpeake not of that vitious ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineſſe
which proceedes from
lightnes orindiſcretion. I know
well that the earth doth eaſily
produce ſuperfluous things,
and that of her ſelfe ſhe beares
thornes, and thiſtles enough. I
praiſe that excellent facility
which comes from the ſtrength
of ſpirit, when a man is maſter
of the ſubject he handles, and
good words are joyned with
rich thoughts. I will uſe a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
example to explaine a
profane matter. If holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith of the covetous that
they are the men of riches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſaying that tis the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of men; wee may ſay of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10498:68"/>
certaine Brokers, that they are
the men of ſcience, not that
they have the ſcience of men,
the one, and the other be the
ſlaves of their wealth, &amp; know
not how to diſtribute it with
reaſon. The Authour you ſhall
ſee is in no wiſe of this number,
let him ſpeake or write, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
himſelfe with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
extraordinary, try him
and you will affirme without
doubt, aſwell as many others
that know him, that readineſſe,
and ſtrength of Spirit, are in
him both equall. He is prompt
without being light, ſolid, with
out being dull. I will ſay no
more of him, and indeede, it
would alwaies be leſſe then he
deſerves, and I beleeve, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more then hee deſires. In

to you the error I lived in,

thought the countrey would

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10498:70"/>
my heavineſſe; and that the
converſation of the Dames of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Forreſts would

I thought leſſe on you, I ſhould

of your entertainement
renders me that of others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant.
and I may ſay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

I am in a Countrey where

I have too good an opinion of

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10498:72"/>

you are not content to wiſh me

you take the paines to ſpeake

MIſtris, if you thinke I have
forgotten you, never was
faith ſo faulty as yours. It is an
injury to both, ſeeing you muſt
have a bad opinion of my
friendſhip, or I not that I ought
to have of your merit. Iudge
the conſequence, for to want
memory, I muſt want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
We cannot in this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ingratitude from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And to examine all
things well, I underſtand not
how I can wiſh you good,
without remembring to doe it.
this ſhould be rather a ſicke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
then mine; I have too
much affection, to remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooveable:
and I can aſſure
you that occaſions ſhall rather
be wanting to my wil, then my
will to occaſions. This would
be a thought very vnprofitable<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to our friends, if we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10498:86"/>
them alwayes, except
at thoſe times they have neede
of us. Be then leſſe fearefull,
and if you will that I aſſure my
ſelfe of your affection, doubt
not of mine. I thinke on you,
and you have no neede to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
my memory, more then
my affection, the firſt is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the laſt. True friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is alwayes attended with
remembrance, and thoſe which
can forget: were never truely
in love, when wee fixe upon a
worthy object, wee reſemble
the covetous, who have no leſſe
care to conſerve then heape up
treaſure. Inſomuch that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
I entertaine my ſelfe
with you, is to beleeve I love
and yet however you conſent
to the laſt, you tell mee you
doubt the firſt. In this I know
not how to make your faith,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10498:86"/>
and your feare friends. Be for
the future more bold to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
me, and think that if ever
I want memory, I muſt be very
ſicke, the alteration, ſhould be
in my temperament, not my
friendſhip. If any diſeaſe ſhould
take away this faculty of my
ſoule, which onely renders me
happy in your abſence; I aſſure
you, I would alwayes have
your picture before my eyes. I
would employ this remedy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
moment, and refreſh your
<hi>Idea</hi> at the table. But I hope I
ſhall have no neede of this, to
entertaine my ſelfe without
ceaſing, with a perſon that had
no defect; if ſhe had not this to
employ mee with ceremony.
Its enough to know that our
friends want us, to gaine our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
we muſt not be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
when tis ſufficient to be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10498:87"/>
advertiſed. I have then reaſon
to complaine of you; and it
ſeemes to me that you have an
opinion ſcarce good enough of
my friendſhip, ſince you begge
the effects with ſo little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
I am very unhappy not
yet to have given you cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to rely on me, and to uſe
me with more aſſurance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your ſelfe onely that
if I ſeek occaſions to ſerve you,
you ſhould not feare to give
them, my intereſts are tyed to
yours; and I ſhall be no leſſe
obliged when you preſent mee
the meanes to doe you a good
turne, then if I had received
one. All that troubles mee in
this, is that I cannot benefit
you, but by depriving my ſelfe

you deſire this holy ſolitude,
you ſhall no longer ſtay here,

ſome part of your time, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine

This is my faith, and my conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
I am none of thoſe who

you be, one
would thinke you no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
your life, then as a thing
in which you have no intereſt.
Since you lament thoſe have
loſt it, why doe you put your
owne in danger? how comes
it to paſſe, you have not as
much feare for your ſelfe, as
ſadneſſe for others? tell mee
not that there are accidents in
which teares, and griefe are a
juſt effect of duty. Surely there
is more of cuſtome, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and I cannot comprehend
why our friends ſhould take
pleaſure to ſee that we doe our
ſelves an evill, from whence
they can draw no advantage.
So I call that of our exceſſive
ſorrow, for ſince wee beleeve
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10498:95"/>
them content in the other
world, if wee weepe for them
in this, our teares are injurious:
if it be for our ſelves, they are
mercenary: and for what ever
it be, they are ſuperfluous, but
if a wiſe man ought not to have
unprofitable paſſions, how ſhall
hee have any ſo dangerous?
Pardon me, if I tell you freely,
that if you diminiſh not your
griefe, I ſhall the beleife I had
of your ſpirit, what difference
is there betweene you, and one
that wilfully precipitates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
onely you kill more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly,
then ever any did wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of their owne death, take
heede leaſt to ſhew too much
pitty to others, you ſhew too
little to your ſelfe. Remember
what you were wont to ſay
touching the death of <hi>Lucretia:</hi>
you thought men could not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10498:96"/>
her murther. And what
did ſhe to her body, you doe
not to your ſoule? doe you
thinke that one is leſſe homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
that kils himſelfe in five
dayes, then in an houre? doe
not that with voluntary griefe,
ſhee did with her owne hand.
And what is it to purpoſe, if the
weapons wee uſe to take away
life, be viſible or not? if the
ſhorteſt death bee ſweeteſt,
judge what is that, you cauſe
your ſelfe by a ſadneſſe too af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected?
I know well the loſſe
of our friends doth touch us, I
would not remove the ſenſe,
but the errour: and if we muſt
give any thing to nature, wee
muſt yet give more to reaſon,
but I correct my ſelfe, it is not
ſo much nature th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t makes us
to weepe exceſſiuely, as opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſince there is no time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10498:96"/>
noble ſpirits ſhold not aſpire
to felicity, what ſhew of reaſon
is there, that to gaine the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of loving well, a man ſhould
racke, and torment himſelfe.
True it is that paſſions there
are, whereof we forbid but the
exceſſe: but for ſorrow, wee
ſhould take away the very uſe
it ſelfe: and not ſerve our ſelves
of it, but for repentance. In all
things elſe, it is ſuperfluous, and
indeede perilous. I doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
much admire, if
ſhee bee often Miſtreſſe of our
ſoule, ſince no body doth reſiſt
her: I ſay more, ſince wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
her ſpight of thoſe, that
offer remedy. Call to minde
that ſhee is unprofitable to the
dead, dangerous to the living:
and may take life from thoſe
that have it, not reſtore it, to
thoſe have loſt it: ſhee puſhes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10498:97"/>
into the grave, but never draws
back any. And to behold theſe
lamentable effects, take onely
your glaſſe, you may gueſſe the
ill it does your ſoule, by that it
does your face. Never did ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
doe ſo much miſchiefe as
yours, ſeeing it ruines at once
two of the faireſt things in the
world, your diſpoſition, and
your beauty; judge now if we
have cauſe to complaine, and
if your melancholly ought not
to be a juſt cauſe of ours, think
on this, and conſider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
you make weepe, whileſt
you lament but one. You ſee
what I might write, and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
not my letter neceſſary.
I ſpeake rather to your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
then your judgement, and
this is not to inſtruct, but call to
mind thoſe leſſons you give to
others, and would be at preſent
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10498:97"/>
uſefull to your ſelfe. I muſt now
ſay to your ſoule, as to ſicke
Phiſitians, that ſhee heale her
ſelfe. But I feare leaſt it be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as unprofitably to you, as
them, for if the ſickneſſe of the
body takes away knowledge,
much more that of the ſoule.
Neve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rtheleſſe I will hope bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and beleeve you will not
alwayes take pleaſure to hug
an ill, whereof you may heale
your ſelfe. At leaſt I thinke you
will interrupt a little your
teares, if you open your eies to
conſider her that prayes you, it

            <p>MAdam, I am in deſpaire
that my opinion is not
conformable to yours: and
that the ſame thing is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of your pleaſure, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
I ſpeake of the courſe
which you cal the faireſt houre
of the day, and I the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.
This is my opinion
which yet I love not, becauſe
yours is contrary, give mee
reaſons to combat it; there is
nothing I deſire ſo much, as to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:10498:100"/>
learne thoſe which make you
love it, that I may renounce
thoſe which make mee hate it.
I much feare not to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and albeit your ſpirit be
very powerfull over others,
leaſt mine in this occaſion, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her averſion to your elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
I ſay an averſion, not
blinde, like that of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who content themſelves
to ſay, they are not enclined to
ſuch a thing, and will not open
their eyes to ſee the truth they
know not. I doe not ſhut mine,
rather I ſtraine my ſelfe
to finde ſome reaſons to make
it pleaſing. I pry into every
corner, without diſcovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing faire, or agreeable.
We goe there to ſee, or to be
ſeene: and for that matter, I
have neither vanity enough,
nor curioſity, we turne, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10498:101"/>
we ſalute three things in
my judgement unprofitable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
or enough trouble ſome
I will not ſay dangerous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſpeaking to a perſon that
knowes how to preſerve her
ſelfein a greater contagion, and
which runs no other perill in
this adventure then that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
importuned. Tis to you
then an innocent diverſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
it may be, it be not ſo to
many others, but ſuppoſe it be
to all: have we not many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherin there is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
leſſe trouble? is it not
better to ſpend that houre in
entertaining of our friends,
then to make ſo many turnes in
the midſt of noyſe, and duſt?
This is neither converſation,
nor walking, ſeeing there is too
little familiarity for the one,
too much confuſion for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10498:101"/>
This is my opinion, which
perhaps is not conformable to
that of many others: but it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not, I ceaſe not to beleeve
it reaſonable, although I have
not many of my ſide. I know
there are more bad, then good
how ever I think the beſt may
be of diverſe opinions in ſuch a
matter. Howbeit leaſt I make
me to many enemies, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay, I take no pleaſure
therein, then that there is none
at all. I would not have my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
ſerve as a rule for others.
I am not vaine enough to
claime conformity, nor eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to yeeld it. I am not
careful to frame my ſelfe a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
wiſedome. And I let
you thinke if I deſire my aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
overcome, ſince it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
me of publicke pleaſure,
and makes mee hate what you

love. I will therefore tell you
that I have found the meanes
to draw ſome profit from the

had rather make ſport with it,
then complaine, you ſee how
all my mirth conſiſts in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

You ought to contribute

Albeit ſhe had but this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

ſince there is too great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
I muſt make her the ſame
complement for you, and refer
you both to a more particular
acquaintance, which you ſhall
get in time. But you are in the
wrong, to ſay there is nothing
amiable in you, but ſimplicity,
if you are ſimple tis by reaſon,
rather then nature. And if you
be without fineneſſe, tis not by
ignorance, but contempt, yours
is a noble ſimplicity, which
comes not from want of ſpirit,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10498:111"/>
like that of many, but onely
from an averſion you have to
impoſtures. I hate them ſo
much, that it is impoſſible for
me to ſuffer them. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I deſire ſo much, in thoſe
I love as a ſolid honeſty, which
ſerves for foundation to al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
and without which there
ſhall never be aſſurance in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,

ſee thoſe that are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

leſſe affect the appearance.
There are which conceale

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10498:112"/>
which I eſteeme ſo much the
more reaſonable, as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to yours. Finally,

thinke that you are ſorry to

ſeeme that I have more reaſon
to feare thunder, then others
have to runne away from Rats,

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10498:117"/>
examples wee have of it, that
which is capable of feare,
ought to be poſſeſt with it, at
this moſt fearefull Meteor, but
that this feare may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it muſt make us diſcourſe
of our owne weakeneſſe, and
the greatneſſe of God, which

I wiſh you knew my thought,

thoſe that had vowed

quitted this error, by the laſt

which are by ſo much the

On the contrary, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

this which makes your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe

which ſhould carry mee more
juſtly to revenge, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

In this minde I would never

not for feare to paſſe for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

you advantage by my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

This is all that I can write unto

               <p>She prayſes her manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and blames that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            </argument>
            <p>MAdam, I cannot ſay
how much I eſteeme
your letters; I had need make
as good to expreſſe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.
In what ſtile ſoever
you write them, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
pleaſing, or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
If you treate on ſubjects
of importance, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo full of inſtruction, if
they bee written with more
freedome, there is nothing ſo
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10498:140"/>
full of recreation. Serious
they are without ſtrayning,
familiar without neglect.
Your ſtile is like thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which appeare in all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions,
and ſtill pleaſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they bee neately dreſt
or plaine, and to touch that
which doth wholly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ant
mee, it is the great equali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
obſerved as well in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and writing, as in
your manner of life, by which
equality I meane not that one
ſhould doe, or ſpeake alwaies
the ſame thing, but that the
one, and the other be alwaies
well. I praiſe a perfection in
you, which is much wanting
in many others. There are
many which learne ſome
ſhreads of certaine bookes,
and know them by heart to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10498:141"/>
vent them in company, or in
their Letters. Theſe take
ſometimes, but they muſt
not ſhew often, if they meane
to acquire equall glory, they
are like to thoſe which ſell all
their goods for a weekes bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Their diſcourſe is flat
on ſome ſubjects, ſwelling in
others. This is to put a peece
of Scarlet upon a tottered
garment: tis to ſhew at the
ſame time theft, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and that they are not
onely poore, but unable to
uſe the wealth of others. Tis
to make their fall ſo much
the more dangerous, as they
ſtrove to flye too high wee
may maintaine that truth
ſhewes ſomething of <hi>Icarus</hi>
in our ſexe, though the fable
attribute it onely to men: to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10498:141"/>
ſpeake properly, they are
dwarfes upon ſtilts. Tis ſeene
they are little, and would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
great, we know the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their deſigne, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

imperfection of their ſtature.
You know of whom I ſpeake,
and I would tell you more,
had I more time, but I have
no more, but to aſſure you
that I am,</p>

            </argument>
            <p>MAdam, you erre to ſay
I have need of patience
for your Letters, as well as
your entertainement. You
muſt have a bad opinion of
mee, if you thinke I have no
better of you. Albeit I have
not judgement enough to
comprehend the goodneſſe
of yours, I ceaſe not to taſte
the ſweeteneſſe, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
griefe, not to be more
knowing that I might bee
more happy. I am ſure I
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10498:142"/>
ſhould draw more advantage
from your knowledge, then
you from my approbation,
and that I ſhould gaine more
by your inſtructions, then you
by my prayſes. But it weighes
not, you neede not complaine
much; if I have not judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to admire the
ſharpeneſſe, and delicacy of
your Letters, at leaſt I ſhew
them to thoſe that can better
judge, and which give you
an approbation more glorious
then mine. I entreate you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
me, and forbeare not to
write, albeit there be no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
worthy of your Letters.
They ſhall ſerve mee for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
and at leaſt you ſhall
gaine this advantage, that if I
be happy in imitation, thoſe
you ſhall receive from mee
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10498:143"/>
ſhall bee more polite, and
pleaſing to you, ſo much as
they ſhall reſemble yours.
Perhaps by little and little, I
ſhall become a good ſcholler
in your ſchoole, and if I take
the cuſtome to call you my
Miſtreſſe, I ſhall have new
ground to aſcribe you this
quality, and not onely to ſtile
my ſelfe your ſcholler, but,</p>
