            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Perceive you take it for granted (without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enquiring from my ſelf about it) that I wrote thoſe <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>weighty exceptions,</hi> which were lately publiſhed againſt your (Pretended and Palliated) <hi>Cure of Church Diviſions</hi>; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any neceſſary <hi>Sharpneſs</hi> which I was forced to uſe in that ſeaſonable <hi>Antidote,</hi> yet I find you ſtill are pleaſed to call me <hi>Brother,</hi> which is a Civility I ſhould have thanked you for, had the reſt of your ſtile been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the mildneſs of that expreſſion; but ſince you take that Unbecoming liberty, as to <hi>revile</hi> when you ſhould <hi>repent,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Confeſſing</hi> and <hi>Forſaking</hi> your <hi>Errors,</hi> charge me with crimes, which I bleſs God I dare not allow in my <hi>Words,</hi> (much leſs in my <hi>Writings</hi> which are more deliberate.) This makes me ſuſpect that your Pretence of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and allowing me the title of <hi>Brother,</hi> was only done with the ſame deſign, that <hi>Joab</hi> had when he thus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>Amaza,</hi> to make the <hi>Sword in your right Hand</hi> to be the leſs obſerved, and my wound thereby the more deadly and unavoidable; ſo that till my <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> be cleared, and your Repentance (for wronging me in both) manifeſted, it will be a Favour if you look upon me as one, who neither deſires, nor (if you believe what your ſelf hath writ) <hi>Deſerves,</hi> any ſuch expreſſions of your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103249:3"/>To ſhew how much you are for the <hi>Middle-way</hi> (tha is in other words, neither to be <hi>Hot</hi> nor <hi>Cold,</hi> or neither to be altogether for <hi>Truth</hi> nor altogether for <hi>Error,</hi> but to hang <hi>Laodicea</hi> like, in a <hi>Lukewarm,</hi> and <hi>Neutral indifference</hi> between both) you have taken pains to find out a <hi>Middle name,</hi> between a <hi>Miſtake</hi> and a <hi>Lye,</hi> which you wittily call an <hi>untruth</hi>; and this you are pleaſed to charge upon me, as a very ſoft word, and one that I would not be offended with: But Sir, this frothy complement might have been ſpared, for I hope you are not to learn that <hi>every untruth is a lye (Iohn</hi> 1.62.2.2) and you needed not have been ſo ſcrupulous of ſpeaking your thoughts in Scripture language; but this I ought not to wonder at, ſince you are not afraid to dethrone the <hi>Scripture</hi> from being a <hi>Perfect Rule,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Part 1. p. 99, 100, 101.</note>and therefore would manifeſt by this Invention, that you thought it not ſufficient to teach us the right way of ſpeaking, and ſo was not a <hi>Perfect Rule</hi> of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>But leaving your <hi>Phraſe,</hi> I rather chuſe to ſpeak unto the <hi>Thing</hi> you mean by it, and whether I have been ſo guilty as to wrong you, either by a <hi>Miſtake,</hi> or a <hi>Lye,</hi> or an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,</hi> or whatſoever fine word elſe you pleaſe to uſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now to be examined, in this brief <hi>review and defence</hi> of ſome of the principal <hi>Exceptions,</hi> that I have already urged againſt you, upon the clearing of which, the whole cauſe, that is in controverſie between us, will depend.</p>
            <p>My <hi>firſt Exception</hi> was, That <hi>the whole deſign of your Book was to make your Brethren</hi> (that have not your latitude, and cannot reach the ſubtilty of your Diſtinctions) <hi>Odious.</hi> This you tell me, is a <hi>Fundamental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth, which animates all the reſt for it was not your Deſign at all</hi>: Truly Sir, I am ſo unwilling to charge either you, or any elſe, with more then. I have grounds to think is juſtly your due, that I would gladly take your word in this matter, and ſo paſs it over; but I hope you will pardomme if I cannot; becauſe, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Many hundreds of ſober, impartial, and unbiaſſed perſons, have carefully read your Book, as well as my ſelf, and they all make the ſame judgment of it; and <hi>I</hi> think in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is to be eſteemed <hi>the deſign of a Book,</hi> whatever was the ſecret and unknown intention of the <hi>Writer,</hi> which the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103249:3"/>
words themſelves, and the manner of writing (without any ſtreining) do offer unto every ſerious and inquiſitive Reader: <hi>Secondly,</hi> This uſe hath already been made of your Book, to render ſuch as cannot <hi>Conform</hi> much more <hi>criminal</hi> then before, in that your <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> is urged againſt them; and this not only in diſcourſe by many, but by a late Author in Print, who quotes your Book to juſtifie his Treatiſe againſt <hi>Toleration.</hi> Thirdly, in your very next Paragraph, (and likewiſe elſewhere in this laſt Book) <note n="(b)" place="margin">Pag. 2. p. 7. part 1. p. 60, 61.</note> You call <hi>Separation</hi> a <hi>crying Sin, nay the crying ſin</hi>; and you ſcruple not to inſinuate that all the iudgments, which in this Nation we do either feel or fear, <hi>were to be changed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeparation as the principal procuring cauſe.</hi> Pray Sir, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, and then tell me, what can make your <hi>Brethren</hi> more <hi>Odious,</hi> and more expoſe them to the peoples fury, and to the Rulers Revenge, then thus to make them the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of the <hi>Nations Calamity:</hi> If in <hi>ſeparating</hi> from the <hi>publick Forms</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> (which we therefore account <hi>falſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>God hath not commanded them</hi>) our ſin is ſo great, that the place where we live cannot be held <hi>Innocent,</hi> but muſt ſuffer from the Hand of God for our ſakes, we are certainly a people who deſerve to be hated of all, and the <hi>Confiſcations, Impriſonments</hi> and <hi>Deaths,</hi> which ſome of us have already felt (and poſſibly may yet remain in greater extremity to be our portion) are no longer to be bewailed and grieved for as <hi>Perſecutions of the Innocent,</hi> but rather to be rejoyced and gloried in, as <hi>due puniſhments of Noxious Offenders</hi>; ſo that either you muſt retract and blot ſuch paſſages out of your Book (and thereby teſtifie your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of them) or we are confident both God and the World will juſtifie us, if we ſtill retain our Opinion of the ill meant and unworthy deſign of your Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
            <p>Your next attempt is to free your ſelf from being looked upon as <hi>an Earneſt and Active Inſtrument in the late Warr</hi>; I mean (ſince you preſs me to ſpeak plainly) <hi>in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's War againſt the King</hi>: I ſaid, <hi>It became not you to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſo much Bitterneſs what was then done,</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Par. 2. p. 10, 11. p. 1. p. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe you were as guilty of ſtirring up and fomenting that warr, as any one whatſoever:</hi> This you abſolutely deny, and boaſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103249:4"/>
much of your <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and ſeem to be greatly offended that ſuch a thing ſhould be charged upon you, and I am again reproached wth <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth</hi> for it: Sir, I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take up former matters, nor do I at all delight to expoſe you union the ſcorn of your enemies, and to the pity of your friends, but I cannot help it; you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently made the challenge, and will not be beholding to <hi>an act of Indemnity,</hi> but ſtand upon your <hi>Innocence,</hi> and therefore you muſt endure what follows. I muſt confeſs your bold and reſolute diſclaiming any <hi>Activeneſs in that warr,</hi> did ſo much ſtagger me, that I began to queſtion the truth of all the Reports that I had heard; but your own books (which I have ſince read) do ſo fully prove my charge, that nothing but your hopes that all is <hi>forgotten</hi> as well as <hi>pardoned,</hi> which is paſt, could ever embolden you to ſo peremptory denyal? What Sir, were not you <hi>as Active in that War as any</hi>? whcn, in your <hi>Holy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">p. 486.</note> you tell us, That, when you engaged in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> war againſt the <hi>King, You thought it the greateſt outward ſervice that ever you performed to God</hi>; And, <hi>That you encouraged many thouſands to it.</hi> And, that, <hi>Though many things fell out otherwiſe then you expected, yet you were ſo far from repenting of what you had done, that did the ſame circumſtances occurre, you would do it again, or elſe you ſhould be guilty of</hi> Treaſon <hi>or</hi> Diſloyalty <hi>againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power of the Land, and of perſidiouſneſs to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can you read Sir theſe paſſages, and ſtill deny, that with your utmoſt induſtry you did promote the War? or can you think you dealt uprightly in blaming thoſe, who did much leſs then you, though they have ſince ſuffered more? and becauſe you declaim ſo much againſt the changes which followed upon the War, and ask me, (who had nothing at all to do with it) many <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>enſnaring queſtions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. This I muſt tell you doth as little become you as the other; for how can you, with any appearance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, reproach others for <hi>Changing the Government,</hi> when, (in your writings) you do highly approve of that, which was the worſt part of the <hi>Change,</hi> the ſetting up of <hi>Cromwell</hi> to be <hi>Protector</hi>? what is this elſe but to cry out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103249:4"/>
loudly againſt the <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and yet to hugg and to embrace the <hi>Traytour</hi>? For you greatly commend that abſurd tool, <hi>The Humble Petition and Advice,</hi> (which was <hi>Cromwells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Government</hi>) <hi>And you ſay of it</hi>

I come now to ſpeak ſomething, and that very briefly, to the <hi>Queſtion</hi> about <hi>Conformity,</hi> which hath occaſioned all this heat betwixt us: and in the handling of this, I think I may alſo ſay, as you ſometimes did <note n="[n]" place="margin">Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Saints reſt.</note> I <hi>approve not Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies, nor a tedious ſtile, nor the heaping up of uſeleſs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words</hi>; which Rule in writing, though you forget to obſerve, yet I ſhall keep cloſe to; for Truth needs not many words to defend it.</p>

own Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi>

               <hi>you reſolved, if you lived where was an intollerable Miniſter, you would not hear him, nor come near him, ſo as to encourage him in his undertaking of that Sacred Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, and more of this nature (which you aſſert) being granted, <hi>I</hi> ſcarce ſee what it is that you contend for, or ſo earneſtly declaim againſt; ſince from theſe Grounds <hi>Separation</hi> at this day may eaſily be juſtified: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, every <hi>Pariſh Church</hi> is a Part of the <hi>Dioceſan</hi>; and if a <hi>Dioceſan Church, as ſuch,</hi> is not to be communicated with, then a <hi>Pariſh Church, as ſuch,</hi> is to be ſeperated from; ſince there is the ſame Reaſon of the <hi>Parts</hi> as of the <hi>Whole:</hi> And you muſt find out a new Logick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can prove, that if the <hi>Whole</hi> be Corrupt, any of the <hi>Parts</hi> are clean and fit for our Communion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a <hi>Pariſh Miniſter</hi> is (in that ſtation and office) but a Servant of the <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> and therefore right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a <hi>Curate,</hi> and if we may not own, (as you grant) the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> I think it will neceſſarily follow that his <hi>Subſtitute</hi> and <hi>Curate</hi> hath no reaſon to expect any Reſpect from us. We doe not uſe, in other caſes, to Regard the <hi>Man,</hi> when we think it a duty to deſpiſe the <hi>Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Perſecutors</hi> are not to be communicated with, <hi>nor ſuch as have conſented to our Silencing,</hi> which you alſo allow, (though I could wiſh you had proved it better then by the obſcure and diſputable Example of <hi>Martin</hi>) <note n="[q]" place="margin">part 1. p. 76,</note> then I think very few, if any of the <hi>Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> but muſt even upon this account alſo be ſeparated from; ſince either by <hi>Open Conſent,</hi> or elſe by an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoing</hi> and <hi>Pernicious ſilence,</hi> they have all made themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that grievous ſin: There being but little difference

in the ſight of God, between the <hi>perſecuting of Brethren</hi> our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves; and (by not <hi>ſharply reproving it,</hi>) ſeeming to approve of it in others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, admitting there are ſome Worthy and able men among the <hi>Pariſh Ministers</hi> (which for my own part, I believe never a whit the more becauſe you affirm it,) yet this we muſt ſay, that their ſin is great in ſubmitting to ſo undue a way of entring into the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we both forbear our ſelves, and warn all others not to <hi>hear</hi> them, becauſe we cannot think our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever ſent ſuch to Preach in his Name, who directly and by a ſolemn Oath have Renounced their <hi>Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> under pretence of Preaching <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and are indeed nothing elſe (as to the whole diſcharge and exerciſe of their Office) but <hi>Servants of men,</hi> which we have already fully learned from the Apoſtles, is altogether inconſiſtent with being <hi>Servants of Chriſt, Galatians</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 7.23. and therefore as ſuch we cannot own them.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103249:8"/>
this is a point ſo neceſſary to be maintained, and ſo utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſing that any thing is to be <hi>Obtruded,</hi> which he hath not <hi>Commanded,</hi> that we dare not allow our ſelves in the practiſe of any thing, which may prejudice that <hi>Fundamental:</hi> And we judge we have ſufficient warrant from what the Apoſtles did in a like caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.24. For if they reproved ſuch as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>other Legall Ceremonies,</hi> at that day, when as the Apoſtles had <hi>given them no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi>; ſaying of them, that they <hi>ſubverted</hi> (or <hi>ſpoiled</hi>) <hi>the ſouls of the Diſciples</hi>; then may we affirm the like of thoſe now, who, in things equally indefenſible doe act with every whit as little authority, from whom upon that very account, we think it our duty to ſeparate.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that you (after many others, who have formerly much better pleaded this cauſe) do inſiſt upon two Arguments by which you labour to defend your irregular way of Communion.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that <hi>in the Primitive Churches there were many Corruptions, which the Apoſtle writes against, but doth not adviſe any, becauſe of them, to ſeparate:</hi> But <hi>I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that in this <hi>Inſtance<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> as well as in your <hi>State,</hi> you do wholly (I will not ſay ignorantly) miſtake the <hi>Queſtion:</hi> For it is not <hi>Corruption</hi> or <hi>Errour,</hi> barely conſidered as ſuch, that we account to be a ſufficient ground of <hi>Separation</hi>; but the impoſing of that error with an high hand, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſubmiſſion to it (at leaſt in our practice and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervance) the very condition of Communion, this, we ſay, is a thing which neceſſitates us to make a <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that for the Reaſons I have already urged; To which I will adde only this, that, however the preſenting our Bodies at a Worſhip which we doe not inwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, may render us excuſable and juſtifie us among men, yet we are ſure it will not in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> who hates <hi>hypocriſie</hi> in his <hi>ſervice,</hi> and values every offering by the heart of him that brings it.</p>
            <p>I might content my ſelf with urging thus much, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Corruptions that were in the firſt Churches,</hi> are often pleaded in this Caſe, I will therefore examine the argument drawn from them a little farther, and <hi>Firſt,</hi> this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103249:9"/>
is clear in Scripture, that our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Holy and ſeparated from ſinners</hi>) did never <hi>Call</hi> nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign his <hi>Church</hi> to be an impure mixt body of <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy,</hi> without any diſtinction blended and hudled up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but we have it frequently mentioned in Scripture, that he called his people out of the world, to be an <hi>Holy ſeperate people; an habitation, and houſe for himſelf by his ſpirit to dwell in</hi>; with many expreſſions to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whereupon every one <hi>who names the Name of Chriſt,</hi> is ſolemnly commanded <hi>to depart from all unrighteouſneſs. Secondly,</hi> though through the Corruption of men, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Church Officers (for which they are blamed <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14.20.) many Ungodly Prophane <hi>Formaliſts</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> did (and daily doe) creep in, yet there is a ſtrict command given to <hi>put ſuch out of the Church</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.

All which places ſhow, that a <hi>Church,</hi> which after admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and diſcovery of Offenders, will not uſe her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in caſting them out, doth <hi>partake of their ſins,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as guilty as they, and therein as unworthy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, Laſtly, which will fully anſwer the ſcruple, it is to be conſidered, that the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtles, and conſtituted according to the <hi>divine pattern,</hi> having all the <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> and true <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> rightly eſtabliſhed amongſt them; ſo that though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſins did break out, and were viſible among ſome of the Members, yet a power was ſtill retained in each Church for the keeping themſelves <hi>pure,</hi> by caſting out <hi>Offenders</hi>; whereby they were kept to the <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and Orders of Chriſt, without any univerſal Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or degenerating in thoſe <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> as well as <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which they fell into in the ages after; and when

               <hi>not one of many hundreds, who ſpeak againſt Communion with Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, do underſtand what Arminianiſme is</hi>; As if the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference were either ſo ſmall, that it was not worth the while to oppoſe it, or elſe ſo abſtruſe and difficult, that plain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians could not eaſily come to know it.

            <p>Laſtly, when truth is to be examined, and the Nature of a thing ſtrictly to be conſidered, doe not argue againſt it, becauſe of ſome <hi>ill conſequences,</hi> which you fancy will follow: This is a common practice of <hi>Papists, Socinians,</hi> and your beloved Friends the <hi>Arminians,</hi> whoſe ſteps you tread in, and therefore may juſtly be ſuſpected to own their doctrines, and this ill temper you have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as in other things, ſo in particular in what you deſperately urge againſt the Scriptures being <note n="[f]" place="margin">part 1. p. 99, 100.</note> a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule</hi>; which Foundation of Faith and Practice you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to overthrow, by Tragically inſiſting upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that will <hi>follow,</hi> which is juſt to as much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as if I ſhould deny the <hi>Revelation</hi> of God, concerning <hi>Himſelf,</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>Decrees, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe I underſtand them not, and cannot reconcile them to that which I call reaſon; Sir, This in the end will be found perfect <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madneſs,</hi> and therefore pray leave it in time, leaſt the <hi>Lord repove you, and you be found a Lyar.</hi>

            <p>SInce the finiſhing of my Letter to you, I received the two following Papers, the one written by Mrs.— of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the other from my Brother <hi>Brown,</hi> whom you unhandſomly and untruly reflect upon in your laſt Treatiſe; I intreat you to read what they ſay in defence of themſelves, which I have taken liberty without their knowledge to ſend to you, that whatever you doe to me, yet to them you might not deny this juſt ſatisfaction, of making a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation</hi> for the unſeemly abuſes you have put upon them — Your words are theſe,</p>
            <q>
               <note place="margin">Part 2d. p.</note>I intreat you and the Reader to get and read a book publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> (as is uncontrouledly affirmed, who lately wrote againſt Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> againſt the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Communion in Pariſh Churches) concerning the experiences and ſtrange work of God on a Gentlewoman in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whom I will not name, becauſe yet living, and God may recover her, but is there well known; This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman having been long vain, and a conſtant negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of publick worſhip, was ſuddenly moved to go into the Church while I was there Preaching on <hi>Rom,</hi> 6.21. The very Text ſtruck her to the heart; but before the Sermon was done ſhe could hardly forbear crying out in the Congregation: She went home a changed perſon, reſolved for a holy life. But her affection or Paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong, and her Nature <hi>Tender,</hi> and her knowledge <hi>Small,</hi> ſhe quickly thought that the Quakers lived ſtrictli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then we, and fell in among them. At laſt perceiving them vilifie the Miniſtry and the Scripture, her heart ſmote her, and ſhe forſook them, as ſpeaking againſt that which by experience ſhe had found to do her good; and deſiring to ſpeak with me, who lived afarr off, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus much to me. But all theſe deep workings and troubles <hi>between</hi> the ſeveral wayes, did ſo affect her, that ſhe fell into a very ſtrong melancholy; inſomuch that ſhe impoſed ſuch an abſtinence from meat upon her ſelf,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103249:14"/>
that ſhe was much conſumed, and ſo debilitated as to keep her bed, and almoſt famiſhed. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> and others were her inſtructers, who were very zealous for the way cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Fifth Monarchy,</hi> and having inſtructed her in thoſe opinions, publiſhed the whole ſtory in Print, (which elſe I would not have mentioned) I ſhall ſay nothing of any thing which is otherwiſe known, but deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that doth but underſtand what Melancholy is, better than the Writers did, to read that book, and obſerve with ſorrow and pity, what a number of plain effects of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, as to <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures</hi>; and <hi>Actions</hi>: are there aſcribed to <hi>meer Temptations</hi> on one ſide, and to <hi>Gods unuſual</hi> or <hi>notable operations</hi> on the other ſide!</q>

            <p>AS touching Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I refer you to my Brother <hi>Browns</hi> Letter unto Mr. <hi>Bagſhawe,</hi> with this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as it relates to my ſelf, I am perfectly unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; it is a ſmall matter for me to be <hi>judged of mans day</hi>; yet I cannot but wonder that one of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould dare to open his mouth againſt the operations of the Holy Spirit in the Soul, the remembrance of which is ſtill ſweet to me, and cauſeth me to cry out, Oh! how exceeding excellent is thy loving kindneſs, thou God of grace, what was I poor ſilly Nothing, polluted duſt, that thou ſhouldſt chuſe me, bring me to his Foot, give me to find ſhadow againſt the ſcorching beams under Chriſt, and fill me with joy and peace through believing. And if this be the effect of <hi>Melancholy</hi>; I would tell Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> it is ſuch an effect, as I muſt magnifie the Grace of the Lord for ever for. And this confirms me, that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and lifted up, my loſt, forlorn, caſtdown, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overwhelmed ſoul, in that uſual path, in which he walks, adminiſtring comfort to his poor benighted ones, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſealing his love by his ſpirit in a word of promiſe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103249:14"/>
which I am ſorry Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould be found deriding of. But God will vindicate the work he hath wrought, though men pour contempt upon it, unto whom I commit it: but that Brother <hi>Brown</hi> was the Author of that book, that I was ſuddenly moved to go to hear Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that ought of his Sermon had any impreſſion upon me (which I could not attend to, becauſe I was ſo terrified with the words of the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. that I went away reſolved upon a holy life (when indeed <hi>I</hi> came into company, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eaſe and deliver my ſelf from the trouble which had ſeized me, which I mention with ſelf abhorrence and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rich Grace of God) That Brother <hi>Browne</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me in the <hi>Fifth Monarchy Principle</hi> (whereas he then oppoſed it) That <hi>I</hi> impoſed abſtinence upon my ſelf as to meat (when I would gladly have eaten but durſt not, becauſe I apprehended I had no right to the Creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Chriſt) This is all Falſe and Untrue, and I am aſtoniſhed that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould with ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence affirm theſe things; The Lord Pardon and Humble him.</p>

               <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſome time ſince peruſed Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> two laſt Treatiſes, which (to ſpeak modeſtly) give great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the adverſaries of Truth and Purity, to reproach and blaſpheme God and his People, and have cauſed great grief of heart to many that truly fear him; and this is no more (for the ſubſtance of it) than ſome of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own Diſciples have ſuggeſted to me. In his laſt (Entituled, <hi>A defence of the Principles of Love</hi>) He ſeverely chargeth you, but you need not be over ſolicitous, for thoſe that know the complexion and temper of the man, who writes thus, will wait to ſee your defence, before they believe you guilty of ſo many groſs <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths</hi>; eſpecially ſince I can prove Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (even while he thus condemns you) to be guilty himſelf of uttering many <hi>Falſities</hi> both of my ſelf and of others.</p>
            <p>I will not conceive my ſelf concern'd with what he ſpeaks <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 31. touching his Diſpute with Mr. <hi>Brown, An Army Chaplain</hi> (which I never was) about the <hi>Godhead of Chriſt</hi> [which I ever owned.] That Perſon was another of the ſame name, whom I never knew, and his Principles, ſo far as I have underſtood them, oppoſing the Doctrine of the Goſpel, I utterly deteſt; ſo that all wherein I may by any be ſuppoſed to be concerned, is, what he mentions, <hi>pag.</hi> 58, 59. <hi>Part.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That I am the Author of that Treatiſe [mentioned by him, as written againſt Mr. <hi>Tombe</hi>] <hi>againſt the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Communion with Pariſh Churches</hi>: this is more than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or any of his Informers can prove: and were he able, yet I think his mentioning of it, when in that place, there is not the leaſt occa Wſion for it, is ſcarce becoming thoſe Principles of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> he is ſo great a pretender to. Whether I writ the Book or not, I conceive it not requiſite to give him an account; for I ſhould be unwilling to truſt one with a ſecret, who will, it ſeems, when the humor takes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103249:15"/>
him, publiſh to the World, what he cannot, dares not, ſwear is true, although occaſion be thereby given, to ſuch as are no backward to lay hold upon every ſuch opportunity, utterly to ruine the Perſon of whom he reports it. I ſhall only add, that, whoever the Author was, I ſee no cauſe to diſown any thing conſiderable in that Book: and when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhall undertake a through diſcuſſion of the Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, not like a <hi>Dictator,</hi> but as an humble modeſt Chriſtian, I will either publickly <hi>Recant</hi> what I have now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or in meekneſſe debate it with him, provided he doth more candidly repreſent Arguments, than he hath done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of yours, &amp; particularly, that about <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in which you give the general ſenſe of all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> almoſt, that have writ upon the <hi>ſecond Command,</hi> who do univerſally reduce to it, as <hi>Forbidden</hi> there, whatever is <hi>added,</hi> or <hi>deviſed</hi> by men in the worſhip of God. So that how the <hi>preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſes</hi> can be excuſed from ſome degree of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be better proved, than to call all thoſe, that fear this of them <hi>Ignorant, Raſh,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceited.</hi> This in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother would be <hi>Railing</hi>; perhaps Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks it <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick,</hi> Religion I am ſure it is not; nor will it be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo by thoſe that conceive of God, as <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Jealous,</hi> and therefore dare not join in any thing which he hath not <hi>commanded,</hi> leſt he ſhould charge <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> upon them for doing <hi>ignorantly they know not what.</hi> More may be ſaid, but in this Point, I ſhall leave Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to you, and if you do not take notice of his perverting his Adverſaries arguments, and impoſing upon them a ſtrange new ſenſe of his own, if you do not reprove him for his vanity, in making <hi>men of ſtraw,</hi> and then unmercifully fighting againſt them, as if he took a pleaſure in demoliſhing the work of his own hands; if you do not obſerve and call him to an account for this, you will much wrong your Cauſe, and deceive my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of you.</p>
            <p>To come more cloſely to my ſelf, He informs us, that I am the Author or Publiſher of a Book, concerning the Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtrange work of God, upon a Gentlewoman in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and that I am uncontrouledly affirmed ſo to be. Give me leave to tell you Sir, that I cannot but wonder at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd confidence of the man; ſhould he be any longer
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103249:16"/>
ſuffered to take this liberty without controul, I might be ſuppoſed, for ought I ſee, to cumber the World with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books, (&amp; perhaps to as little purpoſe) as ſome body elſe: For indeed Sir, in two lines, there are no leſſe than <hi>two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.</hi> (I may I hope uſe <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> word) publiſhed to the VVorld concerning me. The Firſt, That I am the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Publiſher of that Book,</hi> which is affirmed by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt notorious evidence in the VVorld to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Author Mr. <hi>Timothy Jordain,</hi> a precious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, and now at reſt with him, ſubſcribed his Name to the Book, and in the Epiſtle prefixed, owns, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows himſelf to be the <hi>Author and Publiſher of it</hi>; and all that I did, was (being deſired) to write an Epiſtle, wherein I acquaint the Reader that I am not the <hi>Author of it,</hi> but only did joyn in Teſtimony to ſignifie what was Recorded in the enſuing Treatiſe was true. The ſecond <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth</hi> is, That I am <hi>uncontrouledly affirmed ſo to be,</hi> when I believe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath never a <hi>ſecond</hi> in the VVorld, that either will or can affirm it.</p>
            <p>As for the Book it ſelf, and the matter of fact contained in it, I never yet met with any judicious, ſober Chriſtian, (that hath ſeriouſly peruſed it) who durſt adventure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce either of the whole, or any conſiderable part of it, that it was an <hi>effect of Melancholy.</hi> Sir, one of the great deſigns of the Devil at this day, ſeems to be to drive men into direct <hi>Atheiſm,</hi>; and there are many too juſt complaints of its prodigious encreaſe in the Nation. Whether this decrying of <hi>experiences,</hi> this ſlighting <hi>the work of Gods Spirit</hi> in the ſoul, the crying out that theſe things are but the <hi>effects of Melancholy,</hi> be not the ready way to make all <hi>ſupernatural converſion</hi> derided, and the whole <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs</hi> contemned, <hi>I</hi> leave it with you to conſider.</p>
            <p>That I was this Gentlewomans <hi>Inſtructer in the Fifth Monarchy Principle,</hi> and that <hi>I was very zealous for it,</hi> are <hi>two more untruths</hi>; For I was neither zealous for that <hi>Principle,</hi> nor her <hi>Inſtructer</hi>; but I did at that time (ignorantly) oppoſe her in it; though indeed now it is my opinion, that there is a <hi>Glorious State of the Church</hi> yet to come (before the laſt end of all things) when all <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſors</hi> ſhall ceaſe, and every thing of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103249:16"/>
man ſhall be laid down in a ſubſerviency io the intereſt of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdoms of the World ſhall become his</hi>; which point I am ready to diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> when ever he ſhall think fit to doe it.</p>
            <p>He is alſo lamentably miſtaken in the account he gives of the Lords dealing with the Gentlewoman, of which I ſhall give you a few remarks, He tells us — <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>ſhe was ſuddainly moved to come to hear him Preach,</hi> whereas ſhe went (having been long ſick after <hi>Child bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>) in the accuſtomed formall manner that others were wont to do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>ſhe had ſuch convictions from his Sermon</hi> (for ſo he ſeems to intimate) <hi>that ſhe went home reſolved for an holy Life</hi>; whereas ſhe heard little or nothing of his Sermon, it was the Reading of the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. that ſtruck her heart; yet ſhe wreſtled againſt her convictions, and would gladly have got from under them, and for that end went into the Company of ſome friends, thinking to forget them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that ſhe <hi>deſired to ſpeak with him</hi> is another <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth</hi> (a <hi>Miſtake</hi> is too ſoft a word) For ſhe was hardly prevailed with to go to a Neighbours houſe to diſcourſe with him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that ſhe did <hi>impoſe upon her ſelf an Abstinence from Meat</hi>; She would gladly have eaten, and attempted it ſeveral times, but being under the ſence of her own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unworthineſs, ſuppoſing ſhe had no intereſt in the Lord, and ſo no right to the Creature (through the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him that lyes in wait to deſtroy) ſhe durſt not eat.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſhe never fell in ſo among the <hi>Quakers</hi> as to be one of them; though it is true, through the Power of Temptation, ſhe was ſomewhat enclined to them. But from them was marvellouſly recovered, as is intimated in the fore-mentioned Treatiſe; and now ſhe remains at as great a diſtance from them and their principles, as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf; nay (if I underſtand his principles) at a far greater: being fixed in following after the Lord and his Teachings in and by the Scriptures: And I hope, and am
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103249:17"/>
perſwaded, that, after all her ſhakings, tryals and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, God will for ever eſtabliſh her here.</p>
            <p>Dear Brother, I am ſorry that I have given you this trouble, but Love to the Truth, to the intereſt of the Lord, and to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſoul (whom I pray the Lord to forgive and humble) hath compelled me; I leave it to your wiſdom to make uſe of it, as you judge may be moſt conducing to thoſe forementioned ends, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>IT will I believe eaſily paſs for a Commendation of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Wit (though but little of his Honesty) that after he hath writ ſo much againſt both the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> he hath yet ſuch eaſie acceſs now to the <hi>Licenſers</hi> and <hi>Preſs,</hi> that he can <hi>Print</hi> Two books, before another can <hi>Publiſh</hi> a few Sheets in anſwer to One; but his laſt book about the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> (beſides that it might have wholly been ſpared (Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> having judiciouſly, and accurately handled that Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him) doth make ſo full a diſcovery of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in pleading for <hi>Saints-days,</hi> (that is, for <hi>Will-worſhip</hi>) and in Atheiſtically arguing againſt the <hi>Divine and Self-evidencing Authority</hi> of the Holy Scripture, (which he doth for many Pages together <note n="a" place="margin">p. 60. to 69.</note>) that, henceforth I hope he will no longer be a <hi>Snare,</hi> but juſtly be <hi>Rejected</hi> of all, as one of the worſt ſort of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> ſince under the Notion of being a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> he doth with his utmoſt Induſtry and Cunning labour to overthrow our Foundation, in that he, puts the <hi>Credit</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> upon the <hi>Truth of Hiſtory,</hi> and denyes any Certainty, but what may be gathered from that; which dangerous Doctrine I could not but warn thee, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, as thou loveſt thy Peace and Comfort, as well as the Truth of Chriſt, that thou wilt diligently beware of; and I muſt leave it to thee to judge, whether that <hi>Conformity,</hi> which ſuch a Perſon pleads for, is not juſtly to be ſuſpected.</p>
