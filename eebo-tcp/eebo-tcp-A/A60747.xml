            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Solemn Mock-Proceſſion: Or,</hi> The Tryal and Execution of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> on the 17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember at <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is not any empty popular Applauſe, or meer ſporting and inſulting Fancy that puts us on this Yearly Trouble and Charge of leading this <hi>Man of Sin</hi> as it were in Triumph to his deſerved Funeral Pile; we have more ſerious Inducements thereunto. For we intend to declare hereby, that the Pope is the <hi>Archi-Traitor,</hi> and the Head-Ingeneer not only of our Civil Combuſtions, but alſo of the Lamentable Firing of this Famous Mother-City of our Country; and that though he in his Emiſſaries made his Eſcape then, from Juſtice (perhaps by the connivance of ſome) yet 'tis but juſt that while we on the one hand do Solemnize the Memorial of our Reſtauration, we ſhould as oft remember them of that Shameful Fact, and that all the Bloody Crew of them ſhould be thus led as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals through our Renewed Streets to Attone for that Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that they deſerve to be burnt in Effigie at leaſt for the ſad burning of Houſes, and Heart-breakings they have cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſed in this very Place. We would likewiſe hereby (in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103142:3"/>
theſe ambiguous times) renew a Holy Indignation in all True Proteſtant Breaſts, and a juſt Abhorrency even in all imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Spectators of thoſe Perſons and that Religion, whoſe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Tenet it is to propagate and maintain it ſelf by ſuch unchriſtian, inhuman, and deſtructive Practices. But we would further manifeſt by this Solemn Cuſtom, That though that Savage Religion hath of late found ſuch Potent Favourers and Abetters in this Nation, yet that there are many more ſtout unbyaſſed Proteſtant Spirits that will appear as in this, ſo on any other more ſolemn occaſion in defence of their King, Conſcience, and Country, to confound any of the rebellious, and ſuperſtitious Exorbitances of the <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi>; which may it be ſaid, not by way of vain provocation, but rather for the keeping of them quiet within bounds.</p>
            <p>In Fine, The main Motive of our expoſing of this <hi>Mock-Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> in all his Toyiſh Jollity, is to undeceive the Rational, or even the weaker ſort of Papiſts and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers thereof, and to fetch to them whom the ridiculeneſs of this Foppiſh Religion they would be at: Silly Fancies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not a ſerious Refutation, and <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Satyrical Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was found to be as effectual to bring down the Romiſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry, as <hi>Luther</hi>'s Gravity of Argument. For can any man of ſence (if he will but a little ſuſpend his Prejudices) imagin, as they do, that the Eſſential and devotious part of Divine Religion conſiſts in theſe poor Rags, Forms, Shapes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Copes, Cooles, Myters, Croſſes, white Shirts, Beads, and ſuch other accumulated Traſh of human and late Fancy: For as Gods Nature is Spiritual and Immenſe, ſo reaſon it ſelf dictated ſo much Goſpel to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Pagans,</hi>

               <p>Here comes the Empreſs <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who was the Popes Miſtreſs by her Luſt, and conſequently the Worlds in her time; ſhe is ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four Nuns, to whom 'tis leſs honourable to be Whores, than to Marry, for Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, that ordained this goodly Vow of Chaſtity for Prieſts and Nuns, had ſome thouſands of Infants Skuls brought before him, that were fiſht out of a Pond ſurrounding theſe Holy Veſtals Monaſtaries; and many ſuch are recorded to have been found here in <hi>England</hi> in Times of Popery.

               <p>Hitherto you have taſted but of the Honey that ſurrounds the Cup of Abomination; now you come to the bittereſt of the Potion; for they Uſher in their Religion with taking Fineries; but the Sting of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition lies in this Serpents Tayl. Here indeed is the main Scene of Antichriſt's Cruelties againſt Chriſtians and Martyrs that dare ſee or ſpeak againſt his Errors, abominable Pride and Wickedneſs. In this Pageant you ſee a Seat of Judicature, whereon ſits a Biſhop as Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-General, and is ſurrounded by other Monks as Inquiſitors-Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; there ſtands a poor Martyr condemned, before them, dragg'd to a Stake, environed with Faggots to burn him, and then put a <hi>Sanbenite</hi>-Cap on his head all painted with Devils; and all the Theatre round about is ſtrewed and hemm'd with Racks and Inſtruments of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
               <p>In this Fatal Pomp the Proceſſion ſets out from <hi>White-Chappel-Bars,</hi> and on through <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> through <hi>Cornhil, Cheapſide</hi> and <hi>Ludgate,</hi> till it comes to <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> where it receives its Sentence to be Burnt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Queen <hi>Beſſes</hi> Throne; and in remembrance of her happy Days, and for the Victories that God gives us in our Days againſt the Pope and his Emiſſaries, the Solemnity is cloſed with Fuzees and artificial Fires.</p>
