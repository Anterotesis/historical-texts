            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To Gentlemen, and those that <hi>are gentle.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SVbiects may seeme scarce, or Printers lacke worke, when a Cormorant flies into the Presse, yet Cormorants oppresse and therefore worthy to be prest; but my Cormorant hath neither dipt his tongue in oile to smooth the faults of the vicious, nor stop'd his mouth to conceale the merits of the vertuous: I haue thought good to sympathize a subiect fit for the time, and I haue done my best to handle it in a sutable straine.</p>
            <p>The Cormorant is not easily induced to affability, nor I to flattery.</p>
            <p>His best seruice is harsh and vnsociable, so is my style. His biting is sharpe and piercing, so is my phrase. His throat is wide and spacious, my subiect is spacious. His co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is blacke, I discouer deeds of darknesse. He grubs and spuddles for his prey in muddy holes and obscure cauerns, my Muse ferrits base debaushed wretches in their swinish dens. He like the <hi>Crocodile</hi> moues the vpper chap, this Treatise condemnes that beasts dissimulation. He swallows downe his meate without taste, this booke distastes such as sinne without touch of conscience.</p>
            <p>The ods is, my Cormorants appetite is limited, but most of theirs is vnsatiable.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:782:3"/>
            <p>I ayme not at such mens slips as may fall by infirmity, for that were like <hi>Esops</hi> crab, to offer to teach others to goe right, going crooked my selfe.</p>
            <p>Detraction is a priuate wounding of a mans name, and flattery a deuourer of men aliue. If I can sayle betwixt these two, and not be split, I shall ariue at my desired port.</p>
            <p>In my passage I shall haue <hi>Polipheme</hi> casting Rockes to sincke me, Criticks misconstruing my words, like spiders sucking poyson out of wholesome flowers.</p>
            <p>But from these Antipodes to goodnesse, by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis to nature, I appeale to my conscience which is a witnesse to me that can neither accuse or condemne me.</p>
            <p>I ayme at none but such as deuoure others, and yet make shift to keepe themselues out of the reach of law, I name none personally, and therefore wish the faulty to amend with silence rather then by rubbing of a spot to make a hole in the whole cloath, for I leaue gleanings enough to make a second part if need require. Such stomacks as cannot digest this dish, let me rather be to them a choake peare then a Gudgeon.</p>
            <p>There is no degree of man or woman, whatsoeuer, from the Court to the Cottage, or from the Pallace to the Plough, but may make good vse of this Poem, either for merry recreation, or vices defamation: and in a word, if it please the iudicious, or be any way profitable to the confirming of the good, or reforming the bad, I have then my full recompence, with the effect of my intentions and wishes.</p>

                  <l>As for his prey his eyes scowld vp and downe,</l>
                  <l>At last he shoulders neare a country Lasse,</l>
                  <l>And cut her purse, as by her he did passe.</l>
                  <l>Shee spide and caught him, and began to raue,</l>
                  <l>Cald him <hi>rogue, rascall, villeyne, thiefe</hi> and <hi>slaue.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Gep with a <hi>pox,</hi> the Cutpurse then replide,</l>
                  <l>Are you so fine you can no icasting bide,</l>
                  <l>I'ue ieasted more with forty honest men,</l>
                  <l>So with a <hi>moraine,</hi> take your purse agen.</l>
                  <l>Another sattin Cutpurse, dawbd with lace,</l>
                  <l>A country Gentleman for's purse did chase,</l>
                  <l>On whom a blew-coat Seruingman did waite,</l>
                  <l>And passing through a narrow obscure strait,</l>
                  <l>The thieuing knaue the purse he nimbly nims</l>
                  <l>And like a <hi>land sharke,</hi> thence by land he swims.</l>
                  <l>The Scruingman perceiu'd the Cutpurse tricke,</l>
                  <l>Said nought, but dogges him through thinne &amp; thick,</l>
                  <l>Vntill the thiefe suppos'd the coast was cleare,</l>
                  <l>As he was pissing Blew-coat cut off's eare.</l>
                  <l>The Cutpurse madly gins to sweare and curse,</l>
                  <l>The other said, Giue me my masters purse,</l>

                  <l>Thus though a Cutpurse trade be counted ill,</l>
                  <l>I say he is a man of action still:</l>
                  <l>Waites on Ambassadors that comes and goes,</l>

                     <hi>Newgate's</hi> his hall, at <hi>Tyburne</hi> hee's made free:</l>
                  <l>Where commonly it so fals out with him,</l>
                  <l>He dyes in perfect health, sound winde and limbe,</l>
                  <l>He in a Coaches elder brother rides,</l>
                  <l>And when his soule and corps, from each diuides,</l>
                  <l>He foules no sheetes, nor any Physicke takes,</l>
                  <l>But like a bird in'th ayre an end he makes:</l>
                  <l>And such an end I wish they all may haue,</l>
                  <l>And all that loue a shifting <hi>Cutpurse</hi> knaue.</l>

                  <l>So <hi>Serieants</hi> snare mens bodies for the Iayle,</l>

                  <l>(But first the prisoner drawes without delay,</l>
                  <l>A sop for <hi>Cerberus</hi> that turnes the key.)</l>
                  <l>Then the old prisoners garnish doe demand,</l>
                  <l>Which straight must be discharged out of hand.</l>
                  <l>But if he cannot pay, or doth denye,</l>
                  <l>He thrusts him in the <hi>hole,</hi> there lets him lye.</l>
                  <l>If a good prisoner hath a well-linde purse,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Iaylor</hi> then esteemes him as his nurse,</l>
                  <l>Suckes like a <hi>Bulcalfe,</hi> and doth neuer cease</l>
                  <l>Till with much griefe he heares of a release.</l>
                  <l>An Vnder-keeper, (though without desert)</l>
                  <l>Is a continuall knaue in spight on's hart:</l>
                  <l>If to the prisoners he be sharpe and cruell,</l>
                  <l>He proues their knaue, and his good masters Iewell:</l>
                  <l>If vnto them himselfe he well behaue,</l>
                  <l>He is their Iewell and his Masters knaue.</l>
                  <l>So let him turne himselfe which way he can,</l>
                  <l>Hee seldome shall be held an honest man.</l>
                  <l>Perhaps the Iaylor in one stinking rome</l>
                  <l>Hath sixe beds, for the Gallant and the Grome,)</l>

                  <l>VVhich weeklie's eight and twenty shillings right:</l>
                  <l>Thus one foule dirty roome from men vnwilling,</l>
                  <l>Drawes yearly seauenty three pound sixteene shilling.</l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:782:17"/>
                  <l>Besides a <hi>Iaylor</hi> (to keepe men in feare)</l>

                  <l>He and the Serieant may be coupled too,</l>
                  <l>As bane of mankind, for they both vndoe:</l>

                  <l>In comes the <hi>Serieant</hi> for his breakfast then,</l>
                  <l>Drags him to'th Iayle to be new squeezd agen:</l>
                  <l>And thence he gets not, there he shall not start,</l>
                  <l>Till the last drop of blood's wrong from his heart.</l>
                  <l>Yet I haue heard some Serieants haue beene mild,</l>
                  <l>And vs'd their prisoner like a Christians child:</l>
                  <l>Nip'd him in priuate, neuer trig'd his way,</l>
                  <l>As Bandogs carrion, but went faire away,</l>
                  <l>Follow'd aloofe, shewd himselfe kind and meeke,</l>
                  <l>And lodg'd him in his owne house for a weeke.</l>
                  <l>You'd wonder at such kindnesse in a man,</l>
                  <l>So many Regions from a Christian.</l>
                  <l>But what's the cause, Ile lead you out o'th maze,</l>
                  <l>Tis twenty shillings euery day he stayes,</l>
                  <l>Besides the Serieants wife must haue a stroake,</l>
                  <l>At the poore teate, some outside she must soake,</l>
                  <l>Although she tridge for't, whilst good fortunes fall,</l>
                  <l>He shall command house, Serieant, and all.</l>
                  <l>Thus may it come by'th side o'th breeding woman,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Serieants</hi> son's a Gentleman, no yeoman:</l>
                  <l>And whilst they fish from mens decayes and wants,</l>
                  <l>Their wiues may proue foule fleshly Cormorants.</l>
                  <l>Thus a bad <hi>Serieant</hi> and a <hi>Iaylor</hi> both,</l>
                  <l>Are Cormorants which all good people loathe,</l>
                  <l>And yet amongst them some good men there are,</l>
