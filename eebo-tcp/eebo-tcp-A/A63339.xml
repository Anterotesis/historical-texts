            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Account of the Proceedings AT THE TRYAL</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Held at the MARSHALSEAS, on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>17</hi>th. of this instant <hi>February, 1680.</hi> by vertue of a ſpecial Commiſſion Granted by the King, out of the Admiralty, for Trying of Captain <hi>Crompton Guyther,</hi> and <hi>7</hi> of his Men, <hi>viz. William Coles, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Bullivant, Joh. Baxter, Francis Wanſell, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Martyn, John Gibſon and William Jones,</hi> for Piracy by them committed on a Ship belonging to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on the 3d. of <hi>December</hi> last, who were all taken and Pinioned together, and brought before the King and Council, who committed them to the <hi>Marſhalſeas.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THere being a Debt of 151612<hi>l.</hi> agreed on, and ſtated by the King and Council, to be due to the Adminiſtrators of Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> for Damages done unto them by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on 2 Engliſh Ships, Trading to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> His Majeſty was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to Grant unto <hi>Geo. Carew,</hi> Merchant and Adminiſtrator unto the ſaid Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> Letters of Repriſals, on the 19th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>May,</hi> in the 17th. Year of His Majeſties Reign, cauſing them to be made Patents, and were paſſed under the Great Seal of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to remain effectual in Law, until the Summ of 151612<hi>l.</hi> before agreed on, and ſtated by His Maſty and Council, ſhall be reprized and ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>In the year 1667, a Peace was concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. wherein was an Article incerted generally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That all Actions and Pretenſions whatſoever, on either ſide; ſhould by virtue of that Peace be obliterated, diſanull'd, and made void, wherein alſo Letters of Mart, and Reprizals were comprehended.</p>
            <p>In the year 1672, a new War commenced between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and in the year 1674 a common Alliance was concluded, but no reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made or alotted to the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> and others claiming under the ſaid Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar.</hi> Wherefore, and in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of His Majeſties gracious Letters Patents of Reprizal, <hi>Carew,</hi> &amp;c. did in <hi>April,</hi> 1680, fit out to Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to reprize what they could, towards ſatisfaction of the Debt before mentioned; But His Majeſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Council ſent Orders to the Admiralty, to ſtop all ſuch Ships and Men. And His Majeſty did then alſo in Council, by way of <hi>Superſedeas</hi> revoke the ſaid Letters Patents, and Iſſued forth Proclamation accordingly.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, Capt. <hi>Guyther</hi> in the Ship <hi>Bona adventure,</hi> put to Sea; and did on or about the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> following, ſeize a Galliot Hoy, being called the <hi>Love of Rotterdam,</hi> loaden with Wine and Pruans, bound from <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to <hi>Dort. Guyther</hi> being at Anchor in <hi>Cowes Road</hi> with the Prize; <hi>Daniel Gyles,</hi> Marſhal of the Admiralty, retook the ſaid Veſſel from
<pb facs="tcp:51682:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Captain <hi>Guyther,</hi> together with the Commiſſion or Deputation which he had from Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> and brought him with his men <hi>Pinnioned</hi> together as <hi>Pirates</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> who were on the 1<hi>ſt. Jan.</hi> following by Warrant of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, all Committed to the <hi>Marſhalſeas</hi> Priſon in <hi>Southwark,</hi> from whence they were brought to Tryal. Upon which Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> and the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors Arreſted the ſaid <hi>Daniel Gyles,</hi> for taking this Galliot Hoy from Captain <hi>Guyther</hi> in ſo Arbitrary a manner, and without any Legal Warrant for his ſo doing: But the Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> diſcharged <hi>Gyles</hi> on Common Bail, and Prejudged that the Captain and his Men ſhould be Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, notwithſtanding their Actings were by Virtue of the ſaid Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty was gratiouſly pleaſed at the ſpecial inſtance and preſſure of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador, &amp;c. to grant a ſpecial Commiſſion out of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty to Try the aforeſaid Captain <hi>Crompton Guyther, Wil.Coals, Joſeph Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, John Baxter, Francis Wanſel, Francis Martyn, John G<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Liolin Jenkins</hi> being Judge of the Admiralty opened the Cauſe, and did in a very Learned Speech ſet forth the miſcheviouſneſs of the Fact, and how that ſuch Actions if ſuffered might involve the Nation in another War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Great were the debates whether the Priſoners ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Council, which at laſt was granted them. The Witneſſes were produced, but they pleaded Juſtification, and Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> produced his Majeſties Letters Patents of Reprizal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which though very long and tedious was Read and proved very Ample and Circumſtantial: On the other hand his Majeſties Superſedias under the Great Seal, was produced and read, together with his Majeſties Proclamation which did poſitively prohibit and forbid the ſaid <hi>Carew</hi> from any Actings by virtue of the ſaid Letters of Reprizals, as alſo the Articles of Alliance between his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>States General,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that particular which made null and void thoſe Letters of Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
            <p>Great and tedious were the Debates on both ſides for it held from ten in the Forenoon till about four in the Afternoon, and the the Matter ſeem'd to go hard againſt the Priſoners: But Judge <hi>Charlton</hi> turnd the Scale by ſaying, That they did it not with a Fellonious intent, but by Warrant, and after they had taken the Ship, they treated the men thereof civilly, and ſet them on ſhore, and came into harbor: And therefore, he thought them not guilty of the Felony and Piracy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſtood indicted: And declared, That he would waſh his hands from their Bloud. Many particulars there were too teadious here to inſert: Upon which the Jury withdrew, and brought them in Not Guilty both of the Felony and Piracy. And they were diſcharged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, The whole Court were of Opinion, That Mr. <hi>Carew</hi>'s Commiſſion was Void in Law, and would therefore have taken it from him. But Sir <hi>George Tr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
