         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Touching the bounty and goodneſſe of <hi>GOD</hi> in Man's Creation, theſe
things would be known.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>God</hi> in the beginning made Man in <hi>Paradice,</hi> after all his other
works; that he might come as to a <hi>Sumptuous pallace ready furniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That he was made a <hi>compendium,</hi> and abridgment of all the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
as being a <hi>little world</hi> of himſelf; for whereas <hi>Planets</hi> have being, not
life: <hi>Plants</hi> have life, not ſence; <hi>Beaſts</hi> have ſence, not reaſon; <hi>Angels</hi> have
being, life, reaſon, not ſence; <hi>Man</hi> hath all, and contains in him more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
then the <hi>Angels; viz.</hi> being, life, ſence, reaſon.</p>
            <p>3. That as he was made <hi>Lord</hi> of, and had dominion over all; ſo he did
excell all other viſible creatures.</p>
            <p>1. In that he had a <hi>reaſonable ſoul,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In that he hath a <hi>speaking tongue,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In that he was made upright, with his <hi>face lifted up to heavenward,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In that <hi>all things</hi> were made <hi>ſubject to him,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>In that he was</hi> made after the Image of God,</p>
            <p>6. In that his <hi>ſoul is immortal,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>In that he was</hi> ordained to eternal glory.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially we are to know, that as <hi>God</hi> made all things elſe for mans
uſe and ſervice: ſo he created man (male and female) more immediately
for his own honour, and ſervice; and did accordingly adorn him with gifts,
and abilities above all other viſible creatures. For <hi>God made us,</hi> (had not
<hi>we un-made our ſelves</hi>) after his own Image, endowing us (as with reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and immortal ſouls, ſo) with perfection of all true wiſdom, holineſſe,
and righteouſneſſe; writing his Law in our hearts, and giving us ability to
obey, and fulfill the ſame in every point; and withall a power to ſtand, and
for ever to continue in a moſt bleſſed and happy condition, free from all
miſery, and to enjoy a ſweet, and bleſſed Communion with his <hi>Creiter.</hi> So
that man was <hi>created very good,</hi> did clearly and perfectly know the whole
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99130:3"/>
will, and works of his Maker; was able out of the integrity of his ſoul, and
fitneſſe of all the powers; fully, willingly and chearfully to love, obſerve, and
obey his Maker, in every tittle and circumſtance he required, and to <hi>love his
neighbour as himſelf:</hi> ſo that neither the <hi>minde</hi> did conceive, nor the <hi>heart</hi>
deſire, nor the body put in execution any thing, but that which was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and well pleaſing unto <hi>God;</hi> as theſe inſuing Scriptures do plainly

            <p>Which being ſo, how ſhould it humble us, and make us aſhamed of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

before all the reſt of the Creatures in obaying our Creator; as far as he did
make us out-ſtrip them all in ſpiritual and divine excellencies? whereas
hitherto, they have out-ſtript and gone before us in a high degree: as for

whatſoever: in that all the creatures were ordained for our ſakes: <hi>yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

for whom they were all made, moſt ingratefully rebell againſt him. As if
you conſider it rightly, the obedience of inſenſible and bruit creatures unto
the will of <hi>God,</hi> is a great check and reproof unto the diſobedience of man.
<hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> of creatures, and <hi>they</hi> the <hi>loweſt;</hi> yet do they as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

            <p>Even the Son of man, came to give his life a ranſom for many. Mark. 10. 45.
As in Adam all dye, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. 1 Cor. 15. 21, 22. As
by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one,
ſhall many be made righteous, &amp;c. Rom. 5. 18, 19. As by the offence of one, the
fault came on all men to condemnation: ſo by the juſtifying of one, the benefit
abounded towards all men to the juſtification of life. Rom. 5. 18. Unto Jeſus
Chriſt that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in <hi>his</hi> own blood. Revel. 1. 5.
The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all ſins 1 John. 1. 7. he

there ſalvation in any other; for among men, there is given none other name
vnder Heaven, whereby we muſt be ſaved. Acts. 4. 12. The wages of ſin is
death, but the gift of God is eternall life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Rom.
6 23. I am the reſurection and the life, be that believeth in me, although he
were dead, yet ſhall he live. John. 11. 25. You hath he quickned, that

God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt
died for us: much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhal be ſaved from
wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to
God, by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved
