            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nevertheless (to omit other Instances, whether of former or later times) there hath been a company of men in this Nation, noted by the Name of <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men,</hi> or <hi>Quinto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchians,</hi> who have in Sermons and in Printed Writings asserted another way, which is like the barbarous proceedings of Turks, or bloudy Papists, of setting up the supposed visible Kingdom of God by bodily weapons, fighting against all the present Civil Powers on Earth as Antichristian, and in most cruel manner killing all that oppose them, and determining this to have been the Generation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55931:5"/>
work they were to prosecute in this Age. By what degrees and means they came to such monstrous Opinions they can best tell, who have been acquainted with them. The cursed effects of such Opinions as have been hatched and vented by the men of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, after sundry other attempts before that time frustrated, brake out in the beginning of <hi>January</hi> 1660. in the City of <hi>London,</hi> a small number of men dementate by those Conceits in a most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid furious manner, making a most bloudy Insurrrection, in a most violent audacious way not to be parallel'd. Those Principles by which they acted and their Practises, were, to my knowledge, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed some years before in some of the Congregations to which some of the Assertors had joined themselves, and they thence so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ejected, and their Doctrine in the Confessions of Faith of those Congregations, and some other Apologetical and Polemical Writings rejected and impugned.</p>
               <p>And after that Insurrection presently those persons who were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to suspition and obloquy as abettting or fomenting that Attempt, by reason of their dissent from the received way of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Rites and Government, did by humble Apologies and otherwise acquit themselves from that crimination. Nevertheless, having met with some of the Writings of the men, whose Principles animated that Rising; and fearing, that there may yet some sparks of that fire lie unquenched, after the publishing of some Writings against the Papists, to shew the insufficiency of their proofs for the Truth, Visibility, Holiness, Infallibility of their Church, Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Pope, the certainty of their unwritten Traditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of receiving the <hi>Trent</hi> Faith, and joining to the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as it is now governed; and some other against <hi>Quakers</hi> about the Light within each man, as an insufficient Rule to guide us to God; about the Oaths of the King's Supremacy and Allegiance to him; and upon that occasion somewhat an ample Treatise about Swearing; asserting, That under the Gospel there is yet a lawfull use of swearing; being now debarred of other Ministerial imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have conceived it a necessary work to shew the weakness of those suppositions, upon which the <hi>Quinto-monarchians</hi> have been drawn to such an hideous practice, as that accursed action foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was.</p>

               <p>THere was a Book printed, made in the year 1656. as is noted pag. 18. bearing this Title, <hi>The Banner of Truth displayed; or a Testimony for Christ, and against Antichrist, being the substance of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Consultations, holden and kept by a certain number of Christians, who are waiting for the visible appearance of Christs Kingdom in and over the World, and residing in and about the City of</hi> London. In the first page of the Epistle Dedicatory are these words: <q>And truly it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that <hi>Rome</hi> and the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> (commonly called the Protestant, but are the Antichristian Countries) which are the streets of the Great City, and <hi>Rome-Babylon,</hi> are the <hi>Akel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama,</hi> or Field of bloud.</q> And some pages after mentioning powers since the rise of the Beast with ten horns and ten crowns, and their success, it is said: <q>Now for that we apprehend, that the present Generation in which we live, is that time in which this great work of Reformation (rending and tearing the very foundations of the Beasts Civil power up by the roots; the fall of the tenth part of Rome's Dominions; a great slaughter amongst the great men and implacable Enemies of Christ; and the final result, the Kingdoms of the world becoming Christ's possession) will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and that time in which the first dispensation of our Lord's Kingdom shall take place; and that it shall not pass before these things be fulfilled: Therefore we are against these Governments as now constituted, and growing upon the old root of wickednesse and bitternesse, that (time out of mind) have brought forth and produced nothing but bloud-Monsters; and to Rule by those Laws that Bastards Tyrants and Conquerors have made for their Lusts sake, in opposition to the Law and the Testimony, <hi>Isay</hi> 8. 20. We cannot contend for any Government whatsoever that is of Mans erecting, building and planting, where any thing of this old Foundation may remain and be left; and which good men, moral men, civil men may exercise upon a meerly civil accompt, (for all men as they are men have lost their rights and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in respect of Government in the first <hi>Adam;</hi> but Saints have regained them in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> or Lord from Heaven) and by force and vertue of mens Laws (though but the best of those
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55931:6"/>
Laws, &amp; those called fundamental, so they are where no more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is found) for the Lord will pluck up and destroy root and branch; and the Lord will not have a stone of <hi>Babels</hi> confused building for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation. We cannot therefore but (as in duty by our Allegiance to this King bound) proclaim, That Jesus Christ is the only lawful and true begotten Heir, and lawful King and Potentate of these three Nations, and of all the Nations of the Earth, and (as he is the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> shall possesse the Earth; yea, and the very Gates of his Enemies; and that the sole Legislative power of the Nations is, and doth of right appertain and belong to him, and shall be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence then it necessarily follows, That those beast-like powers now in being in the world, and those (if any) which shall succeed upon that bottom that Rebel-like will not assign their said power, Crowns and Scepters to this great Monarch, are, and shall be deemed and adjudged Traytors, and proceeded against accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, by vertue of this Kings Laws. And truly we are soberly and humbly bold in the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s strength to assert, That the Saints of the most High (be they who or where they will) and faithfull remnant, are a people distinct from the world, and formal Professors, and are but Pilgrims and strangers in this state of affairs, men of another Kingdom and World; and are by themselves a Common-wealth, and Free-State: and therefore 'tis to be desired, from good and sound grounds, that they would exercise that Royal Authority which God has given unto them, and invested them with, as they are Saints by calling. And upon this accompt we humbly conceive, that 'tis lawful for them to use all honest and just means to defend themselves and offend their enemies; and to contend against those that do or shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them in their work and business, which is according to the pattern shewed unto them in the Mount, and Law of Christ, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and declared throughout the Scriptures. It is observable, that we are even already arrived the overturning daies; we mean those times in which God will begin to smite the Governments and powers of the great Image:</q> which is a little after expressed thus; <q>the total annihilation and subversion of all the powers of this World, of what quality soever, ruling either in <hi>Antichrists</hi> earth, or civil State, or in his Heaven, or Christ-state, by the first dispensation of Christs visible Kingdom, which we have spoken of,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55931:6"/>
or that of the stone. Hence it is, that we bear a constant and publick testimony against powers, as the subject of Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and that which must be plucked up. We expect the Gentile Saints shall begin this great work.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Book it self, having p. 1. said <q>They were resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their way of Consultation for the clearing up these matters of their faith, and principles of their hope, <hi>they thus write,</hi> That there is oppression in the earth in all Nations, as also in <hi>England</hi> at this present time, is undeniable: for, no man can say, that there is no oppression, unless we will also affirm, that there is no Dragon in power, no Antichrist, Beast, <hi>Babylon,</hi> Whore, nor false Prophet; which how absurd a thing it is let all judge. But the Man of Sin is still in the Seat of Authority, &amp; the Governments of these Nations are Antichristian, therefore oppression is not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Neither will there be any lasting Cessation of cruelty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fifth Kingdom be set up; when the whole Earth shall be at rest, and the fourth Kingdom, which divides it self into two Iron legs; ten toes and a little horn, be wholy destroyed in all the Laws, Constitutions, Governments and Reliques thereof; for the Spirit and life that is in that Beast, or Kingdom, is the Spirit of the old Dragon, who is the Devil and Satan, that old Serpent, whose seed do continually war against the Woman, which is Christs Mystical body; there being great enmity between them two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 4. That dispensation which <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by his providence hath cast us under, is, the overturning dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, the time of War, and beating of Plough-shares into Swords, which Christ, and the Scriptures speak of; that day in which Christ will appear in his stone, the stone of <hi>Israel,</hi> against the powers of the world, to the end he may be invested in his possessions, which is the Kingdom and Dominions, and their greatness under the whole Heavens; and therefore we conclude that it is an unlawful thing, and therefore men ought not to contribute to the upholding, and maintaining of those powers which shall be broken by this dispensation, left happily they be found fighters against God. p. 6. The will of man having been corrupted ever since the fall of man, the Lawes that proceed from that will must need be so. p. 11. We say the oppressor which makes us to groan is <hi>Babylon,</hi> in her several parts and powers in <hi>England:</hi> Rulers, Lawyers, Priests and Soldiers; for the present Government in <hi>England</hi> must of necessity be confessed to be either
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55931:7"/>
a part of the ten Horns of the ravenous fourth Beast, or else that wicked little Horn Dan. 7. Because they are the last evil powers that shall be over the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore we may safely conclude this to be an <hi>Assyrian,</hi> else we must conclude him to be a part of that Kingdom, set up by the God of Heaven; but that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, because he rules by the Lawes of his Predecessors, and shall Christ be beholding to Antichrist for Lawes? No certainly; he is of the fourth, and therefore we need not run far to look this oppressor, having already found him to be the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with its dependents, and appurtenances, being a piece of that monstrous Beast, whom the Dragon <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Devil <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 2.) Assignes Power and Seat, and great authority unto, who branches himself into so many Monarchical Governments in the Nations of Europe, and which men would perswade us to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to as being lawful, and of God, but they execute the Laws of Antichrist, and rule for him in Tyranny; oppression and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution by politick Laws which they make, and for which the Priests and Lawyers plead, and mercinary Soldiers and Officers execute. <hi>p.</hi> 12. The persons oppressed, we take it, are the most spiritual enlightned Saints in these Nations, whose spirits and affections are stirred up to follow Christ in the work of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the good interest now contended for, whom we call the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of publick spirited Saints. The administration of Christs visible Kingdom and rule over the Nations is endeavoured to be suppressed in this juncture of time. And not only the thing it self is opposed as dangerous, and endeavoured by <hi>Matchiavil</hi>'s principle, argument and power, as heretical, as monstrous; but the Doctrine and Gospel of that Kingdom and Office of Christ, (which shall be preached for a witness to all Nations) is slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected by self-interested men, and contemned by most. p. 13. They have made a Law that those that shall speak against the powers must be Traytors, which in effect is to make those Traytors that speak for this Kingdom. The conversion of the Gentiles and poor ignorant sinners to the Faith of Christs visible Kingdom is opposed. And p. 14 The establishment of Justice and righteousness in the world: and therfore with us arise for the lot of our inheritance; prepare therefore your victuals, your purse, and your scrip, but especially your sword, though you sell your coat for it. p. 23. The Parliament as being built upon the old foundation was a part of the beast. p. 24. It is clear that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55931:7"/>
of the Stone shall begin to smite the power of the Beast, or Civil power, and that quarrel is begun and taken up and continued chiefly against that power. p. 25. Found to be from Hell and not from Heaven. p. 27. The glass of the beasts powers being almost run out in these Nations, what remains but that the Saints take into their own possession the Kingdom and power (which is their birth-right, as freemen of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Israel, and Heirs of the whole world with Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29.) which the Beast and his powers hath unjustly detained from them some hundreds of years. p. 28. That the work of this Stone is a smiting work, or a work wherein the Saints imployed shall visibly appear in a military posture for Christ, which we call the great combat between Christ and the Kings and Rulers of the world. For the Saints shall fall upon, or smite that great Image, the Feet and Toes thereof, and the whole Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as now divided, or all those powers, whose derivation is from <hi>Rome</hi> (others not excepted nor freed) shall be thereby smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, we mean the Kingdoms of the Romish Iron-legs, or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kingdom divided into the Eastern, and western Monarchies, (wherein the whole Dominion, Power and Monarchy of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Family, or that of the Turks, is comprehended) and the Beasts ten horns, or Antichrists civil powers (equivalent to the ten toes) and also the little Horn, together with all powers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever that shall be found opposers of the Lords Kingdom, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of the golden Babylonish, silver Persian, brasen Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or Iron Roman <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and ch. 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. ch. 17. So that we comprehend the whole Kingdom of Antichrist in the Civil Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical parts thereof made up of Persons and things. p. 29. The fifth Kingdom, which is Christs, with its holy, just and righteous Lawes and Officers must arise with destruction to, and stand up in place of the 4th. Kingdom, and the Lawes and Officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. p. 30. Because it is the purchase of the blood, and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. p. 15. Now then we say, that called the Ordinance of God, proves the Ordinance of the Devil, and though the powers of the great Image might be taken for the Ordinance of God, so long as they kept their pure, civil and unmixed state; so saith <hi>Paul,</hi> the powers that be <hi>(i. e.</hi> the civil powers of old <hi>Rome,</hi> tho a bloody persecutor, and devourer of the creation and good heritage) are ordained of God; yet when the power of <hi>Rome</hi> adulterated from its pure civil state, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55931:8"/>
a mixt Antichristian state, the Beast and a Whore then it is said of that Beastly, Antichristian power, that the Dragon, or Satan gave him his power, and Seat, and great authority; and what then is this save the Ordinance of Hell? God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this by his Spirit from his word, unto a little remnant, who see the rottenness and hellish foundation of all the Civil powers of the Beast. And how great an argument is this also to us that the rise and work of the Stone is near? Which is principally against the Civil power. p. 52. It is certain, that it is a duty in Saints to hate Gods Enemies; yea, and more particularly to hate the Civil, or Beast-like power, because it is that which upholds the great Whore, and is a fighter against Christs Kingly office, even with a perfect hatred, as we see and find a Remnant do at this day. p. 55. The Lord will use, and engage his people to act in, and perform such a destroying work upon the world, as this work of the stone is, namely the total commotion and dissolution of the old Heavens, and old Earth, and all the created powers ruling therein; because it is the decree, determination, promise and appointment of the Father. p. 56. The Lord by these figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expressions, holds forth the dissolution of all old things formal Antichristian Church-state, Ordinances, Worship, Discipline, and Doctrine, all beast-like, wordly Governments, Institutions, Laws, politick Constitutions, Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, the Heavens, and the Earth of all the Nations <hi>Isai.</hi> 5. 30. p. 57. So that Jesus Christ will admit of no competitors, but will have the sole legislative power, and exercise of the chief Magistracy, and be Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount over the whole Earth; and therefore God is engaged to appear with his smiting Stone, to make way for this glorious Mountain of peace. p. 59. That all the blood of Gods people is found in <hi>Babylon:</hi> For they <hi>(i. e.</hi> her Civil powers <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 6, 7.) have shed the blood of the Saints and Prophets <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 6. ch. 18. 24. &amp; 19. 1. Jer. 50. 14. now therefore God by way of recompence &amp; retaliation hath ordained, that the Saints shall be his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which he will execute his vengeance upon the powers of the World, who are all of them Murtherers: accordingly God commands his people (&amp; 'tis their duty to obey) to reward <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> double as she rewarded them <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. and they shall give her blood to drink. <hi>p.</hi> 62. The call which the stone shall have to act in its smiting work, is for the greatest part thereof now perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and fitly applicable to a faithful remnant now extant in <hi>England,</hi> and fulfilled in and upon them, and also seeing that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55931:8"/>
the signes laid down in the word of God, for the time of the end, are in a gr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>at measure now fulfilled, and accomplished in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Remnant; therefore we conclude, and assert, that 'tis lawful and warrantable, and is a duty incumbent for captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sion; and oppressed Saints, to stand up in Gods name and fear, and deliver themselves, and that glorious Gospel of the Kingdom; now by them declared to the world from persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oppression, and that long Captivity and Bondage, which she hath remained in; and to break the Yoak of the oppressor, which is now upon her Neck, according to the word &amp; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Isai.</hi> 52. 2. We are perswaded that the work of the Stone is the present work of this generation, and our present work, and do accordingly exhort the Saints, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise to fall upon the enemy. <hi>p.</hi> 63. The Saints in order to this smiting work shall be converted from all the Civil power and Rule of Antichrist; and the ten Horned Beast, upon which the mystery harlot sitteth. <hi>p.</hi> 65. That it is their duty to withdraw their Hands, Hearts, Affections, Purses, and prayers from the Civil power, or power of the Beast; that they shall quit all their interest, and claim, in, and to the old Heavens, and Earth, and state of things; shall forsake Father Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And shall convert Houses, Lands, Possessions and Enjoyments (comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be prudently beat into Swords and Spears) into one common stock, to be consecrated for the management of this great Affair. <hi>p.</hi> 66. And in such a practise they shall be no loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Christ will give them an hundred fold; even the spoile of all their great and rich Enemies, who are his opposers, and in the end an eternal Crown. The Saints are, with <hi>Moses,</hi> to refuse Court Honour, and favor, and preferment, Egyptians wisdom, Learning, Revenues and great Riches: with <hi>David,</hi> to leave their common duties (as matters of small value, and little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, in comparison of this noble, and worthy imployment) to fight against the Philistines (so are the Civil powers) or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy to the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel. p.</hi> 71 We do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess we cannot be content, or satisfied until Christs Kingdom flourish, but will (in Gods name and strength) press forward till we come to the mark, which is the state of the true rest (so we call that Kingdom and power) where the Saints shall cease from all their labours, in and with Christ. <hi>p.</hi> 69. Doth not the Lord call the Saints to arise also unto the prey? <hi>p.</hi> 71. The work of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55931:9"/>
God against Nations, Provinces, Universities, Corporations, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Townes, Kings, Rulers, chief Captains, mighty Men, in Church and Common-wealth, Enemies of Christ's Kingly Office, shall be the lesson of faithful Saints; the true way will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and made plain, all Rebels, and Traitors, open and prophane, more close pretenders, and formally Godly, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, hatred, in and among his Saints against those several parts, forms, powers of <hi>Babylon;</hi> doleful howling, and mourning among the Merchants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who are the great and rich men whose hearts dwell on the Earth. <hi>p.</hi> 75. The Saints must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate not only from the Romish Universal, National, Provincial, and Diocesan Church-state of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Antichrist; together with their Discipline, Doctrine, Worship and Ceremonies: But also and more particularly (which is most properly a work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to be done by the Saints in order to the smiting work of the Stone) from the national, and parochial Parish Church State and assemblies, forms and classes, of this and other Antichristian Nations; which we call the Politick (and no more than Civil) Stratagem, and cunning invention of Antichrist: to divide unto himself the whole Land for gain, whereby all men to the lowest ranck, are compelled forcibly to contribute to the maintenance of his false Prophet, and so wickedness is established by a Law: Again further from those Churches that are select, &amp; more pure as being seemingly refined, which are the gathered in a pastoral way (reducing things to primitive practise) so far as they are corrupted and adulterated and found opposers of the Kingly Office of Jesus Christ, in and over the whole world; and more especial in the Administration of this part, or dispensation of that Kingdom, to wit, that of the Stone, or War against his Enemies (for even in this generation there be a sort of people, and those we hope godly, that do acknowledge and wait in the expectation of the later, yea, and hold forth the personal appearance of our Lord as King, yet nevertheless oppose and deny, and quite leap over this Stone and its work, thereby endeavouring to render the Saints useless and uncapable of destroying <hi>Babylon)</hi> which must make <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And from those humane, heathenish and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian wayes, means and helps, for the attainment, whereof
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55931:9"/>
men study, &amp; which they practise in the Schools, and Universities of these Nations, as things necessary for the Fitting, Preparing and qualifying a man (how carnal soever) to be a Preacher of the Gospel (as they say) And this, together with the Offer of some large stipend or yearly salary, and fat benefice is their call to Preach: therefore we disown and abominate their qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their call as an accursed thing: Yet mistake us not, we are not against humane learning, and the knowledge of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, but do repute it honourable, good, and commendable; yet when it is abused, and the plea of necessity put upon it, in that habit we utterly declaim against it, as a derogation to the holy spirit, and its Office; who gave out the Scripture, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints them in the hearts of the godly; for all scripture is given by the inspiration of God, and cannot be convincingly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably expounded by mans Art and Learning. <hi>p.</hi> 77. Separation is to be from the parochial Church, and Hireling Ministry of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> their Ordination and Institution: After they have for some time been trained up in the Arts and Sciences of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Universities, they take their several degrees and commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Masters of Art, Batchelors of Divinity, or godliness, and in case they sit long under the skirts of the great Whore, she makes them Doctors in Divinity, Men skilful, and perfect in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Mysteries: These are those that during the defection and apostacy, are the <hi>Rabbies</hi> which look more after the Fleece, than the Sheep; Lording it over Gods heritage: We therefore are against those degrees, Offices, Places, and their vain (which are indeed Blasphemous) Titles, which they arrogate from God, and Jesus Christ, the great Prophet and Teacher of his People. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>p</hi> 79. The enlightened Saints, or the more pure and holy part of those called the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (and which are corrupted) Churches in these Nations, or elsewhere ought to separate and withdraw from the more grosse, dark defiled, and corrupted part of the said Churches, because there are no Churches (or at leastwise very few) of the pastoral way in these Nations, or elsewhere, but have something of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in them; having forsaken &amp; apostatized from the primative and first love; and have, and do in many principles &amp; practise strike hands with the interest of Antichrist, and mystery of iniquity. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2, 3, 4. <hi>p.</hi> 83. Our position we give thus, that in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding time of the mystical numbers, wherein the Stone shall arise,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55931:10"/>
the Saints must disown, and in the strength of God separate from, and (according to that power which God shall give unto them by his Spirit) engage against all, and all manner of Civil power of what quality soever; now lift up over the whole Earth, or any part, Kingdom, Nation, or Corner thereof; together with all its dependents, Upholders, Lawes and Appurtenances whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whose derivation has been from Satan, ruling in all the several Parts, Powers and Forms of the devouring fourth Beast: And which are of and belonging to that Beast, though descended into the very lowest, last and most refined and pretended Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-like power of that Beast: As having their root, and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Satan the great Dragon. <hi>p.</hi> 81, 82. We accompt it a duty for the Saints to separate from all the forms, practises, Doctrines, and spirit of the Antichrist in the world, in their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren in the Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to be plain, we accompt him, and that spirit, which either in act, or deed, wilfully, and obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies the smiting work of our Lords Kingdom Antichristian; inasmuch as that such would alwaies have Christ, his Saints, his cause in and on the earth a sufferer: But the Scripture clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests the contrary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Agreeably to these positions, or rather exceeding them, are the speeches of some whether <hi>Levellers,</hi> or <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> in the first and second part of Pamphlets printed. 1648, 1649. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <q>The creature man was priviledged with being Lord over other inferior creatures, but not over his own kind; for all men being alike Priviledged by birth, so all men were to enjoy the creatures alike without propriety, one more than another. <hi>p.</hi> 3.

Now let us a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our English powers, all that which is called Magistracy, is from the Kings Patent; and his is from the Devil: for the Kings Predecessors, the outlandish Bastard <hi>William,</hi> came to be King by conquest and murther, now murtherers are, saith <hi>Jesus,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Children; for, saith he, the Devil was a murtherer from the beginning, and he abode not in the truth: Now Kings are utterly against the truth, and persecutors of the Saints; for saith <hi>Jesus,</hi> they shall bring you before Kings, so that Kings are enemies unto

It was wickedness in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> in advancing a man, one of their own kind, in the place of a God, and so to Idolize their own flesh above God. <hi>p.</hi> 7.

All those oppressors before named, do live altogether out of Gods way, and in Rebellion to his Lawes: first, because they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a calling, and so are idle, being Vagabonds, and wasters of the creatures by drunkenness, pride, gluttony, and so but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in a Commonwealth, and by their own Law ought to be put into a house of Correction, and to be made work.

Yet the woman hath not had her day upon the Serpent, but there is a time wherein the woman must have a day upon the Serpent to break his head: therefore there is such a Kingdom wherein the Saints of Jesus Christ shall crush all the enemies of Jesus Christ in the world. <hi>p.</hi> 39. The Devil plays his game; thus in the new Testament times, he made men to look for an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Kingdom only, when Christ was about to set up a spiritual Kingdom; &amp; now that Christ would set up an outward Kingdom saith the Devil, look only to the spiritual Kingdom. <hi>p.</hi> 41.

He conceives <q>The work of Christs visible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over the world the work of the present time, one great article of our faith, the work that God doth call his Children to at this day (and he calls upon them from Heaven to attend to) &amp; that they are to expect it before Christ come forth, &amp; bring his Kingdom with him. <hi>p.</hi> 60, 61. He distinguisheth in Christs visible Kingdom, between the Kingdom of the Stone, and of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; this he calls the Kingdom of glory, wherein the Saints shall not work but receive, that the working Kingdom of the Saints wherein Saints are by the Lord imployed to do some notable service against his coming; which is, the breaking down the great Image, the bringing down all his enemies, that when he comes, he may find them his footstool; for he is to fit at the Fathers right hand, until all his enemies be made his footstool; it's a

Kingdom wherein Plow-shaers are to be beaten into Swords, there shall be wonderful use of Swords, Weapons of War, out of <hi>Daniel</hi> 12. 12, 13. He gathers the beginning of each of these. <hi>p.</hi> 62. Truly I look upon it as being a main and principal part of that faith once delivered to the Saints, as touching the fifth Kingdom. <hi>p.</hi> 63. Though this Stone fundamentally is Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet considered as smiting the great Image, it can be no other but Christ mystical, Christ in his members; and the cutting out of this Stone, cannot be meant, as some would have it, of Christs first coming. <hi>p.</hi> 65. Now if it can be made appear, that that, with which the fifth Kingdom doth begin, the work of the great Image, the over-turning the Thrones of the Kings, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Saints, as chief instruments in the management of it; then it follows of necessity, there must be such a thing as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Military power, to be in the hands of the Saints, and that before the day of Christs appearance, they must have this power in their hands, for the performance of that work: and if so, then it's not evil for the Saints and People of God to seek for it, to pray for it, to plead for it, for it's to come into their hands for the doing of their work before the day of Christs appearance.</q> And then endeavours to prove, that <q>this work, with which the fifth Kingdom doth begin, is a work to be performed by Saints, as the chief and principal instruments in the doing of it. <hi>p.</hi> 74. There's the coming forth of Christ, when his enemies by his Saints are made his footstool.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 79. He gives some figues that this work is near at hand, and <hi>p.</hi> 82.

               <head>§ 3. <hi>The Doctrine of smiting Powers is proved from Scripture Precepts to be Wicked.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Doctrine is damnable and Antichristian, as is proved by these Arguments following; whereof the first is taken from those Precepts of the New Testament and the Old, which forbid such disobedience, vilifying, refusing assistance, smiting of Powers over us, Dignities, Officers; but command Honour, Obedience, Assistance, Fear, to Powers, Dignities, and their Laws, and may be thus formed. That Doctrine is damnable and Antichristian which commendeth and urgeth Practises and Actions contrary to the Precepts of Christ, his holy Apostles, and other holy men in the holy Scriptures. This Proposition is of it self manifest, unlesse that be not acknowledged damnable which is condemned by so holy persons; nor Antichristian in a large sense which is flatly opposite to Christ's and his holy Apostles expresse Doctrine. But the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which commendeth and urgeth such disobedience, vilifying, refusing assistance, smiting of Powers, as the words of the fore-cited Authors, called usually <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men</hi> do, is contrary to the Precepts of Christ, his holy Apostles, and other holy men in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures: Therefore that Doctrine is damnable and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved from those Precepts which expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Subjection, Fear, Honour, Assistence to them. Whereof the first is that of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 27. Where our Lord Christ being by the Disciples of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Herodians,</hi> posed with this Captious question, tending to intangle him in his talk; <hi>Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</hi> After the shewing of tribute money, and the acknowledgment that it had <hi>Caesars</hi> Image and inscription, our Lord Christ thence inferring, that it was due to him whose Image and inscription it bare; resolves them, that they were <hi>to render to Caesar, the things that were Caesars;</hi> to wit, Tribute, Honour, and that Subjection which was then given to him as Emperor. Now it is known, that the Emperor, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55931:12"/>
                  <hi>Caesar,</hi> then reigning was <hi>Tiberius Caesar, Luke</hi> 3. 1. Who came to the Empire by wicked practises, and not only led a most vitious and wicked life in uncleanness, and Irreligion, but also was a bloody oppressor of the Senate and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> as may be seen in <hi>Tacitus</hi> his <hi>Annals, Suetonius</hi> in the relation of his life and other Historians. Therefore the Doctrine, that teacheth disobedience, denying of Tribute, Honours, Subjection to Kings and Princes, as being Oppressors, Enemies to Christ, that urgeth hatred, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them is contrary to Christs precept, which requires Tribute, Honours, and Subjection to be given them, though by wicked waies obtaining Empire, and most wickedly ruling, and putting Christ himself to death.</p>
               <p>The next text is that full and plain precept of the Apostle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Where St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of <hi>every Soul,</hi> therefore of the most inlightned Saints, to <hi>be subject to the Higher, or Supreme Powers;</hi> who are termed v. 3. <hi>Rulers,</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi> such as <hi>bear the Sword.</hi> v. 4. Therefore Civil Magistrates, who had power of punishing even with death, who were <hi>revengers unto wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> and might <hi>praise them that did well;</hi> therefore they were the Persons who had rule, who are meant by powers; for such actions are only of Persons: it is not said the powers that should be, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the powers that are</hi> in being, though by evil means attaining it, and <hi>be that beareth the Sword,</hi> not he only that ought to bear the Sword, but he that hath it in Possession, though perhaps not rightly acquired; nor is it said, every soul is to be Subject to the powers that are such as they should be, but <hi>which are,</hi> nor to be good Rulers only, but <hi>Rulers,</hi> nor he that useth or beareth it aright, but he <hi>that beareth the Sword,</hi> unto these the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle requireth Subjection <hi>of necessity.</hi> v. 5. And that necessity he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth to be not only, because they can inflict wrath or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is expressed. v. 4. But <hi>also for conscience sake,</hi> that is, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>For conscience towards God,</hi> out of regard to Gods Ordinance. v. 1, 2. Who by his Providence for mans good sets up and disposeth of those powers, and also commandeth them to be owned as by his appointment; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies precept as well as Providence, like as compound Nouns of the same theme do. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14 <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to these Powers, or Rulers, the Apostle supposeth the paying of Tribute, as the constant use of Christians, that then were, and that of right; for they <hi>were Gods Ministers,</hi> or <hi>servants attending continually, unto this self same thing,</hi> that is, <hi>their Good.</hi> v. 4. And therefore due to them, as wages for their service
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55931:13"/>
to them, and wages that God assignes them, as being his servants in keeping Peace, Order, righteousness among men, instead of God, who claims this to be his Office, and Substitutes Civil Rulers to do it for him, and to receive their Tributes and Customs, as his receivers. And therefore the Apostle requires. v. 7. Christians <q>to render to all their dues: Tribute, to whom Tribute is due, Custome, or toll, to whom Custome is due; Fear, to whom Fear belongeth, Honour, to whom Honour appertains;</q> whom the <hi>series</hi> of the context plainly shewes to be the <hi>Higher Powers, Rulers, that bear the Sword,</hi> which can be meant of no other than Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and Governours, such as Emperors, Kings, Senates, and Officers, which either make or execuse Lawes, belonging to the Civil state. Now sure if Subjection, Tribute, or Poll-mony, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, or Toll for Commodities, Imported, or Exported, Fear, or Reverence of their Persons and Authority, and Honour, in respect of their preeminence and dignity, be to be given to them; then it is contrary to the Apostles Doctrine to teach disobedience, contempt, withdrawing assistence from them. The reasons which the Apostle gives of Subjection to Powers, are also of much importance for the Confirmation of the Obligation that lies on Christians to yield them Obedience, Tribute, Fear of offending them, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Persons and place; 1. because they are <hi>Powers:</hi> now if there be no Subjection, they are not powers. 2. They are <hi>Higher, Supreme,</hi> or <hi>Excelling power,</hi> therefore those over whom they are, are to be Subject to them, or Ordered under them; or else they Usurp anothers place. 3. They <hi>are of God,</hi> and what is of God should be owned, not opposed. 4. They are <hi>Ordained,</hi> or <hi>Ordered of God,</hi> both by his wise Providence disposing of such imparity, that there may be good order in humane society, if all were equals, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sooner bringing confusion, and hindering common good, as is apparent in Armies (from whence that word we translate <hi>Ordained,</hi> seems to be taken) all right order requiring first and last, highest and lowest, without which no useful frame, either artificial, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, can be erected, or made; and also by his holy and just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which requires superiors in place and power to be Honoured, Feared, Assisted and served by inferiors. 5. Hence the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that resistence of them is <hi>resisting of Gods Ordinance,</hi> &amp; therefore it must needs be a great sin, not only to destroy them, smite them, but also to withstand their power, or by contempt, or subtraction of due aid or subsidie to weaken them; or to provoke them to anger, because it is contending against God. 6. The Apostle upon the same
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55931:13"/>
reason denounceth <hi>Damnation,</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi> from God, on them that do resist. For, as it is <hi>the Ordinance of God</hi> that is resisted, so is it the <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Damnation</hi> of God which is threatned to be inflicted, in which respect as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is used. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. without mentioning God, so it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2, 3. with mentioning of him. 7. Subjection is further urged, and resistence is condemned. v. 3. from the use of the Powers, or Rulers, who are not only by Office, but also in act, <hi>not a terror to good works, but to evil.</hi> For though it were true those Rulers that then were, in matters of Religion, and in things that pertained to their own profit and lust, were towards some a terror to good works, and abettors of many wicked and injurious practises; yet in the general, they did not terrifie sober, industrious, and peaceable persons, but those who did actions contrary to them, and did reward and praise them that were useful for the Common-wealth; and therefore they that did well, as Saints, or Christians should do, they had no reason out of fear to resist them, but in well doing to expect praise from them. 8. From their deputation from God to do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 6. The Apostle argues further the necessity of subjection to them, and the impiety of resisting them, telling them, that the Ruler was <hi>God's Minister</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, three times he gives him these titles, and that to do justice for him; and therefore he that resists him, resists God, and this cannot be with impunity, God not permitting his <hi>bearing the Sword for him to be in vain;</hi> but so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it, that he is, and shall be an <hi>Avenger unto wrath unto him that doth evil.</hi> All these Arguments whereby the Apostle enforceth his Precept, both for the positive part, requiring subjection, and the negative denying resistence, do shew, that the Apostle was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in pressing this duty of subjection to civil Magistrates: which it is probable he did the more importunately urge in this Epistle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was written to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were Inhabitants in that City, where were most oppressions and villainies committed of any part of the world; and in that time, whether in <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi>'s reign, in which the Powers that were, the <hi>Caesars,</hi> or Emperors and Rulers under them, were as monstrously vitious, wicked, unrighteous, tyrannous and cruel enemies to Christians, as in any time; and therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Christians might be tempted to think, that sure they were not to be subject to such, but were to resist them.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the Apostle only in this place urge the duties of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and non-resistence of Civil Powers, but also strictly injoins <hi>Titus</hi> in his Epistle to him c. 3. 1. to put the Christians over whom he was, in mind of this, <hi>that they should be subject to Principalities and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55931:14"/>
Powers, to obey Magistrates;</hi> intimating thereby, that Christians had need to be minded of it, because it was a necessary duty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing provocations to the contrary.</p>
               <p>To these Precepts of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> I shall add the plain Precepts of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist. c. 2. v. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. where he thus chargeth Christians: <hi>Submit yours<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Honour all men; love the Brotherhood; fear God, honour the King.</hi> In which words S. <hi>Peter</hi> commands <hi>subjection to every Ordinance of man,</hi> where as the Adversaries forbid subjection to any humane Creature or Ordinance, <hi>any Government whatsoever that is of mans erecting, building and planting.</hi> The Apostle bid, <hi>be subject for the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> said to the Judges, 2 Chron. 19. 6. <hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgement;</hi> but the Adversaries say, subjection is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord: The Apostle bids <hi>submit to the King as supreme,</hi> or <hi>excelling;</hi> they say, submit not to the King, he is not supreme, nor excels; none hath any just title to rule now; Kings are from the Dragon, the worst of men; the Saints are to smite them: he saith, <hi>Submit to Governors, as unto them that are sent by him;</hi> they say, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not to them, because sent by him, for they and all that own them are Antichristian: The Apostle saith, <hi>they are sent by him for the punishment of evil d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now it is to be observed, that the <hi>Caesars,</hi> Powers, Rulers, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, who then bare the sword, the Kings and Governors then sent by the King, were the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors under them, who were all of them great Idolaters, took the Title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> as being chief about the Idol service of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and other Heathen Gods, none of them Christians by

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55931:15"/>
seems the more likely, that he did not perceive him to be High Priest, because he directs his speech to them with the same compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as he did <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 1. under the titles of <hi>Men and Brethren,</hi> without distinguishing him from the rest, or any respective speech to them as a regular Court of justice, but as a company gathered together by the chief Captain to accuse and examine him, not to judge him. Which is the more likely, by reason of what he did v. 6. in bespeaking them under the title of <hi>Men Brethren;</hi> and, perceiving them to be of different parties, he used art to set them at variance, and to break up the Assembly in a confused manner, which he would not have done, had it been a Court legally set. However we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> knowledge of <hi>Ananias,</hi> it is clear that he doth not impute his speech v. 3. to Prophetick liberty, as <hi>Grotius</hi> imagines when he saith in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 3. <hi>utitur jure Prophetae,</hi> nor justify it, but corrects it, and imputes it to his ignorance, and adds the command of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>For it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> following therein the Greek version, the whole verse being, <hi>Thou shalt not revile the Gods,</hi> that is, as is conceived, Judges, or God, <hi>nor curse the Ruler of thy People.</hi> Which being alledged by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as in force, and applyed to himself, as thereby condemning his speech of opprobrious and threatning language, if it were not excused by his ignorance, doth plainly prove, that a Ruler of the People, though an Ecclesiastick, and climbing to the place by indirect means, unrighteously judging, opposing the truth, the Kingdom and Apostle of Christ, yet should not be reviled, or with menaces terrified, or cursed, but being in the possession of a Rulers place be regarded in words and actions as a Ruler. To which I shall add some more passages of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>St. Pauls</hi> allegation of this shewing, that they are moral, and still binding Christians. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Curse not the King, no not in thy thought, or conscience, and curse not the rich in thy Bed-chamber: for a bird of the ayr shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</hi> Eccles. 8. 2. <hi>I counsel thee to keep the Kings commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of God.</hi> Out of all which I conclude, that the <hi>minor</hi> of my argument is sufficiently proved, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which commendeth and urgeth such disobedience, vilifying, refusing assistance, smiting of Powers, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical, or military, as th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>AGainst this Argument which overthrows also the Doctrines of Jesuited <hi>Pontificians</hi> and other opposers, deposers, and smiters of Kings and other Rulers, there are sundry exceptions taken. One exception is, that those Precepts were for that time, when the Christians were unable to resist. But this is prevented by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</hi> Another, that these Precepts tie us to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to these Rulers, and not to resist them, till they cease to be Rulers, which they do when excommunicate, deprived by the Pope. But if the Pope be comprehended under <hi>every soul,</hi> as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> conceived even the Apostles were, then the Pope himself is to be subject to Rulers, and consequently cannot depose them; nor hath the Scripture given this power to the Pope, or Man, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, it being God's prerogative, as is said <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 7. <hi>God is the Judge, he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</hi> Another eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, that subjection is required to Rulers, while they are a terror to evil works, &amp; not to good, but not when they oppresse, are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Gods People, Christ's Kingdom, then they cease to be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; but this is prevented by the Apostle, who saith, <hi>the Powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> and therefore to them, as they are, subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be given; and resistence is forbidden by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> But the chief exception is that which <hi>p.</hi> 51 of the <hi>Banner displayd</hi> is in these words: <q>Now then we say, that called the Ordinance of God, proves the Ordinance of the Devil; and though the Powers of the great Image might be taken for the Ordinance of God, so long as they kept their pure, civil, and unmixed state; so saith <hi>Paul,</hi> the Powers that be <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Civil Powers of old <hi>Rome,</hi> tho a bloudy Persecutor, and devourer of the Creation, and God's Heritage) are ordained of God; yet when the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> adulterated from its pure civil state, and becomes a mixt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian state, the Beast, and a Whore, then it is said of that beastly, Antichristian Power, that the Dragon, or Satan gave him his power, and his seat, and great Authority; and what then is this save the Ordinance of Hell?</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I reply, If I understand them aright, this is their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the powers of the great Image that is the Kings, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55931:16"/>
and Rulers of the world then ceased to be Gods Ordinance, and became the Ordinance of Hell, when that was fulfilled, which we read <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 2. which they take for granted was, when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the ten Kings that arose out of the division of it, did <hi>give their power and strength,</hi> as it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>unto the beast</hi> mentioned v. 11. which it's without doubt with them to be the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Romes</hi> pretended supremacy, dominion, Oecumenieal Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by which Christian Religion was corrupted, mixed with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganish, and Jewish rites, and the ten Kings and their Kingdoms made dependent on the Pope. And consequently subjection, and assistance is not due to the Civil, or Ecclesiastical, or Military powers or Laws that now are, being built or erected upon the old founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fourth Monarchy in this supposed mixt estate, but they are warranted and bound, as being the Stone expressed <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 44, 45. to smite, destroy, utterly dissolve the powers of the fourth Monarchy (which they conceive to be all the present) in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Offices, Laws, Titles, priviledges and whole constitution, and to take to themselves all the power and dominion in the earth in order to the erecting of the Fifth-Monarchy, which they call Christs visible Kingdom upon earth.</p>
               <p>Now surely such a monstrous giant-like claim as this, exceeding any of the proud claims of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or any of the <hi>Persian, Roman Turkish</hi> Monarchs, had need of very good cards for it, some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Charter or grant of Heaven, especially when it so flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposeth such plain precepts as I have alledged to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which unless they be proved to be relaxed or repealed by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine sentence, testified by some infallible evidence of miracles or otherwise, such as Christ and his Apostles had, do prove, that this claim, and the Doctrine that teacheth such practises, as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to, is from the Devil himself, who is the great <hi>Abaddon,</hi> or destroyer of the World. Sure Christ, when he bid his Disciples <hi>teach men to observe all that he had commanded,</hi> promising, <hi>to be with them all daies unto the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28. 20. And <hi>S.

               <p>NEvertheless let us examine what they say, of which some things are supposed, some things are inferred. The things sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and inferred are these: <q>1. That the fourth Kingdom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</q>

Is the Roman Empire; which I will not deny, though there be not a few very learned men, that take the fourth Monarchy to be the Empire of the successors of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and that upon such reasons, as might make sober men not too peremptory in the contrary opinion, much less to make the future smiting of it an article of faith, and the visible Kingdom of Christ to succeed it. <q>2. That the Kingdom mentioned to be set up <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. shall be an external visible Kingdom on earth;</q> which is yet more doubtful, being more controverted among godly learned men: and that upon such weighty considerations on both sides, as may make considerate men, if not to suspend their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet not too resolutely to assert it, nor obtrude it with such zeal, as the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> do, as an article of faith, and build such mighty attempts, commotions in the world, and hopes on so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55931:17"/>
uncertain a foundation. 3. That, <q>In the daies of these Kings must be meant at the end of the fourth Monarchy, when all the materials of the Image shall be broken in pieces, and scattered so as no place was found for them:</q> Whereas it is far more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it was set up when Christ began to Preach the Gospel, as <hi>John Baptist</hi> and our Lord intimated, when he invited men <hi>to repent and believe the Gospel, for the Kingdom Heaven was at hand;</hi> very likely alluding to those places in <hi>Daniel</hi> ch. 2. 44. <q>In their daies the God of Heaven shall set up a Kingdom, which shall never be destroyed,</q> and therefore called <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> to distinguish it from the Kingdoms of men set up by them, not by the God of Heaven; whereto the like is <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. And seems to be referred to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom of Christ, which <hi>the Saints of the most High do take,</hi> as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ch. 12. 28. saith, <q>Wherefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have, or hold fast, grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and Godly fear;</q> which no man doubts, to be meant of the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of Christ, by faith in him, upon the Preaching of the Gospel. 4. <q>There is a distinction made between the Kingdom of the Stone, and the Kingdom of the Mountain, as if they were either several Kingdoms, or at least of several conditions and qualifications;</q> whereas the text doth distinguish them no otherwise than in their extent, not one spiritual, the other visible &amp; external, the one the working Kingdom, the other the Kingdom of glory. <q>5. That the Stone, which must do the smiting and breaking work, is not Christ personal only, but also Christ <hi>mystical with his members,</hi>
                  </q> or to use the words of Mr. <hi>Tillinghast,</hi> 
                  <q>Though this Stone fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally is Christ himself, yet considered as smiting the great Image, it can be no other but Christ mystical, Christ in his Members.</q> But sure in this they are mistaken, this work being made in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Christs own peculiar work, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 42, 43, 44. <q>Jesus saith unto them, did ye never read in the scriptures, the Stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the Corner? This is the Lords doing, and it is Marvellous in our eyes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

                  </q> In which passage it is apparent that by the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> (which is to be conceived the same with that <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44.) is meant the Kingdom which was then among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was no other

than the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, and <hi>the Stone,</hi> whose work is <hi>to grind to powder,</hi> or <hi>dash to pieces,</hi> (which is to be conceived to be the same, with the <hi>smiting and breaking, Dan.</hi> 1. 34. 44.) is that Stone, which was rejected by the builders, and should become the head of the Corner; which is no other but Christ personal, who was crucified by the Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but raised up from death and set at Gods right hand; and so became the Corner Stone of Gods spiritual House or Church, as it is expresly expounded by <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 4. 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And of him it is said, <q>that he shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working, whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself,</q> 
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21. 6. It is supposed, <q>that this smiting work shall be by military Power, or by fighting:</q> Whereas, <q>if the cutting of the Stone out of the Mountain, be the setting up of the Kingdom, it must be <hi>without hands,</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55931:18"/>
He that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations (And he shall Rule them with a Rod of Iron: as the Vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers) even as I received of my Father:</q> It is to be understood of their prayers, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 8. 4, 5. <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 5, 6. as <hi>James</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 11. Not of Arms, and Armies, he that reads <hi>Revel.</hi> 16 and 19. Chapters, wherein is foretold the destruction of the Beast, and the false Prophet, may see more reason to conceive that Christ will do it by Plagues, as God did the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> or some other invisible way without the Saints; or if he use the Saints, he will do it by their Prayers and Testimonie, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fighting. And therefore if it were granted; That that, <q>with which the fifth Kingdom doth begin, the work of the great Image, the overturning the Thrones of the Kings is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Saints, as chief instruments in the mannagement of it; yet it is not true, which Mr. <hi>Tillinghast</hi> saith in his 3. Sermon <hi>p.</hi> 65. Then it follows of necessity, there must be such a thing as the Civil and Military Power to be in the hands of the Saints, and that before the day of Christs appearance, they must have this Power in their hands, for the performance of that work.</q> So that notwithstanding this pretence, <hi>it is evil</hi> and horribly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for them that have called themselves, <q>the Saints and People of God, to seek for it, to pray for it, to plead for it, as the <hi>Fifth Monarchy Men</hi> have done,</q> contrary to the plain precepts of Christ and his Apostles, seeking for it by killing innocent men, under pretence of praying to God, and keeping fasts, cursing their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and pleading by revilings, and false accusations, and most horrid pervertings of holy scripture, and self magnifyings for a power, not belonging to them. 7. It is supposed, <q>that if the smiting work be to be done by men, it must be by Saints in their Notion.</q> But there is no proof of this, or rather the words of scripture do plainly tell us; that the work is to be done by those Kings, which they conceive, they should destroy as Antichristian, in order to the setting up of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy.</hi> For thus we read <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16, 17. <q>And the ten Horns, which thou sawest upon the Beast, these shall hate the Whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts, to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their Kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</q> So that whereas these men imagin such an inconsistency with Gods purpose and glory to use the Kings and Governments, which have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55931:18"/>
supported the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> for her ruine, and therefore incite men to such hatred, and emnity against them, and with much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, stomack, and bitter zeal; not knowing what spirit they are of, do vilify, inveigh against, and curse them, and seek their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abolition, glorying, like frantick men, in their own satanical spirit and designs, they should rather endeavour to do such things as might make Princes favour them, and hate the Whore; and rather admire, bless and magnify the Providence and work of God, in using them as instruments to pull her down, whose Predecessors out of their blind devotion, set up the Whore, and to protect the servants of God, who were by their Ancestors destroyed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is supposed <q>that this smiting work is to be done by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Saints, who are such as they have characterized them.</q> But this hath no evidence to prove it. For though I will not exclude the Gentile Saints from being meant <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 18. 21, 22, 25, 27. Yet it is very probable (which <hi>Junius, Piscator</hi> and others observe) that by Saints in those places are specially meant the Jewish People, called, ch. 8. 10. <hi>The host of Heaven</hi> v. 24. <hi>The holy People,</hi> or <hi>People of the holy ones</hi> ch. 9. 15, 16, 19, 24. <hi>Gods People,</hi> 
                  <q>and their City <hi>Jerusalem</hi> called by Gods name, his Sanctuary, the holy City,</q> ch. 11. 28. 30. The holy Covenant, ch. 12. 7. the holy People. Yea sundry of those, that are much followed in this argument (as Mr. <hi>Mede Comment.</hi> on <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 12.) do conceive, that by <hi>the Kings of the East</hi> who shall have <hi>their way prepared</hi> for expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Beast; are meant <hi>the Jews.</hi> And sundry Prophecies there are in the Old and New Testament, which do seem to foretel <hi>the Kingdom to be restored to Israel,</hi> according to the question <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6. And therefore the more likely, when they are converted to Christ, if any Saints on Earth, to be chief instruments of destroying <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> which hath oppressed them, Or that fourth Kingdom, which hath been <q>as strong as Iron, and broken in pieces and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all.</q>
               </p>

The fifth Kingdom which is Christs, with its holy, just, and righteous Laws, and Officers must arise, with destruction to, and stand up in the place of the fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Laws and Officers thereof</q>] shew to be the Laws, Constitutions, Governments and orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and they assert a Legislative Power, to make Laws to govern the Nations only in Christ, and his Laws and Officers only are to have place; and in the Book entituled <hi>The Standard set up,</hi> Printed 1657. <hi>p.</hi> 15. they say <q>That the Scriptures (being given by Inspiration of God with his Holy Spirit) are the revealed will and Rule of this Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator, to be constantly owned, and submitted unto in times of War and Peace, as a constant standing Rule for the inward and outward man (wherein are Laws, Statues, Precepts, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for all cases, conditions, and actions of Civil, Military, and Spiritual concerns, either in particular, or more general terms;) For so they were to the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> the only type of the Lambs Government.</q> But these suppositions in a great part are notoriously false. For the Government by King, Lords, and Commons, as it is constituted in <hi>England,</hi> is quite different from old <hi>Rome,</hi> whether under the <hi>Caesars</hi> or Popes, not derived from them, but from the <hi>Saxons</hi> of <hi>Normans,</hi> or some other of the ancient Rulers of this Island; nor are the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> by which it is governed in civil Affairs, the Laws of the Emperors, which are that which we call the Civil Law, consisting of the Edicts and constitution of Roman emperors; nor the Canon Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55931:19"/>
of Popes Decrees and Decretals: but the Common and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws of these Nations, which he that reads the Chronicles of <hi>England,</hi> the Writings of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambdens Britannia,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cookes</hi> Institutes, the Preface of Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> to his Irish Reports, the Book of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, may easily perceive to have another original, and to be much different from them. If there were no more but the daily practice of the Courts of Justice, and the manner of choosing &amp; making Judges and Officers to refute this Calumny, it were enough to shew the grosse falshood of this supposition. And yet, were the Laws and form of Government the same with old Rome, they were not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichristian, and we released from obedience to them: For, not only Christ and his Apostles required obedience to them, but also S. <hi>Paul</hi> both made use of them, and commended them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 37. and 22. 25. and 25. 10, 11, 16. which if they had been Antichristian, (as they give out clamorously, but ignorantly) and to be opposed with greatest hatred, doubtlesse they would not have done.</p>
               <p>As for the other part of the supposition, though we grant, that our Lord Christ is the supreme Legislator, and wherein he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined any thing his Laws are to stand in force, above and against all constitutions and Laws of men, yet we find not that Christ did, or intended to make any particular Laws for thousands of things which pertain to Civil Government, no, nor for many things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Gods worship and Church-Government, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a determination by some Laws or Rules for good order to be kept thereabout. When <hi>one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my Brother, that he divide the inheritance with me; he said unto him, man, who made me a Judge or divider over you? Luk.</hi> 12. 13, 14. Nor did the Apostles, or the Governors after them, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as such, intermeddle with making laws or judging civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, any farther than they were intrusted either by the Roman Governors, or according to Christs appointment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. or the Apostles directions about composing differences between Christians. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. &amp;c. or the exercise of Ecclesiastical censure, or miraculous power did require. Though it is not to be denied that in aftertimes too much of this work was either commited by Christian Emperors, or assumed by the Rulers, and Governors of Christian Churches, especially by Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of Christianity.</p>
               <p>As for the holy Scriptures, though we acknowledge their suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency for a rule in matters of Faith and holy life, in order to the

end wherefore they were inspired of God, to wit, the honouring and serving of God, and our own salvation: yet we do not find in them sufficient Laws in particular for the governing of all civill Commonwealths, but that Judges and Officers (notwithstanding what we find in the books of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And this was thought so necessary, that God erected a Senate among them, with strict injunction to the Jews <q>to do according to the sentence, which they of that place (which the Lord shall choose) should shew them, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to do according to all that they informed them,</q> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 10. which was in effect all one as to impower them to make Laws for them. Sure notwithstanding the written Laws of <hi>Moses, Solomon</hi> had been at a stand how to give sentence in the case of the two Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, had not God given him an extraordinary Spirit <hi>of wisdom to do Judgment,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 28. Nor can the Mosaical or Jewish Laws fit the government of this Nation, unless there were the same distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Lands, the same State of People, and neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the same manner of Trade and living as they had. And it is to be considered, whether this asserting of the Laws of the Jews as a constant standing rule to us Gentiles, be not indeed the same error of Judaism, which was condemned by the Synod at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, Acts</hi> 15. and the writings of the Apostles, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Heresy, which did evacuate the benefit of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty, which Christ hath purchased, by losing of which we may forfeit our interest in Christ, and their Lawes be so far from being the only Lawes fit for the Government of Christs Kingdom, that they may in many things be most unfit, and contention for them to be imposed on gentile belivers more justly to be counted Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, than the Civil Lawes of the Nations, which they so much oppose as Antiehristian, nor can those Lawes be fitted for the Kingdom of Christ, which they look for: For that Kingdom will be, when all Christs enemies shall be made his Footstool, Christ shall personally raign, as they conceive, on earth, it shall be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which shall have a <hi>s<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this supposition, and the inference that is made thereupon, is false, and insufficient, and it would be not only a sin against God, but also a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream degree of wickedness to destroy our Lawes, Records, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this pretence, and all men are truly bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to defend them, and to oppose those as Antichristian, and Enemies to Christs Kingdom, who would disanul them. As for <hi>the Common-wealth of Israel, its being the only type of the Lambs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Gal.</hi> 6. 16. it is so in respect of the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, in which believers are <hi>an holy Priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ, a Royal Preisthood to shew forth Gods praises,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. 9. and, if this reason be of validity to tie us to their Lawes, it will tie us to the Lawes about the Jewish Temple, Priesthood, Sacrifices, and the rest of the Ceremonial Lawes; which were to reduce us from Christ to <hi>Moses,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Judaism. As then it was a pretious benefit, which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel brought, that the Gentiles were not tied to those particular Lawes of Religious service, which were required of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>the Yoke was not put upon the Neck of the Disciples, which neither the Fathers, nor the Apostles were able to bear, Acts,</hi> 15. 10. but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things even in Gods worship were to be determined by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Rulers, according as might best fit the service of God, with respect to the condition of several people: so much more in Civil affairs, it was the great goodness of God, and a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the furthering of Christs Kingdom, among the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Gospel did not impose on the Nations, either the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical, or any other particular Lawes, or Civil Government: but left them to their own Lawes and Government in such things; and required Christians to submit to them, without which there is no likelihood, Christianity had been embraced as it was, nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to have subsisted, and been multiplied among infidels, as they were. And therefore whereas the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> have made such great stirs, as they have done, not only for a reformation in Ecclesiastical discipline, and worship, but also to bring the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Lawes Civil to the Jewish platform in the holy scriptures, (which is their <hi>Diana)</hi> they have therein followed their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not the holy scriptures, but to the great wrong of the Church of God, and injury to his name and truth, caused <hi>many to

Now sure what ever it were, that after the Civil powers of <hi>Rome</hi> assumed, or did, it is certain, that they were, as it is confessed, <q>the powers of the great Image, bloody persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and devourers of the creation, and Gods Heritage,</q> and I may add, as wicked and impure in their lives, as they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yea and as Monstrously Idolatrous, as afterwards. The Emperors then took to themselves the Title of <hi>Pontifex, Maximus,</hi> which was kept till the Christian Emperors time, and that Title imported their power and inspection about the Idolatrous rites of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whereby they took charge of the worship of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and other <hi>Roman</hi> Deities, and were zealous for it so as to persecute them to death with extream cruelty, who would not offer incense to their Idols, nor swear by them; yea they did some of them urge

Jews and other people to worship either themselves or their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as Gods, as <hi>Caligula, Domitian,</hi> and <q>caused the abomination and desolation spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, to stand in the holy place, of which our Saviour foretels,</q>

And though the Popish Idolatry in the worshiping of the Host, bowing down to Crucifixes, Images, praying to deceased Saints, creeping to Crosses, adoring of Reliques and other superstitions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists be horribly impious, and their cruelty in destroying them that will not adore their consecrated Host, be very satanical, and so their power and the exercise of it whereby they take on them to condemn as Hereticks them that will not worship their Idols, and whereby Princes at their beck do execute their sentences cruelly, be from Satan, or the Dragon in the use of it in these things, yet it is doubted whether the Popish Idolatry be greater, or so bad as the Heathenish Idolatry of the <hi>Romans</hi> in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> time. Yea Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> in his <q>Answer rejoined to the reply to Dr. <hi>Morton's</hi> defence of the Ceremonies, ch. 4. sect. 28. <hi>hath maintained against Mr. Parker,</hi> that the popish Idolatry is not as vile in it self as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any of Turks or Pagans.</q> And it is plain, that in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the power of the Emperors, as they used it in persecution of Christians for not worshipping Idols, is ascribed to the Divel before the pretended mixt Antichristian state, as well as after. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Behold the Divel shall cast some of you into prison,</hi> when he did it by the Pagan Emperors and their Officers. v. 13. <q>I know thy works and where thou dwellest, even where Satans throne is; and thou hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fast my Name, and hast not denied my Faith, even in those daies wherein <hi>Antipas</hi> was my faithfull Martyr, who was slain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you where Satan dwelleth. <hi>On which saith Brightman,</hi> it is not obscure why it is called the throne of Satan. For the City where the heathen Emperors had their seat, who professedly warred against the Lamb, is called the throne of the Dragon, ch. 13. 2. so of the daughters and lower Cities those which come nearer to the mind of this Prince, because they yield a Palace more prepared for the Divel, are notified by the same name. <hi>And</hi> Revel. 12. 3. <hi>where it is said,</hi> Behold a great red Dragon having seven heads &amp; ten horns, &amp; seven Crowns upon his head, <hi>on its saith</hi> Mede, A wonder or representation of the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then worshiping the Dragon; <hi>the large</hi> Annotations on the Bible.</q>

By which and many other passages in holy Scripture it may appear, that the heathen Emperors had that power, whereby they persecuted the Church of Christ from Satan, and were as great Idolaters as those under the Papacy, and were as serviceable to the Divel, and yet are granted to be the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> and though the <hi>Powers of the great Image even the Iron legs,</hi> yet <hi>were not to be resisted,</hi> but the saints, even <hi>every soul,</hi> the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves not excepted, were to be subject to them under pain of damnation, Whence it follows, that there is no warrant for English pretended, or real Saints to smite the present Powers, to oppose, resist, overthrow the present Laws, Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, though it were yielded (which is not) that they were part of the fourth Monarchy, kept not their pure civil and unmixed State, were oppressors, shed the blood of the Saints, and what ever else the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> do object against them. Doubtless how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> have aggravated the cruelties of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 8th of <hi>England,</hi> and perhaps others may represent in the most odious manner the government of other Princes, yet they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not <hi>Nero, Domitian</hi> and other of the Roman Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in cruelty to the Christian believers, nor in uncleanness, and unrighteousness, and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> and our Lord Christ himself command subjection even to such.

It is supposed, <hi>when the power of Rome was adulterated from its pure civil State, and becomes a mixt Antichristian State, the Beast and a Whore,</hi> (which they conceive of the present civil powers of the Nations even the Protestant, and particularly those of <hi>England) then it is said of that beastly Antichristian power, that the Dragon or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan gave him his Power, &amp; his Seat and great Authority, and what then is this save the Ordinance of Hell?</hi> To examine this it is to be observed, 1. <hi>That they suppose it was the civil power of</hi> Rome <hi>which is meant,</hi> Revel. 13. 1. 2. <hi>by the beast, and that it is meant of the civil powers, since they became in name Christian.</hi> Which I will not gainsay, because of the words of the Angel <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the beast,</hi> though there are, or have been, that understand by it Heathen Emperors, afore they embraced Christianity, or an Emperor not yet extant, that I may omit other conjectures: and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55931:22"/>
therefore this is not to be taken as so certain, that on it should be grounded so strange a work as the smiting of all the civil powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> which is deduced from it. 2. It is supposed, <hi>that then the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers were adulterated from their pure civil and unmixed estate.</hi> By <hi>pure civil and unmixed estate</hi> they must mean (if I be not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) that afore that time the Roman Emperors did not meddle with the matters of Religion or of the Church: (which is most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously false, for they took the title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> ruled in the business of the worship of their Gods, did forbid Christian worship, and persecuted Christians to the death) And <hi>that they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> which is also false. For the Emperors Christian did reject that title, and demolished the temples of Idols, promoted the Christian worship, contended with the Bishops that did set up Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Churches, and if by the mixture be meant their assuming Ecclesiastical power, I suppose these Objectors will not charge them with this, it being to their great vexation, that the Bishops, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> claimed, and usurped authority over Emperors and Kings (as he doth at this day) to excommunicate them, &amp; if they reconciled not themselves to them to depose them, and many of the Emperors and Kings did contend against this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation in many sore Wars. If by <hi>mixture of State</hi> be meant the assisting of the Popes to destroy the opposers of the Papacy, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it true, that there were too many that did so. But in this there was no mixture of civil &amp; Ecclesiastical power, but rather a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Ecclesiastical keeping to themselves the judgment of Heresies, and putting upon the secular power the execution of their sentence, whereby they did debase the civil power in making it subservient to them, but made no mixture of State. Which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that some of the civil powers, that kept their civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as before, yet did oppose this usurpation in Popes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in making them their Executioners to destroy those who were judged Hereticks by them, and therefore this act of theirs was the evil of those persons that did it, but not of the civil Government it self. 3. It is supposed that <q>then the civil powers were the beast and a whore.</q> Which no doubt alludes to that which we read <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters, <hi>and v.</hi> 3. 7. the whore is resembled by a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, <hi>and v.</hi> 18. <hi>it is said,</hi> and the woman which thou sawest, is that great City, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth.</q> Which few do deny to be meant of <hi>Rome,</hi> some of the learned Papists themselves granting it to be meant of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55931:23"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> though they would have it believed, that <hi>Rome</hi> is so called <hi>the Whore</hi> while it was heathen, not since it became Christian. Others there are, chiefly Those of the Protestant Churches, who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by <hi>the Whore</hi> is meant <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> as conceiving the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ofher and her practises, cannot be applied to <hi>Rome</hi> as it was Paganish, or Ethnick. Whether this, or the other, or any other opinion be right, it is not needful now to discuss: It is sufficient, that the Civil Powers of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether Ethnick, or Christian, or in a future estate cannot well be termed <hi>the Beast and a Whore</hi> too, sith the text makes them distinct, or, if they may, yet sure the Civil Powers are not the Whore, sith it is said. v. 2. <q>The Kings of the earth have committed fornication with the Whore, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication;</q> therefore, <hi>the Kings of the earth, and inhabiters of the earth,</hi> must not be confounded, with <hi>the Whore.</hi> And v. 16. It is said, <q>And the ten Horns (who are ten Kings, which had received no Kingdom then.</q> v. 12. And therefore not while <hi>Rome</hi> was Ethnick, but after it's being Christian) <q>Which thou sawest upon the Beast, these shall hate the Whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire:</q> Therefore <hi>the Kings</hi> (which are the Civil Powers) are not the same with <hi>the Whore,</hi> but, though at first beguiled by her shall at last hate, and consume her, when they shall be undeceived.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is supposed, <q>that then the Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> when adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from its pure Civil Estate became a mixt Antichristian state, or <hi>a beastly Antichristian Power.</hi>
                  </q> What is meant by <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian state,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian Power</hi> is not easy to resolve. It is true the Apostle <hi>John</hi> makes mention of <hi>many Antichrists that should come in the last time,</hi> among which his words intimate, that there should be a special <hi>Antichrist, that they had heard should come,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18. And v. 22. He saith, <hi>He is Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son,</hi> And ch. 4. v. 3. He saith, <q>And every Spirit, that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: And this is that Spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even already is it in the world.</q> And in his <hi>second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> v. 7. <q>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.

true Doctrine concerning the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh-Nevertheless many of the ancients, in after ages, did often give hints of the expectation of Christians, commonly entertained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from St. <hi>Johns</hi> words, or some other tradition, that there would arise some more remarkable <hi>Antichrist,</hi> who should, whether by Power, or deceit, corrupt, or infest the Church of Christ, beyond what was done in his daies. And this hath been imagined by some of them, should be a <hi>Roman,</hi> the same with <hi>the man of sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>That wicked,</hi> or <hi>lawless one,</hi> v. 8. <hi>the Beast, Revel.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>And the Whore of Babylon, Revel.</hi> 17. 5. which in many ages the great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Courts, caused to be applied ever and anon, by some or other of the best and learnedst of their times, to the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Papacy.</hi> And since the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> it hath been almost generally received by Protestant Writers of all sorts, that the <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Papacy,</hi> especially since <hi>Pope Boniface the third,</hi> usurped the Title of <hi>Oecumenical Bishop,</hi> as proper to his See, and <hi>Gregory the seventh,</hi> the Power of deposing Emperors, and <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the eight,</hi> the welding of both swords, Civil and Ecclesiastical, are <hi>the Antichrist, Man of sin, Beast, and Whore of Babylon</hi> foretold, that he should come, by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>John.</hi> And not a few very learned, and sober godly men, both of Bishops and Presbyters in <hi>England, Ireland, France,</hi> and other Nations have asserted it by Preaching and writing; and have made it one of their chief pleas, for their refusing communion with, and enmity against the late Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Papal Church, although some of late have thought otherwise, and have endeavoured to apply those passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to some other, whether rightly, or not, I do not now determin. Whence it hath come to pass, that as the Papists, who still adhere to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Christs Vicar,</hi> and St. <hi>Peters Successor,</hi> swallow down all that comes from <hi>Rome,</hi> be it never so vain and erroneous: so on the other side those, who have been induced by the arguments inforced from the places of holy scripture alledged to conceive, that the Popes, or Papacy, or <hi>Roman</hi> Synagogue have been, and are <hi>the Antichrist, Man of sin, Babylon, the Whore</hi> therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have been apt to abhor any thing, sometimes that which is otherwise right, which they conceive to come from <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Pope, being terrified with the threatnings, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 9. 10, 11. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those, <q>who worship the Beast, and his Image, and recieve his mark in their forehead, or in their hand, <hi>and warned</hi> by the voice from Heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4.

her plagues.</q> Which having been found by experience, to be a very taking way, especially with the vulgar, and common sort of Schollars, who are little versed in antiquity, and know not the true state of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in former ages, nor by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the corruptions thereof came to that height they are now attained to, it is now a very common course with them, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to render their opposites, their Doctrine, or practise odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so to uphold their faction, to fasten on them, by clamour or calumnies, or any other way they can, the name of <hi>Antichristian, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, the mark of the Beast,</hi> and to perswade men, that what they dislike, is from <hi>Rome,</hi> as being sufficient without any other proof to make them abominable, and to be destroyed. Thus in our daies with us some have cried down prelacy, their Liturgy, Ceremonies, Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, National Church, it's Government, Ministry, Titles, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever belongs thereto as <hi>Antichristian;</hi> others have done the like to the Presbyterial, Classical, Parochial Churches, their Ministery, Directory, Government, Maintenence: others have done the same to the Congregational, and in General, Seekers and Quakers, have in a Clamorous way like Scolds bespattered all that's opposit to them, with this reproach of Antichristian, and at last these <hi>Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> men have furiously battered Civil powers, &amp; all that belongs to them, with the engine of this odious brand of <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish,</hi> whereby much irreconcileable hatred, enmity and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is raised among Christians, to the great dammage of Christian Protestant Churches, and states, and, without the great power and goodness of God, making way for some accommodation of these differences, likely so to weaken and wast us by intestine broiles, that we shall at last become a prey to the common adversary. For my part it was still opposed by me long since when <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> wrote, that I <hi>had proved Infant-Baptism Antichristian,</hi> I made him alter it, and when a meeting was for union between dissenters, I urged th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s as one thing necessary, that the term <hi>Antichristian</hi> should be forborn, and when <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> entituled his book against my <hi>serious consideration of the Oath of the Kings Supremacy, Antichristianism re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi> in my <hi>Epistle to the Reader</hi> before my <hi>Supplement</hi> I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed the falsehood of his calumny, but also endeavoured briefly to shew the evil of that course of defaming opposites, and their tenents by that title. I deny not but that there is sufficient cause given to Protestant Divines to charge the present Romanists with Antichristianism in the arrogant title given to the Pope of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Bishop, in the assertion of his supremacy over all Churches,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55931:24"/>
his infallibility, in their worship of Saints, Angels, Images, in their doctrines of invocation of Saints, humane merits and satisfactions for sin: nor shall I deny but that there may be found some pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, or doctrines among others, which may in a qualified sense be termed Antichristian. But to make the Protestant Churches or their Government Antichristian in State, and to be separated from, and to be destroyed, when they hold the Faith of Christ aright, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some corruptions in points of Doctrine, or Worship, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which overthrow not the foundation of Christian Religion, is intollerable, much more to make civil powers, who reject the Roman Popes supremacy, and their doctrine and idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be Antichristian, from <hi>Rome, Babylon,</hi> from an imagined mixture, that is not, or perhaps justifiable, shews either phrensie, or a meer proud arrogant factious and quarrelsome humor in them, not to be born, the title of Antichrist being (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by St. <hi>Johns</hi> words) to be applyed to seducing Teachers, not to civil powers though persecutors, as the Roman Emperors then were, yet by St. <hi>Paul</hi> termed <hi>the Ordinance of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is supposed, <q>That then, when the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated from its pure Civil state, became a mixt Antichristian state, the Beast &amp; a Whore, a Beastly Antichristian Power, that the Dragon, or Satan, gave him his Power, and his Seat and great Authority. It is true that it is said, that St. <hi>John</hi> saw a Beast arise out of the Sea, having seven Heads and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that the Beast which he saw was like unto a <hi>Leopard,</hi> and his feet were as the feet of a Bear, &amp; his mouth as the mouth of a Lion: And the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat and great Authority.</q> Which description being like that, whereby the Babylonian <hi>Persian,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchies are characterized, gives occasion to judge, that the Beast mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 1. 2. was to be some future Civil Empire like to them, and <hi>the having se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns,</hi> because of the descriptions, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 23, 24, 25. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 3. 9. 12. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes, that it was to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire divided into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; nor is it to be denied, that Satan <hi>gave to this Beast his Power,</hi> that is his forces, <hi>and his Seat,</hi> that is, <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Dominions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, <hi>&amp; great Authority,</hi> that is, Power to command, whereby the Idolatry termed <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> which the Christian Emperors had cast down, was revived and the persecution that for a time ceased, was renewed: But that this <q>Power and Seat, and great Authority
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55931:25"/>
was not given before by the Dragon to the Civil Powers of old <hi>Rome</hi> tho a bloody persecuter, and devourer of the creation, and Gods Heritage;</q> is to be denied. For by comparing, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 1, 2. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3, 4. 7. It may be rather gathered, that Satan had given the same Power, Seat, and great Authority to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors before, as he did to the Kings after, though it were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in another manner, and upon other pretences. <hi>The Power and Seat, and Authority given by the Dragon,</hi> is not to be meant of Civil Power to make Laws, and to execute them for the well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Common-wealths, and Civil states, but the Power, Force, or Authority, which was usurped by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he set up a golden Image to be worshipped, and cast the three <hi>Jews</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fiery furnance, and this may be gathered from, v. 4, 5. <q>And they worshipped the Dragon, which gave Power unto the Beast; and they worshipped the Beast, saying, who is like unto the Beast? Who is able to make Warr with him? And there was given unto him a mouth, speaking great things and Blasphemies, and Power was given unto him, to continue, or to make War forty and two months.</q> Whereby may be perceived, that the Power and Authority given by Satan, was to speak great things, and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to make War with the Saints. And again of the two Horned Beast, v. 12. It is said, <q>
                     <hi>that he exerciseth all the Power</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

Which was in the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Emperors from Satan, who is said <hi>to cast the Christians into Prison, Revel.</hi> 2. 10. by stirring up the Pagan Emperors and their subordinate Rulers to do it, and yet their Civil Power, as is confessed, was the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is supposed, <q>that then when the Powers of the great Image, or old <hi>Rome,</hi> became a mixt Antichristian estate, and not before, they became the Ordinance of Hell, to which there is no Subjection due.</q> But they do not tell us when this was, nor can tell. And is it not then blind fury, that hurries men to such frantick determinations as to date the relaxation of so plain a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as that <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. is, from such a time, as they know not when it begins, and to infer thence a warrant for some supposing

themselves Saints upon no better evidence, than their conceit of <q>Gods Revelation of this by his Spirit from his word, <hi>to attempt</hi> the smiting of all the Powers of the great Image Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical; whose derivation is from <hi>Rome</hi> (others not excepted nor freed) the Kingdoms of the Romish Iron Legs, or the Roman Kingdom divided into the Eastern and Western Monarchies (wherein the whole Dominion, Power and Monarchy of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Family, or that of the Turkes is comprehended) and the Beasts, ten Horns or Antichrists Civil Powers (equivalent to the ten Toes) and also the little Horn, together with all powers whatsoever, that shall be found opposers of the Lords Kingdom, whether they be of the golden Babylonish, Silver Persian, Brasen Grecian, or Iron Roman, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and ch. 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.

               <p n="7">7. It is supposed, <q>that the Civil Powers now, even in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are a mixt Antichristian state, and that their Power is from the Dragon,</q> since this mixture, though not before. But with what colour can they make those powers <hi>Antichristian,</hi> who do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the faith of Christ? To have their Power from <hi>Rome,</hi> who have denied obedience to the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi> To be a mixt <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> state, who cause their subjects to abjure the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy? To have their power from the Dragon, who do by their Lawes &amp; the Execution of them, pull down the worship of Idols, and punish with death Diabolical Arts? Quarrels perhaps are against the Kings Supremacy, over Ecclesiastical persons, and in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal causes, as if it made a mixt Antichristian state, so as that what is denied to the Pope, is given to the King: But this objection was so fully answered by Dr. <hi>John Rainold,</hi> in his <hi>conference with</hi> Hart <hi>the Jesuite in the Tower,</hi> ch. 10. that <hi>Hart</hi> himself was satisfied, that it was not so. Perhaps some others imagin, that in the making of Bishops there is an adulterating of the pure Civil power, and an Antichristian mixture of Civil and Ecclesiastical power; but this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is but a mistake, that which is meerly Ecclesiastical, therein being left to Ecclesiastiques to do. Yet, were it granted there were some mixture of Civil and Ecclesiastical power, that this should make
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55931:26"/>
the Civil powers Antichristian, is without all reason affirmed. Were the Fathers of the Family, or the first-born sons, both Rulers Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical, and Priests to offer sacrifice, Melchizedec, a King and a Priest, David a King and a Prophet, therefore Antichristian? will they count all preachers who are masters, and parents, and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands by reason of this conjunction of these different functions in their persons therefore Antichrian? Are not, or have not there been many of them, who perhaps have been of the fraternity of the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> themselves, who have had commands in the Army, and yet have been Preachers, yea taken upon them to be Elders in the Churches, and to have had ordination by laying on of hands, who yet have not been judged by reason of this mixture Antichristian? Are not then these men very partial, who condemn that in one, which they do not in another, conniving at, if not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in such as favour their party, which they do count, &amp; inveigh against, as a most heinous crime, deserving extermination in them that side not with them? Much more abominable is it, that they should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that power, by which peace is kept, justice is done, humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is preserved, to the Dragon, and not see it to be from the Devil, that they stir up hatred in the world, and practise murthering of innocent men, yea of those who are by God made Rulers over them, whom they should obey, assist, and defend.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is supposed, <q>that the mixture of Civil powers by them imagined makes them, who otherwise had been the Ordinance of God, to be the Ordinance of Hell, and their power from the Dragon, though promoting Idolatry and persecuting Christianity by the Roman Ethnick Emperors, did not make void their being the Ordinance of God, nor the duty of Christians Subjection to them.</q> As if the shedding of the blood of the Saints, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Idols were not more from Satan, and more inconsistent with Civil powers than an usurpation of an Ecclesiastick office, or <hi>Uzziahs</hi> presumption to burn incense: God would not have <hi>David</hi> build him a Temple, because he had shed blood, not because he was, as it is likely, Author of fetching the Ark to him in a Cart; &amp; he and all <hi>Israel</hi> attended the carrying of it, <hi>playing before the Lord on all manner of instruments.</hi> Sure this Doctrine smells rank of <hi>Pharisaism to break the Commandments of God for mens traditions,</hi> to disanul the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Civil Parents, because of some supposed inordinate mixture. Yea is not this the very venom of Antichristian Papal <hi>listing up of themselves above all that is called God,</hi> not only to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and depose Emperors for simony (as the Popes termed it)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55931:26"/>
because they gave Bishops investiture into their Bishopricks, or for Heresy, or favouring hereticks in not destroying them, but also to proclaim War against them, and attempt to kill them by reason of mixture, or not furthering, or opposing their <hi>Fifth-Monarchy?</hi> Lastly, these men, by allowing only this smiting work on the civil powers, since their imagined mixture, do evacuate all the rest of their arguments for justifying it, whether from the <hi>Stones smiting Dan.</hi> 2. or <hi>taking the Kingdom, Dan.</hi> 7. or such other, whether just or unjust, accusations, or exclamations against civil powers which they make the reason of their smiting without this, and though the scriptures, make not at all this to be any of the evils in them, or the reasons of Gods, or mans hostility against them. To conclude them, though much more might be said against this hellish Doctrine of smiting civil powers, it is sufficiently demonstrated, that the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and inferences of <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men,</hi> against the first argument are false and venemous, and the conclusion stands good, their smiting is damnable and Antichristan.</p>

               <p>A Second argument against the smiting of civil powers, I draw from those words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <q>I exhort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for allmen: For Kings, &amp; for all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or <hi>excellency,</hi> or <hi>eminent place,</hi> or <hi>sovereign dignity;</hi> that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness &amp; honesty. For this is good &amp; acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.</q> 
                  <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> it is likely, hath reference to what he had said before. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 18. <q>Because of the Prophecies that went before of thee, that by them thou mightest war a good warfare, I charge thee, and exhort thee, and first of all I exhort thee;</q> being to add other exhortations, or, as we read it, <hi>that first of all,</hi> that is, as the chief or prime thing of all other; <q>supplications against evils, prayers for good things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions for others, thanksgivings be made for all men;</q> all sorts of men, even <hi>for Kings,</hi> or Emperors (who were then persecutors of Christians and promoters of Idol service) <q>and all their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governours, to the intent we may lead a quiet and peacable life
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55931:27"/>
free from Invasions, Robberies, and Injuries in <hi>all godliness, and honesty, gravity,</hi> or <hi>seemliness: For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</hi>
                  </q> Whence may be inferred, 1. That inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions are to be made for the worst of Kings, even the persecuting Emperors of the Fourth <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and for all that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or dignity. 2. That there should be thanksgivings for them. 3. That this is good and acceptable in the sight of God or Saviour. 4. That this is a benefit to Christians, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable life by means of Kings and persons in authority. 5. That to this Christian teachers are to exhort. 6. That first of all they should do this, or exhort them to do this first of all, or as chiefest of all. Whence I argue,</p>
               <p>That work, and the inciting to it, must needs be damnable and Antichristian, which is directly contrary to that, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts in the first place, or chiefly to be done; this I should think none should deny, who acknowledgeth St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of Christ, and to have known and delivered in this Epistle the mind of Christ: But the work of smiting civil powers, and the Doctrine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> inciting thereto by accursing them, stirring up hatred against them, exposing them to disobedience, contempt, opposition of such as are under them, is directly contrary to that, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts in the first place, or chiefly to be done. Which no man that is well in his wits can deny, cursing, stirring up hatred against civil powers, exposing them to disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, contempt, opposition of such as are under them, being as directly contrary to praying, and giving thanks for them, as black to white, bitter to sweet, and raising War, and taking up Arms, and smiting them being diametrally opposite to leading a quiet and peaceable life under them, or by their means, and counting this to tend to the promoting of Christs Kingdom, contrary to the Apostle who makes it a hinderance of godliness and honesty, and judging that to be the generation work of illuminated, and the most sincere Saints, which is contrary to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith is good, and to expect, that God should reward, and highly regard men for doing that smiting work, is contrary to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour. Now that Doctrine which is thus contrary to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> must needs be damnable and Antihristian, and therefore the conclusion followes, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> smiting work of civil powers, is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Antichristian. I know no exception against this, but what was against the former argument, and is refelled, and therefore I pass on to a third argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55931:27"/>
The third argument I shall urge against the Doctrine of smiting eivil powers is from the examples of Christ, his Apostles, the holy Martyrs and Saints of the first and best ages of the Christian Church, which should be as a Rule to the succeeding. Concerning the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Lord Christ it is manifest, that our Lord Christ was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Parents, his Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> and his reputed Father <hi>Joseph, Luke</hi> 2. 51. that though he pleaded immunity from paying the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drachms, or shekles translated <hi>tribute money, Matth.</hi> 17. 25. yet he paid it, <hi>that he might not offend</hi> the Collectors, or Rulers who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them, who, whether they were the Officers of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or of the High Priest; and the mony paid for the use of the Temple, as <hi>Cameron</hi> in his <hi>Prelection</hi> on that scripture argues; yet it shewes he was voluntarily, though not necessitated, resolved to have regard to Rulers of every sort, that he might therein be an example to us of Subjection. Which is more fully proved by his answer to the High Priest adjuring him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 63. by his <hi>confession before Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. mentioned as imitable by <hi>Timothy</hi> v. 12. And most of all by his sufferings even unto death, in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Epistle</hi> 2. 21. Tells us, that <hi>Christ also suffered fo us, leaving us an example,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a copy</hi> or <hi>written description,</hi> or <hi>impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that ye should follow his steps,</hi> and this is applied as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why they <hi>should submit themselves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake;</hi> not meerly out of fear of punishment, but in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christs command, or conformity to his pattern, and these humane Ordinances are named to be <q>Kings, Governours sent by them, Masters not only good and Gentle, but also froward.</q> Whereby it is plain, that our Lord Christ by his Subjection, both active and passive, imposeth on all Saints Subjection to all sorts of Rulers, whether Houshold, or Ecclesiastical, or civil in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as a necessary duty, and therefore the Doctrine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> teaching it as an incumbent duty, on the most illuminated (as they fancy it) Saints to disclaim not only Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Rulers, but also civil powers in order to their smiting work, and also to smite them is damnable and Antichristian. Nor can here the pretences of their being of the fourth Monarchy, from <hi>Rome,</hi> Oppressors, Idolaters, Antichristian, salve the matter, fith those Priests of the Jewes, and Roman Governours, to whom Christ yeiled Subjection, were as bad, and every way as obnoxious to their criminations of the present Governours, as any now be. Assuredly the present Governours in these Nations, cannot be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with such things as <hi>Pilate, Caiaphas,</hi> and the rest of those Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55931:28"/>
to whom Christ was subject, were chargable wth without extream impudence. This argument is further confirmed from the examples of all the holy Apostles, Martyrs, and Confessors in the primative times of Christianity. Instances might be given in <hi>James, Peter, Paul,</hi> who doubtless could as easily have killed their persecutors as <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> or strucken them blind, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Elymas the Sorcerer,</hi> yet submitted themselves to imprisonment, pleaded their cause before Roman Rulers, appealed to <hi>Caesar,</hi> suffered even to death. In the times following the Christians served under the persecuting Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in their Wars, and though they were in number many, disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedover their Empire, and had Arms in their hands, whereby they might in appearance have been able to have defended themselves against the violence of their persecutors, yet they chose to suffer under the tyrannous Emperors, that then were, rather than to rise up against them to revenge themselves, because their Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession did forbid them, as <hi>Tertullian, Apolog.</hi> c. 37. <hi>ad scapulam.</hi> c. 2. <hi>Cyprian ad Demetr.</hi> and others plead for them.</p>
               <p>Out of these and other examples, which might be produced, we may argue thus. That Doctrine which teacheth men to do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the examples and profession of our Lord Christ Jesus, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Martyrs, Confessors, Saints in the first and best ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, is damnable and Antichristian. But such is the Doctrine of the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> concerning their smiting of civil powers, as is manifest by comparing them, therefore it is damnable and Antichristian.</p>

               <p>A Fourth argument I deduce from those places of holy scripture which censure, condemn and denounce woe unto those practises, which the Doctrine of the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> incites men to, and they magnify as the fruits of Gods Spirit. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter</hi> 2 <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. <q>The Lord knowes how to deliver the Godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment, to be punished. But chiefly them that walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and dispise Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Dominion, presumptuous are they, self-willed: they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities: whereas Angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not a railing accusation against them before the Lord. Which is seconded by St. <hi>Jude</hi> v. 8, 9, 10.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55931:28"/>
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and speak evil of dignities. Yet <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, when contending with the Devil, he disputed about the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee. But these speak evil of the things they know not.</q> In which passages those holy Apostles rank, <hi>the despisers of Dominion, those that speak evil of dignities,</hi> not among the Saints, but amongst the most accursed reprobates (though those Dominions and dignities were as bad as might be, in respect of their personal qualities and actions) yea the Arch-Angels example is brought in as not <hi>daring to bring against the Devil himself, when there was a contention about</hi> Moses <hi>his body, a railing accusation;</hi> but refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to the <hi>Lord to rebuke him,</hi> teaching thereby, that such terms, as contain threatning, contempt, reproach of Governors, and dignities, are altogether unsuteable to Saints, and such as they should not dare to utter, though they contended with the Devil himself, much less with men, that are in Power and Authority, much less to smite them, and directing how to deal with them, when they be injurious, to wit, to defer their cause to God for his suppression of them, and threatning wo to the practisers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Dominion, and speaking evil of dignities. All which are contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> who revile, dispise, threaten them, commend the smiting of them, as the generation work, promise rewards to them that do it. Whence I infer that Doctrine which animates men to such practises, as are damned by the holy Apostles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> is damnable and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</hi> But such is the Doctrine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their vilifying and smiting civil powers: therefore it is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and <hi>Antichristian.</hi>

The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> never taught the Jewes to vilify <hi>Manasseh</hi> his Kingdom, or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, notwithstanding his reprehension of his wickedness, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his calamity: And in like manner, though preachers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that Office, may in a fit way shew Princes their sins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their danger: Yet in no sort are they to vilify their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or contemn their persons. Nor may men pretend the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Prophets boldness, unless they can shew their commission, and are endowed with their Spirit and power: Nor may men, who are but private persons, take upon them to do as Christ did when he drove the buyers and sellers out of the Temple.</p>
               <p>Which will be more fully proved by a fifth argument taken from some resolutions, or determinations of our Lord Christ, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn such attempts &amp; practises, as the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> Doctrine animates to, upon pretence of zeal for Christ and his Kingdom. <hi>Luke,</hi> 9. 54, 55, 56. <q>When Christ was to go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the Samaritans to make ready for him. And they did not receive him, because his face was asthough he would go to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and when his Desciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> saw this, they said, Lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from Heaven, and consume them, even as <hi>Elias</hi> did? But he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and rebuked them and said, ye know not what manner of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55931:29"/>
Spirit ye are of. For the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</q> In which resolution our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the motion of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to have fire come down from Heaven, to destroy the Samaritans, for their not entertaining of Christ, in imitation of <hi>Elias,</hi> out of zeal for Christ; because it was not out of the same Spirit that <hi>Elijah</hi> had, nor agreeable to the end of Christs coming, and his Gospel, which were <hi>not to destroy mens lives, but save them.</hi> Now then the Doctine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> which urgeth their smiting work, which tends to the destroying of mens lives, and not the saving of them, out of a zeal, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for Christ and his Kingdom, though there be no other then a private, or rather an haughty factious Spirit in them, is contrary to Christs resolution, and therefore indeed damnable and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian. Nor hath it indeed in Christ, or his Apostles Doctrine, or example any warrant; but is an imitation of that pernicious use of the later Jewes, which was taken up in a perverse imitation of <hi>Phinehas</hi> his act <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 40. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 10. and some others, out of zeal for their Law, without Authority, to destroy those things and persons, which they judged contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as in the stoning of <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. St. <hi>Paul Acts,</hi> 14. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which they were carried furiously, and violently without any legal judicial proceeding, hearing and sentence by Authorized Judges; which caused so many seditions, and such outrages, as at last provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Romans</hi> to make a most horrid destruction of that people, and ruin of that state. To which the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> opinon, and practise hath been too like, and, if not stayed, would bring the like effect on Church and State with us. The other determination is that of our Saviour in the case of <hi>Peters</hi> drawing his sword to rescue Christ in the garden from the Soldiers, which came to take him, and <hi>striking a servant of the High Priests and smiting off his ear,</hi> which our Saviour disallowed, bidding him <hi>to put up his sword again into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword, Matth.</hi> 26. 52. where our Lord, who had bid them buy swords, <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 36. a little before, yet forbids the drawing of it, and smiting off the ear of a servant of the High Priest, though it were out of zeal for him, it being against an Officer by a person without Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the evil consequence, which would follow on such usage of it. Now the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> smiting civil powers out of pretended zeal for Christs Kingdom without any authority in a furious heart of spirit is much more apparently contrary to Christs resolution in <hi>Peters</hi> case, and therefore is censured justly to be damnable and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A Sixth argument against the Doctrine of smiting civil powers, in order to the setting up of the Fifth-Monarchy, is taken from those texts of scripture, which forbid resisting of evil and avenging our selves. Our Lord Christ. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 38, 39. reciting out of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> words interpreted, as allowing retaliation of wrongs with the like, as those who threaten to others, that they will give them as good as they bring, he on the contrary tels his Disciples, <q>But I say unto you, resist not evil: But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</q> Which is not to be understood simply and absolutely, as if that <hi>turning the cheek</hi> were to be done alwayes in the act it self: But in a comparative sense, rather than make a brawl or fight, take further injury signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the proverbial phrase of <hi>turning the check:</hi> now if Christians be forbidden to fight, when they are injured, to recompense evil for evil, then much more are they forbidden, being private persons, to whom the sword is not commited, of their own accord to begin a War even with superiors, and to proclaim it in order to procuring of good, as the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> Doctrine moves Saints to. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 17. <q>Recompense to no man evil for evil v. 19. Dearly beloved avenge not your selves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it written, vengeance is mine, I will repay it saith the Lord, v. 21. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 3. 9. Not rendering evil for evil, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for railing: But contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing: When <hi>David</hi> had cut off <hi>Sauls</hi> skirt, his heart smote him, and he said unto his men, the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my Master the Lords annointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5, 6. The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee, but mine hand shall not be upon thee. <hi>As saith the Proverb of the</hi> Ancients, Wickedness proceeedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. v. 12. 13. And <hi>David</hi> said to <hi>Abigail,</hi> blessed be the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> which sent thee this day to meet me, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55931:30"/>
blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging my self with mine own hand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, 33.</q> Which shew, that herein both in the old and new Testament holy persons agree, that a King is not to be smitten though in hostility without cause, by any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, though he were anointed to be King after him, that revenge of injury, oppression or persecution, though it extended to the slaying the Lords Priests, &amp; to an endeavour to slay the annointed Captain of the Lords Host, is not to be attempted by a private person or subject, but to be referred to the Lord. Therefore the Doctrine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> urging subjects and private persons to smite their superior civil powers, and to avenge the supposed injuries and persecutions of Saints by their own hands, is contrary to Christ's, his Apostles, and <hi>Davids</hi> determinations in the holy Scriptures, and consequently damnable and Antichristian.</p>
               <p>That which I find alledged for their practise, is in these words, <q>The Banner of truth displayed, p. 59. All the blood of Gods people is found in <hi>Babylon:</hi> For they <hi>(i. e.</hi> her civil powers <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 6, 6.) have shed the blood of the Saints and Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. ch. 18. 24. and 19. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 14. now therefore God by way of recompence and retalliation, hath ordained, that the Saints shall be his instruments by which he will execute his vengeance upon the powers of the world, who are all of them murtherers: accordingly God commands his people (and 'tis their duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey) to reward <hi>Babylon</hi> double as she rewarded them; yea, and double unto her all those plagues, deaths and stripes, that she hath inflicted on you, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. and they shall give her blood to drink, and she shall be burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord that judgeth her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein many things are taken as granted which are false, and the whole (if it were granted) would be insufficient to acquit them from guilt of opposing Christs precepts in that way of recompence and retaliation, which they incite to. 1. <hi>That all the powers of the world are murtherers.</hi> Which proposition contains such a crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as God only is fit to charge them with, if it were true, sith he only knows all the powers of the world, and is privy to all their thoughts, designs and actions. 2. That <hi>the civil powers of the world are</hi> Babylon, <hi>or her civil powers.</hi> Now <hi>Babylon</hi> is termed <hi>the great, which shall become the habitation of Divels, Rev.</hi> 18. 2. and, I think, it is undoubted with all sorts of Writers and intelligent persons, that <hi>Babylon the great</hi> there meant is the same with <hi>the woman, Rev.</hi> 17. 4.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55931:31"/>
termed v. 1. <q>The great whore, upon whose forehead was a name, written, Mystery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the mother of Hariots, and abominations of the earth v. 5. <hi>which is interpreted</hi> v. 18. And the woman which thou sawest, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the earth.</q> Which commonly those who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Histories of the times, in which St. <hi>John</hi> received his Revelation, even Papists themselves, do take to be <hi>Rome,</hi> known to be the only City <hi>which sate on seven mountains</hi> as v. 9. is expressed and <hi>reigned then over the Kings of the earth.</hi> But how all the <hi>powers of the world</hi> now in being, or <hi>the Nations of Europe,</hi> even <hi>the Protestant</hi> should be <hi>Babylon</hi> or her <hi>civil powers,</hi> or, as elsewhere they say, <hi>the streets of that great City, and Rome-Babylon,</hi> is unintelligible to me. <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and that which is called the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the territories in <hi>Italy</hi> now subject to the Pope may be termed <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Civil powers therein may be termed <hi>her Civil powers,</hi> and perhaps all the territories subject to the Pope in Ecclefiastical affairs may be meant by <hi>the streets of the great</hi> City mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 8. because they yield subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope in spirituals. But how the States which do reject the Pope's power in Temporals, as the King of <hi>France,</hi> or the Duke and Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> who stood out against Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, when he interdicted them, because they would not repeal their Laws, or release their prisoners though Ecclesiasticks, should be termed the civil powers of <hi>Rome-Babylon</hi> is not easie to be understood; much less, how the Kings of <hi>England, Denmark, Sweden</hi> and such other Protestant States, Nations and Princes as have rejected the Popes jurisdiction and authority, both in civil, and Church matters, and impose oaths of disclaiming the Popes supremacy in Spirituals, and their authority in Temporals through their Dominions on their Subjects, should be nevertheless the <hi>civil powers of Babylon,</hi> and their Countries <hi>the streets of the great City Rome-Babylon,</hi> is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable by me. If the Predecessors of these did subject themselves to the Pope in former ages, yet they are not therefore termed <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> but <hi>Kings of the earth who commit fornication with her, and give their power to her;</hi> but neither of these can be said of those Princes, though Successors to them, who have abandoned the Popes errors and corruptions in Religion, and his jurisdiction wholly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is suggested, that <q>all the blood of Gods people is found in <hi>Babylon:</hi> For they <hi>(i. e.</hi> her civil powers <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 6, 7.) have shed the blood of the Saints and Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>and</hi> 19. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 14.</q> And it is true that <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 14. it is said,

It is rather charged on <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by Christ, that <q>she killed the Prophets and stoned them that were sent unto her, that upon her might come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> unto the blood of <hi>Zacharias</hi> Son of <hi>Barachias,</hi> whom ye, <hi>saith Christ,</hi> slew between the Temple and the Altar, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 34, 35. 37.</q> It is said <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6. <q>And the third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel poured out his vial upon the Rivers and Fountains of waters and they became blood.

these especially <hi>Brightman, Mede,</hi> and some others, conceived the third vial to be poured out.

It is said, that <q>therefore God by way of recompence and retaliation, hath ordained, that the Saints shall be his instrument by which he will execute his vengeance upon the powers of teh world, who are all of them Murtherers: Accordingly God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his people (and tis their duty to obey) to reward <hi>Babylon</hi> double, as she rewarded them; yea, and double unto her with all those plagues, deaths and stripes, that she hath inflicted on you, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. And they shall give her blood to drink, and she shall be burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord that judgeth her.</q> To which I reply. 1. that all this runs upon a palpable mistake, that the powers of the world, or the civil powers, are the <hi>Babylon, which is to be rewarded double, Rev.</hi> 18. 6. whereas it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that the <hi>Babylon to be rewarded double,</hi> is that <hi>great mighty ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> v. 10. out of which <hi>Gods people are to come.</hi> v. 4. which is to be <hi>utterly burnt with fire;</hi> though the inhabitants are also included, <hi>whose sins reached up to Heaven.</hi> v. 5. <hi>Glorified her self.</hi> v. 7. yet the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil powers of the world cannot be meant there, sith it is said. v. 9. <q>And the Kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, standing a far off, for the fear of her torments. 2. It is another mistake as if God had ordained that the Saints, or Gods people, without any other circumscription should be his instrument, by which he will execute his vengeance upon <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </q> For though it be spoken to the people of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>To reward Babylon as she rewarded them, in the cup she hath filled, fill her double,</hi> yet it be said, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16. <q>And the ten Horns which thou sawest upon the Beast, these shall hate the Whore and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their Kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</q> Whence it appears, that it is so far from truth, that the civil powers of the world are <hi>Babylon,</hi> and are to be destroyed in order to <hi>Babylons</hi> downfall, that they are distinct from <hi>Babylon,</hi> so as <hi>to stand a far off and lament her</hi> some of them, and others are to be instruments <hi>of burning her with fire.</hi> And therefore although <hi>the people of God, which are to come out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>those who are with the Lambe, called faithful and chosen, Rev.</hi> 17. 14 may be with the Kings that burn her, and being escaped out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> may be instrumental to its destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being joyned with the Kings, yet it doth not appear, that God hath ordained the Saints, who are only private men, and no Kings,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55931:33"/>
shall do it by themselves, by their own power, but in conjunction with them or subordination to them, and therefore in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vengeance on <hi>Babylon,</hi> there will be execution by the civil powers of the world, not upon them, and Saints are bound in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this smiting work, to maintain civil powers, not to smite them, or separate from them. 3. Though the words, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. be in the Imperative mood, yet it doth not thence necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is <hi>Gods command to his people, which it is their duty to obey,</hi> or else they sin against God, <hi>to reward Babylon,</hi> but it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as a prediction of what should be, not as a command of what ought to be done by them as their duty, as the like expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 50. 2. 14, 15. 21. 26, 27, 28, 29. (which are imitated <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. 6. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Isai.</hi> 56. 9.) are to be expounded, or as a permission allowing a person to do it, as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>Whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake:</hi> which doth not injoyn them to eat whatsoever was set before them, so as that, if they did not eat, it would be their sin; for then they should be required to be gluttons; but is an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to them, allowing them liberty to eat as a thing not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but indifferent, which, unless further admonished, they might eat without scruple of conscience. 4. That it is not a command to the people, who did <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> nor their act <hi>to reward double to Babylon,</hi> and <hi>fill to her double,</hi> but a prediction of what shall be done by others, may be gathered in that <hi>the reward to them,</hi> is to be construed to have been the slaughter of them, and <hi>the cup, which Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> filled, was the cup of blood, which she <hi>was to drink of, Revel.</hi> 16. 6. now then those persons who were rewarded, to whom this cup was filled by <hi>Babylon,</hi> are such as had been put to death by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and therefore could not <hi>reward her double,</hi> or <hi>fill her double in the cup which she hath filled,</hi> unless they were raised from the dead, and consequently could not be the same individuals, who are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come out of <hi>Babylon, Revel.</hi> 18. 4. 5. Upon this consideration it is also probable, that <hi>the rewarding,</hi> and <hi>filling, Revel.</hi> 18. 6. is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the Martyrs killed, because God did it by reason of the cry of their blood, which is intimated by the words, v. 20. <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven, and ye holy Apostles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her,</hi> and other words, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 18. do intimate the same. Which, if true, is nothing to the smiting work of the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-Monarchians, by military power turning their Plow-shares into swords:</hi> but only intimates the efficacy of the blood of Martys to bring divine vengeance on <hi>Babylon.</hi> 6. But were it granted; that <hi>the people of God
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55931:33"/>
invited to come out of Babylon, Revel.</hi> 18. 4. were the same numerical persons, who are commanded to <hi>reward Babylon double, and to fill her double in the cup, which she hath filled,</hi> and they are to do this by smiting with the sword; yet this is nothing to the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> unless they should be in <hi>Babylon</hi> at that time, when Gods people should come out of her, and did so come out of her. And therefore there is no command, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. for them to smite till then, but they are to put up their sword into the sheath, and to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty under their Governors, else they will be guilty of resisting and self-revenging condemned by Christ and his Apostles, which was to be proved.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HEnce also a seventh argument is deduced, that the smiting work, to which the Doctrine of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> incites, is wilful murder, yea the most horrible murder that ever was, except his, who <hi>was a murderer from the beginning, John</hi> 8. 44. or theirs, <hi>who crucified the Lord of glory;</hi> For it incites to a professed smiting, and spoyling of all the civil powers on earth, even those to whom they are bound to be subject by all Lawes of Religion, nature, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and reason, and to act these things with all extremity, out of imagined zeal for Christ, which if it be not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is a fire of Hell, which will hardly be ever quenched, and in prosecution thereof to smite those who resist them, which must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be all those who adhere to civil powers, who will be doubtless the most conscientious Saints on earth, and the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which must needs be wilful Murder and Robbery, if they have no warrant to do it. But they have none; neither, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. nor any other scripture, or Revelation of God, that we or they do know, nor Lawes of nature, or men do in the least warrant, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, but all condemn it. And therefore if they should be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to act their design (which God forbid) there would be more destruction and wasting, than ever yet was made by men since the world began, and more truly they might be termed <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>whom the blood of the Saints is found,</hi> than any civil powers yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; now murder-makes persons the Children of the Divil, there being no sin more resembling him, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Whosoever hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

his brother is a murderer; and ye know</hi> (saith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epist. ch.</hi> 3. 15.) <hi>That no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him,</hi> therefore such are no Saints, but Antichristian, and the Doctrine moving to it is damnable and Antichristan.</p>
               <p>To which I shall add an eighth argument taken from the direful effects, to which the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> Doctrine of overturning and smiting civil powers and Lawes tends, which are all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which anarchy and confusion brings on the world, even to the destruction of the Church of Christ on earth, or rather according to the project they propound, humane society, if not the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind. For by taking away civil powers, safety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and all comforts of life are either taken away or much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. When the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> threatned calamity to the people of the Jewes, <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. He tels them, <q>the Lord, the Lord of hosts doth take away the mighty man, and the man of War, the Judge, and the Prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, the Captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the Counsellor, and the cunning Artificer, and the eloquent Orator, and I will give Children to be their Princes, and Babes shall rule over them, and the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</q> Whereby it may be perceived that God took it to be a curse next after the <hi>taking away the stay, and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water</hi> to take from the Jewes their Rulers, Teachers, Nobles, Scholars, and therefore there cannot be a greater calamity to a people, after the destruction of the fruits of the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by famine comes than to smite time their civil powers, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons, who have been the Protectors, and Guides of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For then people become Murderers and Robbers one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all places are filled with fears, dangers, cries, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all sorts. The evils we have felt in our own civil Wars, shew what misery it is to have Soldiers rule, and not Princes and Judges. And yet the evils we have seen are small, in comparison of what the Jewes felt by the factions there, when <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was besieged by <hi>Titus;</hi> But the evils, which would come on the world by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> if their project did take place, would far exceed them, their design being an universal destruction of them that oppose them in all the world, and when the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is perverted, there being no stay to mens furious zeal. If any say, that they would only smite oppressors of the Saints, I

reply, by their own rules they are bound to, <q>separate from those Churches which are select and more pure, as being seemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, which are the gathered in pastoral way (reducing things to primitive practise) so far as they are corrupted and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and found opposers of the Kingly office of Jesus Christ, in and over the whole world, and more especial in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this part or dispensation of that Kingdom, to wit, that of the Stone, or War against his enimies (for even in this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there be a sort of people, and those we hope godly, that do acknowledge &amp; wait in the expectation of the later, yea and hold forth the personal appearance of our Lord as King, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless oppose, and deny, and quite leap over this Stone and its work, thereby endeavouring to render the Saints useless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of destroying <hi>Babylon)</hi> which must make way, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot attain to the peaceable, and more glorious administration of this Kingdom, by removing those Mountains, Hills, and powers of darkness, which do oppose and hinder it. <hi>Banner displayed</hi> p. 75. There are no Churches, (or at leastwise very few) of the pastoral way in these Nations, or elsewhere, but have something of Antichrist in them, having forsaken and apostatized from the primitive and first love, and have, and do in many principle: and practises, strike hands with the interest of Antichrist, and mystery of iniquity, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3, 4. p. 79. We accompt it a duty for the Saints to separate from all the forms, practises, doctrines, and spirit of the Antichrist in the world, in their brethren, in the Churches, &amp;c. And to be plain, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt him, and that spirit which either in act or deed wilfully and obstinately denies the smiting work of our Lords Kingdom Antichristian; inasmuch as that such would alwaies have Christ, his Saints, his cause, in, and on the earth a sufferer: but the scripture clearly manifests the contrary, p. 81, 82.</q> now then, if men be they never so holy, <q>as they hope a sort of people be who oppose, deny, and quite leap over the Stone and its smiting;</q> (as they confess <hi>there are no Churches, or very few of the pastoral way in these Nations and elsewhere, but have opposed them)</hi> yet are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, they by their principles are to smite them, and so must oppress Saints as well as others. And if any Saints be civil powers, Ecclesiastical Rulers, Governors in Corporations, Graduates in Universities, Pastors in Churches, (as no doubt thousands are who love the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and wait for his appearing and Kingdom) yet these must be smitten too. And who can secure in such confusions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55931:35"/>
as would arise upon the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> smiting work, any man, yea of their own party, from violence, and slaughter, when there is nothing but rage in private persons, whose proceedings are in heat of mad zeal, without any distinction by legal trial and just judgment, or certain Rule? Sure no Tyrants have ever done more mischief than this way of the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men</hi> would do, if it were prosecuted, nor is any doctrine more hellish, Antichristian and damnable than this, that tends to overthrow all the civil powers, Lawes, Doctrines, Forms, Degrees, Offices in Church and State, which these term <hi>the spirit of Antichrist in the world.</hi> And if it were supposed, that these furious zelots should accomplish their design, after the mixture of hypocrites, and the rabble of the worst, &amp; most foolish men, who could hope there would be any peace, good order or justice in the world, or any remainder of sober men? The world would be an <hi>Acheldama,</hi> or <hi>field of blood</hi> (which they impute to <hi>the Nations of Europe, even the Protestant)</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing persons (to use their own phrase) <hi>Blood-Monsters,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a visible Kingdom of Christ in the earth a solitude, <hi>Chaos, tohu vebohu,</hi> as was afore the first creation, and the Kingdom of Antichrist, or the Devil would be set up under pretence of making Christs enemies his footstool.

                  <hi>arguments against the smiting work of</hi> Quinto-Monarchians <hi>from the meekness, peaceableness, and patience of Saints.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO these arguments, which have been confirmed, I shall add a ninth taken from the opposition of spirit and practise, which their doctrine begets to the precepts of meekness and peaceablness, which the Gospel requires of Christians, and to which it assigns bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness. Our Lord Christ in his <hi>sermon on the Mount, Matth.</hi> 5. 5. saith, <hi>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</hi> v. 9. <hi>Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the Children of God.</hi> v. 22. He forbids rash anger, contemptuous speech and opprobrious language.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55931:35"/>
v. 23, 24, 25. requires speedy endeavours of reconciliation with adversaries; nor is it any thing against this precept of Christ that he tels us, <hi>Luke,</hi> 12. 49. 51. <hi>I am come to send fire on the earth, and what will I, if it be already kindled? Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, nay; but rather division.</hi> For these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions do not shew his approbation of division, but his foresight of it, not as a thing which he affected, or as a thing desirable of it self, or which he studied to promote, but as a thing which he knew was unavoidable in the event, that while he endeavoured to promote the truth of the Gospel by accident divisions would follow, not from his doctrine, which was the Gospel of peace, but through the pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mens spirits, who would oppose it. But that it was the will of Christ, that all Christian Saints should be meek, and peaceable appears from the many precepts injoyning them in the Apostles writings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. <q>If it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. v. 19. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20. The workes of the flesh are hatred, enmities, variance, wrath, strise, seditions, divisions or factions. v. 22. 23. The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, meekness. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Follow peace with all men. <hi>James</hi> 3. 17. The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable. v. 18. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10, 11. He that will love life and see good daies, let him seek peace and ensue it.</q> From hence I argue, that doctrine is damnable and Antichristian, which is opposire to Christs, and his Apostles commands, approbation, and beatification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning meekness and peaceableness: But such is the doctrine of the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> which stirs up enmities and hostility among men, teacheth separations from men, even such <hi>as they hope are godly, from Churches, gathered in a pastoral way, reducing things to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive practise;</hi> and breaths out nothing but Wars, and smiting of all that denie or oppose their smiting work, which are as contrary to meekness and peaceableness, as hot to cold, black to white. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their doctrine is damnable and Antichristian. Nor can they be acquitted by alleging such texts as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 21, 22. and 137. 9. <hi>Amos.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16. unless they can shew all civil powers extant, and those, whom <hi>they hope to be godly, Churches gathered in a pastoral way reducing things to primitive practise,</hi> yet count enemies to Christs Kingdom, because they oppose that which these
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55931:36"/>
call the smiting work of the Stone, to be indeed haters of God, and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and also that these are the Stone, or <hi>the ten Horns that are to hate the Whore, and make her desolate.</hi> Till this be done (which I expect to be done at later Lammas) we may say as Christ did, ye know not what spirit ye are of: or rather deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, that they are indeed of an Antichristian, or Diabolical spirit.</p>
               <p>For a further inforcing of this argument I shall adjoyn a tenth, taken from those many texts of scripture, especially in the New Testament, which both require patience in the Saints, and assigne blessedness to it, and make suffering the portion of the Saints, and necessary to their entrance into the Kingdom of God, &amp; that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till Christs coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. <q>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsly for my sake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19. In your patience possess your souls, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> confirmed the souls of the Disciples, and exhorted them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 4, 5. So that we our selves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tribulations that ye endure, which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. Yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth every Son whom he receives <hi>James.</hi> 1. 4. Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>James.</hi> 5. 7. Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord.</q> Hence I argue, those who teach smiting, when Christ and his Apostles teach patience, those who count them <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, who would have Christ, his Saints, his cause in and on the earth a sufferer,</hi> though Christ, and his Apostles call it Christian to suffer, and require patience until the coming of the Lord, these teach doctrine, which is indeed damnable and Antichristian. But so do the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> as may be seen before <hi>Sest.</hi> 2. Therefore the doctrine of their smiting work is damnable and Antichristian.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THIS also leads us to an eleventh argument, which is from the constant profession of the Saints and Martyrs, in all ages, that they were to suffer for the Kingdom of God, not to fight for it, so speaks St. <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 1. 9. <q>I <hi>John</hi> who also am your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and companion in Tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ, was in the Isle that is called <hi>Patmos,</hi> for the word of God, and for the Testimony of Jesus Christ.</q> Where he makes these conjunct <hi>the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ,</hi> and styles himself their <hi>Brother and companion in Tribulation and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ,</hi> therefore he took all that were Brethren to be companions therein, and these to be conjoyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was the profession of the Saints, in the times of the ten great persecutions, as may be seen in the writings of <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and such as wrote Apologies for the Christians, and <hi>the Acts and monuments of the Church;</hi> which relate their practise suteable to their profession; even when they were armed, and were a considerable part of the Emperors Armies, yet exposed themselves rather to butchery, than they would attempt to fight. Yea when the Beast was risen, <hi>to whom the Dragon gave his power, and his seat and great authority,</hi> from which time, as is shewed before. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> make <hi>civil powers not to be the Ordinance of God, but Antichristian, and the Ordinance of Hell;</hi> yet the Holy Ghost foretels not the smiting work of the Stone, or turning their Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares into Swords, for the pulling down civil powers, and setting up the fifth Kingdom on earth, but saith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 10 <hi>He that killeth with the Sword must be killed with the Sword. Here is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the faith of the Saints.</hi> Which shewes that even they were not to set up the Kingdom of Christ by fighting, but by patience and faith. And <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 12. after the prediction of the fall of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the daughter of those <q>who worship the Beast and his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name, it is added, Here is the patience of the Saints: Here are they that keep the Commandments of God, &amp; the faith of J<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55931:37"/>

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of the smiting of civil powers to set up Christs Kingdom tend to the justifying, or countenancing of the Popish, former and later doctrine and practises, wherein they have challenged and usurped a power over Emperors, and Kings, to depose, and deprive them of life, when they have opposed the Popes Authority, or the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church and Religion, which opposition was counted by them to be against the Kingdom of Christ, and thought <hi>in ordine ad spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia,</hi> as they spake, they might dispose of their Kingdoms as the Vicars of Christ, and visible Monarchs of the Universal Church. Which things these Fifth-Monarchy-Men count <hi>Antichristian;</hi> and therefore their teaching and doing the like upon pretence of setting up of Christs Kingdom on earth, is by parity of reason, there being not better proof for the one than for the other, damnable and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian.</p>

               <head>§ 13. <hi>The smiting work of</hi> Quinto-Monarchians <hi>is grounded on falsities, or uncertainties concerning the agents, means and time of smiting mentioned,</hi> Dan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 34. 44, 45.</head>
               <p>HItherto I have prosecuted those arguments against the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> doctrine and practise which shew it to be damnable and Antichristian in respect of the act it self of smiting civil powers; I shall add further more arguments against them, shewing the falsity and uncertainty of those grounds and principles, on which their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations concerning separation from &amp; smiting of civil powers rest. The first whereof is, that <hi>afore the Fifth-Monarchy be set up, and in order thereto, afore Christs coming all civil powers, that are now extant as part of the fourth</hi> Monarchy, <hi>are to be disannulled.</hi> Which hath no foundation but in their own fancy, or hatred of the civil powers as withstanding their design. For it is said, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16, 17. <hi>That the Kings,</hi> which formerly supported <q>
                     <hi>Babylon</hi> shall hate the Whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their Kingdom unto the Beast, until
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55931:37"/>
the words of God be fulfilled, and <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 9.</q> It is said, <hi>That the Kings of the earth, who have committed fornication, and lived deliciously with her, shall be wail her and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning:</hi> which shewes, that Kings, even those that have joyned with <hi>Babylon,</hi> shall remain after her fall, yea and some Kings shall be the instruments of her destruction. And the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. tells us, <hi>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all Rule and all Authority and Power.</hi> Which words plainly intimate that afore the end, when Christ shall deliver up the Kingdom to God even the Father, all Rule and Authority and Power shall not be put down. Which may be also gathered from <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 15. where it is said, <q>And the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in Heaven saying, the Kingdoms of the world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever,</q> which is said v. 18. To be <hi>the time of the dead that they should be judged;</hi> and therefore till that time there shall be the Kingdoms of this world, and consequently civil powers.</p>
               <p>A second is, <hi>That civil powers are to be dissolved by men.</hi> Whereas this is still asserted in Scripture as Gods prerogative, that <hi>the most High ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, Dan.</hi> 4. 25. 32. 34, 35. and 5. 21. And even in the business of the fourth Monarchy, <hi>the stone</hi> that is said <hi>to smite the image upon his feet,</hi> is said <hi>to be cut out of the mountain without hands, Dan.</hi> 2. 34. 45. which is more likely to be meant of Christ, who was <hi>cut without hands out of the mountain,</hi> that is, without natural generation as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, whether by the Mountain be meant Eternity, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the Roman Empire, or the Universe of human kind, as I conceive, then of any other man or men. And if it be meant of the Kingdom, as v. 44. doth expound it, that <hi>it shall break in pieces and consume all these Kingdoms,</hi> it must be meant in respect of Christ the King, whose dominion is <hi>set up by the God of Heaven,</hi> and not by men, and therefore take it any way agreeable to the Text, <hi>the stones breaking in pieces and consuming all the Kingdoms</hi> must not be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Subjects, now calling themselves Saints, destroying civil powers, to which they are subject.</p>
               <p>A third is, <hi>That men shall dissolve civil powers by fighting with swords,</hi> which is very false: For <hi>the stone that smote the Image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth;</hi> which if it be understood of Christs spiritual Kingdom, it smote the Image by preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, by which the power of the Idols, who ruled in those Kingdoms,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55931:38"/>
was cast down, and by it <hi>the stone became a great mountain and filled the whole earth;</hi> if it be meant of smiting hereafter, it is to be, as 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. it is said, <hi>that wicked one the Lord shall consume with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming;</hi> or if it be meant of the Saints, as Mr. <hi>Thomas Parker</hi> conceives, <q>they are thus cut out by professed separation and victorious exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without hands, that is, by the only power and finger of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</q> as it is interpretted, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. v. 44, 45. Thus, saith he in his <hi>Exposition of that Vision,</hi> 
                  <q>they began to be cut out <hi>anno</hi> 1160 in the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and continue so unto this day. And the extraordinary hand of God was seen therein, as the strange ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, growth, prevailing of them doth manifestly declare. But their absolute cutting out an exemption from the power of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, is that which is to be expected at the term of the slaughter of the two Prophets: when their rising by the power alone of God Almighty, without the help of man is thus described, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 11. And after three daies and an half, the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that saw them: &amp; they ascended up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their enemies beheld them. And the same hour was there a great Earth-quake, and the tenth part of the City fell, and in the Earth-quake were slain of men, or names of men</q> (as in the Greek expounded by Mr. <hi>Mede, men of name) seven thousand,</hi> presently after which it followes, <hi>The Kingdoms of the world, are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ.</hi> Now be the Earth-quake, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> thinks, <hi>a great commotion of the Nations, and alteration of Politique Affairs,</hi> or some thing else, it is caused by Gods power either without man, or only by the witnesses and their testimony, and if the falling, and slaughter thereby be in whole, or in part, the smiting of the Stone, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. 44, 45. (as it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) it is not by fighting, sure not by such as overthrowes civil powers; for they shall be altered and be instrumental to destroy <hi>Babylon, Revel.</hi> 17. 16, 17. And therefore this (which is the hinge on which the smiting work of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> turns) being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertain, or rather very false, all their inferences thereupon must of necessity be groundless and unwarrantable.</p>
               <p>A fourth is, that <hi>the smiting work ascribed to the Stone, shall be by the Saints, even those who are private persons, and that the civil powers shall be smitten by them, to which they are subject,</hi> But for this they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but an obscure prophecy to rely upon, and it not agreeing with plain precepts, which forbid resistence to the higher
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55931:38"/>
powers that are, this their impious Collection is deservedly to be exploded and detested.</p>
               <p>A fifth is, that <hi>this smiting work shall be done by the Saints afore Christs coming, and in preparation thereto.</hi> But this agrees not with the Apostles words 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. where it is made Christs work <hi>to put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power,</hi> which will not be <hi>till the end,</hi> and then Christ, or his Father <hi>shall put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> which cannot be the work of the Saints. For <hi>one of the enemies is death</hi> v. 26. which none in his wits will say can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by <hi>Quinto-Monarchian</hi> Saints; they perhaps may bring death on themselves and others, but sure they cannot destroy death, who cannot raise from the dead. Besides the scripture makes <hi>the coming of Christ</hi> and <hi>his Kingdom</hi> comtemporary 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. therefore not to be effected by the Saints on earth, by any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory work of theirs.</p>
               <p>A sixth uncertainty or falsehood, which moves them to so much zeal for their smiting work, is, that <hi>they have fancied it to be the work of the present generation,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Tillinghast</hi> much insists on in his <hi>Sermon</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 3. concerning <hi>the signs of the times;</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how slender reasons may be shewed in what followes: sure when our Lord Christ made the time of his coming unknown to Angels and the son of man, and known only to the Father, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. he would have us not be curious to know it, but watch, that we be not surprised by it. And sith after all the labours of the learnedst and most prying inquisitors all the Prophetical numbers about this thing of the ruin of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Christs personal Kingdom on earth have been so uncertainly calculated, that mens expectations have been deluded, it is great rashness for any to pitch on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain year or age, much more to attempt such audacious and horrid things, as the smiting of civil powers in a preposterous way which attempt of theirs becomes the more inexcusable, in that their own writing entituled, <hi>The Banner of truth displayed,</hi> shewed their uncertainty, and unresolvedness both in the manner, extent and time of this smiting work. For whereas they apply that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 35. 44, 45. concerning <q>the stones smiting of the great Image so that the Iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold was broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the sommer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them:</q> unto the Saints, even Gentile Saints smiting of all parts of the fourth Monarchy, all the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Europe,</hi> which they count <hi>Roman, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi> yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55931:39"/>
p. 40, 41. they make <q>the conversion of the ten horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16, 17. to be one gradation of the stones growth, which although they would not have to be the present powers of the ten horns, nor yet multitudes of people in the ten horns, but some out of all the ten horns, whom the Lord will have mercy on, shall be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by Christ, in which respect it is said the ten horns; <hi>yet they</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the powers of the ten horns <hi>(which the text expresly v.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>terms</hi> ten Kings, which had received then no Kingdom, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast, who have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast, <hi>and are according to them part of the fourth Monarchy to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed)</hi> shall be subdued by the Saints; and as now they are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, and fight for the Beast against the Lamb, so shall they become Christians, and fighters for the Lamb against the Beast,</q> which is utterly inconsistent with the <q>being broken in pieces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the stones smiting, so as to become like the chaff of the sommer threshing-floor, and the wind carry them away, that no place be found for them, if the stones smiting them be their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing by the Saints.</q> And for the time of the beginning of their smiting work, which p. 46. they make <q>the ending time of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal numbers spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those great things which God hath declared by the mouth of all his holy Prophets to be brought to pass in these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2, 3. 12. 6. and 13. 5.</q> which they make a <q>great argument and quickning motive to the Saints to look about them, and for the stone to arise and smite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated Image, and break in pieces the iron teeth of the rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beast, that so deliverance may be brought, <hi>they grant,</hi> this thing which they lay down as a call to the stone is doubtful to most, <hi>and p.</hi> 47. <hi>tell us, that</hi> in this particular their judgment and opinion do most accord with Mr. <hi>Tillinghast</hi> his <hi>Calculation,</hi> according to which those things named &amp; spoken of to come to pass at the end of those numbers, would in all likelyhood have their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment together with the said numbers the year of Christ 1656.</q> But the event disproving it, <hi>they will not engage further therein,</hi> but set down other signs, which are signs only from themselves, and not from any divine revelation, and yet p. 52. conclude, <q>This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent generation in which we live is the ending time of those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical numbers forementioned, &amp; the expiring time of Antichrist, wherein God will begin to put a period to the Beasts tyranny and powers: And therefore cannot but assert, that the consideration
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55931:39"/>
of these things is a great call and motive to the stone to arise, and be doing, which work we call the fifth Kingdom in its first dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation, preparing way for the second and more glorious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation; <hi>But after mentioning</hi> the compleat and effectual call that the stone shall have to be a clear light into that time it shall smite, and into the work of that time, together with power from on high, whereby it shall be emboldened and fitted to smite as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; and also a fit and leading providence or opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring way for its breaking forth, with these golden characters of power, wisdom and glory:</q> and then adding some examples of Gods former providence, they say, <q>let the stone wait for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of these particulars afore it smite, &amp; add their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceit, <hi>&amp; then mind those</hi> who at present are the gainsayers and imbittered opposers (of this work, and yet hope and believe they are godly) of this their faith and hope, lest they split themselves upon this stone, becoming their rock of offence, and so their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and lives perish upon such an account in this day of common calamity that hasteth upon the whole world.</q> By which may be perceived their uncertainties in that, which they call their faith and hope, wherein those whom they believe to be godly oppose them, and their violence of spirit beyond all sobriety in moving persons so earnestly to that smiting work in this age upon no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds than their own conjecture, though they foresaw it would bring common calamity, and the bodies and lives of godly persons perish by reason of their opposition to this Stone, which shewes they were resolved to smite all that stood in their way though godly, as it fell out in the year 1660. Mr. <hi>Tillinghast</hi> in his first <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> p. 26. saith, <hi>the work of Christs Kingdom, the glorious beginning of it, shall be about the time of the Jewes coming in,</hi> and p. 39. saith, <hi>the Lord make us wait on him for his own time,</hi> and yet, <hi>Serm.</hi> 3. gives signes of its being near even in this generation, which he makes it the duty of Saints to observe, though not one of the signes is from any Revelation of God, but from things which may happen and have without such signification, as he would put upon them. I omit what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his <hi>letter to Arch-Bish<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

known Rules of scripture and Lawes of civil Government, it being in it self wicked, shewing bitter furious zeal without the wisedome from above, and likely hereafter, as it hath done formerly to others, to bring destruction of soul and body on the agents, and much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery on others whether opponents or neuters.</p>

Where. 1. they shew their inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency in <hi>making Gentile Saints, who are but subjects, the Stone meant</hi> Dan. 3. 34, 35. <hi>Excluding the Jewes from being the Stone in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> whereas <hi>the Stone</hi> is expresly termed <hi>the Kingdom, which shall stand for ever</hi> v. 44, 45. which cannot be understood of the Saints, who are subject, they are not <hi>the Kingdom,</hi> nor do <hi>they stand for ever;</hi> though <hi>they receive a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, Heb.</hi> 12. 28. But <hi>the Stone</hi> is Christ the King, and his Dominion, which must fill the whole earth with Subjects, Lawes and Administrations of Rule and Justice, which cannot be said of the Saints Gentile or Jewish.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55931:40"/>
in Scripture the Kingdom of Christ, and the Kingdom of Christ this stone, Dan.</hi> 2. 44, 45. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43, 44. <q>which, <hi>they say,</hi> hath a twofold dispensation, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1. An internal dispensation, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Kingdom, which is the Kingdom of Christ in the hearts of his Saints, and in and over his Church. 2. An external dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, 1. Of war, in subduing and conquering his stubborn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and opposers in the world, whereby they shall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to yield, and shall become subjects though Kings and Princes. 2. Of peace upon the earth, in and over the whole world; which is the new creation and restitution of all things, where will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; no sin; among the Saints immortality, &amp; no mortal nor corruptible thing, where death shall have no sting, nor grave victory; but all shall be swallowed up in Christs fulness, which is victory.</q> And for this they cite many scriptures in the margin. Now 1. I grant that <hi>the stone, Dan.</hi> 2. 44, 45. is <hi>the Kingdom of Christ or of God, Mat.</hi> 21. 43, 44. 2. The distinction of <hi>the internal &amp; external</hi> Kingdom is not denied. 3. Nor do I oppose the double dispensation of this Kingdom. 4. Nor do I deny the description of either dispensation. But 1. hence I infer, that <hi>the stone, Dan.</hi> 2. 44, 45. notes the <hi>internal Kingdom,</hi> or the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ had by the preaching of the Gospel, termed <hi>the Gospel of the Kingdom, Matth.</hi> 24. 14. meant <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43, 44. For 1. that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is meant there, and no other, which <hi>was to be taken from the Jews,</hi> but that could be no other than the internal Kingdom, for no other Kingdom was then among them but it, therefore no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there meant. 2. That Kingdom was there meant which was <hi>to be given to another Nation,</hi> meaning the Gentiles, but that was no other but the internal. 3. That Kingdom is there meant, whose <hi>fruits were to be brought forth by the Nation, to whom it was to be given:</hi> now the <hi>fruits of the Kingdom</hi> are expressed to be <hi>righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. which belong to the internal Kingdom, and therefore no other there meant. Which thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so confirmed by other passages of Scripture, as namely that of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 20. <q>When he was demanded when the Kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation, or with outward shew,</q> therefore <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> meant in the Gospel, is not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward visible Kingdom, which the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> expect, which is also proved from v. 21. where it is added, <q>Neither shall they say Lo here, or lo there: for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you or among you, which could be no other than the Kingdom set up by the preaching of the Gospel.</q> To which is to be added

The same thing might be gathered from the speeches of Christ, <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and the Apostles in many places, especially the parables of Christ, which shew that by the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> or <hi>of Heaven,</hi> is meant that dominion Christ hath over his Church by his Word and Spirit, which being the same with <hi>the Stone, Dan.</hi> 2. 44. 45. it follows that it began in Christs daies on earth, and that the <hi>smiting</hi> and <hi>filling the whole earth by the stone</hi> was effected by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which prevails against <q>the power of darkness, and brings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of the Son of Gods love, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13.</q> which I say not to exclude the Kingdom of Christ by such external discipline or rule as is meant 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20. when the Apostle saith, <q>For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power; but to shew what kind of Kingdom is meant, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. 45.</q> by the stone, which, I may truly say, is become <q>a stone of stumbling and rock of offence to the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi>

The like is to be said of Christs Kingdom in destroying the persecuting Emperors and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire by the sword of their own Soldiers, and chiefly by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the great his victories over <hi>Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> to whose time that is applyed by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> which we read <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 10, 11. <q>And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, now is come salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and strength and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.</q> And the like is to be conceived at the making the <hi>whore desolate, Rev.</hi> 17. 16. it is not denied, that this shall be by war, but none of these wars were or are to be managed by Saints as Saints, OF private persons subjects to other Lords.

The description made of the external dispensation of the Kingdom in peace may be allowed: But then it will not agree to the thousand years reign mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. For in that time there shall not be such a reign over the whole world, as that there shall be no enemies, nor sin; if so, how should <q>Satan, when he is loosed out of Prison at the expiration of the thousand years, deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to gather them to battel: the number of whom is as the sand of the Sea, and they go up on the breadth of the earth, and compass the Camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City, and then fire comes down from God out of Heaven and devours them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7, 8, 9?</q> Sure these things shew, that in the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years reign the Kingdom of Christ shall not be so universal and entire, but that in the four quarters of the earth, the <hi>Indians</hi> in the East, the <hi>Tarters</hi> in the North, the <hi>Americans</hi> in the West, and the <hi>Moors</hi> in the South shall remain a wicked people, and at last be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up by the Divel to destroy the people of God (which it is likely shall have a reign on the earth a thousand years, when the Jews shall be converted, and the <hi>Turkish</hi> tyranny, and <hi>Papal</hi> cruelty and delusions shall cease by such waies as divine providence shall order) and then by divine vengeance from Heaven shall be destroyed.

the world.</q> Out of which passages we may well infer 1. that it is great temerity in the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> to be so peremptory as they are, in setting down the time of the Saints taking the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: especially, if we consider, that when our Lord Christ was asked immediately afore his ascension into Heaven, <q>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to <hi>Israel?</hi> He said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6, 7.</q> wherein he gives us to understand, that the times and seasons of restoring the Kingdom to <hi>Israel</hi> are put by the Father in his own peculiar power, and therefore were not to be then known to the Apostles, nor to us, till by the events shewing the foregoing signs, and the special instinct of Gods Spirit was shewed the just period of the mystical numbers, in which they are to be fulfilled. 2. We may infer, that it is very great folly, pride and arrogant presumption for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gentile Saints in an Island or Continent to think to smite the fourth Monarchy by Arms, <q>which is to be destroyed by the Spirit of the Lords mouth, and the brightness of his coming,</q> and to take to themselves a Kingdom which God only can give, and to set up Christs Kingdom, which God makes his prerogative, <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. 6. <q>Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion, <hi>Ps.</hi> 110. 1, 2. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord shall send the Rod of thy strengh out of Zion: Rule thou in the mids of thine enemies;</q> and to think to do this by armes a feeble means, which is to be done not by might, nor by power, but by his spirit. The monstrous arrogance of this attempt is made the more hainous 1. because, when it hath been begun heretofore by any, they have found God against them, the Lord by his providence dissipating their counsels and frustrating their attempts, so as that in fine they have only brought ruin to themselves, and occasioned hatred of the wayes of God, and a hard hand in civil powers on the innocent. Which argument, although it do not Universally hold, that what succeeds not well in the event pleaseth not God, yet is good against these men, who have no other ground or warrant to their attempts, but the opinion they have of Gods putting it into their heart and assurance of his help, this being their own speech <hi>Banner displayed,</hi> p. 89. <q>So that we make our conclusion (with <hi>Manoahs</hi> Wife of old) if the Lord were pleased to kill us (or suffer our enemies to kill us) he would not have received a burnt offering, and a meat offering at our hands; neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would [as at this time] have told
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55931:43"/>
us such things as these, <hi>Judges</hi> 13. 23.</q> which shewes that the chief thing animating them to that bloody attempt was the opinion they had, that their determinations were of God, and that they were assured of help from him; which was the very thing that <hi>Thomas Muncer,</hi> and <hi>Hacket,</hi> and such like unquiet spirits were of Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by, and ended in nothing but blasphemy of God, and reproach of Religion. 2. Their abuse of scriptures wrested by unstable and unlearned persons to their destruction, arguing from obscure passages against plain precepts doth aggravate their evil acts, it being no small evil to make the holy scriptures, which are for humility, meekness, patience, trust in God, peaceableness, an instrument to commotions, disobedience to superiors, shedding blood, &amp; such like horrid wickedness.

               <head>§ 15. <hi>The claim which</hi> Quinto-Monarchians <hi>make to Civil government on earth in the Saints afore Christs coming is false.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving shewed the sinfulness of smiting civil powers, the vanity of the conceits about the <hi>Stone, Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 35. the falsity of the notions about the fifth-Monarchy, I shall now examin their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Saints right to the Kingdom on earth before Christs coming; about which are held many false and pernicious positions which I shall now discuss. The first is, that before cited by me sect. 2. in these words, <q>The creature man was priviledged with being Lord over inferior creatures, but not over his own kind; for all men being alike priviledged by birth, so all men were to enjoy the creatures alike without propriety one more than another.</q> Which position is manifestly false even concerning the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uncorrupt. For even then <q>the man was the head of the woman, as the Apostle asserts</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. and proves v. 8. 9. from the womans creation: <hi>For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man: neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man;</hi> which plainly proves a dominion and propriety of the man over and in the woman, who is of his own kind, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrine would infer not only polygamy, but also community of Wives, which was the very Doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitanes,</hi> of which Christ saith in two Epistles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 6. 15. <hi>which thing I bate.</hi> The same also may be said concerning Father and child even in nature uncorrupt, if there had been any child born in that state, they would not have been all alike priviledged by birth, but <hi>the creature man was priviledged with being Lord over his own kind,</hi> nor <hi>were all men to enjoy the creatures alike without propriety</hi> but <hi>one more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the Father being priviledged by birth above his child, so as to be Lord over his child, and enjoy him with propriety, and not another his child, nor he anothers: nor is it to be conceived, but that in Goods, Cattel and Fruits of the earth, there would have been propriety in them so, as that the Wife was to be at the Husbands disposing and allowance concerning them, and the child at the Fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second (which is the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> opinion cited
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55931:44"/>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.) is <q>that all men, as they are men have lost their rights and priviledges in respect of Government in the first <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </q> Which is false. For, 1. Our Lord Christ in the point of divorce doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, that divorces allowed by the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not right, because they agreed not with the law of marriage in the beginning, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6. which argument of our Lord rests on this proposition, that what law was made in the beginning was in force still, and consequently the right of Government, which a Husband had above his Wife, a Father above his Child, continue still. 2. If <hi>all rights and priviledges in respect of Government in the first Adam were lost,</hi> then they are still lost to them that are not in Christ, which if it were true, all unbelievers would be usurpers: But this is false. For 1. the government of Husbands over Wives remains to infidels, the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ch. 13. 4. tels us, that <hi>marriage is honourable in all,</hi> therefore in infidels. If not, then the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13. did not rightly determine, that <hi>the woman, which had a husband that believed not, if he were pleased to dwell with her, was not to put him away,</hi> or <hi>leave him;</hi> which supposeth, that the right and power of a husband remained in him, though an infidel; for, where the bond of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage continues, the right and priviledge in Government belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to it still continues. The same also is to be said concerning the right &amp; priviledge of a parent in respect of the child, it remains as well to infidels as believers, and also Masters over servants. For even such as were evil or froward, from whom they were likely to suffer, yet the Apostle 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 18, 19. would have Christians to be <hi>subject to them for conscience towards God;</hi> therefore they had a right of Government over them, who were infidels, even by Gods appointment.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men</hi> themselves in the <hi>Banner displayd</hi> p. 51. acknowledge, <hi>that the powers of old Rome the a bloody persecutor were ordained of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. and therefore even infidel powers have right and priviledge of Government by their own concession. And indeed the Apostles determinations 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24. are plain resolutions, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian calling, doth neither make men free, nor servants, nor alter their civil relations, but that the Christian is, as he was, neither better nor worse in that regard. 2. If infidels were usurpers of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then what ever sentence they past, it was unjust, though it were never so right in respect of the cause, it being done by him that was no Judge, whereas the scripture makes even the infidel powers <q>Gods Ministers revengers, <hi>or</hi> doers of right unto wrath unto him that doth evil.</q> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. 3. If they were usurpers, then did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55931:45"/>
Christ ill to bid to pay tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to acknowledge <hi>Pilates</hi> power given him from above, <hi>John</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Paul</hi> to appeal to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to say, <hi>he stood before Caesars judgment Seat, where he ought to be judged, Acts</hi> 25. 10, 11. he should not have said, <q>I think my self happy King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> because I shall answer for my self before thee this day, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 2.</q> nor to <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 10. <q>Forasmuch as I know, that thou hast been of many years a Judge unto this Nation, I do the more chearfully answer for my self,</q> he should have declined his audience, or sentence, as being <hi>coram non judice,</hi> or have termed him <hi>a man,</hi> without any shew of reverence, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as the Quakers are wont to do, or have termed him <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> as the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> do the civil powers now extant. In a word no honour should be due to an unblieving Prince, though St. <hi>Peter</hi> bids, <hi>honour the King</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. and the arguments urged before Sect: 3. should be evacuated. 4. If all right and privledges in respect of Government in the first <hi>Adam</hi> were lost among infidels, so as that all infidel judges were usurpers, then among them Judges were not unjust, though they did not right to the wronged, because they had no power, and so the Judge, who <hi>feared not God, nor regarded man,</hi> had not been rightly termed by our Lord Christ, <hi>an unjust Judge, Luke</hi> 18. 6. for not avenging the Widdow. Nor <hi>Pharoah,</hi> or <hi>Abimelech,</hi> justly punished for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing <hi>Abrams</hi> Wife, nor any just War between the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> and other Kings, nor had <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> any just possession of the Cave <hi>Abraham</hi> bought, nor any just contract between <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> nor did <hi>David</hi> justly defend <hi>Toi</hi> against <hi>Hadadezer,</hi> nor is there any justice in contracts, or comerce with infidels to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, nor they capable of doing right, or wrong, if there be no just legislative power, or power of judicatory among them, but <hi>they bear the sword,</hi> if not <hi>in vain,</hi> yet unjustly, and therefore are ill charged by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>To be filled with all unrighteousness.</hi> A third position, which with inconsiderate men takes, as being in shew agreeable with scripture, and tending to Christs honour, though as they mean and use it, it is both false and pernicious, is, that <q>Jesus Christ is the only lawful and true begotten Heir, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, and potentate of these three Nations, and of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, and (as he is the seed of <hi>Abraham)</hi> shall possess the Earth: Yea and the very gates of his enemies; and that the sole legislative power of the Nations, is and doth of right appertain and belong to him, and shall be exercised by him,</q> 
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. 6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55931:45"/>
hath been usual with the men of this persuasion, not only to style Christ King <hi>Jesus</hi> (which is his right) but also to disavow any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King but King <hi>Jesus,</hi> as if the owning of any other as King in these Nations were indeed a renouncing Christ from being their King. Now it is to be granted. 1. That the Lord Jesus Christ not only as he is the Son of God, but also as man, is of right, and is to be acknowledged <q>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. To whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. God hath made him Lord and Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. He is Lord of all, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36.</q> Nor is it denyed that the texts quoted do belong to him: or that <hi>he is the Heir of all the Nations of the Earth, as he is the seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>to whom the promises were spoken.</hi> Yet the words, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 27. mention his Kingdom not <q>till the judgment sit, and they shall take away the Dominion of the little Horn, to consume and to destroy it unto the end;</q> and therefore assert not the exercise of the Kingdom there meant as yet. The words <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 7. are impertinently alledged concerning Christs being <hi>King of Nations as the seed of Abraham;</hi> sich they are spoken only of the Divine nature in opposition to the Idols of the Nations. The words <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. 6, 7. foretold Christs Kingdom in the daies of his flesh, which Christ himself saith, <hi>was not of this world,</hi> but such as belonged to him as the <hi>Child born, of the increase of whose Government there should be no end.</hi> The words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. are true of Christ personal, but so also, as that they have respect to all believers as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed by faith v. 7. 29. and that they are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of a visible Monarchy acquired by fighting (of which the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> dream) but of the inheritance of the righteousness, by faith, which should be to all Nations v. 28. in which respect <hi>Abraham</hi> also is said to be <hi>the Heir of the world, Rom.</hi> 4. 13. 2. It is not to be denied, that all Kings ought to acknowledge Christ their superiour, and themselves to be subordinate to him, and that those, who will not acknowledge the holding of <hi>their power, Crownes and Scepters under this great Monarch,</hi> and for him, <q>shall be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and adjudged by Christ as Traitors to him, and proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst accordingly by him, according to his Lawes; and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27.</q> But 1. this will be done by him in such way as he thinks good, he hath not made any Saints on earth Judges over Kings, whether they be Traitors to Christ or not, nor allowed them to proceed against them, nor hath he assigned any time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will proceed against them afore the great day of judgment, in which he will judge the Saints as well as Kings, and will damn
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55931:46"/>
them that pretending themselves Saints, shall take upon them Christs peculiar Office to judge their Kings, and execute judgment (that is outrage and murder) on their Governours to whom Christ requires their subjection. Sure <hi>Paul,</hi> when he reasoned with <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 25. did nor go about to terrify him with threatning of any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he, or the Saints on earth had, but minded him <hi>of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come.</hi> Nor did our Lord Christ himself, either to <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the High Priest use any menacing speeches, but only told the High Priest, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 64. <q>Hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven.</q> 2. This will nothing concern the King of these three Nations, nor any other Kings, or Rulers, who do acknowledge they Rule under Christ, and Rule for Christ, and therefore cannot with any colour be adjudged as enemies to Christ by those, who have no cognizance of the secrets of mens hearts, nor any way or power of judicature in such things, but must leave them to the trial of the Universal Judge. 3. We grant, that, so far as Christ hath made any lawes pertaining to civil, or Church Government, Kings have no power to abrogate or alter them, but are bound, according to that Authority they have, to see them executed and observed; yea and to repress them, that pretend themselves Saints, as Traitors both to them and Christ, from whom they have authority, who appose their power, and hinder their actings in that which is agreeable to Christs lawes. For if they be not Officers under Christ as mediator (which I assert not) yet they are Rulers under Christ as the Son of God, and will be owned and assisted by him, in doing his work against any that pretends himself Christs Vicar, or lurks under the Vizour of a Saint. But as I said before, Sect. 6. 1. The lawes of Christ are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without other lawes to settle and order thousands of particulars whether belonging to the Church, or Common-wealth, but that there is need of humane lawes to determin them. 2. That the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish lawes are not fitted for the Government of Christian states, and Churches of the Gentiles, except in some few. 3. That the Lord Christ and his Apostles did of purpose leave us at liberty concerning them, lest the Gospel should be hindered by them, and permitted all Nations to order their own lawes and civil Government accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to general precepts of the word and the exigence of civil affairs. 4. That to tie men to Mosaical civil precepts, any further than the general equity of them requires, would be to <hi>Judaize.</hi> 5. That the most holy Saints that are on earth, are and will be bound to observe humane lawes of their civil seperiors under pain of God;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55931:46"/>
wrath till Christ at his coming put down all rule and all authority and power. 6. That it no whit detracts from Christs supreme domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to have Kings to be Rulers under him, and therefore we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that speech cited sect. 2. <hi>Jesus Christ alone is Lord and King, and all men are equals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth position deduced from the third, is, <hi>that the Saints of the most high are by themselves a Common-wealth and Free-state,</hi> which is somewhat like the opinion of <hi>Papists</hi> who exempt men in holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the secular power, and it is not unlikely to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled into the minds of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> by some of the popish party; But is a false and foolish conceit, refuted by all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before produced, requiring subjection to civil powers, even such as are evil, and proving, even agreeably to the state of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind corrupt, that civil power and natural power of government belongs to Infidels over Saints, and therefore Saints cannot without injury shake off the yoke of allegiance and obedience, which is upon them by the imposition of civil and natural powers, though unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. It is also foolish, For 1. it supposeth Saints may be by themselves, which is contrary to the express Doctrine of our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 30. which tels us, that <hi>the tares and the wheat are to grow together until the Harvest,</hi> which he expounds after v. 40, 41. that it shall be the end of the world afore the wicked and the children of the Kingdom shall be separated: which he also teacheth by another parable v. 47, 48, 49, 50. All those who are for gathered Churches, though they would have none in Church communion but visible Saints, yet are forced to acknowledge from these Scriptures, that they must live together, whether they will or no, in the world, and therefore this, and indeed the whole project of the <hi>Quinto-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians,</hi> is but a fond dream, and too like the <hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellions</hi> of old in <hi>Africa.</hi> But were it granted, that there may be, or have been Plantations of godly persons unmixt: yet experience hath shewed, that even amongst them differences quickly arise, by reason of different apprehensions, and divisions and enmities, and in a little time heats, animosities, factions, oppositions and other corruptions follow. Besides, who can secure the generation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from corruption? <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> settled the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> with order, laws, rites of Religion, and all by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction from God: yet quickly did they corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The like may be said of the times succeeding <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> Our own times yield like instances, that the posterity of the best and holiest Planters, though free from many provocations,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55931:47"/>
which the people have from whom they remove, yet in an age do degenerate from their predecessors holiness, and in their manners and government become like other people. And what we have seen in our daies, of the giddiness, shallowness, instability, selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the choicest men for government, and holiness, whom men could find in a Nation, should me thinks awaken men from conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in that dream, no better than the fancy of a golden moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as if they might have a Common-wealth or Free-state or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Church by themselves on earth of pure Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But were this feasible, that there were a Common-wealth or Free state of uncorrupt Saints by themselves on earth afore Christs appearing, yet without such promise and provision made for them by Christ, as we yet have no assurance of, they would not subsist long, but perhaps be, as the Historians phrase is, <hi>populus unius aetatis,</hi> a people of one age, by reason of the weakness they would have to resist their enemies, which would be more in number than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, perhaps a thousand fold, and their enmity be encreased as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> was to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and either oppress them or destroy them. If after the thousand years reign the <hi>Divel could go out to deceive the Nations, which are in the four quarters of the earth,</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog, <hi>to gather them to battel, their number being as the sand of the Sea, and they go up on the breadth of the earth, and compass about the Camp of the Saints and the beloved City, Rev.</hi> 20. 8, 9. It is much more likely, while Satan is at liberty and millions of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies infidel Pagans, cruel Mahometans, bloody Papists, profane and vitious Protestants, unquiet and unruly members in the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, loose Libertines, and erroneous Revolters from pure worship, true doctrine, and true Christian conversation in duties of love and righteousness, walk on every side, that a small number of Saints in profession should have more enemies against them, if they did live by themselves on earth, as an entire and independent Common-wealth. If in Christs retinue there were a <hi>Judas,</hi> can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny company of Saints secure themselves from hypocritical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and their treachery? Sure the little flock of Christ is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Kings and Rulers, and Laws, and Government, though with some rigour and persecution, than they are sensible of, or thankful for as they should be. We have seen how unsuccessful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been to reform Churches, to rectify Governments as we desire, how like Tinkers work alterations in them have been, that while one hole is stopped two are made, how many various forms of Government have been devised, whereof one hath opposed the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55931:47"/>
other, that while they have been hammering on a new frame all hath fallen to pieces, every one likely agreeing about what they would not have, few about what they would have. And therefore it would be more agreeable to the mind of God, for Christians now though under many grievances and pressures to subject themselves peaceably even to hard Rulers, and as God admonished the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon to pray for their peace, for in their peace they should have peace, and to seek the peace of them, Jer.</hi> 29. 7. till God call them out of <hi>Babylon</hi> by his providence, and not either by flying from them as enemies desert their station (wherein by their abiding they might perhaps through their good conversation amend them, or by their patience pacify them) or by reviling provoke them, or by conspiracies or tumults incense them against them, much less after the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> furious manner take up arms to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Free-state, and Lords of the world.</p>
               <p>The fifth position is, that <hi>Saints regained the rights and priviledges in respect of Government in the second</hi> Adam <hi>or Lord from Heaven,</hi> which position is deduced out of the former, but is false and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. For 1. it supposeth that <hi>the rights and priviledges in respect of Government were lost in the first</hi> Adam, which is before proved false. 2. That <hi>the second</hi> Adam, <hi>or Lord from Heaven, hath regained them:</hi> whereas there is no Text of Scripture that doth mention, that this was the end of his coming into the world to get for himself or for his Disciples the actual regiment or government of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world in an outward manner by making and executing Laws about civil affairs, nor was this ever claimed by Christ or his Apostles, but when <hi>he perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a King, he departed again into a mountain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone, John</hi> 6. 15. and when <hi>one of the company said unto him, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, speak to my Brother, that he divide the inheritance with me, he said unto him, man, who made me a Judge or Divider over you? Luke</hi> 12. 13. 14. which plainly shews Christs refusal of medling with civil affairs, though it were but by speaking for one brother to another, yea and his disclaiming any civil office or judicature as not belonging unto him. And his whole estate of life, and deportment in the daies of his flesh was altogether incongruous to a civil government, or rule; nor did he ever disturb <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> the high Priests or Elders of the Jews about their government, but only he once drave the <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi> out of the Temple by special instinct, and rode on an Asse into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to shew his right as the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved the wickedness of the Jewish Rulers and Pharisees, yet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55931:48"/>
still requiring those that were healed of leprosy, to go to the Priests and shew themselves to them for a testimony to them, that he was not against the observance due by the Law to them. It is indeed said <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>That to this end Christ both died, and rose and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant in respect of civil government on earth, and the rights and priviledges thereof, but the spiritual rule he hath over them now, and the great dominion he shall have at the universal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father, Phil.</hi> 2. 10. 11. yea this thing was the very stumbling block of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, by reason of which they denied his Kingdom, and his being the <hi>Messiah;</hi> because he did not take upon him civil rule, nor by human forces subdue the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> but by invisible power cast out <hi>Divels,</hi> healed diseases, rebuked storms, and multiplyed loaves, and did such other acts, and gave such laws as were altogether unsutable to the King and Kingdom which they fancied and expected. So that this conceit of <hi>Christs regaining the rights and priviledges in respect of Government, which was lost in the first</hi> Adam, meaning the outward visible government of the world in respect of civil affairs, is but a Jewish opinion altogether disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Christian Doctrine. It is true, that the Apostles minds did oftentimes hanker after it, contending sundry times who should be chiefest among them, and the two brethren <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> by their Mother asking the two nearest places to Christ in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but they were checked by Christ expresly telling them, <hi>that to sit at his right hand or his left was not his to give, but for whom it was prepared of his Father, Matth.</hi> 20. 23. shewing thereby that in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state he had no such Kingdom, or Throne as they dreamed of, nor was to have; nor the disposal of such places as they ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sought, but told them of their suffering afflictions, and to all his Apostles said, <hi>Ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them, but it shall not be so among you</hi> v. 25, 26. yea when they would know, who <hi>should be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, he called a little child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle child the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, 4. declaring plainly, that all affecting government, and superiority in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55931:48"/>
this world was contrary to his Kingdom, and therefore the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous ambition of <hi>Quinto-Monarchians,</hi> of getting into their hands the Kingdoms of this world, is as contrary to Christianity as bitter to sweet, darkness to light, or rather indeed Antichristian, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish, being under another disguise the same with the <hi>Popes</hi> claim of Universal Monarchy, as Vicar of Christ, of having both swords Spiritual and Temporal, therein <hi>lifting himself above all that is caled God, or is worshipped</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4. It is true that it is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God hath in these last dayes spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things;</hi> But this inheritance is either as he is the Son of God, according to his divine nature, or his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at his exaltation into Heaven, in that sense, in which he is said to be made <hi>head over all things, to, or for the Church, Ephes.</hi> 1. 22. which is to be understood in respect of that power over Angels and Men, so far as concerns their Administation of all things, for the welfare of his Church, in neither of which are the Saints Heirs with him. But in neither of these senses, nor in any other sense, or place of scripture is he said to be <hi>the Heir of the world</hi> so, as that he should <hi>regain the rights and priviledges in respect of civil Government lost in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> nor where <hi>Abraham</hi> is promised to be <hi>Heir of the world, Rem.</hi> 4. 13. is it meant in respect of the civil Government of the world, but as the text shews, that he should <hi>be Heir of the world,</hi> that is the blessing of righteousness should be to Jewes and Gentiles through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, walking in the steps of his examplary faith, whereby they become his seed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It asserteth, that <hi>Saints regained the rights and priviledges, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Government in the second Adam, or Lord from Heaven;</hi> which is a false and a most arrogant presumptuous position. For, 1. If Christ have not regained it for them, then they have not regained them in him. But that Christ hath not regained it for them, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved in overthrowing the second supposition; therefore Saints have not regained in Christ the rights and priviledges, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Government civil. 2. If Government civil were not lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> then it is not regained in Christ, but civil Government and natural were not lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> as is before proved in this section; therefore they were not regained in Christ. 3. If the rights and priviledges of civil Governments were not regained in Christ to the Apostles, then they were not regained in Christ to any Saints; For none had more regained for them by Christ than the Apostles, nor any of the Saints excelled them; if any can shew better charters, or patents from Christ for such rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55931:49"/>
then the Apostles, let them shew them; the holy scripture tells us, that <hi>God hath set in the Church first Apostles,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 28. they are in <hi>the foundations, Eph.</hi> 2. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 14. But, that the Apostles had not the rights and priviledges in respect of civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on earth, afore Christ's coming in the Clouds, is proved before from Christs words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 25, 26. from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. where <hi>every Soul,</hi> even <hi>an Apostle,</hi> saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> is <hi>to be subject to the Higher Powers,</hi> from St. <hi>Paul</hi> his acknowledgments and example of subjection, from St. <hi>Peters</hi> precept and example. Whence we account the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to have the forehead of and impudent Whore, when they claim in St. <hi>Peters</hi> right, the Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the whole Church, and superiority above Emperors and Kings, and directly, or indirectly in order to spirituals, power to dispose of civil Governments, to translate the Empire, depose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, give away Kingdoms, command Emperors to make an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the holy Land, and many more things, as if they were his right, as successor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom Christ promised <hi>the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> not of earth. If this claim be justly, as it is, judged to be an <hi>Antichristian, Babylonish</hi> usurpation, it is by parity of reason. More <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>Babylonish</hi> for the <hi>Quinto-Monarchans</hi> to challenge the rights and priviledges in respect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be gained to them under the name of Saints, when they can shew no such donation from Christ, or any act of acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he obtained it for them, or any conveyance of it to them, or any Saints till Christs appearing; The Apostles <hi>shall sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Israel,</hi> but not till <hi>the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit in the Throne of his golory, Matth.</hi> 19. 28. termed his <hi>Kingdom, Luke.</hi> 22. 30. <hi>The Saints shall Judge the world,</hi> but not till the time come <hi>they shall Judge Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. In the interim their condition is to be <hi>humbled under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt them in due time</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>James</hi> 4. 10. 4. If the portion of the Saints which is regained for them by Christ be in spiritual blessings in heavenly things, and no where in temporal Dominion in this life, then it is false, that Saints regained the rights and priviledges in respect of Government in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> or Lord from Heaven, but the antecedent is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as appears by the many promises to them, which assign spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to them as their portion. Where the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> mentions the blessings given to the faithful in Christ <hi>Jesus</hi> he saith, <hi>Ephes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. 3. <q>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritural blessings in heavenly places, or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55931:49"/>
things in Christ, and then recites them without mention of any earthly power or preferment.</q> In the new covenant set down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. Spiritual grace is promised, but not earthly greatness, and riches as in the old. Where our Lord Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. assignes blessedness to holy persons, he placeth it in other things, then the Kingdoms of this world. He saith, v. 5. <hi>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,</hi> but no where the Dominions of the earth. The Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <q>Bodily exercise profiteth little, or for a little time, but godliness is profitable for all things, or for every time, having the promise of the life that now is, and that which is to come.</q> But how to understand this our Saviour tells us, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 29, 30. <q>There is no man that hath left House, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Lands for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, Houses, and Brethren, and Sisters, and Mothers (which cannot be understood in the same kind, but in that which is equivalent) &amp; Children, and Lands, with persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the world to come, eternal life.</q> We are <hi>Heirs with Christ,</hi> but 'tis, <q>If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the World, or Life, or Death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours; and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 23, 24.</q> But all are not theirs to dispose them, or to rule over them, they cannot dispose of life, or death, things to come, nor have rule over <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Cephas.</hi> But God doth order and dispose them for their benefit in the event, as it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <q>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to purpose.</q> The Saints <hi>shall inherit all things,</hi> but they must <hi>overcome</hi> first, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>By the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Testimony, not loving their lives unto the death, Revel.</hi> 12. 11. No where is there a promise of the rights and priviledges of civil Government to the Saints on earth. 5. If the holy scripture makes it an ill character of a man, and an accursed condition to have his treasure on earth, his portion in this life, his good things here, to be his danger, and an ill fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding sign to be rich, that the desire and care of these things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and insnare men, choke the word of God, that it becomes unfruitful, then sure they have not regained the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in respect of Government in the second <hi>Adam.</hi> But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true, as is manifest in these Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 19, 20, 24, 25. and 13. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 24, 25. and 16. 25.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55931:50"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9, 10. therefore also the later; and therefore we may more truly say, that the men who make this claim, do indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saint themselves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it be Gods design to have, for the most part the holy Saints to be of the meanest sort, then sure they have not regained the rights and priviledges in respect of civil government and possessions in this life. But the former is true, as appears by these Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26, 27, 28, 29. <q>You see your Calling, Brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many, noble are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the World to confound the things that are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen; and things which are not to bring to nought things which are, that no flesh should glory in his presence. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and Heirs of that Kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him.</q> Therefore the Saints regain not priviledges of government in this life,</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Princes of this world</hi> are often distinguished, then Saints as such have not regained the rights and priviledges in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of government in this life; But they are so distinguished, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 6, 8. Therefore the Consequent is right.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Saints <hi>receive that Kingdom which cannot be shaken,</hi> then their interest is not in the Kingdoms of this world that <hi>come to nought,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. But the former is true, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. Therefore also is the later.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If Christ have made the Saints <hi>Kings and Priests to his Father,</hi> not to men, a <hi>royal Priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</hi> then that which Christ hath effected for the Saints is not the gaining of the rights and priviledges in respect of civil government. But the former is true, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. and 5. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. 9. therefore also the later is true.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If the Saints be exceeded in wisdom and power fit for civil government by the men of this world, then sure Christ did not regain for them the rights and priviledges in respect of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this world: For sure, if he had gained the end he would have provided and ordered the means, as is done by him in respect of the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven or eternal life. But the antecedent is true, as appears by our Saviours words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light,</hi> and all experience in all ages, which shews how few
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55931:50"/>
of them are fit for managing of civil government, therefore the rights and priviledges in respect of civil government in this life are not provided for them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If the rights and priviledges in respect of civil government were gained for the Saints, then doubtlesse Christ would have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them in the way and means to have attained them, but that he hath no where done, but left all Nations to their own constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and waies of government, therefore Christ hath not gained for the Saints the right to civil government.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If the rights and priviledges in respect of civil government were gained by Christ for the Saints, then they that are not Saints are not Governors of right, then no King is rightly a King, no Master rightly a Master, no Husband rightly a Husband, or Father rightly a Father, or Tutor rightly a Tutor, but a Saint. But this is false as hath been shewed abundantly before, the Scripture acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, yea the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> themselves acknowledging e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the powers that were the Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> though bloudy Persecutors of the Saints, the Ordinance of God, therefore Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment civil is not the Saints right and priviledge.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If the Saints had regained by Christ the rights and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in respect of Government then they had right to require Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and service of men, and consequently what they impose is due to them, and then they should not be guilty of unrighteousness, theft, purloining, though they took from infidel masters or other unbelievers. But the Scriptures make believers or Saints culpable for extortion, theft, purloining, covetousness, defrauding as well as others 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 28. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 6. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. 10. 12 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. therefore they have not the rights and priviledges in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Government.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If the Saints have regained the priviledges and rights in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of civil government in Christ, then either as Saints, or under some other consideration; if under some other consideration, then it is not by reason of their sanctity or their interest in Christ; if as Saints, then all Saints have these rights of Government; and if so, a child that is a Saint, a Wife, a Servant, over an infidel Father, Husband, Master, which would invert all order, and make voyd all the precepts of <hi>obeying Parents, Ephes.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>submitting to Husbands, Eph.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>obedience to Masters, Eph.</hi> 6. 5. all which are grosly absurd making void the commandments of God for human traditions.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If the Saints have the rights and priviledges in respect of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment regained in Christ, then either Saints by profession or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55931:51"/>
real only: not the former, for such are hypocrites, children of Hell more than others, and therefore Christ hath purchased nothing for them by his death or intercession; not the later, for then rights and priviledges in respect of government should be a <hi>nemo scit,</hi> a thing which no man can judge of, but he who can search the heart and try the reigns; but rights and priviledges in respect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are things necessary to be known, that we may know to whom we are bound to be subject, to pay tribute, to address our selves to for justice, and other ends and uses of Empire.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If Saints have the rights and priviledges in respect of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then those only have power to make Governors, as Kings and their Officers, who make Saints, especially Preachers, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Pastors of Churches. But the Scripture makes this no part of a Ministers work, he is not to <hi>intangle himself in affairs of this life,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. this is never intimated to have been done, or that it should be done: they are said to be <hi>of God, his ministers,</hi> not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Saints or Pastors of Churches, nor did ever any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to be the right of Church Officers to constitute Kings and civil Governors, till the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> usurped that power to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Emperors, whose Predecessor <hi>Gregory</hi> the great acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Emperor <hi>Mauricius</hi> to be his Lord, and the like was done by other Popes to the Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> until the time of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> named <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, whom <hi>Becket</hi> in <hi>England</hi> followed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him to annul the English Laws, and asserting the Kings power to be from the Church.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If the rights and priviledges in respect of Government be the Saints, then they cease to be Governors when they cease to be Saints, and so the opinion heretofore charged unjustly on <hi>Wickleff,</hi>

Christians, if they see they must possesse their Dominion at the will of Ecclesiasticks, with many other great absurdities. We find in Scripture Kings have deposed Priests, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did <hi>Abiathar</hi> by Gods allowance, but no where Priests to have deposed Kings with any approbation: This hath been but of late, a thing hatch'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and fetch'd from Hell.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If the Saints have the rights and priviledges in respect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment regained in Christ, then is temporal dominion founded in grace, But that is not true, sith it is given out of common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the good of human society, not out of special love to the Saints: For it is one of the things that is for the benefit of the bad as well as the good, as the shining of the Sun, and the falling of the rain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 45. and therefore the benefit of it is sometimes deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the good, and granted to the bad, so that in these things all <hi>are alike, one event is to the righteous and the wicked, Eccles.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If government of others were the Saints right, God would not have made <hi>Saul</hi> King, nor <hi>David</hi> acknowledged him King over <hi>Israel,</hi> nor adjudged him to death that slew him, nor would God have termed <hi>Cyrus his Shepheard, Isa.</hi> 44. 28. <hi>his anointed, Isa.</hi> 45. 1. nor <hi>Daniel</hi> have said to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar Dan.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>thou O King art a King of Kings, for the God of Heaven hath given thee a Kingdom power and strength and glory,</hi> or to <hi>Darius, O King live for ever, Dan.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
               <p n="19">19. If the Saints have regained in Christ the rights and priviledges in respect of Government, then all offices of government, or some only; if all, then every Saint is of right a King, and so a King by inheritance, succession or election, is no more a King than the meanest Saint, yea than a child, if a Saint, and so no <hi>wo when the King is a child</hi> contrary to <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 16. then one person hath no more right to an office than another, which would introduce anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and take away all government, which is indeed the event to which <hi>Fifth-monarchy-mens</hi> principles and actings tend, under shew of the Saints right to put power into the hands of the most violent Spirits, whereby all orderly government will be demolished, and tyranny of a few, with the common robbery of all, promoted. If some only have rights to some offices and priviledges in respect of government, who shall distinguish? how shall the right of each be tried? what Court shall there be to decide controversies of this kind? Is there any that hath discerning of Spirits to find out each ones fitness? Is there any Oracle of God, any Priest by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> who can declare what is to be done? Sure such devices

are not of God, but of Satan, which tend to unsettle things placed in order, and involve men in inextricable difficulties not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided without a miracle.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If the Saints have regained rights and priviledges in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Government in Christ, then are those unjustly debarred from them who are Saints. But the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> in their <hi>Banner of truth displayed</hi> do not only declare the Saints are to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Romish, Universal, national Prelatical, Parochial Presbyterian Churches, but also from the congregational Churches, though <hi>they hope godly,</hi> if they oppose them or concur not with them in their smiting work, though <hi>they be brethren in the Churches,</hi> yet they <hi>accompt him and that spirit which either in act or deed wilfully and obstinately</hi> (as blessed be the Almighty they did both before by the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> own confession and in the year 1660) <hi>denies the smiting work of our Lords Kingdom</hi> (as they pretend it to be, though it be but their own work, and for themselves moved by their own Phrenetick fury or intemperate blind zeal) <hi>Antichristian,</hi> terming them <hi>formally godly,</hi> if they be not as violent as themselves, and degrading them as if they had no sanctity, who are not s<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The sixth position to which all their consultation and doctrine tends, and which is indeed the venom and poyson of all their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents boyled up to the heigth, is, that the <q>Kingdom and power in these Nations is the Saints birthright as freemen of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> and heirs of the whole world with Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>whence 'tis that they say,</hi> 'tis to be desired from good and sound grounds that they would exercise that royal authority which God has given unto them and invested them with as they are Saints by calling, which is to defend themselves and offend their enemies, and to contend against those that do or shall oppose them in their work and businesse, which is to smite powers and to take the Kingdoms of the world into their own possession, the glass of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55931:52"/>
Beasts power being almost run out in these Nations, p. 27. the call which the stone shall have to act in its smiting work, is for the greatest part thereof now pertinent and fitly applicable to a faithful remnant now extant in <hi>England,</hi> and fulfilled in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and also seeing that the signs laid down in the word of God for the time of the end are in a great measure now fulfilled and accomplished in <hi>England's</hi> remnant: therefore we conclude and assert, that 'tis lawful and warrantable, and is a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent for captivated <hi>Sion</hi> and oppressed Saints to stand up in Gods name, and fear, and deliver themselves and that glorious Gospel of the Kingdom now by them declared to the world, from persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, oppression, and that long captivity and bondage, which she hath remained in, and to break the yoke of the Oppressor, which is now upon her neck according to the word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 2. we are perswaded that the work of the stone is the present work of this generation, and our present work, and do accordingly exhort the Saints to arise, to fall upon the enemy, p. 62.</q> Now these positions, conceits, and exhortations are impious and vain. For, 1. it is proved before, that their separation from their brethren, deserting their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to whom they owe subjection, their reviling and speaking evil of powers, their taking up arms against them are not honest and just means. 2. It is not proved that the smiting work <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 35. is that work which they exhort to. 3. Nor is it proved to be the work of Saints as Saints. 4. Nor is there any thing they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, that shews it to be the work of this generation. 5. Nor any thing that shews that it is pertinent and fitly applicable to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remnant now extant in <hi>England.</hi> 6. Nor can any thing be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the <hi>signs laid down in the word of God</hi> (which they only say <hi>are in a great measure fulfilled and accomplished in</hi> England<hi>'s remnant) for the time of the end</hi> to warrant their acting, sith no signs are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for acting against plain precepts without a clear Commission by extraordinary revelation or miraculous power, much lesse when they are not wholly fulfilled, and that accomplishment they are encouraged by is taken either from conjectural calculations of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical numbers, or from the heat of some (perhaps real Saints) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the oratory and confidence of their magnified Teachers and Leaders, opposed by other sober and considerate persons as godly, though not so hot-spirited as themselves, which heat hath cooled much, and many have been withdrawn from them, as themselves complain and experience shews, which also hath proved,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55931:53"/>
that they have much deluded themselves and others who have rested upon their calculation of mystical numbers. 7. Nor is there any thing deprehended in those, whom they call <hi>the faithful remnant in England,</hi> why they should be called to this work rather than others of former time or in other Countries. For though they magnify them that are of their party as <hi>pretious Saints, publick-spirited, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniers, illuminated;</hi> disparaging others as <hi>formal professors, leavers of their first love,</hi> and the like, yet experience hath proved them to be but as other men, or rather many of them to have been worse than others, far from Saints and a faithful remnant, and by their uncharitablenesse, rashnesse, cruelty, contempt of and disobedience to their Governors, to have been more like Divels than Saints. 8. The falling off of many, who perhaps inclined to them and favoured their design, apprehending it to have been at first out of good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and to a good end, but since finding it to have been out of a factious spirit, and tending to blood and rapin, likely to beget (when the rabble of loose persons, agents for <hi>Rome,</hi> and men of desperate fortunes should with a shew of sanctity and zeal for Christ join with them) an horrible wasting and depraedation of mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states (which these men as holy as they would be taken to be, its likely aimed at, when they used those words p. 66. <hi>In such a practise they shall be no losers, Christ will give them an hundred fold, even the spoil of their great and rich enemies, who are his opposers and in the end an eternal Crown)</hi> together with an universal enmity and dreadful anarchy, have deserted them, is a good evidence of the madnesse and impiety of their assertion and exhortation. 9. It is evident, that they have been deluded in their conceits, and their wild positions and attempts by the want of power and authority, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for that work, which they imagined <hi>the faithful remnant in England</hi> called to. For as the Apostle saith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power,</hi> and therefore there being no such power of calling down fire from Heaven, of smiting the earth with plagues, or any other extraordinary power, such as is foretold of the two witnesses <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. or in the Prophets, Judges, or Apostles sent by God, we cannot take their attempts or call to be any other than heady &amp; rash, not from Gods spirit, but fond opinion of the power of their prayers, because of their vehemency (as <hi>Hackets</hi> was in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies) and Satans delusion of them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is a very great delusion they are transported with, which makes them imagin they shall by their arms subdue all the enemies of Christ, make them the footstool of Christ, and take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55931:53"/>
which is made the work of God, <hi>when he sends the rod of his strength, in the day of his power, in the day of his wrath, Psal.</hi> 110. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. which to attempt by themselves is a most monstrous giant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enterprise.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nor is it a small vanity and folly in them to presume to ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Saints exaltation afore Christs appearing, which is to be accomplished at <hi>his coming and in his Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. It shews the want of sobriety in these men, that they abuse holy scriptures and scripture expressions, altogether impertinent to their purpose, for so evil purposes as they alledge them. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in applying those words <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 2. which are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the people of the Jews, and their delivery from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> or some other dispersion proper to them, to the people of <hi>England,</hi> which were never under such cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, making their subjection to civil Rulers <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> and exhorting them <hi>to deliver themselves</hi> by arms in the imitation of them, who delivered themselves from exile by voluntary embracing of the allowance of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and other <hi>Persian</hi> Kings. Their claim also of the <hi>Kingdom and power in these Nations as the Saints birthright as freemen of the Common-wealth of Israel and heirs of the whole world with Christ, Gal.</hi> 3. 29. is alike ridiculous. For they are no otherwise freemen of the Common-wealth of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> than in a Metaphor taking the Church of God for the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, and Church members freemen of the Common-wealth: But this belongs to every Christian, at least who is really such in the whole world, and then if freedom should infer soveraignty, they should be Kings because freemen, which is a meer <hi>non sequitur. Gal.</hi> 3. 29. speaks not of the inheritance of the whole world, but <hi>of the promise,</hi> which is <hi>of the spirit v.</hi> 14. not of the dominion of the whole world.

               <p>IT remains now, that I consider what I meet with in the writings I have seen for the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> separation from, and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting civil powers, and acting in the behalf of the Fifth-Monarchy,

The reasons of their separation and engaging against all civil powers, are in the <hi>Banner of truth displayed.</hi> p. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88. Whereof the first is this, <q>Because the Fifth Kingdom, which is <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ's and the Saints, together with the Lawes and Ordinances thereof, is to take place of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, which is the Kingdom of the Beast and Antichrist (with destruction thereto) together with all the Lawes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances thereof, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. ch. 7. 18. 26, 27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28.</q> Answ: This is granted, and it is in part fulfilled by the setting up of Christs Kingdom by preaching the Gospel, and is yet to be fulfilled at Christs appearing; of the former of which, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. <hi>Isai.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. are meant, of the later, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 18. 26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. None of the texts term civil powers in <hi>England</hi> the Kingdom of the Beast and Antichrist, or the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, nor prove the Fifth Kingdom, is to be set up by sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from civil powers, or engaging against them; which were to be proved, and therefore, if that which is said to be an <hi>undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth among the Saints,</hi> yet sith those Saints are not infallible, and other Saints perhaps doubt of it, as judicious as themselves, it should have been proved, and also their inference thence clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unless they had been resolved to deceive, or remain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>Because the civil power is that which doth oppose the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Kingdom of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, not only deteining his right interest, title and birthright of inheritance from him (as much as in them lies, which is as great an evil as if they should effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accomplish their wicked design) but also do make War against the Lamb Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the Saints his followers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This is a very deep charge, but so confused and in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, that it serves the more fitly to hide the deceit of the accusers, it being true, <hi>Dolus versatur in generalibus,</hi> their's guile in accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are only in Generals tending to make any suspected, or accused, against whom they have a prejudice, and the more defficult for the accused to defend himself. If it be meant of the Popish Prelates and Princes, or Mahometan, or Pagan, it is not denied; if it be meant of the Protestant, civil and Ecclesiastical powers, it should be shewed, which of them, and in what facts they do those things here charged on them. Perhaps they that are accused, are not guilty, or if they be guilty, yet not of such facts as amount to what is here imputed to them. Sure every injurious act to a Saint makes not the power an <hi>enemie to Christ,</hi> nor every unrighteous Law, or Act, which may hinder the progress of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, doth so <hi>oppose the righteous Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as to be construed, not <hi>only the deteining of his right, interest, title and birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of inheritance from him, but also making War against the Lamb Christ Jesus, and the Saints his followers,</hi> much less to be taken for an <hi>opposition to Christs Kingdom, as much as in them lies, and as great an evil, as if they should accomplish their wicked design.</hi> Possibly this opposition, which they accuse powers of, is nothing else, but an opposition to the wild and frantick actings of Fifth-Monarchy Men; which if so, they rather are to be said to further the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdom of Christ, than oppose it, and the Fifth-Monarchy Men be more truly chargeable with the <hi>making War against the Lamb Christ</hi> Jesus, <hi>and the Saints his followers.</hi> Possibly the <hi>Quinto-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchians</hi> do charge powers with these things only, out of uncertain rumors and reports, yea perhaps only out of prejudice, which is too too frequent, though it be but a Divelish practice, in many that are reputed Saints. Surely these consulters in a secret conventicle, where the powers cannot be heard speak for themselves, are not competent accusers to arraign, and Judges too to condemn their superiors, if I may not be allowed to call them their betters. This is indeed an intolerable and damnable presumption both to God and Man. Nor is there any thing in the texts that is for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55931:55"/>
the former, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 14. being meant only of those <hi>Kings who received power as Kings one hour with the Beast, and give their power and strength to the Beast,</hi> which sure cannot be meant of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes, or Prelates, or Powers, it being expresly declared by the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 25, 26, 27. to have been fulfilled in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy of <hi>Herod, and Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles and Princes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> putting Christ to death. The other text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 19. is confessedly meant of Christs enemies that <hi>shall be near the time of the rise of the Kingdom of Christ;</hi> and therefore is madly applied to a duty of Non-assisting, or ressisting present powers. It's against all Rules, but those of frayes, when Tinkers and Pedlers, and the rabble Rout fall to fighting, to strike <hi>Richard</hi> for <hi>Robert,</hi> to oppose the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent powers in this Generation, the civil and Ecclesiastical, because <hi>the Beast and the Kings of the earth, and their Armies shall be gathered together, to make War against him that sate on the Horse, and his Army.</hi> No marvel men that thus argue, should hate Lawyers and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, which would hisse out such Law and Logick; no marvel godly Brethren desert them, when they vent such things, as befit Devils rather than Saints, and better agree with the doctrine of Hell, than of the Church of Christ; to whom that may be applied, which Christ saith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>I know the Blasphemy of them which say they are</hi> Jewes, <hi>and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> As for us who <hi>have not known the depths of Satan as they speak,</hi> we judge we may be <hi>friends and subjects of men,</hi> even such as do <hi>oppose the righteous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jesus Christ;</hi> if we do not concur with them, nor love, nor favour, nor yeild obedience to them in that opposition, we may be subject to them in the things of men, though we oppose them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our duty, as did the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. in the things of God, when they act contrary thereto. Nor need we fear to be charged with <hi>serving Christ and Belial,</hi> or being <hi>found secret,</hi> or open <hi>Traitors to Christ,</hi> while we assist them in matters of civil Government, and good order of Churches, though they be adversaries to some truths we hold, or some practises, which we conceive, and perhaps are, our duty. The power is not <hi>Belial</hi> alwaies, when those that have the power be men of <hi>Belial:</hi> A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving servant may serve with a good conscience an unbelieving Master: enough hath been said of this before.

               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:55931:56"/>
                  <hi>Answ:</hi> It is prophesied of <hi>the Saints of the most High,</hi> that <hi>they shall take the Kingdom, and possess the Kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever;</hi> But it is not said, that the Kingdom they shall take shall be the visible Kingdom on earth, after or towards the time of the end of the fourth, or <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, or that the Saints are the Gentile Saints, or the Gentile Saints of this Age, or this Island, or of the City of <hi>London,</hi> or that they shall take it from the Beast, or that the Beast is the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power of <hi>England,</hi> or that they shall take it by their separation, or smiting work, or that the <hi>Saints</hi> shall <hi>take away the Dominion of the Horn to consume, and to destroy it unto the end,</hi> by some fighting Act of theirs, or any such, as the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> design. But in the reading and meaning of those words, there is so much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and uncertainty, that no sober person would ever have made such an inference as these men make from it. For first, it is not very certain whether the fourth Beast be the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae,</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, though I incline to the later. 2. It is uncertain whether <hi>the little Horn</hi> be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> or the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Papacy, though I incline to the later. 3. Nor is it certain, that it is to be read, <hi>the Saints of the most High shall take the Kingdom</hi> (which I follow with our interpreters, the same persons being to <hi>take the Kingdom</hi> who are <hi>to possess it for ever)</hi> and not, as some read, <hi>they shall take the Kingdom of the Saints of the most High;</hi> meaning, the four Beasts shall take the Kingdom of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> 4. Nor is it certain, that v. 26. when it is said, <hi>they shall take away his Dominion,</hi> is meant of the Saints. For, 1. it may be read, as <hi>Junius</hi> reads it, impersonally <hi>auferetur, it shall be taken away,</hi> not <hi>they shall take away.</hi> 2. Nor is it likely, that this should be attributed to the Gentile, or Jewish Saints. 1. Because it is an act beyond the power of Saints to <hi>take away the Dominion, to consume, and to destroy it to the end,</hi> it being the same with the <hi>slaying of the Beast, the destroying of his body and giving it to the burning flame, v.</hi> 11, which is to be conceived to be done by <hi>the fiery stream, which issued and came forth from before the Ancient of daies, v.</hi> 10. and therefore by the immediate hand of God, or his mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And in all likelihood it is then when <hi>he shall put down all Rule and all Authority and Power,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. which is made the act of God the Father, <hi>v.</hi> 28. 2. This is confirmed, because it is said, <hi>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take his dominion away:</hi> Now the <hi>sitting of the judgment</hi> was, when <hi>the books were opened, the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of daies did sit, v.</hi> 9, 10. which the comparing it with <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12. doth evince to be at the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55931:56"/>
3. This is also further proved, in that <hi>the dominion given to the Son of Man</hi> after the destruction of the fourth Beast is said to be v. 13. 14. <hi>when one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of Heaven, and came to the Ancient of daies, and they brought him near before him:</hi> which is to be understood, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> proves in his <hi>Answer to Mr. Hayne,</hi> (and then the taking away shall be by Christ) of the time, <hi>when he shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8. and shall <hi>consume the wicked one with the spirit of his mouth,</hi> and <hi>shall destroy him with the brightness of his coming,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 8. which is a work beyond the power of Saints with bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weapons, or any might of theirs to effect. 4. Where it is said, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>that the people of the Saints of the most high shall have the Kingdom,</hi> it is said, <hi>it shall be given them,</hi> not, they shall acquire it, or take it by their forcible or any other acting. And therefore it is a most vain conceit, that this thing is to be done by <hi>the Saints en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</hi> or that they are to <hi>fulfil the word of God,</hi> or to imagine, <hi>the word of God could not be fulfilled without them,</hi> or they could be <hi>instrumental in this great work,</hi> or that their <hi>act of separation from ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil powers were necessary to it,</hi> or it or their smiting work <hi>did render them in any measure ready for that which follows.</hi> There are other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties concerning the Saints, whether they be not peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Jewish people, or the Kingdom taken, the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, which the Hebrew Christians received, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. of which I have spoken somwhat before, and now omit that which I have said, being sufficient to shew the futility of this fourth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their fifth Reason is as vain as the former, yet because it is the Engine, whereby perhaps well-meaning and tender conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are frighted or drawn into their way, it is necessary to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. <q>Because, <hi>say they,</hi> there are dreadful judgements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in particular against those that shall be found owning, submitting unto, and supporting of the Civil Power in the daies of the Lords more glorious manifestation of himself, and when he gives notice &amp; warning to all, of those judgments which then he is about to bring upon his enemies, &amp; by his Instrument proclaims the overthrow and down-fall of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. If any man worship the Beast and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, &amp;c. and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, which is the plague and pains of Hell. Now we apprehend that this Scripture will be fulfilled upon those who
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55931:57"/>
shall be found worshippers of the Beast, &amp;c. in the last ages of the world, and not long before our King begin to take the power: For (mark it) upon the rise of the first Beast <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2. with seven heads and ten horns, ten Crowns, &amp;c. all the world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after the Beast, v. 3. or as in v. 8. all that dwell upon the earth, whose names are not written in the Lambs book of life, worship the Dragon and the Beast, v. 4. Hitherto there's no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Image and Mark; but upon the rise of the second beast that comes out of the earth, and has two horns like a Lamb, &amp;c. v. 11. the case is changed and grows more difficult and dangerous, for he doth not only v. 12. cause the earthlings to worship the first beast, but in processe of time (after he hath deceived them by his great wonders and miracles) he makes them that dwell on the earth make an Image to the first Beast, into which he infuses life, and causes all that will not worship that Image to be killed; proceeding further also, he causes all small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and no man is permitted to buy or sell save he that has the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. Now by this time we are come somewhat near the end of his reign and the beginning of Christs Kingdom. Now then we observe from hence, 1. That the image, mark, name, and number of the Beast, are of a later date than the first Beast, and his ten horns, and so consequently men in former ages and generations might have worshipped the beast, and yet not his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, nor receive his mark, &amp;c. 2. By how much the nearer his end is, by so much the more dangerous it is to worship him, &amp;c. 3. That those who in the last daies near unto Christs coming, shall have all these marks, denotations, and characters found upon them (that is to say, those that worship the beasts, and) (mark the emphasis of the words) his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or right hand shall drink the wine of Gods wrath, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone: so that we conceive 'tis the duty of Saints to consider these things, and to separate from the beast, his image, mark, number, &amp;c. and to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, affection, subjection to the beast, and civil power, or any of its appertainers, though they lose their lives for it.</q> And then adds encouragements to adventure the losse of life, rather than incur the danger of Gods wrath, with assurance of glory to such, as in doing that, which they make the Saints duty, lose their lives, which is a device too like that of the Jesuites, when they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55931:57"/>
animate their Assassins to Regicide by promise of absolution, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Martyrdom and Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ,</hi> I should not think it worth while to make any answer to this reason, which proves that which is granted, that <q>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the Beast and his image, the receiving the mark of the beast in his forehead or in his hand, or the name of the beast, or number of his name, or the mark of his name makes men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Gods wrath, <hi>and proves not at all that which is to be proved, that</hi> to have relation, affection, subjection to civil power or any of its appertainers is to worship the Beast and his Image, to receive the mark of the Beast in the forehead or hand, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the mark of his name, his name, or the number of his name,</q> but that I find this is made commonly the pretence of separations of every party, and their oppositions thereupon. Thus not only the Protestants separate from the Papists, counting subjection to the Pope receiving the mark of the beast; but also among Protestants dissenters term the practice they dislike and are averse from, the mark of the beast; whence, especially the common sort, who have most heat and least light, as they are prejudiced, so they inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their opposites as the beast, and the owning them as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiving his mark. So <hi>Brownists</hi> count any acknowledgment of Bishops, receiving ordination from them, using the Cross, Surplice, kneeling and such ceremonies as they injoin, going to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer, paying tythes, being of a national or parish Church, with many more things, which they except against in Prelatical, yea and Presbyterian and congregational government, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping the beast and receiving his mark: which being got once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heads of the common sort, who usually talk much against that which they understand little, inflames them with hatred against those they judge to be the beast, and that which they think is his mark; so as that without measure they inveigh against them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in satyrical scotts and jests put upon them, in tales that disparage them, are averse from any conference with them, or hearing of them speak, and altogether irreconcileable to them. This fashion which heretofore was only used against Ecclesiasticks, the <hi>Fifth-monarchy-men</hi> it seems have here taken up against the civil powers as useful for their demagogical design, to affright the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and to hold them to their party. But to shew the vanity of it, it is to be observed, that they apply the threatnings <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. to the worshipping of the second beast described <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 11. and to the times near unto Christs coming; now that beast by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55931:58"/>
all the descriptions of it appears not to have gotten his power by the sword, as civil powers have, but by deceit, as by pretended mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles v. 13. 14. whence he is termed <hi>the false Prophet, Rev.</hi> 16. 13, 14. <hi>which stirred up the Kings of the earth to make war against the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the white horse, Rev.</hi> 19. 19, 20. <hi>the Whore with whom the Kings of the earth committed sornication, Revel.</hi> 17. 1, 2. which being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed to be <hi>Rome</hi> or at <hi>Rome</hi> v. 18. cannot be applyed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shew or colour to the civil powers of <hi>England,</hi> or other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries besides <hi>Rome,</hi> especially the Protestants, they being no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor using any arts or devices to draw men to the worship of the first beast, or Dragon, or to set up any forreign power, but seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uphold their own civil power, and requiring the subjects to renounce the <hi>Popes</hi> supremacy, and power to depose them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore it is a most impudent false accusation to make the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> civil powers to be either the beast, or the Kings that commit fornication with the Whore, or the having relation, affection, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them and their appertainers the worshiping the beast or his image, or the receiving his mark, name or number of his name. But they say,</p>
               <p n="6">6. <q>We might also further add, because the Civil power is that which enforces and compels the consciences and spirits of men to the Antichristian forms and worship of <hi>Babylon:</hi> accordingly the great Harlot, or Mystery of iniquity <hi>(i. e.</hi> Antichristian worship and Church state) rides upon the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3. that is, she has the preheminence, and makes the Beast use his sword for her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, upon pain of excommunication, curses, and such like baubles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Beast which carrieth the Woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3, 7. is said to have <hi>seven heads and ten horns,</hi> and so is not the <hi>Beast with two horns like a Lamb, Rev.</hi> 13. 11. but the first <hi>Beast, Rev.</hi> 13. 1. of which they say, <q>That the Image, Mark, Name, and Number of the Beast are of a later date than the first Beast and his ten horns, and so consequently men in former generations might have worshiped the Beast, and yet not his Image, nor receive his mark, &amp;c.</q> But if the <hi>Beast might be then worshiped,</hi> then might the Beast be worshiped, when the <hi>Dragon gave him his Seat and Power and great Authority, Rev.</hi> 13. 2. at which time they term the power of <hi>Rome the Ordinance of Hell,</hi> p. 51. And if then the Civil power of <hi>Rome</hi> might be owned as the Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. when they compelled men to worship their Idols; in like manner the Civil powers now should be owned as Gods Ordinance, though they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55931:58"/>
should compell men to the Antichristian forms and worship of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> which though idolatrous are not worse than the Pagan worship, to which the persecuting Emperors did compell the Christians. But however, this Reason may give some colour for separating from those Kings and States which use the <hi>Roman</hi> Inquisition, and force their Subjects to go to the Masse, and to worship the consecrated wafer Cake, which they call <hi>The Hoste,</hi> and the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> and to acknowledge the Pope as <hi>the Head of the Universal Church,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Roman Church as the Mother of all Churches,</hi> which may be truly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Antichristian forms and worship of Babylon, the mystery of iniquity, the Antichristian worship and Church-state:</hi> yet this doth not at all reach the Protestant Kings and Civil powers, who do not <hi>enforce and compell men to these Antichristian forms and worship of Babylon,</hi> nor support <hi>the great Harlot,</hi> nor <hi>let her have the preheminence,</hi> nor <hi>use their sword for her advantage,</hi> nor <hi>regard her Excommunication, Curses, and such like baubles,</hi> but use their power and sword against her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride her Excommunications, Curses, Indulgences, and Threats, and urge their Subjects to disclaim her jurisdiction and worship. If any say that the Civil powers in <hi>England</hi> do compel men to be under Diocesan Bishops and Priests, who have their succession and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be present at the Common Prayer, which is nothing but the Masse translated out of Latine into English, and to be members of a National Church, which is Antichristian; I answer, that neither do the Bishops derive their succession from <hi>Rome,</hi> nor is their consecration as the <hi>Roman,</hi> with any oath to the Pope, though Mr. <hi>Francis Mason</hi> have pleaded against <hi>Champney</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of their succession by the ancient Canons, which the Papists allow; nor are the Ministers ordained by the Bishops, Priests to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sacrifice for the quick and dead, as Popish Priests; nor hath the Common prayer Book, the Sacrifice properly so called, the adoration of the host, invocation of Saints, and other rites which make the Masse abominable, nor is the Church of <hi>England</hi> made national as subject to the Pope or communicating with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the <hi>Trent</hi> doctrine, and therefore are not chargeable with <hi>the Antichristian forms, Church state and worship of Babylon,</hi> nor the civil powers, which require conformity thereto, to be judged to compel mens persons to Antichristianism.</p>

that <q>he did conceive it to be one great article of his and their faith, that the work that God doth call his Children to at this day (and he calls upon them from Heaven to attend to) had been the work of Christs visible Kingdom over the world;</q> which he takes for granted, nor in that do I at present oppose him, though I do not assert such a visible Kingdom, as he believes; nor do I gainsay his distinction. p. 59. <hi>Of two parts of Christs Kingdom, one of the Stone, the other of the Mountain,</hi> used before by Mr. <hi>Mede;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that <hi>in the Kingdom of the Stone, the Saints are imployed in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work for Christ to pluck down all, that</hi> Jesus <hi>Christ when he comes may have his enemies his footstool,</hi> and that <hi>the command is, beat your Plow-shares into Swords, intimating that in the time of this Kingdom, there shall be wonderful use of Swords, Weapons of War.</hi> p. 60. But that which I oppose is his speech. p. 63. <q>And though this Stone, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. fundamentally is Christ himself, yet considered as smiting the great Image, it can be no other but Christ mystical, in his members; and the cutting out of this Stone, cannot be meant as some would have it, of Christs first coming, for these reasons; first because the Kingdom of the Stone, it doth arise in the dayes of the ten Antichristian Kings; And in the dayes of these Kings shall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom. What Kings are these? These Kings are not the Four Monarchies, for the Kingdom of God was not set up in the time of those Monarchies, but in the fourth and last only; and here is spoken of Kings in the plural Number; those Kings therefore, are the ten Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings, which are set forth by ten toes, where the work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the first stroak is struck; and are called the ten Horns in another place; and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Those ten Horns are interpreted ten Kings, and in the time of those Kings the Stone is cut out, they are the ten Antichristian Kings; and if so, the Stone cannot be so early cut out, as the birth of Christ, for that was long before the ten Antichristian Kings had being, or existence in the world, therefore the Kingdom of the stone must be cut out later.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ: These Kings</hi> cannot be meant of any other than <hi>the Kings and Kingdoms, which the Kingdom of the Stone shall break in pieces,</hi> which are. v. 45. <hi>the Iron, the Brass, the Clay, the Silver, and the Gold,</hi> and not the toes only; and therefore must be meant of the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and not only of the ten Antichristian Kings. And <hi>in the days</hi> must be understood Synecdochically one of them, as when <hi>Jephthab</hi> is said, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12. <hi>to be buried in the Cities of Gilead,</hi> that is, in one of them, <hi>Jonah was gon down into the sides of the Ship, Jonah</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55931:59"/>
1. 5. that is, one of the sides; and of which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his <hi>answer to</hi> Mr. <hi>Hayn,</hi> hath given more instances, and proved it to be meant of the last of those Kings, which he determines to be the <hi>Roman,</hi> against Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> holding it to be the Kings of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and that it must needs be referred to Christs incarnation, or preaching, which he shewes in his <hi>exercitation</hi> on <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. to have been by Christ himself signifyed, when he said, <hi>the time is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> that is, the time foretold, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. <hi>And the Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> which <hi>the God of Heaven will set up.</hi> The plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber notes not the ten Horns, for these <hi>Kings</hi> can be meant of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the four Monarchies, or Kings; which are mentioned in the plural Number, not because the Kingdom was set up in all their dayes, but in the dayes of the last, into which the power of the rest came, and by smiting of it they were all broken to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Saith he, <q>Because <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not see the Stone to smite, until such time as he had a view and representation of the great Image in all the parts of it before him: He saw it all come forth and exist in its state, before the Stone smites; therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the cutting out of the Stone, was not until every part of it was come forth, and was in being in the world. But if so be we conceive the cutting out of the Stone to be as high as Christs coming; then was the Stone cut out long before the last part of the great Image (the Iron and the Clay) was in being; and if the Stone was cut out so long before, then did the Stone lye still, and not do its work for many hundred years, for the very first stroke the Stone strikes, is upon the feet of Iron and Clay, which it could not do before they were in being.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ:</hi> If the argument be good from the seeing together of all the parts of the Image to the coexistence of the things represented, then all the four Monarchies should exist together, because they were represented and viewed together, which is absurd. 'Tis true, the Stone was not cut out till all the Monarchies were in being, yet it was cut out afore every state of the last Monarchy was in being. <hi>The Stone</hi> is said <hi>to smite the Image in the feet,</hi> not because it began not to smite till the last state and period of the fourth-Monarchy: But because the former Monarchies were brought under the power of the fourth, and rested upon the fourth as the head and other parts of the body do upon the feet, and so by smiting it, the Whore is cast down. If this reason were good, Christs Kingdom should not begin till every part, or state of the fourth-Monarchy
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55931:60"/>
were existent, and then the Saints should not begin to smite till the existence of the last of the ten Kings, which is unknown to them, and then he could not conclude it must be the work of this generation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, saith he, <q>because <hi>Daniels</hi> smiting stone that he speaks of in the 2. ch. and his Ancient of daies siting, that he speaks of in the 7. ch. they must of necessity be one and the same, they are contemporary, for they do one and the same work; the very work that is done by the one is done by the other. The stone smites the toes of the fourth Monarchy, and <hi>Daniels</hi> Ancient of daies sitting, casts down the Thrones, and Judges and destroys the fourth Beast: here's one and the same work, therefore they are one and the same time, the time of the cutting out of the stone, is the same with the time of the sitting of the Ancient of daies. Now if they are the same in time, the stone cannot be cut out so high as Christs first coming, for the Ancient of daies sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it's clear it is not till the ending time of the fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; then comes the Ancient of daies and sits in judgment, and casts down and destroys the beast, and not before; therefore the cutting out of the stone cannot be the first time, but at the close of the fourth Monarchy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>The casting down of the Thrones</hi> is not the putting down of the Thrones of the ten Kings, but in allusion to the manner of settling or placing seats for the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to sit on, it is said <hi>the Thrones were set</hi> (as it is observed by Mr. <hi>Mede Comment.</hi> on <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 20.) <hi>and the Ancient of daies did sit,</hi> or v. 26. <hi>But the Judgment shall sit,</hi> which is the same with <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>And I saw Thrones and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.</hi> Now the time of the sitting <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. is the time, <hi>when one like the Son of man came with the clouds of Heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him: And there was given him dominion and glory and a Kingdom, that all people, nations and languages should serve him,</hi> which to be referred to the time of Christs second coming when <hi>all rule and authority &amp; power shall be put down, and every knee shall bow to him,</hi> is intimated by our Lord Christ himself allusively to this of <hi>Daniel</hi> expressing his second coming by the <hi>coming in a cloud, Luke</hi> 21. 24. <hi>in the clouds of Heaven Matth.</hi> 26. 64. If then the stone be not cut out till then, it will not be cut out till Christs second coming, and so no smiting work till then, which is absurd and contrary to this Authors own tenet. But neither is it true, that <hi>the Ancient of days sitting, and the stones smiting do one and the same work,</hi> if by the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55931:60"/>
                  <hi>same work</hi> be meant the same numerical action, the Agents being not the same, the sitting is of the Ancient of daies, who is not the same with the stone, but he that cuts out the stone, or the God that sets up the Kingdom: If it be meant of the <hi>same work</hi> that is the same event, fact or accomplishment, then there's no necessity, that they should be contemporary, that is in the same age, as the building of the Temple was the same work, yet not the time of laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and finishing it the same; the raising up the fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was the same work, yet not the several governments of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, and in like manner the demolishing of it is the same work, yet part of it to be done by Christ at his first coming and part at his second, and so the cutting out of the stone may be at his first coming and the sitting of the Ancient of daies at his second, and it's not necessary that <hi>the Fifth-Monarchy should begin at the later end of the Fourth Monarchy,</hi> or the <hi>smiting work be the overturning the Thrones of the Kings to be performed by the Saints as chief instruments in the management thereof,</hi> nor doth it <hi>follow of necessity there must be such a thing, as the civil and military power to be in the hands of the Saints, and that before the day of Christs appearance for the performance of that work,</hi> which is the thing he contends for, and endeavours to prove by these eight reasons. First, <q>Because the work of breaking the great Image is done by the stone cut out of the Mountain; it's not done by mountains considered as mountains, it's not done by Nations considered as Nations, Kingdoms considered as King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: for then it would be done by the Mountain; but it's done by a stone cut out of the mountain, by a people pickt out by God himself out of the Nations and Kingdoms of this world, formed and united together by God himself, which shall fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great Image and break it to pieces; i'ts these that do this work; and further it's cut out without hands, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. 45. that is without worldly powers, but more immediately by God without the hands of men. Its clear it shall be by the Saints as chief, principal and leading instruments, because they are called the stone in relation to the Lord Jesus Christ called a stone, of whose nature and image the Saints are partakers, not so the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between whom and Christ there's no agreement.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This reason proves not the Saints to be meant by the <hi>Stone,</hi> nor that they <hi>are to break the Image,</hi> but the contrary; For they are not <hi>cut out with<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut hands,</hi> but are begotten by men in the ordinary way of generation, nor, if this Authors way should be meant of smiting the Image by civil or military power, should
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55931:61"/>
they break the Image without hands, but with hands: not is there a word in the Text that shews the Saints to be meant by the Stone, much lesse the Saints of the later times of the fourth Monarchy or of this Nation, or that it excludes Kings, who may be Saints and Christs instruments to break the Image, for they may be Saints; and if not, instruments of Christ, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was, to break the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loman</hi> Monarchy, and to restore the Jews, and therefore there is no consequence in this reasoning, which is out of figurative expressions to proper, though the thing be not interpreted so, but only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by this Arguer without any cogent reason: <hi>It's done by a stone cut out of the mountain, therefore by a people pickt out by God out of the Nations,</hi> for neither doth the Text expound <hi>mountain,</hi> by <hi>the Nations and Kingdoms of this world,</hi> nor by <hi>the Stone</hi> a <hi>people pickt out,</hi> but <hi>the stone</hi> may be meant of Christ personal, or his Kingdom, as the text explains it, and he be <hi>cut out,</hi> that is, formed <hi>without hands</hi> in his Mothers womb, as when <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>he was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth, Psal.</hi> 139. 15. and <hi>the Kingdom cut out of the Mountain,</hi> that is, set up among men <hi>without hands by the God of Heaven,</hi> by the preaching of the Gospel and by the power of his spirit, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>The 2. reason from, <hi>Dan,</hi> 7. 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, is the same with the 4. in the <hi>Banner displayed,</hi> and is fully answered before in this section.</p>
               <p>The 3. reason is, <q>That Generation of men shall destroy the Kingdom of the Beast, in the time when his Kingdom is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that did bear witness against the Beast for Christ, all the time his Kingdom stood. This is grounded upon <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. Which tels us that the witnesses for 1260 dayes prophefied, in the end of this time they are kil'd by the Beast, they rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and rising up they knock the Beast down, for immediately thereupon the tenth part of the City fell, and there was a great Earth-quake, &amp; there were slain of men seven thousand, and great fear fell upon all the rest, and they gave glory to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, this is not done by worldly powers, but the witnesses, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that have born witness against the Beast, shall give the deadly blow to the Beast.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If this reason were good, it should be done by the Saints, that have been, not by those that shall be, by them risen again, not to be born hereafter, by them that have born witness all the time the Beasts Kingdom stood, not by them, that only stand up near the time of the end, it shall be done by supernatural, or propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power, not by civil and military, which this author contends
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55931:61"/>
for. In a word, in all this there is nothing but uncertainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these witnesses who they are, whether already existent, or future, the Beast meant, the time of their prophesying, and the event, and the manner and means of its accomplishing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this proof is <hi>ignoti per ignotius,</hi> of a thing unknown by that which is more unknown, which is vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> saith he, <q>The Angel that enlightens the earth with the glory of the truth of the Lord, that is, that Angel, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that shall ruin <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18. 1. But the earth hath not been enlightened with the glory of God, by the generation of the world, but the world hath been enlightened by the generation of the faithful, that God hath revealed his truth to, and this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that enlighteneth the earth with the glory of God, gives the deadly blow unto the Beast, there where light comes forth, God will carry on the work by those hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Angel is <hi>another Angel,</hi> therefore not the generation of the faithful, <hi>coming down from Heaven,</hi> therefore not a man, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great power,</hi> therefore not using humane Weapons, <hi>enlightens the earth with his glory,</hi> it is not said, with the truth or glory of God, nor enlightening men by revealing Gods truth to them, nor that he gives the deadly blow to the Beast, but only that he <hi>cried migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily with a strong voyce, saying, Babylon is fallen,</hi> therefore this proves not, that a company of private Saints in the ending time of the Fourth-Monarchy shall destroy it by a military, or civil power, yea if <hi>where light comes forth, God will carry on the work by those hands,</hi> all the preachers of the truth shall be instrumental to the ruin of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and that by preaching, not a company of private Saints by fighting.</p>
               <p>The fifth reason from <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. is fully answered before, <hi>sect.</hi> 9. The 6. is, <q>The work of God against <hi>Rome,</hi> shall be so mannaged as there may be singing of <hi>Hallelujabs</hi> in the Churches, for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it on: this is clear from <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 1. But now if this should be done only by the clattering of a company of Nations falling upon the Beast, and ruining him, what singing would there be in the Churches for this? What would there be more in this, then in the work of <hi>Cyrus</hi> destroying <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in <hi>Alexanders</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> Monarchy, or in the <hi>Romans</hi> destroying the <hi>Grecians</hi> Monarchy? For that was a part of Gods decree, as well as this, what should the people therefore now sing <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> more for, more than in those times? But because of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the instruments, things done in a more holy sanctified
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55931:62"/>
way to a more pure end; and there shall be more of the Image of God appear upon those that shall do this work now, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shall sing <hi>Hallelujahs;</hi> otherwise, the work did not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the work that had been done before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When the work of destroying <hi>Babylon</hi> was done by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> there was singing of <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> as was foretold, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 51. 1. and that because it was <hi>the work of God,</hi> who ever were the instruments. And indeed that is the reason expresly given, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 1, 2. not this, which is here imagined contrary to the express text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16, 17. yea it is more joyous to the Saints, and more redounds to Gods glory, that he ruines <hi>Babylon,</hi> by those that did support her, as that <hi>by death,</hi> procured by Satan, God <hi>destroyed him that had the power of death.</hi> And this was Gods way in destroying the former Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and therefore is more likely to be his way in destroying this, not a work by other meanes then the former, though exceeding, or going beyond it in the conspicuity of it, and consequents of it, and therefore occasioning more praise to God, and not for the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the instruments, which the text mentions not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> saith he, <q>The Kingdom of the stone, when it comes to smite <hi>Rome,</hi> then shall be in it a resemblance (as it were) of the reign of Christ and the glory of the Kingdom of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, therefore it is said in v. 6. For the Lord God omnipotent raigneth, which could not be said if the work were done by a company of carnal Nations; and yet this is before the end, before Christs coming: for after this appearance, we have the Bride making her self ready, and the Kings of the earth come together to destroy the Bride preparing for her Husband, and then you have Christ coming forth in his fury, destroying his enemies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuing his Bride: But before that day there shall be such a glorious appearance in the world, and such power in the hands of the people of God, that it shall be said when men look upon it, The Lord God omnipotent raigneth, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is King of the world, and King of Saints raigneth; therefore it shall be done by Saints as leading instruments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Such an acclamation is usual upon any glorious work of God, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 18. and in the Psalms often, and therefore it is but a vain conceit, as if that speech could not be used unlesse the Saints were leading instruments. In this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> we have acclamations where no act is expressed of the Saints, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 11. and 5. 9, 10, 12, 13. and 7. 12. and 11. 15, 17. and 12, 10. and 15. 3, 4. and 16. 5, 7. 'Tis granted that before Christs coming
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55931:62"/>
upon the ruin of <hi>Babylon</hi> there will be occasion of the acclamation <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 6. but not because private Saints shall destroy <hi>Babylon</hi> by their smiting work, but because Gods power and might is thereby manifested, and the dominion of God will be thereby promoted.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, saith he, <q>Look through the old and new Testament, where ever we have a description of the persons that shall do the glorious work of God at the last day, and you shall ever find them described and characterized as Saints, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 13 against thy Sons O <hi>Greece,</hi> that is, against the Turkish power. <hi>Obad.</hi> 18. 21. when all his enemies are brought down, and become his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool, then shall he come forth, and take the Kingdom, and the Kingdom shall be the Lords; sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool: then the Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion, rule thou in the midst of thine enemies, there's the coming forth of Christ, when his enemies by his Saints are made his foot-stool. <hi>Micah.</hi> 4. 11, 12. Thou shalt beat in pieces many people.</q> 
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> is his battle ax, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. Psal.</hi> 110. 1, 2. it is not said, <hi>by the Saints Christs enemies are made his foot-stool,</hi> nor <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 20. is meant of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or <hi>the King of Babylon,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Gataker in his Annot. Zech.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Obad.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>Micah.</hi> 4. 11, 12. if meant of a time to come, is to be verified of the Jews and not of Gentile Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. if the same with <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 4. is meant also of the Jews, if of others, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there, nor <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2. is any act ascribed to them, but accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to God for his work: why the seven Angels <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 7. should be any other than holy spirits I see no reason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this reason is impertinent, and none of them prove, that which he undertook.</p>
               <p>To the objection from <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. that <hi>the horns shall do it,</hi> he answers, <hi>the meaning is this, that the ten horns as conquered to the Lamb, and the power of them being gotten into the power of the Lamb, so shall the horns be turned against the Whore, which we cannot see at present.</hi> I reply, this is enough to prove that they be not Saints as Saints that shall burn the Whores flesh with fire, that Saints shall not do it without Kings, and therefore are not to attempt it without them, much less to destroy them, that they are rather to serve them, and to acknowledge what they have done, and may see, though they see not all done they would have done. If for present they see not the <hi>horns ruled by the Lamb</hi> (the seeing of which only prejudice hinders) neither do we see such Saintship in the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55931:63"/>
as by their own rules should qualify them for the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting work, or setting up Christs Kingdom, but rather such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as tends to ruine it.</p>
               <p>To the objection from <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. he saith, <hi>my Kingdom is not of this world, that is, of this Monarchy, all the world being put for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monarchy, Luke</hi> 2. 1. whereto I reply, Christ saith <hi>his Kingdom is not of this world in</hi> opposition to <hi>from above,</hi> as is manifest from <hi>John</hi> 8. 23. and the phrase <hi>not from hence,</hi> and his proof <hi>from his servants not fighting for his rescue,</hi> which is sufficient to shew that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should not be from his Servants, nor by fighting, nor is the particle <hi>now</hi> used to intimate that either his Kingdom should be from hence, or his servants fight, but only is used to declare his present state without intimation of any thing concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>John</hi> 9. 41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He then adds something about the <hi>signs of the nearness of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and omitting <hi>the computation of the time from the numbers left us in Scripture</hi> (which I have considered before sect. 13.) there are ten signs set down of the nearness of it taken from accidents and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of men favourers of his opinion and opponents of it, with his judgment concerning them, and their signification, none of which, but may happen, and have happened concerning other things, which have failed, and been found mistakes in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and being not certain evidences, or prognosticks as miracles, prophesying and such like signs, I therefore let them pass as things either false, and perhaps unrighteous censures, or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and unfit for mine or any mans examination or judgment but Gods only, and contenting my self to have demonstrated that the holy Scriptures yield them no warrant to separate from or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage against the civil powers set over them, I shall commend this work to the Lord for his blessing, praying God to teach those who have been or are led away with the <hi>Quinto-Monarchians</hi> opinion, to <hi>prove all things, and to hold fast that which is good,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
