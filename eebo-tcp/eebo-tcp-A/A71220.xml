            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe World is grown as unconſcionable to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s men of Wit, and Parts, as greedy Houſe-Wives to poor Coſtermongers; though they have never ſo much Traſh for a little Money, they muſt have a Caſt into the Bargain; a Prologue, or a Preface: and they expect Wit in them too, though there is none any

where elſe. This extortion was a while gratified, but the Nine Siſters are ſo beggered with the Maintenance of their Multiplicity of Gallants, that the inſatiable Critick muſt take down-right Railing, for Wit: And I ſhould but imitate my betters, if I rak'd in the honour'd aſhes, and recited the little failings of my ingenious Predeceſſors, thoſe renowned and never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Authors of <hi>Amadis de Gaul, the Knight of the Oracle, Bevis of Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Unfortunate Jack.</hi>—Or I might with others tax the impudence of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary

Hiſtory. His Wife after having brought him one Son, dyed: At the ſame time the Dutcheſs of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> a Young and Beautiful Princeſs, had newly loſt her Husband, though he was already old. His Council thought it very neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhould have more Heirs then one, for his own as well as his peoples Security; and therefore in behalf of all his Subjects, deſired him to chooſe a Wife to his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either in his own, or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Dominions. The Beauty of this Dutcheſs was well known further then <hi>Arragon;</hi> and beſides that in Policy, the occaſion was not to be let ſlip of unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Kingdom ſo conſiderable a Town as <hi>Barcellona;</hi> the Kings own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation made him conceive that Policy the better. Though <hi>Roſalava</hi> had great Beauty, ſhe had yet more Wit than Beauty, ſo that being already abſolute; nothing leſs then a Crown could have tempted her to think of a ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but having an only Daughter as well as he an only Son; She thought this Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now no buſineſs of Importance was done without her Conſent, whoſe Satisfaction was the Kings only care; but this great authority ſhe made uſe of moſt, in that deſign of Marrying her Daughter to the Prince, which ſhe was much more deſirous of, ſince ſhe knew what kind of one he was like to be. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> was born ſo propitiouſly, and with ſo many natural advantages; That being a Kings Son, was the leaſt conſiderable: He had a Beauty which won the Hearts of all that ſaw him, a Wit in his very Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood not to be equalled, and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind that made every body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and fear him: The firſt years of <hi>Alexander</hi> were not more Miraculous than his; and there was not a day in

But ſoon after the Prince of <hi>Tenara</hi> grew ſick of a diſeaſe that in a few dayes ended him, and left his afflicted wife in ſo diſpairing a condition, as made her not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but likely to follow him. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Queens kindneſs, (who began to love her,) all the comfort and aſſiſtance which either her afflictions, or affairs were capable of: The Queen had always liked her, but ſince this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56550:9"/>
Pity increaſing her affection, ſhe loved her tenderly. Fate ſeldom ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing our joyes from us, till we have ſet upon them the higheſt value, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we never prize them enough, till the danger of their being loſt makes us do it too much: She lodged her in her own Palace, and took ſuch care to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, with her that ſhe ſeemed to miſs a part of her ſelf when they were aſunder. However, all this indulgence of the Queens, (enough to have cured her of any other Diſeaſe) only allayed this, by making her bear it with leſs deſpair and impatience: And yet nevertheleſs, her Husbands death, with the ſad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place, was ſo great a blow, and made ſo deep an impreſſion, that all the Queens care and kindneſs was unable to preſerve her from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sickneſs; which proceeded for want of Sleep and Nouriſhment. The Queens trouble was proportionable, who beſides her Grief for the loſs of ſuch a friend, was not a little concern'd to ſee two ſuch fatal accidents happen in her Dominions, to a Family newly come to dwell there. Phyſitians were conjured
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56550:9"/>
to uſe their utmoſt endeavours; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did ſo, her Diſeaſe was too ſtrong for their ſtrongeſt Remedies; and therefore her own Judgment as well as theirs, giving the fatal warning, ſhe reſolved to quit the World with as much tranquility, as that dear pledge ſhe left in it would allow her, which ſure could not be great, when ſhe reflected upon the age and place ſhe left her in; An Infant in a ſtrangers Country: While <hi>Camilla's</hi> thoughts were thus ſadly imployed, the Queen once asking her how ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did? She gently look't up upon her, and taking her by the hand, kiſſed it ſeveral times before ſhe was able to ſpeak a word; but at laſt told her ſhe was very ſenſible of the obligations ſhe had to ſo indulgent a Queen that ſince ſhe enquired of her health ſo kindly, ſhe would preſume to tell her, that though ſhe knew death ſo near, it was not her greateſt apprehenſion, and that her Daughters helpleſs condition was the reaſon why ſhe could not but leave the World uncomfortably; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beg'd leave to manage to the beſt her few remaining hours, by eaſing her ſelf of a heavy burden, and powring out or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56550:10"/>
her own breaſt into the Queens her dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt tender thoughts: She told her ſhe ſhould thank Heaven for giving her leave ſo ſoon to follow the Prince her Husband, if ſhe were only ſure the preſent ſhe now made her would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; a preſent of all ſhe held dear and precious in the World: Then having dryed her eyes of tears which thoſe laſt words had drawn from her, ſhe went on to aſſure her that amongſt all her miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhe could ſcarce think Fortune her enemy, that had brought her to the honour of ſuch a Friendſhip, by a journey which ſhe ſhould think proſperous, were it not for her Lords death, though it proved her own too, ſince her kindneſs, was a Jewel ſhe could not pay too dear for, and the only thing in the World ſhe valued: But was more comforted with the hopes of her Daughters ſucceeding her in that, then in all the Fortunes ſhe left her; and therefore conjured her to look upon her always as the dying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of one ſhe eſteem'd, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to prove a Mother to the Daughter of a friend, whom ſhe ſhould think in that better provided for, then in the two
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56550:10"/>
Principalities ſhe was Heir to. And then her death would not be unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſince not unhappy; for <hi>Zelinda,</hi> who by this change would have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of being Bred by a Queen every way ſo extraordinary: Having ſaid this, ſhe took from under her Pillow a little Box of Jewels, which for her Daughters ſake ſhe had always taken care of, and accordingly now put into the Queens hands. <hi>Camilla's</hi> afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the manner ſhe expreſſed it in, were both ſo moving, that the Queen had not been able to refuſe her requeſt, though ſure of its fatal conſequence. She threw her Arms about her, and aſſured her ſhe received her preſent with joy, and upon condition ſhe ſhould never revoke it, which ſhe hoped her recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would give her leiſure, though not unkindneſs to do: That from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe reckoned her ſelf to have two Daughters, between whom ſhe ſhould no more diſtinguiſh than Twins, of which ſhe did not diſpair to have her a Witneſs: This cured <hi>Camilla's</hi> mind, though not her body, and made her life eaſier, though not longer; for two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56550:11"/>
days after ſhe left the World with that Cheerfulneſs which the Queens promiſes gave her; and the Queen capable of no comfort but the hopes of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Thus we ſee <hi>Zelinda</hi> in leſs then three Months become a perfect Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, by burying both her Parents in their Graves, whoſe Inheritance they came to enjoy; We ſee her but ſix years old, in a ſtrange Countrey, a thouſand Miles from her own; and what is yet worſe in the abſolute power of one who was in time to prove her greateſt enemy, and the cauſe of all her Miſeries. But none are ſo ſafe as thoſe in the hands of Fortune, who never fails ſuch as relie upon her either by choice or neceſſity: She took into her charge this diſtreſſed Orphan, and ſo ordered this diſaſtrous beginning, as to make it a means of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her in the Throne of two mighty Kingdoms. <hi>Zelinda</hi> was the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature Heaven ever made; her Perſon was as miraculous as her life, and this Story, though very natural in every other part, is incredible where it ſpeaks of her. Since the Sun went round the World he never ſaw ſo exact a Beauty, and in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56550:11"/>
this Beautiful body, there was a Wit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the imagination of ours, and ſuch a one as no other body but hers had been worthy of: In the age when others ſcarce ſpake Words, ſhe ſpoke Senſe, and ſuch as might have become any mouth. At her Birth all the Stars were agreed to contribute their beſt influences; And ſhe appeared ſo Divine a thing, as one could not but imagine her fallen from Heaven by a Miracle: She was ſo natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to Good, that doing it, in her was ſcarce a Virtue; and it was not in her power, at leaſt not without great ſelf-denyal, to avoid the practice of all things commendable; If we could look into the minds of the moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, we ſhould not find them ſo fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as their lives; and though their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at laſt gets the better, 'tis a victory like thoſe in Civil Wars by which they muſt needs ſuffer, ſince their Reſolutions are no more their own, then the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that oppoſed them. But in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature, Vertue reigned by Birth, and not by Conqueſt; and therefore ſhe could never fail of doing well, while ſhe did what ſhe liked beſt: Beſides theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56550:12"/>
perfections which are to be deſcribed, thoſe Names, Charms, and Secret graces, which make us love ſo often we know not why, <hi>Zelinda</hi> poſſeſt in ſuch abundance; that ſhe was the general inclination of every man and woman. All her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo agreeable, that no others Beauty was half ſo Charming, and in her gentle Voice there was ſomthing like Enchantment. Perhaps this is not all that might be, but 'tis certain, all ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved cannot be expreſt, and it will be eaſily much imagined that where there was ſo much, there muſt be a great deal more. And ſince, Madam, by this Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe appears ſo very like you, I had as good confeſs ingenuouſly, that in the ſtory there were ſo many remarkable things of her, that though I minded it extreamly, I could never have drawn ſo good a Picture if you had not ſat before me. Theſe were the Arms with which <hi>Zelinda</hi> was to be victorious, and there needed no other, ſince they were enough to Conquer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> who would eaſily conquer the reſt: She was received into Court with ſo general a joy, that it ſeemed an Omen of her future Greatneſs there, of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56550:12"/>
which ſhe then took poſſeſſion. The Queen who thought her ſelf uncapable of any comfort ſince her Mothers death, found the contrary whenever ſhe was with her, and the Kings affections ſcarce knew a difference between her and his only Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcidalis</hi> and <hi>Zelinda,</hi> were of that Age in which Painters repreſent Cupids, and had all the agreeable Beauties, the greateſt Maſters in that Art could give them; Their Charms were ſo equally taking, though extreamly different, and their very childhood was ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that none ſaw them without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them Born for one another, and each had been an unparallel'd wonder of the World, if it had not ſeen them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Indeed though they had the hearts of all that ſaw them, they could never have been loved equally to their Merit by any but themſelves; no Souls but their own being capable of a Paſſion great enough to deſerve theirs. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the God of love, intending to make his power remarkable by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in perſons ſo extraordinary, ſettled it in their hearts ſo very early, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56550:13"/>
they felt it long before they knew it, and were not ſuffered to paſs in quiet that firſt part of life, which Nature ſeems to allow undiſturbed by Paſſions: Thus the firſt ſight of <hi>Zelinda</hi> wrought the ſame effect upon <hi>Alcidalis</hi> which it was wont to do upon others, and he made ſome impreſſion upon the heart of <hi>Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> which ſhe had never felt before. The Queen in purſuance of her great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, had bred up this Prince with all the artifice imaginable, that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to love her Daughter. His firſt pratling was taken advantage of, that he might be uſed to call her his Miſtris: he was dayly brought to ſee her, and thoſe about him ſtill took all occaſions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend before him either her Face or Faſhion. But his inclinations were not the ſame with the Queens, he that had Softneſs and Complaiſance for all the World, ſeemed to want it only for her Daughter, and was no where ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained as in her company: Whether his high Spirit diſdained to be thus given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without his own conſent, or that his Stars, which brought him into the World, for <hi>Zelinda</hi> gave him a natural
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56550:13"/>
averſion to whoſoever would uſurp that place they had deſigned her. But from the firſt moment ſhe came to Court, and was by the Queen made her Daughters Companion, his mind appeared imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately changed, he was perpetually in the Dutcheſs's apartment, and no where ſo well pleaſed as there. Love to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce himſelf eaſily into our ſouls, at firſt comes alwayes accompanied with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Beauty; and makes no ſhew of violence or Cruelty, till he knows himſelf Maſter of the place, and too ſtrongly fixed to fear being diſpoſſeſt. At firſt theſe young lovers felt his power in nothing, but an extream pleaſure in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and then ſuch a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mixt with joy, ſpred it ſelf about their Countenance, that it was very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible their love made them appear more lovely. <hi>Zelinda</hi> had ſtill then been like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of her age, but now began to be more lively; and <hi>Alcidalis</hi> when he ſaw her, was ſo gay and agreeable, that it look't as if he had reſerved for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſome particular Grace, and the beſt of his humour. In that innocent age they enjoyed a pleaſant tranquillity of mind
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56550:14"/>
for ſome Months, in which they were much happier, then in many more that followed.</p>
            <p>But their paſſions increaſed daily with their underſtandings, and Love became ſo powerful, that he quickly made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be both felt and underſtood; <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> now grew more thoughtful then ordinary, and when <hi>Zelinda</hi> was abſent, with an unuſual ſadneſs paid dear for the pleaſure of having ſeen her, there was no ſport for him in any diverſions, but thoſe he took with her, for ſeeing her was his only pleaſure; or if any thing elſe was not indifferent to him, it was talking himſelf, and hearing others talk of her. That heart which even from his Childhood was ſet upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the World, now hath no hopes nor thoughts but of gaining <hi>Zelinda;</hi> or if ſometimes thoſe of his former am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition return, it is but with deſign of rendring himſelf more worthy of her, by laying at her feet as many Crowns as ſhe deſerved. When ever ſhe quitted the room, he was as if fallen from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and next to her company he loved none beſt. When alone (which for her
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56550:14"/>
ſake he was often) he was perpetually reflecting upon all her words and actions; and having conſidered them the ſeveral wayes, they were capable of being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, drew from them accordingly either hopes or fears; then remembring his own expreſſions of kindneſs, was never ſatisfied with himſelf; ſometimes he thought he was too timerous, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too bold, and remained alwayes at laſt as much diſpleaſed with himſelf, as pleaſed with her: He begun by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to give over all thoſe recreations he was wont to be fond of, Hunting, which he loved beſt, became a dull thing to him when ſhe was not there, and if he ſtill minded his Exerciſes, it was but to appear more agreeable to her: In a word, he conſidered <hi>Zelinda</hi> as if there had been no Body in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>Love on the other ſide had got into the heart of <hi>Zelinda,</hi> but had not made ſo great a progreſs; whether it were that fearing her high ſpirit, he durſt not make himſelf known to her at firſt, or that ſhe being the younger by two years, was leſs ſenſible of that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56550:15"/>
paſſion: Yet ſhe was not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, for when ever ſhe ſaw the young Prince, ſhe had more care of her beauty and dreſs than ordinary; ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Counteſs the leſs, becauſe ſhe was deſigned for him, and every little reſpect that out of decencie he paid her, took ſomewhat from the ſatisfaction of the fair <hi>Zelinda.</hi> Yet as ſhe had a Soul, generous, reſolute, and infinitely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by conſequence capable of none but paſſions of the ſame nature, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> formed in it an affection as fair and perfect as it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Love between Perſons of ſo eminent quality (like fire upon a Beacon) is ſo impoſſible to be concealed, that it is ſeen a great way off. The affections of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> and <hi>Zelinda</hi> was ſoon obſerved by all the World, and a great many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they were in Love one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before they diſcover'd it themſelves. In the beginning when Childiſhneſs made their actions leſs obſervable, though they ſaw one another with great joy, no body thought there was any other Love between them, then that of the innocent diverſions they took together.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56550:15"/>
But as by degrees <hi>Zelinda</hi> grew more ſerious, and <hi>Alcidalis</hi> began to ſhew himſelf maſter of a judgment fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Fathers Kingdom, and a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage capable of conquering any other. There was ſcarce any body in the whole Court, but judged their Souls to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſo ſtrong a paſſion, that it would be almoſt an equal difficulty to part'em from their bodies, or from each other. The Queen who was politick beyond her Sex, and deſigned nothing ſo much as marrying her Daughter to <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> was the earlyeſt jealous of <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s beauty, and conſequently the firſt that took notice of this amour; But having a great confidence in her Intereſt, and more in her ſelf, ſhe thought they at laſt would be the only Sufferers, and feared no ſtubborn reſiſtance from minds ſo tender.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the beauty of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> increaſed daily; and though it dawned but a while ago, now ſhone with ſuch light and luſtre, that ſhe ſeemed to proclaim open War againſt the Queen, and all her deſigns. On the other ſide the young Prince ſenſible of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56550:16"/>
his birth and parts, began to be weary of living under the ſlavery of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the conduct of a Woman. That heart great and Royal by Nature, when filled with Love, diſdained any other Empire but <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s; He began to carry his inclinations for her a little more openly, and favoured none but ſuch as ſhe recommended: He run at the Ring only in her colours, all his motto's ſpoke of her, and he was ſo proud of her Chains, that he hated all the World ſhould not ſee them; There were none who in their hearts did not favour their affection. The Queen ſoon began to fear ſhe had dallyed too long with a flame ſo fatal to all her purpoſes, &amp; which now required her utmoſt care and endeavours to extinguiſh it: Yet ſhe reſolved to trie violent remedies at laſt; and ſtrove by all fair means to win upon the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Alcidales,</hi> which ſhe perceived to grow leſs tractable to her every day than other: She uſed all the Arts ſhe could to Eclipſe the beauties of <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and to advance thoſe of her own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom ſhe daily inſtructed, both what to ſay and do, never ſuffering her
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56550:16"/>
to appear but with pompe and luſter But <hi>Zelinda</hi> truſting ſtill to Nature, whom ſhe had been ſo much obliged to already, neglected by her ſelf, was more admired by others, and without any Pearl but thoſe of her teeth, or any Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies but thoſe of her lips, and ſuch other Jewels as a waiting Woman Muſe, dreſſes a Poetical Miſtreſs in, out-ſhone the other, though adorned with all the glories of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> ſo much the wealth that Heaven beſtows, Ecclipſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Earth can lend her Favourites.</p>
            <p>The Queen ſeeing the danger of their continuing any longer in the ſame place, and diſpairing of all other wayes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt their increaſing affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to trye if abſence (though it be the greateſt torment of a ſettled) might not prove the cure of a growing incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And to that purpoſe, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome indiſpoſition, deſires leave of the King her Husband to paſs two or three Months in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and having gained his conſent, ſhe commanded all things to be in readineſs for her journey, and ſaid, ſhe would have none attend her but the Ladies. This news extreamly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56550:17"/>
ſurpriſed our Lovers, who had never felt the ſting, and been only acquainted with the ſweets of Love, and except ſome few apprehenſions for the future; which makes but ſlight impreſſions in minds ſo young, and full of confidence, their joy had been without trouble, and their inclination without the leaſt check. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> was moſt concerned, or at leaſt could worſt diſſemble; there was nothing he would not have attempted to divert this journey, &amp; a thouſand extravigances paſt through his imagination about it, but ſeeing the time drawn on, and the Queens reſolution invincible, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, at leaſt not to let <hi>Zelinda</hi> part without a full and open declaration of his paſſion for her, which till then, (though all his actions continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to her) his words had never preſumed to offer the leaſt hint of: Whether it were that he wanted confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, or thought it needleſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a paſſion that none could ever hide. The laſt night being come, he went on the Queens ſide; where, after ſome time, he found an opportunity of entertaining <hi>Zelinda</hi> alone, it was the firſt minute
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56550:17"/>
that ever <hi>Alcidales</hi> knew what fear was. He attempted once or twice to diſcover his paſſion; but having not reſolution enough to go on, was fain to turn his diſcourſe to ſomething elſe, and though at other times he was the gayeſt Man in the World, near <hi>Zelinda</hi> he was then the moſt perplext. But at laſt his heart beating, and his colour perpetually changing, he with a confuſed and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voyce, ſaid: <hi>I do not doubt</hi> Ze-Linda; <hi>But that you know I love you but; how well, after I have ſaid all I can, muſt ſtill be left to your imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I tell you this, that if you find me kill'd by your abſence, you may know the nature of your loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though your Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be compos'd but of a few dayes to the reſt of the World; they will to me ſeem many Years, and may perhaps out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt me. If you conſider me and your ſelf, you will find the one too Charming to give a moderate affection, and the other incapable of a weak impreſſion: From the firſt moment I ſaw you, my paſſion was at the ſame height, that time, or favours ever advanc't any other to: And ſince every Look, every Word, every</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56550:18"/>
               <hi>Motion of yours has added ſomewhat to it; whilſt I was a Child, I cou'd not expreſs it to you; and ſince I never durſt; and now I tremble only in ſaying, I adore you; and if I read not ſuddenly, ſomething favourable in your eyes for me, I ſhall ſoon want the power to let you know the greater part of that I have to ſay.</hi> At thoſe words, ſhe who had till then kept her eyes upon the ground, look't gently up at him; <hi>Alcidalis</hi> ſeem'd to have received a new life, and thus continued. <hi>Though inclination be but a blind guide; I muſt needs confeſs my ſelf infinitely fortunate, in that which led me to adore the incomparable</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda; <hi>in whom I hourly diſcover ſuch eminent perfections, as may change even an Averſion to its contrary: Judge then what a paſſion I muſt have conceived for her, ſince it was ſo advantagiouſly born, and has been ſo continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd: I confeſs freely, Humility is a vertue that you alone have made me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, I ever thought the whole world too narrow for me; but now I think my ſelf, and that world infinitely below you; I know the laſt</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56550:18"/>
               <hi>thing that you conſider in me, is my Quality; If I poſſeſs any thing worthy of you, 'tis my heart, which I offer to you; and which I can ſay with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to be Great and Generous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to merit a place in yours. I would not praiſe it thus, were it any longer my own: But now I think ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly of it, as I muſt ever do of all things that belong to you. It never had but two deſignes, whereof the firſt, and that which entertained its Childhood, was the Conqueſt of the World: But ſince it has been more aſpiring, and more reaſonable, it has deſired</hi> Zelinda. Here he ſtopt, and waited for her anſwer, who in the condition ſhe was in, had much a do to get out theſe few words. <hi>Sir, I am ſo aſtoniſht at a diſeourſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from you; and to find the eyes of the whole Court upon us, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you will give till my return to make you an anſwer: Which I beg of you to believe, I wiſh may he very ſudden:</hi> Every body obſerved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary between them, but the Queen eſpecially, whom their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation

One day above the reſt, as ſhe was walking with the Queen in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream thick Wood, ſhe ſlipt from the company, attended only with one Maid, 'twas no ſmall eaſe to her to have the liberty of venting her Grief; which at other times ſhe almoſt dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by diſſembling, and reflecting on various Accidents of her life, what ſhe had already ſuffered, and what ſhe was hourly threatned with: Her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly poſſeſt her ſo entirely, that without thinking of the way ſhe found her ſelf by the Banks of <hi>Hebroes:</hi> The Charms of ſo delightful a place, the ſweetneſs of the Air, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe took in being alone, invited her to continue her walk; but fearing the Queen might wonder at her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſhe ſtopt when the noiſe of a Horne, which ſeemed not to be far off, made her turn her head towards a Neighbouring Mountain, where ſhe ſaw as ſhe thought, two men clos'd, and falling together from a Rock; but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56550:21"/>
upon a ſecond view, ſhe found it was a Bear and a man; when immediatly on the place from whence the other fell, ſhe ſaw a young man very well Horſt, leap down after them, the ſtrength of the Horſe, the addreſs of the Horſeman, or the Fortune of both, was ſuch, that they took no hurt; he immediately kills the Bear at one ſtroak, with his Javelin, and ſaves his friend. This generous Action ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Zelinda,</hi> that ſhe was almoſt angry that any but <hi>Alcidalis</hi> had done it: But he that was on Horſeback came towards her, and paſt the River in a place where it was Fordable.

ſome diſorder, ſaid; <hi>Madam, you are not to wonder at any confidence, from a man that is already guilty of that, of having declared he loves you; your laſt words gave me an impatiency, that turned every hour of your abſence into an Age, and I had been unworthy of your return or anſwer, had I been able longer to expect either: What I ſaid then, was but what I muſt always think, and if it were ever Criminal, am come to tell you, I am ſtill Impenitent. Sir ſaid ſhe, if you will give me the leiſure to make you the anſwer I promiſed you, when I left</hi> Saragoſa: Then (finding her ſelf Bluſh, and that he perceived it) ſhe went on thus: <hi>This Colour that riſes in my Face, proceeds rather from that I am going to ſay ſomewhat I never did before, then from a thought that I do therein any thing againſt my honour, I know not whether it be always a ſhame for a Maid to owne ſhe loves, but if ever it were excuſable, ſure it is in me. I will not ſay that my Stars, or your eminent Qualities forc't me to it; thoſe are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences that any one may uſe; I will only urge ſuch as are more peculiar to my</hi>

               <hi>caſe. I lov'd you</hi> Alcidalis <hi>before I knew it was a fault, and conceived an affection for you before I was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, of thoſe Laws that forhid it to our Sex. None can blame me for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entrance to a Paſſion, which I ſeem'd rather to have found there, then received into my heart, and which has been ſo long here; that I can no more remember its Birth more then my own. The firſt inclination I ever had, was for you, and ſelf love ſo early, and ſo natural in all the world, came to me later, then my friendſhip for</hi> Alcidalis: <hi>My Reaſon (which appeared not in a great while after) found it ſo well ſettled that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt lookt like rebellion to attempt any thing againſt it; beſides it ſeemed ſo innocent, and ſo juſt, that ſhe rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtrengthen, then oppoſe it, I ſay all this to excuſe it both to you and myſelf, and to make you know that the ſoul the freeſt from weakneſs, and moſt reaſonable in the World, might have been ſurpris'd, as mine was: If you are pleaſed that I love you, thank not me, but Heaven that would have it ſo. If</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56550:23"/>
               <hi>you are at all obliged to me, it is only for owning of it to you: Thus, though I had not the power of extinguiſhing my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I had certainly that of concealing it, I could have diſſembled it all my life time, or as moſt of our Sex do, have ſhowne it you by little, and little; after having made you long deſire it; were it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable or unworthy either of you or me: It would never he time to diſcover it; but one the contrary, if it be only ſuch as</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda <hi>ought to have for</hi> Alcidalis. <hi>Why ſhould I not from this Minute, give him the joy of knowing, and being aſſured of it. I tell you then I love you</hi> Alcidalis. <hi>and though I ſay it with Bluſhes, I do it without ſhame, I accept that heart which you gave me; which I eſteem a Treaſure far beyond the Crown you promiſed with it, I am pleaſed, to find all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your mind truly Royal; but I could wiſh your Birth were leſs ſo; for I fear Fortune to take that Crown away, which is the thing I leaſt eſteem in you, will rob me one day of all the reſt. I ſee from this hour all the Misfortunes that threaten me, I know your love will cauſe the hatred of the Queen, but ſhe that</hi>

               <hi>hath to her own the heart of</hi> Alcidalis <hi>can fear nothing: I will reſiſt all with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that ſhall amaze you; and ſince Heaven decreed I ſhould have affection, I will accompany it with ſuch a Vertuous Conſtancy, that what is ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procht in my Sex, ſhall be in me eſteemed, and wondred at. Alcidalis</hi> from the very firſt Minut ſhe began, had ſtill hearkened to her as one whoſe fate depended on her Diſcourſe, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it much more to his advantage then he durſt have hoped, was ſo far from being able to expreſs his joy, that he even wanted words for an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment: But after a while coming to himſelf, &amp; finding her that followed out of ſight, he put one knee on the ground; but as he began to ſpeak, the Queen appeared near; the thickneſs of the buſhes having hid her approach, ſo that he aroſe again as ſoon as poſſible. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> was extreamly troubled to be ſo unluckily ſurpriſed: And ſaid, <hi>Sir, you will I fear have cauſe to repent this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary humility. Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I do already, but 'tis only that 'twas no earlier adreſt:</hi> Whilſt they were talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56550:24"/>
the Queen advanc't, and <hi>Alcidalis</hi> coming up to her, ſhe received him with a Countenance ſo gay, and full of ſatisfaction, that <hi>Zelinda</hi> her ſelf could do no more. After the firſt Complements were over, the Prince having told her how the Chace bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him within ſeven or eight Leagues, he thought himſelf obliged to kiſs her hands; the Queen ſeemed to thank Fortune, for having conducted him ſo near her. <hi>But Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I believe you are already paid for all the trouble you have given yourſelf, for its to be imagined the favour that</hi> Zelinda <hi>granted you juſt now, was not inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Since you thanked her upon your Knees for it, as we ſaw; truly it made me not know you at firſt, and I thought it had been ſome of your Servants, but I am very glad it was none but yourſelf who received that ſatisfaction: Pray let us know what it was, that we may partake in your Good-Fortune, and thank her with you. Zelinda</hi> did not grow red upon this, becauſe ſhe had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo, ſince her diſcourſe with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidalis,</hi> and fearing what the Queen
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56550:24"/>
ſaid, might ſurprize him; womens Wits being ever readieſt on ſuch occaſions; ſhe anſwered and ſaid. <hi>Madam, I was asking</hi> Alcidalis <hi>ſome News of</hi> Saracoſa, <hi>he (who without doubt, was thinking of his Hunting) did not anſwer me, I then reproacing him with his heedleſſeneſs and Silence, he kneel'd to me of a ſuddain, and thought by other exceſs of Civility to repair the neglect he had ſhew'd in not replying ſooner to what I ſaid. 'Twas very civil in him,</hi> ſaid the Queen, <hi>and becauſe you believe the Prince is think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Hunting ſtill, you have taken care to anſwer for him. Zelinda</hi> ſeeing the Queen preſs her ſo hard quitted the Diſcourſe. But <hi>Alcidalis</hi> perceiving the pain ſhe was in, came to her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as ſhe had done before to his, and began a relation of ſome little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, the King had ſuffered in her abſence, ſo that the Diſcourſe was quite changed. The good humour <hi>Zelinda</hi> had put him into, made him entertain the Queen with infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance, and addreſs himſelf more then formerly to her Daughter. But our young Lovers were not cunning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56550:25"/>
to deceive her; ſhe perceived the alteration and concluded the gayety of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and the reſpect he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Daughter with, to be but effects of ſome obliging aſſurance he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and from that moment took the reſolution of parting them. The Prince went the next day to <hi>Saraguſa,</hi> whether the Queen was forced to return eight dayes after, this abſence was much more ſupportable to him then the other, for he had in it the comfort of knowing he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the perſon in the World he moſt eſteem'd, they paſt ſome Months ſo well, and with ſuch Tranquility, that <hi>Alcidalis</hi> could almoſt have forgot there was a happineſs beyond it.</p>
            <p>But there is a fatal point which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ever paſs, and fortune is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as weary of the joyes of Lovers, as of the weight of Empires, the higheſt happineſs has this fault that its then neareſt its end. This was ſure the only cauſe of all the misfortunes that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted ſo innocent an affection: The aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that <hi>Alcidalis</hi> had of <hi>Zelindas</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, made him live with more diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56550:25"/>
&amp; more fear of diſpleaſing the Queen, then ever he waited on her Daughter oftner, &amp; converſt leſs with <hi>Zelinda,</hi> ſhe who from her Childhood had been ever ſerious, began to be more and more ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſee and ſpeak to the Prince with great Caution and reſpect, and do all things that might make their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections leſs ſuſpected; but this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as it did ever between Lovers, come too late, the Queen who could not be deceived, with much care, ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and diligence, gave order for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting a deſigne which ſhe had in hand, as thoſe which are in a place with their enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſecretly undermine, for the moſt part fear leaſt of all the ruine they muſt ſink into, and live in ſecurity whilſt men dig Graves under their feet; ſo our Lovers not imagining what was contriving againſt them, enjoyed a perfect Tranquility, and if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended any miſchief from the Queen, they neither apprehended it ſo great, ſo ſuddain, nor in that dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was to befall them. Four Months after the Queen came back from <hi>Catalonia,</hi> ſhe took an occaſion to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56550:26"/>
in the beginning of the Spring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, giving no notice of any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, till the day before. <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> and <hi>Zelinda</hi> were ſo ſurpriſed, that they had ſcarce leaſure to take leave one of the other, as the Prince was expreſſing to her, the Grief he left her with. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Remember you promiſed me, never to complain or fear the combination of the whole World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, whilſt I was for you: Minds aſſured one of another, like Martyrs in the midſt of all their Sufferings, have ſtill their thoughts fixt together with joy, on their reward to come, we ſhall meet again, and even in abſence, our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhall make our paſt Satisfactions ever preſent to us, and our imagination ſhall entertain us with thoſe to come:</hi> At that word ſhe took a Ring from her fair hand; <hi>and bad him keep it with her heart. Alcidalis</hi> received it with all the joy his own was capable of, and was almoſt in love with the ſad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that drew ſo obliging a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from her; then taking another of the ſame ineſtimable value, ſince it came from him, he gave it her with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56550:26"/>
the ſame words, at which they parted with as much Grief as ever they had met with Joy: Tears ſtole down both their Faces, which both ſtrove to hid from each other, as aſhamed of ſuch a vulgar mark of Sorrow in ſo Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant a concern. The Queen went away next Morning, and ſtaying but one day at her own houſe, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have received ſome News from <hi>Barcellona,</hi> which obliged her to go thither, leaving her Daughter with a great part of her Train: She took only <hi>Zelinda</hi> with her, who imagined there was ſomewhat extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in it; but was not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the reaſon; ſo that knowing not what to fear, ſhe feared every thing: The Queen ſpent the remainder of that day in ſeeing the Town, and the magnificent reception that was made for her; the next morning ſhe was told that a Veſſel bearing her own Name, which ſhe had built not long ago, was newly come into the Port, there was then an hundred Veſſels in the Port of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> which ſo ſoon as the Queen appeared, ſaluted her
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56550:27"/>
with all the Guns, ſo that for a while there was nothing to be ſeen but Fire and Smoak, the Ships being hid with a Cloud of their own making, they ſoon made themſelves heard in a ſound of Trumpets and Howboys: The Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and all the Naval Pompe, together with the ſight of that Element, which at firſt ſeiſes the Eyes and Minds of all the World with Admiration, could not in the leaſt divert <hi>Zelinda;</hi> her, heart preſaged thoſe ills at hand, ſhe had ſo long foreſeen. The Queen put her ſelf into a Boat, to go and ſee this Veſſel, and took <hi>Zelinda</hi> with her and ſome few Servants; She found in the Veſſel, the Captain and his Wife, with whom ſhe ſhut her ſelf up a while, which extreamly increaſt the jealouſies of <hi>Zelinda,</hi> ſhe lookt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Spain</hi> with Tears in her Eyes, and began to deſpair of ſeeing it again: An hour after, the Captain and his Wife came out of the Cabine, and told <hi>Zelinda,</hi> the Queen expected her there, her Blood ſtraight Froze in her Veins, and ſhe grew ſo Pale, that ſhe ſeemed rather her own Ghoſt then her ſelf;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56550:27"/>
the Queen ſhutting the dore upon her, thus began. <hi>Though it be a long time</hi> Zelinda <hi>ſince we loſt both; you the beſt Mother in the world, and I the beſt Friend; Neither the affection that I had for her, nor the laſt words ſhe recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to my care, with ſhall ever be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: And had theſe former conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations been wanting, your Beauty, your Wit, and Diſcretion, would have ſince obliged me to it. Having Bread you up ſo long, and having found all theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that gained her my affection, ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you with more Luſter: I were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable had I not the ſame Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for you, that I profeſt to her. Then ſay I have done more for you then ever ſhe askt of me, ſhe only deſired me to love you as her Daughter, and I have loved you like my own; my Daughter loſt the Title of an only Child from the day your Mother dyed. Since when I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you both as equally my own, and conſequently none of your actions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns have been indifferent to me, ſo that you may imagine it is impoſſible but I muſt have taken notice of that paſſion which your Beauty (though without</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56550:28"/>
               <hi>leave) has raiſed in the heart of</hi> Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis: <hi>I have been no leſs then your ſelf in pain for the injury it might do you. You know how little aſſurance there is in the the words of men of his age and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; both which gave him a licenſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and falſifie his Promiſes: Be your own Judge, whether his affection can ever be any advantage to you, you ſee how many reaſons oppoſe it, and ſhould it ever come into his power and yours, you are too juſt, too grateful, to take him from the Daughter of one you are ſo much obliged to. I know your Vertue</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, <hi>but as great as it is you cannot hinder the Prince from ſeeing you, nor the World from Talking of it; your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may avoid the ill, but cannot eſcape the noiſe; I know the prejudice ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are to thoſe of your Sex, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the diſcontent they give thoſe of your Scrupulous Vertue: I thought it then my duty to lead you out of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and that it was now high time to fulfill the Promiſe I made your Mother. The Prince of</hi> Tarentum <hi>is Wiſe, Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Valliant, one of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Princes in</hi> Italy; <hi>He has by his</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56550:28"/>
               <hi>Letters and Ambaſſadors, made ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to me, that he might have you in Marriage; I would never acquaint you with particulars till all was ſettled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the buſineſs ripe for Execution. I hear he expects ſuddainly to lay at your Feet his Perſon, and Dominions; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of this Veſſel left him fifteen days ago, and obliged himſelf in as many more to bring you to him, according to my Orders, Diligence and Secrecy for ſome reaſons which I cannot yet let you know, are very important to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, therefore you muſt go away imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and without any Train. I doubt not but this your good nature finds ſome trouble in this ſuddain parting, but though the Sea ſeparate us for a while, nothing ſhall divide our affections; and I hope one day to ſee you with a Luſter and Magnificence, which ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the private condition you leave us in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſure you ought to be glad, you are returning into a Countrey where you ſhall find your Fortune, your Friends, and the place of your Birth. But although it were not your inclination, it is enough that I will have it ſo: Beſides the power</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56550:29"/>
               <hi>of a Queen; I claim alſo the intereſt of a Mother in you: Conſent then willingly to a thing (which beſide that it is a thing very juſt) is alſo no leſs neceſſary; in following readily what I counſel you, and perhaps command you, you will ſhew that Modeſty that you owe to your ſelf, and a reſpect no leſs due to me: At theſe words ſhe embrac't her; pretending ſhe would not take a formal leave of her, leſt it ſhould too much ſoften both their hearts, ſhe left the Cabin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sorrow, Rage, and Indignation, ſo overwhelmed the mind of <hi>Zelinda,</hi> that for a while ſhe was neither able to ſpeak nor move, ſo that ſhe remained in the condition the Queen left here in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which yet was the happieſt ſhe found her ſelf in for many Months, ſince the greatneſs and ſuddainneſs of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, took from her all ſenſe of it for the time.

and with them her Fear, her Love, and all the paſſions of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Mind; Her life came back to her in ſuch a company that ſhe hated it; her firſt thought was that of throwing her ſelf at the Queens Feet, in hope to change her Cruel purpoſe; but ſhe was gone, and the Ship ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't, that one could hardly ſee the tops of Houſes of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> ſhe turned her eyes that way, and reflecting on what ſhe left, and what ſhe was going to: And having ſeriouſly weighed them a while, ſhe turned her ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that accompanied her with a Countenance more cheerful and Serene then ordinary: and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have received ſome ſatisfaction from the conſolation they gave her: See went to Bed, and entreated them to leave her to her Reſt: Fear and hopes are the two contrary winds of Souls, which never ceaſe, and there is no tempeſt, whereof one or other of them is not the Cauſe: The preſent is but a point, and would be inconſiderable to us, if one or other of theſe paſſions did not give us ſome feeling of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56550:30"/>
               <hi>Zelinda</hi> thought that Fortune had plac't her below her own power of helping, or harming farther: And ſo was in that fatal Tranquility where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men neither fear nor hope, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the end of their Misfortune, with that of their lives, In all theſe Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhe had not that of trying ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral remedies, which is commonly the greateſt paine of the unfortunate. Having well conſidered what ſhe would do, and knowing it could not be long e're ſhe ſhould be freed from her afflictions, ſhe paſt the night in thinking how <hi>Alcidalis</hi> would receive the News of her loſs: And though ſhe was infinitly grieved to part with him, ſhe had ſome ſatisfaction when ſhe thought of the eminent proof it, would give him of her love, and reſolution. The Captain of the Veſſel (beſides that ſhe was then their charge) had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſteem of <hi>Zelinda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> having known her at Court; as ſoon as they thought ſhe was awake they went into her Chamber, and askt her what ſhe would eat, ſhe anſwered that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe would not eat then, but that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56550:30"/>
ſhe would never eat more; this reply amazed them extreamly; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſhe was relapſed into her former Melancholly, and a little Time, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer Remedy, then any diſcourſe. Three or four hours after, finding that ſhe called no body, they returned, and employed all Prayers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to make her receive a little Nouriſhment; to which ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with a Sullen ſilence, and a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heaviour ſo cold, and ſo reſolved, that ſhe ſcarce ſeemed to have heard them: They left her this ſecond time, but began to apprehend ſome Tragical event of this ſtrange reſolution. The next night they came again with a Neece of theirs, who was of the ſame age with <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and kneeling to her, begged her to have a care of her life, with as many Tears, and as much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, as if they had askt their own of her, but all in vain; ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and left her to her ſelf. Three dayes paſt thus whilſt neither Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Tears, or Perſwaſions, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with <hi>Zelinda</hi> to ſpeak one word; but the fourth day theſe good people
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56550:31"/>
with their Neece, came to make their laſt attempt: And deſired her not to be her own Murderer, and commit a Cruelty upon a Perſon ſo excellent, as even the rudeſt Barbarians would both ſpare and Worſhip: <hi>Zelinda</hi> having hearkned a while to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, fetcht a deep Sigh, and riſing from her Seat, ſhewed her ſelf plain to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which made them the better perceive the extremity ſhe was in; in the Beautifulleſt Face in the World, they beheld a frightful Image of diſpair and approaching Death, and ſomewhat that gave at once horrour and pitty; having looked round upon them all, ſhe thus broke the Silence, ſhe ſo long had kept.</p>
            <q>My Friends, you ask of me a thing, that only you can give me, you would have me live, and I would willingly obey; but have reſolved never to come alive upon the Shore of <hi>Italy,</hi> and here I ſwear it once more, to the Gods above, by Fire, and Light, and to thoſe below by the Ghoſts of my Anceſtors: My life is then no

            <p>Then taking out a little Box the Queen had left her, where all the Jewels of her Mother were, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <q>Theſe Jewels are of infinite Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, the Queen cannot make you a greater Preſent; except ſhe gives you <hi>Barcelona.</hi> Take them, and give me nothing in return, but my Life and Liberty; and ſince Liberty it ſelf, is more then all the Riches of the World, I ſhall acknowledge my ſelf ſtill your Debtor; too many would kill the Innocent <hi>Zelinda,</hi> for half the Wealth I offer you to ſave her: I buy a good Virtuous Action of you, at a Price able to engage many men in the the moſt Barbarous: If you make a ſcruple of diſobeying the Queen, you

ought to have an horrour for the death of an Innocent; will you rather chooſe to deſtroy one of her Friends, then to break one of her commands; If you are afraid of her diſpleaſure or wrong, you ſhould conſider, that ſhortly <hi>Alcidalis</hi> will be greater in <hi>Arragon</hi> then ſhe, who will ſeek you all over the World, and bring you to a ſevere account for my Life, and Perſon: But if all theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould not prevaile, I conjure you by the Friendſhip you have profeſt to me, by the compaſſion you ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but now, by theſe Tears, and all that is dear to you, to deliver me from this Diſtraction I am in, your ſuddain reſolution will double the Obligation, and incline me to believe, that you were diſpoſed to it more through your generous Pitty of my afflicted innocence, then any other conſideration: But if neither my Prayers, nor Tears, nor Offers, can prevail with you: This Tongue that has pleaded my Cauſe ſo unſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall never ſpeak again, and death in a ſhort time will give me that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which you refuſe.</q>

            <p>Then ſhe ſhewed them all her Jewels, which Charmed their Eyes, as much as her Diſcourſes had done their Ears, ſo that they were no longer able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that double violence: The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was a Souldierly man, and very Brave, who had run through divers Fortunes without ever making his own: He thought now was the time or never, ſo that ſtraight computing how many Veſſels he might ſet out with a good part of that Wealth he ſaw; immediatly all <hi>Zelinda</hi> had ſaid to him appeared unanſwerable, he thought himſelf oblidged in Honour to relieve ſo Lovely and Injured a Princeſs: Beſides, that he might one day reſtore her to <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him as great a recompence, as he had done for her. He was a great while without ſpeaking, ſo that <hi>Zelinda</hi> fearing his Silence, proceeded from his irreſolution, doubled her intreaties, till at laſt he yielded, and vow'd to obey what ever ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: She engaged to go into a Monaſtery, and never to leave it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent: <hi>Zelinda</hi> was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56550:34"/>
that Prodigious Beauty that had made ſo much noiſe, was very well Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her, and attributed her Alteration partly to her Indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, partly to her Voyage, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat for the Extravagance of Report, which is ever in Extreams. The Captain and his Wife having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very conſiderable Preſents, took their leave of the Duke, and put to Sea, pretending an Impatience they had to give the Queen an account of their happy Voyage. <hi>Zelinda</hi> ſtayed all this while in the Veſſel, and when ſhe ſaw the Captain and his Wife A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, preſt them to Hoyſt Saile, and ſhed as many Tears of Joy at her leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Italy,</hi> as ſhe had of Sorrow at her quitting <hi>Spain:</hi> But what avails it, the unhappy to eſcape one Misfortune; or what Sanctuary is there for theſe whom Fortune is reſolved to Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute; all the earth is ſubject to her Empire, but the Sea ſeems to be particularly under her Dominion, it is there ſhe excerciſes her Power moſt Tyrannically; and moſt Treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, enriching her Favourites with the

Spoiles of the Induſtrious: Yet as if there were nothing more to be feared, <hi>Zelinda</hi> thanked Heaven, and being on an Element the moſt deceiptful of the four, among people ſhe could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing farther from, having nothing more to bribe them with. She imagined her ſelf as ſecure as if ſhe had been in a Pallace, and in the midſt of her Friends: They made towards <hi>Sardignia,</hi> where the Captain deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave <hi>Zelinda;</hi> with a Siſter of his, till he could find an opportunity to reſtore her to <hi>Alcidalis;</hi> they had Sailed three dayes with a Fair Wind, when two hours before the Sun ſet, he upon the Watch, from the top of the Maſt, cryed he ſaw three Sailes making towards them; Men live no where with ſo little ſecurity, as upon that Element, The Water, Earth, Air, and Fire, are all Enemies of thoſe that are at Sea; but Men moſt of all, and there is nothing that one Veſſel apprehends ſo much, as the Meeting of another; not long after they looked again, and they ſaw the Tops of three Sailes, which ſeemed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56550:35"/>
not to be above three Leagues off; an hour after they came more in View, ſo that they knew them to be Pyrates. Our Captain commanded his men to Hoiſt all their Sailes and run for't: The next Morning as ſoon as it was broad day, they perceived the Pirates were aſide of them, and within ſix Miles, ſo that if they gained upon them in the Morning proportionably to what they had done in the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they judged that by Noon they would be within Cannon-Shot; thoſe that were in the Veſſel were a little apprehenſive, the fearful took them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Crying and Howling, the moſt reſolved, to their Arms: And the moſt reaſonable, concluded, that neither the one nor other were to any great purpoſe; Though the Captain had experience enough to know that he could not Defend himſelf long, yet he choſe rather to die like a man of Honour, then to yield and looſe that Wealth he was ſo lately and ſo luckily poſſeſt of. In this Alarum and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral confuſion, <hi>Zelinda</hi> alone was not aſtoniſht, and whilſt others feared for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56550:36"/>
their Goods, and their Liberties, ſhe to whom all theſe things were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, thought only for preſerving her Honour: After having throughly conſidered the danger ſhe was in, and the remedies it was capable of; She ſhut her ſelf into her Chamber with the Captains Wife, where the firſt thing ſhe did, was to throw all her Ornaments into the Sea, leaſt they ſhould diſcover her, then cutting off the Fineſt Haire in the World, ſhe Wept a while in the conſideration of what Fortune had reduced her to; but at laſt ſhe called for a Suit of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of the Captains, and Diſguiſed her ſelf and Sex. In the mean time the three Veſſels which they knew belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Cannon-Shot of them, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a Gun, to ſee if they would Strike Saile, but finding they did not, but pretended to defend themſelves, when they came within convenient diſtance they gave them a Broad-Side: thoſe of the Veſſel did the ſame, but with a very different ſucceſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no harm at all to the Enemies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56550:36"/>
they had their Maſt and two of their Sailes Shot in pieces, their Veſſel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Shattered, and many of the Souldiers killed; at this noiſe <hi>Zelinda</hi> came out of her Chamber, and put her ſelf among the foremoſt, hoping that ſhe ſhould by that means either be killed the ſooner, or diſguiſe her ſelf the better, the Combate was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal that it was impoſſibie it ſhould laſt long, and all the reſiſtance they were able to make, could not hinder the Pirates from Boarding the Veſſel; where after they had killed ten or twelve of the moſt Reſolute, and amongſt the reſt the Captain, the Seamen threw down their Arms, and yeilded to Mercy The Captain of theſe Veſſels was of the Kingdom of <hi>Barca,</hi> the people of it are very Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, they drive no Trade at all, what we call Robbing, they call Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Enemy, and whatever they purchaſe with their Blood, they count ſtill the bravelier, and moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly gotten; and would be aſhamed of any other Title to it.

Valliant and Skilfull in Sea Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, was a long time the Terrour of all the Coaſts of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> he had Mercy, and Generoſity more then his Country, or indeed his Profeſſion allowed of, naturally and without knowing they were Vertues: As there are in the North, ſome Veins of Gold as perfect as thoſe in the Indies, though not in ſo great quantity. So nature in all Climates does produce now and than an extraordinary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, which ſhe inſtructs and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivates her ſelf, and indues with all imaginable perfection without help of Art.

Fortune, and with an aſſurance more uſual in the Conquerours then the vanquiſht, her Conſtancy, her Courage, prevailed more on the Generous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Captain, then all the mean Submiſſion of the reſt, he was charmed with the Greatneſs of her Mind, and Beauty of her Perſon, and deſired her to be of good Courage, ſince ſhe was fallen into the hands of one, who made Slaves of none but ſuch as deſerved to be ſo. That for himſelf he ſought Glory more then Gain upon the Sea, and took more pleaſure to give Liberty, then to make Slaves. That he left the reſt of the Prize to his Souldiers, and deſired only <hi>Zelidan</hi> for himſelf, and that the firſt brave Action they were in, ſhould be his Ranſome. <hi>And Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>If the advantages of your Mind, anſwer thoſe of your Perſon, I ſhall ſoon be more a Captive to your Worth, then you are to my Arms.

(which elſe would be of great advantage to her) would be infallibly her ruine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She took all the care imaginable to conceal her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exerciſing her Courage, and all theſe Qualities that her Sex is leaſt capable of. They paſt all that Summer without ever landing, but to take in Freſh-Water, in which time the new <hi>Zelidan</hi> ſignalized himſelf on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: There was no Veſſel taken where he was not the firſt Aboard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the Pirate found no difficulty to pay him the full eſteem and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he had promiſed: The Winter coming on, and the Sea growing fuller of fears, then hopes even for Pyrates themſelves, they laid up their Veſſel in the firſt Port of <hi>Barca: Orantes</hi> gave <hi>Zelidan</hi> his Liberty with a great many Complements, and profeſſions of perpetual Friendſhip: He deſired to bring him to Court, ſaying he would ſhew the King the Richeſt Prize he ever took upon the Sea.

certainly the greateſt ills of Mind and Body, raged at once in <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> every one of them with their moſt deſperate Circumſtances: So that each ſeemed incurable and altogether unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: But at length contrary to all expectation he recovered, but with his Health, his Grief, his Love, and all cares returned; ſo that without ſtaying till he was perfectly recovered, or making any one acquainted with his deſigne, he ſtole out of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> and going a by way to the Kingdom of <hi>Valentia,</hi> he embarqued at the neareſt Port, and paſt over into <hi>Italy:</hi> Where he hoped to ſee <hi>Zelinda,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was all the Happineſs he was capable of in her abſence; The falſe <hi>Zelinda</hi> had better Fortune then the true one, and her deſignes better ſucceſs, ſhe had, as obſerved, a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Beauty, and that kind of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that gives us cunning and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility for the Affairs of the World, ſeeing what a dangerous buſineſs ſhe had undertaken, ſhe endeavoured all ſhe could to gaine the Prince her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Heart, and ſo fortifie her ſelf
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56550:40"/>
againſt all accidents: He was of thoſe years wherein men begin to feel the approaches of Old Age, and to be ſomewhat leſs confident of themſelves, and where the moſt reaſonable and beſt deſerving cannot hope to be loved by Women, but out of gratitude or duty: So that the Beauty, Conduct, and Kindneſs, of his Young Wife, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him intirely: As we are never ſo fond of Flowers, as in the beginning of the Spring, or towards the end of Autumne; the firſt for their Novelty, and the others becauſe we think we ſhall ſee them no more: So the pleaſures of love are at no time ſo dear to us, as in the buginning of our Youth, and the approaches of our Age: It is ſo great and unexpected a Happineſs for an Old Man to be loved, that there is no folly they are not capable of in that condition, but the knowledge they have of themſelves, ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them ever to be firmly perſwaded of it. The Duke was no ſooner in love, but he became Jealous; That paſſion which in other Countries is an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effect of love, is there inſeperable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56550:40"/>
from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they conclude there cannot be a great deſire, without a great fear. Love and Jealouſy are Twins with them, and ever born together. Were it then the exceſs of kindneſs, the Air of his Countrey, or his own natural diſtruſt, or that he had heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerning <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> that had cauſed that effect; his Jealouſy arrived to that height, that he never thought her ſafe but when ſhe was with him, and even then had ſcarce patience ſhe ſhould be ſeen by any eyes but his own. She who for another reaſon cared not to be ſeen much, eaſily complied with his Humour, and told him ſhe loved all the effects of his Paſſion equally, that his very fears were agreeable to her ſince they were marks of his Love: That her greateſt content was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his, that in having him, ſhe thought ſhe had all the World, and cared not if ſhe was ſhut up for ever on theſe Tearms. He receives theſe offers of hers with great joy, and made uſe of the Liberty ſhe gave him to take away all hers, ſo that cutting off dayly ſomwhat of her Attendants, and of a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56550:41"/>
great Pallace, which before ſhe had the freedom of, he reduced her to four or five Rooms, and a few neceſſary Servants, as the Duke gave her many marks of his Jealouſy, he alſo gave her ſome of his Love. And ſtrove to make her Priſon as agreeable to her as poſſible, there was no part of the World that did not contribute its greateſt varieties to her Cloſets. Art and nature ſeemed to ſtrive which ſhould moſt adorne her Retirement. And ſhe ſaw all things ſhe could wiſh, but men, and thoſe ſhe ſaw only out her Windows. The Duke bought the Luſtieſt and Handſomeſt Slaves that could be found which (to divert the Malancholy which muſt needs attend ſuch a ſolitude) he cauſed to be taught to Fence, Ride, run at the Ring, and all the exerciſes of the Nobility, by the beſt Maſters of <hi>Italy;</hi> theſe were called the Slaves of the Dutcheſs, thrice a Week they were brought into a Court all ſtrewed with Sand, where they did all their Exerciſes: The Duke had two deſigns in this, one of divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Dutcheſs, and the other of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56550:41"/>
making her deſpiſe all men; by letting her ſee in Slaves, the ſame Qualities which are admired in people of the higheſt Birth, and moſt advantagious Education. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> at his coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> was informed of all this, and judged that no Quality would ſo ſoon introduce him, as that of a Slave to the Dutcheſs; he communicated his deſigns to his Gentleman, who had always attended him; who Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing himſelf like a Merchant, went to the Officers that had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Slaves, and expoſed to ſale <hi>Alcidalis;</hi> who having all the Qualities neceſſary in a very eminent degree; was ſoon Bought, and ſo one of the greateſt and moſt accompliſht men in the World, became a Slave: A while he was fain to learn of them he might have taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeming to learn every day ſomewhat of his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; he in a ſhort time ſo advanced, that he was admired of all the World; if he were challenged to run, Wreſtle, Fence, or Ride, he was ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceſsful, that at laſt he ſeemed but to be invited to ſo many Victories:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56550:42"/>
There was no Prize that any one, or number of his Companions, durſt diſpute with him: Yet among all the commendations he obtained, he felt a ſecret ſhame in himſelf, that his Victories were gained only over a few Slaves, for he had a heart as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous as that Prince, who ſcorned to Run with any but Kings, though he did all things with an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Grace, it was with ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt of what he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that it was no hard matter to ſee his thoughts were ſomewhere elſe: When ever he entered the Liſts, for the Divertiſement of the Dutcheſs, he came the firſt, and went away the laſt; In all his exerciſes he had his Eyes and Heart fixt upon the Window, he thought ſhe ſtood at. For the Jealous Duke had ſo contrived it; that ſhe could ſee without being ſeen: What Miſtakes and Errors are not men cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of, the moſt Faithful Lover upon earth adores now a Beauty he has never ſeen, Sighs before her, and gives her at his eyes his heart: And being born a Slave to <hi>Zelinda,</hi> has blindly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56550:42"/>
ſold himſelf to another: <hi>Alcidalis</hi> who had been remarkable amongſt the moſt accompliſht Princes, was eaſily ſo among theſe Slaves. The firſt day ſhe ſaw him, his Beauty, and the Graces that accompanied all his Actions, attracted the eyes of the Dutcheſs; afterward he gained her eſteem, and then her admiration; and having conſidered how through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe thought ſhe ſaw in his Mine and Courage, ſomewhat worthy of a Nobler deſtiny, and much above his preſent Fortune: She took notice how fixtly he looked up at her Window, of the Paleneſs and Sadneſs of his Face, which all the applauſes continually given him were never able to change for a Minute: All this together gave her at firſt Pity, then Curioſity, and at laſt Love.</p>
            <p>One Night as this Illuſtrious Slave went out of the Palace of the Duke, in a dark Paſſage he felt himſelf pulled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by one, whom by that light he could only perceive to be a Woman; who taking him aſide, ſaid, <hi>Clariantes,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56550:43"/>
(for that was the name he choſe to be called by in this Diſguiſe) <hi>If you are as truly Brave as you appear, come to morrow morning at two a Clock to the foot of the</hi> Greek-Tower, <hi>there you ſhall be put in a way of being the Happieſt man living:</hi> She ſaid this in great haſte, and left him, without ſtaying for his anſwer. But this was enough to ſet his Thoughts a work: Since Fortune began to perſecute his love, this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the firſt Moment ſhe began to remit of her uſual Rigour; he made no queſtion but this Meſſage came from <hi>Zelinda,</hi> ſince to make him Happy was in the power of none but her: Yet whether it be that men ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary hold ſome little intelligence with their deſtiny, or that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate entertain hope but Coldly, which has ſo oft deceiv'd them: he durſt not be confident of his good Fortune, but expected the hour ſhe had aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſucceſſively agitated by Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Hope, and Fear. The time ſo much longed for being come, as ſoon as it was dark he came to the foot of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56550:43"/>
the Tower, which was an old Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which entered ſome fifty Foot into the Sea; <hi>Alcidalis</hi> came in a ſmall Fiſher Boat, which having faſtned to the Wall, he attended the ſucceſs of his Adventure an hour before any body came to him: His Mind all the while no leſs toſs'd between Hope and Fear, then the ſmall Veſſel he was in by the Waves of the Sea: Paſſions which though they are very contrary, are very often together; the Wind was ſo high, that there was ſmall hope the Rope that held the Boat would endure much longer, ſo that every Minute he imagined it would break; at laſt, as he began to deſpair of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Happineſs, and entertain the diſmaleſt thoughts the Night, the Sea, and riſing Storm could furniſh him with; he heard a noiſe from the top of the Tower, which he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, and immediatly ſomthing fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Boat, which he ſoon perceived to be a Ladder of Rope: <hi>Alcidalis</hi> then gave himſelf entirely into the Arms of a deceitful hope, and was confident he ſhould once more behold his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56550:44"/>
               <hi>Zelinda:</hi> which made him ſlight all dangers, and run up the Ladder as faſt as he could have done the eaſieſt Stairs in the World; when he was at the top, he found a Window open, and a Woman who gave him her Hand, and without ſaying any thing, brought him through a great many turnings into a Cloſet, the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Furniſht that ever he had ſeen, lighted with three Lamps of Gold: He perceived then ſhe was the ſame Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had ſpoke to him before in the dark Paſſage; then putting all things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he concluded ſhe came from <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and had now no fear but that of not ſtaying long enough with her: He had a thouſand ſeveral and ſome contrary Paſſions at once in his Mind, which cannot be repreſented on Paper, ſince the Soul of man, and amongſt them, only the Lovers, is capable of ſuch confuſion: He was for an hour in the ſtilleſt Silence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but at laſt he heard, as he thought, the tread of a Woman, and the noiſe of a Key, to which turning his Head about, he ſaw a Door open, and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56550:44"/>
ſame perſon enter who gave him her hand at the Window; who Smiling upon him, ſaid, <hi>Clariantes, I do not doubt but you will pardon me for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made you wait thus long, and confeſs the Honour you are going to receive, an abundant recompence for all you have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</hi> The Prince thanked her; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhe would inform him a little what this Honour was ſhe meant; She pauſed a while, and then replyed, <hi>Were I not by the Greatneſs of your Meen and Courage, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſſured of that of your Mind, I ſhould not venture to let you know your good Fortune thus at once, leſt exceſs of joy ſhould overpower your Spirits; but it is to be ſuppoſed a man of your Merit can never be ſurprized at his good Fortune, whatever it be; know then, that you are now in</hi> Zelinda's <hi>Cloſet, and ſhall immediatly be brought into her Chamber; the Dutcheſs has taken notice of your good Qualities, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs in you but your Fortune, is reſolved to better that her ſelf; and to that end deſires your acquaintance: On your part ſee you make good uſe of this occaſion, and ſhew as much Diſcretion</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56550:45"/>
               <hi>and Conduct hereafter, as you have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhewn Courage and Generoſity.</hi> Having ſaid this, ſhe led him into the Dutcheſſes Chamber. How ſtrangely are our Minds wrought upon? <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> whom death it ſelf would not have diſcompoſed, trembles in a place where he knew there were none but Women; that heart which would have encountered a world of Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, melts at the imaginary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the only perſon upon earth he loves, and knows himſelf to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by: The Chamber had juſt the light that ſuch affairs required, which was not much; the ſhame and diſorder of a Young woman unpractis'd in the Thefts of Love, made her conceal her ſelf ſo much, that had <hi>Alcidalis</hi> been leſs prepoſſeſt then indeed he was, he could not eaſily have found his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: He immediately fell upon his Knees to her, and after a few words confuſedly uttered, and worſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſtopt in the middle of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; Amazement, Joy, and Love ſeiſed him ſo in an inſtant, that half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſide-himſelf he let fall his head upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56550:45"/>
the Bed of the young Princeſs, who lifting it up with her hand, brought him a little to himſelf; but a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his diſorder kept him ſtill in it, ſo that he could only ſay at laſt,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Zelinda,</hi> Heaven has had ſome pity on the unhappy <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and once before I die given me a ſight of thoſe perfections I would have dyed to have ſeen; my love is ſtill the ſame, and I am not the leſs yours for your being anothers; the Tyranny of Fate may force our Perſons out of our own diſpoſal, but hearts are given by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, and ſure what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly taken, we juſtly may recover.</q>
            <p>Here his Sighs interrupted his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutſe, and as he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it, they heard a great noiſe in the Palace, which ſhe that was intruſted came out of Breath to tell them it was the Duke, and that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready on the Dutcheſs Side: Who, good man, far from thinking what had happened, had deſigned to ſpend two
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56550:46"/>
or three days in Hunting; but whether it were Love, or Jealouſie, or that he thought, that for being leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he ſhould be the more welcome to the Dutcheſs; he returned the very day, and the firſt thing he did, came to viſit her. I hate him for coming ſo unſeaſonably; for I would fain have ſeen what reply ſhe would have found to a Diſcourſe ſhe ſo little compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and leſs expected; and had I made the Story, <hi>Alcidalis</hi> ſhould have made him—what the Dutcheſs pleaſed: But as things were, there was no ſtaying any longer, and the Lady that brought him, in all haſte conducted him to the ſame Window he came in it. Seeing and deteſting this laſt Treachery of Fortune, he had more mind to precipitate himſelf, then to make uſe of his Ladder of Ropes, and had done it, but for the hope of Climing up by it another time. The ſweetneſs of that thought perſwaded him to live a little longer, but with many raſh Vows and deep Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not to ſurvive ſuch another Jilting trick; and brought him ſafe,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56550:46"/>
and unobſerved to his Lodging; for the Dukes unexpected arrival had raiſed all from ſleep, and put the Court in ſuch Confuſion, that they ran againſt each other as if it had been at blind-mans-Buffe: (a Recreation much uſed at Courts in that Age, and not yet wholly diſeſteem'd.) To ſave the trouble of making doleful Speeches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and avoid the danger of ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, or worſe then he did, I will not preſume to relate exactly how often <hi>Alcidalis</hi> Sighed, Tumbled, and Rouled in his Bed, ſomtimes Rayling at, and ſometimes wheadling For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; or whether he tore his lovely Hair, which in a thouſand Curls adorned his ſpreading Shoulders; for he being then under the qualification of a Slave, had no attending Eſquire to hear and diſcover his Soliloquies. But let the ingenious Reader imagine, after a long and paſſionate Courtſhip of ſo Beautiful a Lady as <hi>Zelinda,</hi> if he was Kneeling by her Bed, (<hi>the Altar of Love</hi>) preſſing her ſoft Palm, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his amorous head on her panting Breaſt, in the height of extaſie, juſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56550:47"/>
at the Minute of fruition, (for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had been naught together, if the Dukes coming had not prevented them) how it would ſtir him to be diſappointed: And then let him pleaſe his fancy with Speeches ſuitable to his own Humour.—Here ſome Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Zealots may perhaps accuſe me of a groſs miſtake, in ſuppoſing a Prince ſo ſubllmely Virtuous as <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> is Characteriz'd, could be guilty of the common Failings of meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But I refer my ſelf to the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgement of this ripe-witted Age, whether that Lover is not moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whoſe Paſſion has no Limits (maugre the Cruel examples of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis de Gaul,</hi> that flower of Chivalry, and all the Rabble of obſolete Heroes) but in perſuance of its deſign, which is enjoyment one way or other, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pretended to the contrary; tramples all danger, or reaſon under Foot; I'le believe it granted, and proceed to my Story.—The ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of kindneſs, or Jealouſie rather, which hurried the Old Duke from his Countrey diverſions, haſtened him to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56550:47"/>
the Chamber of his Trembling Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs; who received him with moſt extraordinary marks of unuſual Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, the better to palliate her Errour; often renewing her ſtrict Embraces, with a melting voice, ſhe ſaid,</p>
            <q>My Deareſt Lord! The only joy of my Life! Are you well? Are you in my Arms? Oh ſpeak! and confirm me that I am not yet in a Dream—</q>
            <q>No, Dear Madam! <hi>anſwered the over joyed Duke,</hi> it is no Dream; or if it be, it is ſo raviſhing to me, that I could be contented it ſhould never end: But what, my dear <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi> has ſo much diſcompoſed you? Your heart pants and ſtruggles, as if it were weary of its Seat, and ſought for ſhelter in my Breaſt—</q>
            <q>Oh Sir, <hi>ſhe replyed,</hi> receive it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then! and let it ever dwell there, that it may no more be frighted with your abſence. Your coming wakened me from a dreadful Dream; a great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56550:48"/>
Buck, me-thought, aſſaulted you in a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dark Thicket, and was juſt ready to goar your Majeſtick forehead with his Horns; Ha! Horns, cryed the Duke, (ſtarting as if his evil Genius had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared) Heaven avert the Omen! If your preſence had not diſturbed my buſie Fancy, certainly the Dream had gone one, ſays ſhe, and I had dyed with apprehenſion—</q>
            <q>Be comforted, Madam! <hi>ſays the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected Duke,</hi> Dreams are but faint reflections of thoſe laſt thoughts, which imployed the imagination when ſleep ſurprized the Active Senſes; ſo when the Glorious Sun forſakes our Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphear, a Roſie glimmering lighr ſtill guilds the Clouds.</q>
            <q>Ah Sir! I will never conſent that you ſhall leave my Arms, <hi>cryed the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Dutcheſs,</hi> for if your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious life ſhould be deſtroyed, how wretched would the unfortunate <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> be!</q>
            <p>Repeating her Careſſes with ſuch
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56550:48"/>
exquiſite Artifice, and ſeeming Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Duke, believing himſelf moſt egregiouſly Happy in a Kind and Faithful Spouſe, when her heart was all that time inventing new Curſes for him, committed all his cares to a ſound ſleep; which Age, and a little forc'd exerciſe to retaliate his Ladies kindneſs, ſoon brought upon him.</p>
            <p>The next day was ſolemniz'd with more then uſual Sports, where <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidalis,</hi> ſwelled with joyful hopes, performed ſuch extravagant Deeds of Agility and Strength, as I dare not particularize, leſt the incredulous Reader ſhould diſtruſt the truth of all the reſt. The Duke unable to make good returns of Love two nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſhut up his Exchequer, and as an uncivil Debtor that cannot Pay, avoids the ſight of his obliging Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; he ſtole away as abruptly to his Country-Houſe in the Evening, as he had come from thence the Night-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; leaving a Letter to inform and comfort the poor Dutcheſs, with plentifull aſſurances of a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56550:49"/>
adding, that he feared to bid her Farewell, leſt her Grief ſhould betray him to a weakneſs misbecoming a Prince. She had obſerved his cloſe manner of retiring, and gladly gave him opportunity to Cheat himſelf, while he thought to deceive her: but could not read his Conſolatory E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, without downright Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—Old Age, Flannell, and Brandy, ſaid ſhe, farewell! and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately calling <hi>Florella,</hi> (for that was the Lady of her intrigue) ſent her to <hi>Clariantes;</hi> concealing ſtill from her, that it was the Prince <hi>Aleidalis,</hi> (whoſe Name and Actions the Court was well acquainted with) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to continue his miſtake of her for the true <hi>Zelinda;</hi> ordered, that when he came, there ſhould be no light at all in her Chamber. <hi>Florella</hi> found him walking where he had received the former Summons, and failed not to deliver the ſecond Challenge; nor he to repair immediatly to the place appointed. Now Fortune ſeemed to fix her unſteady Wheel; Smooth and Gentle, as a Frozen River, did the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56550:49"/>
Sea appear; and the amicable Moon, an indulgent cheriſher of all Exploits of Love and Art, (like a well-wiſhing Procurer with a dark Lanthorn) from behind a ſable Cloud, diſplayed juſt light enough to lead him on, and not betray him. Swift as a ſealed Dove, and as blind too with his Paſſion, he mounted to his Heaven, the Window, and in one moment more proſtrated himſelf at the Shrine, the Bed of his Saint. Like a gay plum'd Phoenix, wrapped in perfumes, and languiſhing in Flames of Love, ſhe lay; yet trembled like a new yean'd Lamb upon a ſheet of Snow, with eagerneſs of fierce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. After his firſt aſſault of Kiſſes on her melting Hand, his Tongue got liberty to cry, <hi>Ye Gods! do I again behold the fair</hi> Zelinda? (a very pertinent Queſtion, for it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred there was no Light) then overcome with extaſies of joy, his head ſunk gently on her downy Breaſts, which proudly ſwelled to welcom ſo deſired a Gueſt, and meet his burning Kiſſes; while with her tender Arrms, more White then Alpine Snow, ſhe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56550:50"/>
kindly preſſed him cloſer! <hi>Oh my ador'd</hi> Zelinda, (he panting cryed) to which ſhe Ecchoed ſoftly with a Sigh, <hi>Oh my much loved</hi> Alcidalis! <hi>I had been too happy had I been only thine.</hi>—Here their Speech was Smothered with reiterated Kiſſes and Embraces, till urged by opportunity, and ſtimulated with greatneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, with a reſpective Boldneſs he continued—<hi>Why was the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate</hi> Alcidalis <hi>permitted to ſee ſuch dazling Glories, and hope for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible bliſs, as Gods would quit again their Heaven for,—and not—En—j</hi>—! There with a Balmy Kiſs, ſhe put a period to his Words; and with a pretty kind of obliging violence, ſhe checked his wandring hands, while he purſued his purpoſe thus—<hi>If my adored Princeſs thinks my Sufferings yet too inconſiderable to merit her eſteem, if cuitting the powerful Charms of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soveraignty, and forſaking an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent dying Father, to wear the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Garb, and do the mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Offices of Common Slavery, deſerve no Pity; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56550:51"/>
his Face as much as the Dreſs would permit. Scarce was this done, when the Duke entered, claſped him in his Arms, and ſpake the kindeſt things a doting Husband could invent, to oblige the beſt Wife in the World: To which he dar'd make no reply; but <hi>Florella</hi> freed him from that trouble, telling the Duke, a ſuddain Tooth-ach, got by a cold ſhe took the preceding night, made ſpeaking extreamly troubleſome; and ſwelled her Face ſo, ſhe dared not expoſe it to the Air, leſt it increaſed her Malady. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> took the hint, and began to Groan ſo La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably, it put his Grace into ſuch mortal apprehenſions of her danger, that it was hard to judge who was in the greateſt perplexity, He, the Prince, or the Dutcheſs, who lay quaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bed-Cloathes, like a Child frighted with the Tale of Raw head and bloody Bones. Death was the leaſt puniſhment the Lovers could expect, if they were diſcovered. A hundred times did <hi>Alcidalis</hi> reſolve to force his Paſſage over the Dukes feeble Body: But the conſideration of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56550:52"/>
Dutcheſſes danger, as a Woman in diſtreſs, though her impoſture had much incenſed him, diverted all thoſe thoughts to a Generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of freeing her, or ſharing in her deſtiny. Thus Affairs ſtood, when Fortune ſeemed weary of tormenting them, and gave ſome proſpect of hope, for the Uxorious Duke would himſelf be the Meſſenger to call the Phyſitians; which gave all hopes of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things right 'ere he returned; but their Joy vaniſhed like a ſwift reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sun caſt from a moving Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſſe; for the blind Quean, whoſe ſole delight conſiſts in Tantalizing thoſe that truſt her, thruſt them the next Minuit on the very brink of Ruine. The Duke unable to leave his Dear <hi>Zelinda</hi> without a Kiſs, found a ſtrange unuſual Roughneſs on his Chin, and ſurpriſed with a ſudden fit of Jealouſie, ſurveying him the ſame inſtant from Head to Foot, imagined his dimenſions ſix times as big as his <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda's</hi> (for Paſſion blinds the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as ſome Diſeaſes cheat the Sight) and rending off the Head-Dreſs,

and City; but her thoughts were ſtill hankering after <hi>Alcidalis;</hi> purpoſing after a little reſt, and what light ſhe could get by enquiry, to guide her on,—to ſearch the World, till ſhe found him.—The Queen gave every hour new marks of her Paſſion, and ſought occaſion of diſcovering it more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Zelidan;</hi> who by all returns his different Quality would petmit, added Fewel to augment the Flame: And by the Sighs and Torments he obſerved her ſuffer, (for her great heart was loath to make the firſt addreſs; and he as poſitively determined, as he had good reaſon not to eaſe her by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the firſt Courtſhip) received ſome compenſation for her former injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatment. The poor Princeſs was as unable to defend her ſelf from the aſſault of this Victorious Amazon, as the Queen, and with deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentment obſerved her Mothers Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thus did the feigned <hi>Zelidan</hi> revenge, what the true <hi>Zelinda</hi> had endured: Love and Jealouſie, was the buſineſs of the Court; and the Queens ſuppoſed Marriage with <hi>Zeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56550:62"/>

For the blind fears, or unreaſonable wiſhes of the inconſiderate Multitude, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways anticipate the intentions of their Princes; transforming their very ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thoughts into Acts, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their publick cenſure, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, e're they have Being. The Queen obſerving how carefully <hi>Zeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> declined all occaſions of being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqu'd, reſolved to puſh on her deſtiny, by a naked Declaration of her Love.

Save your ſelf by ſudden Flight, the Rebellious Citizens are again in Arms, and Headed by a deſperate Stranger, like an impetuous Torrent that has o'reflowed its Banks, are rouling to the Palace, overthrowing all oppoſition with their reſiſtleſs Fury.

The Princeſs, who till then had ſmothered her Paſſion for <hi>Zelidan</hi> in the narrow limits of her Breaſt, deſpairing of ſucceſs againſt a Rival, which Duty forbad her to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſeeing what ſhe prized dearer then her ſoul, haſting to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent death; took a Sword from the neareſt Attendant, and followed <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidan,</hi> hoping ſome Fatal Blow would in his ſight end her hopeleſs Paſſion, with her life. The brave Stranger
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56550:63"/>
(for ſo his Acts declared him) that led on the Citizens, conquered all oppoſition; till <hi>Zelidans</hi> arrival put a cheque to his growing victory. With an undaunted Meen ſhe met him, and by her reſolute Action, gave proof of a Courage far above her ſtrength; but the invincible <hi>Alcidalis</hi> (for he it was) who had before conquered her in her own Province of Love, found but ſmall danger from her Arms. He received her firſt charge on his Shield, and by ſeveral marks taking her for <hi>Zelidan</hi> the famous Stranger, and as he thought pretender to his Crown; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>If thou wilt be a King, go Reign among the ſhades! and boaſt thou dyedſt by the hand of</hi> Alcidalis. At the beloved name of <hi>Alcidalis, Zelidan</hi> endeavoured to retreat, and diſcover her ſelf; but in vain, for with ſuch fierce Blows he purſued his Speech, that ſhe fell Breathleſs at his Feet. The unhappy amorous Princeſs, ſtriving with her feeble Arms to defend the fallen <hi>Zelidan,</hi> notwithſtanding all <hi>Alcidalis</hi> could do to preſerve her, fell a deplorable Sacrifice to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56550:64"/>
Rabble, and dyed imbracing of <hi>Zelidan.</hi> The Queen, who from a Window beheld all this Action, at firſt lamented not the death of her Daughter; but conſidering her as a Rival, Sacrificed all ſentiments of Nature to the ſatisfaction of her jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. But ſeeing her beloved <hi>Zelidan</hi> Bleeding on the ground, extremity of Grief made her ſo inſenſible of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderations, that ſhe was about to precipitate her ſelf from the Window: But hope, which is the laſt thing that leaves the unfortunate, made her ſtill think it not impoſſible to recover him. She was running out to that purpoſe, when <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> now a compleat Victor, was entring the Pallace: with all the ſubmiſſion of a Pious Son, he met her; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>He would take all for Enemies, that failed to render her the Honour due to the Widow, and Mother of their King.</hi> Without ſtaying, or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at all; but with an upbraiding look, (where Rage and Compaſſion ſtrove for Superiority) which ſeemed to call him a thouſand Cruel Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reres;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56550:64"/>
ſhe abandoned her ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the impulſe of her Paſſion, and caſting her body on thoſe of <hi>Zelidan</hi> and the Princeſs her Daughter, ſhe divided her Kiſſes and Lamentations between them: 'Till exceſſive ſorrow, like a Tyrannical Uſurper, ſeized and oppreſſed all her Vitals: By its ſad weight reducing her to a ſtate as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, and void of life, as theirs whom ſhe grieved for. Never had Love and Grief a greater Sacrifice then here, nor miſery more powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to gain compaſſion from the moſt obdurate hearts: (here is a large Field for the Author to expatiate on the viciſſitude of humane things; but the Gentle Reader would think him very inhumane, nay in my Conſcience acceſſary to their Murthers, if he ſuffered three of the moſt Illuſtrious Perſons in the World, to lye neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ground, and dye for want of careful attendance, while he was ſhewing his Common-place Wit; therefore he haſtens to their relief, with reſolution to ſave them all if he can:) <hi>Alcidalis</hi> took the Queen in his

Arms, while others performed the ſame ſervice to the Princeſs and <hi>Zeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> conveying them to their ſeveral apartments; the uncertain Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that ſome few Minutes before breathed nothing but death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them; now followed them Houling and Groaning. All the Arts and ſtrength of Phyſick were diligently applyed, which reſtored ſome weak ſymptoms of life in <hi>Zelidan;</hi> and thoſe were carefully Cheriſhed; but the unfortunate Princeſs was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably dead. The Queens Swouning being only the effect of a vehement ſurprizing Paſſion, death ſoon was beaten off, and his pale ſpreading En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns rufled up by her returning Senſes: But life came accompanied with all thoſe killing Griefs that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on its exile, which like the envyed Favourites of ſome weak unhappy Prince (for forrows ſoon inſinuate themſelves into the hearts affection) raiſed new Commotions among the ſouls diſcontented faculties, and the oppreſſed Senſes, (thoſe neceſſary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ſupport of Life) which were
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56550:65"/>
like to prove as fatal as the former; had not the News of <hi>Zelidans</hi> hopeful Recovery repreſſed their Violence, by the removal of the cauſe.—Weak as ſhe was, ſhe cauſed her ſelf to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to his apartment.—But, Gods! what a univerſal amazement ſeized the Queen, and all the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, to find their Champion was a Woman? For ſo her ſwelling Breaſts declared, which by undreſſing her, the better to apyly their neceſſary aid, were diſcovered. Her Senſes in a little time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were perfectly reſtored; and 'twas difficult for the moſt curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver to determine, whether the Queen or <hi>Zelinda</hi> (for ſo we muſt call her, now ſhes diſcovered) was in the greateſt confuſion; after they had a long time gazed upon each other, the Queen finding in the transformed <hi>Zelidan,</hi> the well known Beauty and Meen of the perſecuted <hi>Zelinda;</hi> lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eyes to Heaven cryed out; <hi>I yeild! juſt Gods, I yeild to my inexorable deſtiny! Ab</hi> Zelinda! <hi>thy injuries have been too well revenged.</hi>—Having ſaid this, e'r <hi>Zelinda</hi> could anſwer, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56550:66"/>
Love being now wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinct, Nature reſumed her power, and carried her to the apartment of the Princeſs, where with ſuch moving paſſion ſhe deplored her loſs, that the moſt inſſible were forced to ſympathize with her. The News of <hi>Zelidans</hi> Transformation, flew ſtraight through the Pallace, and the extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the change, raiſed a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Curioſity in <hi>Alcidalis</hi> to behold her, for he had not heard that it was <hi>Zelinda.</hi> The Meſſengrr he ſent to obtain that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, entered her Chamber, juſt as one was going from her to entreat the favour which he ſought. The Prince full of ſhame for his Victory over a Woman, haſtened to beg her pardon; When he entered, his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants reſpectively withdrew to the furtheſt part of the Room. Neither the Paleneſs her loſs of Blood had planted on her Cheeks, nor their long ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, could hinder the diſcovery of the true <hi>Zelinda</hi> at firſt ſight:—So perfectly had love engraven her Image in his heart. What Pen can deſcribe the Violence of their differnt Paſſions
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56550:66"/>
which then Tyrannized in this Princes Breaſt? Shame and grief for wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her he prized above his Life, and joy that ſhe ſurvived, and was in a place where he was now ſole Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and able to give and receive the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proofs of a mutual, unalterable Love, (like meeting Tydes, whoſe oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forces change ſwift running<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Streams a while into a fixed Calme) reduced him to a ſtate of inſenſibility:—With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Speech or motion, he beheld her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such extaſies are the uſual effects of ſudden Joys or Grief; the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurprized, and oppreſſed with unexpected Events, all the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits croud ſo faſt to its aſſiſtance, that they often cauſe that ruine Nature ſends them to prevent.

he knew what he ought to ſpeak, and act, but the greatneſs of his Love, and violence of his deſires, took from him all ability of utterance; till <hi>Zelinda,</hi> whoſe condition much reſembled his, fearing his ſilence proceeded from ſome change in his affection, thus began.—</p>
            <q>Is this the kind reception <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> gives the unfortunate <hi>Zelinda?</hi> do all the dangers I have paſt, and all my conſtant Love, merit this cold return?

Oh <hi>Alcidalis!</hi> let thy Sword give me a ſpeedy and more welcome death then thy diſdain!—</q>
            <p>Here caſting himſelf on the Bed, and imbracing her, he could get out no more but, <hi>Oh my deareſt</hi> Zelinda! and was relapſing again into his former extaſie; which overcoming, with much difficulty he proceeded.—</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56550:67"/>Your ſafety and your love (my ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Zelinda!</hi>) are bleſſings too great to be received at once, with leſs concern: Since your loſs, in blindneſs to all other objects of delight, I have wandred ore the World; pardon me, if I could not meet the firſt appearance of my Glorious Sun, without amazement. Give me, ye Divine Powers! pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned ſtrength to bear my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, leſt like a ſtarving man, while I too greedily receive it, that haſtens my death which only can reſtore my fainting life.—</q>
            <q>Then do you yet love me? (cryed the overjoyed Princeſs;) and will the King, keep thoſe vowes which <hi>Alcidalis</hi> made to the then Happy <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda?</hi>—</q>
            <q>For ever! for ever! (anſwered the tranſported <hi>Alcidalis</hi>) the enjoyment of my adored <hi>Zelinda,</hi> is more then ten thouſand Empires.—</q>
            <q>Ah Sir, (ſaid ſhe) but intereſt of State.—</q>
