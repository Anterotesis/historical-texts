            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the last Messenger, the Packet from <hi>Ireland</hi> taken in the Vessel at <hi>Padstow,</hi> was sent unto you, which I hope came safe to your hands; by which original Letters under the hand of the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> you will perceive how (as yet) he is imployed for the bringing over of an Army, and what private correspondency there is between him, the Prince, the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and other persons of Note (notwithstanding, he is under the cloud of being accused of High Treason) his being at liberty, and acting the Kings Commands in bringing over
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103097:3"/>
an Army of natural Irish Rebels, and his correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the Prince, <hi>Hopton, &amp;c.</hi> is enough to satisfie the World, by whose Command he manages that Affair. I also acquainted you with a Summons sent to the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> (or rather honorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) if he would instantly lay down Arms, and disband the Forces in the West, which being sent unto him upon Thursday last, and no Answer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on Friday: On Saturday the Army advanced towards St. <hi>Cullumb,</hi> and being drawn to a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz four miles from <hi>Bodman;</hi> the Weather proved so extreme Wet, that it was not held fit to advance on any further that day; and so the Foot were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Quarters in Villages thereabouts, and a mile or two forwards: The Horse being likewise at the Rendezvouz, returned to their Quarters; but some went to Quarter neerer the Enemy, and to the Guards, except a very good party of about eight hundred Horse and Dragoons, commanded by Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> who was sent away with the same, with Orders to fall upon the Enemies Guards or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as he should see it most fit for the service; and accordingly within two hours of Evening, fell upon their Out-guards neer St. <hi>Cullumb,</hi> beat them to their Main guard: Being then drawn up in a Body, ours likewise drew into three Divisions; one command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> another by Major <hi>Fincher,</hi> and the third by Major <hi>Scroop:</hi> The Enemy seeing no way but to fight, the Van of them gave a very good charge: Major General <hi>Pert</hi> breaking through one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103097:3"/>
Division himself: But they were instantly put to the Rout, and we had the pursuite of them for three or four Miles, killing many, took about an hundred prisoners, whereof Major General <hi>Pert</hi> was one, and betwixt two hundred and three hundred Horse. This so Alarm'd the Enemy, that it made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the Head-quarter for a mile, and caused them to draw all their Horse to a Rendezvouz at eleven of the Clock that night on <hi>Michel</hi> Down, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Wet in a great Rain till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thinking the whole Army had been advanced. Our party returned to St. <hi>Cullumb,</hi> and this morning brought the prisoners to Town. This party of the Enemies were of the Princes own Regiment, most of them Reformadoes Officers; they confesse their Souldiers are very weary, and that if it were published among them, they might have Passes to go home, it was not in the Officers power to keep them together: They likewise say, that most of their Officers, if they knew they might be accepted into the protection of the Parliament, they would desert the Service.</p>
            <p>Being askt, if they had heard any Propositions were sent unto them from the General, offering ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conditions both to Officers and Souldiers, they answered they never heard of any; so by that we perceive the Lord <hi>Hopt on</hi> with some few of his Councel keeps the propositions from being publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: There are some others come from thence, who say that the French are mighty inquisitive to know
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103097:4"/>
whether they might be so far received into savour as to have leave to go beyond seas: Laying all these together we are of opinion, that it will not be in <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> power to hinder a good effect to the propositions sent him; so soon as the same is published amongst them, which before this, we hope by some means that hath been used is effectually done: This day the Generals Trumpeter that went with the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is returned with a brief answer from the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> to this purpose: That he had taken the letter from the General into consideration, but the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain advance of our forces gave an interruption to mention at this time any particulars, but by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter of his own he would send a particular answer: The Trumpeter was curteously used and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, This evening the Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Trumpeter is come with a letter in answer to the Generals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which indeed implies a willingnesse to end the businesse of the West without more blood shed, but yet desires to be satisfied whether the King and Parliament be not near a conclusion of a Peace; for being intrusted by the King, it concerns him to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his honour as long as he can; and yet withal inclines to have some Countrey Gentleman come unto him to satisfie him of the state of affaires: Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king altogether, it argues a coming to us, though it seems yet a distance, or else a way to get time (which I rather believe, because he invites a cessation) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til some Irish do land, which is the thing rumoured abroad in their Army, and expected to be there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103097:4"/>
eight and forty hours; and indeed a duplicate of that Packet we intercepted at Padstow, is since ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with the enemy, whereby its probable they hasten ships unto them, for the bringing over those Irish that were intended for Chester into these parts: What ever his intention is, the General will not lose a minute of time: All the Regiments this day advanced to and beyond Cullomb, within three miles of Truro with a great part of the horse; the headquarter is at Bodman with one Regiment there, which we leave to secure the passe.</p>
            <p>To morrow the General and Lievtenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advance after the Army, and I believe will quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at Truro to morrow at night: This advance as it is like to further a good effect upon the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (if God incline their hearts unto it) so it will I hope dispatch the businesse before such time as any Irish can land: If there be a Treaty it must not be such a one as shall take up above one dayes time: therefore a few dayes will decide that businesse, and I hope (with Gods blessing) much to your advantage and the peace and welfare of this Kingdom. Major General <hi>Pert</hi> is run through the body, and shot in the body yet not mortal: There was found in his Pocket a Copy of a Letter to the Lords, about the Prince, either sent, or to be sent by him, advising them, That now was a good time to Trear, before our Forces advanced further; declaring, That they feared else their Condition would be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103097:5"/>
The Countrey is very forward to assist in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocadoing up of all Lanes and Passes, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Enemy (if they intend to break through) may attempt to passe by. This being all I have to trouble you with, I rest,</p>
