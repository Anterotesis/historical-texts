            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which was intended by himſelfe in his
prayers: which was not (as hee ſayth) for
any good ſucceſſe towards the Rebels in
<hi>Ireland</hi> in the late Queenes time: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22045:6"/>
adding, that he euer deteſted

               </p>
               <p>That vpon the late Queenes death,
when his Maieſtie was proclaimed King, he
was very ioyfull; ſent wine to a bonfire not
farre from him: and afterwards, fearing
ſome euill intent, becauſe hee perceiued
ſome, who had been alwayes too forward
in diſobedient attempts, to goe with great
attendance vpon them in gallantrie, hee
divulged his letters of perſwaſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement

Catholikes and Prieſts, that in any wife
they ſhould be quiet, and attempt nothing,
but liue as became Subiects, in duetiful and

               <p>That vpon the publiſhing of the othe of

did concurre with him in opinion therein,
though there were ſome that diſſented.</p>
               <p>That when M. <hi>Singleton</hi> was baniſhed,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22045:7"/>
this Examinate, as fearing that his former

deliuer vnto him the reaſons of ſuch his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and directions to be imparted euen
vnto the Pope himſelfe, if occaſion ſhould
require.</p>
               <p>That matters were handled with ſuch
ſpeede, as that M. <hi>Singleton</hi> in his iourney
towards <hi>Rome</hi> met a <hi>Breue</hi> from this Pope
<hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, at <hi>Sienna,</hi> comming towards
the Low Countries, to be ſent from thence
hither.</p>
               <p>That after the departure of M. <hi>Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
this Examinate not contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with that which he had committed to
his relation, prepared one purpoſely, to
haue been ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> with all his reaſons
in writing: and in the meane while, till his
ſayd meſſenger might be ready, he wrote
his Letters and reaſons with a more ſpeedy
paſſage, to haue ſtayed all directions or
<hi>Breues</hi> againſt the taking of the ſayd oath
of Allegeance.</p>
               <p>That when his ſayd Letters were come
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22045:7"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> none durſt preſent his reaſons to

how he himſelfe hauing had ſpeach with
the chiefeſt Cardinals, and moſt of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

that his this Examinates ſayd opinion is
condemned already in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> as hee

vnder God his holy protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I haue eſcaped dangers, albeit they were

But now of late it hath pleaſed our gracious

who long hath gaped after me: for the ſaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of whoſe ſoule, if I be as carefull, as he hath
been forward vpon the apprehenſion of my
body, I ſhall but performe the duety of a good
Chriſtian. I thanke God, that in all my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
of twelue dayes cloſe impriſonment,
and of eight Examinations at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22045:13"/>
haue giuen no occaſion to any perſon to ſpeake
euill of me; neither (as I trust) ſhall I runne
vpon your hard cenſures for any thing I haue
done. I muſt confeſse, but not without much
griefe, that in the courſe of my Examinations,
I espied great defects of ſincere dealing among
our ſelues: for the Lord Archbiſhop made an
heauie preſent vnto me of his holineſse Briefs,
and of the copies of my Letters about the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the ſame, with ſuch other preſsing
euidences of all my proceedings, that I could not
auoide, without a reproachfull note, and much
diſcredite, the force of trueth in the points ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
againſt mee. But the urging ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent
point was, to knowe, whether I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
or reteined ſtill the continuance of my
former opinion about the lawfulneſſe of taking
the Oath of Allegeance: For anſwere; finding
what hatred, and iealoufneſſe wee haue incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in the opinion of his Maieſty and the State,
for the refuſall of the Oath; and thereupon
making a reuiew of the reaſons, drawing mee
into the former publike approbation thereof;
and relying vpon very mouing conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22045:13"/>
deliuered by his Maiestie the nineteenth
of March, <hi>An.</hi> 1603. which are now in print:
And further, being informed how the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
did purpoſely auoid to call into queſtion
the authoritie of the Pope to Excommunicate,
but did onely intend to preuent the dangers
which might enſue by the ſuppoſed doctrine of
ſuch inferences as thereupon hath beene made,
and are mentioned in that Oath: Vpon theſe
reſpects &amp; others, I granted and made knowen
the admittance of my former Opinion, and did
accept of the Oath of Allegeance, and haue
taken the ſame, word for word, as it is ſet down
in the Statute. Afterwards, falling into ſpeech
of Excommunication, I deliuered my minde:
Firſt, that I thought his Holineſſe would not
at any time Excommunicate his Maieſtie:
Secondly, that no lawfull Excommunication
can or ought to produce, or to enforce ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
effects as haue beene made, and are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in that Oath: Thirdly, that if any ſuch
Excommunication ſhould come from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
that, by the vertue thereof, it ſhould be
thought that his Maieſties ſubiects were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22045:14"/>
of their Oathes and duties of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
or that they were bound to beare armes
againſt him, or to offer uiolence unto his
Royall Perſon, or to commit any treacherie or
treaſon againſt any of his Dominions; I would
holde my ſelfe neuertheleſse, for my part and
eſtate, bound by the Lawe of God to continue
his Maieſties moſt loyall and faithfull ſubiect.
And my iudgement further is, that all good
Catholikes ought to concurre with me herein,
and to doe the like. For this is my conſcience
and reſolution, that no lawfull Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be iuſtly denounced and publiſhed by
the Pope againſt his Maieſtie, which can or
ought (as I haue ſayd) to inculcate, command
or worke, and bring foorth any ſuch effects.
And that all his Maieſties Subiects, the ſame
notwithſtanding, (if any ſuch ſhould euer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)
doe ſtill continue as firmely obliged to his
Maiestie to all intents and purpoſes, as they
were euer obliged at any time before, or as if
ſuch an Excommunication had neuer beene
thought of, framed, denounced, or publiſhed.
And therefore not knowing whether euer I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22045:14"/>
ſhall haue opportunitie againe to write unto
you, I haue thus at large diſcharged my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in this matter: perſwading my ſelfe, that
you (my Aſſiſtants &amp; deare brethren) wil take
the oath, as I haue done, when it ſhall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto you; and that you will inſtruct the
lay Catholikes, that they may ſo doe, when it is
tendered them. So ſhall we ſhake off the falſe
and grieuous imputations of Treaſon, &amp; Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries:
So ſhall lay Catholikes not ouerthrow
their estates: ſo ſhall we effect that, which his
Holineſſe deſireth, that is, to exhibite our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to God and our Prince. Surely this will
bring us gaine, and increaſe of many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.
And ſo to conclude in the Apostle his
wordes, <hi>Charitas mea cum omnibus vobis

cauſed greater ſtrife: that the Secular

mooued, appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made
