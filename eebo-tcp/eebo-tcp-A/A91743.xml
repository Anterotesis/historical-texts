            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Conformity to your deſires ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by your Order unto me, I
here humbly preſent you a ſecond
time with that plain, but wholſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which you were lately pleaſed to
receive with all ready attention. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the argument is ſuch, as the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:115568:3"/>
thought need ful to inculcate once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
And therefore if the <hi>Tongue</hi> and the
<hi>Pen,</hi> the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Preſs,</hi> do a firſt
and a ſecond time invite you unto the
ſame duty, the Apoſtles example will
both commend your <hi>zeal</hi> in deſiring it,
and excuſe my <hi>obedience</hi> in conforming to
ſo juſt a deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self-ſufficiency</hi> is Gods peculiar honor,
one of thoſe <hi>Regalia</hi> which belong unto
him alone. All creatures muſt go out of
themſelves, both for the <hi>continuance</hi> of that
<hi>Being,</hi> which they have, and for the <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
of ſuch further <hi>good</hi> as they ſtand in
need of. And ſince they are all thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in them ſelves, they muſt needs be
unable to complete the perfections of one
another, much leſs of <hi>man,</hi> who is one of
the principal and moſt excellent of them.
That <hi>good</hi> therefore, the want whereof
doth kindle <hi>deſire,</hi> &amp; the fruition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth produce <hi>delight,</hi> muſt be ſought
above the world, in him, who as he is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to himſelf, ſo is he alone <hi>All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
unto his Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115568:3"/>
And becauſe there is no approach for
ſinful men unto God without a <hi>Mediator,</hi>
the Father hath ſet up his eternal ſon, as
that middle perſon, in whom we may have
communion with him, and acceſs unto
him. Juſtly therefore was the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi>
before his coming, ſtiled <hi>The Deſire of all
Nations;</hi> &amp; as juſtly is he, after his coming,
their everlaſting <hi>Delight,</hi> ſince in and by
him alone, the Lord is pleaſed to be at
peace with us, and out of his fulneſs to
communicate all good unto us. To ſet
forth this <hi>Preciouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> unto his
people, and to quicken their <hi>joy</hi> in him,
was the end of this Sermon, and is indeed
the end of all other.</p>
            <p>We live in changeable and uncompoſed
times; we ſee diſtempers at home, we hear
of diſtreſſes abroad; the Lord is ſhaking
heaven and earth, Churches and States;
our eyes and our experience tell us, how
mutable are the wills, how inconſtant the
Judgements, how fickle the favors, how
ſudden the frowns of men, how vain the
hopes, how unſtable the delights which
<pb facs="tcp:115568:4"/>
are drawn out of broken Ciſterns; how
full of droſs and dregs the moſt refined
contents of the world are. <hi>God alone is true
and every man a lyar,</hi> either by <hi>falſeneſs</hi>
deluding, or by <hi>weakneſs</hi> diſappointing
thoſe that depended on them.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the life of man doth
hardly deſerve the name of life, without
ſome ſolid <hi>comfort</hi> to ſupport it; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men nor Angels, much leſs honors or
pleaſures, plenty or abundance, can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
us with that <hi>Comfort;</hi> what remains,
but that we betake our ſelves unto that
<hi>Fountain of living water,</hi> whence alone it
is to be had? that we ſecure our intereſt
in the <hi>Lord</hi> Chriſt, who is <hi>faithful,</hi> and
cannot fail; <hi>powerful,</hi> and will not forſake,
nor expoſe thoſe that come unto God by
him? that ſo being upon the <hi>Rock which
is higher then our ſelves,</hi> we may be able
amidſt all the tempeſts and ſhakings, the
deluſions and diſappointments below, to
<hi>Rejoyce</hi> in him with a fixed and inconcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
delight, who can bring joy out of
ſorrow, light out of darkneſs, and turn
<pb facs="tcp:115568:4"/>
all confuſions into order and beauty.
This that you, and all Gods people in
City and Countrey may every where do,
is the prayer of</p>

               <signed>Your Honors moſt

of grace, rendring Chriſt by faith, <hi>preſent</hi> unto it;
whereby it is not only ſupported under all afflictions,
but enabled to glory in them, and to triumph over
them. 2. The difficulty of this joy intimated, in
that believers are ſo often invited unto it 3. The
<hi>ſureneſs</hi> and the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of it, noted in the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the words. 4. The <hi>ſtability</hi> and <hi>perpetuity</hi>
of it, They may rejoice alway in the midſt of their

6. The Apoſtolical <hi>atteſtation</hi> given unto it, <hi>Again

            <p>There are many things belonging unto the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

<hi>drawn from the</hi> Royal Office <hi>of</hi> Chriſt; Rejoice
greatly O daughter of Sion, ſhout O daughter of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
behold thy King cometh unto thee, he is juſt,
and having ſalvation, lowly, and riding upon an

in whom all bleſſings were to be made good unto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.
They had been <hi>ſervants</hi> under <hi>ſtrange Lords,

Their Governor was to <hi>proceed from the midſt of

there is nothing more acceptable to the people,

in works of Juſtice and proweſſe. Therefore,
4, Our King is here ſet forth <hi>riding:</hi> He did alwaies
<hi>go about doing of good,</hi> made it his meat and drink
to do his Fathers work: And here, when it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
moſt reaſonable for him to have drawn back and
ſpared himſelf, when he was to be crucified, he
ſhews his cheerfulneſs in that ſervice, by <hi>riding</hi> to
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about it, which we read not that he did
upon any other occaſion: He did <hi>earneſtly deſire
that Paſſover,</hi> he did ſeverely <hi>rebuke Peter</hi> when he
diſſwaded him from that work, he did expreſs his
ſingular readineſs to become a ſacrifice; <hi>Loe I come,
I delight to do thy will O God; yea thy Law is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mine heart, Pſal.</hi> 40. 7, 8. And though in his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he did earneſtly deſire that the <hi>cup might paſs

did greatly ſet forth the <hi>ſubmiſsion</hi> and <hi>willingneſs</hi>

ground of <hi>great joy</hi> to a people, when all other
Princely endowments in their Soveraign, are vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
acted and improved for their ſafety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115568:14"/>
when they ſee him deny himſelf in his own

this is the Crown of his Peoples <hi>Joy,</hi> That they
have not only a <hi>juſt,</hi> a <hi>valiant,</hi> an <hi>humble,</hi> an <hi>active,</hi>
but a <hi>proſperous</hi> and ſucceſsfull Prince, making his

the yoke of their burden, the ſtaff of their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the rod of their oppreſſor, extending peace to
them like a River, and the glory of the Gentiles like
a flowing ſtream, cauſing them to put their feet on

the necks of their adverſaries. Thus, many waies
are the people of Chriſt encouraged to rejoice in
him.</p>
            <p>This then ſerveth, 1. To reprove the ſin and folly
of all thoſe who ſeek for joy out of the broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns
of the Creatures, which can hold none, and
leave that living fountain out of which it naturally
floweth. Some ſeek it in ſecular wealth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
others in ſenſual pleaſures, feaſting, gaming,
luxury, exceſs; ſome in Titles of Honor, others
in variety of knowledge, ſome in ſtately Structures,
magnificent retinue, goodly proviſions; others in
low, ſordid, and bruitiſh luſts. Unto all whom we
may ſay as the Angel unto the women, <hi>Luke 24. 5.
Why ſeek ye the living amongſt the dead;</hi> or as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>

vanity <hi>alone,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> in a maſs and <hi>collection,</hi>
vanity <hi>together,</hi> enough to vex the ſoul, enough to

2. This diſcovereth the great ſin and folly of

many things belonging unto Chriſt, which the

and <hi>Greeks,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. Thoſe pitching in their
expectations upon a glorious Prince, who ſhould
free them from the Roman yoke, could not endure
to be ſo diſappointed, as in the ſtead thereof to have
a crucified man, one in the form of a ſervant to be
their <hi>Meſsiah;</hi> and therefore whoſoever rule over
them, he ſhall not, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 4. Theſe, judging it
a fooliſh thing to expect <hi>life</hi> from a <hi>dead</hi> man, <hi>glory</hi>
and <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> from one who did not keep himſelf
from <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>curſe,</hi> hearing doctrines wholly
diſſonant and inconſiſtent with the principles they
had been prepoſſeſſed withal, did thereupon refuſe
to ſubmit to Chriſt; who notwithſtanding, to them
which are called, was the power of God, and the
wiſdom of God; had more power then that which
the Jews require, more wiſdom then that which
the Greeks ſought after. The <hi>Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

is matter of <hi>offence</hi> unto many others, called <hi>the
offence of the Croſs,</hi> Gal. 5. 11. When they hear that
they muſt ſuffer with him, if they will reign with
him; that through many tribulations they muſt
enter into the Kingdom of God; that affliction is
an appendix to the Goſpel, and find the truth of it
by experience (perſecution ariſing becauſe of the
word) then <hi>preſently they are offended,</hi> Matth.

            <p>3. Others are offended at the <hi>Free-grace</hi> of Chriſt,
cannot endure to be ſhut out from all ſhare and
cauſality towards their own ſalvation. Thus the
<hi>Iews</hi> not willing to ſeek righteouſneſs by faith in
Chriſt, but as it were by the works of the Lavv,
<hi>ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone,</hi>

            <p>4. It noteth <hi>Hardneſs</hi> and contumacy in ſin: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

And this is indeed a right dangerous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for where Chriſt is not for the <hi>riſing,</hi> he is
for the <hi>fall</hi> of men; where his ſweet favour is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving,
it is deadly: That ſickneſs, of all other, is

            <p>3. We ſhould therefore be exhorted unto this ſo

            </p>

of which, the Apoſtle eſteemed all other
things <hi>as loſs and dung,</hi> Phil. 3. 8.</p>
            <p>4. In all <hi>the means</hi> which he hath appointed to

And this your work of faith, and labour of love,

of ſuch as bear evil will to the proſperity

in all places at home, and I perſwade my ſelf

not but it will be a rejoycing and a crown unto you
at the appearing of the Lord. And truly your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>

ſo it is the joy of believers to do his work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
12. they live not, they die not unto themſelves, but

of faith, Phil.</hi> 1. 25. not only in regard of the good
things it aſſureth unto us, but of the efficacy which
it hath in us, inabling us to work by love.</p>
            <p>7. In the <hi>light</hi> of his countenance ſhining on us,
which is much <hi>better then life it ſelf; Pſal.</hi> 63. 3.
We may all ſay unto him, as he ſaid unto his Father,
<hi>Acts 2. 28. Thou ſhalt make me full of joy with thy
countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. In the <hi>hope of his glory:</hi> The ſpirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is even now a glorious thing, <hi>John 1. 2. But it
doth not yet appear what we ſhall be,</hi> only this he hath
aſſured us of, That we ſhall be <hi>like unto him,</hi> ſhall
<hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> ſhall <hi>appear with him in glory;</hi> ſhall
<hi>ſit upon his Throne,</hi> and <hi>be ever with him; 1 John</hi> 3
1, 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. And this bleſſed hope, ſecured by the
witneſs of the ſpirit (who is the ſeal and earneſt of
our eternal inheritance) filleth the hearts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
with <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> while
they look not on the things that are ſeen, but on
the things that are not ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:115568:21"/>
9. In the <hi>fellowſhip of his ſufferings,</hi> which
though to <hi>ſenſe</hi> they be matter of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> yet unto
<hi>faith</hi> are they matter of <hi>joy.</hi> When Gods ſervants
conſider, that unto theſe ſufferings they were <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi>
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 3. That Chriſt owns them <hi>as his,
Col.</hi> 1. 4. That they <hi>work</hi> for them <hi>a far more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and eternal weight of glory, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 17. That
thereby the <hi>ſpirit of glory reſteth on them,</hi> and that
God himſelf is <hi>glorified</hi> in them: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. In
theſe reſpects they not only rejoice, but triumph as
<hi>more then conquerors</hi> in all their afflictions, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41
<hi>Rom. 8. 37. Iam.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>Thus are Believers to rejoice in Chriſt: And
that, 1. <hi>Greatly,</hi> again and again. Other delights
may pleaſe the ſenſes, tickle the fancy; gratifie the
reaſon; but there is no joy that can <hi>fill all the heart,</hi>
but the <hi>joy of the Lord, Zeph.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Alway:</hi> Rejoice <hi>ever more, 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 16.
all other joies have their periods and vacations, they
flow and ebb, they bloſſom and wither: In a fit of
ſickneſs, in a pang of conſcience, under a ſentence
of death, they are all as the white of an egg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſavor. But no condition is imaginable,
wherein a conſcionable believer hath not a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of joy in Chriſt: This Tree of life hath fruit on
it <hi>for every month, Rev.</hi> 21. 2. The comforter he
ſends abides with us <hi>for ever, Iohn</hi> 14. 16. The joy
he gives, <hi>none can take away, Iohn</hi> 16. 22. Though
Gods people have many cauſes of <hi>ſorrow in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
ſtrong corruptions, hard hearts, little ſtrength,
weak graces, many temptations; yet in <hi>Chriſt</hi> they
have ſtill matter of <hi>rejoicing;</hi> in the conſtancy of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115568:22"/>
his <hi>love,</hi> in the abundance of his pardoning <hi>mercy,</hi>
in the fulneſs of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in the ſufficiency of his
<hi>grace,</hi> in the fidelity of his <hi>promiſe,</hi> in the validity
of his <hi>purchaſe,</hi> in the vigilancy of his <hi>eye,</hi> in the
readines of his <hi>help,</hi> in the perpetuity of his <hi>interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
we diſparage ſo good a Lord, diſcredit his ſervice,
diſquiet our ſelves, diſcourage others, grieve his ſpirit,
expoſe his waies to prejudice &amp; reproach, weaken our
hands in his ſervice and our hearts in his love, when
we pine and languiſh under groundleſs perplexity,
and waſte that time which ſhould be ſpent in his
work, about our jealouſies of his favor.</p>
            <p>3. With <hi>trembling</hi> and holy reverence, <hi>Res ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
eſt verum gaudium,</hi> without levity, without wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs,
without preſumption, without arrogance,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. So rejoice in him, as withall to fear to
offend him, to work out our own ſalvation <hi>with fear
and trembling;</hi> even for this very reaſon, becauſe he
is ſo gracious as to give us both, to will and to do of
his own good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>4. With improvement of this joy: 1. Unto
<hi>thankfulneſs</hi> for Chriſt, and any thing of Chriſt in
our ſelves,<note place="margin">In eundem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem non luto Convenire Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium &amp; ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. Pacatus in Panegyr.</note> having taſted that the Lord is gracious,
let us ever be ſpeaking good of his name; though
our meaſures are not ſo great as ſome other mens,
yet we may not eſteem any thing of ſalvation ſmall,
or little; it will grow unto perfection.</p>
            <p>2. Unto more <hi>chearful ſervice,</hi> the more we tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in his <hi>victory,</hi> the more we ſhall <hi>abound</hi> in
his <hi>work, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 57, 58. The joy of the Lord is
our ſtrength, <hi>Nehem. 8. 10. Return to thy reſt, O my
ſoul;</hi> there is <hi>Davids</hi> joy, <hi>I will walk before the Lord;</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:115568:22"/>
there is the work of that joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 8, 9. None
are more <hi>fruitfull</hi> in his <hi>ſervice,</hi> then they who are
moſt <hi>joifull</hi> in his <hi>favor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Unto conſolation againſt any other evils, though
we have not the wealth, health, gifts, imployments,
honors that others have; yet if Chriſt have given
us himſelf, his bloud to redeem us, his ſpirit to
quicken us, his grace to renew us, his peace to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us; Should ſuch <hi>conſolations ſeem ſmall unto
us? Iob</hi> 15. 11. What <hi>wants</hi> are there which the
<hi>joy</hi> of the Lord doth not compenſate? What ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are there which the <hi>joy</hi> of the Lord doth not
ſwallow up? Would we exchange Chriſt if we might
have all the world without him? And ſhall we be
diſpleaſed if we have not all the world with him?
Nay have we not in him all other things more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
ſweetly, purely, richly to enjoy, then in all
the creatures beſides? <hi>Fidelibus totus mundus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiarum
eſt.</hi> Doth thy journey to heaven diſpleaſe
thee, becauſe the way haply is deep and ſtony? ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it were a Carpit-way like <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain, haply
there thou wouldſt loiter more, haply there thou
wouldſt be more aſſaulted, whereas in a deeper way
thou art more careful of thy ſelf, and more ſecure
againſt thine enemies.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, unto a zealous <hi>provocation</hi> of others to
come in and be partakers of the ſame joy. In times
of feſtivity, men uſe to <hi>call their neighbours under
their Vines and Fig-trees, Zach.</hi> 3. 10. The Lord
Jeſus is the <hi>feaſt</hi> of his ſervants, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8. unto
him therefore we ſhould invite one another, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>
did <hi>Simon,</hi> and <hi>Philip Nathaniel, Iohn</hi> 1. 41, 45.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115568:23"/>
Joy is of all affections the moſt communicative, it
leaps out into the eyes, the feet, the tongue, ſtaies
not in one privat boſom, but as it is able, ſheds it
ſelf abroad into the boſoms of many others.<note place="margin">Non ſe capit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantis laetitiae magnitudo, ſed deſignata p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

in the Ark of God as well as he, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 14.
19. I ſhall ſhut up all with removing two obſtacles
which ſeem to ſtand in the way of this <hi>joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If I muſt <hi>alway rejoice,</hi> how then, or when,
ſhall I <hi>ſorrow for ſin?</hi> I anſwer, Theſe two doe
ſweetly conſiſt. As the Paſſeover was a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> yet
eaten with <hi>bitter hearbs,</hi> ſo Chriſt our Paſſeover
may be <hi>feaſted</hi> upon with a <hi>bitter ſenſe</hi> of our own
ſins. As in the Spring many a ſweet flowre falls,
and yet the Sun ſhines all the while: So there may
be ſweet flowres of Godly ſorrow, and the Sun of
righteouſneſs ſtill ſhine on the ſoul. None do more
mourn for offending Chriſt, then thoſe who do moſt
rejoice in the fruition of him.</p>
            <p>2. But what ſhall we ſay of <hi>wounded and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
conſciences,</hi> lying under the buffets of Satan,
under divine deſertions, ſinking under temptation,
and wreſtling with the ſenſe and fear of wrath, can
theſe rejoice at all, much leſs always? It is true, <hi>when
God hides his face, none can behold him,</hi> in ſuch a
ſhipwrack neither Sun nor Stars wil appear. But yet,</p>
            <p>1. There is the matter and foundation of true
<hi>joy,</hi> the ſeed of comfort <hi>Light is ſown for the
righteous, and joy for the upright in heart, Pſa.</hi> 97. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115568:23"/>
2. Theſe <hi>ſorrows</hi> are many times <hi>preparations</hi> for
more joy, as the ſorrow of a <hi>travailing woman,
Joh.</hi> 16. 20. black roots bear beautiful flowres:
The Whale that ſwallowed <hi>Jonah,</hi> carried him to
the ſhore. Dark colours make way to an overlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of gold. The more a ſtone is <hi>wounded by</hi> the
hand of the engraver, the more <hi>beauty</hi> is ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
upon it. Many times where the Lord intends
moſt comfort, he doth uſher it in with more ſorrow;
as the Angel firſt <hi>lamed Iacob,</hi> and then <hi>bleſſed</hi> him.</p>
            <p>3. This very eſtate is far more elegible then the
pleaſures of ſin, and therefore hath more delight in
it. If you ſhould ask an holy man in this caſe, you
ſee how ſeverely Chriſt deals with you: Will you
not rather give over ſerving him, lamenting after
him, languiſhing for want of him, and reſume your
wonted delights of ſin again? What other anſwer
would a good ſoul give, but as Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Get
thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me.</hi>
Though there be little reaſon that he ſhould <hi>comfort</hi>
me, yet there is great reaſon that I ſhould <hi>ſerve</hi> him.
The wounds of <hi>Ghriſt</hi> are better then the <hi>kiſſe</hi> of
the <hi>world;</hi> it is much better being with a <hi>frowning
fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi> then with a flattering foe. The <hi>worſt</hi> eſtate
of a <hi>Saint</hi> is better then the <hi>beſt</hi> of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> the
bittereſt <hi>Phyſick,</hi> then ſweeteſt <hi>poyſon.</hi> As in the
midſt of <hi>worldly laughter the heart is ſorrowful;</hi>
ſo in the midſt of ſaddeſt Temptations, the ſoul
ſtill concludes, <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to
Chriſt.</hi> Let him deny me, let him delay me, let him
deſert me, let him deſtroy me, yet I will love him,
and deſire him ſtill. As the blackeſt day is lighter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115568:24"/>
then the brighteſt night; ſo the ſaddeſt day of a
believer is more <hi>joyous</hi> then the ſweeteſt night of a

            <p>We have thus conſidered the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> as a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
a <hi>precious,</hi> a <hi>full,</hi> a <hi>pure,</hi> a <hi>rare,</hi> a <hi>various,</hi> a
