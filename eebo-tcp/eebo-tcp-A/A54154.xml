         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Duty I ow to Almighty God,
and the Reſpect I bear to his
Truth, with that great Concern which
lives in my Mind for your better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

our Principles (miſ-given here, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

I have to purſue this tedious and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Controverſie.</p>
            <p>And that you might be undeceived of
thoſe falſe Apprehenſions, vulgar Stories
or the Inſinuations of more prevalent
Agents have impreſt you with, I could
(God knows) be contented, that even
Sufferings were added to my Labours.
<pb facs="tcp:41053:3"/>
What would I not cheerfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
to win you into a ſerious View and
impartial Conſideration of our Caſe!
Truly, I have that Belief of many of
you, that were the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and common <hi>Vogue</hi> of the World
ſet aſide, you would do us ſome Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
And I beſeech you, weigh how
much it becomes you, <hi>you, the ſerious
Profeſſors of Religion,</hi> to give us a fair
Hearing for our Principles and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
before you finally determine
any thing againſt us. To <hi>Try all
things</hi> was an Apoſtolical Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Nor can you eſcape the Cenſure
of Diſ-regarding it, if you decline a
fair Inquiery after us? Let not <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
be dearer to you then <hi>Truth;</hi> and
ſee if more be not to be known by
you then yet you know. <hi>Objected
Novelty</hi> ought to have no Force with
a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſince had that prevailed,
he had never been one: Nor ſhould the

the God of Truth, when manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Fleſh, was not exempted
from more of that then ever yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
us; Indeed it ſhould rather
be an Argument for us.</p>
            <p>Believe us, we intreat you, when
we tell you, that Religion, <hi>Pure and
Vndefiled Religion,</hi> we greatly love;
'Tis that we deſire as well to Live as
Defend: God knows, we have long
made it the Bent of our Hearts, and
the whole Aim of our Lives; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Yet how are we Defamed, Underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
Contemned and ſet at Nought,
for a Company of <hi>Seducers, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Idolaters,</hi> and what not? But
why? becauſe we are not underſtood,
and as cunningly (by ſome) hindred
from being ſo. But therefore is this
Diſcourſe more particularly Dedicated
<pb facs="tcp:41053:4"/>
to you, that you may be both acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>THis <hi>Controverſie,</hi> not of Choice, but abſolute
Neceſſity, thus continued (and which hath
ſwell'd this <hi>Rejoynder</hi> beyond both my Deſire
and Expectation, through ſuch great Provocations and
multiplyed Wrongs, as are utterly inconſiſtent with
the Honour of Truth to put up, and which require our
ſerious Notice in its Defence) was begun by <hi>J. Faldo,</hi>
a <hi>Non-conforming Miniſter at</hi> Barnet, in a large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
entituled, QUAKERISM NO CHRISTIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY
(diſguſted, as I have heard, at the coming
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41053:9"/>
over of ſome of his Hearers to the Way we profeſs) in
which he not only accuſed us of the Blackeſt Errors, but
pretended to prove every Charge out of our own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
an <hi>Eſſay</hi> none had ever yet fallen on beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
At what Rate ſoever he proved them, certain it
is, he charged us home, and managed it with Equal
Diſingenuity. This, it was my Lot to anſwer, which I
did in a Book, call'd QUAKERISM <hi>a New Nick-Name
for Old</hi> CHRISTIANITY, &amp;c. Chiefly intending by
it to diſcover, how groſly he had miſtaken our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and unworthily perverted thoſe Words we had
employed to maintain them; and finally, to confirm
our true Sence with the Authority of holy Scriptures:
Unto which he has ventured to give us a <hi>Reply,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
that he might not be thought to have nothing to ſay,
ſo little hath he ſaid to the Purpoſe, <hi>which is already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Diſcourſe of the Moderate, and Regret of his
Party;</hi> But what he wants of <hi>Solidity,</hi> he fills up with
<hi>Air,</hi> and places his <hi>Reflections</hi> to the Account of <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and when he comes to a Pinch, he gives us
<hi>Confidence</hi> for <hi>Evidence,</hi> attended moſt commonly with
a Rout of <hi>hard Names,</hi> to drive it more forcibly home.
And truly herein he has deceiv'd me; for I muſt needs
ſay, I did not take him to be one that would withſtand
ſuch manifeſt Conviction, and that with no other then
Froth, Rant, and very Obſtinacy: I hop'd that when I had
given him a Serious Anſwer to his Book, he would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have ingenuouſly acknowledged his Miſtake of
our Writings, with this Satisfaction, that he found
us not ſo <hi>Heterodox</hi> as he apprehended us to be; or
elſe have beſtowed upon us ſuch a ſober and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Reply,</hi> as might have ſufficiently proved our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41053:9"/>
Error, and juſtified his own Undertaking: But inſtead
thereof, behold a <hi>Pamphlet ſtuffed with Rage and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Abuſe!</hi> by him entituled, <hi>A Vindication;</hi> but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>his Condemnation with God and all Good Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſeems to have deſerted the Matter, as giving that
for gone; and under pretence of anſwering my Book,
fully payes himſelf of my Perſon. Of that he has no
Mercy; I am all that a Man ſwelled with Paſſion, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and Revenge can character me to be.</p>
               <p>He complains much, <hi>yet himſelf is the Injurer; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi>
he layes at my Door, <hi>and 'tis his own beloved Crime;</hi>
He ſayes I boaſt of Victory, <hi>yet</hi> John Faldo <hi>is the
great Crack;</hi> Where I rebuke his Froth, he returns me
<hi>Railing;</hi> and if I improve his own <hi>Similes</hi> againſt him,
then <hi>Diſingenuous W. P.</hi> Devotion he fleers at, as if it
were <hi>an old-faſhioned thing;</hi> My Reprehenſion of his
Ill-Language, he counts intollerable; <hi>Is this your Meek
Chriſtian,</hi> ſayes he? making it a greater Sin in me to
Defend my ſelf, <hi>then in him to Accuſe me;</hi> Perſonal and
Princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Reflections run fluently through his firſt
Book; <hi>My Reproof</hi> of that unprovoakt Aſperity, <hi>he
ſtorms at,</hi> and will needs have it to be <hi>Reviling;</hi> and
inſtead of Repenting of his ill beginning with us, he hath
greatly encreaſed his ſcore, by a more <hi>Scurrilous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;</hi>
as if the Man's Buſineſs were not to make us Better,
<hi>but prove and juſtifie his own being Worſe.</hi> He would
make us in Love with our Errors, if ſuch we held, that
uſes ſo ill a Way to reclaim us. Does he think we are
to be <hi>Jeered</hi> or <hi>Railed</hi> out of our Religion? No, No.
In his <hi>firſt,</hi> he went too far; In his <hi>ſecond</hi> he has done
little elſe. What ſhall we ſay of thoſe, whoſe Pride
has brought them to ſuch a pitch of Paſſion, that <hi>Rage</hi>

out breaking one part of the Law of Modeſty, I may
ſay (for I know) he is irrecoverably gone in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<hi>Not one Charge can he prove,</hi> nor one Friend of
ours can he make to ſpeak to his Purpoſe. He was for
having us to <hi>aſſaſſinate our ſelves;</hi> our Friends he would
fain have <hi>to turn Executioners to their own Principles.</hi>
This <hi>Fool's Paradiſe</hi> pleaſed him; but the Diſcreet know
and think better: Some were ſtartled at the Pretences of
the firſt, wherein nothing leſs then our <hi>own Books</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to bear Witneſs againſt us, who are now great Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
of his Injuſtice and Railing. Bleſſed be God for
that Good Succeſs; we hope the like of our following
Endeavours. I have for the ſake of ſuch as expect an
Anſwer, ſent forth this <hi>Rejoynder;</hi> wherein ſeveral weighty
Points are as clearly handled, as Time, Place, and other
Occaſions would permit. It greatly concerns all to be fully
ſatisfied therein: And I hope, there is enough ſaid for
all Impartial Readers to reap that Benefit. I ſeek no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
I aim not at Reputation, God is Record: neither
has he done enough to raiſe up the One, or queſtion the
Other; yet he has done doubtleſs what he could, and
I muſt take the <hi>Will for the Deed.</hi> I ſhall not ſhow my ſelf
ſo Perſonally concerned in this <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> as his Perſonal
Reflections would make me; 'tis below the Spirit of a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Man to be diſturbed by ſuch Barks of Malice;
Curs, yelping at the Moon, neither queſtions nor ecclipſes
her Light: 'Tis a ſort of <hi>Suffering I muſt expect to undergo;</hi>
and the beſt is, I find little Difficulty in it. And though I
ſhall not cite all his Injuſtice towards me, for that were
well nigh to tranſcribe his Book; yet that which may be
requiſite to give a further Reliſh of this pretended <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
may be done in its proper place. In the mean time
I ſhall betake my ſelf to the Conſideration of ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41053:10"/>
in his <hi>Reply,</hi> as may be thought to call for my
<hi>Rejoynder,</hi> and that without thoſe <hi>inſolent Checks,
frequent Abuſes, and very vain and gingling Taunts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
has cramb'd his Pamphlet with:</hi> For I can ſuffer that my
ſelf, I cannot let the Truth ſuffer. Nor can I think
my Silence to his Revilings the worſt Anſwer, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when <hi>my Religion will not allow of a like Return
in Vindication:</hi> For though Scoffs and Abuſive Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may diſcredit an <hi>Adverſary</hi> with the Weak or
Prejudiced, yet with a Serious <hi>Reader,</hi> ſuch rather
pollute, then defend a Cauſe. I will leave the whole
Honour of that Way of Confutation to my <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi>
not being in ſuch Neceſſity for Conqueſt, as to
take that Diſhonourable and Diſhoneſt Way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
it. If I can make my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> a little more
intelligible, then he has done his <hi>Reply,</hi> defend the Truth
I own and honour, ſo as to anſwer my <hi>Reader's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
I ſhall have obtain'd my whole End; and
maugre the Impetuous and bluſtering Humour of a
few <hi>Enraged Adverſaries, my Mind will ſweetly reſt
in Peace with God,</hi> in whom I have believed, and
for whoſe Cauſe only I am thus warmly concerned in
the World.</p>

<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> this Man has not undertaken Eight
Lines to reply to, neither are thoſe the Strength of my

                  <p>To conclude, I dare not repute Enoch to be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,

<hi>Whatſoever things are True, Honeſt, Juſt, Pure, Lovely,

is no Part of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> or, <hi>that a Man may be a Saint

that it ſhould be reported that we believe the <hi>Word nigh

Power, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, that then ſo ſuper-excellently

all former Ages, as Mankind was in a Capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it; wherefore the Difference lay in the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>One Thing neceſſary,</hi> and not in ſeveral

of the Goſpel to make People <hi>Tame</hi> and not <hi>Wild;</hi>
Sufferers, not Hectors; but ſuch Expreſſions very well

is not ſo ſeared, but I can feel and reſent <hi>John Faldo</hi>'s
Injuſtice. God knows I left out no words deſignedly;
nor could the Inſertion of them have diſappointed me:
For if the Thing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> may be before the Name
a Day, then a Year, and ſo an Age, till we ſhall come
to the firſt Man that ever God ſaved. All Men muſt be
ſaved by either Law or Goſpel; Now the <hi>Law</hi> ſtrictly
conſidered, <hi>could never ſave,</hi> it gives Life to none: So
imports the Scripture, and ſo aſſerts B. <hi>Vſher,</hi> B. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,
Allen,</hi> and others; then it muſt have been by
the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is by the Apoſtle called the <hi>Power of
God unto Salvation:</hi> and if all Men that were ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
were ſaved by the Goſpel, then <hi>True Chriſtians;</hi>
unleſs Men may believe the Goſpel, be ſaved by the
Life and Power of it, and yet be <hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> that
is, not the Men, the term <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (given firſt at
<hi>Antioch</hi>) doth fignifie. I ſhall offer this ſhort <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to the Reader's conſideration. <hi>If He</hi> that is
born again, <hi>be a Chriſtian, and ſuch,</hi> as enter into the
Kingdom of God, <hi>be born again,</hi> then <hi>becauſe</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iſaac, Jacob, Samuel, David, &amp;c. <hi>entered into God's
Kingdom,</hi> it follows, <hi>that they were born again,</hi> and
conſequently <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> How pernicious is that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which denyes the <hi>New Birth</hi> to be ſo much as any
part of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> when, indeed, the greateſt, as Chriſt's
own Saying proves.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of the Matter is, <hi>The very Life, Power

<hi>E. Burroughs</hi>'s and <hi>J. Whitehead</hi>'s words at length, and

of his Quotations, from whence he concluded <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm
No Chriſtianity.</hi> Hear my Anſwer, and by that it

<q>Well, But when came this <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> into the World?
He tells us,<note place="margin">pag. 21, 22.</note> about the year 1651.
quoting <hi>E. B</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtle</hi> before <hi>G. F</hi>'s
<hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> alſo a ſmall Treatiſe writ by <hi>John
Whitehead &amp; Iſaac Penington;</hi> from whence he infers,
that <hi>Quakeriſm is a late Diſpenſation,</hi> therefore not
<hi>that</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> But certainly, this Man hath
taken a very Quick Courſe to <hi>Vnchriſtian</hi> himſelf,
and all the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents</hi> and <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
in the World, as well as the <hi>Quakers:</hi> For I
would ask him, if there was not a Time ſince the
Primitive Age, wherein Darkneſs hath overſpread
the Earth, the Beaſt did Reign, and the pure Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was wholely Wilderneſs'd? If ſo, conſequently
the <hi>Reſurrection of Truth</hi> is no more a New Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
or not that of <hi>Chriſtianity, then a Man that
is exiled his Country, is not eſſentially the ſame Man,
when he returns, that he was before</hi>—But ſince we are
of another <hi>Religion</hi> by his Account, then the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
becauſe we cannot ſay that we were alwayes
ſucceſſively from the Apoſtles time, I will argue, that
the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are
<hi>not Chriſtians,</hi> nor is what they profeſs to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe they cannot prove a regular
Succeſſion from the Apoſtles Times, their date alſo
being of later years. What will they ſay then? The
<hi>Church</hi> was fled into the Wilderneſs; <hi>Truth</hi> exiled;
<hi>God</hi> as a Stranger in the Earth; yet <hi>Truth</hi> ſtill the
ſame in it ſelf: Very well, ſo ſay we. God was
pleaſed to renew the Right <hi>Chriſtian</hi>- Diſpenſation to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41053:14"/>
us, and by us, according to <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion, that the
Everlaſting Goſpel was preached <hi>again,</hi> intimating,
<hi>that there had been a Time wherein it was not preached.</hi>
If this be not a New Goſpel, becauſe anew or again
preached; neither is that which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> calls <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm</hi>
a New Diſpenſation, becauſe it is <hi>preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> to the Sons of Men; which
is God's Power inwardly manifeſted for the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Converſion, Redemption and Salvation of the Souls
of ſuch as believe in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I take in that part of the <hi>Quotation</hi>
which was material to the proving of <hi>Quakeriſm No
Chriſtianity,</hi> at leaſt in my Adverſary's Apprehenſion.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> I have Anſwered that <hi>Objection,</hi> both by
ſhowing that the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi>
whom he owns to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> were novil; and
that the Everlaſting Goſpel was to be preached <hi>again;</hi>
which implyed, that a Time there was in which it was
not preached; conſequently, that his <hi>Objection</hi> could not
be therefore of any Force, as levelled at us: To all which
he ſayes nothing, only asks a Queſtion concerning my
Reproof for his want of Candor in explaining <hi>I. Pening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
words, <hi>viz.</hi> As if <hi>Penington,</hi> who was a Schollar,
could not expreſs his Mind Congruouſly, but muſt have

of <hi>Moſes, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Apoſtles,</hi> and THIS
<hi>of our Day,</hi> as if they had been three ſeveral Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
and conſequently, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not that of

                        <hi>J. P.</hi> means not a Diſtinct
Adminiſtration in Kind, but Diſpenſation of one and
the ſame Light, Life and Power by Nature, at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

<hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>before</hi> the Law, <hi>under</hi> the Law, <hi>with</hi> the

will it therefore follow, he was not Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to that Appearance? or He, that appeared then

Or becauſe of a Difference in Manifeſtation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>not</hi> the ſame H E (through all thoſe ſeveral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations)

Unjuſt to <hi>J. P.</hi> eſpecially, when the Words above
quoted, that ſpeak of a Diſpenſation he experienced
a little before God broke forth by us, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
could have informed him, that he meant the
Divers Breakings forth of God's Light and Truth, in
order to the full Diſcovery and Recovery of Loſt
Primitive <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> So that this preſent Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
ſwallowing up all going before it (had he ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it, as he doth not, and therefore wronged) is no
more then God's <hi>Retriving to us the Ancient Goſpel,
with Additional Bleſſings and Aſſiſtances,</hi> giving us
the ſame <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> they had, and what elſe
he pleaſed by way of Improvement; which alters not
the Nature, no more then a Child in Chriſt is not
that Numerical Creature, but another Diſtinct Being,
when a Man.</q>

                  <p>Now can any Underſtanding Man account my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary's

                  <p>To wind up this, which more particularly concerns
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I ſay, That there never was but one <hi>True

Lord from Heaven, called, the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> and
<hi>Quickening Spirit:</hi> To deny this were to overturn the

and Irreverent <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> exclude the Life, Doctrine
and Miracles of Chriſt from any ſhare in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
becauſe, ſayes he, its dated with more reaſon, <hi>from
Chriſt's Reſurrection</hi> (and conſequently <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
before but an extraordinary kind of <hi>Jew</hi>) we muſt
needs conclude that as the tendency of Chriſt's Life
and Miracles was to preach, live and confirm his divine
Doctrine; ſo the very bent of that Doctrine was the
<hi>Improvement and Perfection of that Righteouſneſs,</hi> which
in former Ages was but begun, and more imperfectly
manifeſted: ſo that <hi>to be under Grace</hi> is not to live in
the Breach of God's Law Uncondemned through
Chriſt's perſonal Obedience wrought wholely without
us, but <hi>to be led to deny all that Vngodlineſs and</hi> thoſe
<hi>Worldly Luſts,</hi> for which the Law takes hold upon the
World, according to the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note>
                     <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that
are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the
Fleſh but after the Spirit</hi> (implying, that who walked
after the Fleſh were ſo long not under Grace, but under
Condemnation; Again,) <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of
Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of
Sin and Death</hi> (that is, not only from <hi>Death,</hi> the Wages,
but from <hi>Sin,</hi> the Work that leads to it; yet further)
<hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through
the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fleſh, and for Sin condemned Sin in the Fleſh, that
the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in vs,
who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit.</hi> So
that to be under Grace is to be under the Government &amp;
Leadings of it, and to enjoy that divine Power, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41053:17"/>
fulfills the Law, and redeems from thoſe Corruptions,
which prove men rather to be alive without Law, then
under Grace that fulfils it. Upon the whole; ſince ſome
in all Ages have been taught to deny Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12.</note>
and to live godly, and that they could
not ſo have done without the Grace that brings
Salvation; And ſince the Seed of the Serpent has been
bruiſed in them, and that it could not be without
Chriſt, the promiſed Seed; and ſince ſuch were then
turned from Darkneſs unto Light, and from Satan's
Power unto God; and that all this is purely Goſpel and
<hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſomething of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was in the World
before that viſible Appearance of Chriſt, from whoſe
Name the true Religion was ſo called: For though
there have been Diverſities of Gifts, yet the ſame Spirit;
though Difference of Adminiſtration, yet the ſame Lord.</p>
                  <p>And though God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</note> who <hi>at ſundry times</hi> and
<hi>in divers manners</hi> ſpake in times paſt to the
Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto us by his Son, yet he was <hi>the ſame God,</hi> who
ſpoak by the Prophets, that ſpoak by the Son, though
it is always confeſt, not in ſo plain, expreſs and excellent
a manner: the Difference therefore lay in the Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
rather then in the Thing manifeſted. For through
all Generations, there has been but one Seed, Truth,
Grace, Word, Life, Power or Spirit, by which any
of the Sons and Daughters of Men were ever ſaved;
and conſequently <hi>J. Faldo</hi> has greatly <hi>wrong'd</hi> the true
<hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Religion, as well as <hi>contradicted</hi> the Ancient
Writers, and <hi>abuſed</hi> us in dating <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from the

I have particularly anſwered the <hi>latter,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes

ſhall contract it thus, <q>No man that believes

Light;</hi> That <hi>every Man is enlightened by
Him;</hi> and that <hi>by Him who is called Light, all things
are upheld:</hi> And that <hi>He alone is Saviour;</hi>
                     </q> A Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> teaches, pag. 84, 85, 89. That we
never did aſſert, that the <hi>God that made Heaven and
Earth was comprehendible within the Soul of Man;</hi>
yet that he gave Light to the Soul of Man. To
which with much more he returns us <hi>not one word of
Anſwer,</hi> but would make People believe, it has been
the courſe I have taken with him. To conclude, He
muſt either deny <hi>Chriſt to have all Power in Heaven and
Earth, to be the True Eternal God;</hi> or that <hi>He who has
that Power, and is that God, is not that True Light that
enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> or
his Labour is but very <hi>Vanity,</hi> whoſe Wages will be
Vexation of Spirit. But thus far we are well aſſured,
that <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> for all his Shews of Reverence to the
Scripture, overturns the moſt evident Teſtimonies
therein contained, by withſtanding and defaming this
one Aſſertion, that <hi>God, who is Light, ſhines not in the
Heart of any Man on the Earth, nor ever did;</hi> For
what elſe can be the Conſequence of his decrying <hi>our
Principle,</hi> that aſſerts <hi>Chriſt to be the univerſal Light,
enlightning every Man that comes into the World;</hi> or that
<hi>the Light wherewith every Man is enlightned is not Chriſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41053:18"/>
or God?</hi> I affirm, that which quarrels this Principle would
not in the very ground have <hi>Chriſt to be God,</hi> indeed <hi>not
God to be God;</hi> ſeeing it is an utter Denyal of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni-preſence,
ſince God is not manifeſted but by his own
Light, and he being every where, his Light cannot be
limited, becauſe it cannot be diſtinguiſhed from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                  <p>This is nothing to the purpoſe; the Streſs lies
here, <hi>The Word of God being a Title given to Chriſt,</hi> as
the Title <hi>King</hi> is to a <hi>ſupreme Magiſtrate,</hi> whether it
be Reverent or Significant to call the <hi>Declaration</hi>

therefore decline to give that Title to any thing below
Chriſt himſelf, to whom the Scriptures moſt emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
aſcribe it.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe I ſaid that it might be the Word of Advice,
Reproof, Inſtruction,<note place="margin">pag. 28.</note> which Chriſt the Great
Word of God livingly ſows in the Hearts of

                  <p>I need not have done ſo for any ſuch Reaſon,
ſince Chriſt may in a ſenſe as well be Choaked, as by Sin
afreſh Crucified, and the Spirit Quenched. Nor could
<hi>unfruitful</hi> obliege me to give away the Cauſe, ſince the
Word is <hi>alwayes Vnfruitful, where rebelled againſt.</hi> But
is there no Difference <hi>J. Faldo</hi> between a Word of
Advice ſpiritually, livingly and powerfully, ſown in the
Heart, by Chriſt the great Word of God, and that
Advice, Reproof or Inſtruction declared by Writing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41053:22"/>
This brings to the Point, <hi>Whether the Scriptures or
Chriſt may moſt deſervedly be ſtiled the Word of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God's living Oracle, and rightly called the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> becauſe that which livingly ſpeaks forth
the Will of God to the Souls of Men; The <hi>Scriptures</hi>
are but that <hi>Revelation declared and recorded;</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they can have no right to that Title which
is ſo ſuitably aſcribed to the Author of that Revelation.
To be ſure <hi>J Faldo</hi> acknowledges that they are not
the Living, Powerful Self-ſufficient Word of God;
Nor does he pretend to diſpute for them to be ſuch a
Word of God as the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny them to be.
Though it ſeems very ſtrange to me, that there ſhould
be <hi>Two Words of God;</hi> the one quite differing from
the other; or that any Word of God, if two there
were, ſhould be of it ſelf Impotent or Inſufficient, as
he ſeems to allow in his <hi>firſt Book,</hi> pag 20, 27. <hi>Vind.</hi>

                  <p>That they were ſcattered, and ſeveral Centuries or

<hi>Jews</hi> of old, who thought better of the Scriptures then
of Chriſt, believing to have Life in them, at what
time they crucified the Lord of Life and Glory. From
whoſe Proceedings we learn thus much, That the worſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41053:25"/>
Enemies to the inviſible Word of Life may carry the

Titles upon the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that were given forth from
it.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, It was when Men turned from the <hi>Power</hi> of
Godlineſs to the <hi>Form</hi> only, that they did Canonize and
lay ſo vaſt a Streſs upon them. In the firſt and ſecond
hundred years after Chriſt they were ſo ſcattered, that
very few had all of them; and it is not unreaſonable for
us to believe, that many had none of them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe of the New Teſtament: Were they therefore
without <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and a ſufficient Rule for Faith
and Practice? Surely not; It was an <hi>Adminiſtration of
Life and Power of writing the Law in the Heart, and
putting the Spirit in the inward Parts.</hi> From whence
came that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Anſwer to the <hi>Heathen</hi> concerning
Swearing, Fighting, &amp; ſuch contra-Evangelical Practices,
They could not do ſo becauſe of God in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
At that time of Day <hi>the Ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nting led them into
all Truth.</hi> But in proceſs of time, when <hi>Chriſtians</hi> grew
Careleſs and Worldly, whereby they <hi>loſt the Power of
Godlineſs,</hi> then they began to ſet up an outward pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Religion, aſcribing that to the Letter and Form,
which was only due to the Spirit and Power; And as
thus entered the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> into the World, ſo where
Men are not turned and conformed to that eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and divine immortal Power, the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.
And our End in preſſing People unto the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Word of Life</hi> is, that they may be brought out
of Death and Darkneſs, which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> can never
do. They are a <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And to urge Scripture not experienced, is <hi>to ſteal
the words of Truth from our Neighbour.</hi> Inſpiration was
in requeſt after Scriptures were in the World; And
indeed are unintelligible without it. The New Birth

though thereby we are taught, that without it no

Greatneſs of the Power of the Spirit of

that <hi>the Children of God are taught by it;</hi> for, ſayes he,
<hi>If thou be a Saint, thou haſt the Spirit of God as truly
dwelling in thee as in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (now Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy)

is from its own Evidence, and that it is the Way to know

Concluſions, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus is anointed, and ſo are
they; we have the ſame Vnction with Chriſt; we have
the ſame Offices with Chriſt; we have the ſame Love of

Spirit is alwayes given, to whomſoever it is given by
the Father and the Son, as Chriſt taught his Diſciples,
promiſing them that <hi>the Father would ſend the Spirit to

made to them, and not to all the Faithful alſo? Doth

The Ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were Brethren, having

For as there is a Degree in natural, ſo in ſpiritual
Births; The Dignity of the firſt lies in Priority of Time,
the Dignity of the laſt in a more full Diſcovery of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
and eternal Life. Thus the Scriptures of the
New exceed thoſe of the Old Teſtament. Where
there is the firſt and moſt ample Declaration, there muſt
be the Preheminence. Now alas, what can we boaſt
of, that was not formerly teſtified unto; <hi>we exalt no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Spirit, neither walk we in an untroden Path;</hi> 'tis
the Everlaſting Goſpel we bear witneſs unto, and to the
Revival and Breakings forth of that ancient Life, Truth,
Spirit and Power, which according unto divers Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,
hath made People true Children of God.
What do you eſteem <hi>your own Meanings</hi> and Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Do you not intitle them to a very near relation,
the <hi>Text interpreted?</hi> We never intended to bring our
Writings upon the Vye, and diſpute with it, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for the Preheminence: But <hi>our Writings</hi> further

Truth, the Scriptures declare of, and that in the ſame

               <p>
                  <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s <hi>Catechiſm</hi> belongs to the firſt; and if he

unto Salvation, and are unto them of Service for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

Edification and Comfort: The ſame Spirit in them
receiving the Teſtimony of the Spirit, as it is declared in

makes Wiſe through Faith to Salvation, being full of
Inſtruction, Edification and Comfort; <hi>If this,</hi> I ſay,
<hi>he to deny and throw Dirt upon them,</hi> William Smith is
deeply guilty; but I leave it with God, and my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Conſcience, whether <hi>J. Faldo</hi> hath not denyed
all Honeſty in throwing ſo much Dirt undeſervedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>W. Smith:</hi> But let us ſee what <hi>Reply</hi> he makes to

               <p>To all which (as my full Anſwer) only thus much I

Light, whom we declare to be the Light of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41053:36"/>
to reveal the whole Mind of God. (Here he

                  <p>VVhatever pincht me before, I hope the
Reader will bear witneſs for him, he has been more
merciful in this <hi>Reply.</hi> He firſt brings little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of my Anſwer, and ſayes juſt nothing to what
he brought. He did not ſay <hi>obeyed</hi> or <hi>diſobeyed;</hi> The
more the Shame; As my Anſwer to the Inference will
ſufficiently manifeſt, the ſubſtance of which was this,
<q>That if the Light had been obeyed, and God's Spirit
not rebelled againſt, there had not been ſo much need
of <hi>Line upon Line,</hi> and <hi>Precept upon Precept.</hi> Therefore
was the Light or Spirit in it ſelf inſufficient? or Line
upon Line ſuperfluous? Is the Ability of a Maſter
queſtioned by the Uſe of Books? or the Uſe of
Books ſuperfluous, becauſe of his Ability? <hi>Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
belongs not to the Light, but to the Creature
that cannot receive it as it is in it ſelf.</hi> A Condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41053:37"/>
to ſuch VVayes and Means as ſuits the great
VVeakneſs and Diſtance of degenerated Man from
God, can no more conclude the Light inſufficient,
then God, Chriſt and the holy Spirit.</q> To which let
me add, that as the Law, ſo very much of Scripture, was
added, becauſe of Tranſgreſſion; that makes it not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
no more then the ſucceſleſs Strivings of the
Spirit to bring out of Tranſgreſſion (becauſe of
Man's obſtinate Rebellion) renders the Spirit not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>ſecond Inference</hi> he drew, I gave a large An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
which I ſhall contract; <q>That the Light of the
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> was one in it ſelf; That as either
writ by that Degree of Light they had, they might both
be ſaid to write by the ſame Light, and yet the VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
be no more equal then the Degrees of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation:
That the VVritings of the <hi>Jews</hi> greatly
tranſcended thoſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> from that greater
Diſcovery God vouchſafed to them. That his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Lucian</hi> and the beſt <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon an Equallity,
was wicked. That nothing lies heavier againſt the
Light within in that Blaſphemous Saying, then againſt
the Spirit in the Prophets, Apoſtles, and every good
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who by his <hi>infatuated way of Arguing</hi>
would make us believe that <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> acted
from the Light within, <hi>becauſe they acted from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within,</hi> and <hi>that there is no Diſtinction to be made

                     </q> as he ſayes. VVhat is this
but to deny all Teſtimony within, or at leaſt allows but
of ſuch a one, as gives equal Evidence to <hi>Apoſtates</hi>

and being asked, which of the multitude of Sects came
<hi>neareſt</hi> unto the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> replyed, <hi>The Quakers.</hi>
And this <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſayes, <hi>he remembers.</hi> How then he

any Argument in his Book to prove the <hi>Quakers very

He thought I made him abuſe us beyond his Intention,

Reaſon to Forgive, then Revile me.</p>
                  <p>But how comes it to paſs, that he ſayes nothing of

                  <p>Reader, obſerve the <hi>Forgery</hi> lies here, that
I left out <hi>Life,</hi> after <hi>Faith;</hi> and <hi>Determiner,</hi> after
<hi>Judge;</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> before <hi>Controverſies:</hi> But becauſe
that which is the Rule of Faith, is the Rule of Life;
and that Judge and Determiner are all one; and that
the <hi>Controverſies</hi> intended, were not about Queſtions in
<hi>Mathematicks, Philoſophy, Trade,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> common
or civil, but purely about <hi>Religion,</hi> I thought it no
Forgery to leave out words not neceſſary, or what from
the Nature of the Rule and Controverſie on foot were
manifeſtly implyed; eſpecially when I made no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41053:39"/>
to my ſelf by it. But every ſuch little thing
muſt be called by a hard Name, or <hi>John Faldo</hi> would
have little to write, and but a few to believe his
Books.</p>
                  <p>But to the Point, (avoiding many Occaſions for ſevere
Reflection) Perhaps he grants us what we can deſire.
For upon my aſſerting, that what was and is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
then the Scriptures, is moſt properly the General
Rule, he replies,</p>

                  <speaker>Rep.</speaker>
                  <p>I never affirmed them to be a general Rule, nor
is it that,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 26.</note> I charge the <hi>Quakers</hi> for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but I charge them with denying them to
be any Rule at all of Faith and Life; he miſtakes the
Queſtion, and yields my Charge to be their Principle, and
pleads for it, p. 54.</p>

                  <speaker>Rejoyn.</speaker>
                  <p>If that be not the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> how have I
granted the Queſtion? Do I plead for his Charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I plead againſt the Scriptures being the General
Rule, p. 54. which he ſayes is no part of the Charge,
and what himſelf undertakes not to contradict? But
ſure I am, <hi>if the Scriptures be not the General</hi> Rule (as
he implies (and thereby cuts his own Throat, and
grants to the <hi>Quakers</hi> the Queſtion, as largely as needs
to be) They are not <hi>The Rule</hi> by way of Excellency,
or the Rule by which God's People in all Ages have
walked; for that was and is General: So that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
upon his own Conceſſion, is but a particular Rule,
and therefore muſt be ſubſervient to <hi>the Spirit (who is
the great Evangelical Rule</hi>) as are many other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that have been made uſe of upon ſeveral Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                  <p>He might have learn'd thus much in p. 53. of my Anſwer,
where I ſay that <hi>we acknowledge the</hi> Scriptures <hi>to contain
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41053:40"/>
many Holy Rules for Godlineſs.</hi> I would know of him
how that could be, and yet deny them to be a Rule in
any ſenſe. But we have good Reaſon to deny them to
be <hi>the Rule of Faith and Judge of Controverſies, who
can neither give nor govern Faith, nor Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,</hi>
as the many different Perſwaſions in the World
fully prove; for then all that have the Scriptures would
be of one Perſwaſion, as it is moſt certain, thoſe are,
who have and walk by the One Spirit.</p>
                  <p>VVherefore ſince <hi>the Scriptures themſelves teſtifie to
the Spirit, as the great Judge, Rule and Leader,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
under the New Covenant, where the Law is not
written on Tables of Stone (much leſs Paper) but of
Fleſh, to wit, the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of
Men, the Spirit, and not the Scripture muſt be the Rule
of Faith and Judge of Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, The Scripture cannot try a preſent Motion
or Prophecy. Bad Spirits are wholely hid from it. For
Inſtance, <hi>Paul</hi> reproved not the Spirit that cryed, <hi>Theſe
are the Servants of the Moſt High God, that ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us the VVay of Eternal Life,</hi> from the Scriptures;
neither did <hi>Peter,</hi> Deceitful <hi>Ananias,</hi> but <hi>from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Inſtinct and Savour, Reliſh or Diſcerning they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Spirit of God within them</hi> 'Twas in a
Caſe of ſuch Difficulty, that ſome in theſe late Times
have writ, That the Scripture gave no general ſtanding
Rule (for all particular Caſes) <hi>in fleeing or ſtanding in
Times of Perſecution, but that it was the Frame of the
Spirits of the People of God to retire at that ſeaſon;</hi> which
whether it be true or falſe, that the Spirit of God did
ſo influence them, two things are undeniable; <hi>firſt,</hi>
That it was the <hi>Frame of their Spirits,</hi> witneſs their
Practice; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That the <hi>Scripture was not ſufficient</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41053:40"/>
for them to ſquare themſelves by on that Occaſion; And
what elſe do Profeſſors mean, when they adviſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>to ſeek the Lord</hi> in this or the other Caſe? why do
they not go ſeek the Scriptures rather? Doth not ſuch
a Practice manifeſtly detect the Scriptures of Inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and evidently prove their Acknowledgment both of
Revelation, and their Recourſe to a more Living, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
Immediate and Sufficient Rule? VVhy elſe do
they ſeek God's Mind (ſay they) by Prayers not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
but by the Spirit? But this is become deſpiſed <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi>
with <hi>J. Faldo.</hi> For Faith in his Senſe riſes no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>then ſo many Articles, laid down</hi> (ſuppoſe truly) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the bare Letter of the Scriptures,</hi> which the
Devil can believe as well as he: <hi>This Faith</hi> I call meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Verbal</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> of which the Scripture may be
a Rule, but <hi>not of Saving Faith:</hi> for of that <hi>Faith only
the Spirit can be the Rule;</hi> and why? becauſe <hi>the Spirit
of God alone reveals him to the Soul,</hi> who is the Object
of Faith, and works Faith in the Soul upon that Object;
and as this only begets Faith, ſo it increaſes, <hi>enlivens,
rules, governs</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> Faith unto Dominion. This
alone unfolds thoſe Myſteries ſpoak of in the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 30, 31.</note> Wherefore anſwered the <hi>Eunuch</hi>
unto <hi>Philip,</hi> when he queried, Underſtandeſt

I had a guide,</hi> as ſayes our <hi>old</hi> Engliſh Tranſlation,
which implies, That the things declared of by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not to be underſtood from the Scriptures, but
a more Living, Spiritual and Certain Guide, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we affirm, That <hi>Repentance, Faith, Sanctification,
Juſtification, Redemption, Regeneration, &amp;c. are all a
Myſtery never to be diſcloſed, but by the Revelation and
Operation of the Spirit of God in Man;</hi> the Scripture can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41053:41"/>
only teſtfie to ſuch things, that they are; but it is <hi>the
Spirit alone that works them, and illuminates, guides,
governs and rules the Soul in and about ſuch things.</hi> 'Tis
true, all the Spirit leads to is according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
it overturns them not; for they declare of moſt
of theſe Operations; yet becauſe we believe, know
and witneſs them from the Conviction and Operation
of the Spirit, before we can poſſibly underſtand them
in Scripture; therefore the Scripture is but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
and not the Rule of Faith, &amp;c. And the only
beſt way to determine any Controverſie on foot about
<hi>Repentance, Faith, Sanctification, Juſtification, &amp;c.</hi> is
the Judgment of that Spirit which works them; For
how can the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that has ſo many Meanings put
upon it, <hi>determine which of thoſe meanings is the true?</hi>
Let them ſhew me that Scripture that plainly and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatedly
tells me, ſuch a Propoſition is True, and ſuch
a one is Falſe, that conſiſts only of their additional
Meanings; ſuch a new Nick-named People right, and
ſuch wrong, and they do their Buſineſs; if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
as it is impoſſible they ſhould, they muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to ſomething elſe to rule &amp; determine; and what
can that be beſides that <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> which worked
the true Faith, and ruled the holy Life of thoſe Ancients,
who gave forth this Declaration of Faith and Life?</p>
                  <p>Can any Man t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll another's Mind better then himſelf?
or reſolve any Doubt, or clear up any Miſ-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning what is delivered, better then he that
ſpoak it? <hi>To underſtand thoſe holy Men's Mind, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them that miſtake it, there is an unavoidable neceſſity
of coming to that Spirit which made it theirs.</hi> 'Tis gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that all True Doctrine is according to Scripture;
but the Queſtion is, <hi>What is true Doctrine?</hi> Scripture
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41053:41"/>
is a ſtrong Teſtimony; but what enlightens the Mind,
reſolves Doubts, and works Faith, and informs, guides
and helps the Soul through the whole Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
and without which the Teſtimony of Scripture
it ſelf is truly an unintelligible and an incredible thing?
This muſt be nothing leſs then <hi>the Spirit it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, <hi>The Scripture</hi> is not the Rule, but <hi>Declaration
of Faith and Knowledge;</hi> That only muſt be the Rule of
Faith, which gave and ruled the Faith of thoſe that gave
forth Scripture. And becauſe none can give or work
Faith now, but what did give and work Faith then; 'tis
not the Scripture, but that which was before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
even <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> which was the Author,
Rule and Finiſher of their Faith. And if our Faith in
this Age be the ſame with the holy Men's of old that
gave forth the Scriptures; they are no more our Rule
now then they were theirs then, who had a Rule and a
Faith before them: But as it was a Declaration of what
they believed, knew and witneſſed; ſo it is a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what we now believe and deſire to know and
witneſs. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle was not writ to be the Saints
Rule; for he directed them to the Anointing; yet
their Faith and Life of which the Anointing was the
Rule, was according to <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle. Agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, The
Declaration in time was after the Faith declared of;
but where there was Faith, there was a Rule, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that Declaration which was after that Faith
and Rule, <hi>was not that Rule;</hi> ſo that the moſt that can
be ſaid againſt us is this, The Scriptures cannot be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of your Faith, till you come to ſuch a Belief
of the Truth's thereby expreſſed, as they had who writ
them; and a great Truth it is. But then ſay we, <hi>The
Spirit muſt work that Faith, before the Scriptures can be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41053:42"/>
accounted a Declaration of our Faith, or we intereſted
in them,</hi> And becauſe that <hi>Faith has a Rule ſo ſoon as it
has a being,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that the Declaration of
that Faith cannot be either the Author or Rule of it. Here
lies the Miſtake of my Adverſary and many more, that
becauſe what a Man does is according or agreeable to a
thing, therefore that is the Rule of the thing done. To
proceed.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon it is, a Conſtraint lies upon us from God,
to direct and exhort all People diligently <hi>to mind that

the Head of this Generation, who make War againſt

would not any from hence ſhould repute me ſo Impious,

ſo ſtrongly oppugn'd the Doctrine of Revelation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
I muſt take leave to conclude in his Name and
upon his Principles, that <hi>the VVord of God is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
and <hi>a great part of the Rule of Faith and Life, and
Judge of Controverſie is loſt,</hi> and that he has no more

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41053:44"/>
Ground has he for his Faith beſides Tradition? and what
Evidence can he give us upon his Principles of the Truth
of the former and Falſhood of the latter? Theſe <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
and <hi>Synods</hi> who collected and canonized them he
accepts for one part, and rejects for the other. Again,
he truſts their Judgment in picking and chuſing, and yet
rejects their Interpretation; as if it were not ſo difficult
to reliſh Genuine from Spurious Scriptures, as (when
rightly diſcerning them to be ſuch) to underſtand them;
which is an abſolute Contradiction; For <hi>how ſhould they
know true from Falſe, and not underſtand the True?</hi> That
<hi>Council</hi> which made the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament
Canonical,</hi> left out the <hi>Revelations</hi> as <hi>Apocriphal;</hi> yet I
hope <hi>J. Faldo</hi> accepts that as heartily
and unqueſtionably as the reſt:<note place="margin">Concil Tom. 1. p. 481. can. 60. Anno 364. and p. 549. can. 27. Anno 417. after Chriſt.</note> And that

to be Canonical (if it be proper to ſay, the firſt is the
Rule of his Canon, which is too ſhort; and the other
which is ſuperfluous, as by his Account) My next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is, <hi>What was his Rule for believing thoſe Councils?</hi>
I am ſure he muſt have been without all other, then a
<hi>Willingneſs to believe ſo, becauſe they ſaid ſo;</hi> which how
like this is to his <hi>Papiſt,</hi> unto whom he would reſemble

he is able to oppugn any thing they ſay upon Tradition,

of it ſelf, <hi>the Spirit muſt be the Rule of our Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the Scripture,</hi> as it was before the Rule of
our Faith concerning the Divine Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
For the <hi>Light of the Interpreter,</hi> and not the
Thing interpreted <hi>is the Rule both of Faith and Practice;</hi>
which is undeniably evident from the reconciling of
ſeeming Contradictions: If the meer Letter of the
Scripture were to be followed, no Man could ever make
them meet in the ſame Truth; The many <hi>Different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions

to pag. 46.</p>
                  <p>To prove his <hi>former Charge,</hi> he produces this Paſſage
out of <hi>James Naylor,</hi> 
                     <q>God is at Liberty to
ſpeak <hi>to his People by the Scriptures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">pag. 27.</note> if he
pleaſe, and ſo he is at Liberty to ſpeak by another
created thing, as <hi>to Balaam by his Aſs;</hi>
                     </q> and becauſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41053:46"/>
I returned in Anſwer, <q>To all which (ſaid I) he ſayes
juſt nothing;</q> he replies, <hi>As if</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I were to
anſwer the Proofs of my own Affirmation.</hi> But that was
not all; for beſide that, <hi>it was no Proof:</hi> He ſhould have
proved it <hi>Erroneous</hi> or <hi>Contemptible,</hi> as he ſtiles it, or
elſe he doth nothing; To cite, and not prove the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
apt to the End for which it was cited, that is, the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> it contained or abetted to be <hi>Erroneous</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.
What? Is it falſe Doctrine to aſſert, <hi>That
God is at Liberty to ſpeak by the Scriptures or without
them?</hi> Or is it to contemn the Scriptures to ſay as <hi>John
Faldo</hi> cites <hi>J. N.</hi> that God doth ſpeak to People by
thoſe Scriptures that were given forth by Inſpiration? Or,
is it no Proof, that God is at Liberty to ſpeak by any other
created thing to inſtance the Caſe of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>Aſs?</hi> But
he will by all means have it, that according to <hi>J. N.</hi> to
take an <hi>Aſs or Bible to be our Inſtructer, is of equal Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
adding, <hi>Theſe Notions,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>being by the</hi>
Quakers <hi>ſucked in; I wonder not that they leave the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
of God by the Scriptures to attend on the Miniſtry
of Aſſes.</hi> But this indirect Reflection and unſavory A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,
both ſhews the Vanity and Envy of the Man, and
muſt needs beget an Abhorrence of his Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us in the Heart of every ſolid Reader. It had
much better become the Author of <hi>Poor Robin's Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack,</hi>
or the <hi>Cobler of Gloceſter,</hi> then a Turn'd-out
Non-conforming Miniſter. <hi>J. N</hi>'s words I fully vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in my Anſwer; his Drift was, to drive off Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from this pernicious Apprehenſion, that God's Voice
was only to be heard from the Scripture, thereby juſtling
the Spirit out of Doors, and confining the Almighty to
a certain Inſtrument; and <hi>not that he intended to repute
every Aſs of equal value with the Scriptures;</hi> though I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41053:46"/>
do not doubt but the Voice of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs was a more
immediate and forcible Rebuke with him, then any
Scripture then written.</p>
                  <p>But let this character our <hi>Adverſary</hi> with every Juſt
knowing Reader, that he brings <hi>J. N</hi>'s words that
allow ſuch Scripture as God ſhall pleaſe to ſpeak to any
by, <hi>to be ſo far a Rule,</hi> to thoſe to whom its directed,
in order to prove, <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny the Scripture
to be in any caſe any Rule at all:</hi> But we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
better Uſage from a Man, who is more perplext
at our proving of our ſelves conſiſtent with Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it contradicts his Apprehenſions and Charges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
againſt us in Print, then that we ſhould be in the
Wrong, though for that Cauſe he pretends to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us. Strange! that he ſhould rather deſire we
might be miſtaken, then himſelf be thought to have
miſtaken us.</p>
                  <p>But he thinks I have greatly wrong'd St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
I know not why,<note place="margin">pag. 28, 29.</note> unleſs it were in ſhowing
him to have been guilty of that Fault; for
to prove <hi>the Scriptures to be the Rule,</hi> he brought this
Saying of his; <hi>And herein, that is,</hi> ſaith our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
[<hi>all things that are written in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets]
do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have a Conſcience void of
Offence towards God and towards Men.</hi> My Anſwer
then was,<note place="margin">pag. 58, 59.</note> that he left out that which was
more applicable to the words, as the place
it ſelf evidently proves; [<hi>But this I confeſs to thee,</hi>
(that is, Faelix) <hi>that after the way which they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all
things that are written in the Law and the Prophets, and
have Hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41053:47"/>
that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead, both
of the Juſt and the Vnjuſt; and herein,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>do I exerciſe my ſelf, &amp;c.</hi>] Where its evident,
that believing all things that are written in the Law
and the Prophets, was not that wherein he ſaid
(ſo properly) that he exerciſed himſelf, as <hi>in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the God of his Fathers; not after their way, and
having Hope towards God of the Reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi> there
lay the Streſs, as is evident from their calling that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<hi>Hereſie,</hi> and afflicting him for that <hi>Hope</hi> which
they otherwiſe allowed of. Nay, that very Paſſage he
makes the whole place to bear upon, comes in rather
in the Nature of a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> then a Principal Matter;
His thus dealing with us and the Scripture I call'd a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
at which he very vainly taunts, as if <hi>it could
not be a Perverſion, becauſe I confeſs that it ſomewhat
relates to the Verſes cited,</hi> crying out, <hi>This is his Mouſe
his Mountain travelled to bring forth:</hi> But if to <hi>clip a
Text</hi> be not a Perverſion, or to <hi>ſtretch it</hi> to what it
can never reach, nor ever intended, be not to <hi>pervert
and abuſe Scripture,</hi> certainly there is no ſuch thing.
That he clipped it, is proved; that he miſapplyed it,
is not leſs evident: For to believe a thing, is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
to make it a Rule; beſides, if the Law and the
Prophets were a Rule, becauſe he was exerciſed in them,
<hi>then muſt his Worſhip and Hope alſo be a Rule, becauſe he
was exerciſed in them;</hi> but that were improper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.
<hi>He is angry</hi> I ſaid, the Apoſtle had out-ſtript
the Law and the Prophets, therefore they could not
be his Rule, replying, <hi>If</hi> St. Paul <hi>had undertaken a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to this Gentleman, he would have undoubtedly laſht
him ſeverely for this Wrong done to him and the Truth.</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41053:47"/>
But I am not of that Mind; for if he did not out-ſtrip
the Diſpenſation of the Law and Prophets, <hi>how could he
arrive at that State which witneſſed the Fulfilling of
the Law and the Prophets;</hi> To deny this, is to deny the
further Illumination and Enjoyment of that Day; and
according to <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s own unhappy way of Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>the Apoſtle muſt not be a Chriſtian;</hi> for in denying
the <hi>Prophets</hi> to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they were before
Chriſt's viſible Appearance, and preferring <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>
ſo much above other fore-going Diſpenſations, as he
doth, in not allowing the Apoſtle to have out-ſtript
them, <hi>he makes the Apoſtle to be no</hi> Chriſtian; <hi>For which,</hi>
I will not ſay, <hi>he would have Laſht, but Reproved this
ignorant</hi> Prieſt, <hi>as one that knows not whereof he affirms.</hi>
But hear him yet further.</p>

for every Caſe that ever did or may happen (which

yet if ſuch Scripture need an Expoſition, who is moſt

a Judge? If then they are <hi>Dark, Obſcure</hi> and <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

                        </gap>e Rule, and the Judge, from thy Judgment of that little (if any) Difference that is between them. And my Adverſary to his own Confuſion ſeemeth of the ſame Mind; for notwithſtanding he ſeverely &amp; tauntingly reflects on that Paſſage upon me in my former Book, yet in making the Scripture both Rule and Judge, he ſhows to us, that the Judge &amp; the Rule are not at ſo great a Diſtance, as his little Skill in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> would have rendered it. And herein he thwarts D.<hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and D.<hi>Tilloſſon,</hi> who againſt the <hi>Papists</hi> aſſert not the Scripture to be the Judge, but Right Reaſon; And to ſpeak the Truth of it, Nothing can be more abſurd next to Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, then that the Scripture ſhould be the Judge of a Man's Meaning of any part of it ſelf, that is, if it be applied as a Right Rule; ſince in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Difference no Scripture ever yet ſpoak clearer then its firſt Text; and the Queſtion lies not about that, but the juſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</note> But I would have
him conſider two things;
<hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Scriptures
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41053:49"/>
of Truth were never given
forth after that formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
courſe that the Laws
of <hi>England</hi> were; but to
particular Perſons or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
on particular Caſes,
though together with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reſpect I acknowledge
and enjoy the Benefit of
them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is not about things
obvious, but obſcure; and
herein the Judge is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Mouth, but Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the hidden Meaning
of the Law; This our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi>'s
own words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
For if the <hi>Law</hi> were
ſo plain, as only to <hi>need a
Mouth,</hi> what need would
there be of <hi>deep Study</hi> and
<hi>Weighty Conſideration,</hi>
which he makes neceſſary
to a Judge? the bare read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law would be
ſufficient to determine all Caſes; Nay, it would end all
going to Law: But inaſmuch as the Laws are both nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and intricate, as the Vexatious Caſes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of our Times fully prove, 'tis manifeſt, that ſome
<hi>other Judge and Determiner</hi> muſt be found out, one that
underſtands, compares and rightly applies Law, whoſe
Judgment muſt decide and determine the Controverſie.
Now though every ſuch Judge may be ſaid to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41053:50"/>
according to the Mind of the Law, yet his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
and not the bare Letter is recorded for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Caſe</hi> depending, from whence come
our <hi>Book-Caſes;</hi> Nor indeed is this only referrable to
any <hi>certain Perſon,</hi> explaining the obſcure Paſſages of
Law, but the <hi>Application of the Law to the Fact,</hi> in
which not only the whole living Reaſon of the Judge is
deeply and circumſpectly exerciſed, but the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and Conſcience of the Jury, reſpecting the Nature
of the Law, the Evidence of the Witneſs, the Heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Fact, and Variety of Circumſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

to that noble Principle from whence all good
Laws come have a higher Judge and Rule, then any of
thoſe written Laws, or any Interpretations of men upon
them; ſo that if <hi>J. Faldo</hi> compares the Scripture to the
written Laws, they who are led by the Spirit have an
higher Rule then the Scripture: and as he that lives
up according to written Laws, by the Rule of his <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſis,</hi>
or Law of Laws, the juſt Principle in himſelf,
does not deſtroy but fulfil thoſe written Laws: ſo <hi>they

but fulfil the Scriptures.</hi> There is no need of
<hi>Swearing</hi> for a Remedy againſt that Man's Falſeneſs,

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41053:50"/>
he that is come up to the greater, does not ſleight
but anſwer the leſſer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I beſeech the Reader to
obſerve, that theſe written Laws had once a beginning,
and that thoſe that made them were not without a Rule
and Judge in themſelves, both before, and in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of thoſe Laws (neither is that peculiar to them,
the Law-makers) I ſtill mean <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> of which many
Lawyers ſpeak great things, particularly a good old
Law-Book, called, <hi>Doctor and Student,</hi>
which is not leſſened by thoſe Laws,<note place="margin">Doct. Stud. c. 2. p. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>nor
ought any Law to be made, or take hold on

<hi>Immutable Law,</hi> by <hi>Chief Juſtice Hobart,</hi> in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
pag. 87. So that both the Law was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> and is to be underſtood and
judged according to this <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> which <hi>Syntereſis</hi> or
<hi>Law of Righteouſneſs,</hi> has not left us with a meer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of its Mind, ſubject to many Caſuallities and
Difficulties, but remains in the Heart of Man to inform
his Underſtanding and correct his Life; conſequently
the <hi>Judge of Controverſie,</hi> reſpecting the <hi>written
Law</hi> (about which, and the Application of it, many
times ariſes the Controverſie) muſt not be the <hi>written,</hi>
but this <hi>Immutable Law in Judge and Jury,</hi> from
whence all good Laws proceed. It is a very depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

<hi>Beza</hi>'s words be cited, and <hi>Calvin</hi> not deny'd ſo to

                     <hi>J. Calvin</hi> expreſly tells us, <hi>Idem spriritus qui per os

to miſtake me, that he may render me miſtaken. I
cited him to one part of the Chapter and Verſe, and he
to another; For my Purpoſe was, to prove, that <hi>Beza</hi>
held it to be the <hi>Right Way of underſtanding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

it ſelf thus, <hi>Imó quid ſi <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>He</hi> was to ariſe in the Heart, if <hi>He</hi> was the Day-Star in

                  <p>He has a notable Way of Contracting his
Adverſary's Anſwers; I will ſet down what I writ, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
plainly and briefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi>'s Expreſſion may be taken two
ways,<note place="margin">pa. 71, 72, 73.</note> &amp; both ſafe enough to the Honour
and Credit of the Scripture, though not to
the Charity or Honeſty of <hi>J. Faldo.</hi>
                     </q> Now follows that
part he cited. <q>No Command in the Scripture is any
further oblieging upon any Man, then as he finds a
Conviction upon his Conſcience, otherwiſe men ſhould
be engag'd without, if not againſt Conviction, a thing
Unreaſonable in a Man; Therefore the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when
he wrote to the Churches, exhorted them, not to do
thoſe things whereof they were aſhamed, to ſhun what
was manifeſted to be Evil; and affirms, <hi>that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
might be known of God was manifeſted within, for
God had ſhown it unto them.</hi> So that Conviction can
only obliege to Obedience: and ſince what works that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41053:57"/>
Conviction is the <hi>manifeſting Light, univerſal Grace,
or quickening Spirit in the Heart of Mankind,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that <hi>the principal Ground for our Faith in the
Scriptures, and Reaſon of our Obedience to the Holy
Precepts therein contained, is the Manifeſtation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
and ſecret Drawings of the Light or Spirit of
God in the Conſcience.</hi> And thus <hi>E. B</hi>'s words
are ſound and ſcriptural. Again, Such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
either relate to <hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary
Caſes.</hi> By <hi>Ordinary Caſes</hi> I mean, ſuch as chiefly
concern <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>holy Life,</hi> which are general, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
and indiſpenſible; and then I deny his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
By <hi>Extraordinary Caſes</hi> I underſtand <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s
<hi>going to</hi> Pharoah, <hi>the Prophets ſeveral manners of
Appearance to the Kings, Prieſts and People of</hi> Iſrael,
<hi>with other Temporary Commands relating to outward
Services, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo we ſay, that what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>One</hi> Man, <hi>is not binding, as ſuch, upon another:</hi>
But when the Lord ſhall ſay, <hi>If thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt
dye; If thou keepeſt my Commands thou ſhalt live; Be
ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy;—For your
ſelves KNOW YE NOT how ye ought to follow us,
&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, theſe Precepts and Examples are oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
upon all; why? becauſe they more or leſs meet
with a Conviction in the Conſciences of all: For
I am perſwaded, none that has a reaſonable Soul, who
has not out-liv'd his Day, but would readily ſay,
Theſe are true and weighty Sayings; For <hi>Faith in God,
and a holy ſelf-denying Life, are neceſſary both to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

                     <hi>They are no Commands unleſs we think ſo. 'Tis
no Sin to break all the Commands in the Bible, if our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
can be ſo blind, dead or hardened as not to tell us,
'tis a Sin. They who thought they did God good Service in
killing his Servants did not ſin in the leaſt, becauſe they
were not convinced of a Command to the contrary. To
vindicate my whole Chapter concerning the Scriptures.
'Tis a Principle that hath all Iniquity in the Womb
of it. Who can find Names for ſuch Impious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?</hi>
Penn <hi>hath oppoſed, ſcorned the Truth, vilified its

                     <hi>Reader,</hi> This is all the Juſtice and Reaſon I
can have from this pretended <hi>meek and ſuffering Non-conforming
Parſon.</hi> What would ſuch Men do, had they
as much Power as Anger? But I ſhall leave him with his
Pride and Paſſion. Is there any thing more clear then
that he extends the words of <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> to <hi>Ordinary
Caſes,</hi> which were wholely writ about <hi>Extraordinary;</hi>
and that he takes no more notice of my <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> then
if there had been none made? As if it had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
an equal Sin for any <hi>not to be Circumciſed,</hi> and <hi>to
Murder his Father or Prince;</hi> or that there was the ſame
Conviction univerſally upon the Conſciences
of all Men,<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>not to wear Linſey-Wolſey, as to
do by others as they would have others do to
them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That what we ſay was <hi>E. Burroughs</hi>'s Meaning, his
own words undeniably prove. <q>One, ſayes he, was ſent to
baptize, and another to preach the Goſpel:</q> which were
particular and extraordinary Commands. He clearly
ſhuffles &amp; evades the dint of my Anſwer, &amp; would run us
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41053:58"/>
within the Borders of <hi>Rantiſm.</hi> The Queſtion is not,
<hi>Are God's Commands no Commands, unleſs we think ſo,
and therefore no Sin to break all the Commands in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
(which is the Comment he beſtows upon us) but
whether this or that eſpecial Injunction to any Particular
Perſon or Perſons, to this or that parculiar End, be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
imitable, without ſufficient Conviction and
Commiſſion: Muſt <hi>J. F.</hi> Baptize becauſe <hi>John</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?
or turn Preacher becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was one. <hi>E. B.</hi>
only denyed Imitation of Ancient Times in Temporary
and Shadowy Services, and all thoſe Preachings, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Ordinances and Churches, that have not (as <hi>Peter
Martyr</hi> well expreſſes it) <hi>the holy Spirit for their Root.</hi>
So that inſtead of his holding a Principle that hath all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in the Womb of it, <hi>John Faldo</hi> firſt perverts his
words, and then to confute them both implies a Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of the holy Spirit to be the only right Leader to the
Performance of Goſpel-Prayer, Preaching and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and of gathering of Evangelical Churches, and does as
good as tell us, that God's Commandments are ſuch to
him, not becauſe of any Conviction in himſelf of the
Juſtneſs of them, but from the Teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which for all his high <hi>Boaſts</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is a
State far beneath thoſe <hi>noble Gentiles,</hi> who <hi>not having an
outward Law, were a Law unto themſelves, having the
Effect of it written in their Hearts, their Conſcience, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witneſs, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this we may boldly ſay, That <hi>ſuch as ever acted
from that inward Senſe, never thought they did God Good
Service in Killing his Servants,</hi> whilſt great Admirers of
the Letter of the Scriptures, and who, as concerning
this Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Murder,</hi> thought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41053:59"/>
themſelves moſt unblamable, believed, <hi>They did God
Good Service in killing his Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor can I think it ſo great a <hi>Diſgrace</hi> to our Cauſe,
that we ingenuouſly profeſs the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why we deſire
to fear God, and keep his Commandments, doing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, as we would have them do unto us, <hi>not ſo
much to be from the Letter of the Scripture as the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Eternal Light and Spirit of God in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;</hi>
As it ought to be unto <hi>John Faldo</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
who ground their Obedience upon the Letter
of the Scripture, and not upon ſuch internal Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
What is it but to ſay, They could <hi>Lye, Swear,
Steal, Kill, &amp;c. without any Remorſe,</hi> did they not
find ſuch Injunctions and Prohibitions upon record? A
Conſequence ſo deteſtable, yet ſo natural to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that if this render them not able Guides to the
very Confines of <hi>Rantiſm</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> I ſhall gladly
ask an Excuſe for my Ignorance, But that I may leave
nothing undone that may compleat the Satisfaction of
every moderate Inquirer, I ſhall further weigh and rejoyn
to theſe words of his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They who thought they did God good Service in Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Servants, did not ſin in the leaſt, becauſe they
were not convinced of a Command to the contrary; nor the
Idolaters in the Caſe of</hi> Baal, <hi>becauſe they thought</hi> Baal
<hi>to be a God indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Reader,</hi> obſerve the Evaſion: This Paſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
not to Men's practiſing <hi>what God Commands,</hi> or
our Tenderneſs in imitating other Saints without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
for fear we ſhould offer ſtrange Fire, which is
our Queſtion; but their doing that which <hi>God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi>
yea, <hi>which Mankind in all Ages hath adjudged
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41053:59"/>
impious,</hi> and which to be ſure, his Holy Spirit, that
<hi>E. B.</hi> ſaid, All Men ſhould wait to be convinced, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and led by in fulfilling God's Commandments, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
moved any to. He unworthily draws a general
Concluſion againſt us from meer particular Premiſes.
It ſeems Men are to act without, if not againſt Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
upon his Principle; and that it is the ſame thing
with him, to commit moral Enormities from an Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Heart, and to be tender of taking up any external
Practice, or performing ſome Religious Duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Convictions and Leadings of the Holy Spirit.
The Apoſtle ſaid to ſuch as had not as yet ſo full clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as others,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> That <hi>if any were otherwiſe-minded,
God would reveal it.</hi> He did not
injoyn them during that Scruple to believe or practice
the thing doubted; but therefore did Perſecutors act
inexcuſably in their fiery Zeal, becauſe their blind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
checkt them not. Again, If <hi>Blindneſs</hi> came
from Education, it is (though Blindneſs ſtill (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was baſely done of <hi>J. Faldo</hi> to ſay in our Name,
that it is not Sin in the leaſt, &amp;c.) more excuſable: for
in the dayes of ſuch Ignorance God winks: But if it be a
Blindneſs proceeding from long Diſobedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
againſt the Convictions and Strivings of the
Good Spirit of God, as his Word <hi>Hardned</hi> implies, then,
I ſay, it is not only very hainous in God's Sight; but
thoſe Perſons can never be excuſed neither from great
Guilt, nor the Senſe of it in themſelves, let them or
<hi>J. F.</hi> talk never ſo much of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the moſt Eſſential, and Univerſally Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Commands of God were through all Ages confeſt
to; both before there was any of thoſe Writings, we
rightly call the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> from the <hi>Law of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41053:60"/>
Nature,</hi> as many ſtile it, or rather, the <hi>Law God placed
in Man's Nature,</hi> and ſince, where they have never
been; Therefore, whatever <hi>particular hardned and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conſciences</hi> may ſay, we have the Conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and their own Rebellion and Lewdneſs againſt
them. But the Words of <hi>J. Faldo</hi> in plain terms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
as if, <hi>1 ſt,</hi> Men were not generally convinced of
the Righteouſneſs of the Moral Commands of God;
but that Men keep them becauſe they are in the Bible
only; which runs againſt the Teſtimony of Scripture,
the Conſent of Ages, and the Writings and Judgment
of the moſt Honeſt and Learn'd <hi>Proteſtants. 2ly,</hi> As
if it were a like Evil, Conſcientiouſly to forbear Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Willing and Striving in Matters of Worſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit's Conduct, and <hi>ſearedly to plead for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Murder and Idolatry,</hi> becauſe Men of ſuch
Conſciences bogle not at it (though that is more then
<hi>J. F.</hi> can prove, I mean, that they have no Stroak or
Remorſe) 3<hi>ly,</hi> As if we could worſhip, preach, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches, and adminiſter Goſpel-Ordinances aright
without the Spirit. 4<hi>ly,</hi> That he is not convinced by any
other Teſtimony then the Scripture without, of any
Tranſgreſſion againſt God's Law. 5<hi>ly,</hi> It ſuppoſes that
if Men ſtay'd till the Spirit mov'd, they ſhould ſtay long
enough (who vainly prate of Praying by the Spirit
notwithſtanding) never conſidering that the Spirit ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ready to <hi>Reveal</hi> it ſelf to their Aſſiſtance and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
who wait for it; and that all the <hi>Children of
God are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> which being our Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had it but been weighed by this Adverſary, he
could not (methinks) be ſo Unjuſt in his Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, ſhould we believe as he doth, <hi>the Spirit is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41053:60"/>
not to be waited for now adayes to lead us,</hi> or that <hi>it is not
ready to our Information, when we wait for its Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Leadings,</hi> our Aſſertion would look very abſurd
and looſe; for it were to let fall all Worſhip, but not
upon our own Principle, as I ſaid before; for <hi>firſt,</hi> all
Worſhip to God ought to be performed by the Aſſiſtance
of his holy Spirit; for of our ſelves we can do nothing
that is Good: And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> God's Spirit is ready to
aſſiſt, inſtruct and comfort thoſe that wait diligently and
patiently for it; yea, God has given it to the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that it may judge them, if it don't lead them.
It is ſuch <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine, that I wonder Men ſhould
not know their Admired Anceſtors Faith when they
met it: Oh great Degeneration into Hardneſs and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance!
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is the ſame to be ſaid againſt
him that pretends to ground all upon the Scripture, that
he objects againſt us, who plead for the Conviction of
Conſcience, which the Inſtance of the <hi>Jews Murder of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> unanſwerably proves. There was
a Law, that <hi>Blaſphemers, ſhould be put to Death;</hi> By this
Law they apprehended Jeſus, adjudged, and got him to
be executed: Theſe Men above any Age exalted the
Scriptures as the Only Rule. <hi>Where lies the Miſtake?</hi>
Not in the Scripture, but <hi>in their blind and envious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it.</hi> Now I ask, if the only Way for them
to have come to the true Senſe and Knowledge of him,
and eſcaped that Wicked Murder, and the Deplorable
Conſequences of it, had not been <hi>to have waited upon
God for the Convictions, Diſcoveries and Guidance of

that we exclude the Scriptures, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our own Books and Miniſtry with them, from being

Wretched a Meaning</hi> to words ſo far from bearing it,

I may add for further Explanation, thus, That <hi>thoſe

Grieving the Holy Spirit, are not withſtanding Enemies
to the Children of God, who are led by the Spirit,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the true Meaning of Scripture, which the

that the Danger lies here, <hi>to be led by the Letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the true Meaning of the Letter,</hi> or rather by his own
<hi>dark Apprehenſions</hi> concerning the Mind of it, in the

Senſe of our Friend's words; For had they been writ in

then as greatly deteſted them, as he has now wrong'd
them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Paſſage is, in his firſt Book, pag. 109. his
words theſe, Iſaac Penington, <hi>who speaking of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
gain'd by the Letter of the Scriptures, writes thus,</hi>
                     <q>Making him wiſe and able in his Head, to oppoſe
Truth, and ſo bringing him into a State of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Wrath and Miſery beyond the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and
making him harder to be wrought upon, by the Light
and Power of Truth then the very <hi>Heathen.</hi>
                     </q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> beſtows this Comment; <hi>If read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, and getting Knowledge from them, puts
us into a bad Condition beyond the</hi> Heathen, <hi>I ſcarce know
what is more dangerous then reading the Scriptures.</hi>

Reader, 'tis worth our while to ſee, if <hi>I. Penington</hi>
be as bad a Man as <hi>J. Faldo</hi> repreſents him; in order
to which I ask, <hi>Firſt, May a Man, that reads and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to value the Scriptures, from up an Vnderſtanding
of them, and yet be abſolutely miſtaken, for want of the
True Interpreter, the Spirit of Truth?</hi> I cannot think
but <hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf will ſay, that ſuch a thing may
be; I am ſure I believe ſo: for it hath often been ſo
already, and <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s preſent Writings are an Unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
Inſtance for the Point. The <hi>next Queſtion</hi> I
would ask is this; <hi>Whether ſuch Perſons ſo miſtaken,
are not very apt in Defence of their own Conceivings, to
oppoſe the Truth it ſelf?</hi> Methinks the whole <hi>Jewiſh
Church,</hi> at the time of Chriſt's Viſible Appearance in
the World, in diſputing againſt him, and decrying of
his Religion, while they magnify'd the Scriptures, as
the only great Doctors of them, ſhould without further
Labour anſwer that Queſtion in the Affirmative. <hi>Next,</hi>
Let me ask <hi>J. Faldo, If the high Conceit the</hi> Jews <hi>had
of their Knowledge in the Commands, Doctrines and
Prophecies of Scripture (however Erroneous for want of
the True Interpreter) did not render them more captious
and obdurate then the</hi> Heathen <hi>themſelves?</hi> If he can
read the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, he may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
this Queſtion to our Mind, and his own Shame.
<hi>Laſtly; Was not this State more dangerous, then that of
the</hi> Gentiles? God himſelf long ſince reſolv'd this
Queſtion, when he brought ſuch heavy Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and turn'd the Stream of his Love to the
<hi>Gentiles.</hi> It was not for nought thoſe words were left
upon record; <hi>He came to his own, and his own received
him not:</hi> That is, He came to the Nation and People
of all others God had <hi>ſelected</hi> for his Service, to whom
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41053:68"/>
he had been propitious beyond meaſure, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
by <hi>wonderful Miracles,</hi> and bleſſed with <hi>Holy
Leaders, Juſt Judges, <hi>a</hi> Righteous Law, True</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prophets;</hi> whoſe were the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures,
who were the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and of whom Chriſt came
as concerning the Fleſh;</hi> yet they received him not as
God over all, bleſſed forever, manifeſted in Fleſh, in
the Fulneſs of Time, for their Deliverance; but vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
rejected him, under the Title of <hi>Beelzebub,
Prince of Devils.</hi> By this time, I hope, <hi>Iſaac Pening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Paſſage is vindicated from the Malignity of our
Adverſary's Comment, whoſe Perverſion muſt needs be
open and conſpicuous to all that read him; <hi>Firſt, in</hi>
charging him, <hi>To have made this Reflection upon the
Knowledge gained by the Letter of the Scriptures;</hi> which
are none of <hi>I. P</hi>'s words: <hi>Next,</hi> in concluding, that by
<hi>I. P</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>nothing can well be more Dangerous then
Reading the Scriptures</hi> (who alwayes was, and yet is,
a great Reſpecter and Reader of them) making the
Streſs of <hi>I. P</hi>'s Saying to lie in a Diſlike and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Scriptures abſolutely, inſtead of their
dark Interpretations upon, and Carnal Deductions from
the Scriptures, which he only levell'd his Diſcourſe
againſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we been ſerv'd in every pretended Proof
he has brought out of our Friends Writings, to prop and
enforce his feeble and incredible Charges; For where
we reprove <hi>Men's forming unto themſelves Religion
from the Letter of the Scriptures, according to their own
Conceptions of it,</hi> and give a Check to their great Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs

Cavilling and Contending concerning them, whilſt

Two notable Teſtimonies given by Univerſity-Men,
and ſuch as were reputed Famous Thirty Years
ago.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is out of <hi>Joſhua Sprigg</hi>'s Book, entituled,
<hi>A Teſtimony to an Approaching Glory,</hi> pag. 96. <q>Chriſt
deſires that his Diſciples may be ſanctified, not by
planting the Knowledge of the LITERAL <hi>Word in
their Minds,</hi> but by ingrafting the Nature of the
DIVINE <hi>Word in their Hearts.</hi> Again, in pag. 107.
Chriſt may offer himſelf long enough in the LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
in the HISTORY of the Goſpel, but if he
appear not in the SPIRIT, and ſit in our Conſciences
to quiet them, we ſhall never have any true Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the Word aright. And in page 79, &amp; 80.
We may ſee what is to be done by looking upon the
HISTORY of Chriſt; <hi>but till we find the ſame things
done in us in ſome meaſure in the</hi> MYSTERY, <hi>we can
find little Comfort</hi>—The whole HISTORY of
Chriſt will profit you nothing, nor all that you know,
<hi>except you find</hi> EXPERIMENTALLY <hi>the ſame things
done in you by the Spirit.</hi>

<hi>Bachellor of Divinity and Fellow of King's Colledge
in Cambridge,</hi> in his Book, entituled, <hi>Refreſhing Drops,

It is neither <hi>Moſes, nor the Scriptures, nor Chriſt's
Works,</hi> can ſettle our Hearts, unleſs the Father be
in them, &amp;c.</q> Alſo in pag. 89. <q>To go forth in Man's
Power, <hi>in the Power of a Letter of the Scripture only,</hi>
is not ſafe. Yet again, pag. 87 upon <hi>Acts</hi> 17.
Here they hold <hi>Paul</hi> play in Reaſoning and Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<hi>Paul</hi> holds up Chriſt out of the Scriptures, <hi>and
the</hi> Jews <hi>do diſpute againſt Chriſt by the Scriptures;</hi>
And this is that that all the Learning of Man doth,
<hi>all his Knowledge in the Scripture doth but ſerve him,
to oppoſe the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>greater Knowledge in the
Scriptures,</hi> and the more Learning (if it be only of
Man) <hi>the greater Oppoſition unto Chriſt, and unto the
Spirit.</hi> Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> had LEARNING AND

TO OPPOSE THE TRUTH, THE POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER
AND LIFE OF THE SCRIPTURES.</q> And
laſtly, that we may not be too prolix, we ſhall content
our ſelves (in the over-looking many more) with this
Paſſage, in his laſt Teſtimony, pag. 71. upon <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25.
<q>There are that have devoted themſelves to the Law,
and the <hi>Letter</hi> of Scripture; There are others that
have their Life in the Creature; <hi>God will ſhortly draw
all Life unto himſelf, and all they that run after other

Theſe Paſſages, <hi>Reader,</hi> ſpeak for themſelves; and
which is more, ſo much for us, that till <hi>J. Faldo</hi> and

without being kick't and abus'd. His Carriage towards
me in this Particular, amongſt many Inſtances already
paſt, and yet to come, proves what I ſay.</p>
                  <p>In a Book of mine, called, <hi>The Spirit of Truth Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
&amp;c.</hi> in Anſwer to a <hi>Socinian,</hi> who ſeem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride

Faith in God, and Knowledge of the Scriptures, from
the Revelation and Operation of the Eternal Spirit, I
uſed theſe words, <q>But I aſſure them, they ſhall grope
in the Dark, till they come into the daily Obedience of
the Light, and there reſt contented to know only as
they Experience.</q> At this he ſcoffed; <hi>What know God
only as they experience? Can we experience his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency?
That</hi> W. P. <hi>of all others ſhould talk at this rate
is moſt ridiculous.</hi> To which he brings me in thus
anſwering, <q>'Tis Unchriſtian in <hi>John Faldo</hi> to aſſert the
right Knowledge of God, obtainable any other Way
then by Experience.</q> Here's my <hi>Reflection</hi> by way of
Conſequence, but where's my <hi>Argument?</hi> That he left
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41053:71"/>
behind, as being better able to jeer it, then confute
it; ſome ſhort Account of it I will give. <q>That it
is the Light or Spirit of God, that by its illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
giveth the right Knowledge of God, that ſuch
Knowledge never goes without Experience. Again,
The World without in its Make, Order, Perſervation,
Providences, his Powerful Work of Redemption
within prove what I writ:</q> But of this he takes no
notice. Now <hi>his Diſ-ingenuity</hi> thus far is two-fold,

when the Scope and End of my words went no farther
then <hi>every Man's particular Saving Knowledge of God,</hi>
with reſpect to his Repentance, Converſion and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

is one great thing experienced. Thirdly, The Scripture
is oftentimes an Inſtrument to that Experience. Laſtly,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41053:71"/>
The Spirit of God is the efficient Cauſe or Worker of the

by <hi>J. Faldo</hi> for doing ſo; but that he ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
me to exclude <hi>Reaſon,</hi> from Men in their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which is to render them Brutes, and becauſe
therefore unreaſonable, to be ſure moſt uncapable of
Experience (unleſs Men may Experience without their
Reaſonable or Underſtanding Part) is a Wrong that
would have drawn a whole Chapter of Railing from
him, had he been ſo ſerv'd by a <hi>Quaker.</hi> And for <hi>Faith,</hi>
how can a Man have it, and not know he hath it; and
which way may he poſſibly know it and not experience
it? As to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they may both be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                  <p>Two places more, and we leave this Chapter, in

If it be in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">My Anſw. pag. 87.</note> it was impertinent

in putting <hi>alway together</hi> in the <hi>Reply,</hi> which

the Teachings of God, and the Scriptures alwayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

tyes God alwayes to the Scriptures; that he cannot
ſpeak otherwiſe then by them, nor the Scriptures be
without him, which makes up the <hi>Falſe Doctrine</hi> I
charged upon him. But if he means that God ſpeaks
nothing contrary to his Mind declared in Scripture, and
the Scriptures nothing contradictory to the Mind of God,
I acquieſce; yet this Conceſſion not only brings him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Inſpiration;</hi> implying that we hold them to be
profitable as God is pleaſed to diſcover unto us, and
breath into our Hearts the true Meaning and Vertue of
them, for our Inſtruction and Comfort; and what ſhort
of this doth <hi>John Faldo</hi>'s Expreſſion import, that
makes the Teachings of the God above neceſſary to
render the Scriptures truly profitable unto any: And
what is this but to ſay with us, that they are of <hi>no

above unfold them, and brings our Souls into a ſenſe

<hi>Reader,</hi> I have often complain'd, and yet ſhall have
Cauſe enough of my Adverſary's unfair Dealing, in not

It is written, it is written,</hi> Mat. 4. To
which I gave this following Anſwer; <q>But neither will
this do his Buſineſs, and a Shame it is that this Man
ſhould bring theſe places to prove that <hi>the Scriptures
are Means whereby to reſiſt Temptation</hi> (which Rebuke
was the whole he recited) that concerned them not,
eſpecially this in Hand, unleſs he would have <hi>Faith</hi> to
be the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or Word of God in his Senſe,
which as it is abſurd, ſo it will by him be deny'd, ſince
he allows the Faith to be preferr'd before the Word of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41053:73"/>
God, therefore diſtinct from it, and conſequently not
the ſame with it. And ſhould we grant to him, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is not underſtood by the Word of God, but
the Scriptures; yet obſerve the fatal Blow his Cauſe
receives at his own Hand. Every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath
Faith; that Faith is above the Scriptures, therefore
<hi>every true</hi> Chriſtian <hi>hath ſomething in him above the
Scriptures.</hi>
                     </q> Again, <q>True Faith overcometh the
World, and quenches the fiery Darts of Satan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
Temptations; therefore not ſo properly the
Scriptures, as <hi>true Faith, which is preferred above
them,</hi> (by <hi>John Faldo</hi> himſelf) <hi>and which reſiſts Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and overcomes the VVorld,</hi> is, &amp;c. Once more,
the Juſt they live by Faith, but <hi>Faith is above the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
ſaith <hi>J. F. Therefore the Juſt live by that which
is above the Scriptures,</hi> and conſequently, the Scriptures
are not the Rule of Faith, for how can any thing be
ruled by that which is inferior to it? Thus much we get
granting to him, that the Scriptures are the Word of
God in the Text.</q> Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> tell me, of this
Argumentation what has he taken, <hi>what has he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to?</hi> Yet this man is deem'd worthy by the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of our Times, to act the <hi>Tertullus</hi> againſt the poor
<hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thoſe words, <hi>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the
Word of God,</hi> I told him then,  <q>We rejected his Gloſs;
for the <hi>spiritual Sword,</hi> as he ſayes, <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, muſt
be of the Narure of the reſt of the <hi>Armour</hi> mention'd
in that Chapter, that is, inviſible and Spiritual, which
the Bible or meer VVritings we know are not.</q> To
which let me add; that I know no Reaſon <hi>why the Shield
of Faith ſhould be preferred before the Sword of the spirit,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41053:74"/>
unleſs it be becauſe that's in the Verſe before this, if we
conſider them in an abſtract Senſe, or as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
For <hi>Above all,</hi> is not a preferring the <hi>Shield of
Faith</hi> in Dignity before the Sword of the Spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
their own Nature and Quality, but with regard
to the Creature. For, <hi>if Vnbelief enters, how can the
Loins be girt with Truth, the Breaſt arm'd with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
the Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel
of Peace, the Head covered with the Helmtt of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or the Enemy encounter'd with the Sword of the
Spirit? So that reſpecting <hi>Man,</hi> not reſpecting the
<hi>Dignity</hi> of the ſeveral parts of the Armour, <hi>Faith</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, or firſt neceſſary; for though God, Chriſt,
the Holy Spirit, Eternal Salvation, be all, or either of
them greater then Faith, as in themſelves, yet without
Faith no intereſt can be had in them. Wherefore our

about the Scriptures being the VVord of God falls to

that where-ever God is pleaſed to ſpeak by any

well be acknowledg'd to be a Means, by which
God ſcatters ſuch Doubts and Deſpondences, and
gives Power over Temptations, and that it may often

Proof of the Charge lies in theſe words, <hi>Traditions of

through Men's Ignorance of the true Intendment of
Scripture? And do not ſuch, as confidently think them
to be truly receiv'd from Scripture, as if they really
were ſo. But the Streſs lies here with J. F. His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
cannot bear a Scruting; and is as well nigh as ſhy
of a Search as <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> it ſelf. Though had <hi>John

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41053:76"/>
ſet the Authority of the Scriptures againſt the Inſpiration
of the Holy Ghoſt, at leaſt exclude the holy Inſpiration
from any ſhare in that Authority, and ſo do what he can to
ſhuffle out <hi>the Spirit from being concerned in the Authority
of the Scriptures;</hi> which is, if not the only, yet the greateſt
Proof of their Authorities, ſince it is chiefly by <hi>the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit in our ſelves that we know them to have
bin given forth by the Inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt in others,</hi>
as held both the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> our Famous <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and moſt Conſiderable <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> He ſpeaks as
if he affected Obſcurity, and aim'd only at jumbling
and intricating, inſtead of explaining the Matter. But
had we put the Spirit in Oppoſition to the Letter, it is
no more then what the Scripture hath done before us, as
<hi>H. Bullenger,</hi> that notable Reformer obſerves upon
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. <q>
                        <hi>The Spirit, </hi>ſaith he, is oppoſed to the
Letter, as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Circumciſion of the
Heart is the Circumciſion that conſiſteth in Spirit, not in
the Letter;</hi> And again, <hi>The Lord hath made us able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of
the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth
Life,</hi> 4 Dec. 8 Serm.</q> A notable Application to our
Purpoſe; but while we only ſo oppoſe them, as to
give the Preference to the Holy Spirit, J. F. falls foul
of us for a Pack of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> ſhutting out the Spirit,
at leaſt ſetting it aſide to exalt the Letter. But what
doth he mean by theſe Terms, <hi>Immediate Inſpiration?</hi>
for a <hi>Mediate Inſpiration</hi> I never heard of. Sure I am,
that <hi>Inſpiration</hi> is God's own Breathing into the Soul,
by which it hath Underſtanding given it, whether it be
of things written, or not written; and how that can be
done, and <hi>not immediately,</hi> I know not. If he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41053:77"/>
his impertinent Diſtinction of <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
for <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> we ſhall allow
him more then we can upon the other; for by <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Inſpiration</hi> or Revelation I underſtand ſuch daily
and common Viſion and Diſcovery to the Soul, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it in its general Station, reſpecting God and Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
By <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> ſuch as great Fore-Sights, or Divine
Proſpects, which give to fore-tell or propheſie things
to come, or decide ſome ſignal Controverſie, or very
ſpecial Caſe of Difficulty: The <hi>firſt</hi> is what I ſpeak of;
and do affirm, that neither can the Scriptures be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
our Souls fed and comforted, nor our Duties to
God rightly perform'd without it: The <hi>laſt</hi> is a Caſe
ſo peculiar, that all along it is plain, I never intended
it. But if by <hi>Immediate Inspiration,</hi> reſpecting us,
he underſtands, <hi>that from thence forwards we caſt off all
Scripture, as an antiquated, or inſignificant piece of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi>
(which are yet Words too Modeſt for his Malice
to father upon us, as I ſhall anon make appear) then doth
he wrong us and our Doctrine to an high Degree. And no
matter what he thinks of me, or what <hi>Names</hi> he may
pleaſe to call me (who is too far gone in his preſent <hi>sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick</hi>
Diſeaſe, to think any better of ſuch as I am) I ſhall
plainly ſet down what was my Meaning by the Words
he cavils at, viz. TRULY <hi>received thence,</hi> I hope, to
their Satisfaction, who will be more diſ-intereſted in their
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Doctrines</hi> TRULY <hi>owned and received from
Scripture,</hi> we mean ſuch holy Truths, as God by his
Spirit (inlightning our Underſtandings) hath given us
a <hi>true Diſcerning</hi> of to be ſuch, and thoſe are they
which we put in Oppoſition to Men's <hi>Carnal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:41053:77"/>
upon, and <hi>Imaginary Deductions</hi> from the
Scriptures, and not that we claſh the <hi>Spirit's Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
againſt the Scripture; for they harmonize, and bear
reciprocal Teſtimonies to each other: And this God,
that knows all Hearts, both knows to be our true Senſe
in the Matter controverted, and will one day abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prove to our <hi>Adverſary</hi>'s Eternal conviction. This,
I fear, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> will never ſwallow; and why? becauſe
it would choak him: Perhaps I muſt be a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocator,</hi>
and what elſe he pleaſeth; but wherefore?
becauſe it ſtrikes at his Honeſty, indeed Diſhoneſty;
for he had rather we were, what he ſayes, we are, then
receive a Contradiction by finding us otherwiſe, then
he hath ſo confidently repreſented us to be. So much
dearer is <hi>Humor, Pride</hi> and <hi>Worldly Credit</hi> to him, then
our being not ſo miſtaken as he thought for. Is this
Man like to make Converts, that firſt maims my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,

Dirt; or if one Senſe worſe then another may be had,
that (uſher'd in with a <hi>Rant,</hi> and wound up with a

This hath hitherto been his Practice, and we now go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both a Proof of it, and yet more evidently to clear
the Truth.</p>
                  <p>In that little piece of my Anſwer he cropt off from
the reſt, (for after his wonted manner, he thought
it not beſt for him to encounter it at large, but a ſnap

                  <p>For his Phraſe of <hi>Blaſpheming the Spirit of God in the

that he now playes the <hi>Canter</hi> with us, and
that ſhamefully, <hi>The Spirit of God</hi> IN <hi>the Scriptures!</hi>
a Scripture for that, I intreat him. You may ſee what a
<hi>Doctor</hi> he is, you that believe in him, that thinks, <hi>he
can claſp up the Spirit with his Bible.</hi> It ſeems thus <hi>far
John Faldo</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> agree; for the <hi>one thought
he could buy it of</hi> Peter, and the <hi>other implies he may have
it of his Book-ſeller.</hi> Indeed if I thought <hi>J. Faldo</hi> could
believe what he ſayes, I ſhould be the tenderer of him;
for Ignorance is to be pittied: But when he ſhall ſhut
the <hi>Spirit of God out of Men, and ſhut him up in the
Scripture, though it call Men the Temples or Tabernacles
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41053:78"/>
of God and his Spirit, whilſt it never calls it ſelf ſo, but
Holy Writings, or a Declaration of things certainly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
he is to be cenſur'd for his improper and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Terms, and the rather, becauſe his Charity is ſo
ſmall to others in Caſes more excuſable, and that no
Man acts the <hi>Doctor of the Sentences</hi> to others more
ſnappiſhly and imperiouſly then himſelf; however, I
ſhall be ſo favourable as to take his Words in this
Senſe (elſe I know not which way he will turn himſelf)
viz. <hi>The Spirit of God speaking</hi> (when it pleaſeth) <hi>by
the Scriptures,</hi> which brings him and his Cauſe unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
over to us.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee if <hi>J. F.</hi> can honeſtly faſten any of thoſe
fore-cited <hi>Epithetes</hi> upon <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Book; If he can,
we will condemn the Book as heartily, as J. F. traduceth
us in his. But if he ſhall be found to have wrong'd
W. S. God that lives forever will avenge our Innocency
upon him; which we deſire may extend no further
then to work him into true Repentance, and effectually
to vindicate us in the Underſtandings of the Miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

he ſtudies more then the Truth, or any thing elſe, next
to his making the worſt of ours. And now, <hi>Reader,</hi>
that this Proof is as lame as his former, and wholely as
ſilent to his Wicked purpoſes, conſider I entreat
thee, the Drift of this Man, as his Diſcourſe at large
manifeſts. Two things he had in his Eye, <hi>Firſt, to beat
People off from the Doctrines and Traditions of Men,</hi> in
the Senſe Chriſt once ſpoke thoſe words, to wit, <hi>not
the Scriptures, but Men's humane Interpretations of
them,</hi> with ſuch Forms and Worſhips as they had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Apoſtacy from the true Spirit of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
as theſe words, by J. F. purpoſely omitted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they lay between the two firſt Sentences,
which therefore make an abſolute Break, though he
makes none, do undeniably evince, to wit, <hi>VVeigh this
Truth all ye Prieſts and Profeſſors, and ponder it in your
Hearts; have you beheld Chriſt, and ſeen his Glory?
Have you felt his Power to take away your ſin? If yea,
then why do ye teach for Doctrine Men's Traditions.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
pag. 16. <hi>For they being from the Life that gave
forth Scriptures, their Vnderſtandings are darkened, and
they err, and know not the Scriptures nor the Power of
God.</hi> Laſtly, in the 14th page he hath theſe words,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41053:79"/>
                     <hi>All the vain Worſhips and Cuſtoms, which People at this
day are in, who yet abide in Forms and Traditions, are
all come up ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, and are after
Men's Traditions, and not after Chriſt. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of all hath been in Man's Imagination, and
hath been brought forth in his own Will and Wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all which, <hi>Reader,</hi> it appears, that he diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
between <hi>Men's Traditions</hi> and <hi>God's Tradition.</hi>
For <hi>firſt,</hi> how can he mean the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the <hi>firſt
Paſſage</hi> (the middle of which our Adverſary ſo wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dropt) when he implies, that from feeling the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Chriſt to take away Sin, Men would leave off
Teaching for Doctrine the Traditions of Men; making
them thereby ſinful, and a Sin to teach them, when
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> confeſſes, that upon the Spirit's moving and
giving us the underſtanding of Scripture we do allow
the Doctrines therein deliver'd, to be rightly preach'd.
In the <hi>ſecond Paſſage,</hi> he undeniably diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Scriptures rightly underſtood,</hi> and their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
of them to whom he wrote; Not knowing,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>the Scriptures, nor the Power of God,</hi> being darkned;
which imports, that truly to know and teach <hi>according
to the ſenſe of Holy Scripture,</hi> is a quite differing thing
from <hi>Teaching for Doctrine the Traditions of Men.</hi> Nor
is his <hi>third Paſſage</hi> leſs clear in the Point, pag. 14. ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
he explains what he means by thoſe offenſive Words to
<hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Ear, by <hi>ſuch Cuſtoms, Worſhips and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as were not of Chriſt,</hi> and that took their riſe ſince
the time of the Apoſtles, and proceeded from the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Will and Wiſdom of Man; therefore not the
Writings of either Prophets or Apoſtles, that were
before ſuch Apoſtacy, and which were given forth as they

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:41053:80"/>
The <hi>ſecond thing</hi> greatly in the Author's Eye, and
with which his Spirit ſeems to be preſt through the whole
Book, is this; <hi>Men ought to teach and preach to others
no further then they have a living Senſe or Experience
of what they ſo teach or preach:</hi> that this was his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by thoſe Words, <hi>Running into the Lines of what
others, have written;</hi> hear the following Words in his
Defence. <hi>How dare any of you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Name, or speak of his Glory, or of his Power,
ſeeing you have not beheld him yet made manifeſt in your
ſelves?</hi> Again thus, <hi>For</hi> John <hi>teſtified, that the giving
forth of the Law was by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth
came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 1. 17. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>Grace and Truth were come unto</hi> John <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,
and he had felt the Vertue of it, by which</hi> Moſes'<hi>s Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
was fulfilled in him.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Reader,</hi> his whole
ſcope was to inforce the Neceſſity of coming into the
Enjoyments of the Holy Ancients, and an Experiencing
of the Truth of thoſe Doctrines they declar'd, before
Men are fit to teach them unto others. And as this is
the Tendency of his Words, ſo does holy Scripture
ſtrongly warrant the ſame; Particularly <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> thus,
<hi>He that hath my Word, let him speak my Word faithfully;
What is the Chaff to the Wheat, ſaith the Lord? Is not
my Wordlike a</hi> FIRE, <hi>ſaith the Lord, and like a</hi> HAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER,
<hi>that breaketh the Rock in pieces? Therefore I am
againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that ſteal my Word
every one from his Neighbour,</hi> Chap. 23. Verſ. 28, 29, 30.
The Meaning of which notable place is plainly this,
Such as have God's Word to declare (which is known
from all Falſe Pretenders, who ſteal the Word from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41053:80"/>
their Neighbour, and then cry, he ſaith, as the 31th
Verſe expreſſeth, by the Reſemblance it bears to Fire,
a thing eaſily to be felt) let them faithfully ſpeak it.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe who ſteal and preach the Word or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that came from the Lord by and through another,
as if the Lord ſpake the ſame by them, unto whom the
Lord never ſpoak it; ſuch Prophets the Lord is againſt,
which ſtrikes <hi>J. Faldo</hi> dead, reſpecting his Pretence
for Preaching, who abundantly proves it to be his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that ſuch are as <hi>Good Miniſters</hi> as any, yea, the
only <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and the other but a Pack of giddy-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next place is in the Apoſtle's 2d Epiſt. to the
<hi>Corinthians.</hi> Chap. 10. Verſ. 15, 16. <hi>Not boaſting of
things beyond our meaſure, that is, of other Men's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but having Hope, that when your Faith is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that we ſhall be enlarged by you, according to our Rule
abundantly, to preach the Goſpel in the Regions beyond you,
and not to boaſt in another Man's Line of things made
ready to our Hands.</hi> Of this ſort of Boaſters is <hi>John
Faldo,</hi> who hath nothing for his Religion but the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bible, and but an uſurpt Title to that. <hi>Reader,</hi> take
notice, that all along <hi>J. F.</hi> hath made no Difference
between the <hi>Truths</hi> the Scriptures truly declare of, and
<hi>Man's dark and unregenerated Conceptions upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
about Truth and Error.</hi> Thereby confounding
that which in it ſelf is moſt clearly different, to the
end he may bring all thoſe Blows we give at Men's
Traditions and Doctrines (which they pretend to be
rightly deduced from Scripture, but in Reallity, are
their own Imaginations) <hi>to bear hard upon the Scriptures
themſelves, and thoſe Doctrines and Traditions that are
truly delivered by them;</hi> which is a wretched begging of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41053:81"/>
the Queſtion, that was not about the Scriptures, to
which he would turn it, but his and their way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
them, as if it were the ſame thing to decry
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as to diſclaim againſt <hi>J. F.'s</hi> falſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning them.</p>
                  <p>But he thinks he has quite done our Buſineſs, and ſav'd
himſelf from the Black Blemiſh of Forgery, by another
Teſtimony produced to the ſame purpoſe, which is this.
<hi>And reading in the Scriptures, that there were ſome who
met together, and exhorted one another, they obſerve and
do as near as they can what they read of the Saints Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and ſo conceive a Birth in the ſame Womb, and
bring it forth in the ſame Strength that others do, and in
the Ground it differs not,</hi> W. S. pag. 22. But what of
all this, <hi>J. Faldo?</hi> Can this Saying riſe higher then a
Reproof of thoſe who are but in the <hi>Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ,</hi>
whom the Scriptutes exhort us <hi>to turn away from:</hi>
But why was he ſo diſingenuous as to refuſe us our
Friends words at large, thereby making People believe,
that the Imitation reprov'd by W. S. concerns the holy
Life and Converſation of the Saints. For its not two
Lines before, that he tells us expreſly what ſort of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
he means, when he writes thus, <hi>And becauſe they</hi>
(Baptiſts) <hi>read of ſome that went into the Water, and

the</hi> Engliſh Browniſts <hi>or</hi> Independents <hi>at</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>more
then 30 Years ago, viz.</hi> Labour to Experience the Power
and Leading of the Spirit: It is very dangerous to reſt in
any thing that comes from the Creature, till you have the
Witneſs of the Spirit, which is not fleſhly, heady or empty;
but powerful, inward, and abides and ſettles the Soul. <hi>In

J. Faldo.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is a Paſſage in <hi>W. Dell's Tryal of Spirits,</hi>
writ, as I take it, while he was <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Cains Colledge
in Cambrige.</hi> 
                     <q>They, ſays he, who want Chriſt's Spirit,
which is the Spirit of Prophecy, though they preach the
EXACT LETTER of the Word, yet are FALSE
PROPHETS, and not to be heard by the Sheep. And
one Reaſon among many for this Aſſertion, was this,
<hi>Under the New Teſtament we are not to regard the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without the Spirit, but the Spirit as well as the Letter,
yea, the Spirit more then the Letter.</hi> And therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Chriſt ſhall deſtroy Antichriſt with the
Spirit of his Mouth, and the Brightneſs of his Coming.</hi>
He ſcarce (ſaith this Author) takes any notice of the
<hi>Letter,</hi> but calls the true Preaching of the Goſpel, the
Spirit of Chriſt's Mouth, or <hi>the Miniſtration of the
Spirit.</hi>
                     </q> His next Reaſon is this, <q>
                        <hi>They that preach only
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41053:82"/>
the outward Letter of the Word without the true Spirit,
they make all things outward in the Church, and ſo carry
the People with whom they prevail, only to outward things,
to an outward Word, to outward Worſhip, outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
outward Church, outward Government, &amp;c.
whereas in the true Kingdom of Chriſt, all things are
inward and spiritual; and all the true Religion of Chriſt
is written in the Soul and Spirit of Man, and the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is the only Book, in which God himſelf writes his new
Teſtament,</hi> pag. 19, 20.</q>

more relate to the Holy Scriptures, then that Spirit from
whom they came, to wit, <q>They are all upon the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Root, and in Darkneſs and Confuſion in their
Practice and Worſhip.</q> Now, Reader, What does
the Scripture practiſe, and whom, and how doth the
Scripture worſhip; if the word (<hi>they</hi>) relate to the
Scriptures, and not thoſe ſeveral ranks of Profeſſors to
whom he expreſly dedicated his Book? Yet further,
<q>That from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the
Feet the Image (that is, the ſeveral Sects) hath no
whole part in it, but is full of Putrefaction and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and every Branch rotten and deceitful, and no
good Fruit is found; <hi>for the bringing forth of all is from
the Heart that is deceitful and corrupted,</hi> which lies faln
and degenerated from God.</q> What Man, Reader,
that ever thought to have his Proofs examin'd, would
have dar'd to apply in the Author's Name theſe terms to
the Scripture, that ſo particularly and plainly relate to
Man in his fallen State. But pleaſe to conſider what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Authority he has for the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi>

have taken the VVhore's Cup, and do drink it:
And unto all thoſe is the Cup of God's Indignation
poured out, becauſe they are Baſtards, and not Sons.</q>
Upon which I query with <hi>J. F.</hi> who are the VVande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?
If the People; then the fore-going word, <hi>They,</hi>
of which the word <hi>Wanderers</hi> muſt be the Relative,
concern Profeſſors; and then all thoſe Terms before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
belongs not to the Scripture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſ-apply'd by our Enemy. But if he ſays VV. S.
meant the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> how could they be ſaid to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41053:83"/>
or drink the VVhore's Cup? And if the <hi>Whore's
Cup</hi> be the Scriptures (as J. F. makes W. S. to mean)
either the People drank up the Scriptures in the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or the Scriptures drank up themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> VVho are thoſe <hi>Baſtards,</hi> to whom the Cup
of God's Indignation is pour'd fourth? Certainly they
are <hi>Diſobedient Children,</hi> and not as <hi>J. Faldo</hi> would

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> Doubtleſs the Man is deſperate, and to me he
ſeems to have laid Violent hands upon himſelf to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
of his Reputation among Men, and his Soul in
the Eye of God; ſince after all this Injury to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Friend, he dares yet appear in ſo impudent a
Strain, as this following Paſſage makes him guilty of.
<hi>All this</hi> Penn <hi>KNEW to be true when he dared to
make ſuch Hypocritical Appeals to Delude the World,
Save the</hi> Quakers <hi>Credit, and Abuſe me as a Forger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Righteous God judge between us, whether I
writ otherwiſe then I knew, or he in affirming it, more
then he knew. My Appeals were ſolemn, in the Grief
of my Spirit, to ſee a Man arriv'd at that pitch of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as to pervert and forge about Sacred Things, even
while himſelf would paſs for a Miniſter of them; and
I can ſcarce think any Man ſo prejudic'd againſt us, as not
to conclude with me, that his Aim in this untrue Paſſage
(to ſay no more) was to bear People down, as to the
Honeſty of his Quotation, by the mighty Vehemence
and Confidence of his poſitive Charge againſt me, <hi>to
have known, what in Reallity I never knew, and to have
appeal'd hypocritically to God concerning our Innocency,
who did it in the Humility and Sincerity of my Soul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Man had no other way left him, to ſecure
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41053:84"/>
himſelf from the deſerv'd Imputation of Forgery or
wilful Perverſion, ſcarce a remove from it. But that by
which he would clear himſelf from it, faſtens it inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
upon him, and renders him one of the daringſt and
<hi>moſt harden'd Perverters</hi> I have ever yet met with in all
my Life.</p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Teſtimony</hi> he brought to prove our <hi>Oppoſition
of the Spirit to the Scriptures,</hi> and which he pretends to
juſtifie againſt my Explanation, was this, <hi>Of this ſort
are the Falſe Prophets, who have their Preaching from
Study, and other Men's Mouthes,</hi> charging me, that I
<hi>treacherouſly</hi> left out, <hi>or from the Letter, and not from the
Mouth of the Lord.</hi> But as I us'd no Treachery, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omitted it in Deſign, nor thought it Prejudicial to
his Cauſe, ſince my Anſwer, as himſelf hath tranſ-ſcrib'd
it, ſhews, that I underſtood it to be the Letter of the
Scripture, that was meant, from whence they ſtole their
Preaching, and not that they receiv'd it from the Mouth
of the Lord; ſo in the end it will prove more my own
Diſadvantage to have omitted it, then any Bodies elſe.
I ſhall ſet down my Anſwer, as he has tranſ-ſcrib'd it,
and his Reply, the equall'ſt Way of Judging.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The natural Purport of the Words, ſaid I, can be
no more then this; That though the Things declar'd
of in the Scriptures were the Word of the Lord to
the holy <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> as God's Mouth (not
his Mouth therefore) to the People <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yea, much
of it (mark) the Mouth of the Lord to us alſo; yet
for Men to ſay any part of it by rote, eſpecially if
they add (mark) <hi>their own Comments and Gloſſes, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from ſtudy,</hi> OF any part of the Scripture, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41053:84"/>
ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Hear the Word of the
Lord, and not in the ſame living Senſe, nor upon the
like Commiſſion, every ſuch one doth rob his Neighbour,
and ſteal his words.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is ſo much of my <hi>Anſwer</hi> as he tranſ-ſcribes,
which ſeems thus far ingenuous, that in three times a
larger <hi>Anſwer</hi> he has not tranſ-ſcrib'd one third of this;
perhaps he thought it not ſo much for his turn. But
before I ſet down his <hi>Reply,</hi> I ſhall find <hi>two Faults</hi>
with this recital; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he has (I will not ſay
<hi>treacherouſly,</hi> or that I knew he did deſign'dly miſ-give
my words, as he is frequently pleas'd to charge me)
falſly ſet down one part of my Anſwer; for in my Book
it is, <hi>If they add their own Comments and Gloſſes fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from ſtudy,</hi> TO <hi>any part of the Scripture,</hi> and
he tranſ-ſcribes it, <hi>Framed from ſtudy</hi> O F <hi>any part
of the Scripture;</hi> as if <hi>the studying</hi> O F <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and adding Men's own Gloſſes TO the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>were one and the ſame thing.</hi> All I ſhall ſay of it is
this, 'Tis a <hi>ſcurvy Miſtake,</hi> and looks very ſuſpitiouſly.
<hi>The ſecond</hi> is, That he has left out the moſt material
part of my Anſwer; The Streſs of which in brief lay
here, <q>
                        <hi>Parrots imitate Men;</hi> But if ſuch Creatures are
not therefore to be reputed Reaſonable, though the
Sentence be rational in it ſelf, becauſe it proceeds from
<hi>meer Imitation,</hi> and not a Principle of Reaſon; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is <hi>He</hi> a true Prophet, nor <hi>That</hi> the Word of the
Lord, <hi>with reſpect to that Prophet,</hi> who has not receiv'd
what he delivers from the immediate Word of God
himſelf, but by <hi>Hear-ſay, or meer Imitation.</hi>
                     </q> But of all
this part he takes no notice. I now come to his <hi>Reply,</hi>
which I will faithfully ſet down, and I hope, as clearly
enervate.</p>

by which God, who is a Spirit, utters forth his Mind
to his Children, thereby excluding the Word of God

                  <p>What does he mean by Mouth, or how does he take

other things may be in a ſenſe ſo ſtiled, when God

                     <p>The <hi>Eternal Word of God</hi> is the Mouth of God,

be different from the thing declar'd of. I cannot ſee

as <hi>J. Faldo</hi> accounts both a true Miniſter and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Society; much of this have we found at the hands
of the ſame Sort of Separatiſts. But firſt obſerve
(according as <hi>J. F.</hi> would have us underſtand it by his
Cenſure of us in a Caſe leſs obnoxious) the abſolute
Authority, perſonally aſſumed, and how much <hi>S. S.</hi>
acted the Pope (in <hi>J. F's</hi> Language) or arbitrary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
in this matter, that had been an earneſt Decryer of
the ſame Spirit in a more national Clergy. 2ly, It is
worth our Notice, that the matter <hi>Firſt</hi> charged was,
a (pretended) Untruth, relating to civil Commerce, from
which he cleared himſelf to his Adverſaries publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion:
But this was but the Preface, the Buſineſs is
behind; for he denyed <hi>the Locallity of Heaven and Hell,</hi>
that is, void of outward Place, as looking upon them,
to have a more ſpiritual Signification, and that the other
was too carnal, indeed <hi>Mahometan;</hi> and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Soul to have been <hi>breathed from God,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
aſſigning to it ſomething more of Divinity than the
uſual Opinion doth. For this and no more (as the
Pamphlet informs me, which recites the Reaſons of the
Excommunication) do they excommunicate him; yet
to colour the Buſineſs the better, like as <hi>J. F.</hi> does with
us, <hi>S. S.</hi> expells him their Society, <hi>for denying a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell at all, and as rendring the Soul God himſelf;</hi>
crying out, <hi>Satanical Devices, Atheiſm and Blaſphemy</hi>
There is one Paſſage this Captain took notice of, not
unfit to be obſerved by us, with Reſpect to the Uſe <hi>J. F.</hi>
makes of our Paper. <hi>S. S.</hi> in his Proem or Introduction
to his Excommunication uſed among other theſe Words,

                     <hi>That though Men may withdraw themſelves from the

                        </gap>dinances of God,</hi>
meaning, as I ſuppoſe, that his paſtroal Power could or
ſhould reach beyond <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or a further Place,
to excommunicate, <hi>Anathema, Meranatha</hi> an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp;c. But to this the Perſon ſo dealt with, anſwers,
and for ought I know more juſtifiably then <hi>J. F.</hi> can
pretend to do to us (for we allow no ſuch perſonal and
paſtoral Dignity and prerogative Power to any Man,
nor do we uſe any ſuch Forms of Excommunication)
ſiyes he, <hi>Have I therefore withdrawn my ſelf from the
People of God, becauſe I have withdrawn from you,</hi>
ARE NONE THE PEOPLE OF GOD
BUT YOUR SELVES? <hi>What are all thoſe you
are withdrawn from,</hi> ALL DAM NED?</p>
                  <p>This is ſuch an <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> as I am of
the Mind ought to trouble <hi>J. F.</hi> if the leaſt Grain of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty

                  <p>I will conclude this with telling my Reader, that for
no other Cauſe then what is expreſt, namely <hi>Opinion</hi>
(and that not very offenſive) this Perſon once accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
greatly of among them, being a Member of their
<hi>high Court of Juſtice,</hi> was firſt traduced, then excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
after this, complained of to the Powers,
by them, therefore deprived of his civil Employ; and
though they were his Debtors, both for Money lent,
and his Services done them (if we may credit his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Narrative) the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> ſo prevailed, that the

                     <hi>This ſaith</hi> W. P. pag. 103. is Scripture Language.

                  <p>A Fault ſo palpable, is ſoon found; VVho not ſtark

Is this Man fit to write of Religion that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſo boldly to pervert Men's VVritings? But he
thinks this will excuſe him, that <hi>I. P.</hi> meant ſuch
Worſhip as God was found in, and which Profeſſors
uſed about 4. 3, 44, &amp;c. but this is too boldly obtruded;
for, what Man can think <hi>I. P.</hi> ſo brutiſh, as to call
that Worſhip, in which Himſelf confeſſeth God to be
found, <hi>the City of Abomination? I. P.</hi> ſpoak of the
Nature of, and not the Viſibility of Worſhip; for
there is not a word of it in his Writings, ſo that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to maintain one Falſhood by another. But

                  <p>But a man's filling a Dung-Cart, &amp;c. is ſeen.
<hi>Therefore,</hi>

                  <p>Filling a Dung-Cart, &amp;c. is not Worſhip.</p>

                     <p>Beloved, I would have you ponder theſe things well:
If ye ſet up Ordinances, &amp;c. <hi>ſo as to build and reſt in
them, ye do make Idols of them, or at beſt, you play the
Babes and the Children with them, by reſting alwayes on
ſuch Crutches and Go-bies, and never come to be Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
much leſs as Fathers in Chriſt, pag.</hi> 562. And
truly, with ſome men herein lies the Top or Quinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
of their Religion, <hi>making ſuch ado about Shadows
&amp; Figures and Reſemblances, and they let the Truth, the
Subſtance, the thing paſs, and regard it not; foraſmuch
as they are ſo zealous and hot about Forms.</hi> But if they are
by any drawn up to ſpeak of the Subſtance, <hi>they are
as men loſt, cold and heartleſs;</hi> which is a plain Evidence
to me that they <hi>prefer the Shadow before the Subſtance,
being meerly exerciſed about Childiſh things, and are
not willing to come up to the Truth, to the Excellencies
and Glories, of what Baptiſm and other Ordinances ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
&amp;c.</hi> p. 560.</p>

                     <p>Ordinances are <hi>Vails,</hi> Man's Miniſtry is a Vail, if

not within the Vail.</hi> Theſe outward things are a
Vail, <hi>a Table made a Snare;</hi> but when we are <hi>turned
to the Lord the Vail ſhall be taken away.</hi> All Man's
Teaching, Wiſdom, &amp;c. makes the Vail the thicker:
Thoſe that only feed upon the Vail, upon outward
Things, in which God may appear, <hi>their Life ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi>

                     <p>The Deſign is to cupple the Lord and Ordinances
together; and we cannot endure to hear of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them. Swear by the Lord, and ſwear by Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,
ſo we have but Ordinances we are well; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from the fleſhly Form and Appearance we do
promiſe our ſelves, and ſo like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> hanker af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Fleſh-Pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though they had as good
Meat in the Wilderneſs: So though God offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> tell you, they cannot find God in
ſuch Forms, but find him abundantly good in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and though he be gone out of the Temple, yet
they find him in their Hearts, they preſs you to wait till
God appear to you in the Spirit; O, ſay you, I can never
believe it, that God ſhould do it without an Ordinance.
This is to ſay, that the Fleſhly Form doth add ſomething
to God, who being all in all, is ſufficient without it—You
are like a Man that is kept up with Cordials, not to
be compared with him that is in a Way of Recovery,
when you want the Phyſitian it is as much as your Life
is worth; and the Cordial if it be long a fetching you
begin to faint; you have not your Strength with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, but in Cordials without you; So is the
Caſe between you that live upon Ordinances, and
they that live upon Chriſt in the Spirit; Chriſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41053:106"/>
is never in a Journey, or to fetch a great Way
off.</p>

               <p>OUr <hi>Adverſary</hi> endeavours to ſtrengthen his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Charge conſidered in the former Chapter, by
proving our Denyal of each Ordinance in particular.
He begins in his other Book with the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> His
Proofs, as he calls them, were theſe, <q>And their Call
to the Miniſtry we deny which is Mediate, <hi>J. Parn.
Shield,</hi> p. 16. Alſo <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his <hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi> p. 45.
But who can witneſs an Immediate Call from God,
and ſpeak as they are moved from the Holy Ghoſt, and
ſuch travel from place to place, having no certain
Dwelling-Place;</q> This Miniſtry we own and witneſs.</p>
               <p>Now, without reporting one Word of my Anſwer,
he concludeth his firſt Paragraph, concerning <hi>J. Parnels</hi>
Words, thus: <hi>Having this Charge confeſſed there needs
no further Debate.</hi> O diſingenuous Man! What! On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeat the Charge, and the pretended Proof out of
<hi>J. P.</hi> without inſerting any Thing of my Defence or
Explanation, and then cry, <hi>having this Charge confeſſed
there needs no further Debate.</hi> Poor Brag! yet nimble
and notable Way of contracting Controverſie indeed:

                     <hi>To my Proof of a Call by men, W. P.</hi> ſayes nothing;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41053:107"/>
                     <hi>but that he may not ſeem to have nothing to ſay, he tells us</hi>
                     <q>It is not, Go ye forth into all the World and preach the
Goſpel, that belongs unto all Men, no more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Princes ſend Ambaſſadors to Princes with their
Credentials, that therefore every Man ought to do the
like in Imitation, without conſidering neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</q>
(thus far <hi>W. P.) Did you ever meet with
ſo ignorant and impertinent an Anſwer? Did ever
any of us take thoſe Words for our only Call? Or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
we had a Call thereby, to preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>

                  <p>VVhy ſo much Contempt? I have hitherto thought
that <hi>Chriſt's Commiſſion to his Apoſtles</hi> had been pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you to be a <hi>Succeſſive</hi> Commiſſion; if neither the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> within, nor the <hi>Scriptures</hi> without, give
not that Call? what doth? It had much more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>J. F</hi> to declare what he meant by his <hi>mediate Call,</hi>
and not to ask, <hi>if ever any met with ſo ignorant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
an Anſwer.</hi> But let this ſuffice that he denies
that any of them pretended a <hi>Call or Authority from
Chriſt's Commiſſion to his Diſciples to preach, &amp;c.</hi> Next,
That be can only mean by a <hi>mediate Call,</hi> that of the
People, ſince he had excluded a <hi>Call by the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and the Scriptures without:</hi> But becauſe the Call of a
People is neither that which qualifieth, nor authorizeth
any Man in himſelf without the Commiſſion of God's
Spirit in a Man's ſelf, it is the Commission immediately
received from God's Spirit, and proper Qualifications
that make the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and not the Deſire of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that is an Invention hatcht in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereby as
well blind <hi>Phariſees</hi> as true Diſciples; baſe <hi>Hirelings</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:41053:107"/>
as Godly Shepherds may be made Miniſters. There is
this further <hi>lazy End</hi> in it, that being once called by
any People, they think themſelves only obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
there, where they may take <hi>their Eaſe,</hi> unleſs, a
<hi>fatter Benefice</hi> preſent it ſelf, at which they have been
alwayes wont to catch with Greedineſs, ſtill with this
Deſign, that they might live with more worldly Peace
and Fatneſs. This was one of thoſe Doors by which the
Apoſtacy crept in; for the whole VVorld God's Field
or Vineyard, and ſuch as he calls to Labour, neither
will nor ought to be limitted by men, but alone, by the
good Husbandman, who has called them into his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.
But he proceeds.</p>

take, Reader, a Paſſage he cites out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Book, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi> which doubtleſs he reputes very hetrodox
or he would never bring it to prove a Charge contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch Matter as he counts ſo. <q>Thou [the Prieſt]
art corrected by the Scripture, and the Apoſtle corrects
thee, who ſaid, I have not received it of Man, nor by
Man, and bid others look at Jeſus, the author of their
Faith;</q> 
                     <hi>Their Writings,</hi> ſaith <hi>J. Faldo, are abounding
with Matter of this Nature;</hi> So much the better ſay I;
for it is old Scripture Doctrine, and <hi>J. Faldo</hi> gives us
plainly to infer by his Diſlike of this Paſſage, that he
maintains a Miniſtry received <hi>of man and by man,</hi> and
that People ought to look unto them, and not to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
the Author of their Faith. If this be one of <hi>J. F</hi>'s
Chriſtian Ordinances, as his Diſcourſe evidently makes
it, I hope, my Reader will the leſs wonder at thoſe hard
Names he gives us in it; for the plain Engliſh of his
Charge againſt us is this, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>deny the Miniſtry
that is of man, or by man, therefore they deny the Goſpel-Miniſtry.</hi>
Poor Man! what a paſs hath he brought his
Affairs to? Indeed I pitty him, and fear the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

ſince they both <hi>uſe Scripture, preach Scripture, and call

things which concern Redemption and Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that he draws ſorth by his holy Spirit, indues

Darkneſs to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi>
we own, honour and love, and only deny and reject
that Miniſtry which is <hi>by the Will, Study or Acquiſition

with the Effectual Operation of the Word of
God in themfelves, are wholy dark as to thoſe things
which relate to the true Miniſtry, not knowing what
they deny nor whereof they affirm; which doth not
edifie, but hazard the immortal Souls of Men: And
as they want the Inſpiration of the Almighty, to inſtruct
them, ſo (being Strangers to the Work of God in

Divine Power from on high) there proceeds no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

Theſe words, <hi>The Spirit the only Teacher,</hi> he often
flings up as words indigeſtible by his foul and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

a <hi>Goſpel-Church is one whoſe Order and Frame is

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41053:117"/>
                     <hi>God's Legal Church.</hi> It will alſo follow, that for above
1200 Years together, ſince Chriſt's time there
hath been <hi>no Goſpel-Church, yet Goſpellers,</hi> as their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
have called them, which were to grant to the

<hi>either</hi> be the Goſpel-Church, <hi>or not</hi> the Goſpel-Church;
<hi>If not the Goſpel-Church, then not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>

that could not be, becauſe ſhe fled from <hi>Antichriſt:</hi>
If the Goſpel-Church, then may a Church be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel

were ſynonimous, or of equal force; whereas
the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called in Scripture <hi>The Power of God to
Salvation,</hi> from that Spiritual Redemption it effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
worketh in them that receive it, from the
Bondage of Corruption, under which they have
fruitleſly laboured; which is the Reaſon, and a good
one too, why it ſignifieth <hi>Glad-Tidings;</hi> ſince nothing
can be more Joyous to a weary and heavy-loaden Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then to be eaſed of his former Iniquities, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,

Heavenly and Everlaſting Goſpel; which worthy

not a Goſpel-Church, when met together on the Day

and many baptized by the One Spirit into the One
Body of true Goſpel-Fellowſhip, before ever thoſe

External Order is mentioned: Nay, at this rate,

if yet one may be excepted; for if <hi>External Order

none of my words; I will report my Anſwer, both

                  <p> 
                     <q>The ſingle Power of the Almighty may both ſtrike
Aſtoniſhment and give Refreſhment where the Words
utterred are not always underſtood; ſince he frequently
doth both without them: <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Inward
Senſe</hi> are two Things; for the <hi>Devil</hi> may ſpeak the
beſt Words in the Bible, and be an Undiſcovered
<hi>Devil ſtill,</hi> except by this Divine Light, Power and
Spirit he be inwardly manifeſted, conſequently a
right Senſe may be had, where Words may not be
underſtood, which [Senſe] is the <hi>one Tongue to the
Children of Light;</hi> yet we do not only decry all
deſigned Obſcurity, by Praying and Preaching in
Unknown Languages, but with the Apoſtle ſay, That
<hi>we chuſe rather by far to speak in a Known Tongue,</hi>
as well as have the Senſe of our Spirits: Nor did ever
any <hi>Quaker</hi> yet pretend to be moved to pray in
an Unknown Language whilſt he was Maſter of that

which was well known to the People. Since then
we do not affect obſcurity, the Caſe of the <hi>Papiſts</hi>

or that he <hi>had not the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in

<hi>A Man may Bleſs, Praiſe and give Thanks to God in

a Perſon ſhould be acted by another Spirit then the
Spirit of God and the Apoſtle, for my own part I

cannot ſee. In ſhort, The Apoſtle tells us, That
<hi>Tongues are for them that believe not,</hi> verſ 22. But
our Friend ſpoak among them that believed; and
though they did not all know what her bare words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
yet they might be and were ſenſible of the
Divine Power in which ſhe ſpoak, which gave a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Refreſhment unto them of that Aſſembly, that
were acquainted with it; otherwiſe all Fellowſhip in
Spirit muſt be renounced: But 'tis to be any thing <hi>J. F</hi>'s

Caſe a more allowable Witneſs then <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> who
have ſeen Sinners ſtruck, the Weak ſtrengthned, and
the Strong confirmed at the hearing of the Truth of God
declared in a Language they could not underſtand;
The divine Power and Vertue went forth, and they
were judged, comforted or confirmed in themſelves,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41053:122"/>
and they no Fools (though <hi>J. Faldo calls ſuch things
Fooleries and Pupppet-Playes</hi>) To deny this is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<hi>Spiritual Fellowſhip in the Ground of it; and to
center in this Atheiſtical Notion,</hi> That all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God comes in by our carnal Eyes and Ears;
that is, What others have written, and what others
have told me, that I believe, and therefore I believe,
and not from the Teſtimony of this Infallible Spirit of
God in my ſelf; which Credulity renders him more like

                  <p>If this be done, <hi>Erit hic mihi magnus Apollo;</hi> If to
<hi>ceaſe from Man</hi> be not falſe Doctrine, then <hi>not to hear
Man</hi> is no falſe Doctrine; for <hi>Man</hi> is taken in the
ſame ſenſe in both places; For as God never intended
by <hi>ceaſing from Man,</hi> that they ſhould not regard his
<hi>Prophets,</hi> who were Men, when they came to declare
his VVill; ſo neither did <hi>G. F.</hi> intend that Man ought
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41053:124"/>
not to be heard when he comes on God's Errant or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in the Name of the Lord, but <hi>meer Man,</hi> Man
in his Natural Capacity and Ability without the Holy
Spirit and Power of God, which is but a carnal, humane
and worldly Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>To ſay we only <hi>preach the Light</hi> is no more then to
report, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>preach Chriſt;</hi> for our Doctrine
directs People to the Knocks of Chriſt, the true Light,
at the Door of the Soul, who is the Saviour, Redeemer
and Preſerver of them that believe in him, and keep
his Commandments. But that we ever ſaid, <hi>That it
was only preached to; yea, and the only Obeyer of ſuch
Preaching,</hi> is as falſe as any Thing that can be ſaid. He
tells us he proved it; I will give the ſtrongeſt Paſſage
he brought, <hi>J. Parn. Shield,</hi> &amp;c. Epiſt. <q>
                        <hi>To the Light
of God in all your Conſciences I ſpeak:</hi>
                     </q> Very well;
and what then? Is the Light therefore preacht to,
taught or inſtructed, when he only <hi>appealed to the Light</hi>
in all their Conſciences, concerning the Truth of what
he ſaid, as the Apoſtle did? <hi>To the Light I ſpeak,</hi> that
is, <hi>To the Light I direct my ſelf, To that I make my
Appeal, if what I write be not true? for what ſoever
is reproveable is made manifeſt by it,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 13.
This Conſtruction is Natural, Our Adverſary's forced;
for nothing is more common with us in General, and
that Author in particular, then to turn People to the
Light, preſſing their Conformity to the Reproofs and
Inſtructions of it, alwayes reſpecting it as given us of
God to be our true, certain and conſtant Teacher, and
alwayes have we been reproacht by ſuch as <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
for doing ſo. But above all, that this Paſſage ſhould
be brought to prove <hi>the Light is the Obeyer</hi> of ſuch
Doctrines and Inſtructions, who is the <hi>Author</hi> of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41053:124"/>
them, is an Abſurdity that reflects <hi>great Ignorance,</hi> or
<hi>ſomething worſe</hi> upon our Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>We have already declared our Faith ſo freely and

                  <p>The firſt Thing our <hi>Adverſary</hi> charged upon us in his
former Book was our <hi>Denyal of Goſpel-Prayer,</hi> to prove
which he cited <hi>W. Smith,</hi> who in his <hi>Catech.</hi> p. 107.
ſpoak againſt Prayers of Man's forming, in his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
VViſdom to be performed at his own Time, and
in his own Will; which I anſwered thus.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems then, that what Prayer <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Paſſage
reflects upon, is <hi>Goſpel-Prayer</hi> in <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Account:
Of this he takes no notice; he might think it is his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſt,</hi>
but I am ſure it was not his <hi>Honeſty</hi> to omit it;
for it was to entitle Prayers hateful to God, <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that
he might have his Will of us, in making the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that we deny Goſpel-Prayer; he was far from the
Carriage of a worthy and generous Adverſary in this,
that knowing how apt many are to receive any Charge
againſt us, would have acted deliberately and faithfully,
as one concerned by the Conſtraint of Conſcience, when
he (alaſs) ſent his many Charges as falſe as black, to
incenſe the Ignorant and Credulous againſt us, Revenge
for the Loſs of ſome Hearers, and that which follows,
animating him to this Unchriſtian Eſſay.</p>

                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:41053:126"/>
But he proceeded thus; That <hi>we own no Prayer
that is not by immediate Inſpiration and Motion of the
Spirit, and without the Vſe of our Conception and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of our Underſtanding.</hi> He brought two or three
Teſtimonies to confirm this <hi>Limb</hi> of his Charge; I
avoided reporting them by confeſſing the Matter; my
Buſineſs was therefore to mantain our Aſſertion, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to which I produced <hi>John</hi> 4. 24. <hi>The Worſhip of
God is in the Spirit and in the Truth,</hi> which he left out,
and from thence I gave the Argument by him repeated,
which he is pleaſed to call <hi>Witleſs and Truthleſs, as if</hi>
ſayes he, <hi>the Vnderſtanding Conceptions and Will of man
in Prayer muſt needs exclude the Motion of the Spirit,
or the Motions of the Spirit exclude them.</hi> But this <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
we will eaſily ſcatter; for if Man offer up his own
Conceptions, he cannot be ſaid to offer up what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by the Holy Ghoſt, by whom alone God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cry, <hi>Abba Father;</hi> for by Man's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
I mean what ſimply proceeds from man,
and where any man prayes ſuch Conceptions, he muſt
needs exclude the Injections and Motions of the holy
Spirit, and offer up an unclean Sacrifice; elſe there
would be no difference between the Prayers of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and the wicked.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Will of man in Prayer</hi> was not mentioned in the

in <hi>his own Power, and how, and when he pleaſeth,</hi> we

man is ſubjected;</hi> That is properly done in the Will of
Man, which is done at Man's Diſpoſal, or is in Man's
Power to perform; but it is not within the Compaſs of
Man's Will to offer up a ſpiritual Prayer, conſequently,
it belongs to the holy Spirit to furniſh Man with that
Capacity: So that by the <hi>Will of man</hi> we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>Will ſubjected,</hi> but the Will <hi>abſolute,</hi> and that
we exclude. The Will of Man in that Caſe is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in the Will of the Spirit, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Life was ſwallowed up in Chriſt; <hi>It is not I</hi> Paul <hi>that
live, but</hi> Chriſt <hi>in me; It is not I,</hi> Paul, <hi>that pray, but
the Spirit that prayeth in me;</hi> that is, <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>live by
and through the Life of Chriſt Jeſus, and in Subjection
to him; and I</hi> Paul <hi>pray by and through the Spirit, and
in Subjection to its holy Motions.</hi> I diſtinguiſh between
things being done <hi>contrary</hi> to the VVill of Man, and
<hi>not according</hi> to the VVill of man; for <hi>Paul</hi> might pray
not according to his own VVill, but the Mind of the
Holy Spirit, and yet not pray <hi>contrary</hi> to his own VVill,
becauſe reſigning of his own Will unto the Power and
Leadings of the Holy Spirit (To be acted by that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he receives a new Will, even the Will of the holy
Spirit) he does not reſiſt or act contrary to the Will
of the Spirit, though not according to his own
Will.</p>
                  <p>But for our Adverſary to ſay <hi>we deny the Vſe of our
Vnderſtanding in Prayer,</hi> is a great Miſtake, if not a
Slander, That which I objected againſt was an other
VVord by him carelefly or deſignedly omitted, to wit,
the DIRECTION of our Underſtanding; for
there is as much Difference between the USE of our
Underſtanding and DIRECTION of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
as between a <hi>Maſter</hi> and a <hi>Servant</hi> as to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41053:127"/>
                     <hi>command</hi> &amp; <hi>obey,</hi> Underſtanding is alwayes made Uſe of
by the holy Spirit in Prayer; for without it there would
be no Subject for the Spirit to act or work upon. But
the <hi>Direction</hi> of our Underſtanding in Prayer, is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excluſive of the <hi>Direction</hi> of the Holy Spirit, for there
cannot be two <hi>Directors;</hi> Beſides, if the <hi>Direction</hi>
in Prayer, be aſcribed to the Underſtanding, there is
nothing left that may be attributed to the Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſay we, <hi>The Vnderſtanding is not to direct, but to
be directed in Prayer</hi> to Almighty God by his own holy
Spirit, according to that notable Paſſage, Rom. 8. 26, 27.
<hi>The Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities, for we KNOW
NOT what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the
SPIRIT IT SELF MAKES INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSION
for us with Groanings which cannot be
uttered, and he that ſearcheth the Heart knoweth what
is the Mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

                  </p>
                  <p>I offered Eight Arguments in Defence of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

Conſequence.<note place="margin">See my Anſw. pag. 133.</note> Seven then of my

Prayer without the Leading of God's Spirit is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

                  <p>
                     <hi>Again;</hi> If no Prophecy or Preaching was to be of old

                  <p>Having his Leave, I hope he will not be angry if I
take him at his Word; but before I proceed, I cannot

                  <p>Now lets ſee wherein I have wronged him. I will
obſerve every Variation; The <hi>Firſt</hi> lyeth between the

but this is not one Step to Forgery. The <hi>next</hi> lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe two Paſſages, <hi>although respecting their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they deſerve a more Evangelical Denomination,</hi>
and his Saying, <hi>although that Subſtantial and Eſſential
Part and Qualification of them, and their Reſpect to a
Mediator will require a Denomination more Evangelical;</hi>
the Difference lyeth here; firſt, that I have put but the
VVord <hi>Subſtance</hi> in the room of <hi>Subſtantial Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Qualification, their Respect to a Mediator;</hi> wherein I
conceive I have not wrong'd his matter; for the ſubſtance
of the Morral Ordinances, &amp; the Subſtantial or Eſſential
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41053:130"/>
Part or Qualification of the Morral Ordinances are
<hi>equivalent:</hi> The Difference only lyeth that I did not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
his <hi>four</hi> Terms, when one would ſerve, but uſed
the VVord Subſtance, as carrying in it the import of
the reſt; For the Moral Ordinances <hi>Respect to a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi>
I ſay, they either reſpect the Mediator from the
Subſtance or Circumſtance of them, not the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to be ſure, therefore the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and that
VVord I uſed in the Place of <hi>Subſtantial</hi> or <hi>Eſſential,</hi>
as before. I cannot yet ſee where the Forgery lyeth;
but let us proceed; The <hi>next</hi> Variation lyeth between
<hi>will require</hi> and <hi>deſerve.</hi> Now I know not any VVrong
I did him in ſaying, <hi>thoſe morral Ordinances deſerve,</hi>
inſtead of <hi>thoſe morral Ordinances will require.</hi> The
harſher Word of the two is in his own Quotation; There
be yet <hi>two Faults</hi> more that I have committed that help
to the Forgery in my Adverſaries Opinion; The <hi>one</hi> is
this, I cited it <hi>a more Evangelical Denomination</hi> inſtead
of <hi>a Denomination more Evangelical;</hi> The other was
this, inſtead of <hi>Goſpel or Chriſtian Ordinances,</hi> I did
only ſet down <hi>Chriſtian Ordinances.</hi> All theſe things
conſidered, I cannot believe theſe Omiſſions are able to
ſtain my <hi>Credit</hi> in the Judgment of any ſober Reader,
though <hi>J. Faldo</hi> tells me, <hi>They are enough to ſtain any
man which is not all black already.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This miſerable Shift and cauſleſs Cry of <hi>Forgery,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to amaze &amp; divert the Reader from calling upon
him for a more <hi>ſerious Reply</hi> to the Uſe I made of his
own Doctrine againſt himſelf, cannot take me off from
perſuing my Advantage; for I think thoſe Omiſſions ſo
little to his Prejudice, that the inſerting what I left out,
would, if poſſible, have made more to my Purpoſe.
The Uſe I made of it was this:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41053:131"/>
Firſt, That a Miniſtry grounded internally upon the
(ſpecial) Grace and Gifts of God, externally upon the
Scriptures of Truth. <hi>2ly,</hi> That a Well-ordered Church
conſiſting of Religious Members, preaching, praying,
and that ſcripturally too, are by him called Chriſtian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and made natural to all Nations before Chriſt's
viſible Coming; and conſequently, there was the
<hi>Thing Chriſtianity</hi> before the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chritianity,</hi> which
pleads our Cauſe againſt his firſt Chapter and his groſs
Contradiction to himſelf. <hi>3ly,</hi> Thoſe he calls Natural
Ordinances, and that are of univerſal Obligation, are
far more ſubſtantial and neceſſary to Salvation then thoſe
two of <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> upon which
he more peculiarly beſtoweth the Title of <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> Since
no Man can ever be ſaved without the one, I mean <hi>thoſe
Natural Ordinances,</hi> as he calls them, grounded inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
upon the Grace and Gifts of God, and any Man may
be certainly ſaved without the other that he ſo peculiarly
calls <hi>Chriſtian Ordinances, viz.</hi> Water-Baptiſm and the
Supper.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, his Citation hinders me no more of this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
then mine he excepteth againſt; for if the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
and Eſſential Part and Qualification of them,
and the Respect to a Mediator</hi> will require them to be
Chriſtian Ordinances (that Part I left out, and for which
he quarreld me) what Reaſon can there be for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me a <hi>Forger,</hi> and telling the World, that <hi>I firſt
cut off his Matter, and then tell him of ſelf-Contradiction,</hi>
when the Words omitted give a further Weight to my
Conſequences, and juſtifie them beyond all Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For if theſe Ordinances be <hi>Morral, naturally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging</hi>
with all, <hi>Goſpel and Chriſtian from their Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and Eſſential Qualification, and the Reſpect to a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41053:131"/>
Mediator,</hi> then there muſt needs have been <hi>Chriſtian
or Goſpel-Ordinances from the beginning of the World.</hi>
In ſhort, Since he denys not my Conſequence upon that
Citation I made; and that we have ſhown the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be little, and what there was to make for me,
I think I may well conclude, that my former Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was found. Thus much for this Cavil. He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on.</p>

J. Faldo <hi>ſayes nothing: So that he ſpoak Truth but by
halfs; that is, what he ſaid was</hi> no Anſwer, <hi>yet it was
briefly ſaid. However, I do affirm, that</hi> Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<hi>is therefore</hi> Legal, <hi>becauſe Chriſt is not its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator;
for the Legal Diſpenſation came by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>but the Evangelical by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>not his Diſciples;
and this not coming by Chriſt, it cannot be Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
conſequently</hi> no Goſpel-Ordinance. <hi>Beſides, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that it is Evangelical becauſe he is not adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
for Chriſt is the alone Adminiſtrator; of all things
relating to his own Kingdom, the Temple-Worſhip
Altar, Circumciſion, Baptiſm, &amp;c. are inviſible, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerabel

and we are to ſuppoſe, that he commanded them to
Baptize with his own Baptiſm; therefore not with
Water. <hi>Next,</hi> Becauſe theſe Words, <hi>Go, Teach,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41053:133"/>
Baptizing,</hi> being ſome of the laſt words <hi>Matthew</hi>
reports him to have ſpoken while in the VVorld;
they muſt need have relation to that Saying which
<hi>Luke</hi> recordeth in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. to have fallen from him
immediate before his Aſcenſion, viz. <hi>And being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
together with them, he commanded, that they
ſhould not depart from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but wait for the
Promiſe of the Father, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye have heard
of me; For</hi> John <hi>truly baptized with Water, but ye ſhall
be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many dayes hence.</hi>
I ſay, the other Paſſage in <hi>Matthew</hi> muſt needs have
relation to theſe words, inaſmuch as they are by two
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> recorded to have been ſpoken immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before his Aſcenſion, it being within four Verſes of
this Paſſage, that <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>He was taken up
out of their Sight.</hi> For in this part of <hi>Luke</hi>'s Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
the Commiſſion given us by <hi>Matthew</hi> is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
omitted, which doubtleſs was ſpoken at the ſame
time; for we frequently find, That what one <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi>
omits the other ſupplieth; Therefore I read the
words thus, John <hi>indeed baptized with Water, but ye
ſhall be Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt; Then Go, teach
all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Unto all this he is
ſo ſilent as if there had been no ſuch thing obſerved.
My <hi>third Exception</hi> againſt Water-Baptiſm, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Text, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28 <q>That the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>That <hi>Baptiſm with Water</hi> may be <hi>into the Name of</hi>
the Father, is not ſober, unleſs it could baptize <hi>into the
Nature of the Father;</hi> for nothing leſs then <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is wrapt up in the Text: Beſides, that it is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Spirituallity of Chriſt's Miniſtration and
Kingdom, that he ſhould make Water-Baptiſm two
thirds of his Commiſſion, which Men may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with, and yet be as great Strangers, yea, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, as the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
of Men. And admitting, that by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
is to be underſtood the <hi>Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet
is it <hi>Heterodox</hi> with a Witneſs, to ſay, That <hi>a Man
may be baptized into them, and yet remain unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ungrafled into Chriſt;</hi> for what is it but to ſay,
<hi>That to be baptized by the Holy Ghoſt, is not to ſanctifie
Men, nor graft them into Chriſt;</hi> for ſuch hath been his
Careleſneſs in this Expreſſion, that he hath not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized
what Gift Men may have, and not be ſanctified
or grafted into Chriſt, but plainly denyes in general
Terms, <hi>the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt to be the ſame
thing with ſanctifying and grafting Men into Chriſt:</hi>
So many as were Baptized into Jeſus Chriſt were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into his Death; was this done by Water? where
is <hi>J. F</hi>'s Figure now he caſt to abuſe the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28? Again, As many as have been Baptized into
Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. I would fain

putting on of Chriſt; ſuch eaſie putting on of Chriſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41053:134"/>
will fall hard one day upon ſuch as he and the like
<hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But why ſhould I expect a better Account

                  <p>Many things are expreſſed by the Word Baptiſm, yet

                  <p>If he had ſaid one <hi>ſhadowy</hi> Baptiſm, it had been better
expreſſed, for that he himſelf elſewhere acknowledges
it to be; however, his <hi>one proper Baptiſm</hi> is not the
Apoſtle's <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. unleſs he will make
the Baptiſm of Water, and the Baptiſm of the Holy
Ghoſt to be but one and the ſame Baptiſm; if he can,
he will perform an impoſſibility; if he cannot, there
will be two Baptiſms, <hi>John's proper</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
<hi>improper Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>J. F.</hi> will have them contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht.</p>
                  <p>Now which of theſe two is the Evangelical and
Durable Baptiſm; the one the <hi>Figure,</hi> the other the
<hi>Subſtance;</hi> the one the <hi>Fore-runner,</hi> the other the <hi>Thing
Fore-runned?</hi> May we not ask of Water-Baptiſm as
Chriſt askt concerning <hi>John? What went ye forth to

Chriſt Increaſe. I will not allow of <hi>J. Faldo's</hi>
word <hi>proper</hi> at this time, though allowable enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>School-men,</hi> becauſe the Philoſophical Senſe of
it is not known to the Vulgar; The word <hi>proper</hi> now
bearing a different Signification; and in the after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41053:135"/>
uſage of the word, Chriſt's <hi>Baptiſm of the Holy
Ghoſt is the only proper Baptiſm,</hi> and that of <hi>Water but
ſhadowy and figurative.</hi> I will give him a like Caſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his uſe of the word <hi>proper,</hi> and leave it with my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what to call this part of his <hi>Reply.</hi> There was but
<hi>one proper Paſcal Lamb,</hi> and that was a Beaſt with four
Legs: Alſo, there was but <hi>one proper Circumciſion,</hi>
and that was the Circumciſion of the Fleſh; therefore
are they Evangelical, or to continue? But doth not
he know that they are notwithſtanding abrogated by
<hi>that Lamb and Circumciſion,</hi> which according to his
Language, are not proper but metaphorically ſo?
Inſomuch that after the Apoſtle's Speech that is no
more that Lamb, nor the Circumciſion that is outward,
neither Baptiſm &amp;c. but that which is not in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but in the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 28. 29.</p>
                  <p>I more then hinted p. 138, 139. of my Anſwer at
this very thing upon his making the Baptiſm the <hi>Sign</hi>
and <hi>Thing ſignified</hi> but <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> as a true Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of that Paſſage of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm;</hi> But he is
afraid to meddle with that; for indeed never Man

as I ſuppoſe no Man pretending to be a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

Practice then we ſee (and all the reaſonable

he defends his Aſſertion, by repeating his Aſſertion.
We have great Reaſon to ſuppoſe him pincht, or elſe
we ſhould not find him ſo tame; Here a Man may
handle him without Knocks. But why did he take no
notice of the reſt of my Anſwer, and ſay ſo little to

ſome, therefore it was an Ordinance.</hi> Now what can

infers <hi>Inſtitution from the Apoſtle's Practice,</hi> and
yet ſayes, <hi>He doth not ſay that Practice is an Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
unleſs he will ſhroud himſelf under the doubtful
Signification of the word <hi>Practice,</hi> which may as well
be uſed about one thing as another; but as I meant it

                  <p>He alſo told us before, That the Reaſon why Water-Baptiſm

then reputed a Goſpel-Chriſtain-Ordinance, neither
had God omitted that in his Commiſſion, nor had the
Apoſtle ſpoak ſo ſleightly of it, as he doth, when <hi>he

that there could be no Pretence of <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Prudence

the Revelation of the Son of God in them, the <hi>one

                  <p>This Citation as rankly and partially as he hath put
down, doth not prove that we account the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
either as it was eaten by Chriſt and his Diſciples
before his Death, or by his Diſciples after his Death,
<hi>to be the Pope's Invention.</hi> How can it, ſince we know
the Pope's Date to have been ſo many hundred Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that Practice; His Citation muſt therefore be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of ſuch a <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Supper</hi> as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
Church</hi> hath preſumed to practice; and that I
put not a fairer Gloſs then his own Anſwer will allow,
obſerve theſe Words; <q>and the whoſe <hi>Practice of thoſe
things AS THEY uſe them had their Inſtitution
by the Pope, and were never SO ordained of Chriſt:</hi>
                     </q>
ſtrongly implying, that what was of Chriſt's Ordination
was not of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Invention and Inſtitution; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
That the <hi>Lord's Supper was neither a popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
nor Inſtitution;</hi> which is yet plainer from his
following VVords; <q>
                        <hi>For he did not ordain ſprinkling
Water in a Child's Face, or to make a Sign of the Croſs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41053:140"/>
in his Forehead, nor God-Fathers and God-Mothers to
undertake for it; Neither did he ordain Bread and
VVine to be SO</hi> (or after that Manner) <hi>uſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
                     </q>
So that nothing can be plainer then that his
Reflection lies againſt their Manner of practizing and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them, &amp; not againſt the Things themſelves, as at any
time practiced by Chriſt or his Diſciples &amp; Followers:
Therefore he is quite beſide the Truth, in telling the
VVorld that he doth but apply theſe VVords <hi>Pope's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
to the Name, that is, <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which the
<hi>Quakers</hi> apply to the Thing; ſince we ſo clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
betwen <hi>Baptiſm</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> (Name and
Thing) and theſe Practices and Uſages of them, which
have riſen ſince the Apoſtacy; Now it reſts with thee,
Friendly Reader, to paſs Judgment, which of us two
hath acted the <hi>Deceiver</hi> (to leave out a great many more
of his hard VVords) he that affirmed <hi>VV. Smith</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which was in Uſe
ſome time as well after Chriſt's Death and Aſcenſion as
before, <hi>the Pope's Inventions,</hi> or I that affirmed, and
from <hi>VV. Smith</hi>'s own Book have expreſly proved,
that there was no ſuch thing ſaid, as <hi>Primitively</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but only as they have been ſince abuſed by the
Apoſtate Church. For the Supper it ſelf I refer the
Reader to the ſixteenth Chapter of my Anſwer, and
ſhall only ſay at this Time, that as it was a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration,
or Remembrance of Chriſt to the Diſciples,
who were at that Day ſo weak in Faith, as <hi>Luke 24. 11.
Mary Magdalen's</hi> news about Chriſt's Reſurrection
ſeemed to them as Idle Tales; yet that the Service and
conſequently the Inſtitution of it were of, as they came
to witneſs him the Evangelical Supper of Paſſover to
their Souls, and that we therefore diſcontinue it. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:41053:140"/>
Becauſe the falſe Church hath made Market with her
imitating that primitive Practice, drawn the Minds of
People abroad from the Heavenly Bread of Life, which
is only to be received within, and hath been ſhedding ſo
much Blood about it, rendring it and Water Baptiſm
the <hi>Seal</hi> of Chriſtianity, thereby puffing up People to
believe that of themſelves which they are not; Next,
we have the Teſtimony of God's Spirit that he is
withdrawn from ſuch Obſervations that have been ſo
much inſiſted on and magnified in the World; Laſtly
and eminently we diſcontinue it, becauſe Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unto our Souls that very Thing, which it was moſt
truly and properly the Sign of, to wit, the Heavnely
Bread and Paſſover, which nouriſheth the Soul unto
Eternal Life. Where by the Way it muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
how perverſly he wrongs Chriſt and Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who turns this Paſſage, <hi>Do this till I come,</hi> after
this ſtrange Manner; <hi>The Lord's Supper is a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of Chriſt's Death paſt,</hi> NOT TO COME,
Rep. p. 71. wherein <hi>firſt,</hi> he makes as if there were a
Death to come; Next, Inſtead of exhorting People
to look for his Coming, until which he bid his Diſciples
practice it, he turns back their Eyes from that Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and makes the Sign wholy to have Reference to
what was paſt, and not what was <hi>to come,</hi> thereby ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to perpetuate his Abſence, and bar out his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(implyed in theſe Words, <hi>till I come</hi>) which
ends the Abſence, during which the Inſtitution laſteth;
For the plain Engliſh of it framed into an Argument
is this: <hi>The Supper is to remember Chriſt's Death that
is paſt, but that will be alwayes paſt, therefore it ought
to be alwayes ſo remembred.</hi> The like may be ſaid upon
the Word <hi>Remembrance,</hi> for if it ought to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41053:141"/>
becauſe of remembring Chriſt's Death, then <hi>forever,</hi>
becauſe his Death ought <hi>never</hi> to be forgotten. Thus
it perverts the Text, in that it makes not the outward
Supper to ceaſe upon his Coming, as <hi>John</hi> 14. 23.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. (which is the Evangelical Supper) till
whoſe Coming Chriſt bid his Diſciples do it: But to
continue upon the Score of remembring Chriſt's Death
only (which as I ſaid before, ought never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
is conſequently to continue it upon Inſtitution
forever.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only leave two things with my Reader, and
ſo proceed to the next Chapter; <hi>firſt,</hi> That from our
diſcontinuing the Practice of theſe outward and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Obſervances, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> concludes, <hi>our abſolute and
general Denyal of them. 2ly,</hi> Becauſe ſome of our
Friends have denyed, rejected and termed Popiſh the
long Abuſe of theſe Things, he makes no Difficulty
of charging us in ſo many Words with calling Water-Baptiſm
and the Lord's Supper, as laid down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and primitively practiſed, <hi>Popiſh Inventions,</hi> &amp;c.
God if he pleaſe make this Man ſenſible of his notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>His Charge was, <hi>that we denyed the Tranſactions of

quoted by our Adverſary in his firſt Book, p. 58. and
that is Dr.<hi>Stilling fleet</hi> in a Diſcourſe called his ſix Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<q>If they did believe Chriſt came into the World
to reform it, that the Wrath of God is now revealed
from Heaven againſt all Unrighteouſneſs, that his
Love which is ſhown to the World is to deliver them
from the Hand of their Enemies, that they might ſerve
him in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs all the Dayes of
their Lives, <hi>they could never imagine that Salvation is
intailed by the Goſpel on a mighty Confidence or vehement
Perſwaſion of what Chriſt hath done for them,</hi>
                     </q> p. 160.
Thus teacheth <hi>D. Patrick, D. Tillatſon, D. Cradock,
W. Shirlock</hi> and others called <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the general <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts</hi>) how this

                  </p>
                  <p>But firſt, let is be remembred, that he <hi>cited no Book,</hi>
a Fault I found with him before, and deſired him, juſt
where he leaves off, that the next time he would let
us know what was the Book that afforded that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
which he hath not done; next, That he dares
affirm we intended our own Righteouſneſs to be that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41053:144"/>
which gives us Acceptance with God; whereas in ſo
many words I ſaid, that the Clean and Righteous Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which gives the Soul Admittance into God's
holy Courts, muſt actually be received from Chriſt,
<hi>the Lord her Righteouſneſs,</hi> which four words, with
a great many more, he diſingenuouſly skipt. For thoſe
words of his, <hi>ſubjected in Man,</hi> I know not what
he means by them, unleſs it be a Righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Power and Ability of Man to bring forth;
(for I know no other Righteouſneſs that can be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in Men) and that this was not my Meaning
(notwithſtanding his obtruſive Confidence) my own
words plainly evidence. He might as properly ſay,
that a Child's <hi>being waſhed clean by its Father, is its own
Cleanneſs, or that it made it ſelf clean;</hi> or, becauſe a
poor Man in Rags intreats ſome better Rayment at
the Charity of a great Man, and that he would pleaſe
to take him into the Capacity of a menial Servant;
<hi>therefore that Livery or Apparel beſtowed upon him, by
which he is denoted, and hath the Acceſs proper to one of his
Family, was of his own proper Coſt or Working; and
not the Gift of his Lord and Maſter.</hi> If this be
Abſurd, <hi>John Faldo</hi>'s Conſequence cannot be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, The Everlaſting Righteouſneſs which Chriſt
brings into his People, by which he fits
them for his Father's Communion,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> is not
the leſs <hi>of him,</hi> nor the more of or from us, becauſe

                  <p>If there were others more to his purpoſe then this,
he is to blame to conceal them; but believe him

What, Reader, can be clearer, firſt, then his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
of our Dependance upon Good Works for Life
and Salvation? Next, What plainer, then that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
Action, and conſequently Works, as in the
Creature, from ſo much as pleaſing God; unleſs
God vouchſafe to breath the Breath of his own Life,
and thereby impower him to bring forth Fruits of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs?
Laſtly, That the Reaſon of Man's Acceptance
is not his own Works or Actions, but his being found
acting and working in the Living Faith, which is the
Gift of God, by and through which Acceſs to, and holy
Fellowſhip with God are enjoyed by his Children—And
thus much <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s following words tell us;
<q>and ſo Life and Salvation is freely given us from God,
and by his Grace we are ſaved through the Faith which
we have in him, and that puts us upon Motion and
Action to do his Will in all things, <hi>and yet not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon what we do for Life</hi>—But do all things
which he commands us from the Motion (or firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  <p>Now, Reader, this conſidered, give us thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s daring Proof; Doth it not to a

for Juſtification by their own Works?</hi> What ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
muſt he have, that dares look the World in the
Face, and obtrude ſuch <hi>arrant Vntruths</hi> upon it?
Doth this Scandalous Perverſion become a Man who

Miſ-render or Miſ-apply our Writings?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude; He ſeems to write at all Adventures,

ſupplying his VVeakneſs with Confidence, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Noiſe of his own Forgeries by his vehement
Clamours againſt ſuch imaginary ones as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for me, to go under my Name, which is his

be ſtopt in this Unconſcionable Courſe, and come to
find true Repentance, that Eternal Anguiſh do not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably
over-take him, as the Juſt Recompence

                  <p>His third Citation was out of <hi>I. Penington;</hi> 
                     <q>Can
outward Blood cleanſe the Conſcience? Can outward
Water waſh the Soul clean? </q>His Comment upon it is
this, <hi>A plain Denyal of the Efficacy of the Blood of

of Sin, by its Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God.</hi> To
which I anſwered, <q>Doth <hi>I. P.</hi> deny or any way
meddle with the outward Blood concerning the
Guilt of Sin paſt, how far it had an Influence <hi>into</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
taking Juſtification in that Senſe. But
doth not <hi>I. P.</hi> treat of the outward Blood with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to Purgation and Sanctification of the Soul from
the preſent (Nature) Acts and Habits of Sin that
lodges therein? Is there no Difference betwixt being
pardon'd Sin paſt, <hi>and the Ground of it,</hi> and being
renewed and regenerated in Mind and Spirit, <hi>and the
Ground of that Converſion?</hi>
                     </q> His Reply to this, though

the Blood of Chriſt, which he calls outward, to have an
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41053:146"/>
influence into Sanctification, he commits a foul Error; for
cleanſing the Conſcience by Sanctification is the Effect of
the Blood of Chriſt, as well as the other. The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
or Convenant is by Chriſt ſaid to be the Cup of
the New Teſtament in my Blood, wherein all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
and Mercies of the New Covenant are aſſerted,
of which, I think, Cleanſing by Sanctification is none of
the leaſt.</p>

                  <p>If <hi>by the Promiſe of Sanctification to be aſſerted in the
Blood of Chriſt,</hi> he underſtands that both the Promiſe
of Sanctification, and all other Promiſes relating to the
Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, <hi>were aſſerted, ratified and
ſealed to them that believe, in and by the Blood of Chriſt,</hi>
I ſhall heartily and cheerfully ſubmit; But if he mean
that the Blood of Chriſt, ſhed ſo many Hundred Years
ago by the Hands of Ungodly Men, is the inherent
real Purger of the Conſcience from Dead Works, I
muſt deny what he ſayes; <hi>for the Scripture attributes
Sanctification to the Eternal Spirit;</hi> It is one Article of
the common Creed of the called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> viz. the
<hi>Lavour of Regeneration, which is by the Spirit.</hi> But
what is all this to <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s defending himſelf from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
<hi>I. Penington</hi>'s Words? to wit, that by asking,
<q>Can Outward Blood Cleanſe? Can Outward Water
waſh the Soul?</q> He would make him to deny Chriſt's
ſacrificing of himſelf upon the Croſs to have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
towards the Remitting of the Guilt of Sin paſt,
which is quite another thing? as this Argument mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts,
which naturally expreſſeth <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s wreſting
of <hi>I. P</hi>'s words?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:41053:147"/>
He that denyes Outward Blood can cleanſe the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
denyes that Outward Blood may be a Sacrifice
whereby to declare the Remiſſion of the Guilt of Sin paſt,
<hi>which is ſo abſolutely and obviouſly falſe,</hi> that it may be
ſeen of every mean Capacity; Yet hitherto <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s
Reaſoning runs. Once again before we leave him,
thus.</p>
                  <p>He that is pardoned the Guilt of Sin that is paſt by
the Blood of Chriſt as a Sacrifice declaring Remiſſion to
all that believe, is by the ſame Blood waſhed, cleanſed,
renewed and regenerated in his inward Man from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature, Power and In-dwelling of Sin; <hi>which is
as untrue as the other; yet both theſe Arguments
follow upon</hi> J. F'<hi>s miſ-rendering of</hi> I. Penington'<hi>s
words; But his Credit in this Particular is not at all
blemiſht by his Comment upon</hi> I. P'<hi>s words, if we

                  <p>There is no Difficulty, Friendly Reader, in unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his pretended <hi>Myſtery,</hi> if the Queſtion unto which
the Anſwer was made be conſidered, which was this,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41053:147"/>
                     <hi>What is your Faith concerning Chriſt</hi> IN YOU <hi>as a
Redeemer?</hi> which relates not to the Blood of Chriſt
ſhed on the Croſs of Wood; wherefore to make the
Anſwer deny Remiſſion of Sins to be declared by
Chriſt's ſacrificing of his Body upon the Croſs (which
was no part of the Queſtion to be anſwered) is like all
the reſt of his Injuſtice towards us; If the Anſwer had
rejected that Sacrifice, we ſhould have condemned it,
as much as he hath abuſed it; But unleſs he denyes
that Chriſt offers himſelf in his Children in the Nature
of a Mediating Sacrifice, <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s words are ſo far
from Denying the Blood of Chriſt ſhed upon the
Croſs of Wood, that he muſt allow them to be ſound
in themſelves; <hi>for Chriſt is a Mediator and an Attoner
in the Conſciences of his People,</hi> at what time they ſhall
fall under any Miſcarriage, if they unfeignedly Repent,
according to 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. as allowably as that he
prayes in his People, as their Head,<note place="margin">A. Sadeel Oper. pag. 37.</note>
which <hi>A. Sadeel</hi> ſaith out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
and <hi>D. Everad,</hi> as anon. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole, this is as ſtrong and clear a Proof, as
others that he hath hither to brought; for as they, ſo
this (in Queſtion and Anſwer) wholely concerns
what Chriſt is to Man <hi>in Man</hi> (which was no part of
the Queſtion) and not what he was to any in his Viſible
Appearance, which was the only Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Particular, I muſt again declare,
That we are led by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt with
Holy Reverence to confeſs unto the <hi>Blood of Chriſt ſhed
at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as that by which a Propitiation was held
forth to the Remiſſion of the Sins that were paſt through
the Forbearance of God unto all that believed:</hi> And we
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41053:148"/>
do embrace it as ſuch; and do firmly believe, that
thereby God declared his great Love unto the World;
for by it is the Conſciouſneſs of Sin declared to be taken
away, or Remiſſion ſealed to all that have known <hi>true
Repentance, and Faith in his Appearance.</hi> But becauſe
of the Condition, I mean <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do we exhort all to <hi>turn their Minds to the Light
and Spirit of Chriſt within, that by ſeeing their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and being by the ſame brought both into true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
and holy Confidence in God's Mercy, they may
come to receive the Benefit thereof;</hi> for without that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Condition, it will be impoſſible to obtain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Sins, though it be ſo generally promulgated
thereby.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; As in my Anſwer at large, ſo here, in ſhort;
I ſay; Juſtification may be taken in a two-fold Senſe;
Compleatly, and Incompleatly: or rather thus, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Juſtification hath two parts; the firſt is, <hi>not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
paſt Sins, or accounting a true Penitant, as
Righteous</hi> (or clear from the Guilt of paſt Sin) <hi>as if
he had never Sinned, through the Remiſſion which God
declared and ſealed up to all ſuch in the Blood of his Son;</hi>
and thus far Righteouſneſs as imputed goes, and is the
firſt part or Juſtification begun. The compleat or
laſt part of compleat Juſtification, <hi>is the Cleanſing of
the Conſcience, and Regenerating the Mind from the
Nature, Power and In-dwelling of Sin by the effectual
working of the Heavenly Power of Chriſt, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Heart, and eſtabliſhing his Everlaſting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs

counted for Righteouſneſs; <hi>that is,</hi> God acquitted upon
Repentance, and Faith in his Promiſe, ſuch as have lived
in a Courſe of Vngodlineſs. <hi>For no preſent Work,
how good ſoever, can juſtifie any Man from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
which is due for the Guilt of Sin that is paſt.
So that juſtifying the Ungodly in this place is</hi> pardoning
<hi>the Ungodly; and being ſo pardoned, upon Faith in
the Promiſe of God,</hi> is accounted for Righteouſneſs, or
as if the Perſon pardoned had never ſinned: <hi>and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the 7th and 8th verſes,</hi> Bleſſed are they
whoſe Sins are forgiven, and whoſe Iniquities are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                  <p>Again, Chap. 5. 6. <hi>For when we were yet wit hout
Strength, Chriſt in due time dyed for the Vngodly;</hi> and
verſe 8. But <hi>God commended his Love towards us, in
that while we were yet Sinners Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> That
is, Chriſt laid down his Life to reclaim Sinners, and to
declare the Righteouſneſs of God for the Forgiveneſs
of the Sin that is paſt, to all Ungodly and Sinful Men,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41053:149"/>
that turn from the Evil of their Wayes by unfeigned
Repentance; it was done in and by Chriſt for all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Men, but not to the Benefit of any without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Not that people ſhould go on in Sin, but
by ſo recommending of his Love, and ſealing ſuch Glad-Tidings
with his own Blood, to allure and engage
them from their preſent Courſe of Sin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>He firſt loved us, men muſt not therefore continue in Sin,
that Grace (<hi>that is Forgiveneſs</hi>) may abound; <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
Rom.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The laſt conſiderable Place is in the ſecond Epiſtle to
the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 21. For he hath made him
Sin for us, who knew no Sin; <hi>That is,</hi> He was made a
Sacrifice for the remitting or paſſing over of the Sin that
was paſt; for ſuch as repent and believe, that they might
be made the Righteouſneſs of God, or rather accounted Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in the Sight of God, as if they had never committed
Sin by not imputing or forgiving the Sin that was paſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Sence the two fore-going Verſes confirm, to wit,</hi>
that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf,
not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them the Word of of Reconciliation. Now
then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did
beſeeeh you through us, We pray you in Chriſt's Stead, that

                     <hi>The Scriptures that belong to the ſecond Part of this

ſuch as theſe:</hi> Keep thee far from a falſe Matter, &amp; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

<hi>WORKETH RIGHTEOUSNESS</hi> and <hi>SPEAKETH
THE TRUTH IN HIS HEART, Pſalm.</hi> 15. 1, 2.
When a Righteous man turns away from his Righteouſneſs,
for his Iniquity that he has done, ſhall he dye; <hi>Again,</hi> when
the wicked Man turneth away from his Wickedneſs, and
doth that which is Lawful or Right, he ſhall ſave his Soul,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 26, 27. Not every one that ſayeth unto me
Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,

cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3, 5. If
ye keep my Commandment, ye ſhall abide in my Love,

but the Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13.
If ye live after the Fleſh ye ſhall dye; but if ye through
the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Body ye ſhall live,
for as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. 13, 14. That the Offering of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

                  <p>In all theſe weighty Paſſages there is nothing more

Repentance, which is the beginning of the Work of
Sanctfication, opens the Way <hi>for the Remiſſion of Sins

ſo is Regeneration or Sanctification throughout, in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

                     <p>We may be bold to ſay after Chriſt, That <hi>Fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth
nothing.</hi> If you only know Chriſt's Dying
and Riſing <hi>without you,</hi> it will profit you nothing,
<hi>except</hi> you have him Dying and Riſing <hi>within you.
Error in this is the Root of the Dead Faith, whereof
the World is full—Paul</hi> doth not ſay, that the
Hearing that Chriſt dyed for the Sins of Men, doth
make them free; No, there was the <hi>Spirit of Life in
Chriſt Jeſus</hi>—Here is that which puts a Difference,
<hi>when the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt brings the Covenant to
the Heart of a poor Creature, when the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Sonſhip revealing us God as our Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
God in Vnion with us, our Righteouſneſs and
our Strength,</hi> he doth indeed ſeal us to the Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41053:152"/>
He ſets apart Chriſt's Sheep, this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth

That we don't deny there was ſuch a Man as Jeſus, the

                  <p>He ſhould have given us the Book and Page, where
<hi>G. F.</hi> hath ſo expreſſed himſelf; however, we deny
not that Doctrine; <hi>for God doth dwell and walk in his
Children, who are called his Temples and Tabernacles in
Holy Scripture,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. Rev. 21. 3. But we
muſt forever reject <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s ignorant or worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;
That becauſe we own, that God dwells in
his Children, therefore <hi>he dwelt no more in that Body
of Fleſh he prepared to manifeſt himſelf by then he doth
in his People;</hi> Or, that our aſſerting, that God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and dwelt in that Holy Body eminently prepared by
him, is to be underſtood in no larger Senſe, then that
in which we underſtand him to dwell in his Children.
I might as well argue againſt the Scripture as <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
doth againſt us; Chriſt was full of Grace and Truth;
therefore when he fills his Children with Grace and
Truth, <hi>they have as much Grace and Truth in them as
their Lord and Maſter.</hi> Or thus, God was in Chriſt
and God was in <hi>Paul;</hi> therefore <hi>he was as much in</hi> Paul
<hi>as he was in Chriſt.</hi> It is after this Rate, Reader, our
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41053:154"/>
Adverſary eſſayes to confute us, as if we made no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
between the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> and the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> the
<hi>Treaſury</hi> and the <hi>Gift;</hi> He was full of Grace and

                  <p>The next Thing I obſerved from what he gave as our

ſo kind? the Man knew it pincht him, and ſeem'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to conceal it. It was this: <q>In the midſt of his
ſecond Proof, he inſerts theſe two Words VERY
RIGHT, as his Aſſent to that Part of it, which to
me ſeems as inconſiſtent with his Purpoſe as may be,
to wit, <hi>that which Chriſt took upon htm was our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
even the <hi>Fleſh and Blood of our Nature;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid I, <hi>John Faldo</hi> as well as we acknowledgeth,
That the <hi>Garment</hi> is not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſs there be no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

<hi>Chriſt</hi> was but the <hi>Garment</hi> of that divine Being that
dwells therein; which were unſcriptural and very
carnal;</q> and I ſtill ſay, That Chriſt's <hi>Garment</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſtitute him Chriſt. And that, as he darkly calls
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41053:154"/>
it the (intire) Chriſt (as I ſhall make appear) ſo hath
he in this Conceſſion contradicted himſelf, and utterly
given away the Cauſe. But he is of another Mind as

                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls his and the Saints Bodies their

                  <p>A meer Rattle for Children. Did the Body God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for his Son to do his Will in, help to conſtitute him
Chriſt, as much as the Apoſtles Body did help to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
him <hi>Paul?</hi> If it did, why may we not as well ſay
that <hi>Paul</hi> was among the Fathers in the Wilderneſs ſo
many hundred Years before he was born, as the ſame
Apoſtle doth aſſert, <hi>Chriſt by Name to have been the
ſpiritual Rock of which the Fathers drank in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
1 Cor. 10. 4. for if the Body conſtitute him Chriſt,
as ſayes <hi>J. F.</hi> then he could no more be Chriſt before
he had that Body, then <hi>Paul</hi> could be <hi>Paul</hi> before he
had his Body; and conſequently, There is no more
Abſurdity in affirming, That <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Paul</hi> ſo many
hundred Years before he was born, then that Chriſt was
Chriſt ſo many hundred Years before he was born.</p>
                  <p>Again, If <hi>Paul</hi>'s Body were but a Cloathing, how
much more remote doth <hi>J. F</hi>'s Compariſon make
Chriſt's Body to be from his Divinity? ſince <hi>Paul</hi> did not
preexiſt, Chriſt did; but he that took that Body, and
that Body that was taken, were not of equal Date;
for the Body was taken in the Fulneſs of Time; but he
that took it, and manifeſted himſelf by it, was from
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41053:155"/>
Everlaſting. In ſhort, Chriſt qualified that Body for
his Service, but that Body did not conſtitute Chriſt;
He is inviſible, and ever was ſo to the ungodly World;
(that was not his Body) as honeſt <hi>J. Bradford</hi> told
<hi>Arch-Deacon Harpsfield.</hi> B. Mart. 3. Vol. p. 293. and
ſo much the Word <gap reason="foreign">

was not outward after the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony, but by the

                  <p>Laſtly, I will leave it with my Reader to conſider
what better terms then <hi>Earthly and Periſhing. J. F</hi>'s
Compariſon implyeth to Chriſt's Body; for ſuch was
the Apoſtles and the Bodies of thoſe Saints he writ to.
But he will by no means have himſelf concerned with a
great Part of my following Diſcourſe, which was, he
thinks, in Oppoſition to no Body; becauſe I argued
that the meer Body of Chriſt could not be the <hi>intire
Chriſt</hi> (though he makes our Denyal of it to be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
of the true Chriſt) producing a Paſſage out
his Book to my Purpoſe in Contradiction to himſelf,
viz. p. 72. <hi>The Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be Chriſt, ſeparated from his Mans Soul, or that
to be Chriſt ſeparated from his Divne and Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>

arguing it was impoſſible for him to prove our Denyal
of the true Chriſt, becauſe. we aſſerted Chriſt to have

that by the Chriſt of God he underſtands

up (the Body of) Jeſus from the Dead, which ye

                  <p>I appeal to my Reader's Underſtanding and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
if <hi>J. Faldo</hi> doth not in this Sentence make the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41053:157"/>
                     <hi>meer Body</hi> of Chriſt to be the Chriſt of God; for one
Reaſon why he denyes my Interpretation, is my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>meer Body</hi> only to have dyed, which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>intire Chriſt</hi> of God, it was not <hi>He,</hi> but his
<hi>Body</hi> only that dyed. So that either <hi>J. Faldo</hi> holds the
<hi>meer Body to be the Chriſt,</hi> or elſe, <hi>that ſomething more
dyed then the meer Body:</hi> But becauſe he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Deity</hi> could not dye, nor that the <hi>Soul did dye,</hi>
it muſt follow that the <hi>Body</hi> only dyed; And ſince he
will ſtrictly have it, that the Chriſt of God dyed, <hi>the
meer Body muſt be the Chriſt of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſecond Exception is very trivial, and what in it
can be thought to deſerve an Anſwer, is included in
what was ſaid before; for <hi>whom</hi> might be attributed to
the Body, as it repreſented the whole or intire Chriſt,
that is Metonymically ſpoaken, the <hi>Thing containing,</hi> for
the <hi>Thing contained,</hi> which is very frequent in Scripture;
for many times that is <hi>aſcribed to the Body of Jeſus, which
belongs to the whole Chriſt.</hi> This, with abundance more
of pertinent Anſwer he takes no more notice of, then
if it had never been written. But a little to give J. F.
his Humor, and to ſee if the Upſhot riſes higher then
<hi>which.</hi> What doth he underſtand by the Perſon ſlain?
(according to J. F's own diſtinctions) Was it the
Godhead? That he denyes, firſt Book, part 2. p. 73.
Was it the Man's Soul? No, Reply, p. 78. <hi>Muſt
it not be the Body then?</hi> And if ſo? What Corrupting
of Scripture is it to ſay, <hi>which</hi> ye ſlew, inſtead of <hi>whom</hi>

Upon my recollecting the whole of this Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and concluding thus, Since the Divinity <hi>could
not dye,</hi> and the Man's Soul <hi>was not Mortal,</hi> much
leſs could be hanged on a Tree, or put into a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
it follows, <hi>That it was the viſible Body only that
dyed, &amp;c.</hi> and that it is therefore the <hi>intire Lord and
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>J. F</hi>'s as well as Blaſphemous

                  <p>But if it follows upon my Senſe, it follows upon the

there is no ſuch ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

know it is a common Phraſe, but ſynecdochically
ſpoken, where that is aſcribed to the whole Man, which
only belongeth to the Mortal part of Man. This brings
the Buſineſs no nearer then it was before; for if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
any thing, <hi>the Compariſon makes the Death of

                  <p>I had thought that the Soul being Vnited with the
Body till Death, where-ever the Body was diſpoſed, the
Soul was alſo; and therefore the Body ſo long as it liveth,
hanging on a Tree, the Soul hangs there too; alſo many
a poor Wretch can tell him at the Torment of Execution,
that his Doctrine is Falſe; for were but their Souls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from their Bodies, they would feel no Pain, nor
cry out of their Torment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rejoynder.</speaker>
                  <p>A very Shuffie, and nothing to the Purpoſe. The
Soul is in the Body ſo long as the Body is alive upon
the Tree, and yet it ſelf not ſtrictly hanged on the
Tree; for if it were, then would it be as impoſſible
for the Soul as Body to free it ſelf, whilſt the Soul
by his own Allowance is incomparable and impoſſible,
becauſe immaterial; whereas <hi>Nales, Ropes,</hi> or any other
Inſtruments of Cruelty, can only faſten upon materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things; for if the Soul could be properly hanged,
ſhe could as well be burnt, and laid into a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.
A Man might as well ſay, if <hi>J. Faldo</hi> were
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41053:158"/>
hanged on a Tree, his Watch in his Pocket would
be hanged; or if he were put in the Stocks, his
Underſtanding would be in the Stocks. Nor hath
any poor Wretch reaſon to complain of my Doctrine
at their Executions; for I never denyed, that Pain was
a Sign of the Soul's not being ſeparated, ſince it is an
undeniable Reaſon, why it is not ſeparated; however,
it is not the Soul, but the Body (through that ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the Soul, while unſeparated, continues in it)
which feels that Pain.</p>
                  <p>But I could tell <hi>J. Faldo</hi> of many Bleſſed Martyrs,
that in the midſt of Flames, were carryed above the
Senſe of Pain; not becauſe their Souls were not in
their Bodies at the Stake, but from the exceeding Joy
of the Holy Spirit, which by the way may as well be
ſaid to be tyed to the Stake, as the Soul, becauſe in
the Soul; for that is the Concluſion of J. F's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
The Soul is in the Body, therefore the Soul is
as well tyed as the Body; the Holy Spirit and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
are in the Soul, therefore tyed as well to the Stake
as either Body or Soul.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Souls may be hanged upon Trees, as Souls
in Scripture are ſaid to dye, or be ſlain, an <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Phraſe; not that Souls really did dye or were ſlain, but
that Man is called many times by his nobler Part.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with a few Reaſons
for the Hope that is in us, concerning the Subject
Matter of this Chapter, and two or Three Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in Confirmation of them, which I offer with all
Tenderneſs of Conſcience unto my ſerious Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:41053:159"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Opinion of our Adverſary's renders
Chriſt not to have been the Saviour of the World
from <hi>Abel</hi>'s Day, contrary to Scripture, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to believe, <hi>That there was never another Name
or Power by which Men could be ſaved, then the Name
and</hi> Power <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It makes Chriſt's Words either an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
or a Contradiction, when he ſaid unto the
<hi>Jews, Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am;</hi> ſince it makes him
that was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and him that ſaid ſo, not the
ſame Perſon or Being rather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Anointed,</hi> hath a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his being King, Prieſt and Prophet, which
are both of a more Spiritual Nature and Dignity, then
the Fleſh Chriſt took of the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for
he was made the high Prieſt of the ſecond Covenant,
was without beginning of Dayes or End of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe Chriſt himſelf magnifieth the
<hi>Spirit above the Fleſh;</hi> They look not farther then his
Body, or Fleſh as it was viſible to the World, and he
appointed them to look farther, yea, to his Fleſh and
Blood ſpiritually, which is Meat indeed, and Drink
indeed, being that Living Bread which came down
from Heaven, that who eats thereof ſhall live fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 48, to 58, &amp; 63. And thoſe that ſee not
through and beyond that viſible Body of Fleſh, which
was the Vail which the eternal Word took to traſact
and repreſent as in a common Perſon, that which every
Child of God ought meaſurably to witneſs in his own
particular, unto the beholding and partaking of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Widom, Power and Righteouſneſs that dwelt
therein which are Meat indeed and Drink indeed unto
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41053:159"/>
every hungry and thirſty Soul, they are not yet come
to the chief <hi>Corner-Stone that is Elect and Pretious,</hi>
but are carnal, not knowing the Scriptures nor the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus lay'd far more Weight upon the
Coming of the Comforter, or <hi>himſelf,</hi> in his ſecond
and ſpiritual Appearance in them, among whom he bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
converſed, then upon the Continuance of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Preſence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. intimating that he intended a
more ſpiritual Communion with them, <hi>they in him and he
in them, even as he was in his Father &amp; his Father in him,</hi>
chap. 17, 21, 23. a Fellowſhip beyond what they had
already known, how could it otherwiſe have been <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi>
as the Text expreſſeth it, if the Change from
his viſible to inviſible Preſence, had not been both more
glorious and advantageous: His Diſciples believed him
for the Words he ſpoak, Chap. 16. 30. But ver. 31. 32.
Jeſus anſwerd them, <hi>Do you now believe? Behold, the
Hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye ſhall be ſcattered
every Man to his OWN;</hi> as much as if he had ſaid,
You ſhall then know me and believe in me upon a more
clear and certain Ground, when you ſhall have received
thus of my Fulneſs, <hi>and Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16.
and be ſcattered to it, which is hard to be done while I
ſtay in this Capacity among you; therefore it is <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
that I go away, as to my bodily Preſence, <hi>Joh.</hi>
16. 7. (on which you have ſuch great Dependence) but I
<hi>(Chriſt)</hi> will not leave you comfortleſs, <hi>I will come a
Comforter unto you,</hi> Chap. 14. 3, 18, 19, 20. <hi>For lo I
am with you alwayes even to the End of the World,</hi> Mat.
28. 20. this is the Chriſt of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſired not, thence
forth to know Chriſt after the Fleſh, but ſpiritually as
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41053:160"/>
he was the Son of God revealed in himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. and as the Apoſtle counted all other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Droſs &amp; Dung to that of the Glory of God in the
face of Jeſus Chriſt reveal'd in him; ſo was he not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſhould reſt in a fleſhly Knowledge
of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>but travelled in Birth with them</hi> (like a
faithful Witneſs of the inward Work of God) <hi>a ſecond
time until Chriſt was formed in them,</hi> Gal. 4. 19. who
doubtleſs was the true Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Becauſe that Fleſh of Chriſt is called a
<hi>Vail,</hi> but he himſelf is <hi>within</hi> the Vail, which is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Holyeſt, <hi>whereinto</hi> Chriſt Jeſus our High Prieſt
hath <hi>entered,</hi> Hebr. 10. 20, 21. And as he deſcended
into, and paſt through a ſuffering State in his fleſhly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note>
and returned into that State of
Immortality and Eternal Life and Glory
from whence he humbled himſelf, which was and is the
Holy of Holieſt (then obſcur'd or hid by his fleſh or body
the Vail) while in the World) ſo muſt all know a Death
to their Fleſhly Wayes and Religions, yea their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt himſelf after the Fleſh, or they ſtick
in the Vail, and never enter into the Holy of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
nor come to know him in any Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as their High and Holy Prieſt that abides
therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Becauſe that Chriſt lives and dwells in the
Hearts of his Children, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. chap. 15. 5.
chap. 17. 21. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 27. which cannot be ſaid of the
Outward Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I cannot by any means believe that the
meer viſible Fleſh and Body conſtitutes Chriſt; though
I ſhall confeſs, that reſpecting the Adminiſtration, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41053:160"/>
the Service of that Holy Body (fitted and quallified of
God as an Inſtrument to uſher, introduce and bring it
forth into the World) it may very well have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it the Name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being ſo nearly related;
But rather that Divine Nature, Wiſdom, Power,
Righteouſneſs, Grace and Truth, of which he is the
Fulneſs (whoſe tranſcending Glory was vailed by that
Body of Fleſh he wore, and was only let forth in that
Day as any were capable of beholding and receiving it)
which dwelt therein. And thoſe who at this Day do
ſeed upon the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Bodily Appearance (yet
honourable in its place) &amp; know not a breaking through
the Vail, by witneſſing a Meaſure of the ſame Divine
Wiſdom, Power, Righteouſneſs, Grace &amp; Truth reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and born forth in themſelves, they are but carnal and
fleſhly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being unacquainted with the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Chriſt of God in themſelves, which is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the Myſtery of Chriſt, God manifeſted in the
Fleſh, and Chriſt abiding the Hope of Glory in the
Souls of his People.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction, friendly Reader, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
<hi>Body,</hi> is very unpleaſant to me; but I am thruſt into
it by the loud Clamours of our Adverſary againſt us,
&amp; as too ſhort he reſts our words ſo as to rebuke his fond
Abſurdities, I hope ſufficiently detected, and which was
more in my Eye, and indeed lay hardeſt upon my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to oppoſe and defeat his Carnal Objections againſt
the Glorious Chriſt of God; for, by his vehement
Out-cries at us, as Perſons denying the Chriſt of God,
becauſe we rather chuſe to call that Body that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
of God, the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi>
to beat People off at once from hearkening after our
Doctrine of the Spiritual Second Coming of Chriſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41053:161"/>
into the Souls of Men; for if his Doctrine be true,
Chriſt doth not really dwell in his Children; thereby
depriving the Children of Men from the moſt Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Enjoyment and Priviledge God hath laid up for
them that fear him: For I am bold to affirm, and
that in the Name of the only True and Wiſe God,
<hi>The True Church is become Chriſt's Body, and he</hi> (the
Divine Wiſdom, Power and Righteouſneſs) <hi>lives,
reigns and puts forth himſelf in and by her; and that all
thoſe who come not thus to experience the Chriſt of God to
dwell in them, their King Prophet and High Prieſt</hi> (who
is without Beginning of Dayes and End of Life) <hi>they
are ignorant of God's Chriſt, do ſtick in the Vail, and
know not any Entrance into the Holy of Holies, where
the Divine Vnction from the High Prieſt is received,
and the Bleſſed, Holy, Spiritual Fellowſhip of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
is witneſſed;</hi> for which Glorious Diſpenſation we
contend through all Difficulties, making it our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to promote it in the World; and though it be
now but as a Cloud of a Span long, yet it ſhall ſpread
and cover the Heavens, from whence the Inhabitants of
the Earth ſhall receive Refreſhment, being bedewed
and covered with the Vertue and Righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for want of which the World is as a Wilderneſs,
being over run with all manner of Impiety under a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Shew of Religion, making up that Whore of
<hi>Babylon</hi> and Mother of Harlots, and City filled with
all ſorts of Abomination, againſt which the Wrath of
God is now, and will yet be more and more revealed.
Oh! Compaſſion to the Souls of Men, our Brethren
in the Fleſh, opens our Mouthes with frequent Cryes,
that they would come out of her, leſt they be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of her Plagues; <hi>for, knowing the Terrors of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41053:161"/>
Lord, we therefore perſwade them to a diligent ſearch
after the one Thing neceſſary, which ſhall never be taken
from them,</hi> I mean, <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they are his by the Waſhing of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
For with great Sorrow I write it, God he knows;
Unſpeakable and Irreparable is the Loſs Multitudes
have ſuſtained by ſuch Carnal Conceits, as their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
through Blindneſs have begot a Belief in them
of, and a Zeal for, as ſufficient to Salvation, to the
ſuſpecting and open decrying under the hateful Names
of <hi>Error, Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> the very Soul or
Subſtance of True <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which only
brings to the Inheritance of it.</p>
                  <p>For us, our Appeal is to God, and that Impartial
Generation he is now bringing forth, who will have
an Ear to hear, and a Palate to ſavour and taſte the
Truth of this Ancient Myſtery, <hi>Chriſt in them the
Hope of Glory,</hi> at what time theſe teſtimonies ſhall
be of value, however diſ-regarded by the falſe <hi>Jew</hi> and
Carnal <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of the preſent Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will end my part herein with our moſt ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in the Holy Fear of God,</hi> That we believe in no
other Lord Jeſus Chriſt then he who appeared to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of old at ſundry Times and in divers Manners,
and in the Fulneſs of Time took Fleſh of the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and Stock of <hi>David,</hi> became <hi>Immanuel, God
manifeſt in Fleſh,</hi> through which he converſed in the
World, preached his Everlaſting Goſpel, and by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power gathered faithful Witneſſes; and when his
Hour was come, was taken of cruel Men, his Body <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ſlain,</hi> which Life he gave to proclaim, upon Faith
and Repentance, a general Ranſom to the World; the
Third Day he roſe again, and afterwards appeared
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41053:162"/>
among his Diſciples, in whoſe view he was received up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Glory, <hi>but returned again,</hi> fulfilling thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>He that is with you, ſhall be in you; I will not
leave you comfortleſs, I will come to you again, and
receive you unto my ſelf,</hi> John 14. 3, 17, 18. <hi>and</hi>
that he did come and abide at really in them, and doth
now in his Children by Meaſure, as without Meaſure
in that Body prepared to perform the Will of God in;
That He is their King, Prophet and High Prieſt, and
intercedes and mediates on their behalf, bringing in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Righteouſneſs, Peace and Aſſurance forever
into all their Hearts and Conſciences; to whom be Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Honour and Dominion, Amen.</p>

<hi>J. Faldo</hi> expreſly ſayes, p. 84, 85. <q>
                        <hi>as the Word is the
Light of Men, ſo or in that Manner is Chriſt the Light
of Men;</hi>
                     </q> nay, he calls it, <q>
                        <hi>Chriſt appearing in the Fleſh,</hi>
                     </q>
conſequently, Chriſt was before he took that Fleſh,
or appeared in that Body (not to conſtitute him or
make him Chriſt, but to tranſact, work, declare
and bring to paſs by and through it, as a peculiar
Veſſel, and prepared holy Inſtrument) therefore Chriſt
was and is that Word which was with God and is God,
and the Light of Men.</p>
                  <p>This was my Argument grounded upon his Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
What Advantage it is to our Cauſe, let it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

it was my calling his Acknowledgments a Juſtification

his Silence to my Reader, and inſert his Reply to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <hi>God manifeſted it in

                  <p>Theſe Words, <hi>Yea, and Man too,</hi> are added; but
with this woful Impertinency that they wholy contradict
his Saying, <hi>Salvation of poor Sinners was wrapt up in
Chriſt as God;</hi> for they imply a Denyal of Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
being wrapt up in Chriſt as Man; and that this
was his Meaning, take his own Words, as they ly in
his own Book, part 2. p. 85.</p>
                  <p>And this I take to be the Import of the 4th verſe (10. 1.
<hi>In him was Life and the Life was the Light of Men,</hi>
That is, the Salvation and Life Eternal of poor Sinners
was wrapt up in Chriſt as <hi>GOD,</hi> who being <hi>SO

                  <p>I ſay again and all reaſonable Men muſt acknowledge
I did not wrong his Meaning, but gave his Senſe and not
mine: To be ſure, there are no ſuch Words as theſe,

Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>His other Words about the <hi>Divinity's not excluding

<hi>That was the true Light</hi> in any other Time then
Chriſt's Coming in the Fleſh;<note place="margin">Chriſt was the Eternal Light before <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtified of him. See Book called, Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of certain lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Divines in the Year 1645 on <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. verſe 9.</note> to
which I oppoſed about a page and a
half of which he hath reported not
above four Lines, and thoſe not as
they lay. Take it Reader, briefly
thus: <q>If the Word that made all
things, which was with God and was
God, was that true Light, as ſayes
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf, p. 84. then can
it never be reſtrained to that Appearance as the
Beginning or End of it; nay the Evangeliſt is not
yet come ſo much as to mention any Thing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
in Fleſh; and if we will believe <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
the Verſe concerns the Word <hi>Creator</hi> and not <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
which he ſtints to his Coming in the Fleſh, ſee
pag. 89. But by his Interpretation THAT is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to his Appearance in the Fleſh, but to the <hi>Word,</hi>
which was with God, and was God, as p. 84. and ſo
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41053:166"/>
the <hi>Spaniſh Tranſlation</hi> hath it, <hi>That</hi> WORD <hi>was
the true Light, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that either the <hi>Word</hi> was not
before that Appearance; or if it were, being that true
Light, <hi>that true Light was before that Appearance.</hi>
Therefore Man-kind may very well be ſaid, to have
alwayes been enlightned by that Light, or that the
Word ſhould be before that Appearance, and that true
Light, which is the very Life of the Word, or Word
it ſelf, ſhould be ſtinted to that Appearance, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
as any thing well can be.</q> Now Reader comes
that part which he cited, but more regularly; <q>That
we ſhould take <hi>That was the true Light, &amp;c.</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chriſt now to be true Light that enlightens all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  <p>I did abundantly prove it in our Sence, and nothing
ſolid hath been offered to invalidate what I alledged;
but let it ſuffice that he hath granted my Charge. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
In denying Chriſt to have been <hi>either Chriſt or the true
Light before that Time,</hi> a manifeſt Contradiction to
himſelf, p. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89. of his firſt Book,
ſecond Part. <hi>Next,</hi> He therefore denyes, that Chriſt
is now the true Light, becauſe, <hi>he is not at this Day God
manifeſted in Fleſh in the ſame Manner as he was then,</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:41053:166"/>
and thus much further, that he was the true Light before
that Appearance (<hi>Socinianiſm</hi> in the abſtract) I do not
ſay ſo in Diſgrace, but becauſe he pretends to diſown it.
For his ſaying, I ſhould have undertaken to prove them
is abſurd, unleſs he had denyed them. This with me,
is matter enough to impeach my Adverſary of blackeſt
Sacriledge. I need add no more, nor no more will I add
then this, The Queſtion was not, whether we affirm
Chriſt to be that Light by his viſible and bodily Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death Reſurrection, &amp;c.
in this Day, which he was in that. But whether theſe
Words <hi>that was the true Light,</hi> did not relate to the
Life of the Word which was with God and was God
(and conſequently if he did not enlighten Men) before
he took Fleſh, in the Fleſh, and after his Reſurrection
and Aſcenſion by his Eternal Power and God-head, as
the great <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteouſneſs and <hi>ſpiritual Luminary</hi>
of the Inviſible and Intelligible World? Unto which
his Words bear no Relation, unleſs it be any to deny
the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I told him, the very next Words to thoſe
he cited, That ſhould we grant the Evangeliſt to refer
to that Appearance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. yet it would conclude no
Denyal of Chriſt's being the true Light that enlightens
every Man that cometh into the World both before and
ſince that Appearance, becauſe it was the moſt eminent
breaking forth of the divine Light; which doubtleſs
had been enough to ſatisfie any moderate or modeſt
Man, but not ſatisfying him, I muſt infer as before,
that his Diſpleasure is againſt our believing Chriſt to
have enlightned before and ſince that viſible Coming,
which if I underſtand any thing, is in ſo many Words
to deny his Divinity.</p>

The next Scripture by him expoſited and by me reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued
was <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>The Word is nigh thee, &amp;c.</hi>
he doth but touch upon it, and gives ſo little of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,

                  <p>But <hi>it is not in Heaven,</hi> therefore it is <hi>not Chriſt,</hi>

it is excluded your Conſciences, or that ye need to ſay,
who ſhall go up to fetch it down, for it is in your Hearts to

<hi>Word of Faith which blots out the Hand-writing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and ends the Ceremonial and Judicial Law:</hi>
But becauſe theſe two Laws or Words cannot be one
and the ſame, and yet that the Apoſtle alludes to the
Words in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> it follows, that it cannot be the
Book of written Laws, but the Word that begets Love
to, and Faith in God; for that was the Word the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
preached: Nay, we may go further yet, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Word, mentioned in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelf; for if that be one with the Word of Faith the
Apoſtle writes of to the <hi>Romans,</hi> then becauſe the Word
of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. is Chriſt, the <hi>Word</hi> mentioned
in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> muſt alſo be Chriſt; that are one and
the ſame Word the Apoſtle's Alluſion proves, and J. F.
<hi>confeſſeth,</hi> and that the Word of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8.
is Chriſt, let the two fore-going Verſes of the Text be
conſulted. <hi>But the Righteouſneſs of Faith ſpeaketh on this
wiſe, Say not in thine Heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven,
that is, to bring</hi> Chriſt <hi>down from above, or who ſhall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
into the deep, that is, to bring up</hi> Chriſt <hi>again from
the Dead; but what ſaith it, The Word is nigh thee, even in
thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that is, the Word of Faith
which we preach,</hi> verſe 6, 7, 8. where nothing is more
clear, then that the <hi>Word</hi> nigh in the Heart, is <hi>Chriſt
the Word;</hi> for the Queſtion here is, how they ſhall get
Chriſt, as it was in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> how they ſhould get the
Word. The Apoſtle anſwers it, though not under the
Name of Chriſt, yet under a Name attributed to Chriſt;
If our Adverſary count Chriſt and the Word of Faith
two differing things, by the ſame Reaſon may we ſay,
that the Word in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> concerning which none
needeth to ask who ſhall go up in Heaven to bring it
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41053:169"/>
down, and the <hi>Word nigh</hi> are two Words; but if that
Queſtion be needleſs, <hi>Who ſhall go up into Heaven to fetch
it down unto us,</hi> ver. 12. be anſwered in ver. 14. viz.
<hi>but the Word is very nigh unto thee,</hi> and conſequently,
that it is but <hi>one Word or Commandment</hi> that is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in the Queſtion and the Anſwer, then may we with
good Reaſon conclude that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the 6th. and 7th.
Verſes, and the <hi>Word of Faith</hi> in the 8th. Verſe are
one and the ſame thing under two Names, elſe there
can be no Sence or Coherence in the Apoſtle's Words;
for what Anſwer is this? <hi>But what ſayes it, The Word
is nigh thee in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that is the
Word of Faith which we preach,</hi> to this Queſtion, <hi>Who
ſhall aſcend to bring Chriſt down? Who ſhall deſcend to
bring Chriſt up.</hi> If Chriſt and Word of Faith are not
Synonimous or equivalent Terms? The Queſtion the
Apoſtle makes the Righteouſneſs of Faith to forbid, is
about Chriſt's Abſence or Remoteneſs from the Heart;
<hi>Say not in thy Heart,</hi> and it is anſwered and reſolved
<hi>with the Nearneſs of the Word in the Heart,</hi> which could
be no anſwer or Solution in caſe <hi>that Word was not Chriſt,
or Chriſt that Word;</hi> for the Reaſon why the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Faith ſaith on this wiſe, <hi>Say not in thy Heart,
who ſhall aſcend to fetch Chriſt down,</hi> implies, that he
is not ſhut up in ſome remote place, <hi>but that he is nigh,</hi>
and needs no fetching; and if nigh, <hi>then not another

                  <p>I know not whether he means the Text or his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to be moſt oppoſite to our Chriſt within. The
Text is <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 27. not 25. and lyes thus, <hi>To whom
God would make known what is the Riches of the Glory of
the Myſtery among the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>which is, Chriſt</hi> IN

that oppoſeth Chriſt's Dwelling in his People; One
would think our Adverſary ſpoak <hi>Ironically</hi> or by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
if he meant it of the Text; for it ſeems an
impoſſible thing to me, that a Text ſo plainly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Chriſt to be <hi>in</hi> Men, ſhould notwithſtanding
prove, <hi>Chriſt not to be in Men.</hi> If he underſtood it
of his Expoſition, how can that truly expoſite the Text,
who expoſites it quite to another ſenſe then it will
bear? at leaſt, he ſhould call this a begging of the
Queſtion. Let us hear what he offers.</p>

in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (rightly underſtood) would be no hard
Matter for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to believe, as to believe ſuch a

                  <p>This ſort of Doctrine well becomes <hi>J. Faldo:</hi> I
perceive I have not miſtaken him. What Carnaliſt
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41053:173"/>
in the World could have let drop a more pernicious
Sentence to the Doctrine and Kingdom of Chriſt, then
to render it more difficult to believe, and lay a greater
Streſs upon the External, then the Internal Work of
Chriſt. VVe muſt read the moſt weighty Scriptures
backwards upon this Man's Principles: He hath help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to a new VVay of rendring the Text; not, <hi>this
Myſtery among the</hi> Gentiles <hi>is Chriſt</hi> IN <hi>you the Hope
of Glory;</hi> but <hi>this Myſtery among the</hi> Gentiles <hi>is a
Man who dyed as a Malefactor, by his Death reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God, &amp;c.</hi> Behold your Expoſitor! I dare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
this Man's Comment will never trouble the next
Collection of Criticks. At this rate the <hi>Lord-Lord-Cryer
is highly priviledged,</hi> and the <hi>Galatians</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the moſt difficult Birth, <hi>before they had known Chriſt
to be formed in them;</hi> Regeneration is a <hi>ſleight</hi> thing
in compariſon of the Knowledge of Chriſt after the
Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine brings not Men to Chriſt in them the
Hope of Glory, but inticeth them into the Vain Hope
of the Hypocrite, which periſheth. The Hiſtory is
made the greateſt Myſtery, and to believe the one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greater Difficulty then to experience the other.
Beſides, why ſhould his Dying as a Malefactor render
him unfit to be believed; ſince his Vertue was moſt
Exemplary, his Miracles ſtupendious, his Doctrine
Spiritual and Powerful, his whole Deportment amongſt
the <hi>Jews</hi> Innocent and Heavenly? Did not <hi>Tiberius</hi>
himſelf move to the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> his being <hi>taken into
the Number of their Godds,</hi> upon the Report of his
mighty Works? 'Tis ſtrange that ſhould be reputed
moſt Myſterious which was the Introduction to the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41053:173"/>
Myſtery; and thoſe Tranſactions counted moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
that were by the Divine Wiſdom of God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
as ſo many facile Repreſentations of what was
to be accompliſhed in Man. In ſhort, It is to leſſen,
if not totally to exclude the True Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
which is Chriſt manifeſted in his Children, their
Hope of Glory. But he proceeds thus.</p>
                  <p>The Man Chriſt that was nailed on the Croſs the
<hi>Quakers</hi> do not believe to be <hi>in</hi> them; for the Godhead
if Chriſt, that is every-where, and every-where alike—he
is <hi>in</hi> every thing at all times, and nothing can be void
of his Preſence. So that if this be it you mean, the
Saints have no more Priviledge then any other Creature
whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond New and Living Man, who is the Lord
from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the Anointed
Saviour, whoſe Body was nailed to the Croſs, we
confeſs before Men to be the Chriſt; and do by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Authority of Scripture aſſert him to dwell <hi>in</hi>
his Children; and we ſee nothing offered by <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
that can induce the weakeſt of us to deſert this Faith,
having with the Teſtimony of Scripture, <hi>that of Chriſt
in our ſelves:</hi> But let it be conſidered with what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
this Man excludeth Chriſt the Souls of his
People, as well with reſpect to his Godhead, as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
but if in any Senſe he may be ſaid to be in
them as God, it is no more <hi>then he is in Cats and
Dogs:</hi> Oh Irreverent, oh prophane Man! <hi>Are Beaſts
and Birds as properly the Temples of the Living God, as
ſanctified Men?</hi> How can God be ſaid <hi>to dwell and
walk in his People,</hi> if ſo remote from them as <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
repreſents him to be? The Apoſtle is much to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
according to our Adverſary's Doctrine, for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

fall this Paſſage, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in
me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. The Upſhot of this ſort of Doctrine
is down-right <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> for as they that know not God
from the manifeſtation of God within, are ignorant
of him, if <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. ſayes true. So thoſe who
teach that God is no more in his Saints then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creature, endeavour to invalidate the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Teſtimony Man can have of a Deity, and to
principle Men for the rankeſt <hi>Atheiſm</hi> that ever was:
Yet ſuch a ſort of a Doctor <hi>J. Faldo</hi> is become, and
of all other Texts in the Bible, from which to preach
it, hath choſen this <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>This Myſtery among the</hi>
Gentiles <hi>is Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of all other doth moſt oppoſe and ſubvert it.
Once more, and he hath done with us upon this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
for this time.</p>
                  <p>—Chriſt is in his People by his Graces, wrought by his
Spirit, which is his Image and Likeneſs—by the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of his Love and Glory, his Works and Image in
and on the Soul—and do as effectually poſſeſs the Soul
for Chriſt his Vſe and Intereſt, as a Faithful Friend can
do, according so that Text, <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in
your Hearts by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>But I would fain know of <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> how Chriſt's
<hi>Graces, Works</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> can be there, and Chriſt
the Workman excluded? If Chriſt be not actually
there, they can never Actually be wrought there;

and conſequently divided from his own Spirit, though
indeed the Lord Chriſt is that Quickening Spirit,
which only makes alive again to God, who is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
and the Life. Oh the Dreadful Darkneſs
that yet over-ſpreads the Hearts of (called) <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans!</hi>
It may be as truly ſaid of them as it was of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> The Vail is yet over them, and Chriſt Jeſus the
Anointed Saviour is unknown to them by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which he effectually worketh in all thoſe
that hearken to his Voice, and are conformed to his
holy Government. They are Witneſſes of his Graces,
Works and Image, <hi>through believing in his Appearance,
and giving up</hi> (like the Clay in the Hand of the Potter)
<hi>to be ordered and diſpoſed by him.</hi> Nor doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he quotes, impugn the Real Preſence of Chriſt in
his People; for, <hi>by Faith Chriſt dwelleth in the Hearts
of his Children;</hi> that is, by believing in Chriſt, <hi>he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to live and dwell in us,</hi> who through the Unbelief
of Men is ſhut out from being Head and Ruler in
them. Our Adverſary would make <hi>Faith and Chriſt's
real Preſence incomparable or inconſiſtent,</hi> whereas the
one cannot poſſibly be enjoyed without the other;
Faith being as the opening of the Door of the Heart
to receive Chriſt in, to be Lord and King; and if
this be not <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Faith, he is void of the Faith of
God's Elect, which purifieth the Heart, and gives to
ſee God, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure

                  <p>No ſuch Matter; But it is plain how much the Man
is upon the Ketches. His Argument led me to ſuch an
Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he calls it, <hi>The Soul or Spirit of a Man,
which is a</hi> conſtitutive <hi>Part of a Man,</hi> pag. 114.
I was therefore led by him to write in that <hi>Abſtract</hi>
Senſe, which thus far makes for him (in caſe he can
maintain his Charge) that the Idolatry would be the
groſſer; Beſides, God is the <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> of the
Soul, therefore there was a Neceſſity for ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>

the God that made Heaven or Earth to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendible
within the Soul of Man—ſo that when we
ſay the Light is within any, we do not intend the whole
Being of Light. <hi>All that</hi> W. P. <hi>denyes here, is but
God's being ſo in the Soul of Man, as that he is no where

to be God eſſential.</hi>

                  <p>It were heartily to be wiſhed, we had nothing but
Ignorance to charge him with in this Paſſage; but
methinks he would not have us to take him for a Man
of ſo little Underſtanding, as he hath need to have, that
writes ſo much Falſhood, and does not know it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> He hath dropt the moſt ſubſtantial part of my
Anſwer in the middle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe Paſſages relate not to the Soul,
but to the Light, upon occaſion of a place he cited out
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41053:177"/>
of <hi>G. Fox</hi> the younger, therefore not applicable to
the Soul, yet by him as well applyed to the Soul as to
the Light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſayes, All that I deny in thoſe words,
he quoted out of my Anſwer, <hi>is only God's being ſo in
the Soul of Man, as that he is no where or nothing elſe,</hi>
which if he had only ſaid it of the Light, it would be
no Contradiction to my Principle or the Truth; for
the Light is as well on the Earth as in the Heavens,
and in my Chamber as in the Firmament, without any
Error in Phyſicks, and ſo may God, whom in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
I called the great Sun of Righteouſneſs, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Spiritual Light to ariſe and ſhine into the Souls
of Men be God as well within as without the Soul;
for where-ever Divine Light is, God is; and where
God is, Divine Light is: Howbeit, we do not call the
Manifeſtation of Light, <hi>God,</hi> though the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His ſaying, That I yet allow the Soul and
Light within to be God eſſential, is a down-right Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as with reſpect to the Soul; it is nigh two pages
before that I conſidered his Charge againſt us about
the Soul; What ſhall I call then his thruſting of it in
here, which cannot be concerned in the very Nature
of the Anſwer? as thus appears, If the Soul be God,
God is comprehended within the Soul, and is no where,
or nothing elſe but Soul, and where the Soul is; An
Abſurdity, yea, a Blaſphemy, never rightly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from any thing I ever ſaid or writ, thus ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
flung upon my Anſwer by <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> for want
of a better Reply; I cannot think that ever man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
(under his Pretences of Religion) ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to pervert, wreſt and miſapply Men's Words
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:41053:178"/>
about Doctrines of the greateſt Importance. This
ſhows he values Credit more then Conſcience, who
undertakes to faſten a Blaſphemous Conſequence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly
on my words, leſt he ſhould be thought to have
charged us beyond what he could prove; but his
Weakneſs bewrayes his Malice: For if the Soul may
be God, and yet I deny that God may be nothing
elſe (his very Words in my Name) then may the
Soul be God, and God the Soul, and yet God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, and that ſomething elſe God. When or
where did I ever give Occaſion for ſuch Biaſphemiſh
<hi>Gibberiſh?</hi> Yet this is the Reſult of what he dares
tell the World is my Meaning. I may ſay the ſame
reſpecting Locallity or Place; for what Man not
ſtark Mad, would ſay the Soul is God, yet deny
not but that God may be elſe-where, which <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
alſo makes (though an expreſs Contradiction to his
wreſts) a piece of my Meaning; for, unleſs God
may be divided from God, where-ever he is, the
Soul is, if the Soul be God; and ſo one Man is in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and every Man <hi>

Citations out of acknowledged <hi>Quakers, I did but nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

or have corrected it better; but I had rather
be guilty of Non-ſenſe then horrible Perverſion, <hi>J. F</hi>'s

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41053:179"/>
which <hi>E. B.</hi> not only intended <hi>but expreſſed of the
Light of Chriſt within Men.</hi> I will ſet down ſome of

                  <p>

Paſſage [Heathens, Turks, Jews, Atheiſts <hi>have that that
doth convince of Sin, yet are ſo far from having the Spirit
of Chriſt in them, that they delight to ſerve their Luſt.</hi>]
Thus expreſſeth himſelf. <q>Do they ſerve Sin or Luſts
becauſe Chriſt hath not given them Light to

Light that is given them?</hi> Tell me,<note place="margin">E. B.'s Works, p. 144.</note> Is not
the Light or Spirit of Chriſt the only Thing
that doth convince of Sin, <hi>Or doth any Thing convince

God and Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>W. P.</hi> That which <hi>E. B.</hi> confeſſeth is of the Light

that ſince Man did under that Degeneration pertake

Abuſes then the Writings of that honeſt and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Man.</p>
                  <p>He tells us of ſome other Quotations which I medled
not with, particularly, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his Book called
the <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould ſay, <hi>The Soul was
Equal with God, that it was without beginning, infinite
in it ſelf and a Part of God;</hi> for which he aſſigns us no
Page in his Reply, in his firſt Book, the 16th; I have
diligently peruſed it and find no ſuch thing; however
ſhould he have ever written theſe Words, I dare ſay
for him, he underſtood no more by <hi>Equality then Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
for God is greater then all; by <hi>Infinite</hi> no more then
ſomething <hi>that is not finite,</hi> or which comes to an End;
<hi>and by the Soul's being without Beginning and a Part of
God,</hi> no other then <hi>that divine Breath of Life,</hi> which
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41053:182"/>
is as the Soul or Life of the Soul, that came out from
God, and therefore is of God; that Cauſe is much
to be ſuſpected that props it ſelf with ſuch ſhallow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
he obſerves no Nicety of Expreſſion in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and it is therefore diſingenuouſly done of any
to make this ill Uſe of his plain and vulgar Phraſes.</p>
                  <p>But leaſt all this ſhould fail, and he had Reaſon to
ſuſpect it, he brings us out a Piece of a Letter, formerly
written by <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi> (who lived and dyed a faithful
Servant of God, and is now at Reſt with him) put into
his Hands, I ſuppoſe by his <hi>Gentle-Man,</hi> p. 94. as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it at the Hand, I ſuppoſe of ſome <hi>Vagabond-Quaker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he ſhould call George Fox <hi>the Father of
many Nations;</hi> but what is this more then to ſay, that
Men of ſeveral Nations have been begat unto Chriſt
through him, Thus Paul <hi>was a Father to the</hi> Romans,
Corinthians, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>for though ye have ten
thouſand Inſtructers, yet ye have not many Fathers;
for in Chriſt have I begotten you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That his Life hath reached through his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to the Iſles afar off, to the begetting of many again
unto a lively Hope.</hi> But what of all this? The life
of God is one in all; <hi>Paul</hi> lived by the Life of Chriſt,
and ſo did <hi>Peter;</hi> Paul <hi>was preſent in Spirit, though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That Generations to come ſhould call him bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi>
But is not the Memory of the juſt bleſſed? <hi>Prov.</hi>
10. 7. and did not God by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> promiſe concerning
<hi>Iſrael, I will make thee an Eternal Excellency, and the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:41053:182"/>
Joy of many Generations,</hi> Iſa. 60. 57. This belongs to <hi>G
Fox, Joſiah Coal,</hi> and every <hi>Child of God;</hi> yea, and
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> too, if he were ſo good as he ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>4thly, <hi>That his Being and Habitation was in the
Power of the Higheſt:</hi> And ſo it ſhould be; for that
is the Habitation of every Child of God; for others
dwell in the Power of the World. In ſhort, we are
exhorted to ſtand faſt in the Power of Godlineſs; and
we read that it was the End of the Evangelical Miniſtry
<hi>to turn People from the Power of Satan unto the Power of
God,</hi> which is the Power of the Higheſt.</p>
                  <p>5thly, <hi>That he ruled and governed in Righteouſneſs:</hi>
This is but what <hi>Paul</hi> exorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to do in the Church
of Chriſt, as both his Epiſtles inform us at large; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Elder, Overſeer or Paſtor in the Church of Chriſt is
bound to do ſo;</hi> If <hi>J. F.</hi> can prove he doth otherwiſe,
he may then charge him with uncomely walking, but
not <hi>J. Coal</hi> with Blaſphemy for ſaying, <hi>that a good Man
governs in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>That his Kingdom is eſtabliſhed in Peace, and
the Increaſe thereof is without End:</hi> So is the Kingdom
of the Saints of God. That they have a Kingdom and
Dominion is clear from ſeveral Scriptures: <hi>It is the
Fathers good Pleaſure to give you a</hi> KINGDOM,
Luke 12. 23. <hi>Wherefore we have received a</hi> KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM
<hi>which cannot be ſhaken,</hi> Heb. 12. 28. <hi>The
Saints ſhall</hi> JUDGE <hi>the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 3. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Kingdom is declared. Luke 17. 12. <hi>The
Kingdom of God is within.</hi> Joh. 18. 36. <hi>My Kingdom

God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace

Our Doctrine maintained by Scripture,
Reaſon and Authorities.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN his former Book he charged us with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
of the Reſurrection of the Dead, and Eternal
Recompence.</hi> The Teſtimonies he brought for Proof
were ſuch as rendred him very weak, or ſomething
worſe, I hope they were ſufficiently diſ-engaged from
his Service, unto which, according to his old Cuſtom,
he hath not thought fit to reply: He only takes notice
of two or three ſhort Paſſages out of ſix or ſeven pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Anſwer, on which he beſtows a few Squibs,
and concludes with that Contempt and Rudeneſs no
Man pretending to <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Humanity</hi> would have
vented, eſpecially againſt a Man that he provok't to
anſwer him, by beginning to abuſe his Friends in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and him in particular; conſidering withal, that
his Profeſſion is to ſuffer, not to inſult. Strange! that
my <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſhould ſubject me to ſo
much Contempt, with a Man that pretends to both.
But <hi>W. P.</hi> I dare ſay, had not been thus treated by
<hi>J. F.</hi> could he threaten the Law, and Flant and Swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at the rate <hi>J. F.</hi> doth. But it is like ſuch Folk,
to inſult where he may do it ſafely.</p>
               <p>One of his Teſtimonies was this, <hi>Chriſt is the
Reſurrection, to raiſe up that which</hi> Adam <hi>loſt, and to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41053:186"/>
deſtroy him who deceived him; So Chriſt is the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

what I ſaid in Defence of this Paſſage, as to
the End he deſigned it; Nothing can be clearer, then
that this concerns <hi>Regeneration,</hi> ſo ſayes <hi>J. F.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
pag. 132. conſequently the <hi>Reſurrection of Dead
Bodies is not concerned in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond Teſtimony fell from <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in
theſe words, if we may believe him; <hi>I do not believe
this Body ſhall riſe again after it is Dead.</hi> I told him of
his Diſingenuous Catching, and put him in mind of

NOT <hi>that Body that ſhall be.</hi> But unto
whatever I urged for the clearing of our Friends
Words and Writings from his ill Conſtructions, like
an unfair, if not a fearful Adverſary, he makes no

                  <p>Is this the Scripture-Doctrine, he ſays <hi>I oppoſe with
Philoſophical Concluſions?</hi> Would he would give us but
one Scripture that looks but favourably towards this
Reply; I never read one yet <hi>of a Body's having the
ſame Matter, and not the ſame Groſneſs, the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and Eſſence, and not the ſame Accidents.</hi> For
ſhame; muſt our Denyal of <hi>Phyſical Nicities,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Abſurdities be branded for <hi>horrid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
'Tis true in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that a <hi>Subſtance</hi> may
looſe its <hi>Accidents,</hi> and yet remain the ſame Subſtance.
Things may be diſcolour'd, yet the ſame Beings they
were before: But that Matter ſhould be ſuch, and not
groſs, is incongruous with Scripture and <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>
Matter and Groſneſs or Corruption are <hi>Synonimous</hi> in
<hi>Philoſophy</hi> and common Speech: But that Groſneſs, or
the <hi>Subſtantial Part</hi> of any Man's Body ſhould be but
an <hi>Accident,</hi> that the <hi>Accidence</hi> teaches all Boyes in a
<hi>Noun-Subſtantive,</hi> deſerves a Laſh at leaſt. Are Fleſh,
Blood and Bones <hi>Accidents,</hi> or that of them which is
groſs and corruptible an <hi>Accident?</hi> I wonder what a
fearful ſort of a Noun-Subſtantive <hi>J. F.</hi> would be in
caſe he were <hi>condens'd</hi> and <hi>rarefied</hi> of ſuch <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Accidents,</hi> Indeed one would think his Head,
if not all the reſt, had been near akin to them, when
he writ this piece of <hi>new Philoſophy.</hi> But this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
proveth upon what Foot his Reſurrection
ſtandeth, if it may be ſaid to have any, or to ſtand at
all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faellacious</hi> is but one of his hard words; for if the
Body rifeth with the ſame Matter it carried to the
Grave, it riſeth with groſs Matter, unleſs it carried no
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41053:188"/>
groſs Matter thither. Let him chuſe of the two which
to deny. But is this to anſwer my Argument, to tell
us with ſo much unwarranted Confidence, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhall be the ſame Matter, Subſtance and Eſſence, &amp;c.
the very Queſtion? What is this but to ſay, It ſhall be
ſo, becauſe it <hi>ſhall be ſo?</hi> If he would have done any
thing, <hi>he ſhould have demonſtrated how Matter can be
without Groſneſs, and the moſt groſs and Material part
of the Body to be but the Accidents.</hi> But he thinks he
hath ſaid ſomething to the Point.</p>

                  <p>The Queſtion was not about God's Power; nor was
it ſo much as any Part of the Queſtion; But <hi>whether
Matter is not by Nature corruptible, and how that which
is corruptible by Nature, may be by Nature incorruptible.</hi>
This Scripture he urges to prove his carnal Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will as well prove the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, or
any the moſt unreaſonable Conceit in the World; for
it is but ſaying, <hi>All things are poſſible with God, and God
is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf;</hi> and the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is done at <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s rate of arguing. But the

                  <p>I know there are Impoſſibilities in Nature, which

doth not know that there is a Difference between Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
in Nature, and <hi>Contrariety to Nature,</hi> I now
tell him there is one, and that ſo wide, as though Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God frequently ſupplies Nature's Want of
Power, yet he rarely, if ever, acts contrary to and
inconſiſtent with the Nature of his own Creatures;
What is ſpiritual remains <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> what is material
<hi>material,</hi> and what is corruptible <hi>corruptible.</hi> But let

Reaſon is, that the Loſs and Change of Nature from
corruptible to incorruptible, natural to ſpiritual ſhould
not make it another Body. <hi>That it is according to

pertinent to this Part of my Anſwer; yet he promiſed
he would anſwer my Arguments. For the Scripture, it
is clear, <hi>That Corruption ſhall not inherit Incorruption;
neither can Fleſh and Blood inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 50. Thus <hi>Anota. cert. Divin. anno</hi> 1645.

they ly in our Engliſh Tranſlation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is ſown a Natural Body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual
Body; and ſo its written, The firſt Man</hi> Adam <hi>was
made a</hi> Living Soul, <hi>the laſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a</hi> Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit; <hi>howbeit that was not firſt which is ſpiritual,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41053:190"/>
but that which is Natural, and afterward, that which
is Spiritual; The firſt Man is of the</hi> Earth Earthy, <hi>the
ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>is the Lord</hi> from Heaven; <hi>As is the</hi> Earthy,
<hi>ſo are they that are</hi> Earthy; <hi>and as is the</hi> Heavenly,
<hi>ſo are they alſo which are</hi> Heavenly; <hi>and as we have
born the</hi> Image of the Earthy, <hi>we ſhall alſo bear the</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Heavenly, v. 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. I
ſay this doth not concern the Reſurrection of carnal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but the <hi>two States</hi> of Men under the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam,</hi> Men are ſown into the World natural,
and ſo they are the Sons of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but they are
raiſed ſpiritually, through him who is the Reſurrection
and the Life, &amp; ſo they are the Sons of the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi>
the Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit. The very
Words of the Apoſtle undeniably prove this to be the
Scope; how elſe could the firſt <hi>Adam's</hi> being made a
<hi>living Soul,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Adam a Quickning Spirit,</hi>
be a pertinent Inſtance to prove Natural and ſpiritual
Bodies; upon which follows, that the Natural was
firſt, that is, <hi>the firſt Adam, and then that which is</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
<hi>which is the ſecond Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit,
the Lord from Heaven, who came to raiſe up the Sons
of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> from their <hi>Dead</hi> to his <hi>Living,</hi>
their <hi>Natural</hi> to his <hi>Spiritual Eſtate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But perhaps it will be objected that the 47th Verſe,
<hi>The firſt Man is of the Earth Earthy,</hi> and part, of the
9th. Verſe, <hi>We ſhall alſo bear the Image of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
ſeem to imply a bodily Reſurrection; But let the
whole. Verſes be conſidered, and we ſhall find no ſuch
thing. The firſt Man is of the <hi>Earth, Earthy, The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Man is the Lord from Heaven;</hi> who ſees not that
this is rather ſpoken of the <hi>Earthy-Mindedneſs,</hi> then
the Earthy Body of <hi>Adam?</hi> It was mentioned to ſhow
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:41053:190"/>
the great Diſparity, that is between the Nature and
Qualification of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Verſe puts this Interpretaion out of Doubt, <hi>as
is the Earthy, ſuch are they that are Earthy; and as is
the Heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are Heavenly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thoſe Words, <hi>We ſhall alſo bear the Image of the
Heavenly.</hi> I cannot ſee how they ſhould relate to the
Reſurrection of the Carnal Bodies of Men; for the
<hi>Image of the Heavenly,</hi> is a renewed State to God,
through the Operation of the Spirit and Power of
Chriſt, the firſt Part of the Verſe clears it; <hi>and as we
have born the Image of the Earthy, we ſhall</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>let us bear</hi>) the Image of the Heavenly) as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
and <hi>Theophilact</hi> read it, and ſix or ſeven Copies
beſides have it) which is as much as to ſay, <hi>That as we
having born the Image of the God of this World, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his Children; ſo may we bear the Image of the
True and Living God, by being redeemed from a vain
Converſation, having our Conſciences ſprinkled from
dead Works, and being born again of the incorruptible
Seed by the Word of God which lives and abides forever.</hi>
Had this concerned the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in our Adverſary's Senſe,<note n="*" place="margin">If it be objected, <hi>that</hi> Adam <hi>is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as degenerated, but as created, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Interpretation will not do.</hi> I anſwer; 'tis true he is ſaid to be made a living Soul; but firſt, this makes not for the Reſurrection of dead Bodies, and ſo far our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary gets no Strength. 2ly, Though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle beings with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Creation, yet he orderly comes to the Earthly Image, that the living Soul put on by Diſobedience, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth the Neceſſity of the coming of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Quickning Spirit to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a new, bring into the Image of God. So there is <hi>Adam</hi> as ſown and his Poſterity repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in him, and his and their Laps, and then the Reſtoration by him that is the Reſurrection and the Life, the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the Lord from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven however</note>
the <hi>Image</hi> would be changed
wholy (Accidents would not
ſerve his Turn) therefore not
the ſame Image, unleſs the
<hi>Earthy could be the Heavenly
Image,</hi> which were Impoſſible;
for we ſhould looſe our Earthly
Bodies, at what time we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>the Image of the Heavenly,</hi>
in this World, if this conceit had
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41053:191"/>
any Truth in it, and if of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they to be ſure muſt never
enter; for another takes Place:
But as it was never underſtood
ſo by any that I know of, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore
of that <hi>Earthly Image</hi>
which came by tranſgreſſion,
and the <hi>Heavenly Image</hi> that
comes in obeying the Truth by
the Spirit, according to what the
Apoſtle ſaith, Col. 3. 8 9, 10.
<hi>But now you alſo put off all theſe,
Anger, Wrath, Blaſphemy, filthy
Fornication out of your mouths,
lye not one to another; ſeeing that
you have put off the old Man with
his Deeds, and have put on the

his Diſcourſe of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> with this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s. <q> We come now to the ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
propounded, the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi>
which I dare ſay the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will liſten to, with more
then ordinary Attention, <hi>and greedily ſuck in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
provided it be ſtated with the moſt curious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that the</hi> RIDGIDEST OF THEOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GERS
<hi>will deſcribe it by, that we ſhall have the ſame</hi>
NUMERICAL <hi>Bodies, in which we lived here on
Earth, and that thoſe very Bodies</hi> (the Molds being
turned aſide) <hi>ſhall ſtart out of the Grave.</hi> This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the <hi>Atheiſt very dearly hugs as a Pledge</hi> in his
bold Conceit <hi>of the Falſneſs and Vanity of all the other
Articles of Religion;</hi> wherefore he fancying the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be ſo groundleſs and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he fairly quits himſelf of the Trouble of all,
and yields himſelf up wholely to the Pleaſures of this
preſent World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Objection of <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who play hard upon
<hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Carnal Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that <hi>Canables</hi> proper Bodies are made up
the Fleſh of other Men, ſo as if every one had his own,
he would have never a Body in the Reſurrection. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
That it implies that all Men are buried, when
as <hi>Myriads</hi> are drowned in the Sea, and eaten by Fiſhes.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:41053:192"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Men's Bodies are paſſing like Rivers,
conſequently no more the ſame <hi>Numerical</hi> Bodies, then
the Water that runs away is the ſame River; and upon
this ſcore the Body of an Old Man muſt pay for the Sine
of a Young Man, whoſe youthful Body felt the Pleaſure,
and is gone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He thus anſwers out of the beſt ſort of Philoſophers,
<q>That the Soul of every Man is his individial Perſon,
and that ſhe alone it is that <hi>ſees, hears, enjoyes</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and <hi>undergoes</hi> Pain, and that the Body is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of any thing, no more then a Man's Dublet when
he is well Baſtinado'd; and this Anſwer (ſayes he)
takes away all the firſt and laſt Cavil (he goes on)
and why do Men plead for the Conſociation of the
Soul's numerical Body in Reward or Puniſhment,
<hi>but that they fancy the Body capable of Pleaſure &amp; Pain;
but they err, not knowing the Nature of things;</hi> the Body
being utterly uncapable of all Senſe and Cogitation,
as not only the beſt <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> but alſo that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Philoſopher <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> hath determined, and
is abundantly demonſtrated in my Treatiſe of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity
of the Soul.</hi> See Book 2. Chap. 2, 4, 5, 6.
To the ſecond Cavil I anſwer, That the Univerſal
Expreſſion of Men's riſing out of the Grave, <hi>is but a
Prophetical Scheme of Speech,</hi> the more ſtrongly to

one Book that was ever wrought by any of us, in which it
is not abundantly implied, if not moſt plainly expreſſed:
Were there no ſuch thing, it would belong to us, above
all other People, to uſe the Apoſtles Words, <hi>We are of
all Men moſt miſerable;</hi> but God hath fixed that Hope
of Immortality and Eternal Life in our Souls, which all
<hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Clamours will be too weak to ſhake. But
were we darker in this Point (then whom none are
clearer) we and our Books have <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi>
and their Writings to keep us company, who mention
it but obſcurely, and not ſo frequently and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as we do. <hi>J. Faldo</hi> loves to hear talk of Heaven,
but deſpiſes and ſhuns the Way which leads to it; and
becauſe our greateſt Pains are imployed in bringing
People into that ſtreight and narrow Way that leads thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:41053:196"/>
rather then by <hi>delicious Fables</hi> to preach them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Hope of Heaven, whilſt in a State of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God's Holy Spirit, therefore is it that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
us not to believe Eternal Rewards, that is, to
deny them. Never did Man catch at ſuch broken Reeds
to ſave himſelf from the juſt Abhorrence of all ſober
People. We deny his <hi>Carnal Refurrection,</hi> therefore
we muſt <hi>needs deny Eternal Rewards.</hi> Again, We do

<hi>yet he never read ſo, much leſs found</hi> it ſo by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
and therefore could never quote it ſo. If we
ſpeak of Salvation, unleſs we put <hi>future</hi> or <hi>eternal</hi> to it,
he confines it to this World; he deals ſo with <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Hell;</hi> boldly concluding, from what we ſay, Men
feel and know of thoſe things here, our Diſ-Belief of
any ſuch thing hereafter. I told him of <hi>B. Hall</hi> and
<hi>T. Brooks,</hi> their Books entituled, <hi>Heaven upon Earth,</hi>
but he ſayes nothing to that. In ſhort, he ſeems to
have made it his Buſineſs to render us but as odious, as

or candid, conſidering that I refumed the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in oppoſite Terms, could think I intended it not
to oppoſite Ends? That is, when <hi>J. Faldo</hi> tells us, <hi>that
we deny the Scriptures and all the Ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
and we anſwer, that we do not deny the Scriptures
or any Ordinance of the Goſpel, that we thereby do not
mean; or theſe Words do not imply <hi>an Acknowledging of

Suppoſe any Man charges <hi>J. Faldo</hi> with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
of the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and
Baptiſm and the Supper to be Ordinances of the Goſpel,
and he ſhall anſwer, <hi>I do not deny the Scriptures to be the

of the Goſpel:</hi> Are we to conclude, <hi>that</hi> J. Faldo
<hi>acknowledged the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and
thoſe Ordinances to be Goſpel, no more then an Horſe or
Gooſe?</hi> I will form it into an Argument for his Sake.</p>

                     <hi>He that denyes the Scriptures and Ordinances of the

Goſpel, is no true Chriſtian;</hi> But <hi>W. P.</hi> (ſayes <hi>J. Faldo)
denyes the Scriptures and Goſpel Ordinances;</hi> Therefore
<hi>W. P. is no true Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> or ſecond Propoſition; I query
then, if I ought not to be underſtood, <hi>to own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Goſpel Ordinances?</hi> If not, there is no Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
If I ought to be ſo underſtood, was it ingenuous
or juſt in him ſo to cavil? But that his Honeſty and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
may yet more clearly appear, I will give his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in this plain Argument, wherein I wrong him not
one Tittle. <hi>Whoſoever denyes not the Scriptures and
Goſpel Ordinances is a true Chriſtian:</hi> But <hi>an</hi> Horſe <hi>or
a</hi> Gooſe <hi>doth not deny the Scriptures and Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;</hi>
Therefore <hi>a</hi> Horſe <hi>or a</hi> Gooſe, <hi>according to</hi>
J. Faldo, <hi>is a true</hi> Chriſtian. I know he would fling this
Abſurdity upon me; but he right well deſerves it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who would extend the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition beyond
its Bounds; for it was not <hi>Who</hi> or <hi>Whatſoever</hi> did not
deny Chriſtianity, thereby including <hi>all Sorts of Beings
and Things</hi> (which made a Gap for his <hi>Horſe</hi> and his
<hi>Gooſe</hi>) but if <hi>Quakers</hi> or <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> ſo called (of whom
was the Controverſie, and muſt either deny or own)
<hi>do not deny the Scriptures, &amp;c. it follows, they own the
Scriptures, &amp;c.</hi> for by the ſame Rule that his owning
the Scriptures includes no Denyal of the Scriptures, it

                        </gap>owning of the Scriptures,</hi> or elſe his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proves nothing; for if it ſtands not upon the Rule
of Contraries, it will follow, <hi>that we may deny them,
and yet own them,</hi> for not denying them (though there
be no <hi>Medium</hi>) is with him <hi>no owning them.</hi> But what

not another, yet not the ſame,</hi> ſayes he; Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
judge in this Caſe: My Adverſary in his firſt Book,
2d Part, p. 144. begins thus, <hi>If Quakeriſm be an
other Diſpenſation then that of Chriſt ſettled and preached
by the Apoſtles:</hi> Now what is plainer, then that this is
a <hi>Negative,</hi> as well as mine; <hi>for another Diſpenſation
is not the ſame.</hi> Next, doth it not imply, <hi>that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm</hi>
(ſo called) <hi>is not Chriſtianity, if another Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</hi>
And why may it not follow, if it be not another
Diſpenſation, <hi>that it is the ſame with that of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
Is not this implyed as ſtrongly and clearly as his
Conſequence in the contrary Propoſition? Why ſhould
his <hi>Negative</hi> paſs, and mine be ſtopt; or his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
hold, and not mine? He will have, That if
Quakeriſm be another Diſpenſation, <hi>then not the ſame;</hi>
but I muſt not be allowed to infer, If Quakeriſm (ſo
called) be not another Diſpenſation, <hi>it is the ſame;</hi> as
if it were not alike to ſay, <hi>If Quakeriſm</hi> (ſo called)
<hi>be not another Diſpenſation then the ſame:</hi> Or thus; <hi>If
Quakeriſm</hi> (ſo called) <hi>be the ſame Diſpenſation, then
not another.</hi> Our Controverſie lay upon <hi>abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,</hi>
not upon things <hi>only indifferent,</hi> as <hi>Geometry, &amp;c.</hi>
for they are neither for, nor againſt Chriſtianity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

yet ſo he concludes <hi>per fas per nefas:</hi> What can

               <p>
                  <hi>But this is not all, he tells me on this only Occaſion,</hi>
I have not the Fear of God before mine Eyes; The Words
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:41053:206"/>
of my Mouth are Iniquity and Deceit; That I left off to
be wiſe and to do good; that I ſet my ſelf in a Way that
is not good, and abhor not Evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Upon this Text he preaches my Infamy and Diſgrace,
but with an Abuſe to the Text as well as to me, and all
for that only Paſſage. Nay, the Book-Sellers, <hi>J. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>

are brought forth with a <hi>Fearful</hi> WHEREAS againſt
<hi>W. P.</hi> upon no other ſcore then to buoy up the Book's
Sale and the Author's Credit; And by this pair of Book-Sellers,
whom I know not (and I ſcarcely think ever
heard of, eſpecially the latter) much leſs had I ever
harmed them, am I call'd all to nought, <hi>unleſs Notorious,
Falſe, Diſhoneſt, Impudent, Brazen-faced Detractor</hi>
are no ſuch thing; and this in one page, and that in a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate</hi>
too, as if they had not been giving meer Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
but <hi>Sentence,</hi> and that after a municipal Proceed
of a <hi>Billingſgate</hi> Judicature. But I forgive them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Words call neither of them Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two things I ſhall obſerve: Firſt,</hi> That his Book has
had general Acceptance by Learned Divines, both of
Conformiſts and Non-Conformiſts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we
have endeavoured to prevent the Sale of <hi>J. F.</hi>'s Book.</p>
               <p>To the firſt I anſwer, <hi>their Learned Divines</hi> I know
not; and how ſhould I, their Names are concealed?
But granting what theſe Men ſay, it proves nothing:
I could produce the Letters of Men, of known Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Learning and Quality, not only in <hi>England,</hi>
but abroad in the World, to ballance the Scale, <hi>who
condemned his Enterpriſe of Weakneſs, Vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Wickedneſs</hi> heartily embracing the Anſwer as
a Check but due to his Exorbitances. But let it be as
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:41053:207"/>
it will in the Eſteem of Men; we the poor traduced
<hi>Quakers</hi> have a further Appeal and expect an higher
Judgment: In the mean time, we reſt in God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and deſire to purſue our Chriſtian Duty.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Paſſage I do aver, they have wronged
us; <hi>for we never endeavoured any ſuch thing as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Sale of our Adverſaries Book, therefore in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Words they have certified an abſolute Vntruth;</hi> which
ill becomes Men pretending to Conſcience, as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them doth, going under the Name (as I take it)
of an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> but I ſuppoſe ſome what BECALMED.</p>
               <p>This I thought to have prefixt in Form of a <hi>Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
under ſeveral Hands, after their Example; but I
had more Regard to the Weight and Gravity of my
Diſcourſe, then to ſeem ſo concerned for my Reputation
about a very <hi>Trifle,</hi> wherein, had they what they deſire,
<hi>J. F</hi>'s Book would appear never the leſs impious, nor
my Anſwer one Jot leſs formidable; and ſo I end with
him upon this Score.</p>
               <p>His next Diſturbance at me, is in p. 43, 44, 45. of
his Reply; on this Occaſion: He would needs turn
<hi>Hangman</hi> to us in his former Book, ſaying, <hi>That now
he was come to the higheſt Round of the Ladder,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
in order to execute us: But I was ſo Modeſt,
as to uſe no Word ſo groſs to him, only inverted the
Alluſion, and turned his Simile back upon him, thus: <hi>I
will not ſay for what an Army Chaplain might deſerve to be
ſo highly exalted; but ſince his eager Purſuit after an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
People, hath brought him actually thither, and it fals
to my Share to be his Executioner, I ſhall take all the Care
I can, to acquit my ſelf well of my Employment.</hi> At this
he rages beyond-meaſure, though he be only entangled
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:41053:207"/>
in a Rope of his own providing. He muſt needs be
medling with <hi>Laddes,</hi> and <hi>truſſing</hi> up the poor <hi>Quakers</hi>
and their Principles, without all Civility, Mercy or
Juſtice; and becauſe I improved his own Similitude to
the Diſpatch of his Cauſe, that he had deſigned to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
the Execution of us and ours by; He, as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
himſelf, calls me <hi>Hangman, Bungler, infallible Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
and in plain Terms <hi>Fool.</hi> But this is little to what
is behind; for it ſeems, I am not enough for him to
wreak his Diſpleaſure upon, and therefore of all others
my <hi>deceaſed Father,</hi> whoſe Grave with <hi>Heathens</hi> had
been a Guard from all Reflections (eſpecially, when
as unconcerned as what was never born, in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie)
muſt be fetcht up to anſwer for his Sons Micarriage
(if ſuch it had been) his Words are theſe.</p>
               <p>But why an Army-Chaplain deſerves that Preferment
more then a military Sea-Captain, his Father's Character.</p>
               <p>Inſolence and Pride! for Shame, <hi>John Faldo,</hi> ſhall
the moſt Barbarous Nations make it a ſtanding Axiom,
<hi>De Mortuis nil niſi bonum;</hi> And doth <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> a <hi>Non-conforming
Miniſter,</hi> that ſhould be more humble from
his Profeſſion and Meaneſs, break that laudable Saying
by <hi>De mortuis nil niſi malum.</hi> Strange! But why my
Father of all others? Did he ever wrong him? But
had he; where is <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Chriſtianity in the Point?
<hi>Is this the Way to prove Quakeriſm, none?</hi> One would

ſhall I ſtomach his Compariſon or diminutive Epithetes.
His Queſtion I therefore refuſe to anſwer, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obſerving Perſon may eaſily ſatisfie himſelf, as to the
vaſt Diſparity that is between the Station and Service of
<hi>every ſuch one</hi> and an <hi>Army-Chaplain;</hi> for it is but to
diſtinguiſh between the Preſervation of a Man's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from the Rapes and Spoils of Forreigners, <hi>and the
ruining it by turning Incendiary, kindling Animoſities
and blowing them into Domeſtick Wars,</hi> and the Queſtion
is fully anſwered. However, I would have <hi>J. F.</hi> be more
careful how he medles with the Men of that Element;
for if they ſhould know of his <hi>baſe Reflections and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,</hi>
they would, I aſſure him, do more then point
at him, as he ſaid of <hi>his Book-Sellers</hi> to me.</p>
               <p>The next Paſſages in my Anſwer which trouble him
not a little, are theſe two, that I ſhould ſay to theſe
Words, <hi>poor Non-Conformiſts;</hi> 
                  <q>but why poor Non-conformiſts
after all their preacht up Battels, Spoils,
Plunders, Sacriledges, Decimations, &amp;c. as Rich and
Covetous as ever. Again, upon the Deſcription of the
<hi>True Miniſtry,</hi> I ſaid, No, they are true Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and their Feet truly beautiful, whoſe Goſpel is
Peace on Earth, and Good-Will towards Men; and
not Garments roled in the Blood of Kings and Princes
Rulers and People. No Worldly Armies, Battels,
Spoils, Sequeſtrations, Decimations, &amp;c. in which
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> and his poor Non-conforming Miniſters
have had their Hands, &amp;c. p. 52, 53, 62.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This may perhaps ſound harſh; but I ſhall eaſily take

for our <hi>Eſtates, Houſes and plentiful Subſiſtances;</hi> and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:41053:208"/>
having firſt abuſed us by making it neceſſary to a True
Miniſter after our Principle, <hi>to have no Houſe,</hi> jeers at
our Poverty and envies our Proſperity; bidding ſuch
as had no dwelling Places, <hi>to repair to</hi> William Penn
<hi>and ſuch other</hi> Quakers <hi>for an Anſwer, who have large
Poſſeſſions and brave Habitations, ſuch as few Miniſters,
eſpecially the poor</hi> Non-Conformiſts <hi>enjoy.</hi> Upon this
I depainted what ſome of their Miniſtry had been, and
what it is; not varying one Tittle from the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of them, ſo far as I know it. <hi>What had he to do
with our Livings? What with our Miniſtry? Shall he
rant uncontroleably? Has he a Priviledge to make us Fools
and Knaves at Pleaſure without Contradiction? Is there
no</hi> Superſedeas <hi>to ſuch</hi> Unchriſtian <hi>Proceed? We muſt be
abuſed if Poor, and jeered or envied if Rich;</hi> and that
by a Man, who is one of that Tribe which hath given
the ſignalleſt Proof of a falſe Miniſtry, by the great
Degeneracy of the late Times, whereinto they were
not only fallen; but have been the <hi>Ring-Leaders</hi> unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
corrupted by it. But I beſeech my Reader to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his <hi>Reply</hi> to what he thus drew upon his own Head.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That my Accuſations are falſe,</hi> which is ſooner
ſaid then proved; twenty Years have made them good.</p>
               <p>2. That I have like an <hi>accurſed</hi> Ham, <hi>diſcovered my
Father's Nakedneſs.</hi> No ſuch Matter <hi>J Faldo,</hi> That
<hi>Fig-Leaf</hi> will not cover thine. My Father was no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Incendiary, much leſs an <hi>Army Chaplain</hi> or
<hi>Parſon;</hi> of ſuch I ſpoak. <hi>He complotted none of thoſe
Tragedies,</hi> nor was his Eſtate advanced by any of the
conſequential Gains: <hi>His Family never ſaw two Pence
of any Sequeſtration or Decimation Money, nor poſſeſt
one Foot of King's, Queens or Church Lands,</hi> though
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:41053:209"/>
perhaps ſome honeſt Men did. Accuſe that can, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he will prove, or elſe he had better hold his
Tongue. I can ſay, and that with Sincerity to God
and Man, that <hi>after twenty five Years of publick and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eminent</hi> Sea <hi>&amp;</hi> Land Employs (<hi>requiring much Time,
Prudence, Care, Faithfulneſs, Government) and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Opportunities he had to ſwell his Eſtate to a very
conſiderable Bulk, and that as laudably as any publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
raiſe themſelves, he departed this World with a moſt
clear Conſcience in all thoſe Reſpects, leaving not half
that which many</hi> London Shopkeepers <hi>arrive at by their
private Acquiſitions.</hi> Baſe then and unworthy with a
Witneſs, to bring him or me into your Society; We
are unconcern'd in thoſe Enormities, for which I juſtly
made the Reflection.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>But he ſayes, that</hi> I ſpit Defiance againſt the Kings
Gracious Laws, and Act of Oblivion; that if I be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
I will call for Fire from Heaven to devour the
whole Stock and Kindred of one that offends me.</p>
               <p>God forbid, and forgive him. I would rather dye my
ſelf then bring any ſuch Dammage upon any of you:
But you are to be put in Mind of old Times, <hi>to humble
you; Some of you perk up ſo high, as if none were fit
Guides for Heaven but your ſelves, &amp; would ſit Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
upon other Mens Religion without Contradiction,
and yet have given ſuch eminent Proofs of your Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
freſh in our Memory.</hi> I have not ſaid half ſo much
as JOHN CANN, the old <hi>Independent Paſtor,</hi> left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him in his little Treatiſe, called, <hi>The Time of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
which is an Entire Teſtimony aginſt your <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
for ſo the old Man calls it, and the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſince his
day, preferring <hi>the worſt of the former Biſhops</hi> before
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:41053:209"/>
you. See his <hi>Epiſt. Dedicat.</hi> Moſt ſharp are his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions</hi>
of you in the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>To talk of the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> is not ſo pertinent,
as to live that humble Life your former Miſcarriages
ſhould in very Prudence engage you to. This were a
better Uſe of the King's Clemency, then to trouble
the World with ſuch unneceſſary Conteſts, eſpecially
when they expoſe other more harmleſs Diſſenters to the
Severity of the miſinformed Magiſtrate, and rude Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and prejudice the Minds of ſober Inquirers againſt
them: This is to be as bad out of Power; as you were
in it.</p>
               <p>Neither would I be underſtood to have ſpoken of all
Sorts of <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> (having alwayes been one my
ſelf, and a true Lover of the Honeſt of them) which
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> takes great Pains to inſinuate; No: Nor of
all called <hi>Miniſters,</hi> neither. I aim'd at ſuch only
<hi>who
remain in their Partial, Narrow, Bitter, Spirit,</hi> unfit
for God and Men. 'Tis notorious to all inquiſitive
Minds, what Miſery theſe Nations have been reduc't to,
through the pernicious Councils, horrid Flatteries and
moſt partial and ambitious Practices of many of the
<hi>Non-conforming</hi> Clergy when time was; They alwayes
ſtood in the Way of whatever tended to the true Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of this Mighty Nation from greateſt Thraldom.
I could particularize in twenty great Inſtances, and
bring the Complaint of many conſiderable Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, Many <hi>Pamphlets</hi> are extant that loudly
ſpeak the ſame, eſpecially two, call'd <hi>The firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Narrative of the late Parliament's Proceedings,</hi> &amp;c.
printed Anno 1658. and 1659. as I take it, in which
the greateſt <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> the moſt deteſtable <hi>Falſeneſs</hi>
to God and Men, and a Sort of <hi>Flattery</hi> to their new
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:41053:210"/>
                  <hi>Monarchy,</hi> exceding all modern <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yea, <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi>
it ſelf, are brought to Light, and laid at the Doors
chiefly of the Prieſthood among all Perſwaſions in any
Power at that time; Out of which and ſeveral others
I have extracted about one Sheet, which I intended for
the Preſs, but pure Tenderneſs to thoſe that acted with
Integrity and Conſcience, ſtopt its Publication: I was
careful not to give any Occaſion for them to be born
hard upon by ſuch as knew not well how to diſtinguiſh
between Perſons and Things that differ; though ſuch
as I meant, well deſerve it from us, that when in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
perſecuted us, contrary to their own Engagements,
and now out of Power malign and abuſe us by ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Reports and invective Libels: Nor is it wholly
laid aſide, though <hi>pro tempore</hi> ſuſpended: New Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
may give Occaſion for their Hiſtory to come
abroad to the Nation more compendiouſly then ever.
A Work I take no Pleaſure in, but am heartily ſorry,
that ſuch as have given that juſt Occaſion for Rebuke,
ſhould (as not having their Fill of us before) fall ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
on us now about Religion, who have ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prov'd themſelves falſe to God, Religion and the
Kingdom; and thereby neceſſitated us to rip them up
and ſhow how nauſeous this Officiouſneſs of theirs is;
as if they thought to expiate old Crimes and prove
themſelves Zealous for Religion, by perverting, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and gainſaying ours. This is the preſent Plague
that infects the Families of but too many, through the
ſecret Inſtigations of their Miniſters, yet too inward
with them: And I know, that the moſt honourable left
among Diſſenters, lament at this Day the Stingeneſs of
their Clergy, whoſe Fierceneſs is rather encreaſed (then
leſſen'd) with their Loſs of Power. But ſuch generous
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:41053:210"/>
Perſons, as have acted truly upon Conſcience, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the beſt of their Underſtandings, and have ever
continued immoveable for General and National Good,
no Man holds them in greater Value then my ſelf; I
wiſh for every ſuch one the King and Kingdom had a
Thouſand. It is an Abuſe therefore in my Adverſary to
extend my Words to <hi>all Non-conformiſts,</hi> which only
relate to the <hi>Narrow-Spirited, Angry and Imperious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among
their Teachers.</hi> And if it be for my Plain Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them, he (like himſelf and his Cauſe) threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
me <hi>with the Puniſhment of the Judge, Law,</hi> and I

(at what time he pleads the King's Oblivion (ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the</hi> Quakers <hi>Light can make when it acts the Part of

as Scoffing and Prophane; for they fling ſuch ſcurvy
Reflections upon <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> as become
not one who got his <hi>Oblivion</hi> by the <hi>former,</hi> and his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Liberty of Preaching and Licenſe for Printing</hi> by the
<hi>latter:</hi> For it is as much as to ſay, that both <hi>Cavaliers</hi>
and <hi>Prelates are a Sort of Revengeful, Angry and Fiery
Perſons</hi> (to be ſure bad enough, or he would not have
rendred me either, when he went about to character
me to Diſgrace) So <hi>unthankful</hi> is he for his Oblivion
and all other Benefits that he now enjoyes at the Hands,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:41053:211"/>
and by the Moderation of either Cavaliers, that is,
<hi>Royaliſts;</hi> or Prelates, that is, <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtants;</hi>
whom notwithſtanding, he pretended to be no further
concern'd in his Eſſayes againſt us, then vindicated, as I
have frequently obſerved.</p>
               <p>But laſtly he accepts againſt my mention of one of
his new <hi>Benefactors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Gentleman, Mr. <hi>T. F.</hi> againſt whom Mr.
<hi>Penn</hi> hath ſuch a Slpeen, that to my great Wonder I find
him in all his Writings (I have read) attempting his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
who never wrote againſt him; and if my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
fail me not, <hi>P.</hi> hath been engaged by him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Deportment.</p>
               <p>How black am I with <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Dirt? but none of
it will ſtick. <hi>Spleen</hi> I never had to the Man; but once
a Friendſhip, that had never been broken by me; but
as it came, it went. At the time of our Diſputation
with <hi>T. D. T. V. T. D.</hi> and <hi>W. M.</hi> at the <hi>Spitle,</hi>
being engaged in the Negative concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Doctrine of <hi>diſtinct and ſeparate Perſonallity,</hi>
he and ſome others fell into great Intimacy with us;
Who but we in his and their Thoughts? at what time
they were not quite diſcovered by us: But pulling off
their Masks, at laſt we found them to have been the
Followers of <hi>J. Biddle,</hi> in that which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Socinian</hi>-Way; and that their peculiar Regard
to us came from an implicite Vindication of one of
their Principles, for which we came under the Scandal
and Odium of <hi>Socinians:</hi> Pulpits rang how the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
had unmaskt themſelves on that Occaſion; and
their warm Diſputes in our Defence did not a little
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:41053:211"/>
ſtrengthen the common Reports that went of us, and
me in particular. When my Book intituled, <hi>The San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Foundation Shaken,</hi> came out, it being a further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of what we call Errors, and it happening that
<hi>Socinians</hi> did the ſame, as I was a rank <hi>Socinian</hi> (who
had never read any one <hi>Socinian</hi> Book in all my Life,
if lookt into one at that time) ſo theſe Men, at leaſt
<hi>T. F.</hi> was ready to believe me nearer a kin to them,
then, God he knows, I was; that is to ſay, <hi>in Denying the
Divinity of Chriſt.</hi> At this time, what would he not
have done for me, if I might have believed him, and
in Reallity the Man was wonderfully taken; but which
was grievous, he was ſhamefully miſtaken; and when
he came to read my Confeſſion to Chriſt's Eternal God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in my little Book, intituled, <hi>Innocency with her
Open Face</hi> (though he had another, called, <hi>The Guide
Miſtaken,</hi> that p. 28. abundantly doth the ſame, which
was writ and read by him before the <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi>

Friendſhip and Rules of Civility, and his extream ſhews
of Kindneſs turned to continual exceſſive Reflections;
He would have it a <hi>Retraction,</hi> rather then be thought
to have been miſtaken; He had built his Hopes too
high for the Foundation, and then became wrathful that
they fell. And though I ſought his friendly Behaviour,
having no Thought in my Heart but Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to him; yet ſo invincible was his Diſpleaſure,
that there was no holding for me of his Good-will, <hi>and
believing Chriſt to be God;</hi> They were with him as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent,
as Light and Darkneſs; I know no other
Reaſon (if this be any) for his Sharpneſs to me; And
God knows, this is the very Truth. I leave it with my

Matter.</p>
               <p>But <hi>he never wrote againſt me;</hi> Truly he needed not,
who hath another Inſtrument ſo nimble, and ſo able a
<hi>Scribe</hi> as <hi>J. F.</hi> for the Purpoſe. But if calling me the
baſeſt Names, undervaluing, detracting and traducing
me in almoſt all Companies behind my back; and in a
Garden at <hi>Hogfdon,</hi> where I went to accompany ſome
of my Relations, to affront me with opprobrious Names,
as many can witneſs, who demean'd my ſelf with all
Gentleneſs towards him; and to act in the Quallity of
an inceſſant Agent againſt us by Informations, Reports,
Books, &amp;c. (WHO ONCE DID ALL THESE
THINGS FOR US (and we are no worſe Men then
we were) If theſe things be no juſt Provocations to
mention two Letters, I am to blame: Yet that I name
him in almoſt all my Writings, or all that he hath read,
is falſe; for in the <hi>Spirit of Alexander the Copper-Smith,
&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>J. F.</hi> quotes, he is not named, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Twelve Books he was mention'd but in Three, and
that obſcurely; this makes the Fourth againſt my Will.
The Occaſion, beſides what hath been already toucht
upon, was this; <hi>H. H.</hi> one of his Friends, writes a
Book againſt us, or rather to us againſt <hi>G. F. J. Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>'s
Mr. <hi>T. F.</hi> was the Promoter and Scatterer of theſe
Pamphlets, eſpecially upon the Exchange, where (&amp; not
in private Converſe, as <hi>J. F.</hi> ſayes, and makes to be
the only Reaſon of my taking notice of him, that he
may render me baſe to his Readers) before ſeveral, and
thoſe of divers Perſwaſions, called G. Fox <hi>Knave, Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
Logerhead,</hi> with ſuch like unhandſome Terms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Man of <hi>T. F</hi>'s Conſideration in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:41053:212"/>
This I would never have repeated, had not <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
drawn, yea, compelled it from me, by ſuggeſting an
Untruth, and ſubſtituting it in the room of the True
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But if his Information fail him not, I have been
engaged by</hi> T. F. <hi>to another kind of Deportment.</hi> And
ſuppoſe all this, hath he not diſ-engaged me ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
I owe no Man any thing beyond Truth, nor will be
fettered from my Teſtimony by any Obligations. But
I never was engaged to him beyond what I have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
related, except it was his lending me (as he
thought) by one that was my Servant at that time of
my Tower-Impriſonment, about Forty Pounds (he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in my Name, counterfitting both Meſſages and
Letters, as I made appear to him afterwards) which,
though mine Eyes never ſaw one Penny of it, nor was
there a Penny employed in my Service, or to my uſe,
I did, when God enabled me, having then no Eſtate in
my Hands, faithfully repay, as if I had really had, every
Penny; believing then, and ſtill, that it was Kindneſs
in him to me that was abuſed by a Knaviſh Servant;
and I would never let him ſuffer for it: If herein I have
wronged him, he may forgive me.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in my Anſwer to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> and what he
ſaid in his behalf againſt us, I told him, that ſome
thought it a Shame, that <hi>ſo ill a Tongue ſhould go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
of thoſe whoſe Principles and Intereſt give them
the Liberty of doing it in a way that might be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
then all the Moderation and Reaſon that can eaſily
be ſhown to him;</hi> J. Faldo, exactly like himſelf, ſtrains
theſe words, <hi>all the Moderation and Reaſon,</hi> which I
intended, <hi>of our bearing his Abuſes, only ſhowing their
Vnreaſonableneſs by writing,</hi> to nothing below ſome
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:41053:213"/>
                  <hi>Vnjuſt and Violent Courſe to rid him out of the way;</hi>
which are but ſofter words for down-right <hi>Murder,</hi>
and to Countenance this Comment of his. I was told,
I think, by one that had it at <hi>T. F</hi>'s Mouth, <hi>that he
was adviſed to take the Law of me for his Security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to put all this out of doubt, thoſe that thought
it a Shame, he ſhould ſo frequently, violently and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
revile honeſt Men, bringing their Common Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
into Queſtion by ſcurvy Names, meant by the way
that might be taken, only the <hi>Law,</hi> which was what
ſome counſelled him to uſe to ſecure himſelf againſt me.
Theſe Men had need have good Conſciences, <hi>that are
thus affraid before they are hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I vindicated thoſe Reflections <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
lay'd ſuch Foundation for; and if <hi>T. F.</hi> be troubled
at this, I muſt tell him, ſo am I, but I cannot help it;
Let him better adviſe his Scribe next time; for I have
nothing but hearty Love and good Wiſhes for him;
nor have I ſaid any thing harſh or diſgraceful in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of my ſelf, imputing much of what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

               <p>His <hi>Epilogue</hi> degenerates not one jot from the Book

               </p>

               </q>
               <p>But why ſo much Contempt upon this Paſſage, unleſs
it be to ſhow us, that he can ſtill Scoff at that <hi>Principle
of Life,</hi> which is the Strength and Habitation of God's
Children, as he hath done already throughout both his

Chriſt's Meaning by their Reaſoning about it, <hi>John</hi> 6.
or would not either have reliſht the true Meaning of his
Words, had they dwelt in the Divine Principle of Life?
Why did Chriſt ſay; <hi>I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of
Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from
the Wiſe and Prudent, and revealed them unto Babes,</hi> if
they are diſcoverable by humane Reaſoning? for <hi>Babes</hi>

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:41053:214"/>

who ſaid, <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the
Scribe? Where is the Diſputer? &amp;c.</hi> for this implies an
Excluſion of all thoſe Arts, Sciences and Natural Gifts
from any Capacity to reveal the deep Things of God,
ſhut up in the Divine Principle of Life. Beſides <hi>W. S</hi>'s
Words imply a <hi>Clouded</hi> Underſtanding and <hi>degenerated,</hi>
and therefore Uncapable. <hi>J. F.</hi> muſt either intend by
his <hi>Deriſion</hi> that he thinks <hi>W. S.</hi> deſerves to be hiſs'd
for denying the Knowledge of Divine Things to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,
by the Degenerated Underſtanding of Man,
or ſanctified: If the firſt, All may have Cauſe to abhor
his Falſe Doctrine: If the latter, I would know which
way that can be, without the Divine Principle of Life?
This abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts

to be ignorant of the

When the Natural Man

Chriſt, he may know his

and the Power of God, and not before; but becauſe
it is impoſſible in Reaſoning or Arguing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> by

to know Chriſt, but by the Revelation of the Spirit of
God alone, as hath been abundantly proved; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>Theſe, <hi>Reader,</hi> are but ſome Hints I was willing
to give thee of our Adverſary's Diſingenuous Carriage
towards us, either in letting drop that which may be
moſt material, at leaſt might be more explanatory of
our Friends Intentions, foiſting in words wholely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Scope of our Paſſages, or miſ-apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in favour of his black Charges, all which may
clearly be ſeen by a Compariſon of his Books with our
Friends Writings, a great part of which, I muſt confeſs,
it will be difficult to procure, ſince to prove his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
in Citations, I have not been able to compaſs
above the one half of the Books he names; but that
carries this Woful Reflection with it, if his uſe of 15.
Books in Thirty affords us ſo many groſs Inſtances of
his Unfair Dealing with us, what might we have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon our Examination of the reſt? In the mean
time we ſhall without leave ſuſpect him, having ſo
much Reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>To compleat what I have done in this Particular, let
me tell thee, Reader, that in his Compariſon of us with
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he ſets down Twenty ſeveral Paſſages as our
Doctrines and Opinions, <hi>not producing
ſo much as one Perſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Book 1. Part 1. pag. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</note> 
                     <hi>Book or Page to
avouch them;</hi> a piece of Juſtice he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
not to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves at
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:41053:222"/>
what time he refuſeth it to us, though not they, but
we were the People againſt whom the Diſcourſe was
writ: which, though groſs enough, yet nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with his Diſingenuity at the end of his Firſt
Book,<note place="margin">Part 3. from p. 62. to 90.</note> where under the Pretence of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
his Reader with a <hi>Key</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meanings by, he ſets
down no leſs then about two Hundred and Fifty Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in our Name, <hi>without ſo much as the bare mention of
one Author, Book or Page, to countenance his Attempt.</hi>
Yet after all this he cannot bear to be told of his unfair
Carriage, and his Unjuſt Dealing towards us; His
Quality, or his Pride, is ſo great, it will not bear a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion;
I never met with a Man of ſo much Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Stomach together. He thinks it ſo great a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to be told of his Miſcarriages, that if we will
not let him paſs for <hi>a Faithful, Sober, Meek and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Author,</hi> however he hath proved himſelf the
Contrary, <hi>we muſt expect all that his Scorn and Anger
can caſt upon us:</hi> But ſuch Vindications of his <hi>Eſſayes</hi>
will be Hand-writing enough againſt themſelves, and
their Author, who ought not to flatter himſelf after
theſe great Evils, with the Hopes of Impunity; <hi>for ſuch
as he hath ſown againſt us, ſuch ſhall he reap at the Hand
of God, the Righteous Judge of all, who will reward eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man according to his Works.</hi> But I deſire with all
my Soul that God may ſhow him Mercy, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
may yet over-take him, and this Iniquity be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out before he departs this World, and is no more
ſeen I would beſeech him in the Love of God to fight
no longer againſt the Truth, and for a Cauſe, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(might it ſpeak) would tell him, is not the only
true God's, <hi>but the Honour and Intereſt of the God of
this World,</hi> whom the formal <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is lead and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:41053:222"/>
by, that is ſo ſharp againſt us. Let him not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to take Shame for that which is ſhameful, leſt vain
Credit here, brings Sorrow hereafter. I cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
perſwaded, but that <hi>Reputation</hi> prevailed more
with him then <hi>Conſcience</hi> in this Controverſie; he tugs
ſo hard to prop the one, and there is ſo little ſavour of
the other: God could never be in that Deſign, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
thoſe Thoughts, that were laid with ſo great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
and which have been vented with ſo much Fury.
I muſt needs ſay, There was neither Truth to inform us,
nor Charity to gain us: It ſtumbled the Weak, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Tender &amp; offended the Peaceable among thoſe
Profeſſions he pretended to vindicate, gratifying only
ſuch as are of a <hi>Litigious</hi> and <hi>Contentious</hi> Nature, whoſe
unreaſonable Heat it had been his Duty rather to abate
by Sweet Perſwaſion and a meek Example. <hi>I have this
Comfort in my Concluſion of this Controverſie, that I
moſt heartily forgive him all the Injuſtice and Vnkindneſs
he hath ſhown, at leaſt ſo far as I am therein concerned,
and that I think is more then any Man; And with the
ſame Love that God hath loved me, I do with all my Soul
fervently wiſh his Solid &amp; Vnfeigned Repentance, that he
may receive the Love and Mercies of God in the Remiſſion
of his Sins, and Reconciliation of him by the Power and
Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, that he may kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THus, <hi>Friendly Reader,</hi> are we come to the End of
our Task, wherein, I hope, the Doctrines of that
deſpiſed People, in Deriſion called <hi>Quakers,</hi> their
Worſhip and Church-Practice, are evidently and firmly
vindicated againſt vulgar Miſtakes and Reports, and
more eſpecially thoſe many black Charges, ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exhibited by <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> in his firſt &amp; ſecond Books, both
by a fair Reſcue of our Words from his groſs Perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and indirect and unnatural Meanings, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our real Senſe, with plenty of plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
many Reaſons, and the unqueſtionable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of ſeveral Ancient and Modern conſiderable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
My Deſign hath not been Conqueſt, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that by theſe Religious Wars we may at laſt
arrive at Peace; And theſe Weapons be all beaten into
Plow-ſhares, ſo as to learn War no more: That to fear
God and work Righteouſneſs (the Life of Jeſus Chriſt
our Lord, who hath left us his moſt Holy Example,
that we ſhould follow his ſteps) may be the very bent
of our Hearts, the Reſolution of our Minds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Practice of our Lives, which bring the Soul to the
Inheritance of Subſtance, &amp; eſtabliſh the Heart forever.</p>
               <p>Oh, that all who read this Diſcourſe, may with me
wind up their Spirits, and lodge their Souls, not in
the Love of Controverſie, but of that Divine Life,
which ſtills, reſolves, and fixes all, and gives ſuch Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Waiters to feel and enjoy Immortallity! To ſee
and poſſeſs ſomething that is beyond time, &amp; theſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
