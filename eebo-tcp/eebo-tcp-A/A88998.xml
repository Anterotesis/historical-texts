         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>Sir <hi>William
Killagrew</hi> hath miſ-ſtated the matter of
Fact in his Printed Caſe, for therein
he alleadges that the Commiſſioners firſt invited the King
to recommend to them an Undertaker; whereas it appears
otherwiſe in the Kings Letters, and in three of his Letters
the King varies. The Undertakers, which no queſtion was
by Sir <hi>Robert Killagrew,</hi> Sir <hi>William Killagrew,</hi> and Maſter
<hi>Robert Longs</hi> procurement. The Kings firſt Letter is moſt
obſervable, therein are couched all the fallacies of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers,
and the foundation of the project: They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and perſwaded the King, that he might appoint
and command a Tax to be laid of a Marke the Acre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reſpect to the intereſt of particular perſons, or
conſult the owners: And further, That the Tax ſhould be
made by the Commiſſioners on you, without Verdict; and
that their judgement muſt be the rule of proceedings in
this caſe, and not the conſent of the Owners, whoſe
averſeneſſe muſt not prejudice the Publique good. In the
Kings ſecond Letter, the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> Sir <hi>Rob. Killagrew,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118263:3"/>
Sir <hi>William Killagrew,</hi> are recommended by way of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi>
to be Undertakers, <hi>As we expect, and we do command
all manner of perſons to forbeare to make any particular bargains
or works, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third Letter it is ſtill by way of <hi>Mandamus, We
have made choice of him</hi> (meaning the Earle of <hi>Lindſey) to be
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker.</hi> And in the Kings laſt Letter, the King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to give his Royall Aſſent. The Commiſſioners began
legally, for they impannel'd a Jury of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
of twenty five, who found that the Levell was not
hurtfully ſurrounded. When Mr. <hi>Robert Long</hi> ſaw how the
Countrey was bent, he wiſely ſold his ſhare for <hi>1500l.</hi> to
Mr. <hi>Herne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicholas Love,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Hoyden,</hi> and
they were to be at the charge of draining. Likewiſe Mr.
<hi>Long</hi> perſwaded Mr. <hi>Thomas Killagrew,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> to
ſell their ſhares, but Sir <hi>William Killagrew</hi> would not be
adviſed, but built a faire Houſe on another folks Lands,
and fortified it, and furniſhed it with men, Ammunition,
and Artillery.</p>
               <p>Muskets, Horſemen, and Piſtols, in a Warlike manner,
and entertained French and Dutch.</p>
               <p>Yet the Countrey would never yeeld poſſeſſion, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
oppoſed Sir <hi>William,</hi> and the reſt of the Undertakers,
the Countrymen were Purſuivanted, impriſoned by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-Table-Warrants;
ſome we heare were wounded and
affrighted with Maſtiffe-Dogs.</p>
               <p>Many men were utterly undone and wearied out, and
forced to ſubſcribe and enter into Bonds.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the Courtiers ſaw the Commiſſioners joyned
with the Countrey, they procured worthy Patriots to be
put out of Commiſſion, and Courtiers, Servants to the
Undertakers, and many of themſelves were Jndges and
Parties; After the Jury found the Levell not hurtfully ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
they were laid aſide.</p>
               <p>And the Commiſſioners, many being Undertakers (and
conſequently Judges and Parties) got upon <hi>Boſton</hi> Steeple,
and adjudged all they ſaw was hurtfully ſurrounded. They
might, as well have got upon <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple, and adjudged
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118263:3"/>
all the rich Meadows and Marſhes on both ſides the <hi>Thames</hi>
to be hurtfully ſurrounded, when they are overflowne by
Land-floods.</p>
               <p>If you will ſee to the end, you muſt obſerve the meanes,
The Undertakers gave the King 3000. Acres by way of
bribe; and the King gave them 14000. Acres, for being
Judges and Parties; they might be their own carvers.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Undertakers gave ſome thouſands of Acres
to divers Lords of the Councell, and both the Secretaries.</p>
               <p>I pray Obſerve ſome materiall circumſtances: Firſt the
time when this project was ſet on foot.</p>
               <p>It was in the Intervals of Parliaments, the onely harveſt
for Projectors, then Parliaments were damn'd at Court.
And obſerve the perſons that were the Patrons of thoſe
Projectors; they were inveterate enemies to Parliaments.
The Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton,</hi> who was accuſed by Sir <hi>John
Elliot</hi> in 3 <hi>Car.</hi> and moſt inſtrumentall to impriſon thoſe
worthy Members, and Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> died a Martyr for the
Parliament in the Tower: The Earle of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> father
and ſon, and all the Undertakers, have been againſt the
Parliament. Alas there is a bed-roule of other grievances,
and 200. witneſſes were examined when Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> had the
chaire. So much in brief to the matter of Fact.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>For the Matter of Law, we conceive theſe Undertakers
are higher offenders then the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> for they
have not onely indeavoured, but traiterouſly, maliciouſly,
and premeditately, againſt the light of their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and knowledges, have actually ſubverted the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Lawes of the Land, and introduced an Arbitrary
and Tirannicall Government: For contrary to the 29.
<hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (which is confirmed by thirty two
Seſſions of Parliament, whereof the Petition of Right, and
the Act for the aboliſhing the Star-chamber are two; they
have impriſoned our perſons, and deſtroyed Juries, and
put out the two eyes of the Law, Liberty, and Property.
Likewiſe contrary to the 15 and 16 <hi>chap.</hi> of the great <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
wherein it is expreſſed, That no man ſhall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and diſtrained to make new ban<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<hi>H.</hi> 6. chap. 2. the 12. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. ch. 7. the 6. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. chap. 10.
All which are knit up in the 23. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. chap. the 5. yet
the Undertakers, many being Commiſſioners, have acted
point blank againſt theſe known Laws.</p>
               <p>For the Commiſſioners could do nothing without the
Jury, which are Judges of the matter of Fact, and they
are to finde the defaulters according to the 12. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.
and the 23. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and to amerce individuals, and not a
generall levell; and the Commiſſioners are to approve of
ſuch Amerciaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay they the undertakers, by the 23. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
the Commiſſioners may proceed without Juries by view,
according to their diſcretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> explains diſcretion, which is
<hi>Secundum conſuetudines &amp; leges Angliae,</hi> otherwiſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are irrationall and illegall; Beſides the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
could not lay a Tax, becauſe they were new
moulded of Courtiers which were Judges and Parties, and
the Countrey Gentlemen contrary to Uſance, Cuſtom, and
Law, were put out and Strangers put in, ſome not worth
fourty Marks <hi>per Annum,</hi> which by the Law they ought
to have been; ſo they were not legall Commiſſioners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were Undertakers, and conſequently Judges
and Parties, and could not contract with themſelves:
Had they been legall Commiſſioners they could not do it
without Juries, and they laid it likewiſe upon no body,
for generals ſignifies nothing, but as I ſaid formerly, it
muſt be done by the Jury upon individuals. All the Kings
Letters, which are ſuppoſed to be indited by Maſter <hi>Role <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Long,</hi> were diametrially contrary to Law; The King
could lay no Tax, nor give the Commiſſioners leave to
proceed without Juries, nor to appoint Undertakers,
which is contrary to the 43. of <hi>Eliz</hi> and the 4. and 7. of
King <hi>Iames:</hi> In the 43. of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> there is the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Undertaker, and therein he is limited and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
what, how, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d with whom he muſt contract: A
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118263:4"/>
Commiſſioner likewiſe hath no authority to contract, but
the Contract muſt be by the direction and approbation of
the Lords, Owners, and Commoners, under their hands
and ſeals in writing indented: Here was no ſuch matter,
they followed their own lights, which were <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi>
and ſo fell into thoſe pits they digged for others.</p>
               <p>They made a Contract with the King, which was an
evil bargain, and they had the Kings Royall Aſſent, which
ſignifies nothing out of Parliament, who ought by Law
to ſpeak onely by his Writs; For <hi>Det Lex Regi quod Rex
Legi, quae Rex jure poteſt, Rex ea ſola poteſt;</hi> but my fellow
Courtiers, thought they were above and beyond the Arm
of the Law, though they were both reached and over-reached
at the laſt.</p>
               <p>The Judges for Ship money were accuſed for Treaſon,
by reaſon it was deſtructive to Propriety, yet that was not
three in the pound; but the Fenne-Project cuts our eſtates
aſunder at a blow.</p>
               <p>In Ship-Money the King had a Judgement by the ſworn,
or rather forſworn Judges, but the Undertakers were the
old Levelling Courtiers, deſtroyers of Propriety, and got
the Kings hand to Letters of their own inditing; and juſt
as the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> produced blanks for all his horrid
illegall Acts, as diſarming the Proteſtants and arming the
Papiſts, ſo did the Undertakers produce the Kings Letters
upon all occaſions, eſpecially to deſtroy Jucies, and to
take away our reall eſtates, without conſulting the
Owners.</p>
               <p>It is the ſame with the Forreſt buſineſs, for the Judges
ſome of them would have made all <hi>England</hi> a Forreſt; So
this generation of Undertakers would have incorporated,
and got a ſtanding Commiſſion in all Counties, and ſo
made <hi>England</hi> the Levell, and <hi>England</hi> to be ſurrounded,
and in ſhort time would have taken all we had; This was

their title, ſo that we hope now we have gained that Poſt

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it was illegall in many reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt the Commiſſioners were illegall that laid it on the
Countrey, for the Nobility and Gentry were put out of
Commiſſion, and there was a new Commiſſion where the
Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Killagrew,</hi> Sir <hi>William Killagrew,</hi>
Maſter <hi>Robert Long,</hi> and divers Privie Counſellors who

to uſance, preſcription and cuſtom, which is the
Law of the Land; and many of them had not a foot of

fourty Marks <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the Commiſſioners been legall they could not lay

been legall they could neither lay a Tax to make new
works, which is cleared by the 15. and 16. Chap. of the
Great Charter: Likewiſe neither the Kings Commiſſioners
nor Jurors have any thing to do with the matter of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
that belongs onely to the major part of Lords,
Owners and Commoners; For they may Contract under

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quaere.</hi> Whether is not dreyning good for the Common
wealth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two kindes of dreyning, the one is
by the Ancient Commiſsions of Sewers.</p>
               <p>The other by the more recent way of Undertaking;
both theſe are legall and illegall.</p>
               <p>Legall dreyning (<hi>viz.</hi>) by Commiſſioners of Sewers
of the Nobility, and wel-affected Gentry of their own
Country, and honeſt goodmen of the Neighbourhood,
who are to be Jurors, and conſequently Judges of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, who return Defaultors according to the 12. of
<hi>Edw.</hi> the 4. and thereupon, the Commiſſioners confirm
their Amerciaments: were the old dreyns thus legally
ſcowred twice or thrice the year, there would little Land
lye hurtfully ſurrounded, this is good for the Common-wealth.
But illegall dreyning, that is, to put in Courtiers,
ſharers, ſharks and ſtrangers to be Commiſſioners, and by
the Kings Prerogative to make them Judges and Parties,
and to impower them to take away the Free Peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
againſt their conſents by view onely, without Juries,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118263:7"/>
and to make new Works for private ends, contrary to the
great Charter, which is confirmed by 32 Seſſions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
This is deſtructive to Propriety, and the bane of
the Common-wealth: Undertaking is a diſtinct thing
from the Commiſſions of Sewers, neither has the Kings
Commiſſioners of Sewers nor Jurors any thing to do with
the matter or manner of undertaking: This is likewiſe
two fold, legall or illegall; Legall undertaking, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> is when the major part of the Lords, Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Commoners, do agree with any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or Corporations, for a certain ſum of money under
their hands and Seales, for the draining ſuch Lands as they
finde hurtfully ſurrounded. This is good for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
becauſe it is with their free conſents, ſo <q>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti
non ſit injuria.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Illegall undertaking is when the Kings Commiſſioners
of Sewers, or others by vertue of the Kings Authority, by
violence, oppreſſion, or Councell-Table-Warrants, will
Act as Undertakers againſt the Owners conſents; this is
the heighth of Arbitrary Government, and Tiranny it

hurt, it may be good for the Common-wealth; but if
they do more hurt then good, it muſt of neceſſity be bad
for the Common-wealth. The Undertaker is like the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
he ſtops one hole, and makes two; he draynes one
Acre for himſelf, and drownes two of his neighbours; nay
ſometimes twenty: certainly this is bad for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>Yet he hath drained Lands hurtfully ſurrounded, and
drowned Lands not hurtfully ſurrounded, and muſt have
a third part of thoſe Lands that were never hurtfully
drowned for Melioration, ſo the ſame former diſtinction
ſtill holds good, Legall is good, illegall is bad for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>

hurtfully ſurrounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two Verdicts, and fourty Witneſſes,
that have proved it is not hurtfully ſurrounded; But if
draining Lands hurtfully ſurrounded were good, then
draining Lands not hurtfully ſurrounded certainly is bad
for the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>For to draine dry Land, it is to take away the <hi>Humidum
Radicale,</hi> and ſo conſequently to ſpoile it: Beſides to drain
the Lands floods from our fodder-Fens, and to divert the
Rivers from overflowing, we ſhould not have half ſo much
Fodder for our Cattell in winter.</p>
               <p>This Levell is of this condition in both reſpects, and
the Earles new Draines do much more hurt then good, by
draining dry grounds, which the Undertakers keep for
themſelves, and leaves the worſt to the Country, and ſo
contrives their new Draines, that they hurtfully ſurround
thoſe Lands which were not hurtfully ſurrounded before;
ſo they drown us to drain us, but the remedy is worſe then
the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>There are ſeverall Witneſſes that have proved this, and
we can demonſtrate it mathematically.</p>
               <p>That by opening the old Draines, it would be far more
beneficiall to the Commonwealth, and it would not ſtand
the Country in the tenth part of the charge: All which
can and will be done by a legall Commiſſion of Sewers,
of the well-affected Gentry of the Countrey, and honeſt
Jurors of the Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Quaere.</hi> Why hath not the Countrey drained themſelves all

their ſelves good, nor ſuffer others to help them?</p>

they have been obſtructed theſe ſixty yeares by powerfull
Courtiers, as Lord Keepers, Attorneys-Generall, and the
diſſolution and Intervals of Parliaments have impeded us;
but when we are rid of the Undertakers, the worke will
quickly be done, both for the Honour and profit of the
Nation, without fraud or coven.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is <hi>Ala Mountebanco,</hi> or <hi>Sharlaton</hi> like: Our Fens as
they are, produce great ſtore of Wooll and Lambe, and
large fat Mutton, beſides infinite quantities of Butter and
Cheeſe, and do breed great ſtore of Cattell, and are ſtockt
with Horſes, Mares, and Colts, and we ſend fat Beefe to
the Markets, which affords Hides and Tallow, and for
Corne, the Fodder we mow off the Fens in ſummer, feeds
our Cattell in the winter: By which meanes wee gather
ſuch quantities of Dung, that it inriches our upland, and
Corne-ground, (which are contiguous halfe in halfe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
our Fennes relieves our neighbours, the Uplanders,
in a dry ſummer, and many adjacent Counties: So thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Cattell beſides our owne are preſerved, which
otherwiſe would periſh. So take away a third of our Fens,
you extinguiſh our Rents in our Commoning Houſes, and
our Paſtures, and Corne-ground, proportionably; beſides
thouſands of Cottagers which have no right of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
muſt go a begging, which the Owners connive at,
becauſe they cannot prevent it, being ſo numerous. So
that Rape, Cole-ſeed, and Hemp, is a Dutch Commodity,
and but traſh and trumpery, and pils Land in reſpect of
the afore recited Commodities, which are the Oare of the

               <p n="8">8 <hi>Quaere.</hi> Is it not pitty, when Sir <hi>William Killagrew</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118263:8"/>
but that the Countrey ſhould re-imburſe his moneys, there is all the

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it hath been proved, he hath done a great
deale more hurt then good by his new Dreyners, and when
the Countrey ſhall make uſe of the Undertakers Dreynes,
we will give ſatisfaction for them, but they are uſeleſſe,
nay pernicious and broken Ciſternes to the Commoners in
Summer, both by dreyning our dry grounds, ſo we are
conſtreyned to buy water, and to drive our Cattell very
far in Summer to water them; whereas our old Dreynes
have ever furniſhed us with water enough. Then on the
other extreame, their new Works have ſo hurtfully ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
us, that our Upland and Corne-grounds have
been ſpoyled by them; this is fully proved by many unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
Witneſſes, the Countrey is daminified at the leaſt
60000 l. by theſe Undertakers.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Quaere.</hi> Whether are the old Draynes or the new, moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for dreyning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The old Dreynes are as the naturall ſinks, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vent of the Body of the Fens; Suppoſe a mans fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament
were ſtopped, and that a hundred Iſſues were made
in the body, the whole maſſe of blood would quickly be
corrupted, and the body would breake out in botches and
biles.</p>
               <p>So ſtop the old Sewers, you will quickly perceive the
ſores or Quagmires will increaſe; and whereas there is
but one Acre now hurtfully ſurrounded were the old
Draines duly ſcowred, if they be ſtopped there will be
tenne.</p>
               <p>This is proved by Maſter <hi>Thorpe</hi> Mathematician, and he
gives his reaſon, which is Mathematicall and neceſſary.
Becauſe the old Dreynes have farre greater deſcents then
the new, ſo that the old Dreynes were never without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in ſummer, which now they want exceedingly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of theſe Undertakers Dreynes; which was proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Maſter <hi>Ellis,</hi> when he had the Chaire, by twenty

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118263:9"/>
Likewiſe the new Dreynes, wanting that deſcent the
old had, the leaſt floods in Summer or Winter overflow
thoſe Lands ſooner and longer, which is the cauſe that
theſe Fennes are ten times more hurtfully ſurrounded then
before. This is not my bare information, but Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,
or neceſſary, and proved by many Witneſſes:
For I ſay what Maſter <hi>Walpoole</hi> hath alleadged is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall
at all, but pragmaticall and fantaſticall.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange Chymaera and Phrenzie in the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
to expect ſatisfaction of the Parliament for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

the old Ship-money Judges ſhould be preferred to be Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and that their Fines ſhould be reſtored, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
over and above, and the preſent Reverend Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

               <p>We hope the Parliament will either Fine them, as they

and all the fundamentall Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>And againſt twenty of the Parliaments Declarations,
which are in Print to the view of all the world; yet the
Undertakers are ſo impudent that they are confident to
paſs a Law, and to inſlave us, who have conquered them;
but we ſo Confide in our Truſtees, that we know it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible,
being contrary to the principles of a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
who acknowledge the Supream Power reſides in the
People, and the Supream Authority is derived from them,
and the Soul and heart of the Common-wealth is <hi>Liberty</hi>
and <hi>Property.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Undertakers were formidable Monſters to the
Countrey, and had they continued a little longer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
they would not only have torn in pieces, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and ſwallowed up the whole Nation; For they
were Legiſlators out of Parliament, and Anti-Legiſlators,
Parliamentarians, and Anti-Parliamentarians, Bribers,
Judges, Juries and Parties. They were Legiſlators, for
they have made ſeverall Laws, and they bribed the King
with 3000. Acres to purchaſe his Royall Aſſent, though I
believe they might have had it for nothing. This was the
Root of all our Miſeries; For could the Parliament by
their humble Petitions have obtained the Kings Royall
Aſſent, as theſe Courtiers could do with eaſe by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
opportunity and flattery, this War had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
been prevented: Certainly the Undertakers were
the onely Impeders and partition walls betwixt King and
People; and they had cloſed and been reconciled, had it
not been for ſuch Impoſters as they, who cared not for
God, King, nor Countrey, but ſought themſelves and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118263:10"/>
their owne gaine before the Publique.</p>
               <p>That Prince is unhappy that prefers Perſons or Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,
before the Repreſentative of ſo numerous a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and great Nation. They were Anti-Legiſlators, for
all their Laws were point blank againſt the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Petition of Right, and all the Fundamentall Laws
of the Land; they were Parliamentarians to call a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to ſell Ship-money for twelve Subſidies, and to
raiſe money to make Wars againſt the Scots, who wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for their Liberties, and were not ſuch tame ſlaves, as
they expected: When the Parliament would give no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
to inſlave themſelves, then the Courtiers diſſolved
that Parliament. That the Undertakers were Bribers is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Record, and likewiſe that they were Judges, Juries,
and Parties: Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> was wont to ſay, that it
never failed, that thoſe which brake Parliaments were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
broken by them; yet theſe Undertakers hope to be
repayred for their project, which was onely to keep off
Parliaments; And this one Project (had it ſucceeded)
would have commanded all the Land in <hi>England</hi> to have
been at the Kings diſpoſing; Then all had been their own;
for the King was little the better by ſuch Projects, the
Courtiers gained all.</p>
