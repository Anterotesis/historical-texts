            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A wonderful Inſtance of God's <hi>Appearance</hi>
for, and <hi>Preſence</hi> with his People, in a
<hi>Day of Suffering,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Deſire which you have, Dear Sir, to know what manner
of Perſon Mr. <hi>Rey</hi> was, and the manner of his Death in <hi>France,</hi>
is a reaſonable Paſſion, which I cannot refuſe to ſatisfy. He
whom you deſire to know, is worthy to be known by the whole
World; and his Death, which you would be enform'd about, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to be known by all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He was a <hi>Propoſant</hi> (or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate
of the Miniſtry.) a Native of <hi>Nimes,</hi> Twenty four Years old;
of whom, before he was born, 'twas known what ſhould be his
Lot after he was born. Whilſt his Mother carried him in her
Womb, ſhe dreamed a Dream, wherein it was revealed to her what
ſhould be the Life, and what ſhould be the Death of her Son. She
ſaw in her dream an Eagle that flew near her, and that ſtopt at the
Foot of her Bed, carrying two Feathers in his Bill; and ſhe had
no ſooner ſeen this Object but ſhe heard a Voice, that ſaid to her,
<hi>Behold, one of theſe two Feathers which this Eagle carries in his Bill,
ſignifies that the Child which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall preach the Goſpel;
and the other Feather is to ſignify to thee, that this Infant ſhall ſeal the
Goſpel which he ſhall preach, with his Blood.</hi> Though this Mother of
his was of the number of thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that do not ſcrupulouſly
mind Dreams, and though ſhe knew that God doth no longer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
himſelf to Men in this manner of Revelation; yet ſhe was ſo
ſtruck with what ſhe had dream'd, that ſhe could not forbear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
it to her Husband.</p>
            <p>They both found the Dream was very Important, by the two
Feathers of the Eagle, pluck'd from their natural place, and by the
Voice, which told what they repreſented: The one of them ſeeming
to them to mean, that the Son that was to be born, ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from them of whom he ſhould be born, and that he ſhould
have the ſwiftneſs of an Eagle in carrying the Goſpel thither where
he was to preach it; and the other Feather ſeeming to them to ſignify
that this Son ſhould be pluck'd out of the World, in ſealing with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66531:3"/>
his own Blood the Goſpel which he ſhould Publiſh. After theſe
Reflections they both concluded, that it was requiſite to write
down the Dream in a Regiſter, wherein the Father wrote down
every conſiderable thing that paſſed in his Family. And they did
it that they might the better remember it in all its Circumſtances,
and to ſee in proceſs of time, whether it would be accompliſh'd in
its parts.</p>
            <p>The thing was done before the Child was born; and he was no
ſooner born, but the Father and Mother, remembring the Dream,
and what they had wrote down concerning it, deſign'd to bread
up this Child in Learning; and according to that Deſign which
they had form'd, they cauſed him to ſtudy in his Childhood. This
Child have made a Progreſs in his Studies, in that of the Tongues,
and that of Philoſophy, he entred on the Study of Divinity; in
which having made a great Proſiciency in a few Years, after ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Trials of his Underſtanding and his Gifts in divers probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
Sermons, and many Prayers; in which he ſhew'd an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Zeal, enough to warm the coldeſt Hearts, and to animate
the moſt languiſhing ones, he reſolved to preſent himſelf to the
Synod of his Province, that he might be employed in the work
of the Miniſtry, to which he had been deſign'd, and for which the
Lord had prepar'd him. But he was hindred from ſo doing by the
Perſecution which was there raiſed up againſt our Churches: For
then there was no longer any liberty of aſſembling themſelves in a
Synod; and the Perſecution continually encreaſing, and ſpreading
it ſelf every day like a Torrent, the Temples were demoliſhed,
Exerciſes forbidden, all the Paſtors baniſh'd, and the Edicts
of <hi>Chriſtian Liberties</hi> aboliſhed. However all this could not beat
him off; God and his Conſcience ſupplying the want of the Synod;
call'd him to the Functions of the Miniſtry; he followed this Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
and his Reſolution was in the following it not to quit <hi>France,</hi>
when all the Paſtors departed whom the King had baniſhed thence.
He formed a deſign to tarry there to preach the Goſpel to thoſe that
knew him, and had made a Profeſſion of it, that he might confirm
thoſe among them that ſtood in the midſt of the great Efforts of
the Perſecution, and to raiſe up thoſe that were fallen through the
Violence of Temptation. In purſuit of this Deſign he went to
<hi>Montauban,</hi> believing that there would be a great Harveſt; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found the City wholly given to Idolatry, after St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>He was greatly troubled in Spirit, and ſhook off the Dust of
his Feet againſt them.</hi> Thence he went to <hi>Milhau</hi> in <hi>Rovergne;</hi> but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66531:3"/>
ſeeing that City had followed the Example of that of <hi>Montauban,</hi>
he went thence to go to St. <hi>Affrique,</hi> where he had ſome Kindred,
among whom he hoped to find ſome place of Refuge; which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to go and ſeek out a certain Perſon at <hi>Pont de Camares,</hi>
where he ſtay'd a few Days, but whence he was forced ſpeedily to
depart for want of Hearers, and by thoſe Straits to which he was
reduced. Having departed from this place, he knew not whither
to go, nor where to lay his Head. He found there were Snares
every where; and we need not doubt but then, not knowing what
to do, he lifted up his Eyes to God, and made this Prayer to him.</p>
            <q>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 142.</note>
               <l>Though with ſharp Griefs my Soul ſurrounded be,</l>
               <l>Thou know'ſt how from thoſe Straits to ſet me free.</l>
            </q>
            <p>It was the Prayer that <hi>David</hi> made when he was reduced to a
care, purſued by the rage of <hi>Saul;</hi> and which a Holy Man of our
Age made, contending for the intereſt of our Religion, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf environed on all ſides with Enemies that purſued him,
not knowing where to meet with a place of refuge.</p>
            <p>This faithful imitator of the Fidelity of the Prophet, and of
the reſignation of this Confeſſor of Jeſus Chriſt, being reduced to
their condition, did not want the ſame Diſpoſitions; he left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
like them, to the Providence of <hi>God,</hi> being aſſured that that
would open ſome paſſage for him, and direct him to find ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
place. Providence immediately anſwered his Deſire and
his Hope; for preſently it conducted him to Two Gentlemen, who
having underſtood the occaſion of his motions, promiſed him all
their help to defend his perſon, and to furniſh him with neceſſaries
for his ſubſiſtence. Theſe Gentlemen were Two <hi>Reformed Chriſtians</hi>
that had been brought into Tribulation, and who ran from one
place to another, that they might not be caught in thoſe ſnares
which the Perſecution laid for them. They ſought after ſuch a
Comforter as this, to help them to endure that War wherein they
found themſelves engaged. They joined themſelves to him, that
they might receive advantage by his Inſtructions, and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and accompany him every where whither he ſhould go, that
they might hear them. They followed him into many Houſes in
the Country, and into the Woods, where amidſt the barrenneſs of
Trees and Rocks, <hi>God</hi> found out ſome Harveſt for him to employ
himſelf about. There were many Aſſemblies held; there he made
many Diſcourſes, and Prayed often; being always in action both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66531:4"/>
Day and Night to ſtrengthen his Brethren. After he had there
ſtrengthned the hearts of many, being deſirous to know in what
condition Monſieur his Father was, rather with reſpect to his Soul
than his Body, he ſet forward towards <hi>Nimes;</hi> and paſſing through
<hi>Montpellier,</hi> he there found ſome Miniſters that were come thither
to demand a Paſs-Port of Monſieur the Intendant; and with whom
he had ſeveral Conferences to oblige them to tarry in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which the King commanded them to quit; aſſuring them,
That whatever Prohibitions there might be to tarry and Preach
there, yet he would tarry there and Preach, that he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his duty according to his Calling.</p>
            <p>The deſire he had to ſee his own Country did not permit him to
make any long ſtay at <hi>Montpellier.</hi> He was at <hi>Nimes</hi> where he did
all that the duty of a Son, that of a Chriſtian, and that of a Paſtor
could require of him. Thence he went to carry the Word to a
place near to <hi>Nimes;</hi> where Aſſemblies were held many times, and
where he ſpoke and prayed always with abundance of Zeal and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
without fearing in the leaſt the Ambuſhes that were laid for
him, and the Dangers wherewith he was threatned. But the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the Name of Chriſt, and thoſe that defend his intereſts,
there raiſed up ſuch ſtrong Tempeſts, that they could no longer
Aſſemble themſelves there. He ſeparated and ſcattered thoſe, of
which that Aſſembly was uſually compoſed; divers were made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
of which ſome were condemned to the Galleys, and the
others after a hard Impriſonment were enlarged, their Enemies not
finding witneſſes that would depoſe againſt them. In the time of
theſe Seizings and Impriſonments Monſieur <hi>Rey</hi> was accuſed by one
that profeſſed Friendſhip to him, his Name was <hi>Andoyer,</hi> but who
was treacherous to him after he had been ſo to <hi>God.</hi> He accuſed
him to Juſtice, which uſed mighty endeavours to take and deſtroy
him. But he eſcaped his Hands and his Sword, flying from the
Perſecution. This flight brought him as far as <hi>Caſtres,</hi> where he
continued his Employment, in inſtructing his Brethren, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to ſuffer all things for the cauſe of <hi>God,</hi> which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and fortifying them to maintain all the Battles to which
they were called forth for this holy Cauſe. His Inſtructions, his
Exhortations and his Prayers there, had ſome effect on ſome good
Souls, who have ſince made it appear. The ſtorm of the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
having been raiſed up there alſo as ſtrongly againſt him as
elſewhere, removed him again towards <hi>Nimes,</hi> where he remained
ſometime; during which all his Care was to write many Letters
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66531:4"/>
to divers Priſoners that ſuffered in the Priſons, not for being Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
or Thieves, but only Faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
never to renounce his Truth, nor leave off his Livery. He
exhorted them by his Letters to ſuffer all Trials patiently, with
Conſtancy to bear all their Chains, repreſenting to them that their
Chains were glorious, ſeeing they bore them for the intereſt of
Jeſus Chriſt. After this excellent Workman had thus laboured in
his work about <hi>Nimes,</hi> he was called to <hi>Cerenes</hi> to labour there. He
did not withſtand thoſe that called him; he was at the firſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ready to march and go thither where he was deſired, and
where perſons breathed after the Food that he diſtributed. Before
his departure he believed he was obliged to bid adieu to his Father,
and to prepare him for all thoſe Bonds, and all thoſe Tribulations
that awaited him; and either not being able or not daring to do
it by ſpeaking to him face to face, for fear of expoſing this Father
by being near his Son, or out of an apprehenſion of expoſing this
Son by being near his Father, and ſtopping him in his Careers by
the tenderneſs and efforts of Nature, he took his leave of him by
Letter, the Contents whereof are as follow:</p>

                  <p>WHEN <hi>Abraham</hi> was going up to the Mountain of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijah</hi>
to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a Burnt-Offering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Command he had received from his God, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
not with the Fleſh, but he boldly drew near to that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
where it was ſaid, In the Mountain of the Lord it ſhall
be provided; and in Truth it was there provided, for God
reſted ſatisfied with his Obedience. God hath not ſpoken to me
Face to Face as he ſpake to this Patriarch, but my Conſcience
inſpires me to go and Sacrifice my ſelf for him, and the Intereſt
of his Church. I know not whether God will be ſatisfied with
the deſire I have to do his Will, without expoſing me to Death.
But however it be, his Will be done. If I am taken, do not
murmur againſt him; ſuffer patiently all that it ſhall pleaſe him

As if by this Letter he had ſpoken to God, to Fleſh and Blood,
he was diſingaged from all that which Fleſh and Blood could do
upon him to ſtop him. Immediately after he went thence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards <hi>Cerenes,</hi> where he was impatiently expected, and
where he Abode. He was no ſooner arrived there but he reaſſumed
his Exerciſes there, he publiſh'd the Secrets of Heaven there, he
comforted the Afflicted, and in general fortified all the Faithful,
that made up the Aſſemblies where he was, telling them the Truth
they believed was the only Truth which they ought to believe;
that they ought to preſerve it in its purity, and never ſuffer Men
to mingle their Inventions and Lyes with it; that it was a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi>
which they were bound to preſerve as they had received it, that
they might reſtore it to God ſuch as it was when he entruſted them
with it; that 'twas the Pearl of great price for which they were to
leave all other things; that 'twas a Treaſure which they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to preferr before all the things of the World; not only before
thoſe that are divided from our ſelves, as our Houſes and our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
but alſo our very Lives; that their Profeſſion was the only
way that they were to take to ſave themſelves, to go to God, and
to reach to his Heaven; that they ought to ſeal it with their own
Blood if God called them to it. Champions of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaid
he to them, you that have given back in the Combat, and who
return to the Fight, and you faithful Combatants that hitherto
have not yet ſtirred a foot in the Combat, ſuſtain, ſuſtain all the
Attacks of Satan and his Emiſſaries, bear up againſt all the Efforts
of the Red Dragon, and againſt all the blows of the Troops of
Dragoons that he hath armed againſt you, fortifie your ſelves in the
Lord and in the power of his Strength; put on the whole Armour
of God to reſiſt all the Snares of the Devil, and ſuſtain all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
that you are entering upon. I know the Rage of your Enemies,
that 'tis not ſatisfied with the Evils it hath done you; it will bring
yet greater ones upon you; it waits to glut it ſelf with your Blood
as well as with your Eſtates; there's nothing it will not do to attain
its end upon you; if it ſtops the Paſſages to hinder your flight, 'tis,
it may be, with no other deſign but in the concluſion to draw their
Swords againſt you, and to make uſe of Gibbets and Flames againſt
you; continue firm againſt all thoſe that would take away your
Crown from you, for they are obſtinately ſet on the furious deſign
of taking it away from you; have more conſtancy to reſiſt them than
they have of Force and Fury to Torment you.</p>

By ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe he raiſed up a mighty Repentance in
thoſe whom Temptation had ſhaken and made to fall, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
Conſtancy in them which nothing could ſhake and make
them fall again, with a ſtrong Reſolution in all of them to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God whatever might happen to them; a ſtrong Reſolution to
preſerve inviolably in the midſt of all their Loſſes, and in the midſt
of all ſorts of Sufferings and Torments, that Fidelity they had ſo often
vowed to him, and which they afreſh ſolemnly promiſed to him.
Thus 'twas he fortified them for the ſpace of Six Months, after which,
a little to eaſe himſelf of his Watching and continual Fatigues, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Anduze,</hi> with a deſign to continue his Miniſtry there and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
but there 'twas that he was ſeized: For there he was betray'd
by a certain Perſon of the Province of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> that was an Inhabitant of
<hi>Anduze,</hi> and who had conducted him thither after he had kept Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with him in <hi>Cevents,</hi> and promiſed him faithfully to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him in all his Travels. The Charity of this faithful Servant of
God not being ſuſpicious, he never diſtruſted him that had ſo well
accompanied him, and had promiſed to be ſo faithful to him; he
imparted his Secrets to him, where he did eat, and where he lay;
but like a perfidious <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and a traiterous <hi>Judas</hi> he lifted up the
Heel againſt him, he betrayed him, he ſold him, he delivered him
into the Hands of the <hi>Red Dragons;</hi> who, forgetting nothing of the
Cruelty of their Maſter, exerciſed all ſorts of Inhumanities upon
him. They took him in the Night, and 'twas on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night,
towards the Lord's Day Morning, in a Houſe without the Town,
where he was in a profound Meditation. They had no ſooner ſeized
him but they carried him away with Violence into a Houſe in the
City; one among them, more furious and enraged than the reſt,
took him by the Hair, and dragged him in that manner to Priſon;
he turned to him, and only ſaid to him, <hi>Remember that God will puniſh
thee according to thy Works.</hi> That which he foretold him was ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fulfilled: For this cruel Officer had no ſooner bound him and
lock'd him up in Priſon, but the very ſame Day another Dragoon
reproaching him for his Inhumanity which he had exerciſed upon
him whom he had ſeized and taken Priſoner; he was enraged at him,
drew his Sword againſt him, vomiting out ſeveral Blaſphemies, which
obliged him that had reproached him to draw his Sword in his own
Defence; and God made uſe of it to avenge Innocence and his
Glory; for the Firſt Blow that he gave this cruel Executioner, and
this infamous Blaſphemer, he cut that Hand which this miſerable
Wretch had uſed to bind and to rend this Innocent Perſon; and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66531:6"/>
Second Blow that he gave him he cut his Throat, wherewith he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
againſt God. With theſe Two Blows he died immediately,
and was drowned in his own Blood. Thus did God render to him
ſpeedily, according to his Works, according to the Word of his
Servant. After he had preyed he was made a Prey, when his turn
came; after he had cruelly entreated, he himſelf was cruelly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</p>
            <p>However this did not put a Stop to the Courſe of that Injuſtice
and the Cruelties which were exerciſed againſt the Innocent. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Impriſonment at <hi>Anduze</hi> he was loaden with Irons, and
guarded and watched by Six Dragoons, without having the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of ſeeing any Friend, or receiving any Succour from any Perſon.
Every one was forbid to ſee him and carry him any thing to eat.
There was none could come near him but he whom the Judge had
ordered ſo to do. This Treatment did not make him loſe his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
on the contrary, this Reſemblance of his to his Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abandoned by all in the time of his Sufferings, did only ſerve to
fortify his Heart. He had prepared it for all ſorts of Events; he
found it diſpoſed to ſuffer without Murmuring. He was viſited by
the Judge, who asked him divers Queſtions, of which theſe were
the chief.</p>
            <p>He asked him, Whether he had preached: He anſwered, <hi>Yes,
that 'twas his Duty which God had preſcribed him, and his ordinary
Work.</hi> Afterwards he bid him tell him in what places he had
preached: <hi>Every where,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>where I found the Faithful aſſembled.</hi>
Then he asked him who the Perſons were before whom he preached:
To which he anſwered, <hi>'Twas not his Study to know them, but to teach
them their Duty.</hi> In the Cloſe, he demanded this of him, What End
he propounded to himſelf in preaching to them: <hi>I had this in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>to comfort them, to confirm them in the Fear of God, and
to bring them to Repentance for their Sins.</hi> After theſe Anſwers the
Judge delivered him to Thirty Dragoons to carry him to <hi>Allez.</hi>
When he went out of the Priſon and the Gates of <hi>Anduze</hi> many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
followed him ſighing, and pouring out a Flood of Tears;
which he ſeeing, he turned himſelf to them, and ſaid to them, <hi>Why
do you weep, and why do you thus afflict your Hearts? Weep not for me,
but rather weep for your ſelves and for your Sins, that you may find Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in the Sight of God, and obtain Mercy, which is very neceſſary for
you, and after which you ought always to ſigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being arrived at <hi>Allez,</hi> he was conducted to Priſon, and was again
heard by <hi>Monſieur Le-Ferre,</hi> Lieutenant for criminal Matters at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66531:6"/>
               <hi>Nimes,</hi> to whom he anſwered as to the former, without ever vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and without ever being ſurprized. The Judges never being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to diſcompoſe his Spirit, and gain any thing on him; he was
viſited at <hi>Allez,</hi> as well as at <hi>Anduze,</hi> by the Monks of divers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who uſed all their Efforts to terrify him, and to oblige him
to change his Religion. But all their Efforts were in vain, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found in him the ſame Spirit, the ſame Reſolution, and the
ſame Conſtancy. What he ſaid to them of his Religion and of his
Duty to preach it, and to retain it to his laſt Breath, and to ſuffer
all things for it, ſtruck them ſo home, that going out of Priſon they
could not forbear ſhedding many Tears, and proteſting they never
heard any Man ſpeak ſo well; that this young Man gave an Account
of his Faith in a marvellous Manner. This Teſtimony which they
gave him, made them forbid all other Perſons to enter the Priſon,
and command him to be ſtrictly guarded and loaden with new
Chains. Perſons were appointed to feed him, whoſe Faithfulneſs
and Severity they were well aſſured of, and this under a Pretence, that
they feared leaſt he ſhould be poiſoned.</p>
            <p>When he went out of <hi>Allez,</hi> many Perſons of both Sexes and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Ranks, ran together from all Places of the City to ſee him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Departure; and all in Tears caſt Thouſands of compaſſionate
Looks on him, and poured out many prayers for a Bleſſing on him.
He himſelf looked on them with Eyes full of Charity and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
he bleſs'd them in his Turn, and ardently wiſh'd them the
Benediction of Heaven, vigorouſly exhorting them to ask God Pardon
for their Sins, and to do as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, to go out readily like him
to weep bitterly for their Sin of Infidelity.</p>
            <p>During his ſojourning at <hi>Allez,</hi> and his whole Journey, after he
went thence, he was divers times exhorted by <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Judge in
criminal Caſes, to change his Religion, promiſing him that if he would
no Harm ſhould be done him. He anſwered him, <hi>But wherefore do
you exhort me to change my Religion? Me, who am fully aſſured of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of mine; I had rather die a thouſand times than quit it; ſpeak to me
no more of it I pray you.</hi> After he had ſaid thus to his Judge, he
prayed him to grant him one Favour, which was the only one he had
to demand of him. The Judge having ſaid he would grant it him
if he could: <hi>The Favour,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I have to ask of you, is, That you
would not ſuffer my Father, nor any of my Kindred to enter the Priſon of</hi>
Nimes, <hi>whither you are carrying me.</hi> This he deſired of him, that
he might not awaken the tenderneſſes of Nature, and that he himſelf
might not be ſoftned by it, that he might no more be expoſed to its
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66531:7"/>
Efforts, and no more hear the Cries to which he had bid a perfect
Adieu. Afterwards he deſired him to acquaint his Father and his
neareſt Relations, That he had ſo perfectly reſigned himſelf into the
Hands of God, that the moſt outragious Puniſhment, and the moſt
cruel Death would not diſturb him. Entertaining his Judge after
this manner he arrived at <hi>Nimes,</hi> and it was Night; the Judge not
being willing he ſhould be ſeen by any one, he was forthwith put
into a Dungeon, where he paſſed the Night. The Day after they
put him in the Priſon, bound with ſtrong Chains, guarded and
watch'd, and viſited by none but the Monks, who were not wanting
to viſit him often, and to preſs him in all their Viſits to change his
Religion. But they always found him conſtant, and ſo well reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſuffer all things for the glory of God and for his Truth,
which he had preached and defended, that being raviſh'd with the
Conſtancy of his Spirit, the Tranquillity of his Mind, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
of his Countenance wherewith he ſpake to them, they were
forced to ſay when they returned from him, That they could not in
the leaſt prevail upon him, what fair Promiſes ſoever they made him.
At laſt having brought him out of <hi>Nimes</hi> by Night, he was carried
to <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> and put in the Town-Houſe, always guarded and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
loaden with Chains, and hindred from ſeeing any Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
of all thoſe that bore a part with him in his Sufferings. There
was a Concourſe of Monks to ſee him and ſpeak with him; many
did ſee and ſpeak with him; but what Efforts ſoever they uſed to
diſorder his Spirit, and change his Mind, he always gave them ſo
good a Reaſon of his Faith, and they always found in him ſo much
of Reſolution to ſuffer all things for it, that leaving him they could
only ſay this, That this young Man was ſo ſtrongly reſolved to ſuffer
all things for his Religion, that Death was better to him than Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Intendant comes to make his laſt Attempts upon him;
he ſpoke to him alone, hoping that way to gain ſomewhat upon
him; but he found the ſame Spirit in him as others had done; for
the Spirit of God never forſook him: He exhorted him, he prayed
him, he preſſed him to change his Religion; to that end he made
uſe of all that the Horror of Death, and the Pleaſure of Life, and all
the Advantages of the World contain in them moſt taking with the
Mind of Man; but all this made no Impreſſion on him: Sometimes he
ſaid, <hi>My Lord, I love not the World, nor the Things of the World:
I look on all the Advantages you ſpeak to me of as Dung, I tread all theſe
under my Feet.</hi> At other times he anſwered him, <hi>My Life is not dear
to me, provided I may but gain Chriſt. What Death ſoever I endure for</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66531:7"/>
               <hi>him, it will be very glorious to me. Too happy I, if I die for him, and
for that Cauſe for which he died.</hi> After he had ſpoken like St. <hi>Paul</hi> he
ſpoke like <hi>Polycarp</hi> the famous Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> when the Proconſul
asked him the ſame thing in Priſon; <hi>Exhort me not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to leave
the Maſter that I ſerve; he is ſo good a Maſter that he never did me
any thing but Good ſince I have been in his Service; Should I quit him?
I abhor the thing, ſolicite me no more to abandon him; what Death ſoever
I muſt ſuffer for him, I will never for ſake him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Intendant ſeeing it was impoſſible for him to gain
any thing upon him, brought him to a little Stool, where being ſet
down, he applied himſelf to him in theſe Words, being touched
with the Diſcourſe he had had with him: <hi>Monſieur Rey,</hi> There is
yet time left you to ſave your ſelf. <hi>Yes, my Lord,</hi> ſaid he to him;
<hi>and this is that very time which I will employ about my Salvation. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi>
the Intendant having reaſſum'd his Diſcourſe to ſay to him,
<hi>Monſieur Rey</hi> you muſt change, and you ſhall have your Life: He
replied to him, <hi>Yes, my Lord, I muſt change, but 'tis to go from this
miſerable Earth to the Kingdom of Heaven, where a happy Life awaits
me, which I ſhall have, and which I ſhall ſpeedily poſſeſs. Monſieur</hi> the
Intendant ſaying to him, That he doubted not but they would
keep their Word which they gave him to preſerve his Life. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this Life no more, I am quite looſed from it, I have
no more Hope in it, I ſeek and expect quite another thing, Death is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to me than Life;</hi> adding with the famous Martyr of <hi>Conſtance,
don't think any longer to terrify me with Death; if I had feared it, I
ſhould not be here. God hath given me the Grace to know my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
God will give me Grace to die for it; don't entertain me any longer
about the good things of the World; they have no longer any Reliſh with
me, I am quite diſguſted at them; for all the Treaſureſ of the Earth
I will not leave thoſe of Heaven.</hi> This Conſtancy ſo even and ſo
unſhaken, made <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Intendant ſpeak no more to him about
Religion, but only ask him about the Matter of Fact for which he
was ſet on the little Stool.</p>
            <p>He asked him whether he had preached; he anſwered, <hi>Yes:</hi>
And having asked him where, he told him, <hi>Every where, where I
found the Faithful aſſembled. Monſieur</hi> the Intendant having ſaid
to him that that was contrary to the King's Will, he anſwered him,
<hi>The King of Kings hath alſo commanded me, and 'tis just rather to obey
God than Men.</hi> He anſwered to all the Demands that were made
to him with the ſame Accent in his Words, with a great deal of
Reſpect, Sweetneſs, and Moderation, alway giving Signs of an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66531:8"/>
entire Reſignation to the Will of God, and diſcovering in all his
Diſcourſes and all his Geſtures, that the holy Spirit was poured out
on him in its greateſt Abundance, and that he was helped by Heaven
in an extraordinary manner. This he made appear when being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
ſolicited to think of himſelf, he ſaid, <hi>I have no further need to
conſider what I ſhould do, I have taken my Side, my Reſolution is wholly
taken up, my Buſineſs here is not to be in Suſpence; I am fully ready to
die if God hath ordained it ſhould be ſo; all the Promiſes that can be
made me, ſhall never ſhake me, or hinder me from rendring unto my God
what I owe him.</hi> After this they read his Sentence to him, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
whereof was this, That he ſhould be <hi>hanged,</hi> and that before
he was led to the Gibbet he ſhould be put to the <hi>Torture.</hi> He heard
this Sentence without loſing the Tranquillity of his Mind, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever changing his Colour. After he had heard it, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubled, or growing Pale, <hi>I am treated,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>more kindly
than my Saviour was, in putting me to ſo gentle a Death: I was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be broken, or to be burnt. I thank thee,</hi> cried he immediately,
<hi>O Lord of Heaven and of Earth, for ſo many Favours as thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on me. I thank thee, that thou haſt thought me worthy to ſuffer
for thy Goſpel and to die for thee. I thank thee that thou haſt called me
to ſuffer ſo gentle a Death for thee, after thou hadſt prepared my Heart
to ſuffer more cruelly for the Love of thee.</hi> After he had put up this
Prayer to God, he was put to the Torture; and how ill ſoever they
handled him he never complained; he ſuffered all with a mighty
Patience, ſaying nothing to them that asked him in the time of this
Puniſhment, but only this, <hi>I have ſaid all, I have nothing farther to
anſwer.</hi> The Judges not being able to get any thing further out of
him, cauſed him to be unlooſed; then caſting his Eyes on them he
ſaid to them, <hi>You have now inflicted a Puniſhment on me which I have
not felt at all, I believe you have ſuffered more than I whom you cauſe
to ſuffer; I can proteſt to you, that in the Extremity of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which you would have me endure, I have felt no Pain.</hi> Grace tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
in him ſo ſtrongly above Nature, that it ſeemed as though
Nature had been ſpoiled of her proper Sentiments, ſo that he had
none but thoſe of Grace. They would hearten him up to put him
in a Condition to undergo the laſt Combat whereon this worthy
Sufferer was ſpeedly to enter. To this End they prayed him to eat
a Dinner. He did not withſtand it; he did what he was deſired,
he did eat what was preſented to him, and ſaid to thoſe that gave
him Victuals, <hi>Some eat to live, and as for me I eat to die. See here
the laſt Meal that I ſhall make on Earth, there is prepared this</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:66531:8"/>
               <hi>Evening a Banquet in Heaven, to which I am invited, and whither I ſhall
be conducted by the Angels, thoſe Spirits will ſpeedily take me away to make
me a partaker with them of the delights of Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From that very moment his mind was taken up in nothing but Prayer,
ſinging of Pſalms, Elevations and Tranſports of Soul, that charmed all that
heard him, and pierced the hearts of all that obſerved him. Then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with ſeveral Monks, whom he ſo powerfully diſarmed in ſeveral
Diſcourſes, that they withdrew without having a word to anſwer him, and
without doing any thing when they retired but pouring out a torrent of
Tears. At laſt they brought him out of Priſon to go to the place of his
laſt Puniſhment. Then Two Monks coming near to him, and ſaying to
him, We are here to comfort you; he anſwered, <hi>I have no need of you; I
have a Comforter that is more faithful to me, and who is within me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me.</hi> Theſe Monks being ſomewhat urgent to ſtay near him, ſaid to
him, Are you not willing we ſhould accompany you: <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he to them,
<hi>I have a company of Angels, that are round about my perſon, and have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me, they will be with me to my laſt breath.</hi> He went in the Streets
with an even pace, and with a Countenance ſo contented and ſo aſſured,
that he ſeemed as though he were going to a Feaſt. As he was going to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
having perceived ſome of his Brethren, as he went along he ſaluted
them, and ſeeing they anſwered this Salutation with Tears, which watered
their Cheeks; <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>do you weep for me? Weep for your ſelves
only. As for me, I ſhall quickly be out of Suffering, and far from this valley
of Tears; but here I ſee you, and here I leave you. Stir up your ſelves and
Repent, and God will have pity on you.</hi> The Monks perſiſting in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to accompany him, he prayed them to retire; ſaying, <hi>You are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Comforters, here is nothing for you to do.</hi> Going out by a certain Gate
called the Gate of <hi>Beautiful Proſpect,</hi> he ſaw the Gibbet that was prepared
for him. He had no ſooner ſeen it, but feeling new Tranſports of
Courage and Piety, he cried out, <hi>Courage, Courage, this is the place
which I had a long time propoſed to my ſelf, and for which God himſelf
hath prepared me. How agreeable doth this place appear to me? I ſee
here the Heavens open to receive me, and the holy Angels that keep me
company, all ready to carry me away.</hi> His Zeal firing his Heart and his
Tongue, he began to ſing a Pſalm; but the Officers of Juſtice perceiving
that all the company was deeply affected with what he ſaid; and that his
ardent and piercing Diſcourſes might open their Hearts to the Religion,
they forbad him to ſing aloud: It was difficult to him to reſtrain his fire, to
obey this Order. This Fire which animated him and enflamed him made
him with ſome ardor approach the Ladder. As ſoon as he was come near
it, he cried out, <hi>Oh, how favourable to me is this Ladder! ſeeing it muſt
ſerve me as a ſtep to finiſh my courſe, and mount up to Heaven.</hi> He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the foot of the Ladder, he went up all the Rounds of it ſo chearfully
and ſo ardently, that it appeared plainly that he thought it long till he came
to the laſt. He perceiving in his getting up, that the Monks came up after
him, which made him lift up his Foot not being able to lift up his Hand,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66531:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſay to them, <hi>Retire, I have told you already, and now tell you again, I
have no need of your help: I receive enough of it from my God, to take the
laſt step that remains for me to take, that I may finiſh my whole courſe.</hi>
To this diſcourſe he would have adjoined that of the Victory which he had
already in his hand and of the Triumph, the Glory whereof he already
ſaw; but the Enemies of his Victory and Triumph would not hear his
voice, and ſuffered not any perſon to underſtand him. Like true imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
of the Cruelty of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the moſt Cruel and Idolatrous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
I mean the Ancient Sacrificers to the Idol of <hi>Moloch,</hi> that they
might make this place, where they ſacrificed this innocent Victim, a true
Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> and of <hi>Tophet,</hi> they hindred his voice being heard by the
noiſe of Drums, which they had placed all round the Gibbet, and which
they cauſed to be beat altogether, that their noiſe drowning his, it might
not reach any Ear, nor mollifie any Heart, His ſpectators not being able
to reap any further Benefit from his Oracles which he ſpake, they fixed their
Eyes ſo intently upon him that through the opening of his Mouth and the
great elevation of his Eyes towards Heaven, they diſcovered the motions
of his Zeal, of his Courage and victorious Conſtancy, in ſuch a manner that
even thoſe of the contrary Religion that ſaw him die did confeſs he died a
true Martyr. I appeal to the honeſty of his Spectators to give a teſtimony
to the Truth, to confirm what I have written, and to render to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this illuſtrious Martyr the glory of his Martyrdom, and to God what
is due to his Grace, that made him ſo mightily to triumph; which hath
perfectly crowned him. God grant, my dear Monſieur, That we may
be in a condition to be able to imitate the Zeal and Faithfulneſs of this
worthy Martyr of our days, to follow him in his Reſt and Triumph; this
