            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>It of late is grown so <hi>wanton,</hi> and the humour of <hi>Affecting</hi> it, become so common, that each little <hi>Fop</hi> whose spungy Brain can but coyn a small drossy <hi>Ioque,</hi> or two, presently thinks himself priviledg'd to <hi>Asperse</hi> every Thing that comes in his way though in it self never so <hi>Innocent,</hi> or <hi>beneficial</hi> to the Publick; To the Influence of this predominant <hi>Folly,</hi> we may not improperly refer the Production of those swarms of Insect <hi>Pamphlets</hi> which the Press weekly spawns into the World, and particularly the Nativity of that <hi>Folio-Impertinence</hi> which occasions our present Reflections; A Peice whose <hi>flanting Title</hi> raised our thoughts to an expectation of somewhat extraordinary; But finding little in it but down-right <hi>Abuse,</hi> The Quintessence of <hi>Billingsgate Rhetorick</hi> Dreggs of <hi>Canting,</hi> and such <hi>Rubbish Language,</hi> as <hi>Bubbling, Bully-Rock.,Fluxing, Gonorrhea,</hi> &amp;c. Charity it self could not but <hi>suspect</hi> the Authour more conversant some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else then in <hi>Coffee-houses,</hi> and conclude those places being too <hi>Civil</hi> for a debaucht Humour, had given occasion for his exposing them As <hi>Lay-Conventicles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>However we shall preserve that equal regard to <hi>Solomons</hi> double-fac'd advice, To <hi>Answer</hi> and <hi>not Answer</hi> such as our characterizing Authour, That we shall decline <hi>Retorting</hi> any thing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to his scurrilities; Let the <hi>Town-witt</hi> (whom we leave to take his own satisfaction)

Fence with him if he please at those Weapons; a formall <hi>Answer</hi> would be too great an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to his Vanity, and make him think too <hi>considerably</hi> of himself; Besides to reply in the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyful stile of his <hi>pedling</hi> Drollery is to ingage in a Game at <hi>Push-pin,</hi> And to say any thing <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> will be no more (to borrow his <hi>Phrase</hi>) than <hi>reading a Lecture to a Monkey</hi>; Instead therefore of wasting our own or the Readers <hi>time</hi> so Impertinently, We shall briefly endeavour to give you an Account of the <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Coffee,</hi> and next consider some of those many <hi>conveniences</hi> Coffee-houses afford us both for <hi>business</hi> and <hi>conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the happy <hi>Arabia,</hi> Natures <hi>spicery</hi> prodigally furnishes the voluptuous World with all kind of <hi>Aromaticks</hi> and divers other Rarities, yet I scarce know whether Mankind be not still as <hi>much</hi> obliged to it for the excellent fruit of the humble <hi>Coffee-shrub</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for any other of its more specious productions, For since there is nothing we here enjoy next to Life valuable beyond <hi>Health,</hi> certainly those things that contribute to preserving us in good <hi>plight,</hi> and <hi>eucrasy</hi> and fortifie our weak bodies against the continual Assaults and Batteries of <hi>Diseases</hi> deserve our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards much more, than <hi>Those</hi> which only gratifie a liquorish Palat, or otherwise prove subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to our delights; As for this <hi>salutiferous Berry,</hi> of so general a Use through all the Regions of the <hi>East,</hi> 'tis sufficiently known when prepared to be moderately <hi>hot</hi> and of a very <hi>drying at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating and cleansing Quality,</hi> whence Reason infers That its <hi>decoction</hi> must contain many good <hi>Physical properties,</hi> and cannot but be an Incomparable Remedy to dissolve <hi>Crudities,</hi> comfort the <hi>Brain,</hi> and dry up <hi>Ill Humours</hi> in the Stomach, In brief to prevent or redress in those that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently drink it <hi>All</hi> cold drowzy <hi>Rheumatick</hi> Distempers whatsoever that proceed from Excess of <hi>Moisture,</hi> which are so <hi>numerous,</hi> that but to name them would <hi>Tire</hi> the Tongue of a <hi>Mountebank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This consideration alone should methinks be sufficient to Ingratiate it to our <hi>Esteem,</hi> since the use thereof does thence appear absolutely <hi>necessary,</hi> especially to <hi>us</hi> in whom <hi>Phlegm</hi> is apt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound both by reason of the <hi>Northern</hi> scituation of our Countrey and the ill habit of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>drinking</hi> grown too Epidemicall among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Experience</hi> proves; That there is nothing more effectual than this reviving Drink to restore their <hi>senses</hi> that have <hi>Brutified</hi> themselves by immoderate Tipling heady Liquors which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms by its <hi>exsiccant</hi> property before-mentioned, that instantly dries up that cloud of giddy <hi>Fumes</hi> which boyling up from the over-charged <hi>Stomach,</hi> oppress the <hi>Brain</hi>; But this being only a kindness to <hi>voluntary Divels</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> calls common <hi>Drunkards</hi>) we should scarce reckon amongst <hi>Coffe's</hi> virtues did it not evidence its <hi>quality</hi> and shew how beneficial it may prove by parity of Reason, when designed to more worthy and noble uses, Such as <hi>expelling Wind, fortifying the Liver,</hi> refreshing the <hi>Heart,</hi> Corroborating the <hi>Spirits,</hi> both <hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Animal,</hi> quickning the <hi>Appetite,</hi> assisting <hi>Digestion,</hi> helping the <hi>Stone,</hi> taking away <hi>Rheums</hi> and <hi>Defluxions,</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other kindnesses to Nature, which we might Enumerate, did we not think it a sufficient <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> of its Excellency <hi>only</hi> to observe, <hi>How Vniversally it takes in the World,</hi> For we cannot without an Affront to our <hi>Nature</hi> imagine mankind so <hi>sottish</hi> As greedily to entertain a Drink that has nothing of <hi>sweetness</hi> to recommend it to the Gust, nor any of those pleasant <hi>blandishments</hi> wherewith Wine and other Liquors tempt and debauch our Palates, <hi>unless</hi> there were some more then ordinary <hi>vertue and efficacy</hi> in it, yet we see without any of these insinuating advantages, <hi>Coffee</hi> has so generally, prevail'd that <hi>Bread</hi> it self (though commonly with us voted the <hi>staff of Life</hi>) Is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64684:3"/>
scarce of so universal use, For of that the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> vast and numerous people <hi>Eat</hi> little or none, whereas both they and the <hi>Turks, Persians</hi> and almost all the <hi>Eastern World</hi> are so devoted to <hi>Coffee,</hi> that besides Innumerable <hi>Publick houses</hi> for sale of it, There is scarce a private <hi>Fire</hi> without it all day long; As any that are but moderately acquainted with <hi>Shashes and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants</hi> can witness, Is it not enough to silence the Barking of our <hi>Little Wits</hi> against this Innocent and wholesome Drink That is so generally used by so many mighty <hi>Nations,</hi> and those too cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for the most <hi>witty and Sagavious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor wants this Liquor the <hi>Suffrages</hi> of excellent Authors; The famous <hi>Parkinson</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Herbal p. 1622. commends it for the strengthning weak Stomacks, Helping digestion and obstructions, and Tumours of the Liver and Spleen; The Incomparable <hi>Verulam</hi> in his <hi>Natural History fo.</hi> 155. amongst other encomiums asserts that it comforteth the Brain, and by condensing the Spirits expelleth fear and maketh them strong and chearful; <hi>Sandy's</hi> in his Travels, and the Judicious Sir <hi>H. B.</hi> both in his <hi>Voyage to the Levant</hi> and elsewhere speaks very advantagiously of it, Nor did the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> in his Life time deny it his publick testimony in Print, In a Letter to Mr. Just. <hi>R.</hi> before his <hi>Organon salutis</hi>;</p>
            <p>After so many worthy <hi>Names</hi> have given it their Votes, what have our puisne <hi>Quiblers</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Only this, Tis <hi>black</hi> and therefore Wit must be shown to call it <hi>Stygian Puddle</hi>; And besides this, Tis <hi>bitter,</hi> and therefore a Lye must be fram'd, That it is made of <hi>Soot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, were they but so well acquainted with the <hi>Prince of Latine</hi> Poets As our <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter-maker</hi> would make us believe he is with <hi>Ovid</hi> by his dull <hi>tedious</hi> and Impertinent <hi>Quotation,</hi> They might remember
<q>Alba Ligustra cadunt, vacciuia Nigra Leguntur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the opinion of better <hi>Heads</hi> than any on their <hi>Shoulders</hi> That this Liquor is no other than that famous <hi>Black Broath</hi> of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> so much <hi>celebrated</hi> by Antiquity.</p>
            <p>For it's <hi>Tast</hi> 'tis a pittyful childish humour always to Indulge our Palates, Diseases are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>bitter</hi> Pills, and the most sanative Potions are oft-times very <hi>ungrateful</hi> to swallow, But the truth is, this Drink has nothing in it of <hi>Nauseousness,</hi> nor any Tast but what familiariz'd by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle use will become pleasant and delightful.</p>
            <p>The dull Planet <hi>Saturn</hi> has not finished one Revolution through his Orb since <hi>Coffee-houses</hi> were first known amongst us, yet 'tis worth our wonder to observe how <hi>numerous</hi> they are already grown, not only here in our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> but in both <hi>Vniversities</hi> and most <hi>Cities</hi> and eminent <hi>Towns</hi> throughout the Nation; Nor indeed have we any <hi>Places</hi> of entertainment of more <hi>use</hi> and general <hi>conveniency</hi> in several respects amongst us.</p>
            <p>First, In regard of <hi>easie expence,</hi> being to wait for or meet a Friend, A <hi>Tavern reckoning</hi> soon breeds a Purse-Consumption, In an <hi>Ale-house</hi> you must gorge your self with Pot after Pot, sit dully <hi>alone</hi> or be drawn in to <hi>club</hi> for others reckonings, be frown'd on by your <hi>Landlady</hi> As one that cumbers the house and hinders better Guests, But <hi>here</hi> for a <hi>penny</hi> or two you may spend 2 or 3 hours, have the shelter of a <hi>House,</hi> the warmth of a <hi>Fire,</hi> the diversion of <hi>Company</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency if you please of taking a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> And all this without any grumbling or repining.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For Sobriety, 'tis grown by the Ill Influences of I know not what <hi>Hydroptick Stars</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64684:4"/>
almost a general <hi>custome</hi> amongst us, That no <hi>Bargain</hi> can be drove, or business concluded between Man and Man, but it must be transacted at some <hi>Publick House,</hi> This to Persons <hi>much</hi> concerned in the World must needs be very Injurious, should they always run to <hi>Taverns</hi> or <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> where continual <hi>sippings,</hi> though never so warily would be apt to fly up into their <hi>Brains,</hi> and render them drowsie and indisposed for business; Whereas having now the opportunity of a <hi>Coffee-house,</hi> they repair thither, take each Man a dish or two (so far from <hi>causing</hi> that it <hi>cures</hi> any diz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness or disturbant Fumes) and so dispatching their business, go out more <hi>sprightly</hi> about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs then before; The like may be said of <hi>Mornings draughts</hi> which taken in <hi>Wine Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer,</hi> most times either destroy or very much mayhem the business of the <hi>whole</hi> day, whereas if people would be perswaded to play the <hi>Good-fellows</hi> in this wholesome wakeful Innocent drink, They would find it do no <hi>less</hi> good to their bodies, and much <hi>more</hi> promote and advance their <hi>business</hi> and <hi>Imployments.</hi>

            <p>Lastly, For <hi>diversion,</hi> Tis older than <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and will be true when <hi>Hobs</hi> is forgot, that Man is a <hi>sociable creature,</hi> and delights in <hi>Company,</hi> Now <hi>whether</hi> shall a person wearied with hard study or the laborious turmoils of a tedious day repair to <hi>refresh</hi> himself, or where can young <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> or <hi>Shop-keepers</hi> more Innocently and advantagiously spend an <hi>hour</hi> or two in the Evening then at a <hi>Coffee-house</hi>; where they shall be sure to meet <hi>Company,</hi> and by the custome of the house not <hi>such</hi> as at other places <hi>stingy</hi> and reserved to themselves, but <hi>free</hi> and <hi>communicative,</hi> where every Man may modestly begin his <hi>story,</hi> and <hi>propose</hi> to, or <hi>Answer</hi> another as he thinks fit; <hi>Discourse</hi> Is <hi>Pabulum Animi, cos Ingenij,</hi> The minds best <hi>Dyet,</hi> and the great <hi>Whet-stone</hi> and Incentive of Ingenuity, By <hi>that</hi> we come to know Men better than by their <hi>Physiognomy's, Loquére ut te videam</hi> speak that I may see thee, was the <hi>Phylosophers</hi> Adage, To read <hi>Men</hi> Is acknowledged more useful then <hi>Books,</hi> but where is there a better <hi>Library</hi> for that study generally than <hi>Here,</hi> amongst such a variety of <hi>Humours</hi> all expressing themselves on divers subjects according to their respective Abilities?</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Pamphlet-monger</hi> (that sputters out senceless <hi>Characters</hi> faster than any <hi>Hocus</hi> can vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Inckle</hi>) will needs take upon him to be dictator of all Society, and confine company to sit as mute in a <hi>Coffee-house</hi> As a <hi>Quaker</hi> at a <hi>silent meeting,</hi> or himself with a little Wench when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Hangings they are playing a Game at <hi>Whist,</hi> To this purpose he <hi>babbles</hi> mightily against <hi>Tatling,</hi> and makes a great deal of <hi>cold mirth</hi> with three or four stale Humours that you may find a thousand times better described in a hundred old <hi>Plays,</hi> yet to collect those <hi>excellent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vables</hi> cost the poor Soul above <hi>half</hi> a years time in painful Pilgrimage from one <hi>Coffee-house</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, where planting himself in a dark <hi>corner</hi> with the dexterity of <hi>short-hand</hi> he recorded these <hi>choice Remarks,</hi> whilst all the Town took him for an <hi>Excise-man</hi> counting the number of dishes; the World is now obliged with the fruits of his Industry, which proves no more then that some giddy-headed Coxcombs like himself (whose S<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Author</hi> have raised so much <hi>laughter</hi> through the Town? Besides how infinitely are the <hi>vain pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> of these ridiculous Pragmaticks over-balanced by the <hi>sage</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> Reasonings Here fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be heard of Experienced <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Judicious <hi>Lawyers,</hi> able <hi>Physitians,</hi> Ingenious <hi>Merchants,</hi> and understanding <hi>Citizens,</hi> In the abstrusest points of <hi>Reason, Philosophy, Law</hi> and publick <hi>Commerce</hi>?</p>
            <p>In brief 'tis undenyable That as you have here the most <hi>civil</hi> so 'tis generally the most <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Society,</hi> The frequenting whose <hi>Converse,</hi> and observing their <hi>Discourses</hi> and <hi>Department</hi> cannot but <hi>civilize</hi> our manners, Inlarge our <hi>understandings,</hi> refine our <hi>Language,</hi> teach us a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>confidence</hi> and handsome <hi>Mode of Address</hi>; And <hi>brush</hi> off that <hi>Pudor Subrusticus</hi> (As I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Tully</hi> somewhere calls it) That <hi>clownish kind of modesty,</hi> frequently incident to the <hi>best</hi> Natures, which renders them <hi>Sheepish</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous</hi> in company.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter, spight of the idle <hi>Sarcasms</hi> and paltry reproaches thrown upon it, we may with no less truth than plainness give this brief <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>well regulated Coffee-house</hi> (for our Pen disdains to be <hi>Advocate</hi> for any <hi>sordid holes</hi> that assume that <hi>Name</hi> to cloak the <hi>Practice of Debauchery</hi>) That it is</p>
