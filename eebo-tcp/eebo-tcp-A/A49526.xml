            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet is not the Court to be blamed, but the dilatorie cunning of the Defendants; and we cannot think it reasonable to charge the faylings of men, or other intervening casualties, upon the <hi>Law</hi> or the <hi>Court,</hi> either theirs or ours; the due proceedings of which later are in themselves, as compendious as of any other ordinary Court whatsoever.</p>

                  <head>To the Fowerth and last Reason, We answer.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. That such Courts as ours have been found by long experience to <hi>consist</hi> very well with the most flourishing <hi>Commonwealths</hi> that ever were or are in the world, and with the liberty of those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had or have no other order or manner of proceedings in their Courts then such as is objected to ours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That (as we humbly conceive) the wisdome of this State in former ages thought it fit that our Ancestors should use the practice of the <hi>Civill Lawes</hi> in our Court, the better to traine up young Student<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the knowledge of them, that they might thereby be made more serviceable to the Common-wealth in affaires at home and abroad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That our University Court is of such antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Common Law Bookes, and some very ancient, take frequent notice of it, the proceeding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thereof being alwaies allowed by the Common-Law. And the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cooke</hi> in his Book <hi>Of the Iurisdiction of Courts in England</hi> (lately publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by authority of the Honorable House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) makes honorable mention of the Courts in both the Universities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That if the Cittizens be plaintiffes (as most commonly they are) besides the expedition which they may finde there, They may have the benefit of the Defendants Oath to ease them in their proofe; They may have <hi>good sureties</hi> put into Court not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring in the Defendants but also to <hi>pay the Iudgement and Costs</hi> of Suit, They may <hi>arrest</hi> not only

the Body of any Priviledged person, but also his <hi>goods, debts, and things in Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That though this particular (if it were a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance) does not only concerne the Cittizens of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but <hi>all others</hi> who shall have any commerce or dealing with Schollers or Priviledged persons, yet have <hi>no others</hi> complained of our Court, and the Petitioners of all others have least cause.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That we doe not challenge or exercise any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther jurisdiction over the Petitioners or others in the Vniversity Court then the Cittizens of <hi>Oxon</hi> themselves, and all or most other Citties and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs in <hi>England</hi> doe claime and daily practice without contradiction over all other free-borne people of the Land; to wit, to Arrest and compell them to answer in their respective Courts, <hi>if they can be there legally attached to Answer.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. That we doe not claime or exercise any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other Priviledge in this particular then (as we conceive) is granted to and used by other Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities in <hi>Europe</hi> as well as ours; to wit, to sue and be sued before their own Iudge, a Priviledge indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to them and us <hi>in favour of Learning</hi>; That Schollers may not be called abroad to answer Suits, to the great neglect of their studies, and expence of their time and money.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That in <hi>mixt Suites</hi> where one party is of the Priviledge of the Vniversity, and the other of the Citty since it cannot be otherwise, but such Causes must be heard and determined either in <hi>our Court,</hi> or the <hi>Towne Court,</hi> or both must be subject


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65535:15"/>
to a <hi>forraigne jurisdiction</hi> (which would be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to the Priviledges of both Bodies, no way advantageous unto<hi>them,</hi> and extreamly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for us) we cannot but conceive it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to <hi>justice,</hi> and withall more <hi>convenient</hi> that the Priviledge of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> should herein take place of <hi>theirs,</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Because this Priviledge has been <hi>anciently granted</hi> to us, and we have been many hundred years in <hi>possession</hi> of it, and it is also <hi>confirmed</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by Act of Parliament.</item>
                        <item>2. Because the Iudges in the Vniversity Court, having no interest in the particular Suits brought before them, cannot be thought other then indifferent; Whereas if Scholers should be Sued in the Towne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>3. Because (as we humbly conceive) the Vniversity is still (as it has alwaies been reputed) the more noble Corporation, more Serviceable in the publique, and in which the whole Nation has a greater interest then in the Citty or Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; who for the most part are beholding to the Vniversity for much of their livelyhood and subsist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. That if the Petitioners have no good Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, then their having the Custody and Charge of the <hi>Gaole,</hi> and the power to try the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners</hi> when they purchase such a Commission, and their being liable to <hi>Escapes,</hi> will not entitle them to the <hi>Goods of Felons</hi> (much lesse to <hi>Deodands</hi>) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more known and ordinary then for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

Lords of Franchises to have the Goods of such Felons as were their Tenants, who yet are not kept or tryed at their charges.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We say though the Citty have <hi>one</hi> Gaole with the custody whereof they are charged, yet there is another within the Liberties of the Citty and used by the County, to which the Vniversity does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit most of their Prisoners, and may doe so by all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though they by <hi>charged</hi> with their <hi>Gaole</hi> and <hi>Prisoners,</hi> yet is it very little charges to them: such Prisoners as have where-withall being maintained out of their own goods; and such as have not, by Almes, especially of the Vniversity and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; the Gaoler in the meane time making a good advantage of his place by Fees and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>

                  <head>XI. To the Reasons of the Eleaventh Greivance</head>
                  <p>We answer. 1. That it is one of the most ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the University that the Priviledged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thereof may use any <hi>Trade</hi> and exercise any Merchandize in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or the Suburbs thereof as freely as any Cittizen; and this hath been confirmed anto us not onely by Act of Parliament, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Parliament, but also by Indentures of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position between the two Bodies, whereby the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged persons have been ascertained that should exercise such trade and Merchandize; who in that regard are to be talliable by scot and lot and other charges with the Free-men of the Citty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee doe not otherwise then according to this priviledge assume power to set up Trades within the Citty; nor doe we authorize <hi>Forreigners</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Trades in <hi>Oxon,</hi> other then such as by the Law of the Land and Priviledge of the University are and ought to be allowed, however some of them have of late yeares been unjustly molested by the Cittizens for so doing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We deny that the Citty ha's any <hi>Charter</hi> so confirmed as is pretended to exclude Priviledged priviledged persons from exercising lawfull Trades and selling by retaile within the Citty, though they be not of their Guild; no such Charter having hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been produced upon former Hearings when this point has been in debate betwixt us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lastly we humbly conceive this Libertie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

in equity and good conscience bee taken from Priviledged persons, who are many of them Butlers and Manciples, or other Officers and Servants to the University and the Colleges and Halls therein, having Wives and Children to maintaine, which they cannot otherwise doe then by Exercising law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Trades; their small wages &amp; allowances which they receive by their respective places being scarce sufficient to maintaine them in meat and cloathes and other necessaries, if they were single persons and had no other charge.</p>

                  <p>By what hath been said on either party we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it does sufficiently appeare that some of the particulars in controversy betwixt us (which the Vniversity claimes as their iust and ancient <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> and the Citty complaine of as <hi>Grievances</hi>) doe concerne meerely matter of <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>interest</hi>
